Higher ocean surface topography in the western Pacific than found in the Indian Ocean drives upper thermocline water from the North Pacific through the western route of the Makassar Strait to either directly exit through the Lombok Strait or flow eastward into the Banda Sea. Weaker flows of saltier and denser South Pacific water pass over the Lifamatola Passage into the Banda Sea, where these waters mass are mixed due to tidal effects, Ekman pumping, and heat and freshwater flux at the ocean surface. From the Banda Sea the ITF exits Timor, Ombai, and Lombok passages. The location and topography of the channels that make up the ITF are shown in the Figure. Lombok Strait is 300m deep and roughly 35 km wide and the currents vary between 0.286 m/s (0.6 mi/hr) eastward to 0.67 m/s westward and average 0.25 m/s westward. Currents in Ombai vary between 0.12 m/s eastward to 0.16 m/s westward, averaging 0.11 m/s westward and are funneled within the 1250m deep and 35 km wide passage. Timor passage, which is 1890 m deep by 160 km wide, is the widest of the exit pathways and averages only 0.02 m/s. From 2004‚Äì2006, 11 moorings were deployed across the entrance and exit regions of the ITF and were positioned to accurately measure each passage‚Äôs contribution as part of the International Nusantara Stratification and Transport (INSTANT) program. Flow in through Makassar (11.6 Sv, 1 Sv = 106 m¬≥/s) and Lifamatola (1.1 Sv) sums to 12.7 Sv. Total outflow transport corresponds to 15.0 Sv (varying from 10.7 to 18.7 Sv) and is made up of Lombok (2.6 Sv), Ombai (4.9 Sv) and Timor (7.5 Sv) contributions.Sprintall, J., S.E. Wijffels, R.

Heat Transport of the Indonesian Throughflow is 1.087 PW (1 PW=1015 Watt).‚ÄúHeat transport through Indonesian throughflow by Vivek Kumar Pandey and Avinash Chand Pandey in J. Ind. Geophys. Union ( October 2006 ) Vol.10, No.4, pp.273-277‚Äù. (PDF) ITF heat transport result from POM Model. Circulation and transport within the Indonesian Seas vary along with large-scale monsoon flow. During June to August, southeasterlies of the southwest monsoon predominate over Indonesia and drive strong Ekman divergence (southwestward flow in the Southern Hemisphere thus increasing ITF to 15 Sv) whereas from December to February, Northwest Monsoon westerlies serve to directly reduce the ITF. During monsoon transitions, strong westerly winds in the eastern Indian Ocean force equatorial downwelling Kelvin waves (eastward moving, eastward flow) that propagate through the Indonesian passages as coastally trapped Kelvin waves and serve to reduce the ITF flow with a minimum in April of 9 Sv. Another way to think about it is that downwelling on the Indian Ocean side increases sea level and so reduces the normal Pacific-to-Indian pressure head reducing the flow. Global-scale, ocean waves such as equatorial/coastal Kelvin and Rossby waves drive interannual variation of the ITF with an amplitude of roughly +/-3 Sv.Schiller, A., S.E. Wijffels, J. Sprintall, R. Molcard, and P.R. Oke, Pathways of intraseasonal variability in the Indonesian Throughflow region, Dynamics of Atmospheres and Oceans, 50 (2), 174-200, 2010. Western- central Pacific westerly winds from El Nino force westward moving-equatorial Rossby waves and eastward currents that hit eastern New Guinea and propagate around the west coast as coastal Kelvin waves and down through the ITF along the west Australia Shelf coast serving to reduce the ITF. Upwelling (i.e. reduced sea level) associated with Rossby waves on the Pacific side reduces the Pacific-to-Indian pressure gradient and reduces the ITF. Interannual variability of Indian Ocean westerlies acts in the same manner as the seasonal equatorial Kelvin waves to reduce the normal westward ITF flow as well. An important feature of the Indonesian Throughflow is that because the water in the western equatorial Pacific Ocean has a higher temperature and lower salinity than the water in the Indian Ocean, the Throughflow transports large amounts of relatively warm and fresh water to the Indian Ocean. When the Indonesian Throughflow (through Lombok Strait, Ombai and the Timor Passages) enters the Indian Ocean it is advected towards Africa within the Indian South Equatorial Current. There it eventually exits the Indian Ocean with the Agulhas Current around South Africa into the Atlantic Ocean. So the Indonesian Throughflow transports a significant amount of Pacific Ocean heat into the southwest Indian Ocean, which is approximately away from the Lombok Strait.Indonesian Throughflow - Marine Research  See also  * Ocean gyre * Throughflow  References   External links  * The Indonesian Throughflow at whoi.edu.

It was founded in May 1991 by Bavarian disc jockey Rudolf \\"Rudy\\" Ratzinger (born June 3, 1966).  History  Rudy Ratzinger was the creative force behind Wumpscut, occasionally employing the help of guest artists (such as Aleta Welling, P¬∑A¬∑L, Selene etc.). Ratzinger cites the influence of such bands as Le√¶ther Strip as his reason for making the transfer from DJing to recording music: \\"I was a DJ for several years and was tired of offering the audience only alien stuff. The first Le√¶ther Strip works were responsible for trying something on my own.\\" First works performed by Wumpscut dates back to the early 1990s when Rudy Ratzinger started to play music in Bavarian club houses and in Southern Germany. In a 1997 interview, Rudy Ratzinger reveals that \\"Pornography\\" and \\"War Combattery\\" were his first two songs in EBM, those two four-minute songs are to be found on Defcon, the first demo issued by Wumpscut in late 1991. Yet, only \\"Pornography\\" was picked for reappearance on Blutkind (although a remix of War Combattery surfaced on the Mesner Tracks re- release EP which was released before). According to Rudy, \\"War Combattery\\" was a great hit in club houses: \\"[It] was a very big success in the clubs in Southern Germany.\\" The release of the song \\"Soylent Green\\", which is named after the 1973 movie and also contains audio samples from the German dubbed version, first attracted attention to Wumpscut. Since its release in 1993, it has become a frequently played song at events and clubs in the goth and industrial subcultures, in Germany, UK and the United States. Wumpscut produced elaborate box set releases including limited versions of CD or LP releases with additional and bonus material (bonus tracks, \\"liquid soylent\\" energy drinks, posters, pins, stickers, bags, flags, etc.). Wumpscut albums were reissued with variant artworks, remastering and track listings. Standalone merchandise such as baseball caps, coffee mugs and t-shirts were also made available for purchase. Rudy Ratzinger has to date released seventeen studio albums plus a number of compilations: demos, compilation tracks, and remixes from deleted singles and EPs. The sixteenth Wumpscut album, W√ºterich, released March 25, 2016 on the Metropolis label. He released a \\"best of\\" album titled Innerfire on May 5th, 2017, while also announcing that Wumpscut would no longer be producing or making any new music on his Facebook and Twitter accounts.  Record labels  Ratzinger started his own record label, Beton Kopf Media, in 1995, used exclusively to release Wumpscut material to the European market. In 1996, he started the label Mental Ulcer Forges which lapsed in the early 2000s, then relaunched in 2006. The label released albums by the following bands: Remyl, Noisex, B-Ton-K, Yendri and F/A/V. Rudy also managed the label Fleisskoma with Karl Kimmerl (B-Ton-K), which has released work by the electronic band Press to Transmit.  Live performance  Despite the project's popularity in the electro-industrial genre, Wumpscut was a studio-only project and never toured.

(Photo from 1975 plague victim) A map of the Byzantine Empire in 550 (a decade after the Plague of Justinian) with Justinian's conquests shown in green The Plague of Justinian or Justinianic Plague (541‚Äì549 AD) was the beginning of the first plague pandemic, the first Old World pandemic of plague, the contagious disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. The disease afflicted the entire Mediterranean Basin, Europe, and the Near East, severely affecting the Sasanian Empire and the Roman Empire and especially its capital, Constantinople. The plague is named for the Roman emperor in Constantinople, Justinian I (r. 527‚Äì565), who according to his court historian Procopius contracted the disease and recovered in 542, at the height of the epidemic which killed about a fifth of the population in the imperial capital. The contagion arrived in Roman Egypt in 541 and spread around the Mediterranean Sea until 544; in Northern Europe and the Arabian Peninsula, persisting until 549. In 2013, researchers confirmed earlier speculation that the cause of the Plague of Justinian was Yersinia pestis, the same bacterium responsible for the Black Death (1347‚Äì1351). The latter was much shorter, but still killed an estimated one-third to one-half of Europeans. Ancient and modern Yersinia pestis strains closely related to the ancestor of the Justinian plague strain have been found in Tian Shan, a system of mountain ranges on the borders of Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and China, suggesting that the Justinian plague originated in or near that region. The Plague of Justinian is the first and the best known outbreak of the first plague pandemic, which continued to recur until the middle of the 8th century. Some historians believe the first plague pandemic was one of the deadliest pandemics in history, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 25‚Äì100 million people during two centuries of recurrence, a death toll equivalent to almost half of Europe's population at the time of the first outbreak. The plague's social and cultural impact has been compared to that of the Black Death (the second plague pandemic) that devastated Eurasia in the 14th century. Research published in 2019 argued that the two-hundred-year-long pandemic's death toll and social effects have been exaggerated, comparing it to the modern third plague pandemic (1855-1960s).  History  Partially-completed basilica in Philippi; its construction is believed to have been halted by the Plague of Justinian. The Byzantine historian Procopius first reported the epidemic in 541 from the port of Pelusium, near Suez in Egypt. Two other firsthand reports of the plague's ravages were by the Syriac church historian John of EphesusJohn of Ephesus, Ecclesiastical History, part 2. Translation of relevant portions here. and Evagrius Scholasticus, who was a child in Antioch at the time and later became a church historian. Evagrius was afflicted with the buboes associated with the disease but survived. During the disease's four returns in his lifetime, he lost his wife, a daughter and her child, other children, most of his servants and people from his country estate.Evagrius, Historia Ecclesiae, IV.29. According to contemporary sources, the outbreak in Constantinople was thought to have been carried to the city by infected rats on grain ships arriving from Egypt. To feed its citizens, the city and outlying communities imported large amounts of grain, mostly from Egypt. The rat (and flea) population in Egypt thrived on feeding from the large granaries maintained by the government. Procopius,Procopius, Persian War II.22‚Äì23. in a passage closely modelled on Thucydides, recorded that at its peak the plague was killing 10,000 people in Constantinople daily, but the accuracy of the figure is in question, and the true number will probably never be known. He noted that because there was no room to bury the dead, bodies were left stacked in the open. Funeral rites were often left unattended to, and the entire city smelled like the dead.Procopius: The Plague, 542 In his Secret History, he records the devastation in the countryside and reports the ruthless response by the hard- pressed Justinian: > When pestilence swept through the whole known world and notably the Roman > Empire, wiping out most of the farming community and of necessity leaving a > trail of desolation in its wake, Justinian showed no mercy towards the > ruined freeholders. Even then, he did not refrain from demanding the annual > tax, not only the amount at which he assessed each individual, but also the > amount for which his deceased neighbors were liable.Procopius, Anekdota, > 23.20f. As a result of the plague in the countryside, farmers could not take care of crops and the price of grain rose in Constantinople. Justinian had expended huge amounts of money for wars against the Vandals in the region of Carthage and the Ostrogoths' kingdom in Italy. He had invested heavily in the construction of great churches, such as Hagia Sophia. As the empire tried to fund the projects, the plague caused tax revenues to decline through the massive number of deaths and the disruption of agriculture and trade. Justinian swiftly enacted new legislation to deal more efficiently with the glut of inheritance suits being brought as a result of victims dying intestate.Justinian, Edict IX.3; J. Moorhead 1994; Averil Cameron, The Mediterranean World in Late Antiquity, AD 395‚Äì600, 1993:111. The plague's long-term effects on European and Christian history were enormous. As the disease spread to port cities around the Mediterranean, the struggling Goths were reinvigorated and their conflict with Constantinople entered a new phase. The plague weakened the Byzantine Empire at a critical point, when Justinian's armies had nearly retaken all of Italy and the western Mediterranean coast; the evolving conquest would have reunited the core of the Western Roman Empire with the Eastern Roman Empire. Although the conquest occurred in 554, the reunification did not last long. In 568, the Lombards invaded Northern Italy, defeated the small Byzantine army that had been left behind and established the Kingdom of the Lombards. Gaul suffered severely, so it is unlikely that Britain escaped.Charles-Edwards, Wales and the Britons, p. 216  Epidemiology  = Genetics of the Justinian plague strain = The Plague of Justinian is generally regarded as the first historically recorded epidemic of \\"Yersinia pestis\\". This conclusion is based on historical descriptions of the clinical manifestations of the diseaseProcopius, History of the Wars, 7 Vols., trans. H. B. Dewing, Loeb Library of the Greek and Roman Classics, (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1914), Vol. I, pp. 451‚Äì473. and the detection of Y. pestis DNA from human remains at ancient grave sites dated to that period.Wiechmann I, Grupe G. Detection of Yersinia pestis DNA in two early medieval skeletal finds from Aschheim (Upper Bavaria, 6th century A.D.)\\" Am J Phys Anthropol 2005 Jan;126(1) 48‚Äì55 Genetic studies of modern and ancient Yersinia pestis DNA suggest that the origin of the Justinian plague was in Central Asia. The most basal or root level existing strains of the Yersinia pestis as a whole species are found in Qinghai, China. After samples of DNA from Yersinia pestis were isolated from skeletons of Justinian plague victims in Germany, it was found that modern strains currently found in the Tian Shan mountain range system are most basal known in comparison with the Justinian plague strain. Additionally, a skeleton found in Tian Shan dating to around 180 AD and identified as an \\"early Hun\\" was found to contain DNA from Yersinia pestis closely related to the Tian Shan strain basal ancestor of the Justinian plague strain German samples. This finding suggests that the expansion of nomadic peoples who moved across the Eurasian steppe, such as the Xiongnu and the later Huns, had a role in spreading plague to West Eurasia from an origin in Central Asia. Earlier samples of Yersinia pestis DNA have been found in skeletons dating from 3000 to 800 BC, across West and East Eurasia. The strain of Yersinia pestis responsible for the Black Death, the devastating pandemic of bubonic plague, does not appear to be a direct descendant of the Justinian plague strain. However, the spread of Justinian plague may have caused the evolutionary radiation that gave rise to the currently extant 0ANT.1 clade of strains. = Virulence and mortality rate = The number of deaths is uncertain. Some modern scholars believe that the plague killed up to 5,000 people per day in Constantinople at the peak of the pandemic. According to one view, the initial plague ultimately killed perhaps 40% of the city's inhabitants and caused the deaths of up to a quarter of the human population of the Eastern Mediterranean.Cyril A. Mango, Byzantium: The Empire of New Rome (1980) emphasizes the demographic effects; Mark Whittow, \\"Ruling the late Roman and Byzantine city\\", Past and Present 33 (1990) argues against too great reliance on literary sources. Frequent subsequent waves of the plague continued to strike throughout the 6th, 7th and 8th centuries, with the disease becoming more localized and less virulent. A revisionist view expressed by scholars such as Lee Mordechai and Merle Eisenberg has recently argued that the mortality of the Justinian Plague was far lower than previously believed. The authors argue that the plague might have caused high mortality in specific places, it did not cause widespread demographic decline or decimate Mediterranean populations. Any direct mid-to-long term effects of plague were minor.

A total of 645 were produced. The name was derived from the Lagonda marque that Aston Martin had purchased in 1947. There are two distinct generations, the original, the short lived 1974 design based on a lengthened Aston Martin V8, and the entirely redesigned, wedge-shaped Series 2 model introduced in 1976 along with subsequent evolutions. In 2014, Aston Martin confirmed it would launch a new Lagonda model called the Taraf for the Middle- East market, sold on an invitation only basis which is considered to be the successor of the Lagonda saloon. History Aston Martin was facing financial pressure in the mid-1970s and needed something to bring in some much-needed funds. Traditionally, Aston Martin had worked on 2+2 sports cars, but the Lagonda was a four-door saloon. As soon as it was introduced, it drew in hundreds of deposits from potential customers, helping Aston Martin's cash reserves. The 1976 wedge-shaped styling contrasted sharply with other cars of its day After the production of seven Series 1 cars, the Lagonda was designed from the ground up in 1976 by William Towns as an extreme interpretation of the classic 1970s \\"folded paper\\" style. It was an unconventional design practice for Aston Martin and still is. Together with famous contemporaries like the Lamborghini Countach, Lotus Esprit, and the DMC DeLorean, the Lagonda is frequently named among the most striking wedge-shaped designs of all.Wedge of Tomorrow: 20 of the Greatest Sports Cars of the '70s and '80sThe Thin End of the Wedge ‚Äì RAC Cars20 Radical Wedge-Shaped Cars ‚Äì Best Wedge Shaped Vehicles ‚Äì Road and Track Car enthusiasts are fiercely divided on the car's aesthetic value. The Lagonda combined striking styling with premium leather interior, and advanced instrumentation for its time. Coupled to a Chrysler three-speed \\"TorqueFlite\\" automatic transmission its four-cam carbureted V8 provided poor, often single-digit, fuel economy, little improved by the change to fuel-injection in the Series 3. Throughout the history of the marque, the hand-built Lagonda was amongst the most expensive luxury saloons in the world. The only other production cars to approach its price tag were the Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit/Silver Spur and the Bentley Mulsanne. The Lagonda was the first production car to use a digital instrument panel. The development cost for the electronics alone on the Lagonda came to four times as much as the budget for the whole car. The Series 3 used cathode ray tubes for the instrumentation, which proved even less reliable than the original model's light-emitting diode (LED) display. It was named by Bloomberg Businessweek as one of the 50 ugliest cars of the last 50 years and Time Magazine included it in its \\"50 Worst Cars of All Time\\", describing it as a mechanical \\"catastrophe\\" with electronics that would be impressive if they ever worked. Models A number of iterations of the Lagonda were produced during its production lifespan.

The Series 4 was launched at the Geneva Motor Show in March 1987 and received a significant exterior facelift by the car's original designer William Towns. The car's sharp edges were rounded off and the pop-up headlights were eliminated, with a new arrangement of triple headlights on each side of the grille being the most obvious alteration, along with the removal of the side swage line (or character line) and the introduction of 16-inch wheels. With production of around one car per week, 105 Series 4 cars were manufactured. The last car was produced during January 1990. 81 remain registered in the United Kingdom , down only slightly from 94 in 1994, but 32 of the surviving examples are SORN. =Special variants= 1998 Roos Engineering's Shooting-brake Lagonda Aftermarket variations of the Lagonda included: * Tickford Lagonda (1983) ‚Äì Five Series 2 Lagondas were sold with a bodykit and upgraded interiors. * Tickford limousine (1984) ‚Äì Four long-wheelbase Lagondas were made, at a cost of GB¬£110,000 each.

He made contributions in the fields of poetics and the philosophy of science. To the latter he introduced the concepts of epistemological obstacle and epistemological break (obstacle √©pist√©mologique and rupture √©pist√©mologique). He influenced many subsequent French philosophers, among them Michel Foucault, Louis Althusser, Dominique Lecourt and Jacques Derrida, as well as the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu. For Bachelard the scientific object should be constructed and therefore, different from the positivist sciences, information is in continuous construction. Empiricism and rationalism are not regarded as dualism or opposition but complementary, therefore studies of a priori and a posteriori or in other words reason and are dialectic and are part of scientific research. Life and work Bachelard was a postal clerk in Bar-sur-Aube, and then studied physics and chemistry before finally becoming interested in philosophy. To obtain his doctorate (doctorat √®s lettres) in 1927, he wrote two theses: the main one, Essai sur la connaissance approch√©e, under the direction of Abel Rey, and the complementary one, √âtude sur l'√©volution d'un probl√®me de physique : la propagation thermique dans les solides, supervised by L√©on Brunschvicg. He was a professor at the University of Dijon from 1930 to 1940 and then was appointed chair in the history and philosophy of science at the University of Paris. In 1958 he became a member of the Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium.Index biographique des membres et associ√©s de l'Acad√©mie royale de Belgique (1769-2005) p 19. = Bachelard's psychology of science = Bachelard's studies of the history and philosophy of science in such works as Le nouvel esprit scientifique (\\"The New Scientific Spirit\\", 1934) and La formation de l'esprit scientifique (\\"The Formation of the Scientific Mind\\", 1938) were based on his vision of historical epistemology as a kind of psychoanalysis of the scientific mind. In the English-speaking world, the connection Bachelard made between psychology and the history of science has been little understood. Bachelard demonstrated how the progress of science could be blocked by certain types of mental patterns, creating the concept of obstacle √©pist√©mologique (\\"epistemological obstacle\\"). One task of epistemology is to make clear the mental patterns at use in science, in order to help scientists overcome the obstacles to knowledge. Another goal is to ‚Äúgive back to human reason its function of agitation and aggressiveness‚Äù as Bachelard put it in ‚ÄòL'engagement rationaliste‚Äô (1972). = Epistemological breaks: the discontinuity of scientific progress = Bachelard was critical of Auguste Comte's positivism, which considered science as a continual progress. To Bachelard, scientific developments such as Einstein's theory of relativity demonstrated the discontinuous nature of the history of sciences. Thus models that framed scientific development as continuous, such as that of Comte and √âmile Meyerson, seemed simplistic and erroneous to Bachelard. Through his concept of \\"epistemological break\\", Bachelard underlined the discontinuity at work in the history of sciences. However the term \\"epistemological break\\" itself is almost never used by Bachelard, but became famous through Louis Althusser. He showed that new theories integrated old theories in new paradigms, changing the sense of concepts (for instance, the concept of mass, used by Newton and Einstein in two different senses). Thus, non-Euclidean geometry did not contradict Euclidean geometry, but integrated it into a larger framework. = The role of epistemology in science = Bachelard was a rationalist in the Cartesian sense, although he recommended his \\"non-Cartesian epistemology\\" as a replacement for the more standard Cartesian epistemology.The New Scientific Mind, conclusion. He compared \\"scientific knowledge\\" to ordinary knowledge in the way we deal with it, and saw error as only illusion: \\"Scientifically, one thinks truth as the historical rectification of a persistent error, and experiments as correctives for an initial, common illusion (illusion premi√®re).\\"The New Scientific Mind, VI, 6. The role of epistemology is to show the history of the (scientific) production of concepts; those concepts are not just theoretical propositions: they are simultaneously abstract and concrete, pervading technical and pedagogical activity. This explains why \\"The electric bulb is an object of scientific thought‚Ä¶ an example of an abstract-concrete object.\\"in Le Rationalisme appliqu√© (1949, 2nd ed. of 1962, p. 104ff). To understand the way it works, one has to take the detour of scientific knowledge. Epistemology is thus not a general philosophy that aims at justifying scientific reasoning. Instead it produces regional histories of science. = Shifts in scientific perspective = Bachelard saw how seemingly irrational theories often simply represented a drastic shift in scientific perspective. For instance, he claimed that the theory of probabilities was just another way of complexifying reality through a deepening of rationality (even though critics like Lord Kelvin found this theory irrational).The New Scientific Mind, V (p. 120 French ed., 1934). One of his main theses in The New Scientific Mind was that modern sciences had replaced the classical ontology of the substance with an \\"ontology of relations\\", which could be assimilated to something like a process philosophy. For instance, the physical concepts of matter and rays correspond, according to him, to the metaphysical concepts of the thing and of movement; but whereas classical philosophy considered both as distinct, and the thing as ontologically real, modern science can not distinguish matter from rays: it is thus impossible to examine an immobile thing, which was precisely the condition for knowledge according to classical theory of knowledge (Becoming being impossible to be known, in accordance with Aristotle and Plato's theories of knowledge). In non-Cartesian epistemology, there is no \\"simple substance\\" as in Cartesianism, but only complex objects built by theories and experiments, and continuously improved (VI, 4). Intuition is therefore not primitive, but built (VI, 2). These themes led Bachelard to support a sort of constructivist epistemology. = Other academic interests = In addition to epistemology, Bachelard's work deals with many other topics, including poetry, dreams, psychoanalysis, and the imagination. The Psychoanalysis of Fire (1938) and The Poetics of Space (1958) are among the most popular of his works: Jean- Paul Sartre cites the former and Bachelard's Water and Dreams in his Being and Nothingness (1943), and the latter had a wide reception in architectural theory circles. In philosophy, this nocturnal side of his work is developed by his student Gilbert Durand.

His name however became most closely associated with patriotic songs including 'Mere Desh Ki Dharti' in Manoj Kumar's film Upkaar.PM condoles Mahendra Kapoor's death Press Trust of India He always considered Mohammad Rafi as his guru and cited many time that he was the best singer to be ever born.In 1972, he was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India. He lent his voice to actor Manoj Kumar in most of his films and had a lengthy association with director-producer B.R. Chopra. Biography Mahendra Kapoor was born in Amritsar, but soon moved to Mumbai. At an early age he was inspired by legendary singer Mohammed Rafi and considered him his mentor, he started learning classical music under classical singers like Pt. Hussanlal, Pt. Jagannath Bua, Ustad Niaz Ahmed Khan, Ustad Abdul Rehman Khan and Pt.Tulsidaas Sharma. Kapoor created a style of his own moulded largely on Rafi, and won the Metro Murphy All-India singing competition, which led to his debut as a playback singer in V. Shantaram's Navrang in 1958, singing Aadha Hai Chandrama Raat Aadhi, under the musical direction of C. Ramchandra.http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-09-28/mumbai/27946493_1_raj- kapoor-mahendra-kapoor-lata-mangeshkar-award Mere desh ki dharti' will always be with us Some of Kapoor's most notable songs were the ones he performed in B.R. Chopra's films (Dhool Ka Phool, Gumrah, Waqt, Hamraaz, Dhund, Nikaah and Awam (film) and TV series Mahabharat; and for Manoj Kumar (Upkaar, Purab Aur Paschim). Kapoor had a very large vocal range, and he is sometimes known as The Vibrant Voice of India. He was the first Indian playback singer to record music in English. He was asked by the group Boney M to sing their songs in Hindi with Musarat from Pakistan, which resulted in the Pop Album M-3. Some of the songs on the album are \\"Chori Chori Chalo!!\\"(Original, Hoorray! Hoorray! by Boney M), \\"O Meri Champe Ki Daali\\". Most of the hit songs sung by Mahendra Kapoor which are famous, are from B. InR. Chopra movies or Manoj Kumar's movies. His song from 'Bandhan', 'Shakti'. 'Doli', 'Ek Nazar', 'Admi Aur Insaan', 'Sangam', 'Tawaif' are also quite popular. Mahendra Kapoor also sang a duet with Mohammed Rafi. The song was \\"Kaisi Haseen Aaj Baharon Ki Raat\\" from the 1967 film \\"Aadmi\\", which was originally recorded as a duet with Rafi and Talat Mehmood. Manoj Kumar, one of the lead stars refused to use Talat's voice for him and the song was re-recorded with Kapoor replacing Talat. Kapoor sung in a large number of Indian languages, and is the playback singer who has performed in the largest number of in Gujarati, Punjabi, Bhojpuri and Marathi movies. In Marathi he was very popular for being the voice of Dada Kondke in all his movies. In spite of being associated with Dada Kondke's colloquial style his singing for Marathi movies was not limited to Dada Kondke's movies only. Kapoor was married and had three daughters and one son. His son Rohan Kapoor is an actor and singer, who acted in a few films in the 1980s such as Yash Chopra's Faasle (1985) and Love 86 (1986), and Prakash Mehra's Imandaar, and later did stage shows together with his father. On 27 September 2008, Kapoor died following a cardiac failure at his home in Mumbai, aged 74. He was survived by his wife, children, children-in-law and grandchildren. Mahendra Kapoor is one of the golden era singers.

It is the administrative centre of the Municipality of Tolmin. Geography Tolmin stands on the southern rim of the Julian Alps and is the largest settlement in the Upper Soƒça Valley (), close to the border with Italy. It is located on a terrace above the confluence of the Soƒça and Tolminka rivers, positioned beneath steep mountainous valleys. The old town gave its name to the entire Tolmin area () as its economic, cultural and administrative centre. The area is located in the historic Gori≈°ka region, itself part of the larger Slovene Littoral, about north of Nova Gorica and west of the Slovene capital Ljubljana. In the north, the road leads further up the Soƒça River to Bovec, with an eastern branch-off to ≈†kofja Loka and Idrija. History Assumption of Mary Parish Church Early inhabitants were Illyrians in Tolmin area. It was ruled successively by the Roman Empire, Odoacer, the Ostrogoths, the Eastern Roman Empire and part of the Lombard Duchy of Friuli until it was conquered by the Frankish king Charlemagne in 774 and replaced by the Carolingian March of Friuli. Ancestors of Slovenes had come to this area during the Slavic settlement of the Eastern Alps from about 600 onwards, embattled by Avar raids. It was passed to Middle Francia in 843 after the Treaty of Verdun and in 952 passed to the vast March of Verona, which was initially ruled by the Dukes of Bavaria, from 976 by the Carinthian dukes. King Henry IV of Germany ceded it to the newly established Patria del Friuli in 1077, before it was occupied by the Republic of Venice in 1420. Finally the Tolmin area was conquered by the Habsburg Emperor Maximilian I during the War of the League of Cambrai in 1509. Tolmin was then ruled with the possessions of the extinct Counts of Gorizia as part of the Inner Austrian territories of the Habsburg Monarchy. In 1713 it was the centre of a peasant revolt against increased taxation and the local Count Coronini.Treasures of Yugoslavia, An encyclopedic touring guide, Beograd, 1982. It was part of the Illyrian Provinces, which were part of Napoleonic French Empire between 1809 and 1814 before returning to Austrian rule. Until 1918, the town (under bilingual names Tolmein - Tolmin) was part of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy (Austrian side after the compromise of 1867) and head of the district of the same name, one of the 11 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in the Austrian Littoral province. A post-office was opened in October 1850 under the German name (only).Die postalischen Abstempelungen auf den √∂sterreichischen Postwertzeichen-Ausgaben 1867, 1883 und 1890, Wilhelm KLEIN, 1967 After World War I it was ruled by the Kingdom of Italy between 1918 and 1943 (nominally to 1947). It was a county (comune) center in Province of Gorizia between 1918 and 1923 and again between 1927 and 1943 (nominally to 1947) and in Province of Friuli between 1923 and 1927 during Italian rule as Tolmino. After the Italian caputilation, it was occupied by Nazi Germany in 1943 and was part of Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral before liberation by Yugoslav partisans. After temporary division of Julian March by Morgan Line, Tolmin was part of Zone-B, which was under Yugoslav administrators. It was officially passed from Italy to Yugoslavia in 1947 after the Treaty of Paris. Finally Tolmin was passed to Slovenia after breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991. Main sights City square and museum Tolmin's main sights are its old town centre, a modern sports park, and thousand-year-old castle ruins at the hill known as Kozlov rob. The area is home to a multitude of vestiges from World War I. The most significant relic of the time is the Javorca Church, dedicated to the Holy Spirit built above the Polog shepherds outpost in the Tolminka Valley by Austro-Hungarian soldiers to commemorate their deceased comrades. The museum, library, schools, and the town‚Äôs open spaces provide venues for a variety of events, exhibitions, and presentations all year round. The Tolmin region is also a popular destination for artists from Slovenia and abroad. The parish church in the town is dedicated to the Assumption of Mary and belongs to the Diocese of Koper.Koper Diocese list of parishes and churches Tolmin is known for the \\"Metalcamp\\" festival since 2004, which since 2013 is called Metaldays, which every year attracts about 10,000 people from whole Europe and other parts of world.

Wood later established an independent solo career, and released her debut solo album Bite Your Tongue in 2006. Biography =Early life= Wood was born on 8 November 1977 in Newcastle, New South Wales. She developed an interest in performing from a young age and enrolled into jazz dancing classes where she would eventually also assist teaching younger students. At age 12, Wood's mother Judy encouraged her to take up singing by joining the Young Talent Time talent school. Her teachers quickly noticed her natural singing talent and at age 15, placed her into a show troupe \\"The Young Stars\\" which performed at various venues around New South Wales. During this three-year stint, Wood had her first experience of recording for an album and performing solo in front of large crowds, her biggest being the opening of the Sydney Harbour Tunnel where she performed in front of over 20,000 people. During her schooling years, she entered and won numerous talent quests and played the lead vocal role in her 1994 school musical Murder in the Music Hall. She completed her Higher School Certificate in 1995, her highest mark being eighty-five percent in music and at the age of 18, became the lead singer of a cover band \\"Quiver\\". They performed a wide range of songs including Tracy Chapman, Pearl Jam, Shania Twain, Alanis Morissette, 80's rock and more and Wood recorded original songs with the band. She then moved to Sydney, where she enrolled in the Australian Institute of Music choosing vocal as her major, which she completed successfully, and joined another cover band \\"The Anthill Mob\\". =Big break= In late 1999, at the age of 22, Wood auditioned for the first Australian series of Popstars, a reality television show which aimed to produce a new girl group. After selections for the group were finalised by the judges, she just missed out. However, after original member Chantelle Barry was forced out of the group in controversial circumstances, Wood was selected to replace her as the fifth member of the band, now known as Bardot. Popstars was one of the most popular, highest-rating television programs in Australia of 2000 and with the group's overwhelming exposure, Bardot's debut single \\"Poison\\" and self-titled debut album both entered at number one on the Australian ARIA charts, achieving multi-platinum sales. Further singles \\"I Should've Never Let You Go\\" and \\"These Days\\" continued the group's successful assault on the Australian charts and in August, Bardot embarked on its first national tour. Wood performed with her bandmates at the ARIA Music Awards of 2001 for which they were nominated in three categories. Promotional tours were made in numerous countries including Singapore, Taiwan, New Zealand, India and the United Kingdom. In 2001, Bardot returned to the spotlight with \\"ASAP\\", the first single from their second album. \\"ASAP\\" went Top 5 as did the following single \\"I Need Somebody\\". In November, Bardot released its second album Play It Like That, which achieved gold status upon release and performed before 90,000 music lovers at the Rumba festivals. In early 2002, they embarked on their second national tour and released their final single \\"Love Will Find a Way\\", before deciding to \\"call it a day\\" in April of that year. At the girl's final public concert, performed live at Channel [V], Wood broke into tears, sad at the realisation that it was all coming to an end. Later in interviews, she stated that she and former bandmate Belinda Chapple were the two members keen to continue as a group. =Solo career= Like former Bardot bandmate Sophie Monk, Wood signed a solo recording contract with Warner Music and changed her name from Tiffany Wood to Tiffani Wood in order to avoid confusion with the 1980s American popstar Tiffany. The debut single, \\"What R U Waiting 4\\" re- introduced Wood back into the music scene, marketed as an organic, light pop- rock singer (similar to the likes of Michelle Branch, Alanis Morissette etc.). The track debuted at No.27 on the ARIA singles chart on 22 March 2004 acharts Australia Singles Top 50 ‚Äì Monday 22 March 2004 and was one of the most-played songs on Australian radio in that month. Behind the scenes, however, tensions between Wood and Warner Music grew. Wood insisted that the second single be a self-penned track but Warner Music already planned on releasing someone else's song as the next single. After failing to reach a compromise, Wood made the decision to leave behind her recording contract for the option of artistic freedom and ultimate career control. In 2005, after leaving Warner Music, Wood decided to release her material independently and established her own record label Mudhoney Records. The first single \\"Devil in Your Soul\\" was released on 18 July and showcased a harder, fast-paced rock sound with electrical guitars, strong drum beats and a saucy vocal performance by Wood. The tongue-in-cheek lyrics, written by Wood and Richie Goncalves (who produced the song) took a stab at the music industry and how major record labels take advantage of their younger artists in order to make them 'marketable'. The single debuted at No.13 on the Association of Independent Records Labels (AIR) chart and spent numerous weeks in the top 20. In April 2006, Wood released her second independent single \\"Spin the Bottle\\" with a number of promotional commitments including a performance on the Seven Network's top-rating breakfast television program Sunrise. The song also featured in promotions for long-time Australian soap Neighbours in the lead up to the 2006 TV Week Logie Awards. The single was a success on the AIR charts, debuting in top 5 and eventually peaking at #2. Wood has established a strong reputation for her live performances, headlining shows at nightclubs and numerous events across the country. In 2006, she put together a burlesque-styled show, drawing inspiration from the 1940s and Dita Von Teese for her latest look and style of performance. In July 2006, Wood appeared in a nude photoshoot for nude-art magazine Black+White In September 2006, she released an up-beat cover of the Divinyls 1990 number one hit \\"I Touch Myself\\", receiving generally positive reviews. The single peaked at No.5 on the ARIA charts and was performed on the ARL Footy Show. Her debut solo album Bite Your Tongue was released in October 2006 and features a collection of self-penned rock-pop songs touching on issues such as body image, falling asleep behind the wheel and the entertainment industry. Respected music critic Cameron Adams gave the album three stars, crediting Wood for her \\"powerful voice\\" and describing the record as \\"sassy\\". In 2007, Tiffani Wood appeared in the stage musical Las Vegas Confidential ‚Äì The Musical. In 2009 she reunited with Katie Underwood in the stage show Valentino. =Personal life= In December 2005, Wood publicly announced her engagement to UK born bouncer Neil Cummins, and the couple married on 28 January 2007.Hens.com.au Photos from their wedding featured in OK! magazine. She later gave birth to their first child, Lillian Adel. The couple have since separated and were divorced in May 2009.

In Australasia, it is also known as a sushi train. Kaiten-zushi is a sushi restaurant where the plates with the sushi are placed on a rotating conveyor belt or moat that winds through the restaurant and moves past every table, counter and seat. Customers may place special orders. The final bill is based on the number and type of plates of the consumed sushi. Some restaurants use a fancier presentation such as miniature wooden \\"sushi boats\\" traveling small canals or miniature locomotive cars. Restaurants A conveyor belt sushi restaurant The distinguishing feature of conveyor belt sushi is the stream of plates winding through the restaurant. The selection is usually not limited to sushi; it may also include drinks, fruits, desserts, soups, and other foods. Some restaurants have RFID tags or other systems in place to remove sushi that has rotated for too long. =Special orders= If customers cannot find their desired sushi, they can make special orders. Sometimes speaker phones are available for this purpose above the conveyor belt. If a small quantity of sushi is ordered, it is placed on the conveyor belt but marked so other customers know that this dish was ordered by someone. Usually, the plate with the sushi sits on a labeled cylindrical stand to indicate that this is a special order. For large orders the sushi may also be brought to the customer by the attendants. Some restaurants in Japan also have touch screen displays for ordering specific dishes which might be delivered on a separate conveyor belt or by waiters. Condiments and tools are usually found near the seats, for example pickled ginger, chopsticks, soy sauce, and small dishes for the soy sauce. Wasabi may be either at the seat or on the conveyor belt. Self-served tea and ice water is usually complimentary, with cups stacked on a shelf above the conveyor belt and teabags or green tea powder in a storage container on the table. There is also a hot water faucet at the tables to make tea. On the shelves are usually wet paper towels and plastic boxes to store sushi for take-out customers. Customer's view at a conveyor belt sushi restaurant =Billing= The bill is calculated by counting the number and type of plates of the consumed sushi. Plates with different colors, patterns, or shapes have different prices, usually ranging from 100 yen to 500 yen. The cost of each plate is shown on signboards or posters in the restaurant. In general, cheap items come on plain plates, and the level of plate decoration is related to the price. The most expensive items tend to come on gold colored plates. Expensive items may be placed on two plates, with the price being the sum of the prices of the individual plates. Some conveyor belt sushi restaurant chains, such as Kappa Sushi or Otaru Zushi, have a fixed price of 100 yen for every plate. This is similar to the phenomenon of 100-yen shops. A button above the conveyor belt can be used to call the attendants to count the plates. Some restaurants have a counting machine where the customer drops the plates to be counted automatically, or they use RFID tagged plates and just count each stack at once with a special reader. =Conveyor operation= A sushi conveyor chain articulating around a tight corner Tsubaki frequently used in conveyor sushi restaurants The sushi conveyor consists of a thin, narrow conveyor designed to fit within the tight confines of a sushi restaurant. Virtually 100% of sushi conveyors made in Japan are manufactured in Ishikawa Prefecture.:ja:ÂõûËª¢ÂØøÂè∏#.E3.82.B3.E3.83.B3.E3.83.99.E3.82.A2 The standard conveyor uses a specially designed plastic crescent top chain. The chain actually runs on its side (on its link plates), with the crescent plate attached to the other side plate by means of a snap pin. This gives the chain a very small bending radius and allows the conveyor to make the tight corners found in most conveyor belt sushi restaurants. Further, the horizontal layout means that there is no return side of the chain, which not only eliminates chain sag and sliding with the roller, but allows for a much shallower design. Major chain companies can offer different pin materials (stainless steel being common), plate shapes, surface treatments, and so on depending on the individual application. Many customers are also turning to sushi conveyor manufacturers for custom designed plates to go with their conveyor. Innovations in sushi conveyors include chainless designs for quieter operation and design/layout freedom, multi-tiered conveyors to allow for more sushi to be displayed in limited spaces, and high speed lanes for custom orders. History A conveyor belt sushi restaurant in Portland's Pearl District Conveyor belt sushi was invented by Yoshiaki Shiraishi (1914‚Äì2001), who had problems staffing his small sushi restaurant and had difficulties managing the restaurant by himself. He got the idea of a conveyor belt sushi after watching beer bottles on a conveyor belt in an Asahi brewery. After five years of development, including the design of the conveyor belt and the speed of operations, Shiraishi opened the first conveyor belt sushi Mawaru Genroku Sushi in Higashiosaka in 1958, eventually expanding to up to 250 restaurants all over Japan. However, by 2001, his company had just 11 restaurants. Shiraishi also invented a robotic sushi, served by robots, but this idea has not had commercial success. Initially in a conveyor belt sushi restaurant, all customers were seated to face the conveyor belt, but this was not popular with groups. Subsequently, tables were added at right angles to the conveyor belt, allowing up to six people to sit at one table. This also reduced the length of conveyor belt needed to serve a certain number of people. A conveyor belt sushi boom started in 1970 after a conveyor belt sushi restaurant served sushi at the Osaka World Expo. Another boom started in 1980, when eating out became more popular, and finally in the late 1990s, when inexpensive restaurants became popular after the burst of the economic bubble. Recently, Akindo Sushiro became the most famous brand in 2010 in Japan. A new variant of conveyor belt sushi has a touch screen monitor at every table, showing a virtual aquarium with many fish. The customer can order the sushi by touching the type of fish, which is then brought to the table by conveyor belt.

Its online information centre and national support line provide information to over five million parents each year. History Breastfeeding an infant. The National Childbirth Trust, originally called The Natural Childbirth Trust, was founded in 1956 as the result of an advertisement placed in The Times by Prunella Briance. Briance suffered two traumatic childbirth experiences and set about changing the situation for other women, so that they should be more humanely treated during pregnancy and labour. Briance was inspired by the writings of British obstetrician Grantly Dick-Read, who is regarded by many as the father of natural childbirth, and became the first president of the NCT.http://www.pregnancytoday.com/reference/articles/grantly.htm Pregnancy Today At that time the rules of childbirth dictated that women did as their doctors told them. Briance's advertisement announced \\"A Natural Childbirth Association is to be formed for the promotion and better understanding of the Dick-Read system. Anyone interested write Box...\\". The inaugural meeting was held on 29 January 1957 at Caxton Hall with Grantly Dick-Read as one of the speakers. The NCA became the Natural Childbirth Trust in 1958\\"The NCT in the 20th century\\", National Childbirth Trust, December 16, 2004 and the National Childbirth Trust in 1961. =Key dates= * 1961 renamed the National Childbirth Trust, given charitable status.

About NCT The charity provides free antenatal and postnatal support and information through its nationwide network of over 300 local branches, run by volunteers. Many of these groups are informal drop-ins, such as ‚ÄòBumps and Babies‚Äô groups, where parents usually pay a small fee to cover the costs of tea and coffee. Baby Caf√©s, NCT‚Äôs free feeding drop-ins primarily based in deprived areas, were used by almost 8,000 women in the UK last year (2017), providing information and support about feeding. It also provided free of charge training for over 150 women to become breastfeeding peer supporters. NCT trains peer supporters across the UK to provide support to vulnerable new parents. For example, maternity champions on the Mozart Estate in London‚Äôs Queens Park; ‚ÄòParents in Mind‚Äô peer support projects to help mums with poor mental health; and a project in Leeds for refugee and asylum-seeking women. Criticism and reviews In January 2013, Kirstie Allsopp, presenter of property-related television shows, sparked press comment when she tweeted, \\"Lots of people have good NCT experiences, but many don't. This is a very politicised, dogmatic, and in my experience scary organisation.\\" There was further press criticism in the Daily Telegraph when the TV series In the Club, featuring an antenatal class, premiered.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-health/10992650/Antenatal- classes-mother-of-all-marvels-or-sheer-misery.html In April 2018, Alex Jones, TV presenter and host of BBC1‚Äôs The One Show, published a book, Winging It!, which includes a chapter on her NCT experience, \\"To NCT or not NCT\\".

Retrieved 14 January 2020. Construction The castle was sited on and near an earlier native fortification known as a cathair (stone fort), which gave its name to the place. The core structure of the castle dates to construction in the 13th century by the O'Brien family. The castle was built in two parts, with the side now by the street being built 200 years before the side now housing the audio-visual show. Granted to the powerful Butler family in late 14th century, the castle was enlarged and remodelled between the 15th and 17th centuries. It fell into ruin in the late 18th century and was partially restored in the 1840s. The Great Hall was partly rebuilt in 1840. History In 1375, the castle was granted to James Butler, newly created Earl of Ormond, for his loyalty to Edward III.Cahir Castle, discoverireland.ie. Retrieved 14 January 2020. His son James, the second Earl (by his second marriage) passed the lands around the barony of Iffa and Offa West to his children, though they were not themselves noble. This changed by 1542 when the first of the Barons Cahir was created. Unlike their Anglican kinsmen, this branch of the Butler dynasty sided with the Roman Catholic Irish in the Elizabethan wars. In 1599 the castle was captured after a three-day siege by the army of the Earl of Essex and was for a year put under the charge of Sir Charles Blount. Lord Cahir joined with the Earl of Tyrone in 1601 and was attainted for treason, but later obtained a full pardon. In 1627 the castle was the scene of a celebrated killing when Cahir's son-in-law, Lord Dunboyne, murdered his distant cousin, James Prendergast, in a dispute over an inheritance: he was tried for the killing but acquitted. During the Irish Confederate Wars the castle was besieged twice. In 1647 George Mathew, the guardian of the young Lord Cahir, surrendered to Murrough O'Brien, 6th Baron Inchiquin (later 1st Earl, and a descendant of Cahir's builder) following his victory at the Battle of Knocknanauss. In 1650 he surrendered again to Oliver Cromwell, during his conquest of Ireland without a shot even being fired.Cahir Castle, irishtourism.com. Retrieved 14 January 2020.

Its history dates from before the 8th century BC and it has substantial structures from the Etruscan, Roman, and Medieval periods.  History  Volterra, known to the ancient Etruscans as Velathri or Vlathri and to the Romans as Volaterrae, is a town and comune in the Tuscany region of Italy. The town was a Bronze Age settlement of the Proto-Villanovan culture, and an important Etruscan center (Vel√†thre, Velathri or Felathri in Etruscan, Volaterrae in Latin language), one of the \\"twelve cities\\" of the Etruscan League. The site is believed to have been continuously inhabited as a city since at least the end of the 8th century BC. It became a municipium allied to Rome at the end of the 3rd century BC. The city was a bishop's residence in the 5th century, and its episcopal power was affirmed during the 12th century. With the decline of the episcopate and the discovery of local alum deposits, Volterra became a place of interest of the Republic of Florence, whose forces conquered Volterra. Florentine rule was not always popular, and opposition occasionally broke into rebellion.https://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/volterra/background/history/a/nar/d5fb974e-c2e8-4bf7-9700-7ad9df2e9612/360054 These rebellions were put down by Florence. When the Republic of Florence fell in 1530, Volterra came under the control of the Medici family and later followed the history of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany.

Boryslav is designated as a city of oblast significance. It is a major center of petroleum industry. Population: . History The area of the modern town of Boryslav has been inhabited at least since the Bronze Age. There are remnants of a pagan shrine from the 1st millennium BC located in the area, where approximately 270 petroglyphs are found, mostly depicting solar signs ‚Äì symbols of a pre- Christian Solar deity. Between the 9th and 13th centuries, the site of the modern town housed a fortress named Tustan, which was part of a belt of similar strongholds defending the Kievan Rus' from the west and south. After the dissolution of Kievan Rus', the town became a part of the Halych-Volhynian Principality. With the collapse of the latter, in the 14th century Boryslav became a part of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland. It was first mentioned in a document from 19 March 1387, listing all personal belongings of Queen regnant Jadwiga of Poland. Since that time, Borys≈Çaw, as it was then called, was a small town related to the nearby metropolis of Lw√≥w (currently Lviv, Ukraine) and mostly shared its fate. In 1772, during the Partitions of Poland, it was annexed by Austria and became a part of the Austrian Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria. One of the great technological developments of the 19th century was the discovery by pharmacist Johan (Jan) Zeh (:uk:–ó–µ–≥ –Ø–Ω) (1817‚Äì1897, in nearby Lviv) of technology that led to the establishment of a new industry based on petroleum. Scientists worked out a method of distilling Boryslaw crude oil, and on 30 March 1853 made the first kerosene lamp. As early as 31 July 1853 their new lamp was used to illuminate the Public Hospital in Lviv. Their discoveries marked the beginnings of the rapid search for petroleum in the Carpathians ‚Äî especially in the eastern sector of the mountain chain where rich oil deposits were discovered. In 1854 the first ozokerite mine was started in the town after the ore was discovered by Robert Doms. In the second half of 1853, following the research of Jan Zeh, and several other scientists working in the nearby city of Lemberg (the then official name of Lviv), the town and its surroundings saw the emergence of an oil industry. One of the first oil rigs in the world was built near Boryslav by Robert Doms in 1861. The number of oil rigs also rose from 4,000 in 1870 to over 12,000 three years later. The oil boom drew many industry moguls from all over Austria-Hungary and many fortunes were earned and lost there. A period of prosperity saw the city's population grew as almost 10,000 new workers arrived to the area. In 1886 an oil mining school was opened in Borys≈Çaw, one of the first such facilities in Europe. Also the ozokerite, a natural mineral wax, mined in Borys≈Çaw, was used for insulation of the first trans-Atlantic telegraphic cable line. On 31 December 1872, a railway line linking Borys≈Çaw with the nearby city of Drohobycz (now Drohobych, Ukraine) was opened. In 1909, more than 1,920,000 tonnes of oil were produced in the region ‚Äî roughly 5% of the world's oil production at that time making the region the third biggest producer of oil after the US and the Russian Empire in the world.Oil extraction of the early 1910s in Boryslav, Western Ukraine (photographs of Boryslav from the 1910-1930s), The Ukrainian Week (16 April 2018) Oil wells in Borys≈Çaw After the Great War the area became part of the new West Ukrainian People's Republic. After the Polish-Ukrainian War of November 1918 ‚Äì July 1919 the area became part of the newly-reborn Poland. In 1920 the mining school was significantly expanded and was renamed to Carpathian Geological Station, a de facto oil mining university. As the capital of the Zag≈Çƒôbie Borys≈Çawskie (Borys≈Çaw Oil Basin), the town of Borys≈Çaw was the centre of then Polish oil and ozokerite extraction industries and one of the most important industrial zones of Poland. Because of that, on July 26, 1933, the town was granted a city charter. Together with the nearby settlement of Tustanowice (Tustanovychi, now part of Boryslav), Boryslaw produced in 1925 about 80% of Polish oil (812,000 tons). Boryslav was then commonly called the \\"Polish Baku\\". In the period 1929‚Äì1936, oil extraction shrank from 511,000 to 319,000 tonnes of oil annually. World War II German post stamp After the 1939 Soviet invasion of Poland, the town was annexed by the Soviet Union under the terms of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact. It was allocated to the Ukrainian SSR and renamed Boryslav. In 1941, the city fell under German control upon the advances of the German army to the east at the start of Soviet‚ÄìGerman hostilities. On the day following the Germans' arrival, local Ukrainians launched a pogrom, participated in by some German soldiers, that murdered approximately 350 Jews and wounded and robbed many more. The first official anti-Jewish actions began at the end of November 1941, when around 1,500 Jews, the majority of whom were deemed weak and unable to work, were shot by the Ukrainian militia and German security police in the forest near the town of Truskavets. During the winter of 1941‚Äì1942, many Jews died of hunger and disease, including typhus. In May 1942, an official ghetto was established; some Jews from neighboring towns were brought there to live. At the beginning of August 1942, Jews, including those from neighboring villages, like Pidbuzh and Skhidnytsya, were rounded up by the German police, Ukrainian Auxiliary Police, and Jewish police. Some were shot on the spot, about 400 were sent to the Janowska labor camp near Lwow, and 5000 were sent to Belzec where they were immediately gassed. During this Aktion, the manager of the German Karpathen oil company, Berthold Beitz, rescued about 250 children. Following this, two separate ghettos were created in Boryslav, including one for workers in the oil industry. In October 1942, the Germans and Ukrainians rounded up more than 1000 Jews and sent them to Belzec to be murdered. In another Aktion in November, about 1500 Jews were rounded up , held for three weeks under depraved conditions in a local cinema, and then sent to Belzec. Beitz again was able to rescue some children and help some adults escape across the Hungarian border. During the fifth aktion in February, 1943, 600 Jews were shot by members of the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police, German police, and the Schupo. The isolated executions of Jews in hiding took place all the time from May till June 1943 until the total liquidation of the Boryslav ghetto at the end of June 1943. Over the course of one week, the German forces murdered around 700 Jews (sick, young and elderly Jews and members of the Jewish Police). Other Jews were hunted down by Ukrainian and German forces and shot. The remaining Jews were deported to different labor camps (Plasz√≥w and Mauthausen) from April to June 1944. In all, over 10,000 Jews native to Boryslaw were shot by Germans and Ukrainians or murdered in the camps.http://yahadmap.org/#village/boryslav-boryslaw-lviv-ukraine.624 Some Jews escaped and formed partisan units in the forests. Resistance groups in the ghetto obtained some arms and set fire to some raw materials in ghetto industry. After the war, Berthold Beitz and several Polish and Ukrainian families held save Jews and were recognized as Righteous among the Nations by Yad Vashem. About 400 Boryslav Jews survived, of the 13,000 Jewish residents at the beginning of the war. For a description of the activities in Boryslav during the war, see the Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos. A personal-account history of this period is recounted by the Polish-American writer ‚Äî and Boryslav native ‚Äî Wilhelm Dichter in his popular and acclaimed literary debut, Ko≈Ñ Pana Boga. It is a memoir of the war in Borsylav as Dichter experienced it as a Polish-Jewish child. Following Germany's defeat in World War II, the town came again under the Soviet rule. Since 1991 the town has been part of an independent Ukraine. The oil industry remains operating. Experts believe that potential oil fields around Boryslav contain far more stocks.

The festival also features multiple all-night dance club parties, several fairs with medieval, gothic, and related merchandise, a variety of cultural exhibitions and performances, large themed picnics, and a number of unofficial fringe events. With 18,000 to 20,000 regular attendants, the WGT is one of the largest events of the gothic, cybergoth, steampunk, and rivethead subcultures worldwide.  History  A first attempt at a Treffen was made in 1987 in Potsdam. However, as the laws of the German Democratic Republic made this kind of event illegal, only a few hundred visitors attended. In 1991, after the re-unification of Germany, the first official Wave-Gotik-Treffen was held in the Eiskeller club (now Conne Island) in Leipzig. Since then, the number of visitors has increased greatly. Umbra et Imago music band performs at WGT, 2014 The largest installment of the WGT was the one in the year 2000 with over 300 acts and an estimated 25,000 visitors. However, that year's festival suffered financial collapse on the third day and had to be aborted. After all festival security guards, most bands and much of the technical staff had left, volunteer helpers and several bands who played for free staged a final concert. Contrary to police expectations, no rioting of any sort occurred. Events A major attraction of the Wave-Gotik-Treffen is the band performances. Generally, the number of musical acts is close to 200, spanning the breadth of \\"dark music\\" from acoustic folk to medieval- influenced to deathrock, to dark electro, EBM, symphonic metal, gothic metal, industrial. A limited number of free tickets are also available for those officially participating in the festival to attend opera performances, classical music concerts, theatre, and ballet. Participants at the Festival's Friday \\"Victorian\\" picnic. (2016) There's a shopping market in the main event venue that runs the entire duration of the festival and is perhaps the largest for the goth and \\"dark culture\\" community anywhere in the world. Several permanent shops in Leipzig also specialize in gothic-style clothing, shoes, and accessories, and can feature promotions during the event. Many museums in Leipzig such as the Egyptian Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts, and the Grassi Museums offer free admission or special guided tours for paid festival attendees. In addition, there are Renaissance fairs, Viking and Pagan markets, themed picnics, Gothic Romance events, CD/DVD and film premieres, literary readings, lectures and discussions, artist signing events, brunches celebrating absinthe, and fetishistic events. Later in the evenings there are many late-night danceclubs every night, with top-name dark music DJs, at venues such as Darkflower and Moritzbastei, as well as a dance area within the main venue itself. Many fringe events with separate admission take place in Leipzig simultaneously with Wave-Gotik-Treffen. There's an electronic music festival at NonTox, a \\"Gothic Pogo\\" festival, free events like Victorian and steampunk picnics and a \\"Victorian Village,\\" and more. Venues The venues for the Wave-Gotik-Treffen are spread out all over Leipzig. When validating their festival ticket, participants receive a wrist band which gives them entry to the event venues and entitles them to free usage of the city's public transportation, such as bus, tram, and local train, for the length of the festival. The main venue is the massive 10,000-person capacity Agra (de) fairground halls, 4.2 miles (6.75 km) south of central Leipzig. One of the two largest halls at the Agra is for the headline concerts, the other is for the main shopping market, and a third hall at the Agra houses a bistro area and a dance forum with many well-known DJs. In front of the Agra halls 1 and 2 is the \\"promenade\\" of the festival. The dozen-or-more additional venues for the WGT concerts and activities are as varied as the events, from the stately Schauspielhaus to the somber Krypta of the V√∂lkerschlachtdenkmal to the Parkb√ºhne under the trees. Festival participants typically stay either in designated camping areas on the Agra grounds near the main venue or in the hotels and hostels in and around Leipzig. In order to stay at camping areas, participants must pay extra for an Obsorgekarte, which gives them a version of the wrist band that allows campground access. Many food and drinks vendors set up stands in the \\"promenade\\" outside the Agra halls. Attendees with Obsorgekarte tickets/wristbands for camping may bring in their own food and drinks, which is otherwise restricted. Official drinks vendors use sturdy \\"Wave Gotik Treffen\\" branded plastic cups instead of disposable ones, for which a deposit (pfand) is required. Attendees may keep cups as souvenirs, or return them for a refund of the deposit. This arrangement greatly reduces the waste and needed cleanup of disposable containers around the venues. Dates The dates of the Wave-Gotik-Treffen vary from year to year. It is held on the German holiday weekend of , known in English as Pentecost or Whitsun. This is on the Sunday seven weeks after Easter and can range from as early as May 10 to as late as June 13 .

It stars Sylvester Stallone, Wesley Snipes, Sandra Bullock, and Nigel Hawthorne. Stallone is John Spartan, a risk- taking police officer, who has a reputation for causing destruction while carrying out his work. After a failed attempt to rescue hostages from evil crime lord Simon Phoenix, they are both sentenced to be cryogenically frozen in 1996. Phoenix is thawed for a parole hearing in 2032, but escapes. Society has changed and all crime has seemingly been eliminated. Unable to deal with a criminal as dangerous as Phoenix, the authorities awaken Spartan to help capture him again. The story makes allusions to many other works including Aldous Huxley's 1932 dystopian novel Brave New World, and H. G. Wells's The Sleeper Awakes. The film was released in the United States on October 8, 1993. It earned a worldwide total of $159 million, and was considered a successful film for Stallone.  Plot  In 1996, psychopathic career criminal Simon Phoenix kidnaps a busload of hostages and takes refuge in an abandoned building. LAPD Sergeant John Spartan runs a thermal scan of the building; finding no trace of the hostages, he leads an unauthorized assault to capture Phoenix. Phoenix sets off explosives to destroy the building; the hostages' corpses are later found in the rubble, and Phoenix claims Spartan knew about them and attacked anyway. Both men are sentenced to lengthy terms in the city's new \\"California Cryo-Penitentiary\\", a prison in which convicts are cryogenically frozen and exposed to subliminal rehabilitation techniques. In 2032, the city of San Angeles ‚Äì a megalopolis formed from the merger of Los Angeles, San Diego, and Santa Barbara ‚Äì is a peaceful utopia designed and run by Dr. Raymond Cocteau. Phoenix is thawed for a parole hearing and escapes from the cryo-prison by saying a secret password, without knowing how he had learned it. Since the police are no longer equipped to deal with any sort of violent crime, Lieutenant Lenina Huxley has Spartan thawed and reinstated to apprehend Phoenix again. Spartan finds life in San Angeles to be depressing and oppressive, since all types of behavior deemed immoral or unhealthy have been declared illegal; conversely, many other members of the police force view Spartan as savage and uncivilized. Anticipating that Phoenix will attempt to secure firearms, Spartan leads Huxley to a museum and finds him looting an exhibit of weapons. Phoenix escapes and holds Cocteau at gunpoint, but is unable to kill him. Cocteau had orchestrated Phoenix's escape, implanted a command to prevent Phoenix from killing him, and ordered him to kill Edgar Friendly, the leader of a resistance group called the Scraps who refuse to conform. Spartan and Huxley witness this exchange on security cameras and review the cryo-prison records, learning to their shock that Phoenix's rehabilitation program was designed to turn him into an extremely dangerous criminal and terrorist. Spartan and Huxley confront Friendly in the underground ruins where the Scraps live and save him from an assassination attempt by Phoenix and a gang of criminals thawed by Cocteau to assist him. Phoenix taunts Spartan with the revelation that he had framed Spartan for the deaths of the 1996 hostages, who were already dead when the building exploded. Phoenix escapes to the cryo-prison, and Spartan pursues him with weapons provided by the Scraps. Unable to harm Cocteau, Phoenix has one of his gang kill him instead and begins thawing out the cryo-prison's most dangerous convicts. Spartan incapacitates Huxley for her protection and fights Phoenix, breaking a vial of a cryogenic chemical that rapidly freezes Phoenix's body solid. Spartan kicks his head off, shattering it, and escapes as the uncontrolled quick-freezing effect triggers an explosion that destroys the cryo-prison. The police fear that the loss of Cocteau and the cryo-prison will end society as they know it, but Spartan suggests that they and the Scraps work together to combine the best aspects of order and personal freedom. He kisses Huxley and they leave together.  Cast   Production  = Development = The original script was written by Peter Lenkov, who retained a story by credit. Lenkov came to Hollywood straight out of college with no connections, and wrote seven different scripts, desperately hoping to break into Hollywood. Selling the spec script of Demolition Man to Warner Bros. was his first big break. Lenkov had been inspired by Lethal Weapon and wanted to do something about cops, and had also read about celebrities wanting to be cryogenically frozen. His initial pitch was rejected by an executive who didn't understand his \\"frozen cop\\" idea. The finished script, where a super cop has to battle the world's deadliest criminal, in a future where there is almost no crime, generated more interest. Writer Daniel Waters (known for Heathers) said his version of the screenplay was essentially a rewrite, he changed the script so extensively that when the script went to arbitration he received first screenplay writing credit. In the early drafts the script was a regular action movie, with no attempt at comedy. Waters pitched it as an action movie version of Woody Allen's Sleeper. Waters had an idea about a small part of Universal City, a shopping and entertainment area called CityWalk, and wondered what it might be like if one day all of Los Angeles might be like that, and the idea grew from there. Waters says his intention was to have fun, that he wasn't trying to be political or deeply examine Political correctness. He cited the conclusion of the film, where society will need to find a new balance and compromise, as representing his own position in the political middle ground. Burger King was originally written as the winner of the restaurant wars, but they and also McDonald's were not interested in being part of the film, but Taco Bell were happy to be involved. The \\"three seashells\\" concept originated when Waters was trying to come up with ideas for a futuristic restroom and called writer Larry Karaszewski for suggestions, and he happened to be using the restroom when he answered the call. He looked around his bathroom and said he had a bag of seashells on the toilet as decorations, so Waters decide to use that. Waters wrote some of the script on index cards while waiting in line for Johnny Carson tickets. He said it was some of the fastest work he'd ever written, and that he had only worked on it for two and a half weeks. The film began with John Spartan being taken out of cryogenic freeze in the future of 2032, until Fred Dekker did uncredited rewrites on the script, adding the Los Angeles 1996 prologue, to showcase Spartan and Phoenix in their natural environment, and make the differences of the future more striking. Dekker explained \\"If you don't show Kansas, Oz isn't all that special.\\" Jonathan Lemkin, also did uncredited rewrites on the film. The script had been in development for six years before filming finally began. Director Marco Brambilla had a background in shooting big-budget TV commercials, and this was his first feature film. Brambilla was working to make Richie Rich, starring Macaulay Culkin, but they couldn't get the budget they needed. Instead David Fincher recommended Brambilla to Joel Silver as director for Demolition Man. Steven Seagal had originally been attached as leading actor, and Jean-Claude Van Damme had been offered the part of the villain. Brambilla met Stallone a few days after getting attached to the project, and started re-writing the script with Daniel Waters. The film went into production approximately eight months after that. Producer Joel Silver was able to get highly experienced crew for the film, such as editor Stuart Baird and cinematographer Alex Thomson. Brambilla brought costumer Bob Ringwood to the project because of his work on David Lynch's Dune, and wanted Alex Thomson because of his work with Fincher on Alien3. = Casting = Stallone passed on the project at first, but came back around to it. He liked the idea of two equal opponents in Spartan and Phoenix, and decided to take a chance on doing something he had not done before. Stallone wanted Jackie Chan for the role of Simon Phoenix. Chan turned it down, not wanting to play a villain. Wesley Snipes turned down the role several times, so Joel Silver and Marco Brambilla went to the set of the film Rising Sun to try and convince him in person. Brambilla explained how he thought the film could be and his passion for the script they were writing, and the next day they received a call and Snipes agreed to do the film. Brambilla said of Snipes \\"he works without rehearsing too much, and he improvises a lot. The two of them, that combination of energies and the way they interact, really did the movie a lot of favors. They completely respected each other and were really professional, and they did get along. There was no ego or any competition between the actors.\\" Lori Petty was originally cast as Huxley, but was fired after two days of filming due to what producer Joel Silver described as \\"creative differences\\". Petty attributed it to personality differences, as she and Stallone did not get along, and said \\"Sly and I were like oil and water.\\" = Filming = General Motors provided the production team with 18 concept vehicles, including the Ultralite. More than 20 fiberglass replicas of the Ultralite were produced to portray civilian and SAPD patrol vehicles in the film. After filming had completed, the remaining Ultralites were returned to Michigan as part of GM's concept vehicle fleet. The film featured the actual demolition of one of the buildings of the no longer operative Belknap Hardware and Manufacturing Company in Louisville, Kentucky. The City of L.A. allowed the filmmakers to use and demolish an old Department of Water & Power building in downtown Los Angeles. This enabled them to have more control over the explosion, instead of having to cut straight to the building being gone and rubble as they had been forced to do with other projects. \\"We actually created a crater in the middle of the building. And have the explosion and rubble more designed, so to speak. It's fun to do that, because those big pyrotechnics always look great\\", Silver noted. The film suffered repeated delays, and the original 72-day production schedule ran to 112 days. Stallone was out for a week due to injury. Heavy rains in Los Angeles delayed filming. A soundstage was also damaged in a fire. The production went through five assistant directors, and many crew had to leave to work on other projects. Insiders at Warner Bros. were critical of Silver for hiring a director without previous feature film experience. Silver rejected this view, saying, \\"Marco's done a brilliant job. We're over-schedule because this is a very hard movie to make, not because Marco is inexperienced.\\" Demolition Man was the first production to film at the Los Angeles Convention Center after it was rebuilt in the 1990s, it was used as the Cocteau Center. \\"San Angeles\\" was filmed in Orange County, California. Several locations in Irvine were also used. The S.A.P.D. police station in the background was the GTE Corporate Headquarters in Westlake Village, California (which later became the Baxter Healthcare building, and was used in the first episode of The Orville). The Pacific Design Center, in West Hollywood was used for the exterior shot of Lenina Huxley's apartment building. The cryo-prison used the exterior of the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles. Filming also took place at Wilshire Courtyard, 5700 and 5750 Wilshire Boulevard. A power station in Eagle Rock, Los Angeles, was used as the underground dwellings of Edgar Friendly and the Scraps. The helicopter bungee jump at the start of the film was coordinated by Charles Picerni, and performed by stuntman Ken Bates. For safety, and due to the danger of recoil back into the helicopter blades, a decelerator was used instead of a real bungee, and Bates jumped 300 feet from a Chinook helicopter. According to Picerni it was a first: \\"We've done that off of buildings before, but never out of a helicopter.\\" The film mentions Arnold Schwarzenegger having served as President of the United States, after a Constitutional amendment was passed allowing him to run for the office due to his popularity. Coincidentally, a day short of ten years after the film's release, the California gubernatorial recall election was scheduled. The election saw Schwarzenegger actually begin a political career as the 38th Governor of California from 2003 until 2011. Shortly after he was elected, an \\"Arnold Amendment\\" did get proposed. One of the film's focal points is Taco Bell being the sole surviving restaurant chain after \\"the franchise wars.\\" The European version of the film substitutes Taco Bell with Pizza Hut, because Taco Bell is not as well known in outside the U.S.; both restaurant chains are owned by Yum! Brands. Lines were re-dubbed and logos changed during post- production. According to The Wall Street Journal, this kind of localization of product placement was a first. A subplot involving Spartan's daughter was cut for pacing reasons. This led to some confusion at test screenings, where audiences thought Sandra Bullock was the daughter, and reacted negatively to the scene where they were about to have sex. Originally Spartan's daughter was one of the Scraps living underground with Edgar Friendly's resistance. A scene where Stallone fights Jesse Ventura was cut from the film. The film had a production budget of $45 million, but sources told the Los Angeles Times that the cost increased to $77 million after the shooting schedule was extended from 72 to 112 days for the first unit of principal photography, plus an additional 75 days for work done by a second unit. The combined cost of production and marketing was estimated at nearly $97 million. =Plagiarism accusation= Hungarian science fiction writer Istv√°n Nemere says that most of Demolition Man is based on his novel Holtak harca (Fight of the Dead), published in 1986. In the novel, a terrorist and his enemy, a counter- terrorism soldier, are cryogenically frozen and awakened in the 22nd century to find violence has been purged from society. Nemere claimed that a copyright office committee judged that the film was a 75% match to the book. He did not file a lawsuit, as it would have been too expensive for him to hire a lawyer and fight against major Hollywood forces in the United States. He also claimed that Hollywood has plagiarized works of many Eastern European writers after the fall of the Iron Curtain, and that he knows the person he claims to be responsible for illegally selling his idea to the filmmakers.  Music  The title theme is a heavier remix of the song originally recorded by Grace Jones and written by Sting during his time as frontman for The Police. The song was first released in March 1981, as an advance single from Jones's fifth album, Nightclubbing. Sting released an EP featuring this song and other live tracks, entitled Demolition Man. Elliot Goldenthal composed the score for the film. It was his second big Hollywood project after the Alien¬≥ score.  Reception  = Box office = The film debuted at No. 1 at the box office. Demolition Man grossed $58,055,768 by the end of its box office run in North America and $159,055,768 worldwide. Film critic Roger Ebert was asked why this film was considered a success, but Last Action Hero was considered a flop, despite similar budgets and box office grosses. Ebert concluded it was due to expectations, and that the film was seen as a comeback for Stallone whose career had been flagging, whereas Schwarzenegger failed to live up to his previous record breaking successes. In 2017, Sylvester Stallone's loan-out company filed a lawsuit against Warner Bros. over the disbursement of profits from the film. The lawsuit was settled in 2019. = Critical response = On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 60% based on 42 reviews, with an average rating of 5.43/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"A better-than- average sci-fi shoot-em-up with a satirical undercurrent, Demolition Man is bolstered by strong performances by Sylvester Stallone, Wesley Snipes, and Sandra Bullock.\\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average scored a 34 out of 100, based on 9 reviews, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale. Siskel and Ebert At The Movies reviewed the film: Siskel found the film amusing but didn't care for the action sequences and gave it \\"thumbs down\\", whereas Ebert enjoyed both the satirical edge this film had over other films of this genre and thought the action sequences were good for this type of film, and gave it a \\"thumbs up\\". Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the film fails to give action fans what they desire, instead substituting out-of-place satirical commentary. Vincent Canby of The New York Times called it \\"a significant artifact of our time or, at least, of this week\\". Richard Schickel of Time wrote, \\"Some sharp social satire is almost undermined by excessive explosions and careless casting.\\" Subscription required archive: Peter Travers of Rolling Stone criticized the film calling it \\"sleek and empty as well as brutal and pointless.\\" Emanuel Levy of Variety called it \\"A noisy, soulless, self-conscious pastiche that mixes elements of sci-fi, action-adventure and romance, then pours on a layer of comedy replete with Hollywood in-jokes.\\" Levy says it \\"works better as a comic-book adventure than did \\"Last Action Hero\\", but reserves his praise for the technical merits of the film, complimenting \\"the high-tech, metallic look created by production designer David L. Snyder and his accomplished team\\" as well as the cinematography of Alex Thomson. He concludes \\"what's badly missing is a guiding intelligence to lift this disjointed pic from its derivative status.\\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave it a \\"B-\\". Despite his low expectations of a Joel Silver production and \\"the everything-goes-boom school of high-tech action overkill\\", he found it \\"an intermittently amusing sci-fi satire\\" before it switches to full-tilt destruction mode. Gleiberman says \\"if it's the promise of overwrought violence that lures people into theaters, I suspect it will be the quieter scenes‚Äîthe ones with a pretense of wit‚Äîthat keep them satisfied.\\" Hal Hinson of the Washington Post wrote: \\"Basically, Demolition Man is a futuristic cop picture with slightly more imagination and wit than the typical example of the slash-and-burn genre.\\" TV Guide praised the film and wrote: \\"The pleasant surprise about Demolition Man is that both the script, and Stallone, are funny; the film blends big-budget action and tongue-in-cheek humor in the way that 'Last Action Hero' tried, and failed, to do.\\" Phillipa Bloom of Empire magazine gave it 4 out of 5, and compared it to a one-night stand \\"not necessarily something you'll remember next day but fast, furious and damn good fun while it lasts.\\" Bloom was critical of the thin plot but called Stallone and Snipes \\"a dynamite screen combination\\". = Accolades = The film was nominated for three Saturn Awards, Best Costumes (Bob Ringwood), Best Special Effects (Michael J. McAlister, Kimberly Nelson LoCascio) and Best Science Fiction Film. The MTV Movie Awards nominated Wesley Snipes in the Best Villain category. Sandra Bullock was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award in the Worst Supporting Actress category.  Home media  Warner Bros. released it on VHS in March 1994, on DVD in October 1997 and 2014, and on Blu-ray in August 2011.  Adaptations  = Toys = The Oldsmobile 442 was used in the car chase and also included in the Hot Wheels toys from the film. Demolition Man action figures and vehicles were released in 1993. Produced by Mattel the toys were based on their \\"New Adventures of He-Man\\" style of figures. In addition to seven action figure, the set included a car, a red convertible called the \\"Fast Blast 442\\", an airplane \\"Bolajet\\" , and a \\"Missile Shooter\\" toy gun. Lenina Huxley was not included in the toy line. Hot Wheels released a set of 9 cars from Demolition Man. = Video games = Acclaim Entertainment and Virgin Interactive released Demolition Man on various home video game systems. The 16-bit versions were shooting games distributed by Acclaim. The 3DO version is a multi-genre game that incorporates Full Motion Video scenes, with both Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes reprising their roles as their characters in scenes that were filmed exclusively for the game. = Pinball = In April 1994, Williams released a widebody pinball machine, Demolition Man based on the film. It was designed by Dennis Nordman. The game features sound clips from the film, as well as original speech by Stallone and Snipes. = Comic books = A four-part limited-series comic adaptation was published by DC Comics starting in November 1993. = Novelization = A novelization, written by Robert Tine, was published in November 1993.  Legacy  Inspired by the film, Dennis Rodman had his hair dyed and styled the same way the character of Simon Phoenix played by Snipes, for his San Antonio Spurs debut, which was the start of Rodman dyeing his hair in different colors. Snipes hated this hairdo and shaved it off as soon as filming had wrapped. The development of erotic games for the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset has been compared to the \\"virtual sex\\" scene from the film. To celebrate the film's 25th anniversary, Taco Bell recreated the 2032 San Angeles version of their restaurant at the 2018 San Diego Comic-Con. The film has been described as a cultural touchpoint, and the restrictive future society has been used as an example of government overreach, and called a \\"Libertarian manifesto\\". Demolition Man has been referred to as \\"the only plausible dystopian vision for our time\\". The film found renewed relevance during the COVID-19 pandemic, the film was seen as predictive when there were calls to end the practice of shaking hands, and shortages of toilet paper.  Sequel  In 1993, US Magazine reported a sequel was planned for 1995. In 2006, Stallone was asked about a sequel and he said, \\"I'd like to make a sequel to DEMOLITION MAN, but I believe that ship has sailed and maybe there are more challenges waiting on the horizon.\\" On May 4, 2020, Stallone said a sequel is in development.

The Twelve Vows  The Twelve Vows of the Medicine Buddha upon attaining Enlightenment, according to the Medicine Buddha Sutra are: 1\\\\. I vow that my body shall shine as beams of brilliant light on this infinite and boundless world, showering on all beings, getting rid of their ignorance and worries with my teachings. May all beings be like me, with a perfect status and character, upright mind and soul, and finally attaining enlightenment like the Buddha. 2\\\\. I vow that my body be like crystal, pure and flawless, radiating rays of splendid light to every corner, brightening up and enlightening all beings with wisdom. With the blessings of compassion, may all beings strengthen their spiritual power and physical energy, so that they could fulfill their dreams on the right track. 3\\\\. I vow that I shall grant by means of boundless wisdom, all beings with the inexhaustible things that they require, and relieving them from all pains and guilt resulting from materialistic desires. Although clothing, food, accommodation and transport are essentials, it should be utilized wisely as well. Besides self- consumption, the remaining should be generously shared with the community so that all could live harmoniously together. 4\\\\. I vow to lead those who have gone astray back to the path of righteousness. Let them be corrected and returned to the Buddha way for enlightenment. 5\\\\. I vow that I shall enable all sentient beings to observe precepts for spiritual purity and moral conduct. Should there be any relapse or violation, they shall be guided by repentance. Provided they sincerely regret their wrong-doings, and vow for a change with constant prayers and strong faith in the Buddha, they could receive the rays of forgiveness, recover their lost moral and purity. 6\\\\. I vow that all beings who are physically disabled or sick in all aspects be blessed with good health, both physically and mentally. All who pay homage to Buddha faithfully will be blessed. 7\\\\. I vow to relieve all pain and poverty of the very sick and poor. The sick be cured, the helpless be helped, the poor be assisted. 8\\\\. I vow to help women who are undergoing sufferings and tortures and seeking for transformation into men. By hearing my name, paying homage and praying, their wishes would be granted and ultimately attain Buddhahood. 9\\\\. I vow to free all beings from evil thought and its control. I shall lead them onto the path of light through inculcating them with righteousness and honour so that they will walk the Buddha way. 10\\\\. I vow to save prisoners who have genuinely repented and victims of natural disasters. My supreme powers will bless those who are sincere and be freed from sufferings. 11\\\\. I vow to save those who suffer from starvation and those who committed a crime to obtain food.

There are several other mantras for the Medicine Buddha as well that are used in different schools of Vajrayana Buddhism. Iconography Bhai·π£ajyaguru is typically depicted seated, wearing the three robes of a Buddhist monk, holding a lapis-colored jar of medicine nectar in his left hand and the right hand resting on his right knee, holding the stem of the Aruna fruit or Myrobalan between thumb and forefinger. In the sutra, he is also described by his aura of lapis lazuli-colored light. In Chinese depictions, he is sometimes holding a pagoda, symbolising the ten thousand Buddhas of the three periods of time. He is also depicted standing on a Northern Wei stele from approximately 500 AD now housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, accompanied by his two attendants, Suryaprabha and Candraprabha. Within the halo are depicted the Seven Bhai·π£ajyaguru Buddhas and seven apsaras.S. C.

The Bhai·π£ajyaguruvai·∏ç≈´ryaprabhƒÅrƒÅja S≈´tra, which the Medicine Buddha is associated with and described in great detail in, is a common sutra to recite in Chinese temples as well. Furthermore, much like the nianfo path of Amitabha, the name of Medicine Buddha is also recited for the benefit of being reborn in the Eastern Pure Lands, though this is deemphasized in favor of the Medicine Buddha's role for the living. Role in Japanese Buddhism Yakushi (Bhaishajaguru, The Buddha of Healing) by Enk≈´ (1628-95). Brooklyn Museum. Starting in the 7th century in Japan, Yakushi was prayed to in the place of Ashuku (Akshobhya). Some of Yakushi's role has been taken over by Jiz≈ç (Ksitigarbha), but Yakushi is still invoked in the traditional memorial services for the dead. Older temples, those mostly found in the Tendai and Shingon sects, especially those around Kyoto, Nara and the Kinki region often have Yakushi as the center of devotion, unlike later Buddhist sects which focus on Amitabha Buddha or Kannon Bodhisattva almost exclusively. Often, when Yakushi is the center of devotion in a Buddhist temple, he is flanked by the , who were twelve yaksha generals who had been converted through hearing the Bhai·π£ajyaguruvai·∏ç≈´ryaprabhƒÅrƒÅja S≈´tra: Role in Tibetan Buddhism The practice of Medicine Buddha, the Supreme Healer (or Sangye Menla in Tibetan) is not only a very powerful method for healing and increasing healing powers both for oneself and others, but also for overcoming the inner sickness of attachment, hatred, and ignorance, thus to meditate on the Medicine Buddha can help decrease physical and mental illness and suffering. The Medicine Buddha mantra is held to be extremely powerful for healing of physical illnesses and purification of negative karma. One form of practice based on the Medicine Buddha is done when one is stricken by disease. The patient is to recite the long Medicine Buddha mantra 108 times over a glass of water. The water is now believed to be blessed by the power of the mantra and the blessing of the Medicine Buddha himself, and the patient is to drink the water. This practice is then repeated each day until the illness is cured.

The fanzine has been published monthly during the domestic football season since February 1989. The content of the fanzine is satirical - featuring jokes at the expense of Manchester United's own players in addition to their rival clubs. Launch The fanzine was launched at the end of the 1980s. At the time of the launch, Alex Ferguson had failed to deliver any silverware as team manager and the club were still in a run that would eventually last 26 years without winning England's top division league title. Other United fanzines, Red News (the first United fanzine) and United We Stand, both launched during the same era, and all three remain in circulation. Issue regulars The fanzine contains several regular contributions, starting with the editorial comments inside the front cover reflecting on recent United performances and news. Other regular features are: *The Word on the Street (known as Backbeat from 1995‚Äì2005): Snippets of gossip regarding United, the club's players, transfer rumours and the like. Collected by 'Woodward and Bernstein' via emails from private sources amongst both mag readers and football insiders, and also from the Red Issue forum's Sanctuary section, it's not unusual for a story to appear here before any tabloid newspapers pick up on it. *Life of Smiley: A play on the Lightning Seeds' track \\"The Life of Riley\\", a columnist's views on United, accompanied by happy or sad smiley faces depending on the subjects in question. *Mr. Spleen: Another regular column, usually far more critical of Manchester United and the teams' players than the editorial or Smiley. *Boylie: the views of Peter Boyle on all things related to Manchester United. *View from the Smoke: A regular column written by British journalist Mick Hume. The rest of the fanzine contains articles about past team exploits, contributions from readers and often comic strips which poke fun at United's rivals such as Manchester City (\\"Bertie Magoo - The Bitter Blue\\") and Liverpool (\\"Sticky Fingers\\") Campaigns Proclaiming to be the \\"Voice of the fans\\", Red Issue has tried to influence fan campaigns throughout its history - with notable contributions in the defeat of an attempted takeover of the club by Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB and attempts to block the Glazer takeover. Red Issue is also closely associated with the Manchester United Supporters' Trust (MUST), and regularly carries featured articles about the trust, encouraging fans to sign up with them. Green & Gold - Till They Die Or Fold/Till the club is sold is the current campaign by the Red Issue faithful led by forum leader Chatmaster. After Manchester United claimed an historic 19th League title, the Red Issue fanzine was behind the unveiling of a banner at arch-rivals Liverpool's home stadium Anfield, taunting opposition fans with their league titles record having been toppled. Availability The magazine can be purchased from sellers at both Manchester United home and away matches, and from branches of Aleef's Newsagents in Manchester City Centre, from sellers at breakaway club F.C. United of Manchester's home games at Gigg Lane, Bury. In addition, it is available on subscription from the fanzine's website. Website The Red Issue website ran in conjunction with the fanzine, containing links to the online forum. The website carried the same satirical tone to the fanzine itself, and advertised it on many pages. Rather than acting as a replacement for it, it acted as a more regular port of call for minor Manchester United related stories, usually with a short comment by the editor preceding them. Furthermore, it carried similar viewpoints to the magazine (such as a sarcastic love for the clich√©d word \\"massive\\" when used in aftermatch interviews.

About.com. Retrieved January 28, 2007. Teen pop incorporates different genres such as pop, R&B;, dance, electronic, hip hop, country, latin and rock. Typical characteristics of teen pop music include autotuned vocals, choreographed dancing, emphasis on visual appeal (photogenic faces, unique body physiques, immaculate hair styles and fashion clothes), lyrics focused on teenage issues such as love/relationships, finding oneself, friendships, teenage angst, teen rebellion, coming of age, fitting in and growing up (regardless of the artists' age) and repeated chorus lines. Teen pop singers often cultivate an image of a girl next door/boy next door. According to AllMusic, teen pop \\"is essentially dance-pop, pop, and urban ballads\\" that are marketed to teens, and was conceived in its contemporary form during the late 1980s and 1990s, pointing out the late 1990s as \\"arguably the style's golden era.\\" About.com's Bill Lamb described teen pop sound as \\"a simple, straightforward, ultra-catchy melody line [...] The songs may incorporate elements of other pop music genres, but usually they will never be mistaken for anything but mainstream pop. The music is designed for maximum focus on the performer and a direct appeal to listeners.\\" Some authors deemed teen pop music as \\"more disposable, less intellectually challenging, more feminine, simpler and more commercially focused than other musical forms.\\" In Music Scenes: Local, Translocal and Virtual, author Melanie Lowe wrote that teen pop \\"is marked by a clash of presumed innocence and overt sexuality, a conflict that mirrors the physical and emotional turmoil of its primary target audience and vital fan base: early-adolescent middle-and upper middle-class suburban girls.\\"Music Scenes: Local, Translocal and Virtual (2004)  History  = 20th century = Teen- oriented popular music had become common by the end of the swing era, in the late 1940s, with Frank Sinatra being an early teen idol.Pop Cult: Religion and Popular Music Till, Rupert (2010) However, it was the early 1960s that became known as the \\"golden age\\" for pop teen idols, who included Paul Anka, Frankie Avalon, Fabian, Lulu and Ricky Nelson. During the 1970s, one of the most popular preteen and teen-oriented acts was the Osmonds, where family members Donny and Marie both enjoyed individual success as well as success as a duo apart from the main family (Donny also recorded with his brothers as the Osmonds). Other successful singers and bands appealing to tweens and teens were Leif Garrett, Bobby Sherman, the DeFranco Family, David Cassidy and the Partridge Family, Shaun Cassidy, the Bay City Rollers and the Jackson 5 to name a few. The first major wave of teen pop after the counter-culture of the 1960s and 1970s occurred in the mid to late 1980s, with artists such as Menudo, New Edition, the Jets, Debbie Gibson, Tiffany, Martika, New Kids on the Block and Kylie Minogue. In the early 1990s, teen pop dominated the charts until grunge and gangsta rap crossed over into the mainstream in North America by late 1991. Teen pop remained popular in the United Kingdom with the boy band Take That during this period, until the mid-1990s when Britpop became the next major wave in the UK, eclipsing the style similar to how grunge did in North America.Teen Pop Music Genre Overview AllMusic Staff.

In their wake, other teen pop groups and singers rose to prominence, including Hanson, the Backstreet Boys, *NSYNC, Robyn, All Saints, S Club 7, Five, B*Witched, and Destiny's Child. In 1999, the success of teenaged pop singers Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Jessica Simpson, and Mandy Moore marked the development of what AllMusic refers to as the \\"pop Lolita\\" trend, sparking the short careers of upcoming pop singers such as Willa Ford, Brooke Allison, Samantha Mumba, Jamie-Lynn Sigler, Mikaila, Amanda, Nikki Cleary and Kaci Battaglia. In 2001, artists like Aaron Carter, Swedish group A-Teens, girl groups 3LW, Play, Eden's Crush and Dream and boy bands O-Town, B2K and Dream Street were teen pop artists who achieved success. Alternate \\"looks\\" for teen pop stars include Hoku, and girl group No Secrets, as well as the CCM group Jump5.

Many teen artists starting incorporating genres such as pop rock, contemporary R&B; and hip-hop. B2K, a hip hop/pop/R&B; group, consisting of four teenage black boys, so they were considered a boy band and was popular across the world, though they were only active from 2000 to 2004. Their style of music was very different than other teenage artists, sounding more mature than the typical boy band, though the members were all in their mid-teenage years as well. Other teenage black artists who sounded more mature in this way were Jhen√© Aiko and Mario. = 21st century = In the early and mid-2000s, teenage singers such as Michelle Branch, Avril Lavigne, Hilary Duff, Lindsay Lohan, Ashlee Simpson, JoJo, Aly & AJ, Jesse McCartney, Rihanna, Skye Sweetnam, Hope Partlow, Jordan Pruitt, Fefe Dobson, Taylor Swift, Stacie Orrico, Cheyenne Kimball, Bow Wow, Ciara, Lumidee, Paula DeAnda, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Tisdale, Raven-Symon√©, Corbin Bleu and Chris Brown achieved success, indicating new relevance of teen-oriented pop music. Since the late 2000s, many teen stars had developed careers through their involvement with Disney (although some had done so many years before). Alongside Disney, other teen pop stars emerged by 2007; among them American Idol winner Jordin Sparks, David Archuleta, and Nickelodeon stars Miranda Cosgrove, Victoria Justice, Keke Palmer and Ariana Grande. Miley Cyrus, Selena Gomez, the Jonas Brothers, and Demi Lovato are some examples of teen pop singers whose careers started on the Disney Channel. The introduction of Canadian singer Justin Bieber, a prot√©g√© of Usher, created a resurgence of interest in teen pop, especially of the traditional male teen idol. At the time of his debut album's release, Bieber set records as the only four songs in to the top forty of the Billboard Hot 100, the first artist to send all songs from an album in the Billboard Hot 100. This created a wave of new teen artists found on social media, notably Shawn Mendes and Charlie Puth. One Direction, 5 Seconds of Summer, Little Mix and Fifth Harmony have also re-introduced teen groups, mostly thanks to hit singing competition shows such as The X Factor. In 2005, AKB48 was created to promote idol culture and Japanese pop nationwide and overseas followed by the expansion of sister groups and rival groups locally and internationally over the years. In 2016, SNH48, as AKB48's second international sister group, announced its local Chinese sister groups like BEJ48, GNZ48, SHY48 and CKG48 to integrate idol culture with a Chinese twist. In 2010, the creation of Ark Music Factory helped contributed a new generation of teen pop artists via the internet, such as Rebecca Black and Jenna Rose, despite major criticism with these artists due to the excessive use of auto-tune. As for Japanese teen pop culture, the category of \\"idol\\" is playing an important role. Momoiro Clover Z is ranked as number one among female idol groups according to 2013‚Äì2017 surveys.

Gameplay  Equipped with one construction unit, a Vibz-type starship, and a small amount of credits, players start out in a guarded star system (\\"Imperial system\\") to eventually create their own empire. Typical first steps in Mankind consist of building a small base on one of the nearby planets and mining available resources which could either be sold or used to construct further units. Later, a player can leave the safety of the Imperial systems behind and colonize his own star system. = Environments = Planet surfaces as well as the space in star systems are realized as separate two- dimensional square game maps, called \\"environments\\" in game jargon. While space maps have borders, planetary maps are virtually borderless - units leaving the map at the eastern border reappear in the west, those leaving in the north reappear in the south. Each environment can contain player units and installations. Some restrictions exist, such as land vehicles only being able to operate on planetary maps, or specific starships not being able to enter planetary environments. Only one environment per player can be active at a time. Players can switch between maps by loading the unit content of a new environment, thereby leaving the old one. = Game universe = The game takes place in the so-called \\"Mankind galaxy\\". The galactic map available for navigation is divided into sectors of space (\\"cubes\\" in game jargon), each of which might contain between zero and about 25 stars. Each star system contains between 5 and 8 planets. Early game reviews talked about a total sum of 900 million available planets, each with their own climate, seasons and population, a figure that was repeated in advertising text on the game box and even topped by the official website, which claimed several million systems and billions of planets. In fact, a majority of these planets and star systems were unavailable (\\"closed\\") at the initial release of the game and have never been opened afterwards. During the two game resets since its release, the layout of the Mankind galaxy was changed and its size reduced. The last released galaxy consists of 73,251 star systems with 476,265 planets. The persistent universe feature means that even when players are not involved in the game their mines extract ore, factories create equipment, ships continue commerce, and combat units continue to do battle. The game also has option to allow the user be notified via cell phone text message if their units came under attack. Development Mankind was initially published in December 1998 by the French computer game developer Vibes Online Gaming. After the transfer of Vibes to its Asian partner, the game was bought by O2 Online Entertainment Ltd., it is being primarily maintained by Quantex since 2008. Estimates of the number of active players are hard to come by - while the official site claimed both 145,000 and \\"more than 200,000\\" players on the same page, these figures likely included inactive as well as trial accounts. According to an interview with an O2OE spokesman, barely 3,000 accounts were active in May 2003. During the game rework of Quantex in early 2009, the graphic engine of Mankind was fully ported to DirectX 9 and full support for Windows Vista implemented. Further, dozens of small improvements were implemented. In December 2015 the Mankind servers were shut down.https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1188853037795398&id;=119527944727918 A newer version of the game, which is based on the original Mankind, is in the works.

He studied physics at Justus-Liebig-Universit√§t in Giessen and Leopold-Franzens- Universit√§t Innsbruck and completed his studies with a Ph.D. at the University of Giessen, Germany, in 1971. In 1976, he moved to the department of nuclear chemistry at GSI in Darmstadt, Germany, which was headed by Peter Armbruster. He played a leading role in the construction of SHIP, the 'Separator of Heavy Ion Reaction Products'. He was the driving force in the discovery of the cold heavy ion fusion and the discovery of the elements bohrium (Z = 107), hassium (Z = 108), meitnerium (Z = 109), darmstadtium (Z = 110), roentgenium (Z = 111), and copernicium (Z = 112). In 1984, he became head of the new GSI project, the fragment separator, a project which opened new research topics, such as interactions of relativistic heavy ions with matter, production and separation of exotic nuclear beams and structure of exotic nuclei. He directed the Nuclear Structure and Nuclear Chemistry department of the GSI and was professor of physics at the University of Mainz until he retired in March 2005. Gottfried M√ºnzenberg was born into a family of Protestant ministers (father Pastor Heinz and mother Helene M√ºnzenberg). All his life he has been deeply concerned about the philosophical and theological implications of physics. Among the rewards he received should be mentioned the R√∂ntgen-Prize of the University of Giessen in 1983 and (together with Sigurd Hofmann) the Otto-Hahn-Prize of the city of Frankfurt/Main in 1996.

The scripture supported by the padma (lotus) held in his left hand is a Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ s≈´tra, representing his attainment of ultimate realization from the blossoming of wisdom. Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´ is often depicted as riding on a blue lion or sitting on the skin of a lion. This represents the use of wisdom to tame the mind, which is compared to riding or subduing a ferocious lion. In Chinese and Japanese Buddhist art, Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´'s sword is sometimes replaced with a ruyi scepter, especially in representations of his Vimalakirti Sutra discussion with the layman Vimalakirti.Davidson, J. LeRoy, \\"The Origin and Early Use of the Ju-i\\", Artibus Asiae 1950,13.4, 240. According to Berthold Laufer, the first Chinese representation of a ruyi was in an 8th-century Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´ painting by Wu Daozi, showing it held in his right hand taking the place of the usual sword. In subsequent Chinese and Japanese paintings of Buddhas, a ruyi was occasionally represented as a Padma with a long stem curved like a ruyi.Laufer, Berthold, Jade, a Study in Chinese Archaeology and Religion, Field Museum of Natural History, 1912, 339. He is one of the Four Great Bodhisattvas of Chinese Buddhism, the other three being K·π£itigarbha, Avalokite≈õvara, and Samantabhadra. In China, he is often paired with Samantabhadra. In Tibetan Buddhism, Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´ is sometimes depicted in a trinity with Avalokite≈õvara and VajrapƒÅ·πái. Mantras A mantra commonly associated with Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´ is the following:Buswell, Robert. Lopez, Donald. The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism. 2013. p. 527 :o·πÉ arapacana dhƒ´·∏• The Arapacana is a syllabary consisting of forty-two letters, and is named after the first five letters: a, ra, pa, ca, na.Buswell, Robert. Lopez, Donald. The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism. 2013. p. 61 This syllabary was most widely used for the GƒÅndhƒÅrƒ´ language with the Kharo·π£·π≠hƒ´ script but also appears in some Sanskrit texts. The syllabary features in MahƒÅyƒÅna texts such as the longer Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ texts, the Ga·πá·∏çavy≈´ha S≈´tra, the Lalitavistara S≈´tra, the Avata·πÉsaka S≈´tra, the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, and the M≈´lasarvƒÅstivƒÅda Vinaya. In some of these texts, the Arapacana syllabary serves as a mnemonic for important MahƒÅyƒÅna concepts. Due to its association with him, Arapacana may even serve as an alternate name for Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´. The Sutra on Perfect Wisdom (Conze 1975) defines the significance of each syllable thus: # A is a door to the insight that all dharmas are unproduced from the very beginning (ƒÅdya- anutpannatvƒÅd). # RA is a door to the insight that all dharmas are without dirt (rajas). # PA is a door to the insight that all dharmas have been expounded in the ultimate sense (paramƒÅrtha). # CA is a door to the insight that the decrease (cyavana) or rebirth of any dharma cannot be apprehended, because all dharmas do not decrease, nor are they reborn. # NA is a door to the insight that the names (i.e. nƒÅma) of all dharmas have vanished; the essential nature behind names cannot be gained or lost. Tibetan pronunciation is slightly different and so the Tibetan characters read: ' (). \\\\- Visible Mantra's website In Tibetan tradition, this mantra is believed to enhance wisdom and improve one's skills in debating, memory, writing, and other literary abilities. \\"\\" is the seed syllable of the mantra and is chanted with greater emphasis and also repeated a number of times as a decrescendo. In Buddhist cultures A painting of the Buddhist manjusri from the Yulin Caves of Gansu, China, from the Tangut-led Western Xia dynasty =In China= Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´ is known in China as Wenshu (). Mount Wutai in Shanxi, one of the four Sacred Mountains of China, is considered by Chinese Buddhists to be his bodhima·πá·∏ça. He was said to bestow spectacular visionary experiences to those on selected mountain peaks and caves there. In Mount Wutai's Foguang Temple, the Manjusri Hall to the right of its main hall was recognized to have been built in 1137 during the Jin dynasty. The hall was thoroughly studied, mapped and first photographed by early twentieth-century Chinese architects Liang Sicheng and Lin Huiyin.Liang, Ssucheng. A Pictorial History of Chinese Architecture. Ed. Wilma Fairbank. Cambridge, Michigan: The MIT Press, 1984. These made it a popular place of pilgrimage, but patriarchs including Linji Yixuan and Yunmen Wenyan declared the mountain off limits.*See Robert M. Gimello, \\"Chang Shang-ying on Wu-t'ai Shan\\", in Pilgrims and Sacred Sites in China:, ed. Susan Naquin and Ch√ºn-fang Y√º (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1992), pp. 89‚Äì149; and Steven Heine, \\"Visions, Divisions, Revisions: The Encounter Between Iconoclasm and Supernaturalism in K≈çan Cases about Mount Wu-t'ai\\", in The K≈çan, pp. 137‚Äì167. Mount Wutai was also associated with the East Mountain Teaching. Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´ has been associated with Mount Wutai since ancient times. Paul Williams writes:Williams, Paul. Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations. 2000. p. 227 According to official histories from the Qing dynasty, Nurhaci, a military leader of the Jurchens of Northeast China and founder of what became the Qing dynasty, named his tribe after Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´ as the Manchus. The true origin of the name Manchu is disputed. Monk Hanshan (ÂØíÂ±±) is widely considered to be a metaphorical manifestation of Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´. He is known for having co-written the following famous poem about reincarnation with monk Shide: Drumming your grandpa in the shrine, Cooking your aunts in the pot, Marrying your grandma in the past, Should I laugh or not?

YamƒÅntaka (meaning 'terminator of Yama i.e. Death') is the wrathful manifestation of Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´, popular within the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism. Other variations upon his traditional form as Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´ include Namasangiti, Arapacana Manjushri, etc. In Tibetan Buddhism, Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´ is also a yidam. =In Nepal= According to Swayambhu Purana, the Kathmandu Valley was once a lake. It is believed that Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´ came on a pilgrimage from his earthly abode-Wutaishan(five-peaked mountain) in China. He saw a lotus flower in the center of the lake, which emitted brilliant radiance. He cut a gorge at Chovar with his flaming sword to allow the lake to drain. The place where the lotus flower settled became the great Swayambhunath Stupa and the valley thus became habitable. =In Indonesia= In eighth century Java during the Medang Kingdom, Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´ was a prominent deity revered by the Sailendra dynasty, patrons of Mahayana Buddhism. The Kelurak inscription (782) and Manjusrigrha inscription (792) mentioned about the construction of a grand Prasada named VajrƒÅsana Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´g·πõha (Vajra House of Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´) identified today as Sewu temple, located just 800 meters north of the Prambanan. Sewu is the second largest Buddhist temple in Central Java after Borobudur. The depiction of Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´ in Sailendra art is similar to those of the Pala Empire style of Nalanda, Bihar. Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´ was portrayed as a youthful handsome man with the palm of his hands tattooed with the image of a flower. His right hand is facing down with an open palm while his left-hand holds an utpala (blue lotus). He also uses the necklace made of tiger canine teeth. In other traditions In Hindu tradition, Majushri has been depicted as emanation of Shiva.

Its name is a reference to Manjusri. The reactor has been inoperative for most of the time since it was originally built. It was last operated in 2010 and is now definitely closed. Monju was a sodium cooled, MOX-fueled, loop-type reactor with three primary coolant loops, designed to produce 280 MWe from 714 MWt. It had a breeding ratio of approximately 1.2. The plant is located on a site that spans 1.08 km2 (267 acres), the buildings occupy 28,678 m2 (7 acres), and it has 104,680 m2 of floor space.  History Construction started in 1986 and the reactor achieved criticality for the first time in April 1994. An accident in December 1995, in which a sodium leak caused a major fire, forced a shutdown. A subsequent scandal involving a cover-up of the scope of the accident delayed its restart until May 6, 2010, with renewed criticality reached on May 8, 2010. In August 2010 another accident, involving dropped machinery, shut down the reactor again. As of June 2011, the reactor has only generated electricity for one hour since its first testing two decades prior. As of the end of 2010, total funds spent on the reactor amounted to ¬•1.08 trillion. An estimated ¬•160‚Äì170 billion would be needed to continue to operate the reactor for another 10 years.Kyodo News, \\"Monju costs far surpass usual nukes\\", Japan Times, 4 July 2012, p. 3 As of 2014, the plant had cost ¬•1 trillion ($9.8 billion). A final decision on the project (e.g. to decommission or extend funding) was due by end 2016, and a decision to close the facility was made in December 2016. In December 2017 the Japan Atomic Energy Agency applied for approval of its decommissioning plan by the Nuclear Regulation Authority. Decommissioning and dismantling are planned to be completed by 2047 and is expected to cost ¬•375 billion. Detailed history =1995 sodium leak and fire= On December 8, 1995, the reactor suffered a serious accident. Intense vibration caused a thermowell inside a pipe carrying sodium coolant to break, possibly at a defective weld point, allowing several hundred kilograms of sodium to leak out onto the floor below the pipe. Upon contact with air, the liquid sodium reacted with oxygen and moisture in the air, filling the room with caustic fumes and producing temperatures of several hundred degrees Celsius. The heat was so intense that it warped several steel structures in the room. An alarm sounded around 7:30 p.m., switching the system over to manual operations, but a full operational shutdown was not ordered until around 9:00 p.m., after the fumes were detected. When investigators located the source of the spill they found as much as three tons of solidified sodium. The leak occurred in the plant's secondary cooling system, so the sodium was not radioactive. However, there was massive public outrage in Japan when it was revealed that Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation (PNC), the semigovernmental agency then in charge of Monju, had tried to cover up the extent of the accident and resulting damage. This coverup included falsifying reports and the editing of a videotape taken immediately after the accident, as well as issuing a gag order that aimed to stop employees revealing that tapes had been edited.wise-paris.org Sodium Leak and Fire at Monju =2010 Restart= Monju in 2007 On November 24, 2000, Japan Atomic Energy Agency announced their intention to restart the Monju reactor. This decision was met with resistance by the public, resulting in a series of court battles. On January 27, 2003, the Nagoya High Court's Kanazawa branch made a ruling reversing its earlier 1983 approval to build the reactor, but then on May 30, 2005, Japan's Supreme Court gave the green light to reopen the Monju reactor. The nuclear fuel was replaced for the restart. The original fuel loaded was mixed plutonium-uranium oxide with plutonium content of around 15‚Äì20%, but by 2009, due to natural radioactive decay, the fuel had only half of the original plutonium-241 content. This made achieving criticality impossible, requiring fuel replacement. The restart was scheduled for October 2008, having been moved back five months.World Nuclear News. Monju enters extended testing. Aug 31, 2007. A restart date of February 2009 was again delayed due to the discovery of holes in the reactor's auxiliary building; in August 2009 it was announced that restart might be in February 2010.Reuters. Japan fast-breeder reactor may restart in Feb. Aug 12, 2009. In February 2010, JAEA obtained official approval to restart the reactor from the Japanese Government. The restart was definitely scheduled for the end of March.The Yomiuri Online. Monju reactor clears hurdle to restart. Feb 23, 2010. In late February, JAEA requested Fukui Prefecture and Tsuruga City for deliberations aimed at resuming test operation. Having obtained the go ahead from both entities, JAEA started criticality testing, after which it took some months before commercial operation could resume ‚Äì as for any new nuclear plant.The Denki Shinbun. First step toward resuming test operation of Monju. Feb 26, 2010. Operators started withdrawing control rods on May 6, 2010, marking the restart of the plant. The Fukui Prefecture governor, Issei Nishikawa asked the METI for additional stimulus to the prefecture including an expansion of the Shinkansen in turn for the restart of the plant. Monju achieved criticality on May 8, at 10:36 AM JST. Test runs were to continue until 2013, at which point the reactor could have started to feed power into the electric grid, beginning \\"full fledged\\" operation. =2010 \\"In‚ÄêVessel Transfer Machine\\" falling accident= On August 26, 2010, a 3.3-tonne \\"In‚ÄêVessel Transfer Machine\\" fell into the reactor vessel when being removed after a scheduled fuel replacement operation.

The JAEA began preparatory engineering work on May 24, 2011 to set up equipment to be used to retrieve the IVTM that fell inside the vessel. The fallen device was successfully retrieved from the reactor vessel on June 23, 2011.Fallen device retrieved from Japan fast-breeder reactor June 23, 2011. =2012 Sodium-heater failure= On Sunday 2 June 2012 the sodium heater, which keeps the sodium molten as a secondary coolant, ceased operating for half an hour from about 4:30 p.m. The power supply was checked, but insufficient information in the service manual, caused the heater to stop, causing a fall of about 40 C from 200 C of the sodium temperature. Under the internal rules of JAEA, the failure was regarded a too minor incident to report it to the authorities, but the next day the Nuclear Regulation Authority and local governments were informed about the incident. However it was not made public.The Mainichi Shimbun (08 June 2013) Monju reactor's sodium heater temporarily halted by error =2013 New Director of the JAEA appointed= On 31 May 2013 science and technology minister Hakubun Shimomura announced that Shojiro Matsuura, (77 years) the former chairman of the Nuclear Safety Commission, would be the next president of JAEA on Monday 3 June. In this function he would reorganize the JAEA, with safety as a top priority.

Again in 2015 it was discovered that regular degradation assessments measuring the thickness of sodium cooling pipes had not been carried out since 2007. =Further incidents= On 16 February 2012 NISA reported that a sodium-detector malfunctioned. About 3 p.m local time the alarm went off. Additionally, a ventilator that should cool a pipe stopped. According to NISA no leakage was found, and there was no damage to the environment. Repairs were planned.The Mainichi Daily News (17 February 2012)Monju fast breeder reactor's sodium detector hits trouble On 30 April 2013 an operating error rendered two of the three emergency generators unusable. During the monthly testing of the emergency diesel generators, staff forgot to close six of the twelve valves they had opened before testing, releasing thick black smoke. JAERI reported it to the Nuclear Regulation Authority as a breach of security regulations.Japan Today (2 May 2013) Black smoke detected from Monju reactor during test operations On Monday 16 September 2013 before 3 a.m. the data transmission of the reactor stopped to the government's Emergency Response Support System. Whether this was caused by Typhoon Man-yi, the powerful typhoon that went through Japan that day, was unknown. At that moment it was not possible to restore the connection, because the reactor site in Tsuruga was inaccessible due to mudslides and fallen trees caused by the typhoon.The Mainichi Shimbun (16 September 2013) Data transmission from Monju reactor stopped On August 3, 2016, it was discovered that an alert triggered on November 19, 2015, when the quality of the water in a spent nuclear fuel rod pool deteriorated, was ignored until April 2016 and rectified only the next month.The Mainichi Shimbun (3 August 2016) „ÇÇ„Çì„Åò„ÇÖ Ë¶èÂÆöÈÅïÂèç Ê∞¥Ë≥™ÊÇ™Âåñ„ÅÆË≠¶Â†±„ÄÅÂçäÂπ¥ÈñìÊîæÁΩÆ Developments since Fukushima-Daiichi accident in March 2011 In September 2011 the ministry of education, science and technology asked for the fiscal year of 2012 only 20 to 30 percent of the budget to maintain and manage the Monju reactor for the year 2011. The uncertainty about Japan's future energy policy caused the ministry to conclude that the project could not proceed.JAIF (26 September 2011) Earth-quake-report 217: Japan to freeze fast-breeder reactor project The test run of the reactor, in which the reactor's output would be raised to 40 percent of its capacity by the end of March 2012, was postponed on September 29, 2011, by the Japanese Government because the uncertainty over the future of nuclear energy. After the disaster in Fukushima, the Atomic Energy Commission of Japan made a start with a review of Japan's long term energy policy. An outline of this policy would be published within 12 months. On September 30, officials of the Science and Technology ministry explained their decision not to start the test run at meetings in the city of Tsuruga and Fukui Prefecture.JAIF(September 29, 2011)Earthquake-report 219: Japan to postpone test to restart Monju reactor The local Fukui edition of the Asahi Shinbun reported on June 22, 2012 that the reactor would restart in July 2012.Asahi Shinbun Fukui local edition (July 4 2012) After it was revealed in November 2012, that regular safety checks had been omitted, the Nuclear Regulation Authority ordered JAEA to change its maintenance rules and inspection plans. JAEA had failed to perform periodical safety checks on nearly 10,000 out of 39,000 pieces of equipment at the plant before the deadlines were met. Half May 2013 not all details were worked out, and under the rules set by the NRA, it was not allowed to change nuclear fuel rods or move the control rods. Therefore, the restart of the reactor was not permitted.The Mainichi Shimbun (13 May 2013) Nuclear authority not to allow restart of Monju reactor On 16 May 2013 the NRA ordered JAEA President Atsuyuki Suzuki to comply with their decisions and planned a meeting on 23 May to explain their reasoning, making it very likely that the NRA would block the reactivation of the reactor. In reaction to this Suzuki told reporters, \\"It takes nearly one year for preparation and it is physically quite difficult (to restart the reactor before March 2013).\\" The Mainichi Shimbun(17 May 2013)Monju reactor unlikely to resume operations by next March: JAEA Because the criticism of the NRA on the sloppy safety controls Atsuyuki Suzuki resigned as President of JAEC on 17 May. Although the resignation was accepted by the government, the move was a surprise, because on May 16 Susuki had spoken on a meeting in the Japanese parliament, the Diet, and to the NRA secretariat and had pleaded to restore the public's trust in the JAEC. The NRA commented, that Suzuki's resignation had not solved fundamental problems and that there was a need to restructure the JAEA as an organization. Suzuki (born 1942) was an authority on the nuclear fuel cycle, and became President of the JAEA in August 2010. Before this he was a professor at the University of Tokyo and the chairman of the former Nuclear Safety Commission. Yonezo Tsujikura, vice president of the JAEA, served as acting president until a successor was chosen.The Mainichi Shimbun (17 May 2013) Head of operator of trouble-plagued fast-breeder reactor resigns At the end of the fiscal year 2011, a budget of was requested to continue the Monju project. This money would cover the costs of maintenance and the costs of the test run, planned in the summer of 2012. On 20 November a seven-member Japanese government commission decided that the future of the Monju reactor should be thoroughly reviewed before a decision could be made for this 2012 budget. Some members of the commission thought that there would be little public support for restarting the fast breeder project, and that it was uncertain that the reactor could be taken into commercial service in 2050 as originally planned. Other members said that the Monju project should be stopped completely, and that all efforts should be put into the international fusion reactor project ITER instead. Decisions about the 2012 budget would be taken after the discussions in a panel of cabinet members about the nuclear policy of Japan, including the fast breeder reactor project, would be complete.NHK-world (20 November 2011) Govt panel seeks to revise nuclear projects Reports in 2012 indicated that plans to generate electricity at Monju would be abandoned, and the plant repurposed into a research centre for handling spent nuclear fuel. On 29 May 2013, the NRA announced that JAEA was prohibited from restarting the fast breeder reactor, describing the safety culture at the plant as \\"deteriorated\\", because the problems at the plant were not addressed, and the staff were aware of the delayed inspections. The NRA said that before it could plan a restart of the reactor, JAEA must allocate appropriate funds and human resources to rebuild a maintenance and management system to prevent the recurrence of coolant leakages and other problems. The NRA also announced that an assessment would be made of whether geologic faults at the location of the Monju facility are active. It had similar plans for surveys at six facilities all over Japan. On 2 March 2015 Noboru Hirose, a senior NRA official, told NHK at the beginning of a 3-week regular safety check that he could not say when test runs would be permitted to start. He would first need to examine how safety checks are conducted and whether adequate measures are in place to avoid a repeat of earlier problems. JAEA had hoped the ban would be lifted by the end of March 2015. Seismic research in 2011, 2012 and 2013 On 5 March 2012 a group of seismic researchers revealed the possibility of a 7.4M (or even more potent) earthquake under the Tsuruga Nuclear Powerplant. Before this date the Japanese governmental Earthquake Research Committee and Japan Atomic Power had calculated that the Urasoko fault under the plant, combined with other faults connected to it, was around 25 km long. and could cause a 7.2M quake and a 1.7 meter displacement. On top of this, the presence of the oceanic faults were not taken into account by NISA and JAP in the assessment of the safety of the Tsuruga nuclear power plant. Analysis of sonic survey and other data provided by Japan Atomic Power analysed by a panel of experts of Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency showed the presence of multiple faults existing within 2 to 3 km from the Urasoko fault. According to Sugiyama, a member of this group of scientists, these faults were highly likely to be activated together, and this would extend the length of the Urasoko fault to 35 km. Computer simulations calculating the length of a fault based on its displacement, showed the Urasoko fault to be 39 km long, a result close to the length estimated by the sonic survey data, and the fault could cause some 5 meter displacement when activated together with other faults. Yuichi Sugiyama, the leader of this research group of the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, warned that ‚Äì as other faults on the south side of the Urasoko fault could become activated together ‚Äì \\"The worst case scenario should be taken into consideration\\" According to the experts there were many other faults located under one reactor on the west side of the Urasoku fault that could move also simultaneously. If this would be confirmed, the location of the Tsuruga nuclear plant would be disqualified.The Mainichi Shimbun (5 March 2012)Fault under Tsuruga nuclear plant could trigger M7.4 quake: research On 6 March 2012 NISA asked Japan Atomic Power Co. to reassess the worst-case scenario for earthquakes at the Tsuruga Nuclear Power Plant. What damage this could do to the buildings on the site, because the Urazoko fault, running around 250 meters from the reactor buildings, could have a serious impact on the earthquake resistance of the power plant. NISA was also planning to send similar instructions to two other nuclear power plant operators in the Fukui area: Kansai Electric Power Company, and Japan Atomic Energy Agency. Because the Mihama Nuclear Power Plant and the Monju fast breeder reactor could also be affected by a possible earthquake caused by the Urazoko fault.The Mainichi Shimbun (7 March 2012) Quake severity estimate for Tsuruga nuclear plant to be reassessed On 17 July 2013 a commission of five experts led by NRA commissioner Kunihiko Shimazaki started the investigations on the geological activity of 8 zones of crushed rock under the reactor. Whether these old faults could move in conjunction with the active fault situated half a kilometer from the reactor site, and would constitute a hazard for the reactor safety. One of the experts, Chiba University professor Takahiro Miyauchi,The Mainichi Shimbun (19 July 2013) Govt's nuclear fuel cycle policy teeters on edge as onsite Monju inspection completed did not take part in the two-day survey, but would visit the site afterwards.The MainichiShimbun (17 July 2013) Panel starts investigation on geologic faults at Monju reactor site On Thursday 18 July Kunihiko Shimazaki told reporters, that his team could not yet reach a conclusion, further research was needed. Another acoustic survey of the grounds was planned by Japan Atomic Energy Agency and a geological examination to determine the age of the clay and stones in the faults. This could take a couple of months to finish, The assessment was planned at the end of August 2013.The Mainichi Shimbun (19 July 2013) Conclusion on faults under Monju reactor will take time: survey team Decommissioning plans On 21 October 2011 the Japanese government appointed a commission to study ways to cut wasteful expenditures, one possibility being decommissioning the Monju prototype fast breeder reactor. The Government Revitalization Unit took up this issue, because the calls to abolish this reactor were growing after the nuclear accident at Fukushima. As the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant made it difficult, if not impossible, to build new nuclear power plants, the government panel would also review subsidies for localities with atomic power plants as well as functions of related entities such as the Japan Atomic Energy Agency.Mainichi Japan (22 October 2011) Gov't cost-cutting unit to study Monju reactor's abolition On 27 November, after a visit to the plant, nuclear disaster minister Goshi Hosono said that scrapping the Monju-fast- breeder reactor was an option that would be given serious thought. Politicians and private sector experts of the ruling Democratic Party of Japan made proposals for a thorough operational and budgetary review in the government's energy policy screening session earlier in the week before his visit.The Mainichi Daily News (28 November 2011) Gov't to consider scrapping of Monju reactor as option: Hosono On 21 December 2016, the Japanese government confirmed the closure and decommissiong of the Monju reactor, with the suggestion that this would cost at least ¬•375 billion. The decommissioning of Monju is planned to take 30 years. The Japanese regulator, the Nuclear Regulation Authority, accepted the plan in March 2018. The phases of the plan are: #transfer spent fuel to on-site storage pool by 2022 #liquid sodium coolant extracted #equipment dismantled #reactor building demolished and removed by 2047 Other FBR programs in Japan Despite its intention to close the Monju facility, the Cabinet appeared to reaffirm its commitment to a fast breeder program of some kind, essential if Japan's stockpile of some 50 tonnes of plutonium is to be disposed of. J≈çy≈ç is a test fast breeder reactor located in ≈åarai, Ibaraki. The reactor was built in the 1970s for the purpose of experimental tests and the development of FBR technologies. The successor to Monju was expected to be a larger demonstration plant to be completed around 2025, built by the newly formed Mitsubishi FBR Systems company. However, in 2014 Japan agreed to cooperate in developing the emergency reactor cooling system, and in a few other areas, with the French ASTRID demonstration sodium- cooled fast breeder reactor. As of 2016, France was seeking the full involvement of Japan in the ASTRID development.

The building sits on approximately , is long and is surrounded by four city streets. It is at 9 Nicholson Street in the Carlton Gardens, flanked by Victoria, Carlton and Rathdowne Streets, at the north- eastern edge of the central business district. It was built to host the Melbourne International Exhibition in 1880‚Äì81, and then hosted the even larger Centennial International Exhibition in 1888, and the formal opening of the first Parliament of Australia in 1901. The building is representative of the money and pride Victoria had in the 1870s. Throughout the 20th century smaller sections and wings of the building were subject to demolition and fire; however, the main building, known as the Great Hall, survived. It received restoration throughout the 1990s and in 2004 became the first building in Australia to be awarded UNESCO World Heritage status, being one of the last remaining major 19th-century exhibition buildings in the world. It is the world's most complete surviving site from the International Exhibition movement 1851‚Äì1914. It sits adjacent to the Melbourne Museum and is the largest item in Museum Victoria's collection. Today, the building hosts various exhibitions and other events and is closely tied with events at the Melbourne Museum. History Aerial view of the Carlton Gardens, where the building is. Lithograph of the building in 1880. Note the rear wings which no longer exist. The Big Picture, opening of the Parliament of Australia, 9 May 1901, by Tom Roberts Carlton Gardens The Royal Exhibition Building was designed by the architect Joseph Reed of Reed and Barnes architecture, who also designed the Melbourne Town Hall, the State Library of Victoria, and the Baroque style gardens. The Royal Exhibition Building was the largest design completed by Reed and Barnes. According to Reed, the eclectic design was inspired by many sources. Composed of brick, timber, steel, and slate, the Exhibition Building is representative of the Byzantine, Romanesque, Lombardic and Italian Renaissance styles. The dome was modeled on the Florence Cathedral, while the main pavilions were influenced by the style of Rundbogenstil and several buildings from Normandy, Caen and Paris. The building has the scale of the French Beaux Arts, with a cruciform plan in the shape of a Latin cross, with long nave-like wings symmetrically placed east‚Äìwest about the central dome, and a shorter wing to the north. The Great Hall is still in beautiful condition, crowned by an octagonal drum and dome rising 68 metres, and 18.3 metres across. The dome was formed using cast iron and timber frame and has a double shell. At the crossing, windows in the drum of the dome bring in sunlight for a bright open space. The interior is painted in the colour scheme of 1901, with murals and the words \\"Victoria Welcomes All Nations\\" under the dome surviving from 1888. In 1888, electric lighting was installed for the Centennial International Exhibition, making it one of the first in the world that was accessible during night time. The interior decorations changed between the two exhibitions of 1880 and 1888. In 1880 the walls were left bare and windows and door joinery colored green. In 1888, walls were painted for the first time. The decoration was by interior designer John Ross Anderson. It was built by David Mitchell, who also built Scots' Church and St Patrick's Cathedral. He was also the father of the famed soprano Dame Nellie Melba, who sang at the opening of the Provisional Parliament House in Canberra in 1927. Mitchell was a member of the Council of the Royal Agricultural society and also the Builders and Contractor's association. The foundation stone was laid by Victorian governor George Bowen on 19 February 1879The Age and it was completed in just 18 months, opening on October 1, 1880, as the Melbourne International Exhibition. The building consisted of a Great Hall of over 12,000 square metres, flanking lower annexes to the north on the east and west sides, and many temporary galleries between. =1880‚Äì1901= In the 1880s, the building hosted two major International Exhibitions: The Melbourne International Exhibition in 1880 and the Melbourne Centennial Exhibition in 1888, celebrating a century of European settlement in Australia. The most significant event to occur in the Exhibition Building was the opening of the first Parliament of Australia on 9 May 1901, following the inauguration of the Commonwealth of Australia on 1 January. After the official opening, the Federal Parliament moved to the Victorian State Parliament House, while the Victorian Parliament moved to the Exhibition Building for the next 26 years. On 3 September 1901, the Countess of Hopetoun, wife of the Governor- General, announced the winners of a competition to design the Australian National Flag. A large flag, 5.5 metres by 11 metres, was unfurled and flown over the dome of the Royal Exhibition Building.It's an Honour =1901‚Äì1979= The building from the pool In 1902, the building hosted the Australian Federal International Exhibition.

The wing of the building which once housed Melbourne Aquarium burnt down in 1953. It was a venue for the 1956 Summer Olympics, hosting the basketball, weightlifting, wrestling, and the fencing part of the modern pentathlon competitions.1956 Summer Olympics official report. p. 43. During the 1940s and 1950s, the building remained a venue for regular weekly dances. Over some decades of this period it also held boat shows, car shows and other regular home and building industry shows. It was also used during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s for State High School Matriculation and for the Victorian Certificate of Education examinations, among its various other purposes. The western annexe was demolished in the 1970s. The last remaining original annex, the grand ballroom, was demolished amid controversy in 1979. It was replaced with a new building on the same footprint providing more exhibition space, clad in mirror glass, in 1980. On 1 October 1980 during a visit to Victoria, Princess Alexandra unveiled a plaque which commemorated both the opening of the new mirror-glass \\"Centennial Hall\\", and the centenary of the building. She also unveiled a second plaque commemorating the bestowal of the title \\"Royal\\" on the building by Her Majesty the Queen. =1980‚Äìpresent= Following the outcry over the ballroom demolition, and the appointment of new Trustees and a new Chair in 1983, the heritage of the building began to be seen as important as providing modern space for exhibitions. The first conservation assessment of the building was undertaken by Alan Willingham in 1987, and over the following decades the Great hall was progressively renovated and restored.\\"Global status for our greatest building\\", 21 October 2002. URL accessed on 5 September 2006. In 1996, the then Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett, proposed the location and construction of Melbourne's State Museum in the carpark to the north, which involved the demolition of the 1960s annexes in 1997‚Äì98. Melbourne Royal Exhibition Building (east side) The main hall inside the building The location of the Melbourne Museum close to the Exhibition Building site was strongly opposed by the Victorian State Labor Party, the Melbourne City Council and some in the local community. Due to the community campaign opposing the museum development, John Brumby, then State opposition leader, with the support of the Melbourne City Council, proposed the nomination of the Royal Exhibition Building for world heritage listing. The world heritage nomination did not progress until the election of the Victorian State Labor Party as the new government in 1999. On 1 July 2004, the Royal Exhibition Building and Carlton Gardens was granted listing as a World Heritage Site, the first building in Australia to be granted this status. The heritage listing states that \\"The Royal Exhibition Building is the only major extant nineteenth-century exhibition building in Australia.

Most timber staircases have been replaced by concrete for safety also. The site has continued to be very authentic through all renovations though. All additions have been removes such as the East and West annexes and the two North structures. The Australian Government has recently granted $20 million for further renovation to protect and promote the Royal Exhibition Building. The South faces will include conservation world, the dome of the Great Hall will be repaired and will create a new experience. The basement will be turned into a curatorial exhibition experience. This will be a place where history is brought to life, and ideas of the future are expanded upon. The Australian Department of Environment and Energy, along with Heritage Victoria, Creative Victoria and Museums Victoria will oversee the projects. The renovations are predicted to be finished by 2020. Current use The Royal Exhibition Building is still in use as a commercial exhibition venue, hosting many events on a regular basis such as the Melbourne International Flower and Garden Show. Regular tours are also offered by Melbourne Museum. The Royal Exhibition Building is used as an exam hall for the University of Melbourne, Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, Melbourne High School, Nossal High School, Mac.Robertson Girls' High School and Suzanne Cory High School. The building is no longer Melbourne's largest commercial exhibition centre. The modern alternative is the Melbourne Exhibition and Convention Centre, which is in Southbank to the south of the Melbourne central business district.

Kane also co-created the animated series Cool McCool. He was inducted into the comic book industry's Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1994 and into the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 1996. Early life and work Robert Kahn was born in New York City, New York. His parents, Augusta and Herman Kahn, an engraver, were of Eastern European Jewish descent. A high school friend of fellow cartoonist and future Spirit creator Will Eisner, Robert Kahn graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School and then legally changed his name to Robert Kane. He studied art at Cooper Union before \\"joining the Max Fleischer Studio as a trainee animator in the year of 1934\\".Chris Ryall, Scott Tipton, Comic Books 101: The History, Methods and Madness (Impact Books, 2009). Comics He entered the comics field two years later, in 1936, freelancing original material to editor Jerry Iger's comic book Wow, What A Magazine!, including his first pencil and ink work on the serial Hiram Hick. The following year, Kane began to work at Iger's subsequent studio, Eisner & Iger, which was one of the first comic book \\"packagers\\" that produced comics on demand for publishers entering the new medium during its late-1930s and 1940s Golden Age. Among his work there was the funny animal feature \\"Peter Pupp\\" ‚Äî which belied its look with overtones of \\"mystery and menace\\" ‚Äî published in the U.K. comic magazine Wags and reprinted in Fiction House's Jumbo Comics. Kane also produced work through Eisner & Iger for two of the companies that would later merge to form DC Comics, including the humor features \\"Ginger Snap\\" in More Fun Comics, \\"Oscar the Gumshoe\\" for Detective Comics, and \\"Professor Doolittle\\" for Adventure Comics. For that last title he went on to do his first adventure strip, \\"Rusty and his Pals\\". =Batman= Detective Comics #27 (May 1939). The first appearance of Batman. Art by Bob Kane. In early 1939, DC's success with the seminal superhero Superman in Action Comics prompted editors to scramble for more such heroes. In response, Bob Kane conceived \\"the Bat-Man.\\" Kane said his influences for the character included actor Douglas Fairbanks' film portrayal of the swashbuckler Zorro; Leonardo da Vinci's diagram of the ornithopter, a flying machine with huge bat-like wings; and the 1930 film The Bat Whispers, based on Mary Rinehart's mystery novel The Circular Staircase (1908).Daniels, page 20 Bill Finger joined Bob Kane's nascent studio in 1938. An aspiring writer and part-time shoe salesperson, he had met Kane at a party, and Kane later offered him a job ghost writing the strips Rusty and Clip Carson. He recalled that Kane Finger said he offered such suggestions as giving the character a cowl and scalloped cape instead of wings; adding gloves; leaving the mask's eyeholes blank to connote mystery; and removing the bright red sections of the original costume, suggesting instead a gray-and-black color scheme. Finger additionally saidFinger in Kane, Andrae, p. 41 his suggestions were influenced by Lee Falk's The Phantom, a syndicated newspaper comic strip character with which Kane was familiar as well. Finger, who said he also devised the character's civilian name, Bruce Wayne, wrote the first Batman story, while Kane provided art. Kane, who had already submitted the proposal for Batman at DC and held a contract, is the only person given an official company credit for Batman's creation. Comics historian Ron Goulart, in Comic Book Encyclopedia, refers to Batman as the \\"creation of artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger\\". According to Kane, \\"Bill Finger was a contributing force on Batman right from the beginning. He wrote most of the great stories and was influential in setting the style and genre other writers would emulate ... I made Batman a superhero-vigilante when I first created him. Bill turned him into a scientific detective.Kane, Andrae, p. 43 The character debuted in Detective Comics #27 (May 1939) and proved a breakout hit. Within a year, Kane hired art assistants Jerry Robinson (initially as an inker) and George Roussos (backgrounds artist and letterer). Though Robinson and Roussos worked out of Kane's art studio in The New York Times building, Kane himself did all his drawing at home. Shortly afterward, when DC wanted more Batman stories than Kane's studio could deliver, the company assigned Dick Sprang and other in- house pencilers as \\"ghost artists\\", drawing uncredited under Kane's supervision. Future Justice League writer Gardner Fox wrote some early scripts, including the two-part story \\"The Monk\\" that introduced some of The Batman's first \\"Bat-\\" equipment.Kane, Andrae, p. 103; Daniels, page 29 In 1943, Kane left the Batman comic books to focus on penciling the daily Batman newspaper comic strip. DC Comics artists ghosting the comic-book stories now included Jack Burnley and Win Mortimer, with Robinson moving up as penciler and Fred Ray contributing some covers. After the strip finished in 1946, Kane returned to the comic books but, unknown to DC, had hired his own personal ghosts, including Lew SchwartzLew Schwartz interview, Alter Ego #51 (Aug. 2005) and Sheldon Moldoff from 1953-1967.Moldoff, in a 1994 interview given while Kane was alive, described his clandestine arrangement in Alter Ego #59 (June 2006, p. 15) =Robin= Bill Finger recalled that, Kane, who had previously created a sidekick for Peter Pupp, proposed adding a boy named Mercury who would have worn a \\"super-costume\\".Comic Book Interview Super Special: Batman, Fictioneer Press, 1989 Robinson suggested a normal human, along with the name \\"Robin\\", after Robin Hood books he had read during boyhood, and noting in a 2005 interview he had been inspired by one book's N. C. Wyeth illustrations. The new character, an orphaned circus performer named Dick Grayson, came to live with Bruce Wayne as his young ward in Detective Comics #38 (April 1940) and would inspire many similar sidekicks throughout the Golden Age of comic books. =The Joker= Batman's nemesis the Joker was introduced near that same time, in Batman #1 (Spring 1940). Credit for that character's creation is disputed. Kane's position is that Robinson, whose original Joker playing card was on public display in the exhibition \\"Masters of American Comics\\" at the Jewish Museum in New York City, New York, from September 16, 2006 to January 28, 2007, and the William Breman Jewish Heritage Museum in Atlanta, Georgia from October 24, 2004 to August 28, 2005, has countered that: Robinson added, however, \\"If you read the Batman historian [E. Nelson] Bridwell, he had one interview where he interviewed Bill Finger and he said no, the Joker was created by me ‚Äî an acknowledgement. He can be credited and Bob himself, we all played a role in it. ... He wrote the script of that, so he really was co-creator, and Bob and I did the visuals, so Bob was also.\\"Jerry Robinson in =Other characters= According to comics historian Les Daniels, \\"nearly everyone seems to agree that Two-Face was Kane's brainchild exclusively\\".Daniels, Les, Batman: The Complete History, Chronicle Books, 1999, p. 45. Catwoman, originally introduced by Kane with no costume as \\"the Cat\\", was partially inspired by his cousin, Ruth Steel.Kane, Andrae, p. ??? Kane, a frequent moviegoer, mentioned that Jean Harlow was a model for the design and added that \\"I always felt that women were feline\\".Daniels, Les, Batman: The Complete History, Chronicle Books, 1999, p. 42. Kane created the Scarecrow and drew his first appearance, which was scripted by Finger.Daniels, Les, Batman: The Complete History, Chronicle Books, 1999, p. 55. Kane also created the original incarnation of Clayface. According to Kane, he drew the Penguin after being inspired by the then advertising mascot of Kool cigarettes ‚Äî a penguin with a top hat and cane. Finger, however, claimed that he created the villain as a caricature of the aristocratic type, because \\"stuffy English gentlemen\\" reminded him of emperor penguins.  Later life and career  Grave of Bob Kane, at Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills In 1966, Kane retired from DC Comics, choosing to focus on fine art. As Kane's comic-book work tapered off in the 1960s, he parlayed his Batman status into minor celebrity. He enjoyed a post-comics career in television animation, creating the characters Courageous Cat and Cool McCool, and as a painter showed his work in art galleries, although some of these paintings were produced by ghost artists. DC Comics named Kane in 1985 as one of the honorees in the company's 50th anniversary publication Fifty Who Made DC Great. In 1989, Kane published the autobiography Batman and Me, with an updated edition Batman and Me, The Saga Continues, in 1996. Kane worked as a consultant on the 1989 film Batman and its three sequels with directors Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher. Stan Lee interviewed Kane in the documentary series The Comic Book Greats.

Hermitage is a French wine Appellation d'Origine Contr√¥l√©e (AOC) in the northern Rh√¥ne wine region of France south of Lyon. It produces mostly red wine from the Syrah grape; however, small quantities of white wine are also produced from Roussane and Marsanne grapes. The hill is seen by some as the spiritual home of the Syrah grape variety.http://www.jancisrobinson.com/articles/the-hermitage-conundrum  History  According to legend, the Knight Gaspard de St√©rimberg returned home wounded in 1224 from the Albigensian Crusade and was given permission by the Queen of France to build a small refuge to recover in, where he remained living as a hermit (ermite in French). The chapel on top was built in honor of Saint Christopher and today is owned by the negociant Paul Jaboulet √Çin√©. Louis XIII made the wine a wine of the court after being offered a glass during a visit to the region in 1642. Louis XIV presented King Charles II of England with 200 casks of fine wine including examples from Hermitage, Champagne and Burgundy. The Romanovs also imported the wine. In the 19th century, wines from Bordeaux were often \\"hermitaged\\" (hermitag√©, that is, blended with Hermitage) and could fetch higher prices as a result. The appellation was established in its modern form in 1937.  Geography  The appellation fans out from the town of Tain l'Hermitage. The vines grow on the south west side of a steep granite hill facing the afternoon sun and can be divided into a number of smaller vineyards. These are \\"Les Bessards\\" to the west, \\"L'Hermite and \\"La Chapelle on the top of the mountain, and \\"Bessards\\", \\"Le M√©al\\", \\"Les Greffieux\\", and \\"Murets\\" to the east. With of vines, in soil composed greatly of granite and gravels, Hermitage produces 730,000 bottles of mostly red wines, annually.  Grape Varieties  Production of red wines dominate, but white wines are also produced. In this case a white Hermitage from Chapoutier from 100% Marsanne. Syrah is the primary red grape of Hermitage, mostly used on its own although the appellation rules do allow the addition of 15% or less of Marsanne and/or Roussanne grapes. Hermitage reds tend toward being very earthy, with aromas of leather, red berries, earth, and cocoa/coffee. Because of the high levels of tannin they are usually aged longer than American or Australian Syrahs and are often cellared up to 40 years. Rich, dry white wines are also produced from a blend of Marsanne and Roussanne. These wines are also usually left to age, for up to 15 years. Vin de paille or Straw Wine is also produced in this region.  Notable Producers  The most notable producer of Hermitage is Domaine Jean-Louis Chave, whose estate can trace its origins back to 1481.

History Flaxmans Hill, from Peterborough within the Bay of Islands Coastal Park Aboriginal peoples occupied the area for thousands of years before European settlement. The town was believed to have been founded when the schooner SS Schomberg was wrecked in the middle of the 19th century, though the town was not sufficiently populated to justify a post office until 10 April 1890. It has since become a fishing and holiday village. There are two public tennis courts and beaches, and a nine-hole golf course at the Peterborough Golf Club on Schomberg Road. At the , Peterborough had a population of 178, which had grown to 247 at the 2016 census. The town is situated near The Twelve Apostles and London Arch land formations, and is part of the Shipwreck Coast. Many ships have been wrecked in the vicinity, due to limestone cliffs eroding away and leaving patches of harder rock concealed just under the waves quite a distance out to sea. This erosion continues, evidenced by the London Bridge formation collapsing in the early 1990s to form London Arch. One of the most famous wrecks was the Falls of Halladale which was wrecked in 1908 in thick fog, and became a tourist attraction for the next few years as it remained on the reef it was stuck on.

It is a white hygroscopic crystalline material. It is soluble in water and slightly soluble in ethanol, and is available commercially in anhydrous form and as the monohydrate (LiOH.H2O). While lithium hydroxide is a strong base, it is the weakest known alkali metal hydroxide. Production and reactions Lithium hydroxide is produced in a metathesis reaction between lithium carbonate and calcium hydroxide: :Li2CO3 \\\\+ Ca(OH)2 ‚Üí 2 LiOH + CaCO3 The initially produced hydrate is dehydrated by heating under vacuum up to 180 ¬∞C. In the laboratory, lithium hydroxide arises by the action of water on lithium or lithium oxide. The equations for these processes follow: :2 Li + 2 H2O ‚Üí 2 LiOH + H2 : Li2O + H2O ‚Üí 2 LiOH Typically, these reactions are avoided. Although lithium carbonate is more widely used, the hydroxide is an effective precursor to lithium salts, e.g. :LiOH + HF ‚Üí LiF + H2O. = Gas phase chemistry = The acidity of LiOH has been measured in the gas phase. The oxidolithium anion, LiO‚Äì, was produced by successive decarboxylation and decarbonylation of monolithium oxalate anion, LiO(C=O)(C=O)O‚Äì, by collision-induced dissociation and was identified by its exact mass. The gas-phase acidity of LiOH was inferred from the experimentally determined electron affinity of LiO‚Ä¢ and previously known heats of formation to give a value of 426 ¬± 2 kcal/mol. This is considerably higher than the gas-phase acidity of water (390 kcal/mol) and even exceeds that of methane (417 kcal/mol). Thus, LiOH is a very weak acid and is in fact the weakest acid yet measured in the gas phase. Applications Lithium hydroxide is mainly consumed in the production of lithium greases. A popular lithium grease thickener is Lithium 12-hydroxystearate, which produces a general-purpose lubricating grease due to its high resistance to water and usefulness at a range of temperatures. =Carbon dioxide scrubbing= Lithium hydroxide is used in breathing gas purification systems for spacecraft, submarines, and rebreathers to remove carbon dioxide from exhaled gas by producing lithium carbonate and water: :2 LiOH‚Ä¢H2O + CO2 ‚Üí Li2CO3 \\\\+ 3 H2O or :2 LiOH + CO2 ‚Üí Li2CO3 \\\\+ H2O The latter, anhydrous hydroxide, is preferred for its lower mass and lesser water production for respirator systems in spacecraft. One gram of anhydrous lithium hydroxide can remove 450 cm3 of carbon dioxide gas. The monohydrate loses its water at 100‚Äì110 ¬∞C. = Other uses = It is used as a heat transfer medium and as a storage-battery electrolyte. It is also used in ceramics and some Portland cement formulations. Lithium hydroxide (isotopically enriched in lithium-7) is used to alkalize the reactor coolant in pressurized water reactors for corrosion control.Managing Critical Isotopes: Stewardship of Lithium-7 Is Needed to Ensure a Stable Supply, GAO-13-716 // U.S. Government Accountability Office, 19 September 2013; pdf Market In 2012, the price of lithium hydroxide was about $5,000 to $6,000 per tonne.

The Office of Fair Trading in the United Kingdom has outlined two types of domain name scams which are \\"Domain name registration scams\\" and \\"Domain name renewal scams\\".  Domain slamming  Domain slamming (also known as unauthorized transfers or domain name registration scams) is a scam in which the offending domain name registrar attempts to trick domain owners into switching from their existing registrar to theirs, under the pretense that the customer is simply renewing their subscription to their current registrar. The term derives from telephone slamming. = Prevention = In 2004, ICANN, the domain name governing body, made changes to its policy for transferring domains between registrars. They introduced a single protective measure that can help prevent unauthorized transfers: domain locking. Critics, although advising owners to apply the new feature, said that this was an \\"unnecessary and customer-unfriendly change\\".  False offers to buy, or to find buyers  Scam methods may operate in reverse, with a stranger (not the registrar) communicating an offer to buy a domain name from an unwary owner. The offer is not genuine, but intended to lure the owner into a false sales process, with the owner eventually pressed to send money in advance to the scammer for appraisal fees or other purported services. By mimicking aspects of the legitimate sales process and agencies, the scheme appears genuine in the early stages. The prospect of an easy, lucrative sale disarms the owner's normal suspicion of an unsolicited offer from a stranger with no earnest value. Since an actual transfer through the registration system is never involved, legal safeguards built into the official transfer process provide no protection.  Fake trademark protection  Although less common than domain slamming, another domain name scam primarily coming from registrars based in China involves sending domain owners an e-mail claiming that another company has just attempted to register a number of domains with them which contain the targeted domain owner's trademark or has many keyword similarities to their existing domain name. Often, these domains will be the same as the one(s) owned by the targeted individual but with different TLDs (top-level domains). The scammer will claim to have halted the bulk registration in order to protect the targeted individual's intellectual property, and if the email recipient doesn't recognize the entity attempting to register these domain names, that they should respond immediately to protect their trademark. If the scam target does respond by email or by phone, the scammer will then try to get them to register these domain names for several years upfront with the registrar running this scam. Other variations of this type of scam include registrars that target their own existing customers with similar made-up threats of another entity trying to register the same domain as theirs under different TLDs. As well, some domainers are known to search for available TLDs for already registered domains, then emailing the owner of the registered domain and offering to sell the unregistered variations to him/her for a marked up amount. If the target agrees to the deal, the domainer will then purchase the domains on the spot for the regular $7~20 registration fee and immediately sell it back to the victim for a few hundred dollars.  Timeline  This section outlines reported domain scams as a timeline of events, showing how they have evolved, the companies involved and the outcome of complaints. * In 2001, the federal Competition Bureau (of Canada) issued a warning about documents that appeared to be invoices sent out by a business called the Internet Registry of Canada (a Brandon Gray reseller). ** \\"Complaints received by the Competition Bureau indicate that the mailings from the 'Internet Registry of Canada' give the impression that it is affiliated with the Government of Canada or that it is an officially sanctioned agency registering domain names in Canada.

Named after its discoverer, the German anatomist Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle, the loop of Henle's main function is to create a concentration gradient in the medulla of the kidney. By means of a countercurrent multiplier system, which uses electrolyte pumps, the loop of Henle creates an area of high urea concentration deep in the medulla, near the papillary duct in the collecting duct system. Water present in the filtrate in the papillary duct flows through aquaporin channels out of the duct, moving passively down its concentration gradient. This process reabsorbs water and creates a concentrated urine for excretion. Structure The loop of Henle can be divided into four parts: *Thin descending limb of loop of Henle :The thin descending limb has low permeability to ions and urea, while being highly permeable to water. The loop has a sharp bend in the renal medulla going from descending to ascending thin limb. *Thin ascending limb of loop of Henle :The thin ascending limb is impermeable to water, but it is permeable to ions. *Ascending limb of loop of Henle :Sodium (Na+), potassium (K+) and chloride (Cl‚àí) ions are reabsorbed from the urine by secondary active transport by a Na-K-Cl cotransporter (NKCC2). The electrical and concentration gradient drives more reabsorption of Na+, as well as other cations such as magnesium (Mg2+) and calcium (Ca2+). *Cortical thick ascending limb :The cortical thick ascending limb drains urine into the distal convoluted tubule. The tissue type of the loop is simple squamous epithelium. The \\"thick\\" and \\"thin\\" terminology does not refer to the size of the lumen, but to the size of the epithelial cells.Human Anatomy 7th edition (p.705) The loop is also sometimes called the Nephron loop. =Blood supply= Counter current multiplier diagram The loop of Henle is supplied by blood in a series of straight capillaries descending from the cortical efferent arterioles. These capillaries (called the vasa recta; recta is from the Latin for \\"straight\\") also have a countercurrent multiplier mechanism that prevents washout of solutes from the medulla, thereby maintaining the medullary concentration. As water is osmotically driven from the descending limb into the interstitium, it readily enters the capillaries. The low bloodflow through the vasa recta allows time for osmotic equilibration, and can be altered by changing the resistance of the vessels' efferent arterioles. As well, blood in the vasa recta still has large proteins and ions which were not filtered through the glomerulus. This provides an oncotic pressure for ions to enter the vasa recta from the interstitium. The main function of the loop of Henle is to set up a concentration gradient. Physiology The descending loop of Henle receives isotonic (300 mOsm/L) fluid from the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT). The fluid is isotonic because as ions are reabsorbed by the gradient time system, water is also reabsorbed maintaining the osmolarity of the fluid in the PCT. Substances reabsorbed in the PCT include urea, water, potassium, sodium, chloride, glucose, amino acids, lactate, phosphate, and bicarbonate. Since water is also reabsorbed the volume of fluid in the loop of Henle is less than the PCT, approximately one-third of the original volume. The interstitium of the kidney increases in osmolarity outside as the loop of Henle descends from 600 mOsm/L in the outer medulla of the kidney to 1200 mOsm/L in the inner medulla. The descending portion of the loop of Henle is extremely permeable to water and is less permeable to ions, therefore water is easily reabsorbed here and solutes are not readily reabsorbed. The 300 mOsm/L fluid from the loop loses water to the higher concentration outside the loop and increases in tonicity until it reaches its maximum at the bottom of the loop. This area represents the highest concentration in the nephron, but the collecting duct can reach this same tonicity with maximum ADH effect. The ascending limb of the loop of Henle receives an even lower volume of fluid and has different characteristics compared to the descending limb. In the ascending portion, the loop becomes impermeable to water and the cells of the loop actively reabsorb solutes from the luminal fluid; therefore water is not reabsorbed and ions are readily reabsorbed. As ions leave the lumen via the Na-K-2Cl symporter and the Na-H antiporter, the concentration becomes more and more hypotonic until it reaches approximately 100-150 mOsm/L. The ascending limb is also called the diluting segment of the nephron because of its ability to dilute the fluid in the loop from 1200 mOsm/L to 100 mOsm/L. Flow of the fluid through the entire loop of Henle is considered slow. As flow increases, the ability of the loop to maintain its osmolar gradient is reduced. The vasa recta (capillary loops) also have a slow flow as well. Increases in vasa recta flow wash away metabolites and cause the medulla to lose osmolarity as well. Increases in flow will disrupt the kidney's ability to form concentrated urine. Overall the loop of Henle reabsorbs around 25% of filtered ions and 20% of the filtered water in a normal kidney. These ions are mostly Na+, Cl‚àí, K+, Ca2+ and HCO3‚àí. The powering force is the Na/K ATPase on the basolateral membrane which maintains the ion concentrations inside the cells. On the luminal membrane, Na enters the cells passively; using the Na-K-2Cl symporter. Then the Na/K ATPase will pump 3 Na out into the peritubular fluid and 2 K into the cell on the non-lumen side of the cell. This gives the lumen of the fluid in the loop a positive charge in comparison and creates a Na concentration gradient, which both push more Na into the cell via the Na-H antiporter. The hydrogen ion for the antiporter comes from the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, which takes water and carbon dioxide and forms bicarbonate and a hydrogen ion. The hydrogen ion is exchanged for the Na in the tubular fluid of the loop of Henle.

Background The Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service merged with the former Port Auxiliary Service in 1976 to form a component of Her Majesty's Naval Service that was known as marine services. Marine services existed to support the operations of the Royal Navy, Royal Marines and Royal Fleet Auxiliary. In the 1990s, marine services were put out to commercial tender by the Ministry of Defence Warship Support Agency (now absorbed into the Defence Equipment and Support organisation) and by 1996, all tugs, lifting craft, various tenders and management of HMNB Devonport, Portsmouth and Clyde were operated by Serco Denholm.Marine Services Planning Agreement By the mid 2000s, it was decided that the Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service would no longer provide marine services to HM Naval Service, and it would instead be delivered under a Private Finance Initiative instead.

known by the NATO reporting name Akula-II) class nuclear-powered attack submarine of the Russian Navy. Her keel was laid down on 16 June 1990 by Sevmash. She was launched on 10 December 1994, commissioned on 25 November 1995, and homeported in Gadzhievo. Vepr is armed with four 533 mm torpedo tubes which can use Type 53 torpedoes, RPK-6 or the RPK-2 missiles - older type and Kalibr type armament, naval mines, and four 650 mm torpedo tubes which can use Type 65 torpedoes, or the RPK-7 missile. 1998 incident Shortly before midnight, 10 September 1998, Vepr was in port at Severomorsk. Alexander Kuzminykh, a 19-year-old seaman who was being detained on punishment charges, broke out from his quarters, killed his guard by stabbing him with a chisel, then seized his AKS-74U assault rifle and shot dead five more sailors. He then took two hostages, whom he later killed. He barricaded himself in the torpedo room, and for 20 hours repeatedly threatened to set a fire to detonate the torpedoes. While Vepr had no nuclear weapons and her reactor was shut down, the detonation of her torpedoes while she was tied up at the dock would have ruptured her reactor, creating what the regional director of the Federal Security Service (FSB), Vladimir Prikhodko described as \\"a nuclear catastrophe ... a second Chernobyl.\\" Attempts to persuade him to surrender failed. Kuzminykh's mother was flown to the naval base but was unable to persuade her son to give himself up. The situation remained a standoff until early on the morning of 12 September, when a special anti-terrorist commando unit of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) stormed the torpedo room. Early reports indicated that he had been killed by the FSB, but later reports indicated that he committed suicide. FSB officers regretted that \\"there was no way to preserve Alexander Kuzminykh's life.\\" Kuzminykh was found fit when he was conscripted at a St. Petersburg enlistment office, even though he had suffered from a mental disorder and had been inhaling intoxicants. When Kuzminykh volunteered for the submarine service, he passed additional medical and psychiatric tests with high marks.  Refurbishment  The submarine was the first of the Akula classes (Project 971 and 971U) to be refurbished. All of them will be equipped to carry the Kalibr type missiles. Vepr rejoined the Northern Fleet in March 2020. It is expected to remain in service for another 25-30 years.First modernized Akula attack submarine returns to Northern Fleet (2020-03-25)  References  This article is based on information from the Bellona Foundation and various news stories. * deepstorm.ru// K-157 Category:Akula-class submarines Category:Ships built in the Soviet Union Category:Ships built by Sevmash Category:1994 ships Category:Ships of the Russian Northern Fleet Category:Active submarines of Russia ","title":"Russian submarine Vepr (K-157)"},{"id":"548818","text":"Snidely Whiplash is the archenemy of Dudley Do-Right in the Dudley Do-Right of the Mounties segments of the animated television series The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show (1959‚Äì64) conceived by American animator Jay Ward. The character was voiced by Hans Conried in the original cartoon series. Alfred Molina played Whiplash in the 1999 live-action film version Dudley Do-Right. Whiplash is the stereotypical villain in the style of stock characters found in silent movies and earlier stage melodrama, wearing black clothing and a top hat and with a handlebar moustache. Whiplash's henchman, Homer, usually wears a tuque. In the cartoon's opening segments, Whiplash is seen tying Nell Fenwick to a railroad track. He is the antithesis of Do-Right, who is the archetype of goodness and a Royal Canadian Mounted Policeman (RCMP). On one occasion Whiplash and Do-Right changed hats; Do-Right became the criminal supervillain who actually succeeds at crime and Whiplash became the RCMP hero for capturing the evil Do-Right. Note Gloria Swanson in Teddy at the Throttle 1917 The scene of Nell being tied to railroad tracks is an old running gag - Gloria Swanson was featured in a similar scene in a 1917 movie short.

According to the often unreliable Historia Augusta, he had served as military tribune under Valerian. Macrianus, his father and his brother Quietus, were in Mesopotamia in 260, for the Sassanid campaign of Emperor Valerian, when the Roman army was defeated, and the emperor was captured.K√∂rner, http://www.roman-emperors.org/galusurp.htm#Note%202 With help from his father, who kept the imperial treasure, and by the influence of Balista, Valerian's praefect, Macrianus gained the imperial office together with his brother Quietus, through the election by the army, in contrast with the lawful Emperor Gallienus, son and co-emperor with Valerian, who was far in the West. The two emperors and brothers were recognized in the eastern part of the Empire, having a stronghold in Egypt, the grain supplying province for the city of Rome. After having temporarily secured the Persian frontier, Macrianus Major and Macrianus Minor moved to the West to attack and eliminate their rival Gallienus. They were however defeated in autumn 261 by Aureolus, and later killed by their own soldiers at the father's request.

The term is derived from the Latin word praesidium meaning protection or defense. In the Americas, the fortresses were built to protect against pirates and rival colonists, as well as against resistance from Native Americans. In the Mediterranean and the Philippines, the presidios were outposts of Christian defense against Islamic raids. The presidios of Spanish-Philippines in particular, were centers where the martial art of Arnis de Mano was developed, combining Filipino, Latin- American and Spanish fighting techniques. Later in western North America, with independence, the Mexicans garrisoned the Spanish presidios on the northern frontier and followed the same pattern in unsettled frontier regions like the Presidio de Sonoma, at Sonoma, California, and the Presidio de Calabasas, in Arizona. In western North America, a rancho del rey or kings ranch would be established a short distance outside a presidio. This was a tract of land assigned to the presidio to furnish pasturage to the horses and other beasts of burden of the garrison. Mexico called this facility \\"rancho nacional\\".

Because of their power to destroy the obstacles to enlightenment, they are also termed krodha-vighnantaka, \\"fierce destroyers of obstacles\\".Linrothe, Rob. Ruthless Compassion: Wrathful Deities in Early Indo- Tibetan Esoteric Buddhist Art, 1999, page 12. Fierce deities are a notable feature of the iconography of Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism. These types of deities first appeared in India during the late 6th century with its main source being the Yaksha imagery and became a central feature of Indian Tantric Buddhism by the late 10th or early 11th century.Linrothe, Rob. Ruthless Compassion: Wrathful Deities in Early Indo-Tibetan Esoteric Buddhist Art, 1999, page x, 12. Overview Vajrayogini, a semi-wrathful dakini who is also known as sarvabuddha·∏çƒÅki·πáƒ´, the all-buddha Dakini. In non-Tantric traditions of Mahayana Buddhism, these beings are protector deities who destroy obstacles to the Buddhas and the Dharma, act as guardians against demons and gather together sentient beings to listen to the teachings of the Buddhas.Linrothe, Rob. Ruthless Compassion, 1999, page 13, 25. In Tantric Buddhism, they are considered to be fierce and terrifying forms of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas themselves. Enlightened beings may take on these forms in order to protect and aid confused sentient beings.Thurman, Robert. The Tibetan Book of the Dead: Liberation Through Understanding in the Between, page 149. They also represent the energy and power that is needed in order to transform negative mental factors into wisdom and compassion.Berzin, Alexander; Making Sense of Tantra, https://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/vajrayana/tantra-theory/making- sense-of-tantra/tantric-imagery#peaceful-and-forceful-figuresLinrothe, Rob. Ruthless Compassion, 1999, page xi. They represent the power and compassion of enlightened activity which uses multiple skillful means (upaya) to guide sentient beings as well as the transformative element of tantra which uses negative emotions as part of the path. According to Chogyam Trungpa, \\"wrathful yidams work more directly and forcefully with passion, aggression, and delusion‚Äîconquering and trampling them on the spot.\\"Ch√∂gyam Trungpa. The Collected Works of Ch√∂gyam Trungpa: Volume 3, Shambala, 2003, page 438. In Tantric Buddhist art, fierce deities are presented as terrifying, demonic looking beings adorned with human skulls and other ornaments associated with the charnel ground, as well as being often depicted with sexually suggestive attributes. According to Rob Linrothe, the sensual and fierce imagery represents \\"poison as its own antidote, harnessed obstacles as the liberating force\\" and notes that they are \\"metaphors for the internal yogic processes to gain enlightenment\\".Linrothe, Rob. Ruthless Compassion, 1999, page xi-xii. Tantric deities =Yidams= In Indo-Tibetan Vajrayana, Yidams are divine forms of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. The tantric practitioner is initiated into the mandala of a particular chosen deity (Sanskrit: I·π£·π≠a-devatƒÅ) and practices complex sadhanas (meditations) on the deity for the purpose of personal transformation.Buswell, Robert E.; Lopez, Donald S. (2013). The Princeton dictionary of Buddhism. Princeton and Oxford: Princeton University Press. . This Deity Yoga practice is central to tantric forms of Buddhism such as Tibetan Buddhism. Yidams can be peaceful, fierce and \\"semi-fierce\\" (having both fierce and peaceful aspects). Fierce deities can be divided into male and female categories.Wrathful Deities The Herukas (Tb. khrag 'thung, lit. \\"blood drinker\\") are enlightened masculine beings who adopt fierce forms to express their detachment from the world of ignorance, such as Yamantaka, Cakrasamvara, MahƒÅkƒÅla, or Vajrakilaya. Dakinis (Tb. khandroma, \\"sky-goer\\") are their feminine counterparts, sometimes depicted with a heruka and sometimes as independent deities. The most prevalent wrathful dakinis are Vajrayogini and VajravƒÅrƒÅhƒ´. Gallery File:Yamantaka Vajrabhairav.jpgYamantaka, also known as Vajrabhairava.

Comprising over 3,000,000 acres (12,000 km¬≤) of land, it ran for 200 miles (300 km) along the border with New Mexico, varying in width from 20 to 30 miles (30 to 50 km). The massive ranch stretched through ten counties in Texas, and at its peak regularly handled 150,000 head of cattle. History The XIT ranch was located in the western edge of the Texas Panhandle. This was anciently the territory of the Querecho Indians and Teyas. In 1879, the 16th Texas Legislature appropriated 3,000,000 acres (12,000 km¬≤) of land to finance a new state capitol. In 1882, in a special legislative session, the 17th Texas Legislature struck a bargain with Charles B. and John V. Farwell of Chicago, Illinois, under which a syndicate led by the Farwells, with mostly British investors, agreed to build a new Texas State Capitol in Austin and to accept the 3,000,000 acres (12,000 km¬≤) of Panhandle land as payment.Thumbnail History of the XIT Ranch; The XIT Museum website; retrieved March 20, 2009\\"Fairlawn: The Farwell/McGann Estate at 965 East Deerpath\\" Biography of Charles B. Farwell; retrieved March 17, 2011History of XIT Ranch; \\"My Turn;\\" Hidden Ancestors ; retrieved March 17, 2011 The ranch stretched across all or portions of Dallam, Hartley, Oldham, Deaf Smith, Parmer, Castro, Bailey, Lamb, Cochran, and Hockley Counties.; retrieved April 13, 2005. Total expense for the Capitol building materials and labor amounted to $3,744,630.60, of which the Syndicate Company paid $3,224,593.45. In return, they received 3,000,000 acres. Though Mathias Schnell won the contract for constructing the new building in January 1882, by May he had assigned all interest to Taylor, Babcock and Company. This company was composed of Col. Abner Taylor of Chicago, Col. A.C. Babcock of Canton, and John V. and Charles B. Farwell of Chicago. Abner Taylor was assigned company representative in June. Babcock inspected the Capitol Tract that same year, setting out from Tascosa on 23 March and arriving at the Yellow Houses on 27 April. His inspection noted the 1880 J.T. Munson survey, used to define the capitol lands, used the northwest boundary of the state defined by John H. Clark's 1859 survey. Clark's line defining the 103rd meridian, approved by Congress in 1891, turned out to be about one half mile west of the true meridian. The issue was not settled until John V. Farwell and President Taft were instrumental in passing a 16 Feb. 1911 joint resolution by Congress honoring the Clark line. This action saved Texas a strip of land one half mile wide and 310 miles long. In order to raise the capital needed to fence the ranch, build houses and barns, provide water, and purchase the cattle, John V. Farwell formed the Capitol Freehold Land and Investment Company, Limited, in London. The money was raised through the sale of debentures paying 5 percent interest. Directors of the company included John V. and Charles B. Farwell, Walter Potter, Henry Seton-Karr, Sir William Ewart, Edward M. Denny, Baron Thurlow, and the Marquis of Tweeddale, while the Earl of Aberdeen and Quintin Hogg were Trustees. The company existed until 1909, when all bonds had been redeemed, Company headquarters were located in the northern boundary of the ranch, at Buffalo Springs, with George Findlay directing business. Col. B.H. Campbell became general manager, and Berry Nations range foreman. The ranch started operations in 1885, purchasing cattle and moving them onto the ranch. By 1887, the herd was maintained at between 125,000 and 150,000, or about 20 acres per head. W.S. Mabry surveyed in the four-wire barbed wire fence line, and by 1886, 781 miles of fence were in place, including a 260 mile long west line and a 275 mile long east line. Cross fences were added by the late 1890s to make 94 pastures, bringing the total to 1500 miles of fence. A telephone line connected Tascosa to Alamocitos in 1888. Though the northern portion of the ranch had plenty of water near Buffalo Springs, the portion south of the Canadian River needed wells, which were also surveyed in by W.S. Mabry. By 1900, the ranch had 335 windmills averaging 34 feet high, with 12‚Äì18 foot wheels, producing water from an average depth of 125 feet. Additionally, 100 earthen dams were constructed. Trail driver Ab Blocker devised the XIT brand. The brand was simply made with a five inch long straight bar, applied five times. Yet, the XIT brand was not immune from \\"brand burning\\" by rustlers, which involved burning the original brand into another brand. Cowboy legends also kept alive the myth that the brand means \\"Ten In Texas.\\" Each calf was branded with XIT on its side, the last numeral of the year on its shoulder, and the number of the division on its jaw. XIT Ranch chuck wagon, Panhandle Plains Historical Museum The ranch was initially divided into 7 division headquarters, located at (1) Buffalo Springs, (2) Middle Water, (3) Ojo Bravo, (4) Rito Blanco, (5) Escarbada, (6) Spring Lake, and (7) Yellow Houses, with (8) Bovina added later. Each was equipped with residences, cellars, bunkhouses, store rooms, barns, corrals, and two-wagon freight outfit. Large warehouses were maintained at Tascosa in 1887, after the introduction of the Fort Worth and Denver Railroad, and in Bovina, after it was connected to the J.J. Hagerman's Pecos Valley and Northeastern Railroad in 1898. General headquarters were moved to Channing in 1890. Each division wrote a monthly report and an annual report containing details about the cattle, range weather, and the men employed. Buffalo Springs became the steer ranch, Middle Water the cull ranch, while Ojo Bravo, Escarbada, Spring Lake and Yellow Houses became breeding ranges. The 10-12 cowboys working a division in the winter increased to 25-30 in the summer. Unfortunately, Campbell's management led to the ranch becoming a \\"stopping place and rendezvous for a large number of bad men and criminals,\\" in the words of A.L. Matlock. Matlock was picked by John V. Farwell to run the ranch in 1887. Matlock chose A.G. Boyce as his general range manager. The Texas Trail was used for trail drives connecting Tascosa to Dodge City until 1885. Afterwards, the Northern Trail connected Buffalo Springs to the XIT range on Cedar Creek, 60 miles north of Miles City, Montana. That trail was used from 1886 until 1897. Over a period of 3 months, some 10,000 to 12,500 steers were moved from the Yellow Houses 1000 miles north to Cedar Creek. There they would graze for two years before being shipped to Chicago. Though the original stock consisted of Texas Longhorn cattle, in 1889, work started to improve the herd by introducing Hereford cattle and Polled Angus cattle. Registered herds were bought in 1892, and the Rito Blanco division bred the Angus, while the Escarbada, Spring Lake and Yellow Houses divisions bred the Herefords. =Rules of the XIT Ranch= The XIT Ranch had 23 rules, on Abner Taylor's orders. They included prohibitions against carrying arms (No. 11); drinking alcohol (No. 15); and gambling (No. 12). Rule No. 22 stated the aim of the ranch was \\"sterling honesty and integrity\\". =Sold off= The original plan of the Capitol Company was colonization, with ranching viewed as a temporary use of the land until farmers arrived. In 1890, Matlock began using an immigration agency, and 80,000 acres were prepared as farming tracts. Cattle prices crashed in 1886 and 1887, and in the fall of 1888, the ranch was unable to sell its cattle and make a profit. The ranch operated most years without showing any profit. Predators such as the Mexican wolf and cattle rustling led to further losses. In 1901, the ranch syndicate began selling off acreage to pay the Capitol Freehold Land and Investment Company, Limited, bonds. Large tracts were sold to cattlemen such as George W. Littlefield, who bought 235,858.5 acres of Yellow Houses in 1901. In 1904, the ranch started using land and development companies for wholesale purchases, but in 1905, 800,000 acres were also divided up into 160-640 acre tracts. Finally, in 1905, to prevent speculation, the syndicate established a land commissioner, and in 1915, a real estate trust. This trust, Capitol Reservations Lands, operated until 31 Dec. 1950. Yet, Capitol Mineral Rights Company retained much of the mineral rights. The family of Minnie Lou Bradley, who went on to establish the Bradley 3 Ranch in Childress County east of Amarillo, made large purchases of XIT land. Other purchasers included Texas cattlemen William E. Halsell, and John M. Shelton. Lee Bivins bought 70,000 acres from XIT's Capitol Syndicate. Located near Channing, Texas, the purchase included XIT headquarters. The last of the XIT cattle were sold on 1 Nov. 1912. Recognizing that their earlier surveys exceeded the stipulated areas by 2-4 percent, the state of Texas sued the Syndicate in 1918, claiming the excess was 57,840.5 acres. As a consequence, the state recovered 27,613.6 acres in Dallam County, and 30,226.9 acres in Hartley County. Legacy In remembrance of the massive ranch, the City of Dalhart hosts the XIT Museum and the annual XIT Rodeo and Reunion held the first Thursday through Sunday of August. The celebration includes three days of junior and professional (PRCA) rodeo events, the world‚Äôs largest free barbecue, three nights of live music, a mud bog competition, an antique tractor-pull, and other activities. Several businesses in the Dalhart area use \\"XIT\\" in their names and styles. In popular culture The Charles Ives song, \\"Charlie Rutlage,\\" is about a poor XIT ranch hand who is killed. Cowboy artist Red Steagall song ‚Äú6000 miles of wire‚Äù is about the forming of the XIT ranch.

Lee played for Bolton Wanderers, Manchester City, Derby County and England. A fast forward, he won League Championship medals with Manchester City and Derby, and scored more than 200 goals in his career. In 2010, he was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame. He holds the English record for the greatest number of penalties scored in a season, a feat which earned him the nickname Lee Won Pen and led to accusations of diving. One such accusation, from Leeds United's Norman Hunter, led to an on-pitch fight. After retiring from football, Lee ran a successful toilet roll business, F.H. Lee Ltd, which made him a millionaire. In 1994, he became the major shareholder and chairman of Manchester City, but stepped down four years later. Playing career Lee started his professional career with Bolton Wanderers. Manchester City manager Joe Mercer signed him for a club record transfer fee of ¬£60,000 in 1967., p178 He made his Manchester City debut in a 2‚Äì0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers at Maine Road, and scored his first Manchester City goal the following week at Fulham. In his first season at the club, he scored 16 League goals in 31 appearances, playing a crucial role in City's push for the 1967‚Äì68 League Championship; Mercer described him as \\"the final piece of the jigsaw\\". The title was decided on the final day of the season, City requiring a win at Newcastle United. City won the match 4‚Äì3, Lee scoring one of the goals, and were crowned champions. The following season Lee was part of the Manchester City team which won the 1969 FA Cup. In the 1969‚Äì70 season, Lee was Manchester City's top scorer, an achievement he would subsequently match in each of the next four seasons. His tally that season included one of the most important goals of his career, a penalty in the final of the European Cup Winners' Cup. Lee represented England at the 1970 World Cup in Mexico and was the first English player ever to receive a card in a World Cup. In the 1971‚Äì72 season, Lee set a British record for the number of penalties scored in a season, with 15 of his 35 goals scored from the penalty spot. Many of the penalties resulted from fouls on Lee, earning him the nickname Lee One Pen. Some journalists, holding the opinion that Lee gained a number of penalties by diving, used the name Lee Won Pen instead. Lee's name is often cited in debates about diving in football; referees' chief Keith Hackett described him as a player who \\"had a reputation of falling down easily\\". Lee left Manchester City in 1974, joining Derby County. For the second time in his career, Lee joined a team viewed as contenders for that season's league title. He was upset at Manchester City's decision to sell him and marked his first match against his former club by scoring the winning goal for Derby. Lee scored twelve league goals that season, Derby winning their second League title and Lee the second championship medal of his career. On 1 November 1975, Lee had a confrontation with Leeds United defender Norman Hunter, which gained a level of infamy after it was screened on Match of the Day. In the first half of the game, the referee adjudged that Hunter had fouled Lee in the Leeds penalty area, and awarded Derby a penalty. Charlie George, and not Lee, took the penalty kick, and scored. In the second half, Lee and Hunter were seen to be exchanging punches in an off-the-ball incident. The referee stopped the game and took both players' names, but it was not immediately clear if he had sent off either or both of them. However, as the two men walked away they began fighting again. After intervention by both sets of players, Hunter left the pitch and Lee was restrained and ushered off the field by a club official. In 2003, the incident was named by The Observer as sport's most spectacular dismissal. Lee also held the record for the most goals in Manchester derbies, scoring 10 goals in all against Manchester United, a tally that equalled Joe Hayes' record. This record was later beaten by Wayne Rooney who scored his 11th goal in a Manchester derby on 22 September 2013. Business career After his playing career, Lee moved into business. His toilet roll manufacturing business once employed Peter Kay, later a famous comedian, who mentions his time there in his autobiography \\"The Sound Of Laughter\\". In 1994, Lee became chairman of Manchester City, ousting Peter Swales from the position by purchasing ¬£3 million of shares at a price of ¬£13.35 per share. Lee was welcomed as a hero by City's supporters, who had formed a movement named Forward With Franny backing his attempt to gain control of the club. Upon becoming chairman, Lee made a series of extravagant claims about his plans for the club, announcing that \\"This will be the happiest club in the land. The players will be the best paid and we'll drink plenty of champagne, celebrate and sing until we're hoarse\\". In 1995, he appointed his friend Alan Ball as manager, but the appointment proved unsuccessful and the club were relegated. Lee stepped down in 1998, with the club on the brink of relegation to the third tier of English football, a fate which Lee had dismissed at the previous annual general meeting by saying that he would \\"jump off the Kippax\\" if the club were relegated. He was succeeded by David Bernstein. Lee retained a shareholding after leaving the board of directors but later sold all his shares to Thaksin Shinawatra. In addition to his business ventures, Lee also had a career as a racehorse trainer. Notable horses trained by Lee include Sir Harry Hardman, Allwight Then and Young Jason. Lee gave the trade up in 2001 to pursue his business commitments. Before becoming a professional footballer Lee showed promise at cricket, representing the Horwich and Westhoughton Schools FA Team in 1958. When his football career came to an end, he briefly returned to cricket, playing for Westhoughton's first XI in 1977 as a medium-fast bowler and middle to lower order batsman. Lee was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to football and charity.

History Quietus was the son of Fulvius MacrianusJones, pg. 757 and a noblewoman, possibly named Junia. According to Historia Augusta, he was a military tribune under Valerian,Historia Augusta, Tyranni Triginta, 12:10 but this information is challenged by historians. He gained the imperial office with his brother Macrianus Minor, after the capture of Emperor Valerian in the Sassanid campaign of 260.Jones, pg. 758 With the lawful heir, Gallienus, being far away in the West, the soldiers elected the two emperors.

Booster (Space Shuttle SRB) was the first solid-propellant rocket to be used for primary propulsion on a vehicle used for human spaceflight and provided the majority of the Space Shuttle's thrust during the first two minutes of flight. After burnout, they were jettisoned and parachuted into the Atlantic Ocean where they were recovered, examined, refurbished, and reused. The Space Shuttle SRB was the most powerful solid rocket motor ever flown. Each provided a maximum thrust, roughly double the most powerful single-combustion chamber liquid-propellant rocket engine ever flown, the Rocketdyne F-1. With a combined mass of about , they comprised over half the mass of the Shuttle stack at liftoff. The motor segments of the SRBs were manufactured by Thiokol of Brigham City, Utah, which was later purchased by ATK. The prime contractor for most other components of the SRBs, as well as for the integration of all the components and retrieval of the spent SRBs, was USBI, a subsidiary of Pratt and Whitney. This contract was subsequently transitioned to United Space Alliance, a limited liability company joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Out of 270 SRBs launched over the Shuttle program, all but four were recovered ‚Äì those from STS-4 (due to a parachute malfunction) and STS-51-L (Challenger disaster). Over 5,000 parts were refurbished for reuse after each flight. The final set of SRBs that launched STS-135 included parts that flew on 59 previous missions, including STS-1. Recovery also allowed post-flight examination of the boosters, identification of anomalies, and incremental design improvements. Overview Static test firing, 1978 Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) separation The two reusable SRBs provided the main thrust to lift the shuttle off the launch pad and up to an altitude of about . While on the pad, the two SRBs carried the entire weight of the external tank and orbiter and transmitted the weight load through their structure to the mobile launcher platform. Each booster had a liftoff thrust of approximately at sea level, increasing shortly after liftoff to about . They were ignited after the three RS-25 main engines' thrust level was verified. Seventy-five seconds after SRB separation, SRB apogee occurred at an altitude of approximately ; parachutes were then deployed and impact occurred in the ocean approximately downrange, after which the two SRBs were recovered. The SRBs helped take the Space Shuttle to an altitude of and a speed of along with the main engines. The SRBs committed the shuttle to liftoff and ascent (to orbit) flight, without the possibility of launch or liftoff/ascent abort, until both motors had fully, and simultaneously, fulfilled their functions, consumed their propellants, were producing zero net reaction thrust and had been jettisoned (again simultaneously) by explosive jettisoning bolts from the remainder of the vehicle launch \\"stack\\" (shuttle w/engines; fuel/oxidizer tank). Only then could any conceivable set of launch or post-liftoff abort procedures be contemplated. In addition, failure of an individual SRB's thrust output or ability to adhere to the designed performance profile was probably not survivable.https://spaceflight.nasa.gov/outreach/SignificantIncidents/assets/rogers_commission_report.pdf The SRBs were the largest solid-propellant motors ever flown and the first of such large rockets designed for reuse. Each is long and in diameter. Each SRB weighed approximately at launch. The two SRBs constituted about 69% of the total lift-off mass. The primary propellants were ammonium perchlorate (oxidizer) and atomized aluminum powder (fuel), and the total propellant for each solid rocket motor weighed approximately (see ). The inert weight of each SRB was approximately . Primary elements of each booster were the motor (including case, propellant, igniter, and nozzle), structure, separation systems, operational flight instrumentation, recovery avionics, pyrotechnics, deceleration system, thrust vector control system, and range safety destruct system. While the terms solid rocket motor and solid rocket booster are often used interchangeably, in technical use they have specific meanings. The term solid rocket motor applied to the propellant, case, igniter and nozzle. Solid rocket booster applied to the entire rocket assembly, which included the rocket motor as well as the recovery parachutes, electronic instrumentation, separation rockets, range safety destruct system, and thrust vector control. Each booster was attached to the external tank at the SRB's aft frame by two lateral sway braces and a diagonal attachment. The forward end of each SRB was attached to the external tank at the forward end of the SRB's forward skirt. On the launch pad, each booster also was attached to the mobile launcher platform at the aft skirt by four frangible nuts that were severed at liftoff. The boosters were composed of seven individually manufactured steel segments. These were assembled in pairs by the manufacturer, and then shipped to Kennedy Space Center by rail for final assembly. The segments were fixed together using circumferential tang, clevis, and clevis pin fastening, and sealed with O-rings (originally two, changed to three after the Challenger Disaster in 1986) and heat-resistant putty. Components SRB Diagram =Hold-down posts= Each solid rocket booster had four hold-down posts that fit into corresponding support posts on the mobile launcher platform. Hold-down bolts held the SRB and launcher platform posts together. Each bolt had a nut at each end, the top one being a frangible nut. The top nut contained two NASA standard detonators (NSDs), which were ignited at solid rocket motor ignition commands. When the two NSDs were ignited at each hold down, the hold-down bolt traveled downward because of the release of tension in the bolt (pretensioned before launch), NSD gas pressure and gravity. The bolt was stopped by the stud deceleration stand, which contained sand. The SRB bolt was long and in diameter. The frangible nut was captured in a blast container. The solid rocket motor ignition commands were issued by the orbiter's computers through the master events controllers to the hold-down pyrotechnic initiator controllers (PICs) on the mobile launcher platform. They provided the ignition to the hold-down NSDs. The launch processing system monitored the SRB hold- down PICs for low voltage during the last 16 seconds before launch. PIC low voltage would initiate a launch hold. =Electrical power distribution= Electrical power distribution in each SRB consisted of orbiter-supplied main DC bus power to each SRB via SRB buses labeled A, B and C. Orbiter main DC buses A, B and C supplied main DC bus power to corresponding SRB buses A, B and C. In addition, orbiter main DC bus C supplied backup power to SRB buses A and B, and orbiter bus B supplied backup power to SRB bus C. This electrical power distribution arrangement allowed all SRB buses to remain powered in the event one orbiter main bus failed. The nominal operating voltage was DC. =Hydraulic power units= There were two self-contained, independent Hydraulic Power Units (HPUs) on each SRB. Each HPU consisted of an auxiliary power unit (APU), fuel supply module, hydraulic pump, hydraulic reservoir and hydraulic fluid manifold assembly. The APUs were fueled by hydrazine and generated mechanical shaft power to drive a hydraulic pump that produced hydraulic pressure for the SRB hydraulic system. The two separate HPUs and two hydraulic systems were located on the aft end of each SRB between the SRB nozzle and aft skirt. The HPU components were mounted on the aft skirt between the rock and tilt actuators. The two systems operated from T minus 28 seconds until SRB separation from the orbiter and external tank. The two independent hydraulic systems were connected to the rock and tilt servoactuators. The HPU controller electronics were located in the SRB aft integrated electronic assemblies on the aft external tank attach rings. The HPUs and their fuel systems were isolated from each other. Each fuel supply module (tank) contained of hydrazine. The fuel tank was pressurized with gaseous nitrogen at , which provided the force to expel (positive expulsion) the fuel from the tank to the fuel distribution line, maintaining a positive fuel supply to the APU throughout its operation. In the APU, a fuel pump boosted the hydrazine pressure and fed it to a gas generator. The gas generator catalytically decomposed the hydrazine into hot, high-pressure gas; a two-stage turbine converted this into mechanical power, driving a gearbox. The waste gas, now cooler and at low pressure, was passed back over the gas generator housing to cool it before being dumped overboard. The gearbox drove the fuel pump, its own lubrication pump, and the HPU hydraulic pump. As described so far, the system could not self-start, since the fuel pump was driven by the turbine it supplied fuel to. Accordingly, a bypass line went around the pump and fed the gas generator using the nitrogen tank pressure until the APU speed was such that the fuel pump outlet pressure exceeded that of the bypass line, at which point all the fuel was supplied to the fuel pump. When the APU speed reached 100%, the APU primary control valve closed, and the APU speed was controlled by the APU controller electronics. If the primary control valve logic failed to the open state, the secondary control valve assumed control of the APU at 112% speed. Each HPU on an SRB was connected to both servoactuators on that SRB by a switching valve that allowed the hydraulic power to be distributed from either HPU to both actuators if necessary. Each HPU served as the primary hydraulic source for one servoactuator, and a secondary source for the other servoactuator. Each HPU possessed the capacity to provide hydraulic power to both servoactuators within 115% operational limits in the event that hydraulic pressure from the other HPU should drop below . A switch contact on the switching valve closed when the valve was in the secondary position. When the valve was closed, a signal was sent to the APU controller, that inhibited the 100% APU speed control logic and enabled the 112% APU speed control logic. The 100-percent APU speed enabled one APU/HPU to supply sufficient operating hydraulic pressure to both servoactuators of that SRB. The APU 100-percent speed corresponded to 72,000 rpm, 110% to 79,200 rpm, and 112% to 80,640 rpm. The hydraulic pump speed was 3,600 rpm and supplied hydraulic pressure of . A high pressure relief valve provided overpressure protection to the hydraulic system and relieved at . The APUs/HPUs and hydraulic systems were reusable for 20 missions. =Thrust vector control= Each SRB had two hydraulic gimbal servoactuators, to move the nozzle up/down and side-to-side. This provided thrust vectoring to help control the vehicle in all three axes (roll, pitch, and yaw). The ascent thrust vector control portion of the flight control system directed the thrust of the three shuttle main engines and the two SRB nozzles to control shuttle attitude and trajectory during lift-off and ascent. Commands from the guidance system were transmitted to the Ascent Thrust Vector Control (ATVC) drivers, which transmitted signals proportional to the commands to each servoactuator of the main engines and SRBs. Four independent flight control system channels and four ATVC channels controlled six main engine and four SRB ATVC drivers, with each driver controlling one hydraulic port on each main and SRB servoactuator. Each SRB servoactuator consisted of four independent, two-stage servovalves that received signals from the drivers. Each servovalve controlled one power spool in each actuator, which positioned an actuator ram and the nozzle to control the direction of thrust. The four servovalves operating each actuator provided a force-summed majority-voting arrangement to position the power spool. With four identical commands to the four servovalves, the actuator force-sum action prevented, instantaneously, a single erroneous input affecting power ram motion. If differential-pressure sensing detected the erroneous input persisting over a predtermined time, an isolating valve would be selected, excluding it from the force-sum entirely. Failure monitors were provided for each channel to indicate which channel had been bypassed, and the isolation valve on each channel could be reset. Each actuator ram was equipped with transducers for position feedback to the thrust vector control system. Within each servoactuator ram was a splashdown load relief assembly to cushion the nozzle at water splashdown and prevent damage to the nozzle flexible bearing. =Rate gyro assemblies= Each SRB contained three rate gyro assemblies (RGAs), with each RGA containing one pitch and one yaw gyro. These provided an output proportional to angular rates about the pitch and yaw axes to the orbiter computers and guidance, navigation and control system during first-stage ascent flight in conjunction with the orbiter roll rate gyros until SRB separation. At SRB separation, a switchover was made from the SRB RGAs to the orbiter RGAs. The SRB RGA rates passed through the orbiter flight aft multiplexers/demultiplexers to the orbiter GPCs. The RGA rates were then mid-value-selected in redundancy management to provide SRB pitch and yaw rates to the user software. The RGAs were designed for 20 missions. =Segment cases= Made out of 2-cm-thick D6AC high-strength low-alloy steel. =Propellant= Sections of the SRB filled with propellant being connected The rocket propellant mixture in each solid rocket motor consisted of ammonium perchlorate (oxidizer, 69.6% by weight), atomized aluminum powder (fuel, 16%), iron oxide (catalyst, 0.4%), PBAN (binder, also acts as fuel, 12.04%), and an epoxy curing agent (1.96%). This propellant is commonly referred to as ammonium perchlorate composite propellant (APCP). This mixture gave the solid rocket motors a specific impulse of at sea level or in a vacuum. The main fuel, aluminum, was used because it has a reasonable specific energy density of about 31.0 MJ/kg, but a high volumetric energy density, and is difficult to ignite accidentally. The propellant had an 11-pointed star-shaped perforation in the forward motor segment and a double- truncated-cone perforation in each of the aft segments and aft closure. This configuration provided high thrust at ignition and then reduced the thrust by approximately a third 50 seconds after lift-off to avoid overstressing the vehicle during maximum dynamic pressure (max. Q). Function SRB sea-level thrust, data from STS-107 =Ignition= SRB ignition can occur only when a manual lock pin from each SRB safe and arm device has been removed. The ground crew removes the pin during prelaunch activities. At T‚àí5:00, the SRB safe and arm device is rotated to the arm position. The solid rocket motor ignition commands are issued when the three Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs) are at or above 90% of rated thrust, no SSME fail and/or SRB ignition Pyrotechnic Initiator Controller (PIC) low voltage is indicated and there are no holds from the Launch Processing System (LPS). The solid rocket motor ignition commands are sent by the orbiter computers through the Master Events Controllers (MECs) to the safe and arm device NASA standard detonators (NSDs) in each SRB. A PIC single-channel capacitor discharge device controls the firing of each pyrotechnic device. Three signals must be present simultaneously for the PIC to generate the pyro firing output. These signals, arm, fire 1 and fire 2, originate in the orbiter general-purpose computers (GPCs) and are transmitted to the MECs. The MECs reformat them to 28 volt DC signals for the PICs. The arm signal charges the PIC capacitor to 40 volts DC (minimum of 20 volts DC). The GPC launch sequence also controls certain critical main propulsion system valves and monitors the engine ready indications from the SSMEs. The MPS start commands are issued by the onboard computers at T‚àí6.6 seconds (staggered start engine three, engine two, engine one all approximately within 0.25 of a second), and the sequence monitors the thrust buildup of each engine. All three SSMEs must reach the required 90% thrust within three seconds; otherwise, an orderly shutdown is commanded and safing functions are initiated. Normal thrust buildup to the required 90% thrust level will result in the SSMEs being commanded to the lift off position at T‚àí3 seconds as well as the fire 1 command being issued to arm the SRBs. At T‚àí3 seconds, the vehicle base bending load modes are allowed to initialize (referred to as the \\"twang\\", movement of approximately measured at the tip of the external tank, with movement towards the external tank). The fire 2 commands cause the redundant NSDs to fire through a thin barrier seal down a flame tunnel. This ignites a pyro. booster charge, which is retained in the safe and arm device behind a perforated plate. The booster charge ignites the propellant in the igniter initiator; and combustion products of this propellant ignite the solid rocket motor initiator, which fires down the entire vertical length of the solid rocket motor igniting the solid rocket motor propellant along its entire surface area instantaneously. At T‚àí0, the two SRBs are ignited, under command of the four onboard computers; separation of the four explosive bolts on each SRB is initiated; the two T-0 umbilicals (one on each side of the spacecraft) are retracted; the onboard master timing unit, event timer and mission event timers are started; the three SSMEs are at 100%; and the ground launch sequence is terminated. =Lift-off and ascent= Timing sequence referencing in ignition is critical for a successful liftoff and ascent flight. The explosive hold-down bolts relieve (through the launch support pedestals and pad structure) the asymmetric vehicle dynamic loads caused by the SSME ignition and thrust buildup, and applied thrust bearing loads. Without the hold-down bolts the SSMEs would violently tip the flight stack (orbiter, external tank, SRBs) over onto the external tank. That rotating moment is initially countered by the hold-bolts. Prior to release of the vehicle stack for liftoff, the SRBs must simultaneously ignite and pressurize their combustion chambers and exhaust nozzles to produce a thrust derived, net counter-rotating moment exactly equal to the SSME's rotating moment. With the SRBs reaching full thrust, the hold-down bolts are blown, releasing the vehicle stack, the net rotating moment is zero, and the net vehicle thrust (opposing gravity) is positive, lifting the orbiter stack vertically from the launch pedestal, controllable through the coordinated gimbal movements of the SSMEs and the SRB exhaust nozzles. During ascent, multiple all-axis accelerometers detect and report the vehicle's flight and orientation (referencing the flight deck aboard the orbiter), as the flight reference computers translate navigation commands (steering to a particular waypoint in space, and at a particular time) into engine and motor nozzle gimbal commands, which orient the vehicle about its center of mass. As the forces on the vehicle change due to propellant consumption, increasing speed, changes in aerodynamic drag, and other factors, the vehicle automatically adjusts its orientation in response to its dynamic control command inputs. The net result is a relatively smooth and constant (then gradually decreasing) gravitational pull due to acceleration, coupled with a diminishing aerodynamic friction as the upper atmosphere is reached and surpassed. =Separation= The SRBs are jettisoned from the space shuttle at high altitude, about . SRB separation is initiated when the three solid-rocket motor-chamber pressure transducers are processed in the redundancy-management middle-value select and the head-end chamber pressure of both SRBs is less than or equal to . A backup cue is the time elapsed from booster ignition. The separation sequence is initiated, commanding the thrust vector control actuators to the null position and putting the main propulsion system into a second-stage configuration (0.8 seconds from sequence initialization), which ensures the thrust of each SRB is less than . Orbiter yaw attitude is held for four seconds, and SRB thrust drops to less than . The SRBs separate from the external tank within 30 milliseconds of the ordnance firing command. The forward attachment point consists of a ball (SRB) and socket (External Tank; ET) held together by one bolt. The bolt contains one NSD pressure cartridge at each end. The forward attachment point also carries the range safety system cross-strap wiring connecting each SRB RSS and the ET RSS with each other. The aft attachment points consist of three separate struts: upper, diagonal and lower. Each strut contains one bolt with an NSD pressure cartridge at each end. The upper strut also carries the umbilical interface between its SRB and the external tank and on to the orbiter. There are four booster separation motors (BSMs) on each end of each SRB. The BSMs separate the SRBs from the external tank. The solid rocket motors in each cluster of four are ignited by firing redundant NSD pressure cartridges into redundant confined detonating fuse manifolds. The separation commands issued from the orbiter by the SRB separation sequence initiate the redundant NSD pressure cartridge in each bolt and ignite the BSMs to effect a clean separation. =Range safety system= A range safety system (RSS) provides for destruction of a rocket or part of it with on-board explosives by remote command if the rocket is out of control, in order to limit the danger to people on the ground from crashing pieces, explosions, fire, poisonous substances, etc. The RSS was only activated once ‚Äì during the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster (37 seconds after the breakup of the vehicle, when the SRBs were in uncontrolled flight). The shuttle vehicle had two RSSs, one in each SRB. Both were capable of receiving two command messages (arm and fire) transmitted from the ground station. The RSS was used only when the shuttle vehicle violates a launch trajectory red line. An RSS consists of two antenna couplers, command receivers/decoders, a dual distributor, a safe and arm device with two NASA standard detonators (NSD), two confined detonating fuse manifolds (CDF), seven CDF assemblies and one linear-shaped charge (LSC). The antenna couplers provide the proper impedance for radio frequency and ground support equipment commands. The command receivers are tuned to RSS command frequencies and provide the input signal to the distributors when an RSS command is sent. The command decoders use a code plug to prevent any command signal other than the proper command signal from getting into the distributors. The distributors contain the logic to supply valid destruct commands to the RSS pyrotechnics. The NSDs provide the spark to ignite the CDF, which in turn ignites the LSC for booster destruction. The safe and arm device provides mechanical isolation between the NSDs and the CDF before launch and during the SRB separation sequence. The first message, called arm, allows the onboard logic to enable a destruct and illuminates a light on the flight deck display and control panel at the commander and pilot station. The second message transmitted is the fire command. The SRB distributors in the SRBs are cross-strapped together. Thus, if one SRB received an arm or destruct signal, the signal would also be sent to the other SRB. Electrical power from the RSS battery in each SRB is routed to RSS system A. The recovery battery in each SRB is used to power RSS system B as well as the recovery system in the SRB. The SRB RSS is powered down during the separation sequence, and the SRB recovery system is powered up. =Descent and recovery= Splashdown of the right hand SRB from the launch of STS-124. The SRBs are jettisoned from the shuttle system at 2 minutes and an altitude of about 146,000 feet (44 km). After continuing to rise to about 220,000 feet (67 km), the SRBs begin to fall back to earth and once back in the denser atmosphere are slowed by a parachute system to prevent damage on ocean impact. A command is sent from the orbiter to the SRB just before separation to apply battery power to the recovery logic network. A second, simultaneous command arms the three nose cap thrusters (for deploying the pilot and drogue parachute), the frustum ring detonator (for main parachute deployment), and the main parachute disconnect ordnance. The recovery sequence begins with the operation of the high-altitude baroswitch, which triggers the pyrotechnic nose cap thrusters. This ejects the nose cap, which deploys the pilot parachute. Nose cap separation occurs at a nominal altitude of , about 218 seconds after SRB separation. The diameter conical ribbon pilot parachute provides the force to pull lanyards attached to cut knives, which cut the loop securing the drogue retention straps. This allows the pilot chute to pull the drogue pack from the SRB, causing the drogue suspension lines to deploy from their stored position. At full extension of the twelve suspension lines, the drogue deployment bag is stripped away from the canopy, and the diameter conical ribbon drogue parachute inflates to its initial reefed condition. The drogue disreefs twice after specified time delays (using redundant 7- and 12-second reefing line cutters), and it reorients/stabilizes the SRB for main chute deployment. The drogue parachute has a design load of approximately and weighs approximately . Space Shuttle Discovery following the launch of STS-116, floating in the Atlantic Ocean about 150 miles northeast of Cape Canaveral. On this occasion, the boosters landed several miles apart, but overnight winds and currents drifted them to the same location After the drogue chute has stabilized the SRB in a tail-first attitude, the frustum is separated from the forward skirt by a pyrotechnic charge triggered by the low-altitude baroswitch at a nominal altitude of about 243 seconds after SRB separation. The frustum is then pulled away from the SRB by the drogue chute. The main chute suspension lines are pulled out from deployment bags that remain in the frustum. At full extension of the lines, which are long, the three main chutes are pulled from their deployment bags and inflate to their first reefed condition. The frustum and drogue parachute continue on a separate trajectory to splashdown. After specified time delays (using redundant 10- and 17-second reefing line cutters), the main chute reefing lines are cut and the chutes inflate to their second reefed and full open configurations. The main chute cluster decelerates the SRB to terminal conditions. Each of the diameter, 20¬∞ conical ribbon parachutes have a design load of approximately and each weighs approximately . These parachutes are the largest that have ever been used, in both deployed size and load weight. The RSRM nozzle extension is severed by a pyrotechnic charge about 20 seconds after frustum separation. Water impact occurs about 279 seconds after SRB separation at a nominal velocity of . The water impact range is approximately off the eastern coast of Florida. Because the parachutes provide for a nozzle-first impact, air is trapped in the empty (burned out) motor casing, causing the booster to float with the forward end approximately out of the water. Solid rocket booster of the STS-131 mission being recovered and transported to Cape Canaveral by the . Formerly, the main chutes were released from the SRB at impact using a parachute release nut ordnance system (residual loads in the main chutes would deploy the parachute attach fittings with floats tethered to each fitting). The current design keeps the main chutes attached during water impact (initial impact and slapdown). Salt Water Activated Release (SWAR) devices are now incorporated into the main chute riser lines to simplify recovery efforts and reduce damage to the SRB. The drogue deployment bag/pilot parachutes, drogue parachutes and frustums, each main chute, and the SRBs are buoyant and are recovered. Specially fitted NASA recovery ships, the and the , recover the SRBs and descent/recovery hardware. Once the boosters are located, the Diver Operated Plug (DOP) is maneuvered by divers into place to plug the SRB nozzle and drain the water from the motor case. Pumping air into and water out of the SRB causes the SRB to change from a nose-up floating position to a horizontal attitude more suitable for towing. The retrieval vessels then tow the boosters and other objects recovered back to Kennedy Space Center. Challenger disaster Space Shuttle Challenger before the start of STS-51-L. The loss of Space Shuttle Challenger originated with a system failure of one of its SRBs. The cause of the accident was found by the Rogers Commission to be \\"a faulty design unacceptably sensitive to a number of factors\\" of the SRB joints compounded by unusually cold weather the morning of the flight. The commission found that the large rubber \\"O-rings\\" in SRB joints were not effective at low temperatures like those of the January 1986 morning of the accident (). A cold-compromised joint in the right SRB failed at launch and eventually allowed hot gases from within that rocket booster to sear a hole into the adjacent main external fuel tank and also weaken the lower strut holding the SRB to the external tank. The leak in the SRB joint caused a catastrophic failure of the lower strut and partial detachment of the SRB, which led to a collision between the SRB and the external tank. With a disintegrating external tank and severely off-axis thrust from the right SRB, traveling at a speed of Mach1.92 at , the Space Shuttle stack disintegrated and was enveloped in an \\"explosive burn\\" (i.e. rapid deflagration) of the liquid propellants from the external tank. Concerns were briefed by the SRB manufacturer due to the cold temperatures, but were overridden due to resistance from NASA managers to change launch criteria at such a late stage in launch preparation. During the subsequent downtime, detailed structural analyses were performed on critical structural elements of the SRB. Analyses were primarily focused in areas where anomalies had been noted during postflight inspection of recovered hardware. One of the areas was the attachment ring where the SRBs are connected to the external tank. Areas of distress were noted in some of the fasteners where the ring attaches to the SRB motor case. This situation was attributed to the high loads encountered during water impact. To correct the situation and ensure higher strength margins during ascent, the attach ring was redesigned to encircle the motor case completely (360¬∞). Previously, the attachment ring formed a 'C' shape and encircled the motor case just 270¬∞. The right SRB shows an anomalous plume at T+58.788 seconds. This plume would trigger the breakup of the vehicle 14 seconds later. Additionally, special structural tests were performed on the aft skirt. During this test program, an anomaly occurred in a critical weld between the hold-down post and skin of the skirt. A redesign was implemented to add reinforcement brackets and fittings in the aft ring of the skirt. These two modifications added approximately to the weight of each SRB. The result is called a Redesigned Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM). Construction The prime contractor for the manufacture of the SRB motor segments was ATK Launch Systems (formerly Morton Thiokol Inc.) Wasatch Division based in Magna, Utah. United Space Boosters Inc. (USBI), a division of Pratt and Whitney, under United Technologies, was the original SRB prime contractor for SRB assembly, checkout and refurbishment for all non-solid- rocket-motor components and for SRB integration. They were the longest running prime contractor for the Space Shuttle that was part of the original launch team. USBI was absorbed by United Space Alliance as the Solid Rocket Booster Element division in 1998 and the USBI division was disbanded at Pratt & Whitney the following year. At its peak, USBI had over 1500 personnel working on the Shuttle Boosters at KSC, FL and Huntsville, Alabama. Upgrade projects - not put into service =Advanced Solid Rocket Motor (ASRM) Project (1988‚Äì1993)= In 1988/9 NASA was planning on replacing the post-Challenger SRBs with a new Advanced Solid Rocket Motor (ASRM) to be built by AerojetLeary, Warren E., \\"NASA Picks Lockheed and Aerojet\\", New York Times, April 22, 1989 at a new facility, designed by subcontractor, RUST International, on the location of a cancelled Tennessee Valley Authority nuclear power plant, at Yellow Creek, Mississippi. The ASRM would be slightly wider (the booster's diameter would be increased from 146 inches to 150 inches) and have 200,000 pounds of extra propellant, and have produced additional thrust in order to increase shuttle payload by about 12,000lb, so that it could carry modules and construction components to the ISS. They were expected to be safer than the post-Challenger SRBs. The initial $1.2Bn contract was to be for 12 motors, with an option for another 88 at maybe another $1bn. Morton Thiokol would build the nozzles. The first test flight was expected around 1994. The ASRM program was cancelled in 1993 after robotic assembly systems and computers were on-site and approximately 2 billion dollars spent, in favor of continued use, after design flaw corrections, of the SRB. =Filament-wound cases= In order to provide the necessary performance to launch polar-orbiting shuttles from the SLC-6 launch pad at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, SRBs using filament-wound cases (FWC) were designed to be more lightweight than the steel cases used on Kennedy Space Center-launched SRBs.\\"Jerry L. Ross\\" NASA Johnson Space Center Oral History Project, 26 January 2004. Unlike the regular SRBs, which had the flawed field joint design that led to the Challenger Disaster in 1986, the FWC boosters had the \\"double tang\\" joint design (necessary to keep the boosters properly in alignment during the \\"twang\\" movement when the SSMEs are ignited prior to liftoff), but used the two O-ring seals. With the closure of SLC-6, the FWC boosters were scrapped by ATK and NASA, but their field joints, albeit modified to incorporate the current three O-ring seals and joint heaters, were later (after STS-51L) incorporated into the field joints on the SRBs used until the last flight in 2011. =Five-segment booster= Prior to the destruction of the Space Shuttle Columbia in 2003, NASA investigated the replacement of the current 4-segment SRBs with either a 5-segment SRB design or replacing them altogether with liquid \\"flyback\\" boosters using either Atlas V or Delta IV EELV technologies. The 5-segment SRB, which would have required little change to the current shuttle infrastructure, would have allowed the space shuttle to carry an additional of payload in an International Space Station-inclination orbit, eliminate the dangerous Return-to-Launch Site (RTLS) and Trans-Oceanic Abort (TAL) modes, and, by using a so-called dog-leg maneuver, fly south-to-north polar orbiting flights from Kennedy Space Center. The five-segment SRB would use a wider nozzle throat to keep within the pressure limit of the existing segment casings. After the destruction of Columbia, NASA shelved the five-segment SRB for the Shuttle Program.Jenkins, Dennis R. \\"Space Shuttle: History of the National Space Transportation System ‚Äì The First 100 Flights\\" One five-segment engineering test motor, ETM-03, was fired on October 23, 2003. As part of the Constellation Program, the first stage of the Ares I rocket was planned to use five-segment SRBs; in September 2009 a five-segment Space Shuttle SRB (DM-1) was static fired on the ground in ATK's desert testing area in Utah. Additional tests (DM-2 and DM-3) were carried out in Aug 2010 and Sept 2011.[https://phys.org/news/2011-09-nasa- successfully-five-segment-solid-rocket.html NASA successfully tests five- segment solid rocket motor Sept 2011 After the Constellation Program was cancelled in 2011, the new Space Launch System (SLS) was designated to use five-segment boosters. The first test of a SRB for SLS (QM-1) was completed in early 2015, a second test (QM-2) was performed in mid 2016 at Orbital ATK's Promontory, Utah facility. Displays Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters are on display at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Florida, the Stennis Space Center in Hancock County, Mississippi, the United States Space & Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama, and at Orbital ATK's facility near Promontory, Utah. A partial filament-wound booster case is on display at Pima Air & Space Museum in Tucson, Arizona. Future and proposed uses derived from the SRB. Over time several proposals to reuse the SRB design were presented ‚Äì however, as of 2016 none of these proposals progressed to regular flights before being cancelled. Until the 2021 planned first flight of the Space Launch System (SLS), a sole test-flight of the Ares I-X prototype in 2009 was the furthest any of these proposals progressed. =Ares= NASA initially planned to reuse the four-segment SRB design and infrastructure in several Ares rockets, which would have propelled the Orion spacecraft into orbit. In 2005, NASA announced the Shuttle-Derived Launch Vehicle slated to carry the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle into low-Earth orbit and later to the Moon. The SRB-derived Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV), named Ares I, was planned to feature a single modified 4-segment SRB for its first stage; a single liquid- fueled modified Space Shuttle Main Engine would have powered the second stage. The Ares I design updated in 2006 featured one 5-segment SRB (originally developed for the Shuttle, but never used) as a first stage; the second stage was powered by an uprated J-2X engine, derived from the J-2, which had been used in the upper stage of Saturn V and Saturn IB. In place of the standard SRB nosecone, the Ares I would have a tapered interstage assembly connecting the booster proper with the second stage, an attitude control system derived from the Regulus missile system, and larger, heavier parachutes to lower the stage into the Atlantic Ocean for recovery. Also introduced in 2005, was a heavy-lift Cargo Launch Vehicle (CaLV) named Ares V. Early designs of the Ares V utilized 5 standard-production SSMEs and a pair of 5-segment boosters identical to those proposed for the Shuttle, while later plans redesigned the boosters around the RS-68 rocket engine used on the Delta IV EELV system. Initially, NASA switched over to a system using the 5-segment boosters and a cluster of 5 RS-68s (which resulted in a widening of the Ares V core unit), then NASA reconfigured the vehicle with 6 RS-68B engines, with the boosters themselves becoming 5.5-segment boosters, with an additional half-segment to provide additional thrust at liftoff. That final redesign would have made the Ares V booster taller and more powerful than the now-retired Saturn V/INT-20, N-1, and Energia rockets, and would have allowed the Ares V to place both the Earth Departure Stage and Altair spacecraft into low-Earth orbit for later on- orbit assembly. Unlike the 5-segment SRB for the Ares I, the 5.5-segment boosters for the Ares V were to be identical in design, construction, and function to the current SRBs except for the extra segments. Like the shuttle boosters, the Ares V boosters would fly an almost-identical flight trajectory from launch to splashdown. The Constellation program, including Ares I and Ares V, was canceled in October 2010 by the passage of the 2010 NASA authorization bill. =DIRECT= The DIRECT proposal for a new, Shuttle- Derived Launch Vehicle, unlike the Ares I and Ares V boosters, uses a pair of classic 4-segment SRBs with the SSMEs used on the Shuttle. =Athena III= In 2008, PlanetSpace proposed the Athena III launch vehicle for ISS resupply flights under the COTS program; it would have featured segments from the original SRB design. =Space Launch System (SLS)= Comparison of the Saturn V, Space Shuttle, Ares I, Ares V, Ares IV, SLS Block I and SLS Block II The first versions (Blocks 1 and 1B) of the Space Launch System (SLS) are planned to use a pair of five-segment Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), which were developed from the four-segment SRBs used for the Shuttle. Modifications for the SLS included the addition of a center booster segment, new avionics, and new insulation which eliminates the Shuttle SRB's asbestos and is lighter. The five-segment SRBs provide approximately 25% more total impulse than the Shuttle SRB, and will not be recovered after use.

The series focuses on the story of a 10-year-old boy named Har√© who lives in the jungle and his misadventures with Guu, a liminal being who usually presents herself as a young girl. It was adapted into a 26-episode anime television series, followed by two OVA sequels: Har√©+Guu DELUXE and Har√©+Guu FINAL. Plot Har√©+Guu opens with a pregnant Weda leaving her home in an unnamed city. It then flashes forward to the present where Har√© is a typical boy living in an unnamed village in an unidentified jungle with his lazy mother Weda. On his way back from his errand of fetching bananas, a large dark being overtakes him. Scared, he runs back to the house where his mom has decided to have a new guest, a cute girl named Guu. The next morning, Har√© wakes up to find Guu a completely different person who is no longer cute, social, or energetic. No one seems to notice the change. Guu mostly remains quiet and ignorant of things while Har√© has to show her around and explain things. Hare notices Guu likes to eat things. She swallows Har√© but, instead of dying, he is taken to another world in Guu's stomach. There he meets Seiichi and Tomoyo, a couple who has accepted their fate in Guu's stomach. After Guu spits Har√© out, she accompanies him to school where she meets all of Har√©'s schoolmates (whom she swallows and spits back out) and the village elder (whose chest hair she rips out). The school receives a new doctor named Dr. Clive who came from the city and turns out to be Har√©'s long-lost dad. Most of the other characters start developing personalities and eccentricities of their own. Guu goes from being silent to being extremely cynical and sarcastic towards Hare and the others. She starts being more antagonistic towards Har√©. Guu starts causing shenanigans around the jungle that are meant to keep her amused (like holding a contest for Weda). She adds another resident to her stomach world, Miss Hiroko Yamada, and shows an adult form that she uses to defend Har√©. Another person who appears is Dama, a hairdresser from the next village over who obsesses over her long-lost husband with white hair that she mistakes Dr. Clive for. Bel and Asio, two servants who worked for Weda in her past life, visit the jungle. They claim that they are on vacation and wanted to see their old master. They relieve Har√© of his chores around the house and Har√© enjoys having to do less work. Guu causes more disasters around the jungle such as creating a blizzard and bringing down the wrath of Dama upon Clive. Clive finally dyes his hair black to have Dama leave him alone. Har√© finds out from Asio the circumstances behind Weda leaving her past life and why Weda is living in they jungle. Weda eventually forces Bel and Asio to tell the actual reason they came to the jungle: to bring Weda and Har√© back to the city since her father had recently died. Weda refuses at first, but relents much to Hare's chagrin. Har√©, Weda, Guu, Bel, and Asio make it to the city where they are met by Robert, a personal bodyguard hired to protect Har√© and Weda. Robert initially dislikes Weda. When Har√© and Guu are held hostage by a bank robber, Weda and Robert team up to proficiently take out the robber, safely returning Har√© and Guu. Har√© easily adjusts to luxurious life in the mansion while Weda is bored. Clive comes to the city where he finally is able to convey his feelings for Weda, ensuring them to be a couple whenever Weda returns. Guu causes more hijinks by swallowing up all the servants in a game of tag. While Har√© is running away, he runs into his long-lost grandmother Sharon. He then plans to have Weda and Sharon make up. Try as he might, all seemed lost as Weda was bored enough to want to return to the jungle much to Bel and Asio's chagrin. Fortunately, Har√© manages to knock some sense into her. Just as Weda was about to visit her mom, Sharon rides up and the two make up. Har√©, Weda, and Guu are back in the jungle with Clive now living permanently with Har√©. Har√© meets the new teacher while Lazy-Sensei was sick named Miss Yumi. Her temperament has prevented her from getting a boyfriend. She ends up falling for Har√© and harassing him for the next two arcs despite their age difference. Meanwhile, the village elder's chest hair gets so out of control he is swallowed by it enough for him to disappears for the rest of the arc. Weda announces she's pregnant and Clive decides that it is time to marry. After they marry, Har√© starts hating the idea of another sibling as he will be the one to take care of the child due to his parents' laziness. Guu takes him back to the past where he inadvertently ran into Weda. It turns out she is lazy due to the advice he gave her to be more honest with herself. He makes up a fake name while meeting Weda which Weda uses in the present to call her second child. The bank robber returns to exact his revenge on Weda for foiling him. When it looked like he was about to win, Dama shows up at the last minute to fight the bank robber. Dama ends up winning and the two eventually get married. Bel misses Weda and sends out a video letter to the jungle. Weda agrees to come back to the city to visit Bel and her mom. She drags Har√© and Guu back with her. Har√© becomes bored, so Weda enrolls him in school where he meets and instantly falls in love with Rita. Unfortunately, it works against Har√© because the school bullies get jealous of the new friendship he has formed with Rita; they bully him. Har√© finds out that he is nothing special to Rita because she likes to feel superior by being nice to everyone and not making any enemies. She is only looking out for her own self interests. Eventually, Rita sees Har√© for the friend he is and learns to care about others. Weda resolves things at home, which allows Har√© and Guu to return to the jungle. The village elder, who is basically a hairball now, is found while Hare gets help with Ame thanks to Adult Guu and the three residents in Guu's stomach. As life seems to go back to normal for Har√© (as normal as life with Guu can be), assassins hired by Weda's siblings show up to kill her because of a new discovery that Weda was included in a later version of her father's will, entitling her to a part of the family fortune. Dama returns as one of the assassins hired to kill Weda, but Robert manages to talk her into going back to life with her husband. After seven attempts onher life, Weda resolves to go to the city to bring the fight to her siblings. Weda goes to the city to settle things, and she brings all the kids from the jungle with her. They first run into trouble when two more assassins, Alex and Shirly, cause their plane to crash on an island. The two beg for their lives in front of Robert. On the island, they meet a muscle man named QP who becomes a rival to Robert and a bodyguard for Weda. When they get off the island they return to Weda's family's mansion where everyone makes plans to go to school. At school, Har√© reunites with Rita who has matured very much. So has Yohan who still has anger and hatred towards Har√©. Toposte takes over his class and becomes almost a god to the other students. He was just being controlled by his chest hair and is saved when Hare removes it. Later, Guu gets a stomachache and Har√© goes into her stomach to find the problem. He finds himself back in the RPG world where he discovers Guu has eaten the Baka Couple and Grandma Dama. She also ate Dama's sister Tama who tells them the whole story behind her and her sister. Upon returning, Har√© meets his aunt, uncle, and cousin. Weda makes up with her siblings but Har√© and his cousin, Alva, still fight. Guu is kidnapped by Har√© and Guu ‚Äî from a half year in the future ‚Äî who came to find Dama and her sister. Har√©, Guu, and their future counterparts find the two, but it is too late. They had already merged and become a giant monster, seeking to destroy the world. Har√© and Guu are able to stop the monster, and Dama makes up with her sister. The story arc ends with everyone returning to the jungle. This time, Wigle stays in the city and Alva goes with everyone. Weda returns everyone to the jungle. This time, they are bringing Har√©'s cousin Alva with them. After some heartfelt goodbyes with their classmates, the kids of the jungle return home except for Wigle who stays to attend college. At first returning, Yumi-sensei is there waiting to have a passionate reunion with Toposte, who hides from her. It gets to the point where Toposte is not safe anywhere, so he fakes an illness to keep her away. But, because Yumi-sensei offered her life for his safety, Toposte realized how she cared for him and accepted and returned her love. Alva isn't used to the jungle so he sometimes gets lost and has to be returned by a very large pokute. Later, Har√© and Guu decide to find where pokutes come from, learning that they reside in a dark cave deep in the jungle where they are also able to talk. They learn of the pokutes' relation with humans. Gupta wants to reveal his love for Ravenna but he can't get up the courage, so Guu goes with him for a practice date. This, of course, does not help at all. Then, with the urge to try to get Har√© to love her, Mari takes him around to find how love really is, where they learn the true story behind the baka couple.

He was dubbed the \\"Titanic Baby\\" for his affiliation with the RMS Titanic; Astor was born four months after his father, Colonel John Jacob Astor IV, died in the sinking of the Titanic; his pregnant mother Madeleine Astor survived the sinking. Astor was known for his legal battles with the estate of his elder half- brother, Vincent Astor, to inherit a larger portion of their father's $85 million fortune (approximately $ billion in dollars). He was also known for his many engagements and four marriages to prominent society women. Early life John Jacob Astor VI was born at 840 Fifth Avenue in New York City on August 14, 1912. He was the son of Colonel John Jacob \\"Jack\\" Astor IV (1864‚Äì1912) and socialite Madeleine Talmage Force (1893‚Äì1940). Jakey's parents' marriage, on September 9, 1911, had sparked much controversy both because of their 29-year age difference and since Colonel Astor had only previously been divorced from his first wife, socialite Ava Lowle Willing (1868‚Äì1958), one year earlier, on March 5, 1910. The newlyweds were returning home aboard the Titanic after about three months of honeymooning in Egypt and Europe. Madeleine was five months pregnant with Jakey when her husband put her in one of the ship's lifeboats. She was rescued eight hours after her husband went down with the ship. After Jack's death, Madeleine raised their son at the Astors' Newport, Rhode Island, mansion, Beechwood, as part of the Astor family. She married banker William Karl Dick (1888‚Äì1953) in 1916 and boxer Enzo Fiermonte (1908‚Äì1993) in 1933. With Dick, she had two more sons: William Force Dick (1917‚Äì1961) and John Henry Dick II (1919‚Äì1995). Fiermonte taught her sons boxing. Jakey, who had become close to Dick, strongly opposed the union with Fiermonte and repeatedly tried to convince his mother to end the relationship. This caused a rift between the two, though they reconciled within several months of the marriage. When asked if his mother was marrying Fiermonte, he responded, \\"Unfortunately, it's true\\". Jakey graduated from St. George's School in Middletown, Rhode Island and from Harvard University. Inheritance Under the terms of Colonel Astor's will, Madeleine received relatively little of her husband's $85 million estate (approximately $ billion in dollars). This included his estate in Rhinebeck and his yacht, the Noma. William Vincent Astor (1891‚Äì1959), the Colonel's son from his first marriage, received $69 million (about $ billion in dollars), while the Colonel's daughter from his first marriage, Ava Alice Muriel Astor (1902‚Äì1956), received a $10 million trust fund (about $ million in dollars). The Colonel's 19-year- old widow Madeleine received the annual income from a $5 million trust fund (about $ million in dollars), supplemented by an annual payment of $500,000 (about $ million in dollars), as well as use of his New York mansion at 65th Street & Fifth Avenue, all its furnishings, and his Newport mansion Beechwood and all of its furnishings, the pick of whichever luxury limousine she wanted from his collection, and five of his prized horses, provided that she did not remarry. While not listed by name, Jakey's father's will mentioned that any surviving child other than his children Vincent and Ava would receive a bequest of $3 million, to be held in trust until the child reached age 21. Jakey inherited the $3 million on his 21st birthday, which by that point had grown to $5 million (about $ million in dollars). When Madeleine died in late March 1940, she left him a diamond solitaire ring worth $50,000 (about $ in dollars) and a pearl necklace worth $1,525 (about $ in dollars). Elder half- brother Vincent's contempt for Madeleine led him to believe that Jakey was not even a biological Astor. Having despised his younger half-brother since birth, Vincent left him nothing in his will. Jakey felt cheated and said Vincent \\"had the legal, not the moral, right to keep all the money\\". After Vincent died childless in early February 1959, Jakey sued Vincent's widow Roberta Brooke Russell (1902‚Äî2007) for his inheritance. He was convinced that Vincent was \\"mentally incompetent\\" when signing his last will in June 1958 due to alcoholism, but Brooke insisted Vincent was \\"fully competent\\". While Vincent was hospitalized, Brooke often brought him liquor. Jakey accused her of using the liquor to influence the will in her favor. Jakey ended up settling for $250,000 (about $ million in dollars). The rest of the money remained with the Vincent Astor foundation and Brooke. Personal life Astor became engaged to Eileen Sherman Gillespie (1915‚Äì2008), the elder daughter of Lieutenant Lawrence Lewis Gillespie (1876‚Äì1940) and Irene Muriel Augusta Sherman (1887‚Äì1972), in early December 1933. Irene's parents were businessman William Watts Sherman (1842‚Äì1912) of Duncan, Sherman & Company and Sophia Augusta Brown (1867‚Äì1947). They planned to marry on February 6, 1934, but she called the wedding off on January 22 after a bitter argument. Heartbroken, Astor went to Shanghai shortly afterward to grieve, returning to America in early May 1934. He blamed her parents for interfering with the relationship. He once suggested they could reconcile, saying, \\"I was willing to marry her, and if I were to think about it, I might still be willing to marry her.\\" Eileen's daughter Marguerite \\"Margy\\" Slocum later said of him: \\"She felt that he had grown up lonely... He was a bit eccentric, and she felt he wasn't mature enough to get married.\\" A few weeks after returning from Shanghai, Astor became engaged to Eileen's close friend socialite Ellen Tuck \\"Tucky\\" French (1915‚Äì1974), the elder daughter of Francis Ormond \\"Frank\\" French II (1888‚Äì1962) and Eleanor Livingston Burrill (1891‚Äì1974). They married on June 30, 1934, at Trinity Church in Newport, Rhode Island. Tucky was a granddaughter of Amos Tuck French and a first cousin of Rhode Island Governor William Henry Vanderbilt III (1901‚Äì1981), and had been attracted to Jakey while he was engaged to Eileen. Along with Eileen's sister Phyllis, Tucky was to be a bridesmaid at Jakey and Eileen's wedding. The couple had one son before divorcing in May 1943. * William Backhouse Astor III (1935‚Äì2008), who was an investment banker. He married and later divorced Charlotte Ann Fisk (1936‚Äì2008), daughter of Earl Ellsworth Fisk and Florence Leavitt. At the time of their son's birth, Astor was working at the International Mercantile Marine Co. Another of Tucky's sisters, Virginia Middleton French (1917‚Äì2011), married William Force Dick, Astor's half-brother through his mother, on December 18, 1941, before her marriage to Philip B. Pool. The two had respectively served as matron of honor and usher to Astor and Tucky's wedding. Astor served as an usher and Tucky was matron of honor to Virginia and William's wedding. Virginia and Vincent were appointed the godparents of William Backhouse Astor III. On September 18, 1944, in New York City, Astor married for the second time, to Gertrude Gretsch (1923‚Äì1999), the daughter of Walter and Gertrude Gretsch. They divorced on August 2, 1954, after a four-year separation, though the Mexican divorce was ruled invalid in 1956. An American divorce soon followed. Before their separation and divorce, the couple had a daughter: * Mary Jacqueline \\"Jackie\\" Astor (b. 1949), who married John Rozet Drexel IV (b. 1945), a son of John Rozet Drexel III (1919‚Äì2007) and Mildred Sophia Noreen Stonor (1922‚Äì2012), in 1984. John is a 2x great-grandson of banker Anthony Joseph Drexel and a grandson of Ralph Stonor, 5th Baron Camoys. On August 6, 1954, Astor married for the third time, to Dolores Margaret \\"Dolly\\" Fullman (born c. 1928) in Arlington, Virginia. It was the 26-year-old Dolly's second marriage. They separated soon after returning from their honeymoon and divorced. Astor married his fourth and final wife, Sue Sandford, in 1956. They remained married until her death in 1985. Astor died in Miami Beach, Florida, in 1992 at the age of 79. His body was returned to New York for burial with his parents in the Trinity Church Cemetery. He was survived by his son, daughter, three grandsons, and younger half-brother. =Descendants= Through his son, Astor was a grandfather to two boys, William Backhouse Astor IV (b. 1959) and Gregory Todd Astor (b. 1966), who portrayed Colonel Astor in Titanic the Musical in April 2012. Gregory married Robin Rhodes, and they have three children: Alexandra Ellen \\"Allie\\" Astor (b. 1997), Rebecca Charlotte \\"Becca\\" Astor (b. 1998), and Stephen William Astor (b. 2002). Through his daughter, Astor was a grandfather to Nicholas Astor Drexel (b. 1988). Name confusion Even though some sources refer to Jakey as John Jacob V, John Jacob Astor, 1st Baron Astor of Hever (1886‚Äì1971) was born first and therefore is actually John Jacob Astor V. Sir Jakie Astor (1918‚Äì2000), youngest brother of David Astor, was John Jacob Astor VII; the 3rd Baron Astor of Hever is John Jacob Astor VIII. Jakey is sometimes (incorrectly) referred to as John Jacob III.

He was nominated because of his Catholicism, conservatism and lack of involvement in any of the governments that had led to the partition of the country. The short era of his presidency before the German occupation is known as the Second Czechoslovak Republic and was marked by the shift from democracy to authoritarian state with the Enabling act giving previously unusual powers to the president and government and restricting the powers of the parliament.

He dissolved the parliament, replacing it with the National Partnership. H√°cha's situation changed on 29 September 1941 when Reinhard Heydrich was appointed Deputy Protector of Bohemia and Moravia, as Neurath had been considered not harsh enough by Hitler. H√°cha lost all remaining influence over the matters in his country and became a puppet. Many of his colleagues and friends were arrested (including the Prime Minister Alois Eli√°≈°) and shot or sent to concentration camps. After the death of Heydrich, the new Deputy Protector was Kurt Daluege. Hitler had originally planned to execute 10,000 Czechs in reprisal for the murder of Heydrich and warned H√°cha that if another such incident occurred, \\"we should have to consider deporting the whole Czech population\\".Evans Third Reich at War p. 277 This threat was made at Heydrich's funeral.Mazower Hitler's Empire p. 213 On 9 May 1945, Prague was liberated by the Red Army during the Prague Offensive.

Launched in 1991, it offered coverage of local affairs, social issues as well as entertainment listings. The 1000th issue was published in 2013, the same year that it was sold to the South China Morning Post (SCMP) group. The magazine printed its final issue on 7 October 2016. This was the third SCMP subsidiary to close since the takeover of the newspaper by the Alibaba Group. History HK Magazine was founded by best friends Greg Duncan, Stephen Freeman and Gretchen Worth. In 1989, considering Hong Kong a suitable place to start a magazine, they decided to establish an English-language publication. The first issue, called HK: the indispensable Hong Kong Guide, was published in June 1991 by the local private company Asia City Publishing Limited. It had 24 pages and claimed a circulation of 15,000. It continued to publish on a monthly basis until November 1992, when because of the ambiguity of the name and the change of the publisher's schedule, the magazine was renamed HK Magazine, and switched to a bi-weekly schedule for the next three years. In September 1995, it became a weekly magazine. On 27 March 2009, the magazine allowed the publication of an article from its columnist, writer Chip Tsao. His article War at Home alleges the Philippines to be a nation of servants and also claims China is the master. This triggered a massive outcry from the Filipino community in Hong Kong and outraged many across the Philippines. Tsao made a public apology three days later on 30 March 2009. In 2013, it was reported that Asia City Media Group had sold its Hong Kong business, including HK Magazine and other titles, to South China Morning Post for a sum of HK$13 million. South China Morning Post, including HK Magazine, was sold to Alibaba Group in early 2016. Distribution The magazine, which was audited by the Audit Bureau of Circulations, was free at around 900 venues including restaurants, bars, coffee shops, bookshops and retail stores. The distribution outlets were mostly concentrated in commercial business districts. Readership The magazine claimed around 236,000 readers per week. According to a survey conducted by HK Magazine in 2004, 87% of the readers were holders of at least one university degree and 75% earned more than HK$30,000 per month. (Source: HK Magazine 2004 Readership Survey, HK Magazine 2004 Distribution Survey).

Established on 10 February 1989 in Hong Kong, it produces a portfolio of free city living publications. Formerly known as Lucky Still Limited, the corporation changed its name to Asia City Publishing Limited on 23 May 1989; it underwent another name change to become Asia City Media Group in the 2000s. In 2013 it was acquired by South China Morning Post and named HK Magazine Media Group. It introduces new lifestyle to readers in different regions through an extensive portfolio of publications.

Closure On 28 September 2016 The South China Morning Post announced that the magazine's final issue would be released on 7 October 2016. This was the third SCMP subsidiary to close since the Alibaba Group takeover of the newspaper in early 2016, the first two being the 48 HOURS weekend magazine and the SCMP Chinese language edition. SCMP stated that some HK Magazine staff members might be reassigned within the SCMP group while \\"around five\\" may be laid off. The closure of the magazine was mourned in Hong Kong as the loss of a \\"fun, independent and free-thinking\\" publication that blended entertainment listings with coverage of social and issues, such as Hong Kong's relationship with mainland China and LGBT rights. SCMP's decision to discontinue the publication has been viewed as part of a wider effort under Alibaba management to shift focus away from Hong Kong and onto mainland China, and to market that coverage to western readers overseas. The Alibaba acquisition of the newspaper aims to promote China in the west, with the group's executive vice chairman stating that foreigners \\"don‚Äôt really understand China and have the wrong perception of China\\". It has been noted that the Post, once famed for pursuing stories banned in mainland China, has become \\"markedly less critical of Beijing\\" in recent years. Zach Hines, who worked at the magazine from 2005‚Äì2015 (serving as editor-in-chief from 2008), wrote of the closure: > \\"The South China Morning Post purchased us at the right time, and for > sensible reasons. The media landscape was changing dramatically, as it > continues to do, and their ownership bought us a few final years of life. > But, like ‚ÄúOne Country, Two Systems,‚Äù this odd and uncomfortable marriage > was never going to last. To be a truly independent press, you cannot be > beholden to anyone except your readers. But, to my great dismay, this is > becoming an increasing impossibility in Hong Kong, in both the mainstream > Chinese and much-smaller English media. The SCMP itself is now owned by > Alibaba, perhaps the biggest pro-China organization in the world, if you > don‚Äôt count the Communist Party. The paper‚Äôs business interests are also > drifting away from Hong Kong, and toward readers in the United States and > the rest of the west. HK Magazine is a canary in the coal mine. [...] As > this sad end to HK Magazine shows, it is clear that it is time now for > someone else to step up and provide an alternative voice for Hong Kong. If > you care about free speech and the liberal values that make Hong Kong what > it is, say something about it. Do something about it. Support independent > outlets like Hong Kong Free Press and FactWire. You have a voice. Use it. Or > you will surely lose it.\\" Initially SCMP stated that the HK Magazine website would be deleted from the internet. This received strong condemnation. The Hong Kong Journalists Association lodged an inquiry with SCMP management. Hines stated: \\"It is unthinkable that a newspaper of record would ever consider deleting content from its archive. The SCMP should be held to proper journalistic standards. HK Magazine was an important feature of Hong Kong‚Äôs media landscape, and it must be preserved. Deleting it would be an utter travesty of journalistic principles ‚Äì and a slap in the face to SCMP‚Äôs readers and to Hong Kong society in general.\\" Following the negative reaction SCMP stated that HK Magazine content would be migrated to the South China Morning Post website before the HK Magazine website was deleted. Additionally, Hong Kong data scientist Mart van de Ven launched a public appeal to help archive back issues of the magazine, expressing doubt that SCMP would preserve the full archive. He found that he was unable to access issue 1,103, which featured Leung Chun-ying on the cover. An archive of HK Magazine's website just before closure is available at https://hkmag-archive.com/.

(; November 10, 1801 ‚Äì September 22, 1872) was one of the greatest Russian-language lexicographers and a founding member of the Russian Geographical Society. He knew at least six languages, including Turkic, and is considered one of the early Turkologists. During his lifetime he compiled and documented the oral history of the region that was later published in Russian and became part of modern folklore. Early life Vladimir Dal's father was a Danish physician named Johan Christian von Dahl (1764 ‚Äì October 21, 1821), a linguist versed in the German, English, French, Russian, Yiddish, Latin, Greek and Hebrew languages. His mother, Julia Adelaide Freytag, was of German and probably French (Huguenot) descent. She spoke at least five languages and came from a family of scholars. The prospective lexicographer was born in the town of Lugansky Zavod, in Novorossiya under the jurisdiction of Yekaterinoslav Governorate, part of the Russian Empire (present-day Luhansk, Ukraine). The settlement of Lugansky Zavod had been established in 1795. Dal's house and museum in Luhansk, Ukraine. Novorossiya, colonized by the Russian Empire in the 18th century, had Russian imposed as a common language in cities, but Ukrainian remained prevalent in smaller towns, villages, and rural areas outside the immediate control of colonization. On the outskirts, the ethnic composition varied and included such nationalities as Ukrainians, Greeks, Bulgarians, Armenians, Tatars, and many others. Dal grew up under the influence of this varied ethnic mixture of people and cultures. Dal served in the Russian Navy from 1814 to 1826, graduating from the Saint Petersburg Naval Cadet School in 1819. In 1826 he began studying medicine at Dorpat University and participated as a military doctor in the Russo-Turkish War (1828‚Äì1829) and in the campaign against Poland in 1831‚Äì1832. Following disagreement with his superiors, he resigned from the Military Hospital in Saint Petersburg and took an administrative position with the Ministry of the Interior in Orenburg Governorate in 1833. He took part in General Perovsky's military expedition against Khiva of 1839-1840. Dal then served in administrative positions in Saint Petersburg (1841-1849) and in Nizhny Novgorod (1849- ) before his retirement in 1859. Dal had an interest in language and folklore from his early years. He started traveling by foot through the countryside, collecting sayings and fairy tales in various Slavic languages from the region. He published his first collection of fairy-tales () in 1832. Some others, yet unpublished, were put in verse by his friend Alexander Pushkin (1799-1837) and have become some of the most familiar texts in the Russian language. After Pushkin's fatal duel in January 1837, Dal was summoned to his deathbed and looked after the great poet during the last hours of his life. In 1838 Dal was elected to the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Lexicographic studies In the following decade, Dal adopted the pen name Kazak Lugansky (\\"Cossack from Luhansk\\") and published several realistic essays in the manner of Nikolai Gogol. He continued his lexicographic studies and extensive travels throughout the 1850s and 1860s. Having no time to edit his collection of fairy tales, he asked Alexander Afanasyev to prepare them for publication, which followed in the late 1850s. Joachim T. Baer wrote: > While Dal was a skilled observer, he lacked talent in developing a story and > creating psychological depth for his characters. He was interested in the > wealth of the Russian language, and he began collecting words while still a > student in the Naval Cadet School. Later he collected and recorded fairy > tales, folk songs, birch bark woodcuts, and accounts of superstitions, > beliefs, and prejudices of the Russian people. His industry in the sphere of > collecting was prodigious.Terras, Handbook of Russian Literature, p. 92. His magnum opus, Explanatory Dictionary of the Live Great Russian language, was published in four huge volumes in 1863‚Äì1866. The Sayings and Bywords of the Russian people, featuring more than 30,000 entries, followed several years later. Both books have been reprinted innumerable number of times. Baer says: \\"While an excellent collector, Dal had some difficulty ordering his material, and his so-called alphabet-nest system was not completely satisfactory until Baudouin de Courtenay revised it thoroughly in the third (1903‚Äì1910) and fourth (1912‚Äì1914) editions of the Dictionary.\\" Dal was a strong proponent of the native rather than adopted vocabulary. His dictionary began to have a strong influence on literature at the beginning of the 20th century; in his 1911 article \\"Poety russkogo sklada\\" (Poets of the Russian Mold), Maximilian Voloshin wrote: > Just about the first of the contemporary poets who began to read Dal was > Vyacheslav Ivanov. In any case, contemporary poets of the younger > generation, under his influence, subscribed to the new edition of Dal.

While studying at Cambridge, Vladimir Nabokov bought a copy of Dal's dictionary and read at least ten pages every evening, \\"jotting down such words and expressions as might especially please me\\"; Alexander Solzhenitsyn took a volume of Dal with him as his only book when he was sent to the prison camp at Ekibastuz.Brian Boyd, Vladimir Nabokov: The Russian Years (Princeton University Press, 1993), p. 171. The encompassing nature of Dal's dictionary gives it critical linguistic importance even today, especially because a large proportion of the dialectal vocabulary he collected has since passed out of use. The dictionary served as a base for Vasmer's Etymological dictionary of the Russian language, the most comprehensive Slavic etymological lexicon. For his great dictionary Dal was honoured by the Lomonosov Medal, the Constantine Medal (1863) and an honorary fellowship in the Russian Academy of Sciences. He is interred at the Vagankovskoye Cemetery in Moscow. To mark the 200th anniversary of Vladimir Dal's birthday, UNESCO declared the year 2000 The International Year of Vladimir Dal.

His responsibilities included overseeing investigations of murders of children in the western part of Russia. In 1840, the Damascus Affair had revived the medieval blood libel canard in Europe (the anti-Semitic accusation that Jews use the blood of Christian children for ritual purposes), and Czar Nicholas I instructed his officials, especially Vladimir Dal, to thoroughly investigate the legend. In 1844, just 10 copies of a 100-page report, intended only for the czar and senior officials, were submitted. The paper was entitled \\"Investigation on the Murder of Christian Children by the Jews and the Use of Their Blood.\\" It was claimed there that although the vast majority of Jews had not even heard of ritual murder, it and the use of blood for magical purposes were committed by sects of fanatical Hasidic Jews.Poliakov, L√©on. The History of Anti-Semitism: Suicidal Europe, 1870‚Äì1933. University of Pennsylvania Press. 2003. p.84. While the paper is often attributed to Dal, the question of the authorship (or multiple authorships) remains controversial. In 1914, 42 years after Dal's death, during the blood libel trial of Menahem Mendel Beilis in Kyiv, the then 70-year-old report was published in St. Petersburg under the title Notes on Ritual Murders. The name of the author was not stated on this new edition, intended for the general public.L√©on Poliakov. The History of Anti-Semitism: Suicidal Europe, 1870‚Äì1933.

There was a strong influence from the customs and languages of Islamic societies, notably Arabic, while Persian culture had a significant contribution through the heavily Persianized Seljuq Turks, the Ottomans' predecessors. Despite newer added amalgamations, the Ottoman dynasty, like their predecessors in the Sultanate of Rum and the Seljuk Empire, were thoroughly Persianised in their culture, language, habits and customs, and therefore, the empire has been described as a Persianate empire.\\" Throughout its history, the Ottoman Empire had substantial subject populations of Orthodox subjects, Armenians, Jews and Assyrians, who were allowed a certain amount of autonomy under the confessional millet system of Ottoman government, and whose distinctive cultures enriched that of the Ottoman state. As the Ottoman Empire expanded it assimilated the culture of numerous regions under its rule and beyond, being particularly influenced by Byzantium, the Arab culture of the Islamic Middle East, and the Persian culture of Iran.  Literature  Reconstruction of an Ottoman style library, in the Topkapƒ± Palace museum = Poetry = As with many Ottoman Turkish art forms, the poetry produced for the Ottoman court circle had a strong influence from classical Persian traditions; a large number of Persian loanwords entered the literary language, and Persian metres and forms (such as those of Ghazal) were used. By the 19th century and the era of Tanzimat reforms, the influence of Turkish folk literature, until then largely oral, began to appear in Turkish poetry, and there was increasing influence from the literature of Europe; there was a corresponding decline in classical court poetry. Tevfik Fikret, born in 1867, is often considered the founder of modern Turkish poetry. =Prose= Prior to the 19th century, Ottoman prose was exclusively non-fictional, and was much less highly developed than Ottoman poetry, in part because much of it followed the rules of the originally Arabic tradition of rhymed prose (Saj'). Nevertheless, a number of genres - the travelogue, the political treatise and biography - were current. From the 19th century, the increasing influence of the European novel, and particularly that of the French novel, began to be felt. ≈ûemsettin Sami's Taa≈üuk-u Tal'at ve Fitnat, widely considered the first Turkish novel, was published in 1872; other notable Ottoman writers of prose were Ahmet Mithat and Halit Ziya U≈üaklƒ±gil.  Architecture  Ottoman architecture was a synthesis of Iranian-influenced Seljuk architectural traditions, as seen in the buildings of Konya, Mamluk architecture, and Byzantine architecture; it reached its greatest development in the large public buildings, such as mosques and caravanserais, of the 16th century. The most significant figure in the field, the 16th-century architect and engineer Mimar Sinan, was a Muslim convert of Armenian descent, having a background in the Janissaries. His most famous works were the Selimiye Mosque in Edirne and the Suleiman Mosque in Constantinople. One of his pupils, Sedefkar Mehmed Agha, designed the early 17th century Blue Mosque, considered the last great building of classical Ottoman architecture. Decorative arts =Calligraphy= The stylized signature of Sultan Mahmud II of the Ottoman Empire was written in an expressive calligraphy. It reads Mahmud Khan son of Abd√ºlhamid is forever victorious. Calligraphy had a prestigious status under the Ottomans, its traditions having been shaped by the work of Abbasid calligrapher Yaqut al- Musta'simi of Baghdad, whose influence had spread across the Islamic world, al-Musta'simi himself possibly being of Anatolian origin. The Diwani script is a cursive and distinctively Ottoman style of Arabic calligraphy developed in the 16th and early 17th centuries. It was invented by Housam Roumi, reaching its greatest development under S√ºleyman I the Magnificent (1520‚Äì66). The highly decorative script was distinguished by its complexity of line and by the close juxtaposition of the letters within words. Other forms included the flowing, rounded Nashki script, invented by the 10th-century Abbasid calligrapher Ali Muhammad ibn Muqlah, and Ta'liq, based on the Persian Nastalƒ´q style. Noted Ottoman calligraphers include Seyyid Kasim Gubari, ≈ûeyh Hamdullah, Ahmed Karahisari, and H√¢fiz Osman. =Miniatures= The Ottoman tradition of painting miniatures, to illustrate manuscripts or used in dedicated albums, was heavily influenced by the Persian art form, though it also included elements of the Byzantine tradition of illumination and painting. A Greek academy of painters, the Nakkashane-i-Rum was established in the Topkapi Palace in the 15th century, while early in the following century a similar Persian academy, the Nakkashane-i-Irani, was added. Iznik Tile, Ottoman Empire, in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. =Carpet-weaving and textile arts= 17th-century Ottoman velvet cushion cover, with stylized carnation motifs. Floral motifs were common in Ottoman art. The art of carpet weaving was particularly significant in the Ottoman Empire, carpets having an immense importance both as decorative furnishings, rich in religious and other symbolism, and as a practical consideration, as it was customary to remove one's shoes in living quarters.Foroqhi, S. Subjects of the Sultan: Culture and Daily Life in the Ottoman Empire, I. B. Tauris, 2005, , p. 152 The weaving of such carpets originated in the nomadic cultures of central Asia (carpets being an easily transportable form of furnishing), and was eventually spread to the settled societies of Anatolia. Turks used carpets, rugs and patterned kilims not just on the floors of a room, but also as a hanging on walls and doorways, where they provided additional insulation. They were also commonly donated to mosques, which often amassed large collections of them.Foroqhi, p.153 Hereke carpets were of particularly high status, being made of silk or a combination of silk and cotton, and intricately knotted. Other significant designs included \\"Palace\\", \\"Y√∂r√ºk\\", Ushak, and Milas or \\"T√ºrkmen\\" carpets. \\"Y√∂r√ºk\\" and \\"T√ºrkmen\\" represented more stylized designs, whereas naturalistic designs were prevalent in \\"Palace\\". = Jewelry = The Ottoman Empire was noted for the quality of its gold- and silversmiths, and particularly for the jewelry they produced. Jewelry had particular importance as it was commonly given at weddings, as a gift that could be used as a form of savings.Foroqhi, p.108 Silver was the most common material used, with gold reserved for more high-status pieces; designs often displayed complex filigree work and incorporated Persian and Byzantine motifs. Developments in design reflected the tastes of the Ottoman court, with Persian Safavid art, for example, becoming an influence after the Ottoman defeat of Ismail I after the Battle of Chaldiran in 1514.Newman, A. (ed) Society and Culture in the Early Modern Middle East, BRILL, 2003, , p.177 In the rural areas of the Empire, jewelry was simpler and often incorporated gold coins (the Ottoman altin), but the designs of Constantinople nevertheless spread throughout Ottoman territory and were reflected even in the metalwork of Egypt and North Africa. Most jewelers and goldsmiths were Christian Armenians and Jews, but the interest of the Ottomans in the related art of watchmaking resulted in many European goldsmiths, watchmakers and gem engravers moving to Constantinople, where they worked in the foreigners' quarter, Galata.G√∂√ßek, F. East encounters West: France and the Ottoman Empire in the Eighteenth Century, OUP, 1987, , p.106  Performance  Musicians and dancers entertain the crowds, from Surname-i H√ºmayun, 1720. = Music = Apart from the music traditions of its constituent peoples, the Ottoman Empire evolved a distinct style of court music, Ottoman classical music. This was a principally vocal form, with instrumental accompaniment, built on makamlar, a set of melodic systems, with a corresponding set of rhythmic patterns called usul. Another distinctive feature of Ottoman music were the mehter√¢n, the military bands used by the Janissaries and in the retinues of high-ranking officials. These bands were the ancestors of modern military bands, as well as of the brass ensembles popular in traditional Balkan music. = Dance = Dancing was an important element of Ottoman culture, which incorporated the folkloric dancing traditions of many different countries and lands on three continents; from the Balkan peninsula and the Black Sea regions to the Caucasus, the Middle East and North Africa. Dancing was also one of the most popular pastimes in the Harem of Topkapƒ± Palace. The female belly dancers, named √áengi, were mostly from the Roma community. Today, living in Istanbul's Roma neighbourhoods like Sulukule, Ku≈ütepe, Cennet and Kasƒ±mpa≈üa, they still dominate the traditional belly dancing and musical entertainment shows throughout the city's traditional taverns. There were also male dancers, named K√∂√ßek, who took part in the entertainment shows and celebrations, accompanied by circus acrobats, named Cambaz, performing difficult tricks, and other shows which attracted curiosity. = Meddah (one person show) = Meddah performing at a coffeehouse The meddah or story teller played in front of a small group of viewers, such as a coffeehouse audience. The play was generally about a single topic, the meddah playing different characters, and was usually introduced by drawing attention to the moral contained in the story. The meddah would use props such as an umbrella, a handkerchief, or different headwear, to signal a change of character, and was skilled at manipulating his voice and imitating different dialects. There was no time limitation on the shows; a good meddah had the skill to adjust the story depending on interaction with the audience. Meddahs were generally traveling artists whose route took them from one large city to another, such along the towns of the spice road; the tradition supposedly goes back to Homer's time. The methods of meddahs were the same as the methods of the itinerant storytellers who related Greek epics such as the Iliad and Odyssey, even though the main stories were now Ferhat ile ≈ûirin or Layla and Majnun. The repertoires of the meddahs also included true stories, modified depending on the audience, artist and political situation. The Istanbul meddahs were known to integrate musical instruments into their stories: this was a main difference between them and the East Anatolian Dengbejin. In 2008 the art of the meddahs was relisted in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. = Karag√∂z (shadow play) = Shadow Play: Hacivat (left) and Karag√∂z (right) The Turkish shadow theatre, also known as Karag√∂z (\\"Black-Eyed\\") after one of its main characters, is descended from the Oriental Shadow theatre. Today, scholars generally consider the technique of a single puppeteer creating voices for a dialogue, narrating a story, and possibly even singing, all while manipulating puppets, to be an Indonesian invention. = Median (open stage show) = Median  Sports  Sports Clubs in the Ottoman Empire The Jewish Gymnastics Club of Constantinople, founded in 1895, was the first of Istanbul‚Äôs sports clubs, soon followed by Kurtulu≈ü Sports Club founded in 1896 by Ottoman Greeks.Murat Cihan Yildiz, \\"Strengthening Male Bodies and Building Robust Communities: Physical Culture in the Late Ottoman Empire\\" (Phd Dissertation, UCLA, 2015), April 2014, 1,76 , accessed March 1, 2018, https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt4mw253hf/qt4mw253hf.pdf?t=nu5x8u&v;=lg. The opening of these athletic clubs symbolized a general growth in sports and sports culture in Istanbul at the time. In the coming years, Be≈üikta≈ü Gymnastics Club, the Galatasaray Sports Club, and the Fenerbah√ße Sports Club ‚Äî Istanbul‚Äôs ‚Äúbig three‚Äù ‚Äî were founded.Ibid, 2. Exercise, as well as football and gymnastics were commonplace among the primarily affluent members of these clubs. In contrast to the fairly exclusive ‚Äúbig three‚Äù, Vefa Sports Club, established after the progressive Young Turk revolution in 1908, served as an amateur sports and football club of the people. The turn of the twentieth century saw clubs spring up throughout Istanbul to appeal to many niches of young men, whether Muslim, Christian, or Jewish.Ibid, 26. Almost all athletic clubs were ethnically and religiously homogeneous, however they all shared a focus on physicality.Ibid, 70. Furthermore, the function of these institutions expanded beyond sports, as they taught young men proper hygiene, dress, and posture, in addition to serving as environments for male discourse and socializing. The development of athletic clubs enabled the rise of team sports in Istanbul ‚Äî principally football ‚Äî serving as contrasts to the more traditional Ottoman sports of oil wrestling and archery.Ibid, 58. For instance, upon its opening in 1905, Galatasaray functioned exclusively as a football club.Ibid, 103. This shift toward team competition represented a general modernization of sports in Istanbul, a modernization that can also be seen, for example, in the Be≈üikta≈ü Gymnastics Club as traditional Turkish wrestling embraced new mat technology.Krawietz, Birgit. The Sportification and Heritagisation of Traditional Turkish Oil Wrestling. The International Journal of the History of Sport, volume 29, issue 15. October 2012. Pg 2149. Athletic clubs revolutionized sports reporting in the Ottoman Empire, as publications began to cover club games.Ibid, Yildiz, 160-161. Futbol, written in Ottoman Turkish and initially released in 1910, served as Istanbul‚Äôs first sports magazine, principally following club football matches.Ibid, 154. Growth in sports related readership coincided with a growing sports spectating culture in Istanbul. 1905 saw the creation of the Constantinople Association Football League, which organized soccer matches among athletic clubs, while also providing entertainment for thousands of spectators.Ibid, 211. Completed in 1909, with the blessing of Sultan Abd√ºlhamid II, the Union Club provided the first reliable stadium in which thousands of Istanbul spectators could gather to watch sports.Ibid, 213. Contrary to the strict homosocial exclusivity of many clubs, the Union Club allowed women to spectate athletic competitions.Ibid, 214-215. With this rise in spectatorship, Galatasaray and Fenerbah√ße in particular, became recognized as the city‚Äôs preeminent clubs.Ali Sami, ‚ÄúGalatasaray Kul√ºb√ºn√ºn Tarih√ßesi,‚Äù ƒ∞dman (May 28, 1913), p. 9; Mehmet Nasuhi, ‚ÄúFenerbah√ße Spor Kul√ºb√º Tarih√ßesi,‚Äù ƒ∞dman (June 28, 1913), pp. 46-47. While heavily connected to football, the Union Club hosted a plethora events organized by a variety of Istanbul athletic clubs, including races, gymnastics, and more. For example, in 1911, the Union Club was the site of the first Armenian Olympics.Ibid, Yildiz, 227. In the past century, many of these clubs have only continued to gain popularity. Now under the Republic of Turkey, the S√ºper Lig represents the region‚Äôs most popular football league, and Galatasaray and Fenerbah√ße are the league‚Äôs most popular teams.  Ottoman cuisine  Coffee delight at the Harem The cuisine of Ottoman Turkey can be divided between that of the Ottoman court itself, which was a highly sophisticated and elaborate fusion of many of the culinary traditions found in the Empire, and the regional cuisines of the peasantry and of the Empire's minorities, which were influenced by the produce of their respective areas. Rice, for example, was a staple of high-status cookery (Imperial cooks were hired according to the skill they displayed in cooking it) but would have been regarded as a luxury item through most of Anatolia, where bread was the staple grain food. =Drinks= * Turkish Coffee - probably introduced from Levantine Arabic culture, coffee became central to Ottoman society - often accompanied with a Nargile (Narguile / Hookkah). * Ayran - a traditional yogurt drink still popular throughout many areas of the former Empire. * Sherbet - a spiced cold fruit drink. * Rakƒ± - a traditional Turkish alcoholic beverage. =Food= * Lokum (Turkish Delight) * ≈ûeker (Candies) ** Akide ≈ûekeri * Macun (Majoon) * Pestil * Sucuk * Shish Kebab * √á√∂rek * Baklava * Lahmacun * D√∂ner * Kebab  Science and technology  = Timeline = ¬∑ establishment of the Imperial Naval Engineering College in 1773 * October 22, 1784 - Imperial Naval Engineering school * Military Academy founded 1834 * Imperial School of Music founded 1836 * April 1, 1847 - Institution of the Ministry of Education founded * July 18, 1851 - Inauguration of the Academy of Sciences * Civil Service School founded 1859 * Imperial Ottoman Lyc√©e of Galatasaray founded 1868 Gallery File:Fausto Zonaro - Amusement at G√∂ksu - Google Art Project.jpgBoat tour at G√∂ksu Creek File:Franz Hermann, Hans Gemminger, Valentin Mueller - A Scene from the Turkish Harem - Google Art Project.jpgWomen and children dancing in the Harem of Topkapƒ± Palace File:Pierre D√©sir√© Guillemet - Portrait of a Lady of the Court Playing the Tambourine - Google Art Project.jpgA lady from the Ottoman court playing the Def at the Harem File:Tile with Floral and Cloud-band Design MET DP170362.jpgTile with floral and Cloud-band design, c.1578, Iznik Tile, Ottoman Empire, in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

In: ft.com, December 7, 2018. broadcaster, DJ and record label owner. He has founded influential labels such as Acid Jazz and Talkin' Loud, and started his current label, Brownswood Recordings, in 2006. He was awarded an honorary MBE in 2004, the AIM Award for Indie Champion 2013, the Mixmag Award for Outstanding Contribution To Dance Music in 2013, the PRS for Music Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music Radio in 2014, and The A&R; Award from The Music Producers Guild in 2019. Throughout his career, Peterson has played a pivotal role in promoting genres such as jazz, hip-hop, and electronic music. He started his career on pirate radio stations Radio Invicta and K-Jazz, later joining legal stations in London, first the newly-founded Jazz FM, and then onto the dance music station Kiss FM. In 1998, he was hired by BBC Radio 1, and in 2012 he began hosting a three-hour Saturday afternoon programme on BBC Radio 6 Music. He hosts a syndicated radio programme that is broadcast in seven European countries. In 2016, he launched the online radio station Worldwide FM with Boiler Room co-founder and original host Thristian Richards. He also hosts mixes and new music on his SoundCloud page, where he has over three million followers. He is behind several events celebrating the music that he supports through his DJ sets and radio shows. Since 2005, he has hosted the annual Worldwide Awards in London and Worldwide Festival in S√®te. In 2019, launched the new We Out Here festival in the UK.  Career  = Radio = Peterson was first heard as a DJ on the London pirate radio station Radio Invicta, Peterson spent his teenage years putting up radio transmitters for the pirates and playing on stations such as K-Jazz. Brought up in Suburban South London soul scene Peterson was exposed to variety of music. He went on to host Mad On Jazz on BBC Radio London in 1986‚Äì87, and became known on the London circuit as a DJ specialising in the new breed of \\"acid jazz\\", drawing on the jazz, funk, Latin fusions and Brazilian music of the 1970s. In March 1990, Peterson joined London's first-ever dedicated jazz station 102.2 Jazz FM at its launch. The three-hour show was stripped into sections including the \\"Samba 60\\" and the \\"Vibrazone\\". Artists as diverse as the Freestyle Fellowship, S√©rgio Mendes and Leon Thomas would all appear on the same playlist. He was dismissed from the station after playing anti-war songs and making anti-war comments during the first Gulf War. Peterson would then join Kiss FM in 1991, the station having become legal the year before. In his \\"Vibrazone\\" shows on Kiss FM he played acts as diverse as Josh Wink, Gang Starr and Horace Silver in the space of a single programme. Features included the \\"Herbie Sessions\\". From 1998 to 2012, through his BBC show Worldwide - which was originally produced by longtime collaborator Benji B, Karen P (Folded Wing), Ben Cave, Beccy Grierson, Alex Kenning, and Dave O'Donnell - Peterson continued to present a wide range of music that may be new to its young audiences. The show always presented a combination of new, older and often very rare records from the late 1950s to 1980s. Every three months or so, Peterson dedicated a whole show to older vinyl releases in a special version of his show he subtitled as Brownswood Basement; two associated compilation albums with the same name containing older personal classics have been released on the United States label Ubiquity Records's offshoot Luv N' Haight. In August 2004, the show moved from Wednesday (midnight till 2am) to an earlier Sunday slot (11pm to 1am), with a spectacular live outside broadcast from The Big Chill at Eastnor Castle Herefordshire, featuring Bugz In The Attic performing a DJ set, and interviews with house DJ Tom Middleton and Mr. Scruff. One of the highlights of the changed format BBC Radio 1 show was the special sessions from the BBC's Maida Vale Studios. These included artists such as Roots Manuva, Bj√∂rk and Floating Points. In September 2006, the show was moved from Sunday night to Tuesday night/Wednesday morning between 2am and 4am. The first show included a live appearance from Lupe Fiasco. In late 2011, Peterson announced that after 13 years at the station he would be leaving BBC Radio 1, following his last show in the early hours of Wednesday 28 March and moving to a new show on BBC Radio 6 Music. Peterson started a new three-hour Saturday afternoon show on BBC Radio 6 Music, beginning on Saturday 7 April 2012, running weekly from 3 to 6pm, and giving him an extra hour of broadcast time. Like his previous Radio 1 programme, it is made by independent production company Somethin' Else for the BBC. A new global music-radio platform named Worldwide FM was launched by Gilles Peterson with Boiler Room co-founder Thristian Richards in September 2016. Following the success of the Grand Theft Auto V in-game radio station of the same name, WorldWide FM has expanded into the real world with Peterson and Richards hosting shows alongside a hand-picked roster of the finest DJs and selectors from five continents. Since the launch, the station has gone out on the road broadcasting across Europe, the US and Asia, with pop-ups in Amsterdam (ADE), Los Angeles (How We Do LA), Marseille (Le Gallette), Milan (Jazzmi Festival), Paris (Le Mellotron), Tokyo (HMV Shibuya), and closer to home, at the 1:54 Contemporary African Art Fair (Somerset House). The station is Powered by WeTransfer and broadcasting from The Pyramid radio studios in north London. = Clubs = Upon leaving BBC London in 1987, Peterson took up a new Sunday afternoon residency at Dingwalls in Camden. It was around the same time that he'd started BGP Records, a sub-label of Ace Records focused on soul, funk and jazz dance, together with DJ Baz Fe Jazz. Playing alongside fellow London DJ Patrick Forge, the night, dubbed Talkin' Loud And Sayin' Something, ran for five years. It coincided with the rise of acid house in UK clubland and would grow to establish itself as a legendary session. The sessions were characterised by jazz dancers in suits, hats and spats, well-known jazz dance classics including tracks from Yusef Lateef, Pharoah Sanders, Freddie Hubbard, Airto, Herbie Hancock, and the anthemic In The Fast Lane by Jean-Luc Ponty; but the jazz was fused with hip-hop and the more experimental tracks. On 8 October 2006, both Peterson and Forge played the first of many annual reunion shows at the old site of Dingwalls (now a Jongleurs comedy club), with a compilation album of popular tracks from the club also being released at the same time in 2006 entitled Sunday Afternoon At Dingwalls. This was just one among many other significant clubs with which Peterson was associated: Special Branch, Electric Ballroom, Wag Club, Babylon at Heaven, Fez, Talkin Loud at the Fridge, That's How It Is at Bar Rumba and his long association with Plastic People. It was at a Special Branch show, with fellow DJ Chris Bangs, that the term \\"acid jazz\\" was coined, starting as an in-joke. At the time, acid house was in the ascendant, and at one of the shows Bangs played a rare groove record, grabbed the mic and shouted: ‚ÄúFuck that, if that was acid house, this is acid jazz!‚Äù. In 1988, Peterson and Eddie Piller founded Acid Jazz Records, a label whose roster included the Brand New Heavies, Jamiroquai, Corduroy, the James Taylor Quartet and Snowboy. = Record labels = In 1990, Peterson founded record label Talkin' Loud, enlisting the help of fellow DJ Norman Jay, who formed his own Global Village label. The Talkin' Loud roster included Nuyorican Soul (a side project of the producers Masters At Work), Courtney Pine, MJ Cole, Young Disciples, Incognito, Terry Callier, The Roots, Galliano and Roni Size's project Reprazent. The first release from Talkin' Loud was a self-titled compilation in 1990 featuring artists Galliano, Jalal of the Last Poets, Incognito, Young Disciples, Wild & Peaceful, and Ace of Clubs. The label saw five of its artists nominated for the Mercury Music Prize, with Roni Size's Reprazent winning the award in 1997 for the album New Forms. The iconic Talkin' Loud logo was created by Ian Swift (Swifty) who also designed the magazine Straight No Chaser. Released in May 2014, the Sonzeira Brasil Bam Bam Bam album saw the Talkin' Loud imprint revived in partnership with Virgin EMI. The record is a journey through the different flavours of authentic Brazilian music culture. Sonzeira is the collective name for the group of Brazilian artists who feature on the album. Peterson turned from DJ to producer for this ambitious venture, settling in Rio de Janeiro with young UK production associates Sam Shepherd (Floating Points); Dilip Harris and Rob Gallagher from 2 Banks of 4; and Kassin from Rio collective Orquestra Imperial. The album features Brazilian artists such as Seu Jorge and Elza Soares. Along with the album, there was a documentary film celebrating the creation and release of ‚ÄúSonzeira: Brasil Bam Bam Bam\\". Titled ‚ÄúBam Bam Bam: The Story of Sonzeira‚Äù, this two-hour documentary was directed by Charlie Inman and Ben Holman and shot in 2014 by Mother London and Rio de Janeiro's Beija Films. The film was also distributed in Tokyo, Japan by Sha-la-la Company and raised money for Fight For Peace (Luta Pela Paz), organisation founded in Complexo da Mar√©, Rio de Janeiro, as a direct response to youth- involvement in drug-related crime and violence. Peterson's current record label, Brownswood Recordings, was launched in 2006. The label's early releases includes the likes of British singer/songwriter Ben Westbeech, 45-piece orchestral ensemble The Heritage Orchestra, Japanese punk jazz band Soil & \\"Pimp\\" Sessions, Brooklyn-based pianist Elan Mehler and jazz vocalist Jos√© James. More recently, they've released music by Zara McFarlane, Ghostpoet's Mercury Prize-nominated debut and their long-running compilation series, compiled by Peterson, called Brownswood Bubblers. 2009 saw the birth of a new collaborative project and long-term partnership between Peterson and Havana Club's \\"Havana Cultura\\", a global initiative developed by Havana Club International that gives a platform to Cuban artists from all disciplines. Peterson and Brownswood's involvement began two years later, resulting in four album releases and three international tours. Havana Cultura: New Cuba Sound was the first album to come out of the project, released in 2010. Travelling to Cuba in 2009, Peterson teamed up with the award-winning Cuban jazz pianist Roberto Fonseca to find the best up-and-coming musical talent in Havana. The double CD album was a celebration of Cuba's musical forces spanning Latin, Afro jazz and fusion to hip-hop, funk, reggaeton and soul. In support of this project, Peterson began a European tour in June/July 2010, accompanied by Fonseca, his band and vocalists Danay Suarez, Ogguere and Obsesi√≥n. This was the first of three tours organised in close collaboration with Havana Club. The Gilles Peterson Havana Cultura Band has now travelled through Europe and beyond with shows in London (Barbican), Paris, Amsterdam, Istanbul, Berlin and Madrid, as well as many festivals. Travelling with the rest of the 2011 crew, Mala (Digital Mystikz) was also invited to Cuba with Peterson to record and collaborate with local musicians as part of the ongoing Havana Cultura project. The results are found on the album Mala in Cuba, which was released on Brownswood Recordings in partnership with Havana Cultura on 10 September 2012. =Festivals= In 2006, Peterson worked with Freshly Cut, a French event production company from Montpellier, to create the \\"Worldwide Festival\\", a small intimate festival during the summertime in the coastal town of S√®te in France. It's later expanded to include a winter versions which is now hosted in Leysin in the Swiss Alps. The Worldwide Awards is an annual event wherein Gilles Peterson chooses his favourite records of the year. His listeners then vote for the top 10 via the Radio 1 website. The event has been held at London venues including Cargo and KoKo with full broadcast coverage by Radio 1, and has expanded to include sections such as \\"Best Clubnight\\", \\"Best Record Shop\\", \\"Best Compilation Album\\", and a special award called \\"The John Peel'Play More Jazz' Award\\" given to an artist, often a newcomer, who has displayed special noteworthy work over the year. Peterson has made many regular appearances at music festivals across the world including Lovebox in east London, The Big Chill in Hereford and the Southport Weekender in the north west of England. Away from the UK he has appeared at the Exit Festival in Serbia, INmusic festival in Croatia, and in 2006 the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. Peterson also curated his own stage at Montreux Jazz Festival for 10 years during the 1990s. Recently he has appeared in festivals such as Tramlines, Standon Calling, Dimensions Festival in Croatia, Summerstage, Slide Festival and Odyssia Festival, where he gave a spontaneous interview sharing some interesting thoughts about music and festivals. Steve Reid Foundation In 2011, he founded the Steve Reid Foundation in memory of the legendary jazz drummer. Having witnessed Reid's suffering with illness and hardship, Gilles set up the charity to raise money for musicians in need. Since then, they've collaborated with Help Musicians UK to help musicians who are in need of support.

When Duke Boleslaus III was dethroned during a revolt by the Czech Vr≈°ovci clan, the Bohemian nobles declared Vladivoj, who had earlier fled to Poland, duke in 1002.

In November, he also obtained the support by the German king Henry II who enfeoffed him with the Bohemian duchy. After Vladivoj died in 1003, Boles≈Çaw the Brave invaded Bohemia and restored Boleslaus III who had many Bohemian noblemen murdered. It is said that Vladivoj was an alcoholic, and drinking was a possible contributor to his death.

He wrote novels, works for theatre and literary criticism. He is the first of the \\"novelists of the Revolution,\\" and he influenced other Mexican novelists of social protest. Among Azuela's first published writing were some short pieces for the magazine Gil Blas C√≥mico, where he wrote under the pen name of \\"Bele√±o\\", and his writing published under the heading Impresiones de un estudiante (Impressions of a Student) in 1896. His first novel, Maria Luisa, was written in 1907, followed by Los fracasados (The Failures) in 1908, and Mala yerba (Weeds) in 1909. The theme of his beginning novels are about fate. He wrote of the social life of Mexicans during the D√≠az dictatorship. After experiencing the Mexican Revolution first- hand, his writing style became sarcastic and disillusioned. His first novel with the Revolution theme is Andr√©s P√©rez, maderista in 1911, followed by Sin Amor (Without Love) in 1912, and his most popular, Los de abajo (The Underdogs) in 1915. He continued to write short works and novels influenced by the Revolution. It includes El camarada Pantoja (Comrade Pantoja) in 1937, Regina Landa in 1939, La nueva burgues√≠a (The New Bourgeoisie) in 1941, and La maldici√≥n (The Curse, published posthumously) in 1955. These works mainly depicts the satirical picture of life in post revolutionary Mexico sharply and angrily stigmatizing demagoguery and political intrigue. Early life and career Azuela was born in Lagos de Moreno, Jalisco to a small, but successful rancher, Evaristo Azuela and Paulina Azuela, on January 1, 1873. He grew up in a small farm owned by his father, which later influences the settings in many of his fictional works. He was first admitted to a Catholic seminary at the age of fourteen, but soon abandoned his religious studies. He studied medicine in Guadalajara, Jalisco. He received his M.D. in 1899, practicing medicine first in his home town of Lagos de Moreno, and later, after the Mexican revolution, practiced in Mexico City. In 1900, he married Carmen Rivera, niece of Agust√≠n Rivera, priest and historian of Lagos de Moreno. He went to have five sons and five daughters. Like most young students, Azuela was opposed to the dictatorship of the D√≠az regime. During his days in the Mexican Revolution, Azuela wrote about the war and its impact on Mexico. When Porfirio D√≠az was overthrown, Azuela was made Chief of Political Affairs of Lagos de Moreno in 1911 and state Director of Education of Jalisco in 1914 by president Francisco I. Madero. After Madero's assassination, he joined the Constitutionalist cause that sought to restore the rule of law. He traveled with the military forces of Juli√°n Medina, a follower of Pancho Villa, where he served as a field doctor. His participation in the conflict gave him ample material to write Los de abajo (The Underdogs) (1915). He later was forced for a time to emigrate to El Paso, Texas when the counterrevolutionary forces of Victoriano Huerta were temporarily triumphant. It was there that he wrote Los de abajo, which was his first-hand description of combat during the Mexican revolution, based on his experiences in the field. It was first published as a serial in the newspaper \\"El Paso del Norte\\" from October 1915 to December 1915. The book did not receive general recognition until 1924, and it was hailed as a novel of the Revolution. Los de abajo (The Underdogs) depicts the futility of the Revolution, the opportunists in power, and the underprivileged majority of his country. He fought for a better Mexico, and he believed the Revolution corrected some injustices, but it has given rise to others equally deplorable. The Mexican Revolution‚Äôs Effect on Mariano Azuela‚Äôs Writing Career Through studying the encyclopedic entries of Nicol√°s Kanellos, Brown Foundation Professor of Hispanic Studies teaching at the University of Houston, in The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Latino Literature discussing Mariano Azuela's involvement in The Mexican Revolution, the strong influence and lasting impressions of the revolution on his writing career become evident. In his encyclopedia entry ‚ÄúAzuela, Mariano (1873-1952)‚Äù, Nicol√°s Kanellos underscores Azuela's physical involvement in the war, and its influence on Azuela's literary career. Kanellos begins by describing Azuela as, ‚Äúone of Mexico‚Äôs greatest novelists and chroniclers of the Mexican Revolution‚Äù (Kanellos, 105).Kanellos, Nicol√°s. \\"Azuela, Mariano (1873‚Äì1952)\\". The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Latino Literature [Three Volumes]. Ed. Nicol‚Ä°s Kanellos. Santa Barbara, CA: Greenwood, 2008. ABC-CLIO eBook Collection. Pg. 105. In describing Azuela as a ‚Äúchronicler‚Äù, Kanellos immediately highlights one important feature of Azuela and his work, which is his tendency to record and portray history. In highlighting Azuela's relationship between history and literature, Kanellos establishes the inseparability of political and global contexts within Azuela's literary works; for example, Azuela's novel ‚ÄúThe Underdogs‚Äù recounts the events of The Mexican Revolution from the perspective of the rebel soldiers. Therefore, Kanellos emphasizes the existing relationship between history and its involvement in Azuela's work. Kanellos then describes the reason as to why Azuela's literary works are deeply infused with Mexican politics and history stating, ‚ÄúAzuela‚Äôs early career as a writer, in fact, was developed while participating in the Revolution first-hand as a physician in the army of Francisco ‚ÄòPancho‚Äô Villa‚Äù (Kanellos, 105).Kanellos, Nicol√°s. \\"Azuela, Mariano (1873‚Äì1952)\\". The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Latino Literature [Three Volumes]. Ed. Nicol‚Ä°s Kanellos. Santa Barbara, CA: Greenwood, 2008. ABC-CLIO eBook Collection. Pg. 105. The terms ‚Äúfirst-hand‚Äù and ‚Äúparticipating‚Äù underscore Azuela's physical involvement in the war. Kanellos‚Äô use of the word ‚Äúdeveloped‚Äù then underscores the manner in which Azuela's physical involvement paved the way for his writing to grow and mature as a result of his experiences participating in the Mexican Revolution. Kanellos stresses in his encyclopedic entry the persisting role of history and its portrayal in Azuela's work, but he also emphasizes the manner in history, in particular the Mexican Revolution, essentially birthed Azuela's writing career. In understanding the relationship between Mariano Azuela's involvement in the Mexican Revolution and its effect on his writing career, the undertones of corruption and failed ideals in Azuela's novels such as ‚ÄúThe Underdogs‚Äù reveal a more personal perspective that highlights the contrasts between the reality of war and revolution in his novels. Cultural Identity in The Underdogs In Margy McCrary's article, ‚ÄúThe Aztec Connection: Exploring the Construction of Azuela's Revolutionaries in The Underdogs‚Äù, she examines the description of Demetrio as a ‚Äúfull-blooded Aztec‚Äù. She argues he gains authority over the land, and constructs a cultural identity where he and Mexican peasants must establish in order to resist the Spanish conquerors. McCrary contends that the purpose of a revolution is to reject the identity of the colonizer, but in order to do this ‚Äúsome sort of unified identity is necessary for a group to revolt successfully‚Äù (McCrary 31). The pre-colonial Aztec is embodied by Demetrio Mac√≠as because he is connected to both his ancestors and the land. Demetrio is depicted as ‚Äúriding proudly on his horse‚Äù with ‚Äúpure-blooded Aztec cheeks‚Äù, however, Demetrio ‚Äúseems devoid of any defined identity‚Äù because he never acknowledges a greater reasoning to his involvement in the revolution other than either revenge or satisfaction in being the revolutionaries' leader (Azuela 72). This illuminates that Azuela may care about the revolution more than the characters do. McCrary further explains that on page seventy-two of the novel, Macias and his ‚Äúmen threw out their chests as if to breathe the widening horizon‚Äù and the ‚Äúimmensity of the sky‚Äù illustrating how Demetrio's freedom is connected to the earth itself and that Demetrio is a legitimate inhabitant of the land. Furthermore, the sense of freedom that Demetrio and the Mexican men feel on the land serves to ‚Äúdistance them from their oppressed identities as colonized beings‚Äù because they immediately forget their bleak lives as conquered peasants (36). By depicting Demetrio as a pure-blooded Aztec, Azuela reveals that he as an author is ‚Äúdispleased with the current, colonized identity of his people‚Äù and wishes to reconstruct a strong Mexican identity before it had ‚Äúbeen influenced by the Spanish colonizers‚Äù (37). As a result, Azuela emphasizes the consequences of colonization because Demetrio is ‚Äúso far separated from his own heritage and identity that he does not even recognize it consciously‚Äù (39). When Demetrio begins to forget his identity it results in ‚Äúpetty fighting, looting, and anarchy‚Äù (34). Azuela emphasizes Demetrio's heritage so that readers understand what is at stake if cultural identity is lost. Later life In 1917 he moved to Mexico City where, for the rest of his life, he continued his writing, and worked as a doctor among the poor. In 1942 he received the Mexican National Prize for Literature. On April 8, 1943 he became a founding member of Mexico's National College, where he gave lectures on Mexican, French, and Spanish novelists, and on his own literary experiences. In 1949 he received the Mexican National Prize for Arts and Sciences. He died in Mexico City March 1, 1952 and was placed in a sepulchre of the Pante√≥n Civil in the Rotonda de los Hombres Ilustres. 2015 Conference on Mariano Azuela and the Novel of the Mexican Revolution On the anniversary year of his famous novel, The Underdogs, a conference was held in collaboration by the Chicano Studies departments of both California State University, Los Angeles and the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). It was held on May 15‚Äì16 at California State University, Los Angeles and contained speakers who were scholars of either Mariano Azuela or the works of the Mexican Revolution.

Ecclesiastical career He was a son of Jind≈ôich (d. after 1169), a younger brother of Duke Vladislaus II of Bohemia, and his wife Margaret. After brilliant studies at the University of Paris, he returned to Bohemia and was named provost at the Basilica of St. Peter and St. Paul in Vy≈°ehrad. In 1182, he accepted the diaconate from the hands of his P≈ôemyslid cousin Archbishop Adalbert III of Salzburg. Henry Bretislaus was elected on March 25 of the same year as successor of the late Prague bishop Valentin, and went to Mainz to receive affirmation by Metropolitan Christian I. He was ordained a priest on 22 May and crowned bishop the following day. Bretislaus soon came into conflict with Duke Frederick of Bohemia, who had regained the Bohemian throne in 1178 and usurped discretionary power over ecclesiastical properties. In 1187, the bishop officially addressed Emperor Frederick Barbarossa to complain about the duke's infringements. In turn, the emperor elevated Henry Bretislaus to a prince of the Holy Roman Empire, providing that the Prague bishop was only subject to the Holy Roman Emperor. However, the imperial immediacy did not outlast Bretislaus's tenure. In the ongoing quarrels over the Prague throne between Duke Frederick and his successors Conrad II and Wenceslaus II, he supported Ottokar, a younger son of the late King Vladislaus II with his second wife Judith of Thuringia. In 1192, Ottokar usurped the Bohemian throne from Wenceslaus II, allied with his younger brother Vladislaus Henry, Prince of Brno and Znojmo, whom he appointed Margrave of Moravia. Wenceslaus tried to petition Emperor Henry VI for assistance, but was captured. Henry Bretislaus supported Ottokar, but was unable to pay the necessary tribute of 6,000 √©cus to the emperor for the Bohemian crown and the Moravian margraviate. While on a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, he was captured by Henry VI, who held him captive at his court. Duke of Bohemia Emperor Henry VI, however, was not ignorant of Bohemian affairs. When Ottokar joined a revolt of several German princes against the ruling House of Hohenstaufen, he and his brother and Vladislaus Henry were declared deposed in June 1193 by a decision of the Imperial Diet at Worms. Ottokar was abandoned by the nobility and fled; the emperor exempted his cousin Bishop Henry Bretislaus from the payment and enfeoffed him with the Bohemian duchy. Margrave Vladislaus Henry was summoned to Prague Castle, where he had to spend the following years suspiciously eyed by Duke Bretislaus. Bretislaus had to secure his duchy by force of arms. By Christmas 1193, he was keeping court at Prague. In 1195, he drove Vladislaus out of Moravia and installed one of his supporters in the march. Bretislaus also took part in an Imperial campaign in Meissen, where his army plundered the churches. To make amends, he planned to take part in the German Crusade of 1197, decided on at the diet of Worms of December 1195, but due to his prolonged illness it was never actualised. When Ottokar marched against Prague, Henry Bretislaus proceeded to the Imperial Palace in Eger (Cheb), where he died on 15 or 19 June 1197. He is buried in the Doksany monastery church. On 23 June the Bohemian nobles elected Margrave Vladislaus Henry his successor. Shortly afterwards, he came to terms with his brother Ottokar, who finally ascended the Prague throne and the next year obtained the royal title from Philip of Swabia, confirmed by the German king Frederick II in the 1212 Golden Bull of Sicily.

A declared opponent of the Nazi regime from the beginning, he actively participated in the Kreisau Circle of Helmuth James Graf von Moltke and Peter Yorck von Wartenburg. Together with Claus von Stauffenberg and Fritz-Dietlof von der Schulenburg he conspired in the 20 July plot, and was supposed to be appointed Secretary of State in the Foreign Office and lead negotiator with the Western Allies if they had succeeded. Life his father, Adam von Trott was born in Potsdam, Brandenburg, into the Protestant Trott zu Solz dynasty, members of the Hessian Uradel nobility. He was the fifth child of the Prussian Culture Minister August von Trott zu Solz (1855‚Äì1938) and Emilie Eleonore (1875‚Äì1948), n√©e von Schweinitz, whose father served as German ambassador in Vienna and Saint Petersburg. By her mother Anna Jay, Emilie Eleonore was a great-great granddaughter of John Jay, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States and the first Chief Justice of the United States. Adam von Trott zu Solz was first raised in Berlin and from 1915 was sent to the Franz√∂sisches Gymnasium preschool. When his father resigned from office in 1917, the family moved to Kassel where von Trott attended the Friedrichsgymnasium. From 1922 he lived in Hann. M√ºnden and temporarily joined the German Youth Movement. He obtained his Abitur degree in 1927 and went on to study law at the universities of Munich and G√∂ttingen. Von Trott developed a strong interest in international politics during a stay in Geneva, seat of the League of Nations, for several weeks in Autumn 1928. He spent Hilary term of 1929 in Oxford studying theology at Mansfield College, Oxford, when he became friends with the historian A. L. Rowse, and returned to the UK in 1931 on a Rhodes Scholarship to study at Balliol College, Oxford where he became a close friend of David Astor and an acquaintance of the eminent philosopher R. G. Collingwood.For the impact on von Trott of his experience as a Rhodes Scholar, see, e.g., Donald Markwell, Instincts to Lead, 2013, pages 148-62 & passim Rowse, who was gay, developed an intense infatuation with the heterosexual Trott, calling him one of the most beautiful, intelligent and charming men he had ever met. In his 1961 book All Souls and Appeasement, published when homosexuality was still illegal in Britain, Rowse wrote about Trott's \\"beautiful head\\" with an \\"immensely lofty forehead, deep-violet eyes, nobility and sadness in the expression even when young, infinitely sensitive and understanding\\", writing \\"I had never met anything like it\\". Rowse called his relationship with Trott an \\"ideal platonic\\" relationship, saying that Trott was a man he could never forget. Rowse, who was active in the Labour Party, claimed to have introduced Trott to socialism, noting that Trott had translated parts of Rowse's book Politics and the Younger Generation into German when they were published in Neu Bl√§tter f√ºr den Sozialismus. Following his studies at Oxford, Trott spent six months in the United States. Deeply influenced by the theories of Hegel, Trott believed that the most pressing issue raised by the Great Depression would be how to seek a synthesis of conservatism and socialism, which he believed to be the only solution to the Great Depression. For Trott, the Great Depression proved the failure of capitalism as an economic system, but at the same time, he was unwilling to accept communism as an alternative, which led him to seek a \\"third way\\" between capitalism and communism, arguing in a 1933 letter to his father that the \\"right to work\\" had replaced Hegel's \\"right to a free will\\" as the most pressing issue of the modern age. In the same letter, Trott argued that what was needed was an economic system that guaranteed every man a job, saying that the freedom of the individual counted for nothing if one was unemployed. Somewhat to the shock of his conservative father, Trott was willing in the early 1930s to exchange ideas with Social Democrats as he set about developing a sort of socialist conservatism. Trott told his father in February 1933 that \\"the positive rights of the individual\\" could be secured if the rights of the \\"masses\\" were \\"held sacred\\", something that he believed the new government of Adolf Hitler and Franz von Papen had no intention of doing. =Travels= In 1937, Trott was posted to China as a research fellow for the Institute of Pacific Relations under a research grant from the Ausw√§rtiges Amt. He took advantage of his travels to try to raise support outside Germany for the internal resistance against the Nazis. At the time there was an informal alliance between China and Germany with a German military mission training the Chinese National Revolutionary Army which was largely armed with German weapons and German business being favored with investments in China in exchange for China helping German rearmament by selling the Reich certain strategic raw materials at below cost. Given the closeness in relations between China and Germany, as a German citizen, Trott enjoyed a certain privileged status in China, as Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek had often described Nazi Germany as a model for China. A Sinophile, Trott had gone to China to study Confucian philosophy and learn Mandarin, as he put it that he was hoping to find in \\"China's ancient wisdom\\" a solution to the spiritual malaise of the West. Trott believed that modern Western civilization had lost any sense of the spiritual, which he believed still existed in China. The British historian D.C. Watt rather dismissively wrote that Trott was an impractical idealist who spent of much of 1937 and 1938 in China looking for the answers of the problems of the modern life by studying Confucianism and Taoism. The Confucian ideal of rule by enlightened and philosophical mandarins also appealed to Trott as an inspiration for a political system. The Confucian principle that mandarins should not serve an unjust emperor and it was better to suffer and die rather than serve a tyrant influenced Trott's political thinking. Together with his Chinese teacher who served as his translator, Trott traveled several times to Beijing to talk to various Confucian scholars living in that city, hoping to find the spirituality that he believed that the West was lacking and needed so desperately. During the Sino-Japanese war, which began in July 1937, Trott's sympathies were entirely with China. During his time in China, Trott got to know the head of the German military mission, General Alexander von Falkenhausen, very well, and as both men were disillusioned by the pro-Japanese line taken by the Ausw√§rtiges Amt after the very pro-Japanese and anti-Chinese Joachim von Ribbentrop became Foreign Minister in February 1938, bonded over their shared disapproval of Ribbentrop and his anti-Chinese foreign policy line. In June 1938, the German military mission in China was ordered to return to the Reich and Germany ceased its arm sales to China as Ribbentrop swung German foreign policy decisively behind Japan, causing a rapid chill to set in over the once warm relations between Nanking and Berlin. Trott decided to leave China at the same time that the German military mission was recalled. One of Trott's closest friends was the British journalist Shiela Grant Duff who however passionately disagreed with him over the issue of Czechoslovakia, a country that she admired and loved as much he hated it. The German nationalist Trott made no secret of his dislike of Czechoslovakia as an \\"artificial state\\" created by the Treaty of Versailles and believed that Germany had the right to annex the Sudetenland region, meaning that essentially Trott supported his country's foreign policy in regards to Czechoslovakia in 1938. The Chinese historian Liang Hsi-Huey wrote there was a certain dichotomy in Trott's thinking between his dislike of the Nazis vs. his support for Germany's great power ambitions, which made for an ambivalent attitude towards Nazi foreign policy. Liang, whose father Liang Lone was the Chinese minister in Prague between 1933‚Äì39, wrote that people like Trott, conservative nationalists opposed to Hitler and who sympathised with China in its struggle against Japan, had much difficulty with accepting the thesis that nations like Czechoslovakia had the right to exist. Liang wrote that there was a striking contrast between Trott's views towards China, which he argued had the right to determine its own future and should not be dominated by Japan vs. his views towards Czechoslovakia, which he saw as an \\"artificial state\\" that was occupying land that rightfully belonged to Germany. The British historian Sir John Wheeler-Bennett, who knew most of the men involved in the plots against Hitler between 1938-44 personally, wrote these men were all nationalists whose views towards Czechoslovakia and Poland were essentially the same as Hitler's-namely that Eastern Europe was Germany's rightful sphere of influence and the Reich had the right to take whatever it wanted in the region. After the Munich Agreement, Trott in a letter to his friend, Lord Lothian, praised \\"Mr. Chamberlain's courageous lead\\" in ensuring that the Sudetenland was allowed to join Germany without a war and disparaged Winston Churchill as a \\"warmonger\\". In 1939, during the course of three visits to London, he lobbied Lord Lothian and Lord Halifax to pressure the British government to abandon the \\"containment\\" policy directed against Adolf Hitler, which had been adopted on 31 March 1939 with the \\"guarantee\\" of Poland. Trott was a close friend of Ernst von Weizs√§cker, the State Secretary at the Ausw√§rtiges Amt, and he visited London as an unofficial diplomat representing Weizs√§cker, who in a move reflecting the chaotic politics of the Third Reich, had adopted his foreign policy that ran parallel to the policy of the Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop. Weizs√§cker knowing that a planned German invasion of Poland scheduled for August 1939 (later pushed back to 1 September) was likely to cause an Anglo-German war, had adopted his policy of offering to restore independence to Czechoslovakia sans the Sudetenland in exchange for which Britain would end the \\"guarantee\\" of Poland and allow Germany to take back the Free City of Danzig, the Polish Corridor and parts of Upper Silesia lost to Poland. Weizs√§cker was a man of extreme anti-Polish prejudices, who warmly welcomed the idea of a war to destroy Poland, but was rather less keen on the idea of a war with Britain, hence his repeated efforts to sever Britain from Poland in 1939. Like Weizs√§cker, Trott was unwilling to consider returning the Sudetenland, but he was prepared to consider restoring Czech independence in exchange for Germany taking back all of the lands lost to Poland after World War I. The plan drawn up by Weizs√§cker and Trott called for Britain to end the \\"guarantee\\" of Poland to pressure the Poles to return the disputed territories. Through Trott professed to believe the Poles would give in to German diplomatic pressure once the \\"guarantee\\" had been removed, such a situation would allow Germany to invade Poland without fear of a war with Britain, although Trott also claimed to believe that if such situation would emerge then the Wehrmacht generals would overthrow Hitler. Rowse called Trott's visits to Britain in June 1939 as a \\"double mission, an official and an unofficial one\\", to sound out the British Establishment about where Britain stood in regards to the Danzig crisis and to report it back to Hitler while also seeking to make contacts with Britain on behalf of the resistance group. Trott spent the weekend of 2‚Äì3 June 1939 at Cliveden and on 7 June 1939 met Chamberlain at Chequers. Lord Lothian told Trott that Britain was unwilling to undo the Munich Agreement and accepted the Sudetenland as part of the Reich, but could not accept the Reich Protectorate of Bohemia-Moravia, saying that it was essential that Czech independence be restored, and that Anglo-German relations could not be improved unless that happened. As a Rhodes scholar, Trott was able to use his friends from days in Oxford in the Establishment to meet the Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and the Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax, in June 1939. At his meeting with Chamberlain at Chequers, Trott was informed that it was not possible for Britain to end the \\"guarantee\\" of Poland and that if Germany wanted better relations, \\"it was for Herr Hitler to undo the mischief he had done\\". Chamberlain complained that British public opinion had been \\"passionately stirred\\" by the German occupation of the rump state of Czecho-Slovakia in March 1939 and would go to war with Germany rather than see another nation \\"destroyed\\". Trott submitted an account of his British visits to Walther Hewel, who in turn submitted it to Hitler. When Trott returned to Germany, Weizs√§cker tried to set up a meeting where Trott would brief Hitler and Ribbentrop about his British visit, but neither wanted to see him. Trott returned to Britain for a third visit to repeat his \\"Danzig for Prague\\" offer, and this time he stated he was not coming on behalf of the German government, but rather as a representative of a resistance group, which confused British officials about where his true loyalties were. The German historian Klemens von Klemperer argued that the purpose behind Trott's \\"Danzig for Prague\\" offer was to discredit Hitler since he expected Hitler to refuse it if the British made it, which would somehow cause the Wehrmacht generals to turn against Hitler. Klemperer wrote that there was a certain lack of \\"clear strategy\\" behind Trott's \\"Danzig for Prague\\" proposal, since Trott himself never entirely made it clear how this plan to ensure that the Free City of Danzig rejoining Germany without a war was supposed to cause the overthrow of Hitler. Wheeler-Bennett who had lived in Berlin between 1927‚Äì34 and who met Trott during his visits to London in 1939 wrote that he \\"...had about him a certain confused political mysticism, a vague Hegelianism which induced in him, not, to be sure, the worship of the F√ºhrerprinzip, but a deep veneration for German military and political traditions, and what he believed to be the innate integrity of the German soul\\". Wheeler-Bennett further wrote that Trott and his friend Count Helmuth von Moltke who came with him to London were both intense German nationalists who \\"...through they deplored the spirit of the Munich Agreement and the subsequent dismemberment of Czechoslovakia, expressed strong anti-Czech sentiments, and from neither was there forthcoming any indication that a 'de-nazified' Germany was be prepared to forgo Hitler's annexation of Austria and the Sudetenland. Indeed it was hinted from that Britain and France might well reward the conspirators, if successful, with the return of Germany's former colonial possessions\\". Rowse who last saw Trott for the last time during his visits to Britain in 1939 wrote Trott's Hegelianism \\"profoundly affected his mind\\" as \\"with him black was never black, and white white; black was always in the process of becoming white, white of becoming black\\". Rowse wrote \\"...Adam entered deeply, ambivalently into relations with the Nazis without being one, indeed while belonging to the resistance movement\\". The German historian Hans Mommsen wrote the majority of the conservatives opposed to Hitler in no way wanted a return to the democratic Weimar Republic, which they also rejected, instead looking back to the reformers who restructured Prussia during the Napoleonic wars as their ideal and role model. For the anti-Nazi conservatives, the emphasis was upon reforming the system instead of a revolution to destroy it, as the majority of the conservatives believed in the ideal of the volksgemeinschaft that would unite the German people as one and only wanted a \\"true\\" volksgemeinschaft instead of they saw as the twisted Nazi version of the volksgemeinschaft. The emphasis was on putting into effect the \\"right\\" ideas of National Socialism which the conservatives believed that the Nazis had botched in the execution. In regards to foreign policy, the anti-Nazi conservatives believed that Hitler's foreign policy goal of making Germany into Europe's number one power was a correct one. Their objections to Nazi foreign policy were only that Hitler was executing his foreign policy in a reckless, adventurist way that threatened to create a coalition that would defeat Germany; it was only the means, not the ends of Hitler's foreign policy that they were opposed to. Mommsen argued what he called the \\"ambivalence\\" of Trott who worked towards achieving certain Nazi foreign policy goals at the same time he was working for the overthrow of the Nazi regime makes sense if one accepts the thesis that Trott and others like him were out to reform the volksgemeinschaft from what they saw as its Nazi perversion instead of working for its destruction. The distinction that Trott drew between Germany's \\"rightful\\" policy of seeking to undo the Treaty of Versailles vs. his opposition to the Nazi regime was often lost on his British friends, since for many of them he was advocating the same foreign policy goals as Hitler. Trott did not understand the way in which British public opinion had changed as he spent much time in Britain attacking the Treaty of Versailles in such violent language that many of his British friends came to believe that he was no different from the Nazis. Rowse attended a meeting at the Cliveden estate, where Trott spoke with Lord Lothian, Lord Astor, Lord Halifax and Sir Thomas Inskip about Anglo-German relations, repeating his \\"Danzig for Prague\\" offer and praising \\"the greatness of our F√ºhrer\\". However, Rowse that he was alone with Trott that the latter said: \\"If they kill me, you will never forgive them, will you?\\" Trott's ideas led to a complete rejection of democracy as a system morally no different from National Socialism. In 1938, Trott wrote to a British friend that what was happening in Germany was a \\"European phenomenon\\", believing that with the Industrial Revolution, European society had become dehumanised and lost its spiritual core. Trott wrote this was much a problem of democratic as totalitarian countries, writing: \\"It is my opinion that this pandering to the instinctual side of human consciousness, as much by democracy as by totalitarianism, is what has led to the sterile and cynical defeatism that lies at the root of Europe's intellectual chaos\\". Trott believed the \\"mass society\\" created by the Industrial Revolution had allowed demagogues to be exploit \\"the masses\\", and argued that the \\"Anglo-Saxon\\" system of individual liberty built around democracy was no essentially no different from National Socialism as it allowed \\"the masses\\" to be exploited. In a letter to Grant Duff, Trott wrote: \\"You have not satisfactorily answered my argument, that it is possible that capitalist and imperialist democracy may use liberty simply as a cloak for a policy that relies very much on compulsion, whereas some aspects of 'authoritarian systems could provide a basically more genuine guarantee of human rights in modern industrial society\\". In 1939, Trott wrote that the last ten years had shown the \\"indiscriminate trust in the judgement of the masses is no use...One way or the other, popular movements have led to despotism\\". In Trott's viewpoint, only the rule by Germany's traditional elites who were committed to conservative values and would rule according to the rule of law could ensure a truly just society. Trott believed that in such a system, where traditional elites ruled by excluding the masses from politics, could a political system be created that was genuinely concerned with the best interests of society, telling his friend Julie Braun-Vogelstein \\"Go and write an essay on Tradition and Socialism!\\", meaning only the rules by traditional elites could really achieve socialism. Trott called for a political system that would secure the \\"liberation of the masses from economic need\\" by the authoritarian rule by the traditional elites whose values would be based on Christianity. Various messengers from the Widerstand movements had arrived in Britain in 1938-39 stating if only Britain abandoned appeasement, then the leaders of the Wehrmacht would stage a putsch to depose Hitler rather than fight a war with Britain again. In August 1939, the British government repeatedly warned Germany that an attack on Poland would cause a war with Britain, in part out of the hope that the Wehrmacht would indeed overthrow Hitler rather than risk another world war. On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland and on 3 September 1939, Britain declared war on Germany. Despite the promises of numerous messengers, the Wehrmacht stayed loyal to Germany, continued on with the conquest of Poland, and made no effort to depose Hitler. The fact that the Wehrmacht stayed loyal to Hitler in 1939 in spite of all the promises from anti-Nazi Germans that it would not if only Britain made a firm stand against Hitler did much to discredit the Widerstand movement in British eyes and much of Trott's difficulty in enlisting British support was due to this fact. A friend of Weizs√§cker, Trott formally joined the Ausw√§rtiges Amt in 1939 at his suggestion after having worked for the Ausw√§rtiges Amt as a researcher on China for the previous two years . In October 1939, Trott went to the United States to attend a conference of the Institute of Pacific Relations in Virginia Beach in November 1939. On his way to the United States, Trott was almost interned in Gibraltar as an enemy alien where his ship had stopped, but was able to persuade the British officials that he was an Afrikaner from South Africa, using his Balliol tie as proof that he attended Balliol College (which was true), which meant he could not be a German (which was not). He also visited Washington, D.C. in October of that year in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain American support. He met with Roger Baldwin, Edward C. Carter, William J. Donovan, and Felix Morley of The Washington Post.von Klemperer, Klemens. (1992). German Resistance against Hitler: the Search for Allies Abroad, 1938-1945. Oxford: Clarendon Press. p. 148n. . During the conference in Virginia Beach, Trott met numerous members of the business and academic worlds of the United States and Canada who were interested in China. Wheeler-Bennett, who owned an estate in Virginia and shared Trott's interests in Sinology, also attended the conference in Virginia Beach. Wheeler-Bennett wrote: > \\"In the plenary sessions and committees of the conference, von Trott > observed a very 'correct' attitude. He did not openly defend Nazi > principles, but confined himself to several recapitulations of the German > case on the usual well-known lines, which might be employed by Germans of > nearly any political complexion.

To the suggestion that a non- > Nazi Germany might, as an earnest of good faith, restore some of the > territorial acquisitions of Adolf Hitler, von Trott returned an > uncompromising negative\\". Trott's proposals were passed on to the US Department of State, the Canadian Ministry of External Affairs and the British Embassy in Washington D.C, where the reaction was deeply negative as the consensus was that Germany would have to give up its gains in Poland and the Czech lands as the price for peace, something that Trott had indicated that he no interest in doing. However, Trott's suggestions for the basis of peace, which he wrote down after meeting several German emigres in the United States were passed on the White House and led President Roosevelt to send Summer Welles, the undersecretary at the State Department, on a peace mission to Europe in February 1940 to try to mediate an end to the war. =Foreign office= Friends warned Trott not to return to Germany but his conviction that he had to do something to stop the madness of Hitler and his henchmen led him to return. Once there, in 1940 Trott joined the Nazi Party in order to access party information and monitor its planning. At the same time, he served as a foreign policy advisor to the clandestine group of intellectuals planning the overthrow of the Nazi regime known as the Kreisau Circle. In late spring 1941, Wilhelm Keppler, Secretary of State (Staatssekret√§r) at the German Foreign Office, was appointed director of Special Bureau for India (Sonderreferat Indien) created in the Information Ministry to aid, and liaise with, Indian nationalist Subhas Chandra Bose, former president of the Indian National Congress, who had arrived in Berlin in early April 1941. The day-to-day work with Bose became the responsibility of Trott. Trott used the cover of the Special Bureau for his anti-Nazi activities, traveling to Scandinavia, Switzerland, and Turkey, and in addition, all of Nazi-occupied Europe to seek out German military officers opposing Nazism. Bose and Trott, however, did not become close, and Bose most likely did not know about Trott's anti-Nazi work. According to historian Leonard A. Gordon, there were also tensions between Trott and Bose's wife, Emilie Schenkl, each disliking the other intensely. Trott was a member of the Kreisau Circle, a group of intellectuals who believed in a sort of conservative Christian socialism who met at the estate of Count von Moltke in Kreisau in Silesia. The Kreisau Circle was in contact with the main opposition group led by General Ludwig Beck and Carl Frederich Goerdeler, but differed with the Beck-Goerdeler group over a number of issues. On 22 January 1943, at the house of Count Peter Hans Yorck von Wartenburg, a meeting was held between the two groups. Attending the meeting for the \\"senior group\\" were General Beck, Goerdeler, Ulrich von Hassell, and Johannnes Popitz and for the Kreisau Circle Count von Moltke, Trott, Count Yorck von Wartenburg, Eugen Gerstenmaier, and Fritz von der Schulenburg. The left-learning Kreisau Circle members objected to Goerdeler's beliefs in lassize-faire capitalism and to his plans to restore the monarchy. The clash between the two groups was in large part generational as the conservative \\"senior group\\" were all older men like Goerdeler who came of age under the Second Reich and were far more attached to the House of Hohenzollern than were the younger men like Trott who came of age under the Weimar Republic. The diplomat Hassell of the \\"seniors\\" and the policeman von der Schulenburg of the \\"juniors\\" were able to mediate a compromise despite the shouting between Goerdeler and Moltke, but the differences were by no means resolved. After the meeting of 22 January, no conferences were held, but Trott and von der Schulenburg remained in regular contact with Hassell and Popitiz. In 1942, Trott together with other members of the Kreisau Circle became vaguely aware of the \\"Final Solution to the Jewish Question\\" and became curious of the fate of the Jews sent away to \\"resettlement in the East\\". In March 1943, Trott reported at a meeting of the Kreisau Circle that he learned through sources within the Reich government that he considered very reliable that there was a concentration camp in Upper Silesia that held about 40,000-50,000 people with a \\"killing rate\\" of 3,000-4,000 people per month. Trott did not name the camp in Upper Silesia, but it seems he was referring to Auschwitz. Like most other German conservatives, Trott had deep doubts about the intelligence and morality of ordinary people, holding that only an elite had the necessary qualities to govern. In 1943, Trott wrote: \\"An exclusively rationalist upbringing has made us fail to understand both human nature and the realities of mass society, and we have come to ignore the demons which the Vermassung of mankind has released\\". Trott believed in the original, positive view of the Sonderweg of Germany as a Central European power that was neither of the West nor of the East. Trott expressed these ideas in his memorandum Germany Between East and West, which is lost, but according to those who read it called for Germany to seek a \\"middle way\\" between the \\"eastern principle of political realism\\" and the \\"western principle of individuality\\", which in practice would mean a social-economic system that would be a mixture of both capitalism and communism. Trott believed that \\"eastern\\" countries like the Soviet Union were too collectivist while \\"western\\" countries like the United States were too individualistic, and that Germans like himself needed to develop a middle way between east and west for the betterment of all humanity. Trott believed that both capitalist democracy and Communism were flawed systems that had dehumanised society, and Germany should follow neither. Despite Trott's reputation as someone oriented towards \\"Western\\" values, based on his education at Oxford and Anglo-American friends, Trott was in fact deeply hostile towards the American \\"pioneer\\" ideal of a rugged individualist on both moral and practical grounds, believing that such individualism promoted selfishness, greed and amorality. Trott came to find his political idea in the mir (\\"commune\\") of Imperial Russia. Germans tended to have two contradictory pictures of Russia as either a primitive and savage \\"Asian\\" country that was threatening Europe or to see it in idealised and romantic terms as a place where the people were simple, but more spiritual than the people in the West. Trott had a rather idealised and romanticised view of the mir, as he believed the Russian muzhiks had a lifestyle where everybody worked together as a community while allowing room for individualism, non-conformity, and eccentricities, the perfect blend of the extremes between East and West that Trott sought for Germany. Trott believed the life of the muzhiks in the mir was deeply influenced by the values of Orthodox church, making for a very spiritual life while at the same time accepting individualism and rationality. Moreover, Trott believed life in the mir was simple and in harmony with nature, being untouched by either modern technology or ideology, allowing people to be honest, spiritual, and personal in a way that was not possible in either the Soviet Union or the West. Trott believed that the Soviet regime had in its campaign to \\"collectivise\\" Soviet farms had destroyed his idealised mir, but this romantic view of the mir provided the basis for Trott's thinking about the sort of society he wanted to bring about. Trott's beliefs about the need for more \\"spiritual\\" society brought him into conflict with Carl Goerdeler and Colonel Hans Oster, who wanted to restore the monarchy and bring back the system that existed up until 1918 in Germany, which Trott rejected arguing that something new was needed. Trott belonged to the \\"Easterner\\" faction of the opposition who favored making peace with the Soviet Union first after the overthrow of Hitler and distrusted the \\"Anglo-Saxon\\" powers of the United States and Great Britain. In December 1943, Trott told Hassell that he felt the United States and the United Kingdom were too fearful of \\"a change of regime [in Germany] should turn out to be only a cloak hiding a continuation of militaristic Nazi methods under another label\\". Certain underground Social Democratic politicians complained of an increase of the appeal of the underground Communist Party and of the Soviet sponsored Free German National Committee among the German working class. As a result, the underground SPD politicians asked their \\"parlour-pink\\" friend Trott to appeal to the United States and Great Britain to change their policies towards Germany. In April 1944 during a visit to Switzerland, Trott met with British and American diplomats to complain that to most anti-Nazi Germans it seemed that \\"the Anglo-Saxon countries are filled with bourgeois prejudice and pharisaic theorizing\\" in contrast to the Soviets who were offering \\"constructive ideas and plans for the rebuilding of Germany\\". Trott stated that after three years of war with the Soviet Union that the Wehrmacht now had considerable respect for the fighting power of the Red Army, and claimed that the propaganda of Free Germany Committee in Moscow which made a distinction between the German people and the Nazi regime was having much impact in Germany. Wheeler-Bennett wrote that Trott was \\"no Red sympathizer\\" and what he was \\"...endeavouring to do, in fact, was to induce London and Washington to engage in a bidding match with Moscow from the result of which Germany could not but benefit, but he certainly did not favor a Bolshevik solution\\". Wheeler-Bennett wrote the thinking of the Kreisau Circle was very \\"confused\\", but they \\"were not Communists\\". Wheeler-Bennett concluded: \\"Their thinking, it is true, turned to the East rather than the West because, in their idealistic impractical illusions, they looked for an upheaval both in Russia and in Germany. If this were to occur, the two states would have many problems in common, problems which could not be solved by the established bourgeois standards of the West, but which called for a radically new treatment which should be neither authoritarian nor democratic, but which should be guided by a return to 'the spiritual (but not the ecclesiastical) traditions of Christianity'\\". =20 July 1944 plot= Trott zu Solz on trial at the Volksgerichtshof, 1944 Trott was one of the leaders of Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg's plot of 20 July 1944 to assassinate Hitler. He was arrested within days, placed on trial and found guilty. Sentenced to death on 15 August 1944 by the Volksgerichtshof (People's Court), he was hanged in Berlin's Pl√∂tzensee Prison on 26 August. Commemoration Trott is one of five Germans who are commemorated on the World War II memorial stone at Balliol College, Oxford. His name is also recorded among the Rhodes Scholars war dead in the Rotunda of Rhodes House, Oxford. In July 1998, the British magazine Prospect published an edited version of the lecture given by the German historian Joachim Fest at the inauguration of the Adam von Trott Meeting Room at Balliol College, Oxford. Fest said: Inscription in the chapel of Mansfield College, Oxford in memory of alumni including von Trott zu Solz The Adam von Trott Memorial Appeal at Mansfield College runs annual lectures on themes relevant to his life and work, and funds scholarships for young Germans to read for a master's degree in politics at the college. Clarita von Trott Adam von Trott married Clarita Tiefenbacher in June 1940. He was survived by her, who was jailed for some months, and by their two daughters, who were taken from their grandmother's house by the Gestapo and given to Nazi Party families for adoption. Their mother recovered them in 1945. Clarita von Trott died in Berlin, at the age of 95, on 28 March 2013.Death of Clarita von Trott, osthessen-news.de; accessed 15 May 2015.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a shortstop for the Chicago White Sox (1950‚Äì1955), Cleveland Indians (1956‚Äì1958), Kansas City Athletics (1958) and the Baltimore Orioles (1959). Carrasquel was the first in a long line of Major League shortstops from Venezuela including, Luis Aparicio, Dave Concepci√≥n, Ozzie Guill√©n and Omar Vizquel among others. He was notable for his excellent defensive abilities and for being the first Latin American in MLB history to start in an All-Star Game. Playing career Born in Caracas, Carrasquel began his professional baseball career in at the age of 17 with the Cervecer√≠a Caracas team, where he hit the first home run in Venezuelan Professional Baseball League history. He was signed in by the Brooklyn Dodgers, and was immediately promoted to the Double-A Fort Worth Cats. Carrasquel provided good fielding and hit .315 during the season and .364 in the playoffs to help spur the Cats to the 1949 Texas League championship. His inability to speak English fluently may have caused Dodgers General Manager Branch Rickey to sell him to the Chicago White Sox although, Rickey later admitted that the move was a mistake. White Sox' General Manager Frank Lane solved the language communication problem by trading Carrasquel's uncle Alex for reliever Witto Aloma, who served as the interpreter between Carrasquel and White Sox' manager Jack Onslow. Carrasquel joined the White Sox in 1950, becoming the third Venezuelan to play in Major League Baseball after his uncle, Alex Carrasquel (Washington Senators, 1939) and Chucho Ramos (Cincinnati Reds, in 1944). He became the White Sox's starting shortstop, replacing the forty-one-year-old Luke Appling, who had held the position since 1930. Carrasquel soon established himself as an excellent defensive player, combining with second baseman Nellie Fox to make one of the best double play combinations in the league. His cheerful disposition and apparent love for playing baseball, made him extremely popular with Chicago fans. As a rookie, Carrasquel hit for a career-high .282 batting average in 141 games and, amassed a 24-game hitting streak until Red Sox pitcher Ellis Kinder stopped the streak. In September, he suffered a torn cartilage in his right knee and had to sit out the remainder of the season. Carrasquel finished the season ranked third in voting for the American League Rookie of the Year Award, behind Walt Dropo and Whitey Ford, and finished 12th in the American League Most Valuable Player Award ballot. In , Carrasquel beat out the reigning American League Most Valuable Player, Phil Rizzuto, in voting for the shortstop of the American League in the 1951 All- Star Game. He became the first Latin American player to be selected to start in an All-Star Game. On July 19, 1951, Carrasquel broke Rizzuto's Major League record by handling 297 consecutive chances in 53 games without committing an error. The record would stand for 18 years until , when Don Kessinger of the Chicago Cubs set a new record by playing in 54 games without committing an error. He ended the year leading the league's shortstops in assists and in fielding percentage. In November 1951, it was reported that Boston Red Sox manager, Lou Boudreau, wanted to trade Ted Williams for Carrasquel but Lane refused the offer. Carrasquel had an off year in 1952 as a broken finger and then weight problems saw his batting average drop to .248 in 100 games. After the 1952 season, trade rumors reportedly had the Cleveland Indians offering the American League's runs batted in champion, Al Rosen, in exchange for Carrasquel but, the trade never transpired. In 1953, Carrasquel was once again voted as the starting shortstop for the American League in the 1953 All-Star Game and ended the season first among the league's shortstops in fielding percentage. During spring training in 1954, it was reported that White Sox manager Paul Richards was not pleased with Carrasquel's lack of effort on the field. It was a charge that would continue to pursue Carrasquel for the remainder of his tenure with the White Sox. Carrasquel responded with his most productive season in when, he was voted to make his third start as the American League shortstop in the 1954 All-Star Game and, posted career-highs in home runs (12), RBI (62), hits (158), runs (106), extra-base hits (43), walks (85). Batting as the White Sox leadoff hitter, he led the league in games played and in plate appearances while hitting for a .255 batting average. Defensively, he led the league's shortstops in double plays and in fielding percentage. In July 1955, new White Sox manager, Marty Marion, replaced Carrasquel in favor of shortstop Jim Brideweser, citing Carrasquel's lackadaisical efforts and indifferent attitude towards playing. There was some speculation among major league managers that, playing in the Venezuelan Winter League during the off-season might be wearing him down. Between spring training, the regular major league season, and then a season of winter baseball in Venezuela, Carrasquel was playing in approximately 300 games a year. Despite this setback, Carrasquel was still selected to his fourth All- Star game, this time as a reserve behind Harvey Kuenn. He still showed flashes of his former self as in a game against the Baltimore Orioles on August 23 when, he scored from first base on a bunt. Nellie Fox hit a bunt down the third base line and, when Orioles third baseman, Gus Triandos, left his base to field the ball, Carrasquel rounded second base and continued to third, where he was called safe on a close play. When the Orioles argued with the umpire without calling a time out, Carrasquel dashed to home plate without drawing a throw. Although his dedication was being called into question by Marion and the sporting press, Carrasquel still finished among the league leaders in assists, putouts and in fielding percentage. Carrasquel had been instrumental in helping the White Sox sign another young, Venezuelan shortstop named Luis Aparicio, who went on to become a perennial All-Star player and was eventually inducted into the Hall of Fame. By , Aparicio was deemed ready to play in the major leagues and, with Marion dissatisfied with Carrasquel's level of play, he was traded along with Jim Busby to the Cleveland Indians for Larry Doby in October of that year. After two and a half seasons with the Indians, Carrasquel was traded to the Kansas City Athletics for Billy Hunter in June 1958.Hunter goes to Indians for Chico He played half a season for the Athletics before they traded him to the Baltimore Orioles for Dick Williams in October 1958. On May 10, 1959, Carrasquel was hit above his left eye by a thrown baseball as he was running the base paths and had to be carried off the field. During a physical examination in September, it was discovered that Carrasquel only had fifty percent of his vision in his left eye, perhaps stemming from the May incident. He ended the year with a career-low .223 batting average and in December the Orioles released him. He became a free agent and signed a contract to play for the Chicago White Sox in January 1960 but was released at the beginning of the season. Carrasquel then signed with the Montreal Royals of the International League in April but was released after hitting for a .206 average in 35 games. Career statistics In a ten- year major league career, Carrasquel played in 1,325 games, accumulating 1,199 hits in 4,644 at bats for a .258 career batting average along with 55 home runs, 474 runs batted in and a .333 on-base percentage. He was a disciplined hitter, posting a solid 1.052 walk-to-strikeout ratio (491-to-467). A four- time All-Star, Carrasquel led the American League three times in fielding percentage, once in assists and finished his career with a .969 fielding percentage. Carrasquel had 5 hits and scored 5 runs in a game against the Kansas City Athletics on April 23, 1955. He also had two other games in which he had 5 hits. Carrasquel had a career-high 7 runs batted in during a game against the Athletics on April 26, 1956. Managing career and later life Carrasquel returned to his native Venezuela where continued to play in the Venezuelan Winter League until when, he retired as an active player at the age of 41. He later became the manager of the Leones del Caracas, leading them to the 1982 Caribbean Series championship title. Carrasquel also spent time as a scout for the Kansas City Royals and the New York Mets. He later worked as a color commentator on the White Sox' Spanish language broadcasts from to and, as the team's Community Relations Representative until . In , Carrasquel helped start a nonprofit foundation to help underprivileged children in Venezuela and the United States. The Chico Carrasquel Foundation transports barrio youngsters to YMCA centers, museums, baseball games, and historical places throughout Venezuela. Honors In , the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League honored Carrasquel by renaming the Puerto la Cruz baseball stadium as the Estadio Alfonso Chico Carrasquel. The VPBL also honors annually the best manager in the league with the Chico Carrasquel Award. In , Carrasquel was selected in the inaugural class of the Venezuelan Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. On the occasion of Ozzie Guill√©n's first home game as White Sox manager in the season, Carrasquel joined Guill√©n and fellow Venezuelans Luis Aparicio and Dave Concepci√≥n in throwing out the first ball at the home opener. Carrasquel called it his proudest moment. Legacy As the first Venezuelan to become a star player in Major League Baseball, Carrasquel became a national idol and was an influential figure in his native country. His accomplishments as a player influenced the aspirations of future Latin players including Aparicio and, helped pave the way for their baseball careers. Carrasquel's influence in Venezuela may have extended into the geopolitical arena as well. At a time during the cold war when communists threatened to destabilize the country, Walter Donnelly, the United States Ambassador to Venezuela, arranged for members of the Carrasquel family, Venezuelan sportswriters and ballplayers to come to Yankee Stadium for an International Day honoring Carrasquel in July . Donnelly Donnelly told Collier's magazine that he honestly believed the event was a setback for communist propagandists in Venezuela. Under no circumstances could a similar trip have been made to Russia or any of the satellite countries. Carrasquel's uncle, Alex Carrasquel, and his nephew Cris Col√≥n, also played in Major League Baseball. Carrasquel died of cardiac/respiratory arrest in Caracas, Venezuela on May 26, at the age of 77.

It was renamed Gospel Oak in 1867 when a new station more appropriately named Kentish Town was opened about a mile south on the same line (that station is now ). Due to financial constraints a planned connection from the Tottenham and Hampstead Junction Railway to Gospel Oak station was not added until 4 June 1888, some 20 years after that railway opened, and then without a link to the North London Line due to other companies' opposition. From 1926 to 1981, the station was not a passenger interchange: passenger trains left the Barking line at Tufnell Park and descended the gradient to station. In 1981 that passenger service from Barking was diverted from Kentish Town to Gospel Oak with the terminal platform rebuilt on the north side of the existing station. The North London Line through Gospel Oak was electrified on the fourth-rail 660 volt DC system in 1916 by the LNWR: in the 1970s that was changed to 750 volt DC third rail. In 1996, the line from Willesden through Gospel Oak to Camden was closed during conversion to 25 kv AC overhead. Design The platforms are high above street level with stairs and two lifts, one serving westbound trains, and one serving eastbound trains and the Barking line. The North London Line has two platforms and the Barking line has a short terminal platform north of which are two separate through freight tracks which join the NLL just west of the station. Oyster ticket barriers are in operation. Services London Overground Turbostar unit 172005 departs from Gospel Oak with a service to . Until 2018, the line was not fully electrified requiring diesel train operation. To allow four-car trains to run on the London Overground network, the North London Line between this station and closed from February 2010 to 1 June 2010, for installing a new signalling system and for extending 30 platforms. Until May 2011, there was a reduced service with no services on Sundays while the upgrade work continued.

Midfielders are generally positioned on the field between their team's defenders and forwards. Some midfielders play a disciplined defensive role, breaking up attacks, and are otherwise known as defensive midfielders. Others blur the boundaries, being more mobile and efficient in passing: they are commonly referred to as deep- lying midfielders, play-makers, box-to-box, or holding midfielders. The number of midfielders on a team and their assigned roles depends on the team's formation; the collective group of these players on the field is sometimes referred to as the midfield. Most managers assign at least one midfielder to disrupt the opposing team's attacks, while others may be tasked with creating goals, or have equal responsibilities between attack and defence. Midfielders are the players who typically travel the greatest distance during a match. Midfielders arguably have the most possession during a game, and thus they are among the fittest players on the pitch. Central midfielder Spain midfielder Xavi was voted to the FIFPro World XI eight years in a row. Central or centre midfielders are players whose role is divided roughly equally between attack and defence and to dominate the play around the centre of the pitch. These players will try to pass the ball to the team's attacking midfielders and forwards and may also help their team's attacks by making runs into the opposition's penalty area and attempting shots on goal themselves. When the opposing team has the ball, a central midfielder may drop back to protect the goal or move forward and press the opposition ball-carrier to recover the ball. A centre midfielder defending their goal will move in front of their centre-backs in order to block long shots by the opposition and possibly track opposition midfielders making runs towards the goal. The 4‚Äì3‚Äì3 and 4‚Äì5‚Äì1 formations each use three central midfielders. The 4‚àí4‚àí2 formation may use two central midfielders, and in the 4‚Äì2‚Äì3‚Äì1 formation one of the two deeper midfielders may be a central midfielder. =Box-to-box midfielder= The term box-to-box midfielder (shortened as BBM or B2B) refers to central midfielders who are hard-working and who have good all-round abilities, which makes them skilled at both defending and attacking. These players can therefore track back to their own box to make tackles and block shots and also carry the ball forward or run to the opponents' box to try to score. Beginning in the mid-2000s, the change of trends and the decline of the standard 4‚Äì4‚Äì2 formation (in many cases making way for the 4‚Äì2‚Äì3‚Äì1 and 4‚Äì3‚Äì3 formations) imposed restrictions on the typical box-to-box midfielders of the 1980s and 1990s, as teams' two midfield roles were now often divided into \\"holders\\" or \\"creators\\", with a third variation upon the role being described as that of a \\"carrier\\" or \\"surger\\". Notable examples of box-to-box midfielders are Steven Gerrard, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Yaya Tour√©, Arturo Vidal and Roy Keane. =Mezzala= In Italian football, the term mezzala (literally \\"half-winger\\" in Italian) is used to describe the position of the one or two central midfielders who flank a holding midfielder and/or playmaker. The term was initially applied to the role of an inside forward in the WM and Metodo formations in Italian, but later came to be used to describe a specific type of central midfielder. The mezzala is often a quick and hard-working attacking-minded midfielder, with good skills and noted offensive capabilities, as well as a tendency to make overlapping attacking runs, but also a player who participates in the defensive aspect of the game, and who can give width to a team by drifting out wide; as such, the term can be applied to several different roles. In English, the term has come to be seen as a variant of the box-to-box midfielder role. Wide midfielder Left and right midfielders have a role balanced between attack and defence, similar to that of central midfielders, but they are positioned closer to the touchlines of the pitch. They may be asked to cross the ball into the opponents' penalty area to make scoring chances for their teammates, and when defending they may put pressure on opponents who are trying to cross. Common modern formations that include left and right midfielders are the 4‚àí4‚àí2, the 4‚àí4‚àí1‚àí1, the 4‚Äì2‚Äì3‚Äì1 and the 4‚àí5‚àí1 formations. Jonathan Wilson describes the development of the 4‚àí4‚àí2 formation: \\"‚Ä¶the winger became a wide midfielder, a shuttler, somebody who might be expected to cross a ball but was also meant to put in a defensive shift.\\" Notable examples of wide midfielders are David Beckham and Ryan Giggs. Metodo formation: the wing-halves (yellow) occupy a more defensive position supporting the inside forwards. In Italian football, the role of the wide midfielder is known as tornante di centrocampo or simply tornante (\\"returning\\"); it originated from the role of an outside forward, and came to be known as such as it often required players in this position to track back and assist the back-line with defensive duties, in addition to aiding the midfield and attacking. =Wing-half= The historic position of wing-half (not to be confused with mezzala) was given to midfielders (half-backs) who played near the side of the pitch. It became obsolete as wide players with defensive duties have tended to become more a part of the defence as full- backs. Defensive midfielder Spain holding midfielder Sergio Busquets (16, red) moves to block a shot from Mario Balotelli. Defensive midfielders are midfield players who focus on protecting their team's goal. These players may defend a zone in front of their team's defence, or man mark specific opposition attackers. Defensive midfielders may also move to the full-back or centre-back positions if those players move forward to join in an attack. Sergio Busquets described his attitude: \\"The coach knows that I am an obedient player who likes to help out and if I have to run to the wing to cover someone's position, great.\\" A good defensive midfielder needs good positional awareness, anticipation of opponent's play, marking, tackling, interceptions, passing and great stamina and strength (for their tackling). In South American football, this role is known as a volante de marca (\\"steering wheel,\\" in Spanish), while in Mexico it is known as volante de contenci√≥n. In Portugal, it is instead known as trinco. =Holding midfielder= A holding or deep- lying midfielder stays close to their team's defence, while other midfielders may move forward to attack. The holding midfielder may also have responsibilities when their team has the ball. This player will make mostly short and simple passes to more attacking members of their team but may try some more difficult passes depending on the team's strategy. Marcelo Bielsa is considered as a pioneer for the use of a holding midfielder in defence. This position may be seen in the 4‚Äì2‚Äì3‚Äì1 and 4‚Äì4‚Äì2 diamond formations. Initially, a defensive midfielder, or \\"destroyer\\", and a playmaker, or \\"creator\\", were often fielded alongside each other as a team's two holding central midfielders. The destroyer was usually responsible for making tackles, regaining possession, and distributing the ball to the creator, while the creator was responsible for retaining possession and keeping the ball moving, often with long passes out to the flanks, in the manner of a more old- fashioned deep-lying playmaker or regista (see below). Early examples of a destroyer are Nobby Stiles, Herbert Wimmer, Marco Tardelli, while later examples include Claude Mak√©l√©l√© and Javier Mascherano, although several of these players also possessed qualities of other types of midfielders, and were therefore not confined to a single role. Early examples of a creator would be G√©rson, Glenn Hoddle, and Sunday Oliseh, while more recent examples are Xabi Alonso and Michael Carrick. The latest and third type of holding midfielder developed as a box-to-box midfielder, or \\"carrier\\" or \\"surger\\", neither entirely destructive nor creative, who is capable of winning back possession and subsequently advancing from deeper positions either by distributing the ball to a teammate and making late runs into the box, or by carrying the ball him or herself; recent examples of this type of player are Clarence Seedorf and Bastian Schweinsteiger, while Sami Khedira and Fernandinho are destroyers with carrying tendencies, Luka Modriƒá is a carrier with several qualities of the regista, and Yaya Tour√© was a carrier who became a playmaker, in later part of his career, after losing his stamina. =Deep-lying playmaker= Italian deep-lying playmaker Andrea Pirlo executing a pass. Pirlo is often regarded as one of the best deep-lying playmakers of all time. A deep-lying playmaker is a holding midfielder who specializes in ball skills such as passing, rather than defensive skills like tackling. When this player has the ball, they may attempt longer or more complex passes than other holding players. They may try to set the tempo of their team's play, retain possession, or build plays through short exchanges, or they may try to pass the ball long to a centre forward or winger, or even pass short to a teammate in the hole, the area between the opponents' defenders and midfielders. In Italy, the deep-lying playmaker is known as a regista, whereas in Brazil, it is known as a \\"meia-armador\\". In Italy, the role of the regista developed from the centre half-back or centromediano metodista position in Vittorio Pozzo's metodo system (a precursor of the central or holding midfield position in the 2‚Äì3‚Äì2‚Äì3 formation), as the metodista 's responsibilities were not entirely defensive but also creative; as such, the metodista was not solely tasked with breaking down possession, but also with starting attacking plays after winning back the ball. Writer Jonathan Wilson instead described Xabi Alonso's holding midfield role as that of a \\"creator\\", a player who was responsible for retaining possession in the manner of a more old-fashioned deep-lying playmaker or regista, noting that: \\"although capable of making tackles, [Alonso] focused on keeping the ball moving, occasionally raking long passes out to the flanks to change the angle of attack.\\" 2‚Äì3‚Äì5 formation: the wing- halves (yellow) flank the centre half. =Centre-half= The historic central half-back position gradually retreated from the midfield line to provide increased protection to the back‚Äìline against centre-forwards ‚Äì that dedicated defensive role in the centre is still commonly referred to as a \\"centre-half\\" as a legacy of its origins. In Italian football jargon, this position was known as the centromediano metodista or metodista, although this term was later also applied to describe players who operated in a central holding-midfielder role, but who also had creative responsibilities in addition to defensive duties. Attacking midfielder An 'attacking milo midfielder' is a midfield player who is positioned in an advanced midfield position, usually between central midfield and the team's forwards, and who has a primarily offensive role. Some attacking midfielders are called trequartista or fantasisti (, i.e. a creative playmaker between the forwards and the midfield), who are usually mobile, creative and highly skillful players, known for their deft touch, vision, ability to shoot from range, and passing prowess. However, not all attacking midfielders are trequartistas ‚Äì some attacking midfielders are very vertical and are essentially auxiliary attackers who serve to link-up play, hold up the ball, or provide the final pass, i.e. secondary strikers. According to positioning along the field, attacking midfield may be divided into left, right and central attacking midfield roles but mostly important he is a striker behind the forwards. A central attacking midfielder may be referred to as a playmaker, or number ten (due to the association of the number 10 shirt with this position). A good attacking midfielder needs good passing abilities, vision, the ability to make long shots, and solid dribbling skills. =Advanced playmaker= Italian offensive playmaker Francesco Totti in action for Roma in 2013 These players typically serve as the offensive pivot of the team, and are sometimes said to be \\"playing in the hole\\", although this term can also be used as deep-lying forward. The attacking midfielder is an important position that requires the player to possess superior technical abilities in terms of passing and dribbling, as well as, perhaps more importantly, the ability to read the opposing defence in order to deliver defence-splitting passes to the striker. This specialist midfielder's main role is to create good shooting and goal- scoring opportunities using superior vision, control, and technical skill, by making crosses, through balls, and headed knockdowns to teammates. They may try to set up shooting opportunities for themselves by dribbling or performing a give-and-go with a teammate. Attacking midfielders may also make runs into the opponents' penalty area in order to shoot from another teammate's pass. Where a creative attacking midfielder, i.e. an advanced playmaker, is regularly utilized, he or she is commonly the team's star player, and often wears the number 10 shirt. As such, a team is often constructed so as to allow their attacking midfielder to roam free and create as the situation demands. One such popular formation is the 4‚Äì4‚Äì2 \\"diamond\\" (or 4‚Äì1‚Äì2‚Äì1‚Äì2), in which defined attacking and defensive midfielders replace the more traditional pair of central midfielders. Known as the \\"fantasista\\" or \\"trequartista\\" in Italy, in Brazil, the offensive playmaker is known as the \\"meia atacante,\\" whereas in Argentina and Uruguay, it is known as the \\"enganche.\\" Examples of the advanced playmaker would be Zico, Zinedine Zidane, Juan Riquelme, Alessandro del Piero, Francesco Totti and, more recently, David Silva. =False attacking midfielder= The false attacking midfielder description has been used in Italian football to describe a player who is seemingly playing as an attacking midfielder in a 4‚Äì3‚Äì1‚Äì2 formation, but who eventually drops deeper into midfield, drawing opposing players out of position and creating space to be exploited by teammates making attacking runs; the false-attacking midfielder will eventually sit in a central midfield role and function as a deep-lying playmaker. The false-attacking midfielder is therefore usually a creative and tactically intelligent player with good vision, technique, movement, passing ability, and striking ability from distance. He or she should also be a hard- working player, who is able to read the game and help the team defensively. = \\"False 10\\" or \\"central winger\\"= The \\"false 10\\" or \\"central winger\\" is a type of midfielder, which differs from the false-attacking midfielder. Much like the \\"false 9,\\" their specificity lies in the fact that, although they seemingly play as an attacking midfielder on paper, unlike a traditional playmaker who stays behind the striker in the centre of the pitch, the false 10's goal is to move out of position and drift wide when in possession of the ball to help both the wingers and fullbacks to overload the flanks. This means two problems for the opposing midfielders: either they let the false 10 drift wide, and their presence, along with both the winger and the fullback, creates a three-on-two player advantage out wide; or they follow the false 10, but leave space in the centre of the pitch for wingers or onrushing midfielders to exploit. False 10s are usually traditional wingers who are told to play in the centre of the pitch, and their natural way of playing makes them drift wide and look to provide deliveries into the box for teammates. On occasion, the false-10 can also function in a different manner alongside a false-9, usually in a 4‚Äì6‚Äì0 formation, disguised as either a 4‚Äì3‚Äì3 or 4‚Äì2‚Äì3‚Äì1 formation. When other forwards or false-9s drop deep and draw defenders away from the false-10s, creating space in the middle of the pitch, the false-10 will then also surprise defenders by exploiting this space and moving out of position once again, often undertaking offensive dribbling runs forward towards goal, or running on to passes from false-9s, which in turn enables them to create goalscoring opportunities or go for goal themselves. Winger In modern football, the terms winger or wide player refer to a non-defender who plays on the left or right sides of the pitch. These terms can apply to left or right midfielders, left or right attacking midfielders, or left or right forwards. Left or right-sided defenders such as wing-backs or full-backs are generally not called wingers. In the 2‚àí3‚àí5 formation popular in the late 19th century wingers remained mostly near the touchlines of the pitch, and were expected to cross the ball for the team's inside and centre forwards. Traditionally, wingers were purely attacking players and were not expected to track back and defend. This began to change in the 1960s. In the 1966 World Cup, England manager Alf Ramsey did not select wingers from the quarter-final onwards. This team was known as the \\"Wingless Wonders\\" and led to the modern 4‚Äì4‚Äì2 formation. This has led to most modern wide players having a more demanding role in the sense that they are expected to provide defensive cover for their full-backs and track back to repossess the ball, as well as provide skillful crosses for centre forwards and strikers. Some forwards are able to operate as wingers behind a lone striker. In a three-man midfield, specialist wingers are sometimes deployed down the flanks alongside the central midfielder or playmaker. Even more demanding is the role of wing-back, where the wide player is expected to provide both defence and attack. As the role of winger can be classed as a forward or a midfielder, this role blurs the divide between defender and midfielder. On occasion, the role of a winger can also be occupied by a different type of player. For example, certain managers have been known to use a \\"wide target man\\" on the wing, namely a large and physical player who usually plays as a centre-forward, and who will attempt to win aerial challenges and hold up the ball on the flank, or drag full-backs out of position; Romelu Lukaku, for example, has been used in this role on occasion. Another example is Mario Mand≈æukiƒá under manager Massimiliano Allegri at Juventus during the 2016‚Äì17 season; normally a striker, he was instead used on the left flank, and was required to win aerial duels, hold up the ball, and create space, as well as being tasked with pressing opposing players. Wingers are indicated in red, while the \\"wide men\\" (who play to the flanks of the central midfielders) are indicated in blue. Today, a winger is usually an attacking midfielder who is stationed in a wide position near the touchlines. Wingers such as Stanley Matthews or Jimmy Johnstone used to be classified as outside forwards in traditional W-shaped formations, and were formally known as \\"Outside Right\\" or \\"Outside Left,\\" but as tactics evolved through the last 40 years, wingers have dropped to deeper field positions and are now usually classified as part of the midfield, usually in 4‚Äì4‚Äì2 or 4‚Äì5‚Äì1 formations (but while the team is on the attack, they tend to resemble 4‚Äì2‚Äì4/2‚Äì4‚Äì4 and 4‚Äì3‚Äì3 formations respectively). The responsibilities of the winger include: * Providing a \\"wide presence\\" as a passing option on the flank. * To beat the opposing full-back either with skill or with speed. * To read passes from the midfield that give them a clear crossing opportunity, when going wide, or that give them a clear scoring opportunity, when cutting inside towards goal. * To double up on the opposition winger, particularly when he or she is being \\"double-marked\\" by both the team's full back and winger. The prototypical winger is fast, tricky and enjoys 'hugging' the touchline, that is, running downfield close to the touchline and delivering crosses. However, players with different attributes can thrive on the wing as well. Some wingers prefer to cut infield (as opposed to staying wide) and pose a threat as playmakers by playing diagonal passes to forwards or taking a shot at goal. Even players who are not considered quick, have been successfully fielded as wingers at club and international level for their ability to create play from the flank. Occasionally wingers are given a free role to roam across the front line and are relieved of defensive responsibilities. The typical abilities of wingers include: * Technical skill to beat a full-back in a one-to-one situation. * Pace, to beat the full-back one-on-one. * Crossing ability when out wide. * Good off-the-ball ability when reading a pass from the midfield or from fellow attackers. * Good passing ability and composure, to retain possession while in opposition territory. * The modern winger should also be comfortable on either wing so as to adapt to quick tactical changes required by the coach. Although wingers are a familiar part of football, the use of wingers is by no means universal. There are many successful football teams who operate without wingers. A famous example is Carlo Ancelotti's late 2000s Milan, who typically play in a narrow midfield diamond formation or in a Christmas tree formation (4‚Äì3‚Äì2‚Äì1), relying on full-backs to provide the necessary width down the wings. =Inverted winger= Midfielder Arjen Robben has been deployed as an inverted winger throughout his career. An inverted winger is a modern tactical development of the traditional winger position. Most wingers are assigned to either side of the field based on their footedness, with right-footed players on the right and left-footed players on the left. This assumes that assigning a player to their natural side ensures a more powerful cross as well as greater ball-protection along the touch-lines. However, when the position is inverted and a winger instead plays inside-out on the opposite flank (i.e., a right-footed player as a left inverted winger), they effectively become supporting strikers and primarily assume a role in the attack. As opposed to traditionally pulling the opponent's full-back out and down the flanks before crossing the ball in near the by-line, positioning a winger on the opposite side of the field allows him or her to cut-in around the 18-yard box, either threading passes between defenders or taking a shot on goal using his or her dominant foot. This offensive tactic has found popularity in the modern game due to the fact that it gives traditional wingers increased mobility as playmakers and goalscorers, such as the left-footed right winger Domenico Berardi of Sassuolo who achieved 30 career goals faster than any player in the past half-century of Serie A football. Not only are inverted wingers able to push full-backs onto their weak sides, but they are also able to spread and force the other team to defend deeper as forwards and wing-backs route towards the goal, ultimately creating more scoring opportunities. Other midfielders within this tactical archetype include Lionel Messi and Eden Hazard, as well as Megan Rapinoe of the USWNT. Clubs such as Real Madrid often choose to play their wingers on the \\"wrong\\" flank for this reason; former Real Madrid coach Jos√© Mourinho often played √Ångel Di Mar√≠a on the right and Cristiano Ronaldo on the left. Former Bayern Munich manager Jupp Heynckes often played the left- footed Arjen Robben on the right and the right-footed Franck Rib√©ry on the left. One of the foremost practitioners of playing from either flank was German winger J√ºrgen Grabowski, whose flexibility helped Germany to third place in the 1970 World Cup, and the world title in 1974. A description that has been used in the media to label a variation upon the inverted winger position is that of an \\"attacking,\\" \\"false,\\" or \\"goalscoring winger,\\" as exemplified by Cristiano Ronaldo's role on the left flank during his time at Real Madrid in particular. This label has been used to describe an offensive‚Äìminded inverted winger, who will seemingly operate out wide on paper, but who instead will be given the freedom to make unmarked runs into more advanced central areas inside the penalty area, in order to get on the end of passes and crosses and score goals, effectively functioning as a striker. This role is somewhat comparable to what is known as the raumdeuter role in German football jargon (literally \\"space interpreter\\"), as exemplified by Thomas M√ºller, namely an attacking‚Äìminded wide player, who will move into central areas in order to find spaces from which he can receive passes and score or assist goals, even though he isn't very sharp at finishing nor is he technically creative. =False winger= The \\"false winger\\" or \\"seven‚Äìand‚Äìa‚Äìhalf\\" is a label which has been used to describe a type of player who normally plays centrally, but who instead is deployed out wide on paper; during the course of a match, however, they will move inside and operate in the centre of the pitch, in order to drag defenders out of position, congest the midfield and give their team a numerical advantage in this area, so that they can dominate possession in the middle of the pitch and create chances for the forwards; this position also leaves space for full-backs to make overlapping attacking runs up the flank. Samir Nasri, who has been deployed in this role, once described it as that of a \\"non-axial playmaker.\\" See also *Association football positions References External links * * Category:Association football positions Category:Association football terminology Category:Association football player non-biographical articles ","title":"Midfielder"},{"id":"548990","text":"Aureolus (died 268) was a Roman military commander and would-be usurper. He was one of the so-called Thirty Tyrants who populated the reign of the Emperor Gallienus. Of humble Daco-Roman origins, he was 'made' by the Emperor Gallienus and proved himself to be one of the most brilliant and innovative soldiers of the age. However, he later turned against his benefactor, and was destroyed in the political turmoil that surrounded the Emperor's assassination in a conspiracy orchestrated by his senior officers. The ancient sources which refer to Aureolus are limited and the information they do provide is often contradictory. They include the Historia Augusta, Zonaras' epitome and Zosimus' Historia Nova. His career was most recently summarised in John Bray's biography of Gallienus. The analysis of Aureolus's career given here, especially his final rebellion, is largely based on Bray. Early life and career There is no way of determining his date of birth, but given that he was at the height of his powers in the later 250s and 260s AD he is likely to have been born by 230 at the latest. Zonaras says that he was a herdsmanZonaras, Op. Cit. xii, 24. born in the Roman province of Dacia, north of the Danube. It may be conjectured that, like many Dacians, he enlisted in the Roman Army as a young man and had the good fortune to come to the attention of the Emperor Gallienus. His first job was said to have been as a groom. If so, he must have been a good one, because we first encounter him as Master of the Imperial Horses ('Phronistes') according to Zonaras. The exact meaning of this term is yet unclear. Does it mean that he was Gallienus's Head Groom or does it refer to his later position as commander of Gallienus's cavalry army? (see below). He was said to have been ambidextrous which is doubtless a useful skill for a groom, but may also be a commentary on his untrustworthy character as interpreted by later historians. Throughout his reign Gallienus was always willing to promote talent wherever he found it, and Aureolus was one of the most brilliant of the New Men who were replacing senators in positions of high command in the army in the course of his reign. With Gallienus As Imperial Horsemaster Aureolus would have been well- placed to work with Gallienus in formulating and developing the concept of a self-contained cavalry force to beef up the effectiveness of the comitatus as a highly mobile field army under the Emperor's direct control. Aureolus was the first commander of this force under the Emperor. It was based at Mediolanum (Milan). Aureolus first made his mark in history in 258 (or 260‚Äîthe date is uncertain) when his cavalry was principally responsible for the defeat of the usurper Ingenuus at the Battle of Mursa (Osijek in Croatia). In 261 he commanded the force which defeated the army of the usurpers Macrianus Major and Macrianus Minor in battle somewhere in the central Balkans. As the army of the Macriani, which was swollen by the garrisons of the Danubian provinces that were obviously still seething with the resentments that had caused them to support first Ingenuus and then Regalianus, was probably at least 30,000 strong it would have required more than Aureolus's cavalry alone to challenge it. In any case Gallienus seems to have given Aureolus a free hand in crushing the rebels and entrusted him with a force that proved sufficient for the purpose. As to why Aureolus is credited with suppressing the Macriani as a major challenge to Gallienus's rule rather than the Emperor himself there are two possible explanations: (1) The determination of the Latin historians to denigrate the achievements of Gallienus; however, a more likely explanation is that (2) Gallienus was attempting at this time to crush the Gallic usurper Postumus who he probably saw as an even greater threat to his regime than the Macriani and to clear the Juthungi out of the Alpine province of Raetia where they posed a direct threat to Italy and Rome. (In any case, Postumus had been principally responsible for the murder of Gallienus's son, the Caesar Saloninus, which made their dispute highly personal in a way that with the Macriani was not). Against Gallienus After the Macriani were defeated and the Danubian garrison forces who had supported them were pacified, Aureolus accompanied the Emperor in (another?) attempt to crush Postumus and his Gallic Empire. It may have been as a result of this campaign that the province of Raetia was recovered from the Gallic Empire (which had driven out the Juthungi where Gallienus seems to have failed) and Postumus's inscription on the Augsburg Altar was erased. However, Postumus managed to evade complete defeat thanks to the supposed 'carelessness' of Aureolus. It is often implied that even at this stage Aureolus was willing to see Gallienus displaced as Emperor and that he deliberately allowed the Gallic usurper to evade destruction. Zosimus (1.41) reports that Aureolus and two other officers conspired against Gallienus, but that all of them were punished and submitted, except Aureolus, who retained his anger against the emperor. It is now impossible to determine what lies behind this reference. Perhaps, as a Dacian, Aureolus resented Gallienus's policy of withdrawing elements of the Dacian garrison to reinforce his field army for the defence of Italy thus compounding the problems of barbarian incursions into Dacia. Such resentment may well have enabled Aureolus to persuade himself that Gallienus had forfeited his heaven-sent mandate to rule. However, this is pure speculation unsupported by any direct evidence as to what motivated Aureolus. At any event, whether or not he indulged in an unsuccessful conspiracy, Aureolus does seem to have lost the confidence of Gallienus as a result of his failure to destroy Postumus in Gaul even though he was not brought to trial nor dismissed from the Imperial service for that dereliction of duty. He had been given sole responsibility for the campaign against the Macriani, yet when the Goths and Heruls invaded the Danubian provinces with an enormous force in 268, Aureolus was not even a senior officer of the Imperial comitatus that accompanied the Emperor against the marauders. He was not even left in Milan to mind the shop against Postumus. He seems instead to have been made commander of the Raetian garrison while his cavalry went east with the Emperor under the command of Claudius (later the Emperor Claudius Gothicus) or Aurelian who also became Emperor in due course. Losing command of the elite cavalry he had done so much to create and had once led so brilliantly must have seemed a humiliating demotion for Aureolus. That it distinguished itself still further in the campaign against the Goths (especially at the battle of Nessus (the River Nestus that divided the provinces of Macedonia and Thrace) was no doubt additionally galling. (Post hoc ergo propter hoc (?) Aureolus confirmed his disaffection from Gallienus by deserting his Alpine command, and invading Italy where he took his old base, Milan. This was an act of the very highest treason and meant that Gallienus had to break off his campaign against the Goths in the Balkans at a most critical moment to return to Italy to deal with him. However, it may be that the long-term consequences of Aureolus's rebellion were even more serious in that it opened Raetia to further invasion by the Alamanni who then went on to raid in force into Italy itself next year in the early months of the reign of Claudius Gothicus. It may have been at this time that the Agri Decumates, the Roman lands north-east of the upper Rhine were lost for good. From Milan Aureolus invited Postumus to challenge Gallienus for the Empire with his support. Using the Imperial mint in Milan he had coins struck bearing Postumus's image as Emperor with appeals to the faith of his former comrades of the cavalry on the reverse. This seems to have been Aureolus's idea alone for Postumus never tried to suborn the loyalty of the cavalry in this way. In any event, Postumus ignored his invitation and Aureolus, unsupported by the Gallic usurper, was defeated by Gallienus in a battle on the river Adda east of Milan at a place known for centuries as Pontirolo (from Latin Pons Aureoli i.e. 'The Bridge of Aureolus'). He was then besieged in Milan which was invested by Gallienus's military comitatus (including, it would seem, the cavalry which Aureolus had been largely instrumental in creating and to loyalty of which he now appealed in vain). It cannot be certain what Aureolus's motives were in staging his desperate coup against Gallienus. It may have been sheer resentment at his demotion after the unsuccessful attack on Postumus combined with a belief that Gallienus's military policies had undermined the defences of Dacia and the Illyrian provinces. Admittedly, if indeed he had deliberately let Postumus off the hook, he would have been very lucky to escape with his life under almost any other Roman Emperor rather than be rewarded with another significant command. Military ambition quite often exceeded gratitude in Gallienus's reign. However, the conspiracy by the Praetorian Prefect, together with Aurelius Heraclianus, Claudius and Aurelian that was to cost Gallienus his life suggests that there was a growing belief at the highest level of the army in the later 260s that the Emperor was no longer fit to rule and Aureolus may well have shared these sentiments. Death When Gallienus was murdered it is possible Aureolus made his own bid for the Purple if a rather obscure issue of coinage is to be believed. However, as Aureolus had earlier offered his allegiance to Postumus it seems likely that he made this last defiant gesture‚Äîif indeed he did make it‚Äîonly when Postumus failed to take advantage of the turmoil in Italy. Aureolus's end came when he surrendered to Claudius Gothicus who had by this time succeeded Gallienus as Emperor after the latter was assassinated in a 'Marshals' Plot' in which Claudius was almost certainly a prime mover. However, apparently before Claudius could decide what to do with him, Aureolus was murdered by Claudius's Praetorian Guard, supposedly in revenge for Aureolus's rebellion against Gallienus which had evoked great fury in the ranks of the Imperial comitatus which obviously did not share the treasonable disloyalty to that Emperor's regime of its most senior officers. The question might be asked, if they were thus infuriated by Aureolus who had merely rebelled against Gallienus‚Äîsomething a good many self-respecting senior soldiers had attempted during his turbulent reign‚Äîwhy did they not exact similar vengeance on his actual murderers? It could well be that the moral authority over the army exercised by Claudius, Heraclianus, Aurelian et al. who, however tainted by treason, had at least shown themselves as resolute defenders of the Empire in numerous wars against its barbaric foes, was of a different order to that enjoyed by Aureolus after his suspicious failure to finish off Postumus after his victory over the Macriani. However, it is also possible to suggest that the action of Claudius's Praetorians in taking it upon themselves to dispose of Aureolus would have been very convenient if their master wanted to obliterate any evidence of treasonable links between Aureolus and Gallienus's murderers. Against this one might wonder why Gallienus's treacherous marshals would see any benefit in associating themselves with damaged goods such as Aureolus. Sometimes the simplest explanations are most persuasive. Aureolus was murdered by furious soldiers who were then persuaded to turn a blind eye to the likely greater culpability of their new leader‚Äîno doubt convinced in the end by the generous donative he was able to offer them. In the end we do not know and will never know what motivated the men of the Imperial Comitatus or their leaders in 268 AD.

It is in length from one terminus to the other and carries both through goods trains and London Overground passenger trains, connecting Gospel Oak station in north London and Barking station in east London. The line is part of Network Rail Strategic Route 6, and is classified as a London and South East Commuter line. For much of its existence the line has played a minor role in London's transport system; however in recent years it has received significant investment to increase its capacity, including full 25kV AC overhead electrification, completed in 2018. At the eastern end of the line, an extension to the Barking Riverside regeneration site is currently under construction, and is planned to open in 2021. History A 1914 map of the Tottenham and Hampstead Junction Railway = Original lines = The line has existed in its current form since 1981, and is mostly an amalgamation of lines built in the 19th century. The main section, between South Tottenham and Woodgrange Park, was built as the Tottenham and Forest Gate Railway, a joint project between the Midland Railway and the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway. This opened on 9 July 1894, linking the Midland and Great Eastern joint line at South Tottenham and the Forest Gate and Barking line at Woodgrange Park. The section west of South Tottenham was built as the Tottenham and Hampstead Junction Railway, which opened in 1868 but had not been commercially successful as a stand-alone railway. = Predecessor routes = Although the route between Upper Holloway and Woodgrange Park has been constant, several stations have been the ends of the line. , , and Moorgate (via St Pancras) have all been the western termini. East Ham was an alternative eastern terminus for some time. Some trains were extended beyond Barking to destinations such as Southend and Tilbury. There was a regular boat train service between St Pancras and Tilbury. A connection to Gospel Oak was added in 1888, but the routes via Kentish Town remained the primary ones and the Gospel Oak branch was abandoned in 1926. The connection to East Ham was abandoned in 1958. The Tottenham and Hampstead Junction Railway section of the line had stations that were closed due to proximity to other stations or for other reasons. These include Highgate Road (closed 1918), Junction Road (closed 1943), Hornsey Road (closed 1943) and St Ann's Road (closed 1942). The line was considered for closure to passengers in 1963 as part of the Beeching Axe, but local users protested and formed an action group to prevent closure. Beeching's proposals for London were not implemented for the most part, and the line remained open. Even so, it was allowed to fall into a poor state of repair and reliability, and by 1980 had been cut back to an hourly service between Kentish Town and Barking. The station canopies were gradually demolished, ticket offices closed and staff withdrawn from stations. = Introduction of the present route = The situation began to improve in 1981 when electrification and upgrades to the line out of (later part of Thameslink) displaced the line from Kentish Town. A new link to Gospel Oak was built and the hourly service from Kentish Town was replaced by the current route from Gospel Oak with two trains per hour. The service remained very unreliable due to the age of the trains, which were initially Class 115 and 108 units, replaced in the early 1990s by class 117 and 121 units. = Private operators = A Silverlink Class 150 at Gospel Oak Initially part of British Rail Network SouthEast, the line was privatised in 1994, the track being owned by Railtrack (subsequently Network Rail) with the passenger service provided by the North London Railways franchise. This passed to National Express in 1997, which operated the line under the brand name Silverlink until November 2007. Under Silverlink, the slam door trains were replaced by Class 150 units in 2000, which improved reliability significantly. There were minor improvements in station facilities (such as CCTV and information points) but no major investment to upgrade the line and boost capacity, and the stations remained unstaffed. = London Overground = left Many lines within London were running at full capacity, and as a consequence the line took on a new strategic significance as a by-pass, relieving load on other lines by allowing passengers to travel between north and east London directly. The Railways Act 2005 abolished the franchise and gave the operation of passenger services to Transport for London (TfL). In 2005, TfL started funding a small number of additional peak time and late evening services to relieve the worst overcrowding. TfL took full control in November 2007 introducing improved late night and weekend services, and staff, ticket machines and Oyster equipment at all stations. The frequency was increased to three trains per hour during morning and afternoon peaks and the line was included on the Tube map for the first time. The line was closed throughout most of September 2008 for upgrade work carried out by Network Rail. Capacity was increased from six trains per hour to eight (four each for passenger and goods trains). By replacing the overbridges carrying Sussex Way and Albert Road, and lowering the track in some other locations, it was made possible for W10 loading gauge goods trains to operate. Electrification was not included. In 2010 eight new Class 172 Turbostar diesel trains replaced the Class 150 units, with two 23-metre coaches and the option to introduce a third coach. The service frequency was increased to four trains per hour in January 2011. Given the completion of electrification in 2018, new electric Class 710 trains were supposed to run from March 2018. The delivery of the trains was delayed by the manufacturer however and it was not known at that time when these units would enter service. Due to the class 172 units being needed by West Midlands Trains, three Class 378 units (378 206, 378 209 and 378 232) were moved from other parts of the London Overground and shortened down from five to four carriages to provide an interim service until the class 710 units entered service. However, 6 trains are needed to be able to run a full service, so from 15 March 2019 (the day the last class 172 units left London Overground) the frequency on the line was halved to two trains per hour. On 23 May 2019 the first two class 710 units entered service but the existing two trains per hour service was maintained until the full timetable was restored in June of that year. All eight of the new class 710 units were deployed by August 2019, with TfL offering a month's free travel to compensate passengers. = Electrification = The electrified stretch at South Tottenham In 2008, electrification was ruled out on grounds of cost and difficulty of electrifying a line with so many viaducts and bridges, but the Network Route Utilisation Strategy published by Network Rail in October 2009 showed a benefit‚Äìcost ratio for the scheme of 2.4:1. In 2012, the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, indicated that funding was \\"a matter for the Department for Transport\\". In 2011, Network Rail proposed electrification in Control Period 5 (CP5), but in July 2012 Justine Greening, the Secretary of State for Transport, stated that electrification was not included in the High Level Output Specification for CP5, and that any funds would need to be provided by TfL. In August, the Mayor wrote to the Secretary of State for Transport to seek a way forward, and \\"she committed her officials to support work with TfL, Network Rail, train operators and other industry parties to see if a viable way can be found to bridge the funding gap.\\" In November 2012, the magazine Modern Railways reported that the Department for Transport had ruled out the work on the basis of an estimated cost of ¬£90 million, in contrast to an estimate of ¬£40M by TfL. It was announced in June 2013 that ¬£115M of funding for electrification was being made available as part of upgrades to rail infrastructure included in the government's 2013 spending round. At the same time Transport for London announced that they had obtained a ¬£90M commitment from the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Transport. In September 2015, Network Rail awarded the ¬£56.9M contract to electrify the line to J. Murphy & Sons. There were part closures (at weekends and from South Tottenham to Barking) from June to late September 2016, followed by a full closure from October to February 2017. In February 2017, Network Rail announced that whilst the line would re-open as scheduled, they were not able to complete all the work planned due to \\"incorrect\\" designs and late delivery of materials. Further evening and weekend works until late June 2017 were already planned, followed by around four months of commissioning work before the electric wires could be turned on so that Class 710 trains could run. Although the line was completely electrified by mid-January 2018, delays prevented the introduction of new electric trains until 2019. The line was electrified using the NR Series 2 OLE range. = Longer trains = A new Class 710 four-coach electric train at Barking station Increases in passenger numbers led to severe overcrowding at peak times, but it was not possible to increase peak frequencies without reducing the number of goods trains, as the line could accommodate only eight trains per hour in each direction. The two- coach Class 172 diesel trains in use between 2010 and 2019 were incapable of handling the increased number of passengers experienced after the incorporation into the London Overground. Between 2016 and 2018 the line was electrified by Network Rail; this work was delayed due to a number of design, track works and delivery problems. At the same time, platforms were lengthened to accommodate the new four-coach electric Class 710 trains. These trains were intended to be introduced in the spring of 2018, but the delivery was delayed by the manufacturer, the first two entering service on 23 May 2019, with the full fleet entering service in August 2019. Because the delay caused timetable cutbacks and continued overcrowding, TfL offered a month's free travel, financed by the manufacturer Bombardier, to compensate passengers for the months of disruption they experienced. =Accidents and incidents= *On 23 January 2020, a freight wagon derailed between Leyton Midland Road and Walthamstow Queens Road stations, causing extensive damage to more than 2.5 miles (4km) of track; the line was closed between Barking and South Tottenham stations while repair works took place, whereby 10,000 tonnes of ballast, 5,300 concrete sleepers and 39 new pieces of rail were installed. The line re- opened on 19 February 2020. Current operations The line is owned and maintained by Network Rail as part of Great Britain's national rail network. It carries both goods and passenger traffic. Passenger services on the line are operated by Arriva Rail London as part of the London Overground network under contract to TfL. There are four trains per hour in each direction Monday to Saturday from about 06:30 to about 2330, and on Sundays until about 22:00. Arriva wins ¬£1.5bn London Overground contract BBC News 18 March 2016Transport for London announces intention to award London Overground contract to Arriva Arriva 18 March 2016TfL confirm London Overground contract with Arriva signed Railway Technology Magazine 18 April 2016 There is also single weekday morning service from Woodgrange Park to Willesden Junction, calling at all intermediate stations except for Gospel Oak. Freight services are operated by DB Cargo UK, GB Railfreight and Freightliner. The line is heavily used by freight as it provides part of an orbital route around London, connecting with many radial routes and the North London Line at Gospel Oak. Other services that use parts of the line infrequently and as a diversionary route, but do not call intermediately: * c2c: a few services on the east end of the line through Woodgrange Park * London Overground: A single Saturday service is timetabled to connect Tottenham South Junction and Seven Sisters on Lea Valley routes via South Tottenham station The line has an active users' group, \\"The Barking ‚Äì Gospel Oak Rail User Group\\". =Ticketing= Except at the interchange stations, staffed ticket offices were withdrawn by BR in the late 1980s. Under London Overground, self-service ticket machines were introduced in November 2007. Oyster / contactless card validators (for touching in and out) are at all stations. The ticket machines can be used to load credit onto Oyster cards. Passengers are required to buy tickets or touch in their Oyster/contactless cards, or else face a penalty fare. Owing to the lack of ticket barriers and the difficulty of ticket verification when trains are crowded, the line has historically had a high level of fare avoidance. Under Silverlink most stations lacked any ticket purchasing facilities. In theory, passengers could purchase tickets from the conductors on the trains, but it was not always possible to do this. Following the introduction of the current ticketing arrangements, ticketless travel fell from an estimated peak of 40% under Silverlink, to 2% in March 2008.London Overground Review page 5 Passenger volume The number of paying passengers has increased very significantly since the start of London Overground. This is the passenger volume for the years beginning April 2002 to April 2019. Notes: The large increases in the year beginning April 2006 were partly due to travelcards for National Rail journeys being made from stations that have only a London Underground office and also using a different methodology to estimate likely journeys made from National Rail stations in Zone 1. The large increases in the year beginning April 2010 were partly due to Oyster Cards being introduced in January 2010, and new rolling stock. Usage of the Gospel Oak to Barking line on the London Overground reduced as a result of engineering works throughout the year. Work included a full closure between October 2016 and February 2017. =Trains= Class 378 at Harringay Green Lanes station Class 710 standing at Barking Until 2010 London Overground operated six Class 150 two-coach diesel units on the line. They were replaced by eight Class 172/0 two-coach diesel multiple units (DMUs). In 2017, all trains were diesel powered as the line was not fully electrified, with only two short sections having overhead electrification, at South Tottenham, to provide a link from Seven Sisters to Stratford, and from the junction with the Great Eastern Main Line to Barking but excluding the bay platform which this service uses. These sections were used only by occasional electric trains on other routes or by goods trains. Electrification of the line finished in 2018 but no electric trains were running as there were delays with the new Class 710s. As the leases for the Class 172 came to an end in early 2019, London Overground temporarily shortened three of its Class 378s to run on the line to substitute the Class 172s until the long-delayed Class 710s entered service on 23 May 2019. All of the Class 378s were replaced by 710s by August 2019. = Interchange = Sign advertising the interchange at Gospel Oak The line has same-station interchange with the North London Line at Gospel Oak, the Victoria line at Blackhorse Road and the Hammersmith & City line, District line and c2c at Barking. There are out-of-station interchanges at:National Rail Timetable ‚Äì Page 46. Retrieved 25 October 2013 * Harringay Green Lanes to Harringay on the Great Northern Route * South Tottenham to Seven Sisters on the Seven Sisters Branch of the Lea Valley Lines and the London Underground Victoria line. (Signposting in the street does not indicate the pedestrian/cycle route between the two stations through Stonebridge Road). * Walthamstow Queens Road to Walthamstow Central on the Chingford branch of the Lea Valley Lines and the London Underground Victoria line. A footpath between the two stations, considerably shortening the foot journey between them, opened on 11 August 2014. While the footpath was first proposed in 1996, works had been delayed due to protracted legal battles over planning permission. * Wanstead Park to Forest Gate on the Great Eastern Main Line *Woodgrange Park to Manor Park on the Great Eastern Main Line There are official TfL out-of- station-interchanges, whereby the passenger can continue an unbroken journey between * Upper Holloway and Archway on the Northern line; and * Leytonstone High Road and Leytonstone on the Central line . Two other interchanges are walkable: * Harringay Green Lanes and Manor House on the Piccadilly line; and * Crouch Hill and Finsbury Park on the Piccadilly line and Victoria line = Station facilities = Walthamstow Queens Road station entrance Except at the interchange stations, station facilities are very basic. There are small shelters, information points with recorded service information, information screens and CCTV cameras. Typically there are one or two staff members on duty. Where there are no station buildings they operate out of container-sized portable offices. = Step free access = The line has some stations with step free access, allowing wheelchairs/pushchairs etc. easy access from street level to the platforms, at , , , , and Barking.National Rail, Accessibility Maps (London and South East) As the trains do not align exactly with the platform height, wheelchair users will probably require assistance to board or leave them. =Vibrations= Residents in Walthamstow complained that vibrations from goods traffic on the line were causing damage to their houses. Future =Under construction= Extension to Barking Riverside The line is currently being extended southeast by from the present terminus at Barking to serve the Barking Riverside regeneration area, a brownfield site with permission for around 10,800 new homes. Proposed in the mid 2010s following cancellation of the DLR extension to Dagenham Dock, the extension was approved in 2017, with construction beginning in late 2018. Running partially alongside the existing London, Tilbury and Southend Railway line and then a new viaduct to the Barking Riverside station, the extension will cost ¬£260m and is planned to be completed in late 2021. =Proposed =  Renwick Road  As part of the extension to Barking Riverside, a station at Renwick Road on the London, Tilbury & Southend Railway was proposed. Although not being built as part of the extension to Barking Riverside, the station site was safeguarded so that it can be built at a later stage. Potential Thamesmead extension Following the plan to extend the line to Barking Riverside, there were also proposals to extend the line further across the river to Abbey Wood via Thamesmead, to allow for easier Orbital journeys in East London, and provide Thamesmead with a railway connection for the first time. This was outlined in the R25 orbital railway proposal in 2014, and the potential of a future extension was mentioned in the inspectors report of the Transport and Works Order authorising the extension to Barking Riverside. However, in 2019 Transport for London and City Hall proposed an extension of the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) to serve Thamesmead instead of an extension of the Overground, as part of the proposed Thamesmead and Abbey Wood OAPF (Opportunity Area Planning Framework). An DLR extension was chosen due to lower connectivity benefits of an Overground extension, the low frequency (4 trains an hour) of the GOBLIN line, and most significantly - a construction cost twice as much as the DLR, as the gradients required to cross the River Thames would require large scale tunnelling works when compared to the DLR. Despite recommending an extension of the DLR to Thamesmead, the consultation also noted that an extension of the GOBLIN line could provide good orbital transport links in the long term.  Other proposed changes  Local residents and users of the line have proposed adding a station between Leytonstone High Road and Wanstead Park to serve the Cann Hall area. The Leyton and Wanstead branch of the Labour Party has expressed an interest in the proposal. The line's user group and Islington Borough Council have been pressing for the reopening of the station at Junction Road, as its proximity to Tufnell Park Underground station would allow interchange with the Northern line.

It is served by London Underground, London Overground and National Rail main line services. It is located on Station Parade, in the town centre. On the Underground it is a stop on the District line and is also the eastern terminus of the Hammersmith & City line; on the National Rail network it is served by c2c services operating to and from ; and on the Overground it is the eastern terminus of the Gospel Oak to Barking Line. There is also interchange with London Buses and East London Transit routes on the station frontage. The station was opened in 1854 by the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway as one of the first stations on the route. It was rebuilt in 1908 and again in 1959. , significant redevelopment of the station is currently proposed by Barking and Dagenham London Borough Council and the Department for Transport. History The station was opened on 13 April 1854 by the London Tilbury and Southend Railway (LTSR) on their new line to Tilbury, which split from the Eastern Counties Railway (ECR) at Forest Gate. A shorter route from London between Little Ilford and Gas Factory Junction in Bow, and avoiding the ECR, opened in April 1858. A \\"Pitsea direct\\" branch was completed in June 1888 giving more direct access to Southend-on-Sea via Upminster, and avoiding Tilbury. The station was rebuilt in 1889. In 1894 the Tottenham and Hampstead Junction Railway was extended by means of the Tottenham and Forest Gate Railway to join the 1854 line from Forest Gate to Tilbury. District line services initially operated over the tracks of the LTSR from 1902. In 1905 a pair of tracks was electrified as far as East Ham and the service was cut back there. It was extended back to Barking in 1908 and eastwards to Upminster, over a new set of tracks, from 1932. Hammersmith and City line, then known as the Metropolitan line, service began in 1936. The station booking hall was completely rebuilt between 1959‚Äì61 to designs by architect H.H. Powell with Project architect John Ward of British Railways Eastern Region Architect's Department. Nikolaus Pevsner stated it was \\"erected to coincide with electrification of the railway\\" and that \\"it is commensurately modern in outlook and unquestionably one of the best English stations of this date\\". The station was reopened by the Queen in 1961. It is now a Grade II listed building. =Accidents and incidents= *In November 1923, a locomotive crashed through buffers at Barking and overturned, overhanging the road below. Design The station has four sets of stairs from the platforms to the overbridge and the booking hall. Four ramps connected by a subway give step free access between all the platforms. The stairs/ramps access platforms: 1 and 1a, 2, 3 & 4, 5 & 6, and 7 & 8\\\\. There is a lift between the booking hall and platforms 1 and 1a. This station has two bay platforms (no 1 and 3). Platform 1 is the terminal platform for the Gospel Oak to Barking Line, and is only used by London Overground services. It was electrified in 2017 ready for the planned introduction of electric trains in 2018. Platform 3 is used by some LU trains on both lines that serve the station, but mainly the District line. The ticket office is managed by c2c and has seven serving windows. TRIBUTE and FasTIS ticket machines are in use. Tickets are available for National Rail, as well as London Underground. Oyster Cards can also be issued at the ticket office. There are four Scheidt and Bachman ticket machines, which can issue tickets ordered on line (Tickets on Demand or 'TOD'). The S&B; machines sell Oyster products. The four Shere Fastticket machines still on site as at 25 April 2018 have been taken out of service with effect from 1 April 2018, according to a sign posted on them. Seven ticket barriers and a wide ticket gate control access to all platforms. There are sidings to the east which were built to accommodate D stock, C stock and S stock, though from 2017 only S stock is in service on the route. To the west of the station there are two railway overbridges. The westernmost carries the NR tracks to and from platforms 7 and 8 over the four tracks to and from platforms 2‚Äì6 to join the tracks to and from Woodgrange Park and beyond, facilitating c2c services to serve Stratford and Liverpool Street, and, in future, the first part of the London Overground's extension to Barking Riverside Station. The easternmost bridge carries the westbound Underground tracks from platform 6 over the NR tracks to and from platforms 4 and 5 to the southern side of the LU tracks from platform 2. This enables eastbound cross platform changes between LU trains on platform 2 and NR trains on platform 4. To the east of the station a subway reverses the effect of the above bridge. This enables westbound cross platform changes between LU trains on platform 6 and NR trains on platform 5. =Redevelopment= Barking and Dagenham London Borough Council has developed a Barking Station Masterplan for the redevelopment of the station, including the removal of retail units from the station concourse, expansion of ticket barriers, additional Oyster card machines, and new building work to provide replacement retail and to increase natural light within the station. In 2009, the station was identified as one of the ten worst category B interchange stations for mystery shopper assessment of fabric and environment, and it was planned to receive a share of ¬£50m funding for improvements. As part of the 2011 renewal of the Essex Thameside franchise it was proposed that ownership of the station could transfer to Transport for London. Following the 2010 general election the funding for planned works was withdrawn and the 2011 franchise renewal delayed until 2013. The new franchise invitation to tender proposes the transfer of building maintenance from Network Rail to the new operator, and includes an option to complete the redevelopment works. In 2012, the public space outside the station on Station Parade was re-ordered and repaved, using funding from Transport for London. Services London Overground four-coach Class 378, in service until August 2019 Class 710 four- coach electric train replacing the Class 378 units c2c Class 357 On the Underground, it is served by the District and Hammersmith & City (and two early morning Circle line services) lines and forms the eastern terminus for the Hammersmith & City whilst District line services continue eastward to . The station is also served by National Rail (c2c) and London Overground services. *London Underground: Some LU services run to/from \\"the bay road\\" (platform 3). Most Hammersmith and City line trains run directly to/from the sidings to the east where some trains are stabled overnight, and therefore use through platforms 2 and 6. S7 stock trains have seen regular service to Barking since 9 December 2012. *If travelling west by Underground, it is usually best to take the first train from platform 6 and change west of Plaistow as necessary (the last opportunity to change between the District and Hammersmith-and-City lines being Aldgate East.) Not only does this avoid the walk to the bay road at Barking, but it also may allow connecting with a train that starts at Plaistow, where there is a bay road used to terminate eastbound trains short, to recover time or for other operational expediency. * London Overground: Trains to/from Gospel Oak mostly use platform 1, though some trains run to/from platform 7. This is so that drivers can maintain route knowledge.

Travelcards can be purchased for a period of time varying from one day to a year, from Transport for London, National Rail and their agents. Depending on where it is purchased, and the length of validity, a Travelcard is either printed on a paper ticket with a magnetic stripe or encoded onto an Oyster card, Transport for London's contactless electronic smart card. The cost of a Travelcard is determined by the area it covers and, for this purpose, London is divided into a number of fare zones. The Travelcard season ticket for unlimited travel on London Buses and the London Underground was launched on 22 May 1983 by London Transport. One Day Travelcards and validity on other transport modes were added from 1984 onwards. The introduction of the Travelcard caused an increase in patronage and reduced the number of tickets that needed to be purchased by passengers. History Poster advertising the January 1985 launch of the Capitalcard ticket Before the introduction of the Travelcard, tickets for the London Underground were purchased on a 'point-to- point' basis between two stations, either as a single, return or season ticket; and were priced according to distance travelled. Tickets for travel on London Buses and British Rail were purchased separately. The Travelcard was introduced as the third in a series of major fare revisions that had started in 1981. The introduction of the Travelcard was intended to increase patronage on London Underground and London Buses, particularly during less busy times and to speed up the boarding of bus services. On 4 October 1981, following the Greater London Council election, the incoming Labour administration simplified fares in Greater London by introducing four new bus fare zones and two central London Underground zones, named City and West End, where flat fares applied for the first time. This was accompanied by a cut in prices of about a third and was marketed as the Fares Fair campaign. Following successful legal action against it, on 21 March 1982 London Bus fares were doubled and London Underground fares increased by 91%. The two central area zones were retained and the fares to all other stations were restructured to be graduated at three mile intervals; and thus grouping those stations within three miles of the central zones in an 'inner zone'. In 1983, a third revision of fares was undertaken, and a new inter-modal Travelcard season ticket was launched covering five new numbered zones; representing an overall cut in prices of around 25%. The One Day Travelcard was launched in 1984 and on weekdays was only sold for travel after 09.30. In January 1985 the Capitalcard season ticket was launched, offering validity on British Rail services as well as London Underground and London Buses. It was priced around 10-15% higher than the Travelcard. The card was marketed under the brand \\"The London Connection\\", illustrated with an image of an electric plug bringing together the corporate identities of British Rail and London Transport. In June 1986 the One Day Capitalcard was launched. The Capitalcard brand ended in January 1989 when the Travelcard gained validity on British Rail and DLR services. In January 1991 Zone 5 was split to create a new Zone 6. In January 2002 a peak version of the One Day Travelcard was introduced on weekdays, which allows travel between 04:30 and 09:30 and in 2005 a 3-day version of the Travelcard was launched (they were discontinued in 2010). Travelcard season tickets were made available on electronic smart cards, known as Oyster cards, from 2003 and by 2005 Transport for London ceased selling season tickets on paper tickets, although they continue to be available from National Rail stations. Operation A Travelcard entitles the holder to unlimited travel in Greater London on London Buses, Tramlink, London Underground, London Overground, Docklands Light Railway and National Rail services. Travelcards are issued for periods of one or seven days, or for any period from one month to one year. They provide travel within up to 9 numbered concentric zones, with Zone 1 (which includes the central areas of The City and the West End) at the middle and zones 6, 7, 8 and 9 (which includes London Heathrow Airport and outlying suburbs such as Uxbridge and Upminster, as well as places outside London such as Amersham) at the outer edge. On the London Underground, London Overground, DLR and National Rail, the Travelcard is only valid within the zones indicated on the ticket. On London Buses any Travelcard can be used on any route. On Tramlink any Travelcard valid in zones 3, 4, 5, or 6 can be used on any tram route. Travelcards are sold in a limited number of combinations of adjacent zones with different combinations available depending on the length of validity. Travelcards for only one zone are no longer sold, having been withdrawn in 2006. Travelcards valid for travel in Zone 1 (most of central London) are more expensive than those excluding it, although as of 2011 one- day travelcards not including Zone 1 are no longer sold. Travelcards are valid for any journey commencing before 04.30 on the day after it is due to expire. One day Travelcards can be purchased in Anytime and Off-Peak variants. The Anytime Travelcard can be used at any time from 04:30 on the day it becomes valid; and the cheaper Off-Peak Travelcard cannot be used from 04.30 to 09.30 on weekdays. Off-Peak Travelcards are typically 50% cheaper than Anytime Travelcards. Travelcards for seven days or longer are known as season tickets and allow travel at any time of the day. When bought at a London Underground station or other Transport for London agent, one day Travelcards are sold on a paper ticket with a magnetic stripe and Travelcards lasting seven days or more are loaded on to an Oyster Card. A monthly travelcard (valid for between 28 and 31 days depending on month) is sold for 3.84 times the price of a 7-day card, while annual travelcards are sold for the price of 40 7-day tickets. The price of a travelcard valid for between one month and one year will be the sum of the relevant number of months, plus a pro-rata monthly rate for the number of days in the final month. As 40 weekly tickets cost approximately the same as a 10-month-12-day ticket, it is not possible in practice to buy a travelcard for a period between 10M12D and 1 year, as an annual pass is cheaper and will be issued anyway. =Services outside Greater London= One Day Travelcard issued at a National Rail outlet There are various services outside Greater London on which Travelcards can be used. These are six Central line stations in the Epping Forest district of Essex (and two on the boundary) that are included in zones 4, 5 and 6; seven Metropolitan line stations in Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire that are included in local ancillary zones 7, 8 and 9; four London Overground stations in Hertfordshire, included in local ancillary zones 7 and 8; and fourteen National Rail stations of other operators just outside Greater London that are included in zones 6 to 8. Additionally, on some London Buses services that cross the Greater London boundary, Travelcards are valid for the whole route. From outside Greater London, National Rail tickets can be purchased combining a day return ticket with a one-day Travelcard. These include one return journey to and from the edge of the Travelcard area and standard Travelcard validity within the Travelcard Zones. Network rail ticket barriers outside zone 6 will retain the ticket once the return journey has been made even though the travelcard part of the ticket remains valid until 04:30 the following day within the zone 6 boundary.It could conceivably be re-used if the ticket were taken back to London by means of another non-Travelcard ticket or another means of transport. Additionally, National Rail season tickets from outside Greater London can include Travelcard validity within London. =Exceptions= Although located in Zone 6, travel by Heathrow Express to Heathrow Central, Heathrow Terminal 4 and Heathrow Terminal 5 is not included, but since May 2018 travel to Heathrow has been available on the TfL Rail stopping service. Watford Junction is served by London Overground but is not within any of the Travelcard zones, yet a special travelcard including the station and zones 1 - 9 is available. Travel on the High Speed 1 rail link between London St Pancras and Stratford International is also not included unless the travelcard is \\"out-boundary\\": valid to a station outside London. This is because High Speed 1 is considered to be \\"outside the zones\\" except for London St Pancras. =Revenue allocation= The revenues from Travelcard sales are divided according to a scheme agreed by Transport for London and the Rail Delivery Group. A quarterly survey known as the Travelcard Diary Survey is undertaken, where travelcard holders are asked to record all the bus, rail and tube trips they have made using their travelcard. Both \\"in-boundary\\" and \\"out-boundary\\" (i.e. Travelcards in or outside the zonal areas) are surveyed, as well as day and monthly, weekly and annual Travelcards. Ensuring that a statistically valid sample that will give a fair and accurate allocation presents a challenge. The average mileage recorded on each mode is then calculated to give allocation factors of the Travelcard revenue to tube, bus and rail. =Additional benefits= Travelcards entitle the holder to a 33% discount on scheduled London River Services and 25% on the Emirates Air Line in the docklands. In addition, holders of annual travelcards receive a \\"gold record card\\" which offers savings on off-peak travel on the same basis as the National Rail annual gold card.TfL: Gold Cards National Rail: Gold Cards Travelcards issued on paper tickets at National Rail stations are also treated as 'train tickets' for the Days Out Guide 2-for-1 offers at most attractions participating in the scheme.

Krueger was also active in the trade union movement, serving three times as a vice president of the American Federation of Teachers during the decade of the 1930s. He was also active in the Chicago Federation of Labor during 1936 and 1937. During the Socialist Party's faction fight of the 1930s, Krueger was an active member of the so-called \\"Militant\\" faction of young Marxists who sought to turn the SP to the left. In August 1933, he was a delegate at the Socialist International Congress at Paris, where he advocated arming the proletariat.American Socialist Quarterly (July 1934). In 1940, Krueger was the Socialist Party's candidate for Vice President of the United States, running with Norman Thomas. Although Krueger was 34 at the time of the November 1940 election, younger than the constitutional age of 35 for someone seeking to be in line for the U.S. presidency, he was able to point out that by Inauguration Day on January 20, 1941, he would be 35 years and 4 days old. In November 1940, the Thomas-Krueger ticket received 116,599 votes (0.2% of the total). Krueger was on the Executive Committee of the Socialist Party for many years, serving as the SP's National Chairman from 1942 to 1946.

It is the sixth-tallest tower and the 24th-tallest freestanding structure in the world.Andrew Burke, Mark Elliott. Iran (Lonely Planet Country Guide). p. 114. Lonely Planet Publications, 5th Edition, 2008. . It is located between Qarb Town and the district of Gisha, standing at 435 meters from the base to the tip of the antenna. The head consists of a large pod with 12 floors, the roof of which is at 315 meters. The tower is a part of the International Trade and Convention Center of Tehran, which also includes a five-star hotel, a convention center, a world trade center and an IT park. History =Background= The Milad Tower was part of the Shahestan Pahlavi project, a vast development for a new government and commercial centre for Tehran, that was designed in the 1970s but never materialized, except for the Tower. After an international competition, the project was awarded to the Llewely Davies Company, and construction was inaugurated on August 19, 1975, with the Shah of Iran and the Mayor of Tehran Dr G.R. Nickpay burying a commemorative gold plaque .Shahestan Pahlavi. Book 1: The Master Plan. Llewely Davies, 1976 There is also another background of building this tower, since the construction of the tower was started after the 1979 revolution. The new government of Iran wanted to create a new symbol for Tehran to replace the Azadi Tower that was a symbol of Pahlavi's reign. =Construction= The construction of the tower was commenced in 1997. Upon completion of its construction in the mid 2000s, the Milad Tower was considered the fourth- tallest freestanding telecommunication tower in the world. While the tower opened in 2007, numerous conflicts on the history of the tower still prevail, partly because sections of the tower were open to visitors once the elevators started operating during construction and the tower was still far from finished. The design of the project was headed by Iranian architect Mohammad Reza Hafezi. The general contractor was the company of Boland Payeh, and the main client and investor was the company of Yadman Sazeh, a representative of the Municipality of Tehran. The tower was officially opened on October 7, 2008 by the 55th Mayor of Tehran, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, and members of the City Council of Tehran. More than 250 local and foreign journalists were covering the event. Structure and features An outline of the Milad Tower. world's seven tallest towers. Milad Tower is tall and is the tallest tower in Iran, and the sixth-tallest telecommunication tower in the world. It consists of five main parts, including the foundation, transition (lobby) structure, shaft, head structure and the antenna mast. The lobby structure consists of six floors. The first three floors consist of 63 trade units, 11 food courts, a cafeteria, and a commercial products exhibition which is supposed to be about . The first and second underground floors consist of installing sections and a data center. The ground floor is dedicated to the entrance and the gatehouse. Inside one of the elevators of the Milad Tower. The shaft is a concrete structure about high from the ground floor. Six elevators in three different sides of the shaft are used to transfer the visitors to the head of the tower at the speed of , besides an emergency staircase at the fourth side. The head of the tower is a steel structure weighing about 25,000 tonnes and consisting of 12 floors. The top floors of the tower include a public art gallery, a cafeteria, a revolving restaurant, a VIP restaurant, telecommunication floors, mechanical floors, fire-immune areas built as a refuge zone, a closed observation deck, an open observation deck, and a sky dome. The four-stage antenna mast is about high. The lower floor of the mast is for the adjustment of public users' telecommunication antennas, and the three upper floors are dedicated to the antenna of the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting. The complex also features a parking area of about , a large computer and telecommunications unit, a cultural and scientific unit, a commercial transaction center, a temporary showroom for exhibiting products, a specialized library, an exhibition hall, and an administrative unit.

It was essentially a youth ideology (similar to those that had swept France, Ireland, the United States of America and Italy). Its main proponents were Karl Gutzkow, Heinrich Laube, Theodor Mundt and Ludolf Wienbarg; Heinrich Heine, Ludwig B√∂rne and Georg B√ºchner were also considered part of the movement. The wider group included Willibald Alexis, Adolf Glassbrenner, Gustav K√ºhne, Max Waldau and Georg Herwegh.Junges Deutschland The Crystal Reference Encyclopedia (2005) Overview The writers of Young Germany were against what they perceived as of \\"absolutism\\" in politics and \\"obscurantism\\" in religion. They maintained the principles of democracy, socialism, and rationalism. Among the many things they advocated were: separation of church and state, the emancipation of the Jews, and the raising of the political and social position of women. During a time of political unrest in Europe, Young Germany was regarded as dangerous by many politicians due to its progressive viewpoint. During December 1835 the Frankfurt Bundestag banned the publication in Germany of many authors associated with the movement, namely Heine, Gutzkow, Laube, Mundt, and Wienbarg. In their reasoning, they explained that the Young Germans were attempting to ‚Äúattack the Christian religion in the most impudent way, degrade existing conditions and destroy all discipline and morality with belletristic writings accessible to all classes of readers.‚Äù The ideology produced poets, thinkers and journalists, all of whom reacted against the introspection and particularism of Romanticism in the national literature, which had resulted in a total separation of literature from the actualities of life. The Romantic Movement was considered apolitical, lacking the activism that Germany's burgeoning intelligentsia required. As a result of the decades of compulsory school attendance in German states, mass literacy meant an excess of educated males which the establishment could not subsume. Thus in the 1830s, with the advantage of inexpensive printing presses, there was a rush of educated males into the so-called ‚Äúfree professions.‚Äù Notes References * In German: * Jost Hermand (edit.): Das Junge Deutschland.

Welch, is an approach for spectral density estimation. It is used in physics, engineering, and applied mathematics for estimating the power of a signal at different frequencies. The method is based on the concept of using periodogram spectrum estimates, which are the result of converting a signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. Welch's method is an improvement on the standard periodogram spectrum estimating method and on Bartlett's method, in that it reduces noise in the estimated power spectra in exchange for reducing the frequency resolution. Due to the noise caused by imperfect and finite data, the noise reduction from Welch's method is often desired. Definition and Procedure The Welch method is based on Bartlett's method and differs in two ways: # The signal is split up into overlapping segments: the original data segment is split up into L data segments of length M, overlapping by D points. ## If D = M / 2, the overlap is said to be 50% ## If D = 0, the overlap is said to be 0%. This is the same situation as in the Bartlett's method. # The overlapping segments are then windowed: After the data is split up into overlapping segments, the individual L data segments have a window applied to them (in the time domain). ## Most window functions afford more influence to the data at the center of the set than to data at the edges, which represents a loss of information. To mitigate that loss, the individual data sets are commonly overlapped in time (as in the above step). ## The windowing of the segments is what makes the Welch method a \\"modified\\" periodogram. After doing the above, the periodogram is calculated by computing the discrete Fourier transform, and then computing the squared magnitude of the result.

Being worked on sporadically from 1979 to 1986, the film's development and production had difficulties which finally prompted the film being abandoned before completion. The Works would have been the first entirely 3D CGI film had it been finished in the early 1980s as intended. This goal was later accomplished by Pixar's Toy Story, released in 1995, nearly a decade after The Works was attempted. The name was inspired by the original meaning of the word \\"robot\\", derived from \\"robota\\" (\\"work\\"), a word found in many Slavic languages.Out of this World It was originally intended to be approximately 90 minutes long although less than 10 minutes were known to be produced. Short in length and few in number, the completed film sequences were highly impressive considering the state of the technology and what was then the unique look of 3D computer animation. A trailer of the forthcoming film was screened at SIGGRAPH in 1982. The project also resulted in other groundbreaking computer animations such as 3DV, Sunstone, Inside a Quark and some segments of the short film The Magic Egg from 1984.  Plot  The story, written by Lance Williams, was never finalized but centered around \\"Ipso Facto\\", a charming elliptical robot, and the heroine, a young female pilot nicknamed \\"T-Square\\". The story was set at some time in the distant future when a malfunctioning computer, \\"The Works\\", triggered a devastating last World War but then, realizing what it had done, set out to repopulate the planet entirely with robots. T-Square, who worked and lived in a nearby asteroid belt, vowed to journey to Earth and fight to make it safe for the return of her fellow space-faring humanity. Many staff- members contributed designs and modeled characters and sets under the coordination of art director Bil Maher who created blueprint-style designs for T-Square and many of the 25 robots called for by the script. Dick Lundin, legendary for his exhaustive and elaborate creations, designed and animated a huge mining ship and the gigantic robot \\"Ant\\" which was to be one of the villains in control of the Earth.  Pre-production  The founder of NYIT (New York Institute of Technology), entrepreneur and eccentric millionaire Dr. Alexander Schure, had a long and ardent interest in animation. He was a great admirer of Walt Disney and dreamed of making animated features like those from the golden age of theatrical animation. He had already created a traditional animation facility at NYIT. After visiting the University of Utah and seeing the potential of the computer technology in the form of the computer drawing program Sketchpad created by Ivan Sutherland, he told his people to pore over the Utah research center and get him one of everything they had. He then established the NYIT Computer Graphics Lab, buying state-of-the-art equipment and hiring major researchers from throughout the computer graphics field. At first, one of CGL's main goals was to use computers to produce 2D animation and invent tools to assist traditional animators in their work. Schure reasoned that it should be possible to develop computer technology that would make the animation process cheaper and faster. An early version of the CAPS system later used by Disney animators were among the tools they created there. Once its potential became clear, the main focus of the Lab became 3D computer graphics, and when Lance Williams presented his story, \\"The Works\\", the idea was to attempt to make it as a 3D computer animated feature. Schure enthusiastically agreed and green-lit the project as he too dreamt of a computer animated movie and had this in mind when he created the facility. This movie project became the center of attention at NYIT CGL. For many of the individuals involved, it became a primary and personal goal to create the first computer generated feature. While creating a one-of-a-kind film in a method that had never been done before was the motivation, the practical reason for the project was to continue to develop patentable tools while demonstrating what computer animation could accomplish for the entertainment industry. In theory the project's success would lead to significant improvements in visual effects and in the editing process in film and television. Integrating computer power into visual media held promise in terms of speed, cost, creativity, and quality compared to more conventional techniques. The arrival of \\"The Works\\" would have been the beginning of a new animation genre. Interested representatives from movie studios and television networks regularly toured the lab as did musicians Laurie Anderson and Peter Gabriel, puppeteer Jim Henson and animation legends Chuck Jones and Shamus Culhane. Schure was well aware of the challenges and potential for success going into the project and consistently provided very extensive resources to aid the research and development of the necessary technologies. Schure also believed that his staff would work best if they were constantly being supplied with the latest computer hardware. This meant that with each new advance in the field, his staff would have to upgrade their systems, convert existing programs, and rework familiar tools for use on new machines. When these upgrades actually delayed production significantly, Schure kept himself isolated from the complaints of his staff but for his part there were never any budgetary constraints or the pressure of a release date.  Production difficulties  While progress on The Works did manage to advance the level of computer animation technology significantly, the film itself was in development hell for nearly a decade and was eventually abandoned for several reasons. The staff was composed almost entirely of technical experts, such as engineers and programmers, with directors and editors considered unnecessary. When NYIT, with Schure as a director, produced a 2D feature known as Tubby the Tuba, the film did very poorly and shook their confidence in their ability to produce a film that would succeed critically or financially. The lukewarm reception of Disney's heavily computer-themed Tron did little to buoy the group's confidence in their ultimate success. CGL was not working in a field without competition. George Lucas also realized the potential gains from computer animation, and in 1979, he created a new department of Lucasfilm which had the same goals as CGL, but ensured that movie industry professionals had a hand in the production. As Lucasfilm began headhunting for the best talent in the industry, many individuals struggling on \\"The Works\\" felt that Lucasfilm was a company more likely to succeed and abandoned NYIT. The Cornell University was another competitor, and NYIT lost some of its best people to them during the following years.  Losing interest  Another major problem was in the computers themselves. They were among the best and most powerful of their kind but, compared to the computers of today, were too slow and underpowered to generate the number of images required for a theatrical film. Attempting to pick up the pace, Dr. Schure recommitted himself to the project and the NYIT Computer Graphics Lab had more than 60 employees at its peak. Some were dedicated to The Works while others made animations for advertisers as a way to soften the financial toll the prolonged project exacted. Now not only did the computer team have to continue do ground-breaking animation and tool development, but as the quality of their output improved, they attracted outside clients wanting to commission title animations, commercials, and scenes for music videos, jobs which further sapped energy from the production. Scientist Ned Greene looked at the situation, analyzed all the elements needed to the film and crunched the numbers with devastating results: with the technology available, even if all the models and animations were calculated, it would take seven years to output the rendered frames needed to complete the film. The fact was, that in spite of all the resources brought to bear, CGL did not have the human or technical capacity to create film quality sequences on the hardware of the time. Once it had been shown that the film could not be realized, The Works was officially abandoned. A less ambitious project, 3DV, was attempted. In a bid to circumvent the filmmaking bottleneck, 3DV was intended to be a TV special with a script that would include footage originally intended for The Works repurposed as programming for an imaginary all-computer generated cable TV service. 3DV incorporated some of its own innovations like 3D lip-synching and compositing a CG character into a live- action scene but, other than a promotional edit which was shown at SIGGRAPH, this too went nowhere. Many of those who had been working at CGL were hired by others and took their ideas, techniques and experience to new places. The vision of Dr. Schure and the effort invested in The Works were at the forefront of technology which continued to evolve into both an artform and an industry. Though the film was never completed in spite of the millions of dollars invested in it, it was clear that The Works was not a waste of time and money. People involved in the project were and are among the top computer graphics researchers and developers in the world and their early creations are now in common use in 3D modeling and animation programs and in editors like After Effects, Photoshop, and Flash. When the first computer animated feature was finally released in the form of Toy Story, Edwin Catmull, one of the founding fathers of the NYIT (New York Institute of Technology) Computer Graphics Lab and other Lab alumni had become members of Pixar's staff.

Macmillan, New York. or liverwort)Webster's Third International Dictionary is a genus of herbaceous perennials in the buttercup family, native to central and northern Europe, Asia and eastern North America. Some botanists include Hepatica within a wider interpretation of Anemone. Etymology The word hepatica derives from the Greek , from 'liver', because the three-lobed leaf was thought to resemble the human liver.  Description  Bisexual flowers with pink, purple, blue, or white sepals and three green bracts appear singly on hairy stems from late winter to spring. Butterflies, moths, bees, flies and beetles are known pollinators. The leaves are basal, leathery, and usually three-lobed, remaining over winter.  Cultivation  Hepatica cultivation has been popular in Japan since the 18th century (mid-Edo period), where flowers with doubled petals and a range of colour patterns have been developed. Noted for its tolerance of alkaline limestone-derived soils, Hepatica may grow in a wide range of conditions; it can be found either in deeply shaded deciduous (especially beech) woodland and scrub or grassland in full sun. Hepatica will also grow in both sandy and clay-rich substrates, being associated with limestone. Moist soil and winter snowfall are required; Hepatica is tolerant of winter snow cover, but less so of dry frost. Propagation Propagation is done by seeds or by dividing vigorous clumps in spring. However, seedlings take several years to reach bloom size, and divided plants are slow to thicken. Herbalism Hepatica is named from its leaves, which, like the human liver (Greek hepar), have three lobes. It was once used as a medicinal herb. Owing to the doctrine of signatures, the plant was once thought to be an effective treatment for liver disorders. Although poisonous in large doses, the leaves and flowers may be used as an astringent, as a demulcent for slow-healing injuries, and as a diuretic.

Originally designed and implemented at Hewlett-Packard labs in Palo Alto, California, TimesTen spun out into a separate startup in 1996 and was acquired by Oracle Corporation in 2005. All data within a TimesTen database is located in physical memory (RAM), which means that no data operation requires disk I/O. This is unlike traditional disk-optimized relational databases such as the Oracle Database, DB2, Informix or SQL Server, whose designs must contain algorithms that attempt to minimize disk accesses. TimesTen provides applications with short, consistent response- times and very high throughput as required by applications with database- intensive workloads. As memory operates far faster than hard disk, TimesTen is used in applications where service-level agreements require low and predictable response times, such as telecommunications, real-time financial- services trading applications, network equipment, and large web applications. Also, unlike other memory-caching systems that use key-value pairs (such as Memcached, Hazelcast or Coherence), TimesTen can be accessed with standard interfaces and provides the functionality of the SQL query language. Applications with data residing in an Oracle Database can utilize TimesTen through a database caching option (as distinct from Oracle Database In-Memory ), in which TimesTen functions as an in-memory cache database in front of an Oracle Database. TimesTen runs on most major Unix/Linux platforms and on various Windows platforms, in both 32-bit and 64-bit modes. Technology TimesTen is an in-memory database management technology that provides very fast data access time. It assumes all data will reside in physical memory (RAM) during run time. The result is very low response times, which enable high throughput, even on commodity hardware. = Architecture = Shared libraries TimesTen functionality is contained in a set of shared libraries that application developers link to their application, allowing TimesTen to execute as part of the application's process. This shared library approach is different than conventional RDBMS systems where the database is essentially a set of distinct processes to which applications connect via some form of inter-process communication. This communication may take the form of a client/server connection spanning over a network or it may be some form of intra-system IPC such as a Unix domain socket connection or a shared memory based connection mechanism. Memory-resident database The data for each active TimesTen database is stored in a shared memory segment, allowing multiple TimesTen databases to be active concurrently, and also allowing an application to simultaneously access several TimesTen databases on the same system. On 64-bit platforms, the size of a TimesTen database is practically limited only by the amount of RAM available on its host computer. One customer has a production TimesTen database approaching two terabytes in size utilized for on-line transaction processing. Database processes Starting TimesTen requires starting a background process called the TimesTen main daemon, which then starts multiple TimesTen subdaemon processes to manage each database created in the system. These subdaemon processes perform database operations such as: # loading and unloading the database into RAM # writing periodic fuzzy checkpoints of the TimesTen database to disk # writing transaction log records from the in-memory log buffer to the transaction log files on disk # handling deadlocks Connection modes Client applications that connect to traditional disk-based relational databases typically use TCP/IP or another IPC mechanism to communicate with a database server process. In TimesTen, applications that reside in the same server as the TimesTen database can connect directly to the in-memory image of the database by using the TimesTen direct driver, eliminating the need for any inter-process communication of any kind, thus providing extremely fast performance. If the application resides on a remote server, the application can also connect to the TimesTen database using the traditional client/server model of data access. = Availability and integrity = Checkpoint and transaction log files All TimesTen data exists in RAM, however TimesTen does utilize non-volatile storage (such as a hard disk) for database persistence and recoverability. A TimesTen database stores all transactional data modifications in an in-memory log buffer, which is eventually persisted to disk in the form of transaction log files. In addition, TimesTen also persists snapshots of the in-memory database, called checkpoint files, to disk. The combination of checkpoint files and transaction log files allow TimesTen to provide recoverability in the event of a system failure. TimesTen implements a parallel log manager in order to maximize throughput on large SMP systems. By default, TimesTen operates in non-durable commit mode. In this mode, a commit operation occurs purely in memory, and the writing of the log records for the transaction to disk occurs asynchronously to the commit. This provides for very low response times and very high throughput at the cost of the potential for some small amount of data loss in the event of a system failure. A true synchronous commit mode (durable commit mode) is also provided; this mode avoids the possibility of any data loss at the cost of reduced performance. When operating in synchronous commit mode, TimesTen provides automatic group commit optimization. TimesTen allows the architect / developer to balance performance versus data safety by providing control of the commit mode at three different levels: database, connection, and transaction. Another option for data protection and high-availability is to use TimesTen replication. Replication The TimesTen replication mechanism enables a highly available system by sending database updates between two or more hosts. With TimesTen replication, a master host sends updates to one or more subscriber hosts. TimesTen recommends an active-standby pair configuration for highest availability. An active-standby pair consists of two master databases, an active and a standby database. In addition to the active and standby databases, multiple subscriber databases can be configured to serve as disaster recovery copies or read-only farms. Replication in TimesTen is implemented by the replication agent, a daemon process that aims at every TimesTen database involved in replication. The replication agent sends and receives updates between databases by communicating with the replication agents of other databases involved in the same replication scheme. Change capture is via log-mining with in-memory optimization; under normal operating conditions change records are captured from the in-memory log buffer with no need for any disk I/O. Communication between replication agents is via an efficient stream-oriented protocol built on top of regular TCP/IP connections. The replication agent is multi-threaded and in the 11.2.2 release, TimesTen supports parallel replication for increased throughput. The replication workload is automatically parallelized to maximize throughput while still maintaining correctness. =In-memory database cache= TimesTen provides the capability to cache data from an Oracle Database source. When used in this fashion, TimesTen is referred to as Oracle In-Memory Database Cache (IMDB Cache), an Oracle Database product option. To utilize Oracle Database caching, one defines one or more SQL objects known as cache groups. A cache group is a set of one or more related database tables and allows for subsets of its rows and/or columns. Database tables in a cache group must each have a defined primary key or a unique index declared across a set of non- nullable columns and must be related in a parent-child hierarchy via primary key-foreign key constraints. SQL predicates can be used to control what data is to be cached. Once a cache group is defined, the cache group can then be \\"loaded\\", allowing Oracle Database data to be cached in TimesTen. Applications can then read from and write to cache groups, and all data modifications will then be synchronized with the corresponding Oracle database tables either automatically or manually. =Event notification= TimesTen provides an event notification mechanism through the transaction log API (XLA). XLA provides functions which allow applications to be notified of data changes occurring in TimesTen tables (and also DDL occurring in the TimesTen database). XLA can also be used in conjunction with materialized views to simplify the process of monitoring changes made to rows spanning multiple tables. XLA works by mining the TimesTen transaction log stream in a similar manner to the replication agent. Database application deployments that do not include an Oracle database which want to use TimesTen as an in-memory cache database can use XLA to capture updates and, via custom application code, apply these updates to their backend database. History TimesTen was founded in HP labs by Marie-Anne Neimat, Sherry Listgarten, and Kurt Shoens, under the name of \\"Smallbase\\". At HP, Jean-Ren√© Bouvier decided to embed Smallbase into HP OpenCall, which made the first commercial use of the product in 1995. In 1996, the product was spun off into a separate venture capital funded startup company based in Mountain View, California under the leadership of CEO Jim Groff. The product became popular for telecommunications equipment, as response times in the milliseconds or even microseconds were required for applications like packet switching. The company had 90 employees and was profitable when it was acquired by Oracle Corporation in 2005. After the acquisition, Neimat remained as the director of TimesTen development at Oracle, adding many Oracle database features to the product such as support for PL/SQL and integration with Oracle SQL Developer and Oracle Enterprise Manager.

Sometimes referred to as the \\"third critique,\\" the Critique of Judgment follows the Critique of Pure Reason (1781) and the Critique of Practical Reason (1788).  Context  Immanuel Kant's Critique of Judgment is the third critique in Kant's Critical project begun in the Critique of Pure Reason and the Critique of Practical Reason (the First and Second Critiques, respectively). The book is divided into two main sections: the Critique of Aesthetic Judgment and the Critique of Teleological Judgment, and also includes a large overview of the entirety of Kant's Critical system, arranged in its final form. The so-called First Introduction was not published during Kant's lifetime, for Kant wrote a replacement for publication. The Critical project, that of exploring the limits and conditions of knowledge, had already produced the Critique of Pure Reason, in which Kant argued for a Transcendental Aesthetic, an approach to the problems of perception in which space and time are argued not to be objects. The First Critique argues that space and time provide ways in which the observing subject's mind organizes and structures the sensory world. The end result of this inquiry in the First Critique is that there are certain fundamental antinomies in human Reason, most particularly that there is a complete inability to favor on the one hand the argument that all behavior and thought is determined by external causes, and on the other that there is an actual \\"spontaneous\\" causal principle at work in human behavior. The first position, of causal determinism, is adopted, in Kant's view, by empirical scientists of all sorts; moreover, it led to the Idea (perhaps never fully to be realized) of a final science in which all empirical knowledge could be synthesized into a full and complete causal explanation of all events possible to the world. The second position, of spontaneous causality, is implicitly adopted by all people as they engage in moral behavior; this position is explored more fully in the Critique of Practical Reason. The Critique of Judgment constitutes a discussion of the place of Judgment itself, which must overlap both the Understanding (\\"Verstand\\") (whichsoever operates from within a deterministic framework) and Reason (\\"Vernunft\\") (which operates on the grounds of freedom). Introduction to the Critique of Judgement The first part of Kant's Critique of Aesthetic Judgement presents what Kant calls the four moments of the \\"Judgement of Taste\\". These are given by Kant in sequence as the (1) First Moment. Of the Judgement of Taste: Moment of Quality\\"; (2) Second Moment. Of the Judgement of Taste: Moment of Quantity\\"; (3) Third Moment: Of Judgement of Taste: Moment of the Relation of the ends brought under Review in such Judgements\\"; and (4) Fourth Moment: Of the Judgement of Taste: Moment of the Modality of the Delight in the Object\\". After the presentation of the four moments of the Judgement of Taste, Kant then begins his discussion of Book 2 of the Third Critique titled Analytic of the Sublime. Aesthetic Judgement The first part of the book discusses the four possible aesthetic reflective judgments: the agreeable, the beautiful, the sublime, and the good. Kant makes it clear that these are the only four possible reflective judgments, as he relates them to the Table of Judgments from the Critique of Pure Reason. \\"Reflective judgments\\" differ from determinative judgments (those of the first two critiques). In reflective judgment we seek to find unknown universals for given particulars; whereas in determinative judgment, we just subsume given particulars under universals that are already known, as Kant puts it: The agreeable is a purely sensory judgment ‚Äî judgments in the form of \\"This steak is good,\\" or \\"This chair is soft.\\" These are purely subjective judgments, based on inclination alone. The good is essentially a judgment that something is ethical ‚Äî the judgment that something conforms with moral law, which, in the Kantian sense, is essentially a claim of modality ‚Äî a coherence with a fixed and absolute notion of reason. It is in many ways the absolute opposite of the agreeable, in that it is a purely objective judgment ‚Äî things are either moral or they are not, according to Kant. The remaining two judgments ‚Äî the beautiful and the sublime ‚Äî differ from both the agreeable and the good. They are what Kant refers to as \\"subjective universal\\" judgments. This apparently oxymoronic term means that, in practice, the judgments are subjective, and are not tied to any absolute and determinate concept. However, the judgment that something is beautiful or sublime is made with the belief that other people ought to agree with this judgment ‚Äî even though it is known that many will not. The force of this \\"ought\\" comes from a reference to a sensus communis ‚Äî a community of taste. Hannah Arendt, in her Lectures on Kant's Political Philosophy, suggests the possibility that this sensus communis might be the basis of a political theory that is markedly different from the one that Kant lays out in the Metaphysic of Morals. The central concept of Kant's analysis of the judgment of beauty is what he called the ‚Ä≥free play‚Ä≥ between the cognitive powers of imagination and understanding. We call an object beautiful, because its form fits our cognitive powers and enables such a ‚Ä≥free play‚Ä≥ (¬ß22) the experience of which is pleasurable to us. The judgment that something is beautiful is a claim that it possesses the \\"form of finality\\" ‚Äî that is, that it appears to have been designed with a purpose, even though it does not have any apparent practical function. We also do not need to have a determinate concept for an object in order to find it beautiful (¬ß9). In this regard, Kant further distinguishes between free and adherent beauty. Whereas judgments of free beauty are made without having one determinate concept for the object being judged (e.g. an ornament or well- formed line), a judgment of beauty is adherent if we do have such a determined concept in mind (e.g. a well-built horse that is recognized as such). The main difference between these two judgments is that purpose or use of the object plays no role in the case of free beauty. In contrast, adherent judgments of beauty are only possible if the object is not ill-suited for its purpose. The judgment that something is sublime is a judgment that it is beyond the limits of comprehension ‚Äî that it is an object of fear. However, Kant makes clear that the object must not actually be threatening ‚Äî it merely must be recognized as deserving of fear. Kant's view of the beautiful and the sublime is frequently read as an attempt to resolve one of the problems left following his depiction of moral law in the Critique of Practical Reason ‚Äî namely that it is impossible to prove that we have free will, and thus impossible to prove that we are bound under moral law. The beautiful and the sublime both seem to refer to some external noumenal order ‚Äî and thus to the possibility of a noumenal self that possesses free will. In this section of the critique Kant also establishes a faculty of mind that is in many ways the inverse of judgment ‚Äî the faculty of genius. Whereas judgment allows one to determine whether something is beautiful or sublime, genius allows one to produce what is beautiful or sublime. Teleology The second half of the Critique discusses teleological judgement. This way of judging things according to their ends (telos: Greek for end) is logically connected to the first discussion at least regarding beauty but suggests a kind of (self-) purposiveness (that is, meaningfulness known by one's self). Kant writes about the biological as teleological, claiming that there are things, such as living beings, whose parts exist for the sake of their whole and their whole for the sake of their parts. This allows him to open a gap in the physical world: since these \\"organic\\" things cannot be brought under the rules that apply to all other appearances, what are we to do with them? Kant says explicitly that while efficiently causal explanations are always best (x causes y, y is the effect of x), \\"it is absurd to hope that another Newton will arise in the future who will make comprehensible to us the production of a blade of grass according to natural laws\\", and so the organic must be explained ‚Äúas if‚Äù it were constituted as teleological. This portion of the Critique is, from some modern theories, where Kant is most radical; he posits man as the ultimate end, that is, that all other forms of nature exist for the purpose of their relation to man, directly or not, and that man is left outside of this due to his faculty of reason. Kant claims that culture becomes the expression of this, that it is the highest teleological end, as it is the only expression of human freedom outside of the laws of nature. Man also garners the place as the highest teleological end due to his capacity for morality, or practical reason, which falls in line with the ethical system that Kant proposes in the Critique of Practical Reason and the Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysics of Morals. Kant attempted to legitimize purposive categories in the life sciences, without a theological commitment. He recognized the concept of purpose has epistemological value for finality, while denying its implications about creative intentions at life and the universe's source. Kant described natural purposes as organized beings, meaning that the principle of knowledge presupposes living creatures as purposive entities. He called this supposition the finality concept as a regulative use, which satisfies living beings specificity of knowledge.Use as a regulative principle contrasts to that of a constructive principle. This heuristic framework claims there is a teleology principle at purpose's source and it is the mechanical devices of the individual original organism, including its heredity. Such entities appear to be self-organizing in patterns. Kant's ideas allowed Johann Friedrich Blumenbach and his followers to formulate the science of types (morphology) and to justify its autonomy. Kant held that there was no purpose represented in the aesthetic judgement of an object's beauty. A pure aesthetic judgement excludes the object's purpose.\\"Beauty is the form of the purposefulness of an object, so far as this is perceived without any representation of a purpose.\\" Influences Though Kant consistently maintains that the human mind is not an \\"intuitive understanding\\"‚Äîsomething that creates the phenomena which it cognizes‚Äîseveral of his readers (starting with Fichte, culminating in Schelling) believed that it must be (and often give Kant credit). Kant's discussions of schema and symbol late in the first half of the Critique of Judgement also raise questions about the way the mind represents its objects to itself, and so are foundational for an understanding of the development of much late 20th century continental philosophy: Jacques Derrida is known to have studied the book extensively. In Truth and Method (1960), Hans-Georg Gadamer rejects Kantian aesthetics as ahistorical in his development of a historically-grounded hermeneutics. Schopenhauer‚Äôs comments Schopenhauer noted that Kant was concerned with the analysis of abstract concepts, rather than with perceived objects. \\"‚Ä¶he does not start from the beautiful itself, from the direct, beautiful object of perception, but from the judgement [someone‚Äôs statement] concerning the beautiful‚Ä¶.\\"The World as Will and Representation, Vol. I, Appendix, p. 531 Kant was strongly interested, in all of his critiques, with the relation between mental operations and external objects. \\"His attention is specially aroused by the circumstance that such a judgement is obviously the expression of something occurring in the subject, but is nevertheless as universally valid as if it concerned a quality of the object. It is this that struck him, not the beautiful itself.\\" The book's form is the result of concluding that beauty can be explained by examining the concept of suitableness. Schopenhauer stated that ‚ÄúThus we have the queer combination of the knowledge of the beautiful with that of the suitableness of natural bodies into one faculty of knowledge called power of judgement, and the treatment of the two heterogeneous subjects in one book.‚Äù Kant is inconsistent, according to Schopenhauer, because ‚Äú‚Ä¶after it had been incessantly repeated in the Critique of Pure Reason that the understanding is the ability to judge, and after the forms of its judgements are made the foundation-stone of all philosophy, a quite peculiar power of judgement now appears which is entirely different from that ability.‚ÄùThe World as Will and Representation, Vol. I, Appendix, p 531 f. With regard to teleological judgement, Schopenhauer claimed that Kant tried to say only this: \\"‚Ä¶although organized bodies necessarily seem to us as though they were constructed according to a conception of purpose which preceded them, this still does not justify us in assuming it to be objectively the case.\\"The World as Will and Representation, Vol. I, Appendix, p. 532 This is in accordance with Kant's usual concern with the correspondence between subjectivity (the way that we think) and objectivity (the external world). Our minds want to think that natural bodies were made by a purposeful intelligence, like ours.

United States Army personnel examined the aircraft. Ju 88H and Fw 190 combined to form a model 3B Mistel Mistel (German for \\"mistletoe\\") was the larger, unmanned component of a composite aircraft configuration developed in Germany during the later stages of World War II. The composite comprised a small piloted control aircraft mounted above a large explosives-carrying drone, the Mistel, and as a whole was referred to as the Huckepack (\\"Piggyback\\"), also known as the Beethoven-Ger√§t (\\"Beethoven Device\\") or Vati und Sohn (\\"Daddy and Son\\"). The most successful of these used a modified Junkers Ju 88 bomber as the Mistel, with the entire nose-located crew compartment replaced by a specially designed nose filled with a large load of explosives, formed into a shaped charge. The upper component was a fighter aircraft, joined to the Mistel by struts. The combination would be flown to its target by a pilot in the fighter; then the unmanned bomber was released to hit its target and explode, leaving the fighter free to return to base. The first such composite aircraft flew in July 1943 and was promising enough to begin a programme by Luftwaffe test unit KG 200, code-named \\"Beethoven\\", eventually entering operational service. Other Mistel composites included the Ta 154/Fw 190, Ar 234/Fi 103, Do 217K/DFS 228 and Si 204/Lippisch DM-1. Projects included the Ju 287/Me 262 and Ar 234C/Arado E.377. Design and development Initial experiments in Nazi Germany concerning composite aircraft of any type were performed with the DFS 230 troop glider as the \\"lower\\" component and using established, piston engine-powered Luftwaffe aircraft, such as the Focke-Wulf Fw 56 or the Messerschmitt Bf 109E, as the upper component in an attempt to provide the troop glider with a longer range than if it were simply towed in the conventional manner. Later, the technique became more refined, and the bomber component (which was often a new aircraft rather than surplus) was fitted with a specialised 1,800 kg (3,960 lb.) warhead. The final stage of Mistel development was of specialised purpose- built jet-powered bomber components, including ones developed from the Messerschmitt Me 262, the Junkers Ju 287 and the entirely new Arado Ar 234. None of these ambitious schemes, with the exception of the Me 262 mistel, had left the drawing board before the end of the war. =Warhead and operational history= Model of the proposed Mistel Heinkel He 162 with an Arado E.377a glide bomb at the Technikmuseum Speyer The definitive Mistel warhead was a shaped charge weighing nearly two tonnes fitted with a copper or aluminium liner with the weight of a blockbuster bomb. The use of a shaped charge was expected to allow penetration of up to seven meters of reinforced concrete. Some 250 Mistels of various combinations were built during the war, but they met with limited success. They were first flown in combat against the Allied invasion fleet during the Battle of Normandy, targeting the British-held harbour at Courseulles-sur-Mer. While Mistel pilots claimed hits, none of these match Allied records; they may have been made against the hulk of the old French battleship Courbet, which had been included as a component of the Mulberry harbour at Arromanches and specially dressed up as a decoy by the Allies. Serious blast and shrapnel damage from a near-miss was suffered by HMS Nith, a River-class frigate being used as a floating headquarters, on 24 June. Nine men were killed and 26 wounded, and Nith was towed back to England for repairs. A second opportunity to use the Mistels, in Scapa Flow in 1944, was abandoned after the sinking of the German battleship Tirpitz led to the departure of all of the Royal Navy's major surface units from the target. As part of Operation Iron Hammer in late 1943 and early 1944, Mistels were selected to carry out key raids against Soviet weapons-manufacturing facilities‚Äîspecifically, electricity-generating power stations around Moscow and Gorky. These plants were known to be poorly defended by the Soviets and irreplaceable. However, before the plan could be implemented, the Red Army had entered Germany, and it was decided to use the Mistels against their bridgehead at K√ºstrin instead. On 12 April 1945, Mistels attacked the bridges being built there, but the damage caused was negligible and delayed the Soviet forces for only a day or two. Subsequent Mistel attacks on other bridges being thrown across the Oder were similarly ineffective.

Its construction was completed on 1 March 1995. It features an antenna that increases its height to 421 metres (1,381 feet) and is the 7th tallest freestanding tower in the world. The roof of the pod is at 335 metres (1,099 feet). The rest of the tower below has a stairwell and an elevator to reach the upper area, which also contains a revolving restaurant, providing diners with a panoramic view of the city. Races are held annually, where participants race up the stairs to the top. The tower also acts as the Islamic falak observatory to observe the crescent moon which marks the beginning of Muslim month of Ramadhan, Syawal, and Zulhijjah, to celebrate fasting month of Ramadhan, Hari Raya Aidilfitri and Aidiladha. The tower is the highest viewpoint in Kuala Lumpur that is open to the public.  History  The official groundbreaking for the Kuala Lumpur Tower was overseen by the 4th Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tun Dr Mahathir bin Mohamad on 1 October 1991. Construction of the tower was a three-phase process. The first phase was the widening of Jalan Bukit Nanas and the excavation of soil from the construction site. This phase was completed on 1 August 1992. On 1 July 1992, the second phase began with the construction of the foundation and basement of the tower. Approximately 50,000 cubic metres of concrete were continuously poured for 31 hours, thus setting a record in the Malaysian construction industry. The foundation work, requiring no piling, was completed on 1 April 1993. The third phase was the construction of the 'superstructure' which began in May 1994. The construction of the tower started with the erection of the tower shaft, then the tower head. As the finishing touches to the tower head were applied, the construction of the touristic building began. The main lobby of the upper ground floor is decorated with exquisite glass-clad domes that sparkle like giant diamonds. These domes were designed and arranged in the form of the Muqarnas by Iranian craftsmen from Isfahan. On 13 September 1994, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad performed the 'topping-up ceremony' where the antenna mast was installed, thus marking the final height of the tower, 421 metres above the ground. After installation of facilities and amenities, Menara Kuala Lumpur was opened to public on 23 July 1996. Menara Kuala Lumpur was officially inaugurated by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on 1 October 1996 at 20:30 MST. Among the distinguished guests were the Yang di-Pertuan Agong Tuanku Jaafar ibni Almarhum Tuanku Abdul Rahman, Raja Permaisuri Agong Tuanku Najihah, the wives of the Sultan of Brunei, Sultana Hajah Saleha and Princess Hajah Mariam Binti Abdul Aziz.Kuala Lumpur Tower was opened, 1 October 1996 New Straits Times  Broadcasting  Kuala Lumpur Tower, a member of the World Federation of Great Towers, is utilised by several organisations for various broadcasting purposes. Originally intended only for television broadcasting, radio antennas were included during the construction. The tower now broadcasts free-to-air terrestrial television stations that use the tower's antenna include: { style=\\"width:75%;\\"  Television: * Media Prima Berhad ** NTV7 (UHF Channel 35) } Media telecommunications and broadcasting mast. Television stations which are transmitted from the tower includes private (commercial) station, NTV7 a subsidiary of Media Prima Berhad broadcasting through UHF obtained from an antenna by 200 metres. Malaysia currently employs both analogue broadcasting and all television broadcasting is to be analogue. Kuala Lumpur Tower is not a reliable broadcasting antenna for completely digital broadcasting because the tower is not tall enough to transmit the higher frequency waves needed to areas surrounded by forests or high-rise buildings. As an alternative, a new 421-metre-tall (1,381-foot). To make Kuala Lumpur Tower more appealing to one free-to-air terrestrial commercial broadcasting on Media Prima Berhad who plan to move their transmitting stations to the new tower have drafted a plan to extend its digital broadcasting antenna by 401 to 421 metres. To increase the height of the tower's antenna by 421 metres, the structure itself will have to be lengthened by 200 metres, which would cost approximately RM4 billion. In addition to covering this cost, the company would put RM3.5 billion into refurbishing the transmitting station, offering four times more area to each broadcaster. Current Kuala Lumpur aviation restrictions limit Kuala Lumpur Tower's height, but has stated that the company plans to discuss the matter with related ministries and agencies. If these plans are not realised, however, Kuala Lumpur Tower is expected to stop transmitting television waves with the exception of Media Prima Berhad, who will continue to broadcast through the tower. also pointed out the possibility of the tower depending on what the television broadcasters want or need. Channels listed by frequency =Television= * UHF 35 ‚Äì NTV7 All services television broadcast at 20 kW relay of Kuala Lumpur Tower based in Klang Valley (surrounding based in Kuala Lumpur)  Facts  The KL Tower is the seventh tallest telecommunication tower in the world (after Tokyo Skytree in Japan, the Canton Tower in China, CN Tower in Canada, the Ostankino Tower in Russia, the Oriental Pearl Tower in China, and the Milad Tower in Iran). Built to enhance the quality of telecommunication services and the clarity of broadcasting, KL Tower is a symbol of Kuala Lumpur. The structure is divided into five basic sections: # The foundation base houses three basement floors for safety purposes, storage and maintenance work. # The touristic building bears the administration office, souvenir shops and the 146-metre-long pedestrian mall with cascading pools. # The tower shaft comprises 22 levels with four elevators and flights of stairs with a total of 2,058 steps. # The tower head holds the public observation platform (276 m) and revolving restaurant, as well as the telecommunication and broadcasting stations. # The antenna mast crowns the tower and is utilised for telecommunication and broadcasting transmissions. When constructing the KL Tower, the builders took special care to construct a retaining wall around a 100-year-old jelutong tree (Dyera costulata). The tower was moved at a cost of RM430,000 to avoid harming the monumental tree, which is found near the pedestrian mall. KL Tower is managed by Menara Kuala Lumpur Sdn. Bhd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Telekom Malaysia Group. KL Tower was the first Pit Stop in The Amazing Race Asia 1 and fielded a route marker on the final leg of the same season. Transport The Tower is located on Jalan Puncak, which branches off from Jalan P. Ramlee. Even though they're not very close, the closest rapid transit stations would be Bukit Nanas Monorail station and Dang Wangi LRT station. Tourism Tourists visit KL Tower to have a 360-degree view of the city. The lift takes only 54 seconds going up to the observation deck and takes 52 seconds to come down.

On December 1, 1969, the Selective Service System of the United States conducted two lotteries to determine the order of call to military service in the Vietnam War for men born from January 1, 1944 to December 31, 1950. These lotteries occurred during a period of conscription in the United States that lasted from 1947 to 1973. It was the first time a lottery system had been used to select men for military service since 1942. Origins The lottery of 1969 was conceived to address perceived inequities in the draft system as it existed previously, and to add more military personnel towards the Vietnam War. The war had arisen from a series of conflicts dating back to the early stages of French colonialism and Japanese occupation of Vietnam in World War II. In 1963, South Vietnamese generals seized power in Saigon in a coup. President Lyndon B. Johnson increased the number of U.S. personnel in South Vietnam due to the political instability in the country. More active US involvement in the war began in August 1964, when two U.S. warships were alleged to have been attacked by North Vietnamese torpedo boats. Johnson condemned North Vietnam, and Congress passed a motion which gave him more authority over military decisions. By the end of 1965, President Johnson had sent 82,000 troops to Vietnam, and his military advisors wanted another 175,000. Due to the heavy demand for military personnel, the United States increased the number of men the draft provided each month. In the 1960s anti-war movements started to occur in the U.S., mainly among students on college campuses and in more leftist circles, especially those who embraced the \\"hippie\\" lifestyle. College students were entitled to a deferment (2-S status) but were subject to the draft if they dropped out, stopped making \\"normal progress\\" in community college (i.e., started a fifth semester before transferring to a four-year college) or graduated.https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/02/us/college- enrollment-linked-to-vietnam-war.html, https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1967/03/19/107186611.pdf In 1967, the number of U.S. military personnel in Vietnam was around 500,000. The war was costing the U.S. $25 billion a year, and many of the young men drafted were being sent to a war they wanted no part of. Martin Luther King Jr. also started to support the anti-war movement, believing the war to be immoral and expressing alarm at the number of African-American soldiers that were being killed. November 15, 1969 marked the largest anti-war protest in the history of the United States. It featured many anti-war political speakers and popular singers of the time. Many critics at the time saw Richard Nixon as a liar; when he took office, he claimed that he would begin to withdraw American troops from Vietnam. After ten months of being in office, the president had yet to start withdrawals, and U.S. citizens felt he had lied. Later, President Nixon claimed to have been watching sports as the anti-war demonstration took place outside the White House. After much debate within the Nixon administration and Congress, Congress decided that a gradual transition to an all-volunteer force was affordable, feasible, and would enhance the nation's security. On November 26, 1969, Congress abolished a provision in the Military Selective Service Act of 1967 which prevented the president from modifying the selection procedure (\\"...the President in establishing the order of induction for registrants within the various age groups found qualified for induction shall not effect any change in the method of determining the relative order of induction for such registrants within such age groups as has been heretofore established...\\"), () and President Richard Nixon issued an executive order prescribing a process of random selection. Method The 366 days of the year (including February 29) were printed on slips of paper. These pieces of paper were then each placed in opaque plastic capsules, which were then mixed in a shoebox and then dumped into a deep glass jar. Capsules were drawn from the jar one at a time and opened. The first number drawn was 158 (September 14), so all registrants with that birthday were assigned lottery number 1. The second number drawn corresponded to April 24, and so forth. All men of draft age (born January 1, 1944 to December 31, 1950) who shared a birth date would be called to serve at once. The first 195 birthdates drawn were later called to serve in the order they were drawn; the last of these was September 24. See also sorted by numeric order. Also on December 1, 1969, a second lottery, identical in process to the first, was held with the 26 letters of the alphabet. The first letter drawn was \\"J\\", which was assigned number 1. The second letter was \\"G\\", and so on, until all 26 letters were assigned numbers. Among men with the same birthdate, the order of induction was determined by the ranks of the first letters of their last, first, and middle names.Norton Starr (1997). \\"Nonrandom Risk: The 1970 Draft Lottery\\". Journal of Statistics Education 5.2 (1997). ‚Äî The online edition includes instructions for getting the data online and a lesson plan for statistics class using the 1970 and 1971 draft lottery data. Anyone with initials \\"JJJ\\" would have been first within the shared birthdate, followed by \\"JGJ\\", \\"JDJ\\", and \\"JXJ\\"; anyone with initials \\"VVV\\" would have been last. SSS Draft scatterplot of the days of the year (horizontal) and their lottery numbers (vertical). December birthdays (far right) were assigned many low numbers (bottom), representing early induction, and few high numbers (top). A random procedure will not distribute the lottery numbers uniformly over the months of the year, but this was what some people expected. It happened that November and December births, or numbers 306 to 366, were assigned mainly to lower draft order numbers representing earlier calls to serve. This led to complaints that the lottery was not truly random as the legislation required. Only five days in December‚ÄîDecember 2, 12, 15, 17, and 19‚Äîwere higher than the last call number of 195. Had the days been evenly distributed, 14 days in December would have been expected to remain uncalled. From January to December, the rank of the average draft pick numbers were 5, 4, 1, 3, 2, 6, 8, 9, 10, 7, 11, and 12. A Monte Carlo simulation found that the probability of a random order of months being this close to the 1‚Äì12 sequence expected for unsorted slips was 0.09%. An analysis of the procedure suggested that \\"The capsules were put in a box month by month, January through December, and subsequent mixing efforts were insufficient to overcome this sequencing\\".  Aftermath and modification  The draft lottery had social and economic consequences because it generated further resistance to military service. Those who resisted were generally young, well-educated, healthy men. The fear of service in Vietnam influenced many young men to join the National Guard. They were aware that the National Guard would be unlikely to send its soldiers to Vietnam. Many men were unable to join the National Guard even though they had passed their physicals, because many state National Guards had long waiting lists to enlist. Still others chose legal sanctions such as imprisonment, showing their disapproval by illegally burning their draft cards or draft letters, or simply not presenting themselves for military service. Others left the country, commonly moving to Canada. The 1960s were a time of turmoil in the United States, beginning with the civil rights movement which set the standards for practices by the anti-war movement. The 1969 draft lottery only encouraged resentment of the Vietnam War and the draft. It strengthened the anti-war movement, and all over the United States, people decried discrimination by the draft system \\"against low-education, low-income, underprivileged members of society\\". The lottery procedure was improved the next year although public discontent continued to grow. For the draft lottery held on July 1, 1970 (which covered 1951 birthdates for use during 1971, and is sometimes called the 1971 draft), scientists at the National Bureau of Standards prepared 78 random permutations of the numbers 1 to 366 using random numbers selected from published tables. From the 78 permutations, 25 were selected at random and transcribed to calendars using 1 = January 1, 2 = January 2, ... 365 = December 31. Those calendars were sealed in envelopes. 25 more permutations were selected and sealed in 25 more envelopes without transcription to calendars. The two sets of 25 envelopes were furnished to the Selective Service System. On June 2, an official picked two envelopes, thus one calendar and one raw permutation. The 365 birthdates (for 1951) were written down, placed in capsules, and put in a drum in the order dictated by the selected calendar. Similarly, the numbers from 1 to 365 were written down and placed into capsules in the order dictated by the raw permutation. On July 1, the drawing date, one drum was rotated for an hour and the other for a half-hour (its rotating mechanism failed). Pairs of capsules were then drawn, one from each drum, one with a 1951 birthdate and one with a number 1 to 366. The first date and number drawn were September 16 and 139, so all men born September 16, 1951, were assigned draft number 139. The 11th draws were the date July 9 and the number 1, so men born July 9 were assigned draft number 1 and drafted first. Draft lotteries were conducted again from 1971 to 1975 (for 1952 to 1956 births). The birth year of 1952 was the last draftees, with the assigned number 95 being the last number drafted, which represented those born on July 20, 1952. The draft numbers issued from 1972 to 1975 were not used to call any men into service as the last draft call was on December 7, and authority to induct expired July 1, 1973. They were used, however, to call some men born from 1953 to 1956 for armed forces physical examinations. The highest number called for a physical was 215 (for tables 1970 through 1976). Between 1965 and 1972 the draft provided 2,215,000 service members to the U.S. military.  Present day use  In the present, not much has changed regarding how the draft would be conducted if it were required in the future. The Selective Service Committee, which presides over draft procedures, has stored the large tumbler that holds all the numbers and dates that would be drawn to select candidates, and the only obvious change between the method of the past and the present is that instead of using pieces of paper in blue capsules, the SSC now uses ping-pong balls with the dates and numbers on them.

Spence was a Fellow of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, and Vice-President of the Scottish Anthropological and Folklore Society.Brief details of his career are available in the introduction to the 1997 reprint of An Encyclopaedia of Occultism (on-line text). He founded the Scottish National Movement. Early life Spence was born in 1874 in Monifieth, Angus, Scotland. After graduating from Edinburgh University he pursued a career in journalism. He was an editor at The Scotsman 1899-1906, editor of The Edinburgh Magazine for a year, 1904‚Äì05, then an editor at The British Weekly, 1906-09. Career In this time Spence's interest was sparked in the myth and folklore of Mexico and Central America, resulting in his popularisation of the Mayan Popul Vuh, the sacred book of the Quich√© Mayans (1908). He compiled A Dictionary of Mythology (1910), an Encyclopedia of occultism and parapsychology (1920) and numerous additional volumes. Turning his interest closer to home, he investigated Scottish folklore. An ardent Scottish Nationalist, he unsuccessfully contested a parliamentary seat for Midlothian and Peebles Northern at a by-election in 1929. He also wrote poetry, collected in 1953. Spence wrote about Brythonic rites and traditions in Mysteries of Celtic Britain (1905). In this book, Spence theorized that the original Britons were descendants of a people that migrated from Northwest Africa and were probably related to the Berbers and the Basques.The Mysteries of Britain, Lewis Spence, Health Research Books, 1996, p. 21More nuanced recent views, based on early DNA research, are presented by the Oxford geneticist Bryan Sykes, in Blood of the Isles, 2006. Atlantis Spence's researches into the mythology and culture of the New World, together with his examination of the cultures of western Europe and north-west Africa, led him to the question of Atlantis. During the 1920s he published a series of books which sought to rescue the topic from the occultists who had more or less brought it into disrepute. These works, including The Problem of Atlantis (1924) and History of Atlantis (1927), adopted theories inaugurated by Ignatius Donnelly and looked at the lost island as a Bronze Age civilization that formed a cultural link with the New World, which he invoked through examples he found of parallels between the early civilizations of the Old and New Worlds. Despite Spence's erudition and the width of his reading, the conclusions he reached, avoiding peer-reviewed journals,Though Spence wrote reviews of popularizations of mythology and folklore for Folklore. have been almost universally rejected by mainstream scholarship. His popularisations met stiff criticism in professional journals, but his continued appeal among theory hobbyists is summed up by a reviewer of The Problem of Atlantis (1924) in The Geographical Journal: \\"Mr. Spence is an industrious writer, and, even if he fails to convince, has done service in marshalling the evidence and has produced an entertaining volume which is well worth reading.\\"R.N.R.B. in The Geographical Journal 64.2 (August 1924:181-182). Nevertheless, he seems to have had some influence upon the ideas of controversial author Immanuel Velikovsky, and as his books have come into the public domain, they have been successfully reprinted and some have been scanned for the Internet. Spence's 1940 book Occult Causes of the Present War () is an early book in the field of Nazi occultism. Personal life In 1899 he married Helen Bruce. Over his long career, he published more than forty books, many of which remain in print to this day. Spence was also the founder of the Scottish National Movement which later merged to form the National Party of Scotland and which in turn merged to form the Scottish National Party. Death Spence died in Edinburgh in 1955 aged 80 and is buried in the north-west section of the 20th century northern extension to Dean Cemetery in western Edinburgh. His wife, Helen S. Bruce (d. 1942) lies with him.

Honolulu was launched in 1937 and commissioned in 1938. The ship served in the Battle of Tassafaronga, the Battle of Kula Gulf, the Battle of Kolombangara and the Battle of Peleliu. She was taken out of action by serious torpedo damage just before the Battle of Leyte Gulf. She was repaired, but not in time to rejoin the war. She was decommissioned in 1947 and was held in reserve until she was scrapped in 1959.  Inter-war period  The second Navy ship named for the city of Honolulu, Hawaii, she was launched on 26 August 1937 at the New York Navy Yard, sponsored by Helen Poindexter (the daughter of Joseph B. Poindexter, the Governor of Hawaii), and commissioned on 15 June 1938, with Captain Oscar Smith in command. After a shakedown cruise to England, Honolulu engaged in fleet problems and exercises in the Caribbean Sea. She steamed from New York on 24 May 1939 to join the Pacific Fleet, arriving at San Pedro, California, on 14 June. For the remainder of the year, she engaged in exercises along the West Coast. During the first half of 1940, Honolulu continued operations out of Long Beach, California, and after an overhaul at the Puget Sound shipyard, she steamed out of Long Beach Naval Shipyard on 5 November for duty from Pearl Harbor. She operated there through 1941, and she was moored at the Naval Station when the Japanese launched their attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. Honolulu suffered only minor hull damage from a near miss.  World War II  Following repairs, she sailed on 12 January 1942 to escort a convoy to San Francisco, California, arriving on 21 January. The cruiser continued convoy escort duty to Australia, Samoa, and the United States until late May. With the Japanese pushing north towards Alaska, Honolulu departed on 29 May to strengthen forces in that area. After two months of continuous operations out of Kodiak, Alaska, she proceeded to Kiska in the Aleutian Islands on 7 August, to begin bombardment of the island. On 21 August, she screened the first American landings in the Aleutians at Adak Island. After shipyard work at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Honolulu departed from San Francisco on 3 November 1942, escorting a convoy to Noum√©a in the South Pacific. Later that month, Honolulu sailed from Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides Islands to intercept a Japanese Navy convoy attempting to reinforce their positions on Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands. The Battle of Tassafaronga began shortly before midnight on 30 November, continuing through the night. One Japanese destroyer was sunk by American cruiser gunfire, but four cruisers were hit by Japanese torpedoes, with one of the cruisers, , sinking. Honolulu escaped serious damage in this notable Japanese victory that had very little impact on the fighting on Guadalcanal. Honolulu retires towards Tulagi after the Battle of Kula Gulf Honolulu operated out of Espiritu Santo in early 1943 with Task Force 67 (TF 67) in an attempt to engage the \\"Tokyo Express\\". During May, she engaged in bombardments of New Georgia in the Solomons. Honolulu departed from Espiritu Santo on 28 June for more bombardments in the Solomons. After supporting the landings on New Georgia Island on 4 July, she opened fire on enemy ships in the Battle of Kula Gulf, knocking out one destroyer and assisting in the destruction of others. The battle-proven cruiser had another opportunity to confront the Japanese fleet on 13 July, in the Battle of Kolombangara. Shortly after midnight, contact was made with an enemy cruiser-destroyer force in \\"The Slot\\". At 0110, Honolulu opened fire on a . After three salvos, the target burst into flames and was soon dead in the water. Honolulu shifted fire to an enemy destroyer, which was immediately hit and disappeared. At 0211, a torpedo struck the starboard side of Honolulu, blowing off her bow. The task force then retired to Tulagi for temporary repairs, and then departed for the large naval base at Pearl Harbor. On 16 August, Honolulu arrived at Pearl Harbor for major repairs. She then proceeded to the shipyard at Mare Island, near San Francisco, for more work. Honolulus collapsed bow, 20 July 1943, after she was torpedoed at the battle of Kolombangara. After the additional repairs at Mare Island, Honolulu departed from San Francisco on 17 November to continue her role in the struggle against Japan. She arrived at Espiritu Santo on 11 December, and then resumed operations in the Solomons later that month. On 27 December, she engaged in the bombardment of an enemy barge, troop, and supply concentration on Bougainville Island. In the early months of 1944, the cruiser continued bombardments and patrols in the Solomon Islands. She screened the landings on Green Island on 13 February, before retiring from the Solomons to begin preparations for the Saipan and Guam operations in the Mariana Islands. Honolulu took part in bombardments of the southeastern part of Saipan Island in early June as the Navy and Marines leaped across the Pacific. While bombarding Guam in mid-June, Honolulu was deployed northwest to intercept the Japanese fleet. She returned to Eniwetok Atoll on 28 June for replenishments, before providing support for the invasion of Guam. She remained on station for three weeks, performing great service with her accurate gunfire, before returning to Purvis Bay on Florida Island in the Solomons on 18 August. Honolulu steamed out on 6 September to provide fire support for the landings in the Palau Islands, such as at Peleliu Island and Anguar, remaining in this area during September unopposed by the Japanese fleet. America now had decisive command of the sea, and therefore nearly full freedom of operations. = Battle of Leyte = Honolulu departed from the staging area at Manus Island in the Admiralty Islands on 12 October, and steamed towards the Philippines for the invasion of Leyte. She began a bombardment from Leyte Gulf on 19 October, and the next day she began screening the landings. At 1600, on 20 October an enemy torpedo plane was sighted as it aimed its torpedo at Honolulu. Despite the skillful maneuvering of Captain Thurber to evade, the torpedo found its mark on her port side. Honolulu sailed out the next day, arriving at Manus on 29 October for temporary repairs, and then steamed for Norfolk, Virginia, on 19 November, arriving on 20 December via Pearl Harbor, San Diego, California, and the Panama Canal. Honolulu remained at Norfolk for the duration of the war, undergoing repairs, and after a shakedown cruise in October 1945, she steamed to Newport, Rhode Island, for duty as a training ship. Honolulu arrived at Philadelphia on 8 January 1946 and was decommissioned there on 3 February 1947, and joined the Reserve Fleet at Philadelphia. Stricken on 1 March 1959, Honolulu was sold for scrapping to Bethlehem Steel on 17 November 1959.

Another word for mystagogue is hierophant. In ancient mystery religions, a mystagogue would be responsible for leading an initiate into the secret teachings and rituals of a cultus. The initiate would often be blindfolded, and the mystagogue would literally \\"guide\\" him into the sacred space. In the early Christian church, this same concept was used to describe role of the bishop, who was responsible for seeing to it that the catechumens were properly prepared for baptism. Mystagogical homilies, or homilies that dealt with the Church's sacraments, were given to those in the last stages of preparation for full Church membership. Sometimes these mystagogical instructions were not given until after the catechumen had been baptized. The most famous of these mystagogical works are the \\"Mystagogical Homilies\\" of St. Cyril of Jerusalem, and the work, \\"On the Mysteries\\" by St. Ambrose of Milan. In various organizations, it is the role of the mystagogue to \\"mystify\\" pledges. The term is sometimes used to refer to a person who guides people through religious sites, such as churches, and explains the various artifacts. This branch of theology is at times called mystagogy. In the United States versions of mystagogical legends predate European contact. Early Native American tribes around the Great Lakes region, taught that the mystagogue was a spiritual leader, and upon death would transform into a beast with many heads. The mystagogue would reappear in his beastly form and feed on those who strayed from the tribe if it was not in keeping with their religious customs. The historical tradition of the mystagogue has carried on today in one way through the fraternity system in American universities, that have historically held a position for a mystagogue at either the chapter or the national level. The mystagogue is a person of great respect, and his knowledge concerning both the physical and spiritual matters of the organization is not questioned. In a way similar to that of some Native American traditions, the mystagogue in the fraternity system has the power to shut down parts of the fraternity which are not in keeping with customs or tradition. Max Weber, considered to be one of the founders of the modern study of sociology, described the mystagogue as part magician and part prophet, and as one who dispensed \\"magical actions that contain the boons of salvation.\\" According to Roy Wallis: \\"The primary criterion that Weber had in mind in distinguishing the prophet from the mystagogue was that the latter offers a largely magical means of salvation rather than proclaiming a radical religious ethic or an example to be followed.\\" See also * Hierophant * Sacred mysteries References Category:Mystics Category:Christian terminology Category:Religious occupations es:Mistagogo ","title":"Mystagogue"},{"id":"549114","text":"The tower at Christmas The Gerbrandy Tower () is a tower in IJsselstein, the Netherlands. It was built in 1961. Description The Gerbrandy Tower is used for directional radio services and for FM- and TV-broadcasting. The Gerbrandy Tower consists of a concrete tower with a height of 100 meters on which a guyed aerial mast is mounted. Its total height was originally 382.5 metres, but in 1987 it was reduced to 375 metres. On August 2, 2007 its analog antenna was replaced by a digital one reducing its height by another 9 metres. Its height is now 366.8 metres. This tower type is a partially guyed tower, which combines a lower free standing tower antennas with an upper guyed mast. If the structure is counted as a tower, it is the tallest tower in Western Europe. The Gerbrandy Tower is not the only tower which consists of a concrete tower on which a guyed mast is set. There is one similar but smaller tower with the same structure in the Netherlands, the radio tower of Zendstation Smilde, which consisted of an 80 metres high concrete tower, on which a 223.5 metres high guyed mast was mounted. This structure collapsed after a fire on July 15th, 2011. Rebuilding of that tower started in late 2011 and was completed in October 2012; the replacement structure is also a partially guyed tower, now 303 metres high. =Naming= The tower is named after Pieter Gerbrandy, Prime Minister of the Netherlands during World War Two. Nearby, there is another remarkable antenna: the KNMI-mast Cabauw, a mast used for meteorological measurements. Another nearby antenna, the 196m high mediumwave transmitter Lopik, was demolished on September 4th, 2015. Fires in Dutch TV masts On July 15th, 2011 there was a small fire in the Gerbrandy tower. Only hours later, a similar tower in Smilde caught fire and collapsed, after which all transmitters in the Gerbrandy tower were shut down as a precaution, leaving large parts of the Netherlands without FM-radio and digital TV (DVB-T) reception. Owner The ownership of the tower is complex: the concrete main structure is owned by Alticom: a company established in 2007 that bought many assets from KPN. Alticom was part of the European TDG Group, but in June 2011 it was announced that all shares in Alticom were acquired by investment company InfracapitalPress-release Infracapital buys Alticom , 8 June, 2011, retrieved 27 July, 2011 who are the infrastructure specialists of Prudential plc. Alticom is the owner of the concrete base and the first three meters of ground around this base. The metal mast on top of the structure is owned by NOVEC, which is a subsidiary of the electricity transmission operator TenneT. And the ground on which the tower is built, excluding the first three meters around the base, is (still) owned by KPN.Report about working safely in Radio and TV-masts: Veilig werken op hoog nivo (Dutch), 8 August, 2007, retrieved 25 July, 2011 See also * List of towers * List of masts Sources External links * * Drawings at SkyscraperPage.com * World's Greatest Christmas Tree Foundation Category:Communication towers in the Netherlands Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1961 Category:Buildings and structures in Utrecht (province) Category:IJsselstein ","title":"Gerbrandy Tower"},{"id":"549117","title":"United States Navy officer rank insignia"},{"id":"549128","text":"Prole or proles may refer to: * A member of the proletariat, a lower social class, or the working class * Proles (Nineteen Eighty-Four), the proletariat class in George Orwell's 1949 novel * Prole, Iowa, a community in the midwestern United States * Pr√≥le, a village in Poland * Proles, a synonym for race in biological taxonomy ","title":"Prole"},{"id":"549129","text":"Cloverleaf or clover leaf may refer to: Plant *The leaf of the clover plant, or its shape Companies *Clover Leaf Seafoods, Markham, Ontario- based marketer of seafood products Places *Cloverleaf, Louisville, Kentucky, a neighborhood *Cloverleaf, Texas, a suburb of Houston *Cloverleaf Local School District in southern Medina County, Ohio Science and technology *A representation of the chemical structure of a transfer RNA molecule *The IEC 60320 C5, and C6 electrical power connectors, sometimes colloquially called cloverleaf connections *Cloverleaf quasar, a rare example of a quadruply-lensed quasar *Command key in apple computer, '‚åò', colloquially known as the \\"cloverleaf\\" key * The 4-round capacity model of the Colt House Revolver, a 19th-century handgun.

The Liberation Tower is a 372-meter-high telecommunications tower in Kuwait City, Kuwait, the second-tallest structure in the country and the 39th tallest building in the world. The tower is not publicly accessible to tourists. However, the complex building attached to the tower houses government offices such as the Communication and Information Technology Regulatory Authority and a government service center that offer civil services related to Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Public Authority For Civil Information, Ministry of Justice, Public Institution for Social Security, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Fire Service Directorate, and Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour. History Originally intended to be named The Kuwait Telecommunications Tower, construction of the tower commenced before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on August 2, 1990. When the invasion took place, construction, which was almost half-way complete, was put on hold. However, the structure received no damage, and construction resumed after Iraqi forces were expelled on February 27, 1991. Upon completion in 1993, the tower was renamed the Liberation Tower, symbolizing Kuwait's liberation from Iraq.

The effect was named by psychologist Ellen Langer and has been replicated in many different contexts. It is thought to influence gambling behavior and belief in the paranormal. Along with illusory superiority and optimism bias, the illusion of control is one of the positive illusions. The illusion might arise because people lack direct introspective insight into whether they are in control of events. This has been called the introspection illusion. Instead they may judge their degree of control by a process that is often unreliable. As a result, they see themselves as responsible for events when there is little or no causal link. In one study, college students were in a virtual reality setting to treat a fear of heights using an elevator. Those who were told that they had control, yet had none, felt as though they had as much control as those who actually did have control over the elevator. Those who were led to believe they did not have control said they felt as though they had little control. Psychological theorists have consistently emphasized the importance of perceptions of control over life events. One of the earliest instances of this is when Alfred Adler argued that people strive for proficiency in their lives. Heider later proposed that humans have a strong motive to control their environment and Wyatt Mann hypothesized a basic competence motive that people satisfy by exerting control. Wiener, an attribution theorist, modified his original theory of achievement motivation to include a controllability dimension. Kelley then argued that people's failure to detect noncontingencies may result in their attributing uncontrollable outcomes to personal causes. Nearer to the present, Taylor and Brown argued that positive illusions, including the illusion of control, foster mental health. The illusion is more common in familiar situations, and in situations where the person knows the desired outcome. Feedback that emphasizes success rather than failure can increase the effect, while feedback that emphasizes failure can decrease or reverse the effect. The illusion is weaker for depressed individuals and is stronger when individuals have an emotional need to control the outcome. The illusion is strengthened by stressful and competitive situations, including financial trading. Although people are likely to overestimate their control when the situations are heavily chance-determined, they also tend to underestimate their control when they actually have it, which runs contrary to some theories of the illusion and its adaptiveness. People also showed a higher illusion of control when they were allowed to become familiar with a task through practice trials, make their choice before the event happens like with throwing dice, and when they can make their choice rather than have it made for them with the same odds. People are more likely to show control when they have more answers right at the beginning than at the end, even when the people had the same number of correct answers. By proxy At times, people attempt to gain control by transferring responsibility to more capable or ‚Äúluckier‚Äù others to act for them. By forfeiting direct control, it is perceived to be a valid way of maximizing outcomes. This illusion of control by proxy is a significant theoretical extension of the traditional illusion of control model. People will of course give up control if another person is thought to have more knowledge or skill in areas such as medicine where actual skill and knowledge are involved. In cases like these it is entirely rational to give up responsibility to people such as doctors. However, when it comes to events of pure chance, allowing another to make decisions (or gamble) on one's behalf, because they are seen as luckier is not rational and would go against people's well-documented desire for control in uncontrollable situations. However, it does seem plausible since people generally believe that they can possess luck and employ it to advantage in games of chance, and it is not a far leap that others may also be seen as lucky and able to control uncontrollable events. In one instance, a lottery pool at a company decides who picks the numbers and buys the tickets based on the wins and losses of each member. The member with the best record becomes the representative until they accumulate a certain number of losses and then a new representative is picked based on wins and losses. Even though no member is truly better than the other and it is all by chance, they still would rather have someone with seemingly more luck to have control over them. In another real-world example, in the 2002 Olympics men's and women's hockey finals, Team Canada beat Team USA but it was later believed that the win was the result of the luck of a Canadian coin that was secretly placed under the ice before the game. The members of Team Canada were the only people who knew the coin had been placed there. The coin was later put in the Hockey Hall of Fame where there was an opening so people could touch it. People believed they could transfer luck from the coin to themselves by touching it, and thereby change their own luck. Demonstration The illusion of control is demonstrated by three converging lines of evidence: 1) laboratory experiments, 2) observed behavior in familiar games of chance such as lotteries, and 3) self-reports of real-world behavior. One kind of laboratory demonstration involves two lights marked \\"Score\\" and \\"No Score\\". Subjects have to try to control which one lights up. In one version of this experiment, subjects could press either of two buttons. Another version had one button, which subjects decided on each trial to press or not. Subjects had a variable degree of control over the lights, or none at all, depending on how the buttons were connected. The experimenters made clear that there might be no relation between the subjects' actions and the lights. Subjects estimated how much control they had over the lights. These estimates bore no relation to how much control they actually had, but was related to how often the \\"Score\\" light lit up. Even when their choices made no difference at all, subjects confidently reported exerting some control over the lights. Ellen Langer's research demonstrated that people were more likely to behave as if they could exercise control in a chance situation where \\"skill cues\\" were present. By skill cues, Langer meant properties of the situation more normally associated with the exercise of skill, in particular the exercise of choice, competition, familiarity with the stimulus and involvement in decisions. One simple form of this effect is found in casinos: when rolling dice in a craps game people tend to throw harder when they need high numbers and softer for low numbers. In another experiment, subjects had to predict the outcome of thirty coin tosses. The feedback was rigged so that each subject was right exactly half the time, but the groups differed in where their \\"hits\\" occurred. Some were told that their early guesses were accurate. Others were told that their successes were distributed evenly through the thirty trials. Afterwards, they were surveyed about their performance. Subjects with early \\"hits\\" overestimated their total successes and had higher expectations of how they would perform on future guessing games. This result resembles the irrational primacy effect in which people give greater weight to information that occurs earlier in a series. Forty percent of the subjects believed their performance on this chance task would improve with practice, and twenty-five percent said that distraction would impair their performance. Another of Langer's experiments‚Äîreplicated by other researchers‚Äîinvolves a lottery. Subjects are either given tickets at random or allowed to choose their own. They can then trade their tickets for others with a higher chance of paying out. Subjects who had chosen their own ticket were more reluctant to part with it. Tickets bearing familiar symbols were less likely to be exchanged than others with unfamiliar symbols. Although these lotteries were random, subjects behaved as though their choice of ticket affected the outcome. Participants who chose their own numbers were less likely to trade their ticket even for one in a game with better odds. Another way to investigate perceptions of control is to ask people about hypothetical situations, for example their likelihood of being involved in a motor vehicle accident. On average, drivers regard accidents as much less likely in \\"high- control\\" situations, such as when they are driving, than in \\"low-control\\" situations, such as when they are in the passenger seat. They also rate a high-control accident, such as driving into the car in front, as much less likely than a low-control accident such as being hit from behind by another driver. Explanations Ellen Langer, who first demonstrated the illusion of control, explained her findings in terms of a confusion between skill and chance situations. She proposed that people base their judgments of control on \\"skill cues\\". These are features of a situation that are usually associated with games of skill, such as competitiveness, familiarity and individual choice. When more of these skill cues are present, the illusion is stronger. Suzanne Thompson and colleagues argued that Langer's explanation was inadequate to explain all the variations in the effect. As an alternative, they proposed that judgments about control are based on a procedure that they called the \\"control heuristic\\". This theory proposes that judgments of control to depend on two conditions; an intention to create the outcome, and a relationship between the action and outcome. In games of chance, these two conditions frequently go together. As well as an intention to win, there is an action, such as throwing a die or pulling a lever on a slot machine, which is immediately followed by an outcome. Even though the outcome is selected randomly, the control heuristic would result in the player feeling a degree of control over the outcome. Self-regulation theory offers another explanation. To the extent that people are driven by internal goals concerned with the exercise of control over their environment, they will seek to reassert control in conditions of chaos, uncertainty or stress. One way of coping with a lack of real control is to falsely attribute oneself control of the situation. The core self-evaluations (CSE) trait is a stable personality trait composed of locus of control, neuroticism, self-efficacy, and self-esteem. While those with high core self-evaluations are likely to believe that they control their own environment (i.e., internal locus of control), very high levels of CSE may lead to the illusion of control. Benefits and costs to the individual Taylor and Brown have argued that positive illusions, including the illusion of control, are adaptive as they motivate people to persist at tasks when they might otherwise give up. This position is supported by Albert Bandura's claim that \\"optimistic self-appraisals of capability, that are not unduly disparate from what is possible, can be advantageous, whereas veridical judgements can be self-limiting\\". His argument is essentially concerned with the adaptive effect of optimistic beliefs about control and performance in circumstances where control is possible, rather than perceived control in circumstances where outcomes do not depend on an individual's behavior. Bandura has also suggested that: > \\"In activities where the margins of error are narrow and missteps can > produce costly or injurious consequences, personal well-being is best served > by highly accurate efficacy appraisal.\\"Bandura, A. (1997). Self-efficacy: > The exercise of control. New York: W.H. Freeman and Company. Taylor and Brown argue that positive illusions are adaptive, since there is evidence that they are more common in normally mentally healthy individuals than in depressed individuals. However, Pacini, Muir and Epstein have shown that this may be because depressed people overcompensate for a tendency toward maladaptive intuitive processing by exercising excessive rational control in trivial situations, and note that the difference with non-depressed people disappears in more consequential circumstances. There is also empirical evidence that high self-efficacy can be maladaptive in some circumstances. In a scenario-based study, Whyte et al. showed that participants in whom they had induced high self-efficacy were significantly more likely to escalate commitment to a failing course of action. Knee and Zuckerman have challenged the definition of mental health used by Taylor and Brown and argue that lack of illusions is associated with a non-defensive personality oriented towards growth and learning and with low ego involvement in outcomes. They present evidence that self-determined individuals are less prone to these illusions. In the late 1970s, Abramson and Alloy demonstrated that depressed individuals held a more accurate view than their non-depressed counterparts in a test which measured illusion of control. This finding held true even when the depression was manipulated experimentally. However, when replicating the findings Msetfi et al. (2005, 2007) found that the overestimation of control in nondepressed people only showed up when the interval was long enough, implying that this is because they take more aspects of a situation into account than their depressed counterparts. Also, Dykman et al. (1989) showed that depressed people believe they have no control in situations where they actually do, so their perception is not more accurate overall. Allan et al. (2007) has proposed that the pessimistic bias of depressives resulted in \\"depressive realism\\" when asked about estimation of control, because depressed individuals are more likely to say no even if they have control. A number of studies have found a link between a sense of control and health, especially in older people. Fenton-O'Creevy et al. argue, as do Gollwittzer and Kinney, that while illusory beliefs about control may promote goal striving, they are not conducive to sound decision-making. Illusions of control may cause insensitivity to feedback, impede learning and predispose toward greater objective risk taking (since subjective risk will be reduced by illusion of control). Applications Psychologist Daniel Wegner argues that an illusion of control over external events underlies belief in psychokinesis, a supposed paranormal ability to move objects directly using the mind. As evidence, Wegner cites a series of experiments on magical thinking in which subjects were induced to think they had influenced external events. In one experiment, subjects watched a basketball player taking a series of free throws. When they were instructed to visualise him making his shots, they felt that they had contributed to his success. One study examined traders working in the City of London's investment banks. They each watched a graph being plotted on a computer screen, similar to a real-time graph of a stock price or index. Using three computer keys, they had to raise the value as high as possible. They were warned that the value showed random variations, but that the keys might have some effect. In fact, the fluctuations were not affected by the keys. The traders' ratings of their success measured their susceptibility to the illusion of control. This score was then compared with each trader's performance. Those who were more prone to the illusion scored significantly lower on analysis, risk management and contribution to profits. They also earned significantly less.Fenton-O'Creevy, M., Nicholson, N. and Soane, E., Willman, P.

At in elevation, it is the third-highest mountain in Iran. It has a permanent crater lake formed at its summit. On one of its slopes around in elevation there are large rock formations of eroded volcanic outcrops that resemble animals, birds, and insects. Map of summit region and glaciers of Sabalan. Mount Sabalan Located in the extreme northwest of Iran, Sabalan is the country's third-highest peak after Damavand and Alam-Kuh. It is also slightly higher than Mont Blanc in the Alps. The mountain offers many attractions throughout the year. On the slopes of the mountain, the mineral water from springs attracts large numbers of tourists each year, many of whom have faith in healing properties attributed to the springs. The nomadic people of the area live in small villages, with their round \\"Yurt\\" tents appealing to tourism. Sabalan has a ski resort (Alvares) and different tourist areas such as the Sarein spa. The mountain is known for its beautiful vistas, including the Shirvan gorge, where few climbers ever venture. Geology Sabalan is a large andesite stratovolcano in Meshgin Shahr, in Ardabil Province in Iran. It is the second-highest volcano after Mount Damavand. The volcano is quite old. Its first eruptions occurred in the Eocene and later in the Miocene. But the main volcanism happened in the Pliocene and the Pleistocene as some of its rocks have been dated to 5‚Äì1.4 million years. Some references state that volcanic activity continued into the Holocene, less than 10,000 years ago. The summit region has several peaks exceeding , primarily along a southwest-northeast trending ridge. The highest point is at the northeast end of the ridge, and is separated from the + group of southwestern summits by a col. The mountain is located in a continental climate with hot, dry summers and extremely cold, snowy winters. Precipitation falls primarily as snow in late autumn, winter, and spring, and is sufficient to sustain seven glaciers near the summit above . The largest of these were more than in length as of the 1970s. There are also extensive rock glaciers, several of which are more than in length. Climbing The climbing surface includes rocks of various sizes (Class 2 scrambling), and a moderate degree of fitness is required to climb it. The climb from the base camp starts easy, becomes challenging midway, then eases in gradient near the top. The lake on the top remains frozen except for about four weeks in late July to early August. Some climbers start by driving to hot springs of Meshgin Shahr, where they start their climb. This climb takes about two days, reaching the base camp on the first day. Others take a taxi to base camp early in the morning and climb the mountain in one day. In 2006, there was talk of improving the road to the base camp. If this is done, a regular car should be able to make it to the base camp during the climbing season. The road goes through multiple nomadic encampments of shepherds. One or two days of acclimatization in Tehran or Ardabil may be advisable. Mountaineering has been popular among the youth in Iran. On a Friday during the climbing season (late June to mid-August), one may find hundreds of people on the mountain. Guides can also be found in Ardabil. Adequate climbing equipment can be purchased in Ardabil or Tehran. Surrounding area The area around Sabalan, particularly near Meshkin and Dasht-eh Moghan, produces large quantities of grain, including wheat. Due to the microclimate produced by the mountain, Ardabil remains pleasantly cool in the summers. There are numerous hot springs around the slopes of Sabalan, with the main concentration within Sareyn County. There are skiing slopes, with snow even in near-summer. A ski resort named \\"Alvares\\" is within an hour's drive from Sareyn on the south ridge of Sabalan.

Warehouses are used by manufacturers, importers, exporters, wholesalers, transport businesses, customs, etc. They are usually large plain buildings in industrial parks on the outskirts of cities, towns, or villages. They usually have loading docks to load and unload goods from trucks. Sometimes warehouses are designed for the loading and unloading of goods directly from railways, airports, or seaports. They often have cranes and forklifts for moving goods, which are usually placed on ISO standard pallets loaded into pallet racks. Stored goods can include any raw materials, packing materials, spare parts, components, or finished goods associated with agriculture, manufacturing, and production. In India and Hong Kong, a warehouse may be referred to as a \\"godown\\". \\"Late 16th century from Portuguese gud√£o, from Tamil ki·π≠a·πÖku, Malayalam ki·π≠a·πÖ·πÖu, or Kannada gada·πÖgu ‚Äòstore, warehouse‚Äô.\\" There are also godowns in the Shanghai Bund. History =Prehistory and ancient history= A warehouse can be defined functionally as a building in which to store bulk produce or goods (wares) for commercial purposes. The built form of warehouse structures throughout time depends on many contexts: materials, technologies, sites, and cultures. In this sense, the warehouse postdates the need for communal or state-based mass storage of surplus food. Prehistoric civilizations relied on family- or community-owned storage pits, or ‚Äòpalace‚Äô storerooms, such as at Knossos, to protect surplus food. The archaeologist Colin Renfrew argued that gathering and storing agricultural surpluses in Bronze Age Minoan ‚Äòpalaces‚Äô was a critical ingredient in the formation of proto-state power. Ostia; an ancient Roman city The need for warehouses developed in societies in which trade reached a critical mass requiring storage at some point in the exchange process. This was highly evident in ancient Rome, where the horreum (pl. horrea) became a standard building form. The most studied examples are in Ostia, the port city that served Rome. The Horrea Galbae, a warehouse complex on the road towards Ostia, demonstrates that these buildings could be substantial, even by modern standards. Galba's horrea complex contained 140 rooms on the ground floor alone, covering an area of some 225,000 square feet (21,000 m¬≤). As a point of reference, less than half of U.S. warehouses today are larger than 100,000 square feet (9290 m¬≤). =Medieval Europe= A Sust, a Middle Ages type of warehouse, in Horgen, Switzerland The need for a warehouse implies having quantities of goods too big to be stored in a domestic storeroom. But as attested by legislation concerning the levy of duties, some medieval merchants across Europe commonly kept goods in their large household storerooms, often on the ground floor or cellars. An example is the Fondaco dei Tedeschi, the substantial quarters of German traders in Venice, which combined a dwelling, warehouse, market and quarters for travellers. From the Middle Ages on, dedicated warehouses were constructed around ports and other commercial hubs to facilitate large-scale trade. The warehouses of the trading port Bryggen in Bergen, Norway (now a World Heritage site), demonstrate characteristic European gabled timber forms dating from the late Middle Ages, though what remains today was largely rebuilt in the same traditional style following great fires in 1702 and 1955. =Industrial revolution= Historic Atlantic Dock warehouse in Brooklyn in the 1800s During the industrial revolution of the mid 18th century, the function of warehouses evolved and became more specialised. The mass production of goods launched by the industrial revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries fuelled the development of larger and more specialised warehouses, usually located close to transport hubs on canals, at railways and portside. Specialisation of tasks is characteristic of the factory system, which developed in British textile mills and potteries in the mid-late 1700s. Factory processes speeded up work and deskilled labour, bringing new profits to capital investment. Warehouses also fulfill a range of commercial functions besides simple storage, exemplified by Manchester's cotton warehouses and Australian wool stores: receiving, stockpiling and despatching goods; displaying goods for commercial buyers; packing, checking and labelling orders, and dispatching them. The utilitarian architecture of warehouses responded fast to emerging technologies. Before and into the nineteenth century, the basic European warehouse was built of load-bearing masonry walls or heavy-framed timber with a suitable external cladding. Inside, heavy timber posts supported timber beams and joists for the upper levels, rarely more than four to five stories high. 19th-century warehouses in Gloucester docks in the United Kingdom, originally used to store imported corn A gabled roof was conventional, with a gate in the gable facing the street, rail lines or port for a crane to hoist goods into the window-gates on each floor below. Convenient access for road transport was built-in via very large doors on the ground floor. If not in a separate building, office and display spaces were located on the ground or first floor. Technological innovations of the early 19th century changed the shape of warehouses and the work performed inside them: cast iron columns and later, moulded steel posts; saw-tooth roofs; and steam power. All (except steel) were adopted quickly and were in common use by the middle of the 19th century. Strong, slender cast iron columns began to replace masonry piers or timber posts to carry levels above the ground floor. As modern steel framing developed in the late 19th century, its strength and constructability enabled the first skyscrapers. Steel girders replaced timber beams, increasing the span of internal bays in the warehouse. The saw-tooth roof brought natural light to the top story of the warehouse. It transformed the shape of the warehouse, from the traditional peaked hip or gable to an essentially flat roof form that was often hidden behind a parapet. Warehouse buildings now became strongly horizontal. Inside the top floor, the vertical glazed pane of each saw-tooth enabled natural lighting over displayed goods, improving buyer inspection. Hoists and cranes driven by steam power expanded the capacity of manual labour to lift and move heavy goods. =20th century= Aisle with pallets on storage racks in a modern warehouse Two new power sources, hydraulics and electricity, re-shaped warehouse design and practice at the end of the 19th century and into the 20th century. Public hydraulic power networks were constructed in many large industrial cities around the world in the 1870s-80s, exemplified by Manchester. They were highly effective to power cranes and lifts, whose application in warehouses served taller buildings and enabled new labour efficiencies. Public electricity networks emerged in the 1890s. They were used at first mainly for lighting and soon to electrify lifts, making possible taller, more efficient warehouses. It took several decades for electrical power to be distributed widely throughout cities in the western world. 20th-century technologies made warehousing ever more efficient. Electricity became widely available and transformed lighting, security, lifting and transport from the 1900s. The internal combustion engine, developed in the late 19th century, was installed in mass-produced vehicles from the 1910s. It not only reshaped transport methods but enabled many applications as a compact, portable power plant, wherever small engines were needed. The forklift truck was invented in the early 20th century and came into wide use after World War II. Forklifts transformed the possibilities of multi-level pallet racking of goods in taller, single-level steel-framed buildings for higher storage density. The forklift, and its load fixed to a uniform pallet, enabled the rise of logistic approaches to storage in the later 20th century. Always a building of function, in the late 20th century warehouses began to adapt to standardisation, mechanisation, technological innovation and changes in supply chain methods. Typology India House, Manchester. Warehouses are generally considered industrial buildings   * * and are usually located in industrial districts or zones (such as the outskirts of a city). LoopNet categorizes warehouses using the \\"industrial\\" property type. Craftsman Book Company's 2018 National Building Cost Manual lists \\"Warehouses\\" under the \\"Industrial Structures Section.\\" In the UK, warehouses are classified under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 as the industrial category B8 Storage and distribution. Types of warehouses include storage warehouses, distribution centers (including fulfillment centers and truck terminals), retail warehouses, cold storage warehouses, and flex space. = Retail warehouses = The Pickles Building 101 Portland Street, Manchester These displayed goods for the home trade. This would be finished goods- such as the latest cotton blouses or fashion items. Their street frontage was impressive, so they took the styles of Italianate Palazzi. Richard Cobden's construction in Manchester's Mosley Street was the first palazzo warehouse. There were already seven warehouses on Portland Street when S. & J. Watts & Co. commenced building the elaborate Watts Warehouse of 1855, but four more were opened before it was finished. = Cool warehouses and cold storage = Cold storage preserves agricultural products. Refrigerated storage helps in eliminating sprouting, rotting and insect damage. Edible products are generally not stored for more than one year. Several perishable products require a storage temperature as low as ‚àí25 ¬∞C. Cold storage helps stabilize market prices and evenly distribute goods both on demand and timely basis. The farmers get the opportunity of producing cash crops to get remunerative prices. The consumers get the supply of perishable commodities with lower fluctuation of prices. Ammonia and Freon compressors are commonly used in cold storage warehouses to maintain the temperature. Ammonia refrigerant is cheaper, easily available, and has a high latent heat of evaporation, but it is also highly toxic and can form an explosive mixture when mixed with fuel oil. Insulation is also important, to reduce the loss of cold and to keep different sections of the warehouse at different temperatures. There are two main types of refrigeration system used in cold storage warehouses: vapor absorption systems (VAS) and vapor-compression systems (VCS). VAS, although comparatively costlier to install, is more economical in operation. The temperature necessary for preservation depends on the storage time required and the type of product. In general, there are three groups of products, foods that are alive (e.g. fruits and vegetables), foods that are no longer alive and have been processed in some form (e.g. meat and fish products), and commodities that benefit from storage at controlled temperature (e.g. beer, tobacco). Location is important for the success of a cold storage facility. It should be in close proximity to a growing area as well as a market, be easily accessible for heavy vehicles, and have an uninterrupted power supply. = Overseas warehouses = These catered for the overseas trade. They became the meeting places for overseas wholesale buyers where printed and plain could be discussed and ordered. Trade in cloth in Manchester was conducted by many nationalities. Behrens Warehouse is on the corner of Oxford Street and Portland Street. It was built for Louis Behrens & Son by P Nunn in 1860. It is a four-storey predominantly red brick build with 23 bays along Portland Street and 9 along Oxford Street. The Behrens family were prominent in banking and in the social life of the German Community in Manchester. = Packing warehouses = Modern term: Fulfillment house The main purpose of packing warehouses was the picking, checking, labelling and packing of goods for export. The packing warehouses: Asia House, India House and Velvet House along Whitworth Street in Manchester were some of the tallest buildings of their time. See List of packing houses. = Railway warehouses = Warehouses were built close to the major stations in railway hubs. The first railway warehouse to be built was opposite the passenger platform at the terminus of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. There was an important group of warehouses around London Road station (now Piccadilly station).In the 1890s the Great Northern Railway Company‚Äôs warehouse was completed on Deansgate: this was the last major railway warehouse to be built. The London Warehouse Picadilly was one of four warehouses built by the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway in about 1865 to service the new London Road Station. It had its own branch to the Ashton Canal. This warehouse was built of brick with stone detailing. It had cast iron columns with wrought iron beams. = Canal warehouses = All these warehouse types can trace their origins back to the canal warehouses which were used for trans-shipment and storage. Castlefield warehouses in Manchester are of this type and important as they were built at the terminus of the Bridgewater Canal in 1761. Operations A customised storage building, a warehouse enables a business to stockpile goods, e.g., to build up a full load prior to transport, or hold unloaded goods before further distribution, or store goods like wine and cheese that require maturation. As a place for storage, the warehouse has to be secure, convenient, and as spacious as possible, according to the owner's resources, the site and contemporary building technology. Before mechanised technology developed, warehouse functions relied on human labour, using mechanical lifting aids like pulley systems. =Storage and shipping systems= Some of the most common warehouse storage systems are: * Pallet racking including selective, drive-in, drive-thru, double-deep, pushback, and gravity flow * Cantilever racking uses arms, rather than pallets, to store long thin objects like timber. * Mezzanine adds a semi-permanent story of storage within a warehouse * Vertical Lift Modules are packed systems with vertically arranged trays stored on both sides of the unit. * Horizontal Carousels consist of a frame and a rotating carriage of bins. * Vertical Carousels consisting of a series of carriers mounted on a vertical closed-loop track, inside a metal enclosure. A \\"piece pick\\" is a type of order selection process where a product is picked and handled in individual units and placed in an outer carton, tote or another container before shipping. Catalog companies and internet retailers are examples of predominantly piece-pick operations. Their customers rarely order in pallet or case quantities; instead, they typically order just one or two pieces of one or two items. Several elements make up the piece-pick system. They include the order, the picker, the pick module, the pick area, handling equipment, the container, the pick method used and the information technology used. Every movement inside a warehouse must be accompanied by a work order. Warehouse operation can fail when workers move goods without work orders, or when a storage position is left unregistered in the system. Material direction and tracking in a warehouse can be coordinated by a Warehouse Management System (WMS), a database driven computer program. Logistics personnel use the WMS to improve warehouse efficiency by directing pathways and to maintain accurate inventory by recording warehouse transactions. =Automation and optimization= Some warehouses are completely automated, and require only operators to work and handle all the task. Pallets and product move on a system of automated conveyors, cranes and automated storage and retrieval systems coordinated by programmable logic controllers and computers running logistics automation software. These systems are often installed in refrigerated warehouses where temperatures are kept very cold to keep the product from spoiling. This is especially true in electronics warehouses that require specific temperatures to avoid damaging parts. Automation is also common where land is expensive, as automated storage systems can use vertical space efficiently. These high-bay storage areas are often more than 10 meters (33 feet) high, with some over 20 meters (65 feet) high. Automated storage systems can be built up to 40m high. For a warehouse to function efficiently, the facility must be properly slotted. Slotting addresses which storage medium a product is picked from (pallet rack or carton flow), and how they are picked (pick-to-light, pick-to-voice, or pick-to-paper). With a proper slotting plan, a warehouse can improve its inventory rotation requirements‚Äîsuch as first in, first out (FIFO) and last in, first out (LIFO)‚Äîcontrol labor costs and increase productivity.Effectively Slotting a Warehouse or Distribution Center by Paul Hansen and Kelvin Gibson. Cygnus Supply and Demand Chain Executive. Accessed 2010-08-06. Pallet racks are commonly used to organize a warehouse. It is important to know the dimensions of racking and the number of bays needed as well as the dimensions of the product to be stored. Clearance should be accounted for if using a forklift or pallet mover to move inventory. Recent trends Modern warehouses commonly use a system of wide aisle pallet racking to store goods which can be loaded and unloaded using forklift trucks. Traditional warehousing has declined since the last decades of the 20th century, with the gradual introduction of Just In Time techniques. The JIT system promotes product delivery directly from suppliers to consumer without the use of warehouses. However, with the gradual implementation of offshore outsourcing and offshoring in about the same time period, the distance between the manufacturer and the retailer (or the parts manufacturer and the industrial plant) grew considerably in many domains, necessitating at least one warehouse per country or per region in any typical supply chain for a given range of products. Recent retailing trends have led to the development of warehouse-style retail stores. These high-ceiling buildings display retail goods on tall, heavy-duty industrial racks rather than conventional retail shelving. Typically, items ready for sale are on the bottom of the racks, and crated or palletized inventory is in the upper rack. Essentially, the same building serves as both a warehouse and retail store. Another trend relates to vendor-managed inventory (VMI). This gives the vendor the control to maintain the level of stock in the store. This method has its own issue that the vendor gains access to the warehouse. Large exporters and manufacturers use warehouses as distribution points for developing retail outlets in a particular region or country. This concept reduces end cost to the consumer and enhances the production sale ratio. Cross-docking is a specialised type of distribution center (DC) in that little or no inventory is stored and product is received, processed (if needed) and shipped within a short timeframe. As in warehousing, there are different types of cross-docks. Reverse logistics is another type of warehousing that has become popular for environmental reasons. The term refers to items that are going from the end user back to the distributor or manufacturer. Education  There are few non-profit organizations which are focused on imparting knowledge, education and research in the field of warehouse management and its role in the supply chain industry. The Warehousing Education and Research Council (WERC) and International Warehouse Logistics Association (IWLA) in Illinois, United States. They provide professional certification and continuing education programs for the industry in the country. The Australian College of Training have government funded programs to provide personal development and continuation training in warehousing certs II ‚Äì V (Diploma), they operate in Western Australia online and face to face, or Australia wide for online only courses.  Safety  Warehousing has unique health and safety challenges and has been recognized by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) as a priority industry sector in the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) to identify and provide intervention strategies regarding occupational health and safety issues.

He came from humble beginnings. He left school at the age of 12. At the outbreak of the First World War, he volunteered for the army. During his time in the forces, he started a troop concert party. On leaving the army, he took up work as a light comedian, dancer, and singer. He toured extensively appearing in variety, revues and by the early 1930s reached the top of the bill in the large music halls including the London Palladium. He recorded many songs, some which he wrote. He appeared frequently on radio, but television did not really suit his style. He appeared and starred in 14 feature films. He was known for his flamboyant suits, his wicked charm, and his risqu√© jokes which often got him into trouble with the censors. He made his last recording in January 1963 and died four months later. Biography =Early years= Miller was born as Thomas Henry Sargent on 21 November 1894 in Hereford Street, Kemptown, Brighton, Sussex. He was the second child of James Sargent, a labourer and Alice (n√©e West), a flower seller; Miller had three brothers and two sisters. His parents were poor and often unable to pay rent so were forced to move to other parts of the town. Owing to this, Miller frequently changed schools until he reached 12, when he left altogether. He tried various jobs, labouring, delivering milk, selling fish and chips, caddying at the Brighton and Hove Golf Course and finally trained to be a motor mechanic. As a youth he was nicknamed \\"Swanky Sargent\\". On the outbreak of the war in 1914, Miller volunteered for the army. He joined the Royal Sussex RegimentForces War Record/9875764/private-h-t-sargent-british-army-royal-sussex-regiment/ and, after serving in France, was posted to India and a year later to Mesopotamia, where he was temporarily blinded for three days. This experience stayed with him all his life, and in later years he did much work to help the blind. During his time in the army, he started a troops‚Äô concert party. =Start of career in show business= Demobilized from the army, he found work to be in short supply. He had lost his mother to the 1918 flu pandemic. He had his sights on performing in London and obtained a booking in the Shoreditch Hall in 1919. He was not experienced enough for the type of venue and lasted only a week. Returning to Brighton he saw an advertisement for artists to join Jack Sheppard's concert party in an alfresco theatre on Brighton beach. He applied and joined as a light comedian for the 1919 summer season. While with the concert party, he met his wife Frances Kathleen Marsh, who was a contralto in the group. Kathleen Marsh came from a middle-class family whose parents came to Brighton from Dorset shortly before she was born in 1896. Her elder brother Ernest Marsh served as a Brighton alderman for 43 years and became mayor of the then town from 1949 to 1950.https://www.mybrightonandhove.org.uk/topics/corporation-and- council/corporation-and-council-11 In summer 1920 Harry toured nationwide in The Rogues, a concert party. The following year Harry and Kathleen toured in a revue/musical called The Girl. While in Plymouth they married at the parish church in Tormoham, Devon on 17 February 1921. As well as being a performer, Kathleen was an astute businesswoman and thereafter did much to develop her husband's career. She suggested that he should change his name to Max Miller. Later a press notice described Max as the Cheeky Chappie, and the nickname stuck. Max and Kathleen formed a double act for a while but it became obvious to her that Max was the stronger performer and that he would be better as a solo act. =On the road to stardom= Through the '20s, he was regularly touring in revues. In 1922 he was in a show presented by the Sydney Syndicate, There You Are Then. In 1923 he toured with the Ernest Binn Arcadians. 1924 saw him joining a revue called Crisps. But during that summer he returned to Jack Sheppard's Concert Party on the Brighton seafront. In 1925 he continued in the revue Crisps and in November joined the cast of Ten to One On which starred Jimmy James. This show ran until February 1926 when he got work in variety or cine-variety, the latter a show half film and half live acts. In September he was booked in the Holborn Empire, his first engagement there, where he was spotted by impresario Tom Arnold who booked him to star in his next revue, Piccadilly. It opened in Birmingham and toured the country. His co-star was the 21-year-old Florence Desmond. After that he was booked by Fred Karno to appear in The Show and in May joined a touring cabaret revue called XYZ to the end of the year. After a few weeks in variety, he was back in revue starring in Francis Laider's Tipperary Tim. This kept him busy until February 1929 when he appointed a new agent, Julius Darewski. This was a turning point in his career. In May he made his first appearance at the London Palladium in variety. He returned there in October and, in November, joined the cast of Fools in Paradise which took him to March 1930. This would be his last revue for some time. Miller much preferred to perform solo, and from 1930 onwards, he appeared in variety in various large theatres including the London Palladium and the Holborn Empire. In those days instant success was unheard of, and Miller, like any other performer, had to earn his fame through a long apprenticeship. In May 1931 he appeared in his first Royal Variety Performance. Radio broadcasts followed. In 1932 he made his first recording, Confessions of a Cheeky Chappie, on the Broadcast Twelve Records label. After this initial success, he was wooed by HMV and made a number of records for them. In 1953 he changed to Philips and then to Pye. Miller was given a cameo role in the film The Good Companions. In it he played the part of a music publisher selling a song to a pianist, played by John Gielgud. Although he was not credited for his role, his three-minute debut was impressive, got him noticed and led to his making a further 13 films working up from small parts to starring roles. Considered his best film, Educated Evans (1936), which was based on an Edgar Wallace story and filmed by Warner Bros., has been lost. His last but one film was Hoots Mon! (1940). He played the part of a southern English comedian called Harry Hawkins. In the film there is a scene in which Harry Hawkins appears on the stage in a variety theatre. The act is Miller's, and the sequence is the only one in existence giving us an idea of his stage act. It is invariably included in any documentary made about him. =Stardom= Commemorative plaque at 160 Marine Parade, Brighton (2006) Miller's act on a variety bill usually lasted between 20 and 30 minutes. It would begin with the orchestra playing his signature tune, Mary from the Dairy. A spotlight aimed on the curtain by the wings would anticipate his appearance. There would be excitement in the audience. He would sometimes wait for up to 10 seconds until he appeared leading to resounding applause, walk to the microphone and just stand there in his costume, a gloriously colourful suit with plus-fours, a kipper tie, trilby and co-respondent shoes and wait for the laughter to begin. Although Miller's material was risqu√©, he never swore on stage and disapproved of those who did. He used double entendre and when telling a joke would often leave out the last word or words for the audience to complete. His act would be punctuated by songs, sentimental songs like My Old Mum or comic songs such as Twin Sisters. Sometimes he would accompany himself on guitar or entertain with a soft shoe shuffle. He wrote and co-wrote a number of songs. He was very much a southern English comedian. He preferred being booked in theatres in London or the south, so he could return to his beloved Brighton after a show. But in 1932 he embarked on his only overseas tour, when he sailed to Cape Town to appear in Johannesburg and Pretoria, South Africa.Balmoral Castle Passenger List: date of departure 22 April 1932 (The National Archives) After a number of years as a solo act in variety, he appeared in George Black‚Äôs wartime revue Haw Haw! at the Holborn Empire from December 1939 to July 1940. George Black's next revue Apple Sauce opened in August 1940 at the Holborn Empire co-starring Vera Lynn. After the theatre was bombed, the show transferred to the London Palladium where it ran until November 1941. After that Miller was back touring in variety and broke all records as the highest paid variety artist, earning ¬£1,025 in a single week at the Coventry Hippodrome in February, 1943. In 1947, he topped the bill in Bernard Delfont presents International Variety at the London Casino. In his review of the show, Lionel Hale, theatre critic of the Daily Mail, described Miller as the \\"Gold of the music hall\\".Daily Mail, 28 October 1947 =The comeback= Miller appeared in three Royal Variety Performances (1931, 1937 and 1950). In the last he was annoyed that he was only given six minutes while the American comedian Jack Benny got 20 minutes, so he abandoned his script and went on for 12 minutes ending with riotous applause. But this had a devastating effect on the schedule. Val Parnell, the producer, was furious and told Miller that he would never work for him again. However, after 18 months of Miller's touring in secondary theatres, he was invited back to the \\"number ones\\", the Moss Empires and returned in triumph to the London Palladium. This revitalised his career and with it came a new recording contract, this time with Philips. He was back on radio and appeared on television, but his television appearances were never a great success. The new medium did not suit his style; he needed the feedback only a live theatre audience could give him and the freedom to use his naughty material. Miller appeared regularly in all the large variety halls in and around London, the Hackney Empire, Chelsea Palace, Chiswick, Finsbury Park and Wood Green Empires, Metropolitan Music Hall and it was in the latter he recorded the LP, Max at the MetMax at the Met: Nixa NPT 19026 in 1957. =The final years= Tablet on wall of Garden of Remembrance, Downs Crematorium, Brighton In 1958 Miller suffered a heart attack. After recovery he needed to take life easier. His last West End appearance took place at the Palace Theatre in April 1959 and the last ever in variety in Folkestone in December 1960. He continued to make records, his last in January 1963 with Lonnie Donegan.The Market Song and Tit Bits: Pye 7N 15493 He diedTimes Obituary, 9 May 1963 on 7 May 1963 in his home and was cremated in the Downs Crematorium, Brighton. A memorial tablet is mounted on a wall in the Garden of Remembrance. His wife Kathleen outlived him by nine years, dying in a Hove nursing home in 1972. With dwindling work in variety, brought about by the increasing popularity of television, he commented, \\"When I'm dead and gone, the game's finished.\\" It has frequently been suggested that John Osborne modelled the character Archie Rice in his play The Entertainer on Miller. John Osborne denied it and in his autobiography he wrote, \\"This is not so. Archie was a man. Max was a god, a saloon-bar Priapus\\". Censorship The laws on censorship were strict during Miller's lifetime. Those responsible for censorship were the Lord Chamberlain in London and local watch committees in the provinces. Miller's material needed approval by those bodies but by using innuendo,Beyond a Joke Richard A Baker leaving out the last word or words of a joke, he could get away with much risqu√© and saucy material. However, he never swore or told a 'dirty joke' on stage. In one of his acts he would take from his pocket two books, one a white book and the other a blue book, explaining to the audience that these are joke books and asking them which the audience would like; the crowd almost always chose the blue book. The jokes in the ‚Äòblue book‚Äô were the naughty ones. For example: > I went skating the other week with a young lady on ice and we'd been going > around for quite a while and she kept on falling down. > I said, ‚ÄúHave you hurt yourself?‚Äù > She said, ‚ÄúNo, I'm sorry to spoil your fun.‚Äù > I said, ‚ÄúYou're not spoiling my fun. It'll keep on ice.‚ÄùThat's Nice Maxie: > Pye LP #NPL18064 (1961) Or he would leave the last word out for the audience to finish and blamed them if they laughed. > When roses are red, > They're ready for plucking. > When a girl is sixteen, > She's ready for ... ‚ÄôEre He would then say, \\"I know exactly what you are saying to yourself, you're wrong, I know what you're saying. You wicked lot. You're the sort of people that get me a bad name!\\" It was said that Miller was banned by the BBC twice, first in the 1930sDaily Express,p.23, 30 September 1936. and then in the 1950s. But these rumours only helped Miller's reputation as daring and naughty, and led to increased box office sales. Legacy Miller influenced many comedians during his lifetime and since. His jokes live on and are often told by other comedians. The late comedian Walter William Bygraves became known as \\"Max Bygraves\\" after his impersonation of Miller. Miller is also featured on the cover of the Beatles' \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\". The biography, Max Miller the Cheeky Chappie by John M. East was published in 1977. A paperback version was issued in 1993 with additional material. Two paperbacks containing Miller's jokes have been published: The Max Miller Blue Book compiled by Barry Took and illustrated by cartoonist Trog (1975) and The Max Miller Appreciation Society's Blue Book compiled by members with a foreword by Roy Hudd (2001). Several radio and television documentaries have been produced including Gerald Scarfe‚Äôs The Girls Who Do (40 Minutes, BBC, 1989) and Heroes of Comedy: Max Miller (1994). Here's a Funny Thing a play featuring John Bardon by R.W. Shakespeare which had been staged at the Edinburgh Fringe and at the Fortune Theatre in London was broadcast on Channel Four in November 1982 In 1999 the Max Miller Appreciation Society was formed in Brighton. Its main purpose is to keep his memory alive. It has erected a bronze statue sculptured by Peter Webster in the Royal Pavilion Gardens, New Road, Brighton (unveiled 1 May 2005; re-sited August 2007) and mounted two blue plaques on his former homes on Ashcroft in Kingston Lane, Shoreham-by-Sea (2000) and at 160 Marine Parade, Brighton (2006). In 2009 the Society curated an exhibition devoted to Miller's life and career in Bardsley's Fish Restaurant, Baker Street, Brighton.

Mix appeared in 291 films, all but nine of which were silent movies. He was Hollywood's first Western star and helped define the genre as it emerged in the early days of the cinema.  Early years  Thomas Hezikiah Mix was born January 6, 1880, in Mix Run, Pennsylvania, about north of State College, Pennsylvania, to Edwin Elias Mix and Elizabeth Heistand. He grew up in nearby DuBois, Pennsylvania, where his father, a stable master for a wealthy lumber merchant, taught him to ride and love horses. He spent time working on a local farm owned by John DuBois, a lumber businessman. He had dreams of being in the circus and was rumored to have been caught by his parents practicing knife-throwing tricks against a wall, using his sister as an assistant. In April 1898, during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, he enlisted in the Army under the name Thomas E. (Edwin) Mix. His unit never went overseas, and Mix later failed to return for duty after an extended furlough when he married Grace I. Allin on July 18, 1902. Mix was listed as AWOL on November 4, 1902, but was never court-martialed nor apparently even discharged. His marriage to Allin was annulled after one year. In 1905, Mix married Kitty Jewel Perinne, but this marriage also ended within a year. He next married Olive Stokes on January 10, 1909, in Medora, North Dakota. On July 13, 1912, Olive gave birth to their daughter Ruth. In 1905, Mix rode in President Theodore Roosevelt's inaugural parade with a group of 50 horsemen led by Seth Bullock, which included several former Rough Riders. Years later, Hollywood publicists muddled this event to imply that Mix had been a Rough Rider himself. Mix went to Oklahoma and lived in Guthrie, working as a bartender and other odd jobs. He was briefly night marshal of Dewey, Oklahoma, in 1911. He eventually found employment at the Miller Brothers 101 Ranch, one of the largest ranching businesses in the United States, covering , hence its name. The ranch had its own touring Wild West show in which Mix appeared. He stood out as a skilled horseman and expert shot, winning national riding and roping contests at Prescott, Arizona, in 1909, and Canon City, Colorado, in 1910.  Film career  = Selig Polyscope = right Mix began his film career as a supporting cast member with the Selig Polyscope Company. His first appearance was in a short film, The Cowboy Millionaire, released on October 21, 1909. In 1910, he appeared as himself in a short documentary film, Ranch Life in the Great Southwest, in which he displayed his skills as a cattle wrangler. Shot at the Selig studio in the Edendale district of Los Angeles (now known as Silver Lake), the film was a success, and Mix became an early motion picture star. Mix performed in more than 100 films for Selig, many of which were filmed in Las Vegas, New Mexico. While with Selig he co-starred in several films with Victoria Forde, and they fell in love. He divorced Olive Stokes in 1917. By then, Selig Polyscope had encountered severe financial difficulties, and Mix and Forde both subsequently signed with Fox Film Corporation, which had leased the Edendale studio. They married in 1918 and had a daughter, Thomasina (Tommie) Mix, in February 1922. = Mixville = Mix made more than 160 cowboy films throughout the 1920s. These featured action-oriented scripts contrasted with the documentary style of his work with Selig. Heroes and villains were sharply defined and a clean-cut cowboy always saved the day. Millions of American children grew up watching his films on Saturday afternoons. His intelligent and handsome horse, known as \\"Tony the Wonder Horse\\", also became a celebrity. Mix did his own stunts and was frequently injured. In 1913, Mix moved his family to a ranch he purchased in Prescott called Bar Circle A Ranch. He spent a lot of time at the ranch when taking a break from filming. A number of the movies were actually filmed in the Prescott home. During this time, Mix had success in the local Prescott Frontier Days rodeo, which lays claim to being the \\"world's oldest rodeo.\\" In 1920, he took first prize in a bull-riding contest. Today, his Bar Circle A Ranch developed into a planned community called Yavapai Hills where there is still a street named Bar Circle A Road. right Mix's salary at Fox reached $7,500 a week. Gossip columnist Louella Parsons wrote that he had his initials in electric lights on the top of his house. His performances were noted for their realism and for screen-friendly action stunts and horseback riding, attention-grabbing cowboy costumes, and showmanship. At the Edendale lot, Mix built a shooting set called Mixville. Loaded with western props and furnishings, it has been described as a \\"complete frontier town, with a dusty street, hitching rails, a saloon, jail, bank, doctor's office, surveyor's office, and the simple frame houses typical of the early Western era.\\" Near the back of the lot an Indian village of lodges was ringed by miniature plaster mountains which were said to be, on screen, \\"ferociously convincing\\". The set also included a simulated desert, a large corral, and (to facilitate interior shots) a ranch house with no roof. Mix played hard-to-get, threatening to move to Argentina to make films or to join the circus, but eventually he signed with FBO, although he then left the studio for Universal after salary disputes with FBO studio head Joseph P. Kennedy. He said of Kennedy that he was a \\"tight-assed, money-crazed son-of-a-bitch\\". In 1929, Mix was a pallbearer at the funeral of Wyatt Earp. = 1930s = Mix appeared with the Sells-Floto Circus in 1929, 1930, and 1931 at a reported weekly salary of $20,000 (). He and Forde divorced in 1931. Meanwhile, the Great Depression (along with the actor's free-spending ways and many wives) reportedly had wiped out most of his savings. In 1932, he married his fifth wife, Mabel Hubbell Ward. Universal Pictures approached him that year with an offer to perform in \\"talkies,\\" which included script and cast approval. He acted in nine films for Universal, but because of injuries he received while filming, he was reluctant to do any more. Mix then appeared with the Sam B. Dill circus, which he reportedly bought two years later (1935). Mix's last screen appearance was a 15-episode sound Mascot Pictures serial, The Miracle Rider (1935); he received $40,000 for the four weeks of filming. Outdoor action sequences for the production were filmed primarily on the Iverson Movie Ranch in Chatsworth, California, on the outskirts of Los Angeles. The site was known for its huge sandstone boulders, and one of them later became known as Tom Mix Rock when it was discovered it had been used in The Miracle Rider. In one episode, Mix was filmed descending from the top of the rock, with boot holes carved into it to assist him in making the descent. The rock and the boot holes, although unmarked, is in the Garden of the Gods park in Chatsworth. Also in 1935, Texas governor James Allred named Mix an honorary Texas Ranger. Mix returned to circus performing, now with his eldest daughter Ruth, who appeared in some of his films. In 1938, he went to Europe on a promotional trip, leaving Ruth behind to manage the circus. Without him, however, the circus soon failed, and he later excluded her from his will. Mix had reportedly made over $6 million (equivalent to $ million in ) during his 26-year film career.  Radio  Postcard sent in response to an entry for a radio program contest in 1941 In 1933, Ralston Purina obtained his permission to produce the radio series Tom Mix Ralston Straight Shooters, which, but for one year during World War II, was popular throughout most of the 1930s through the early 1950s, well after Mix's death. Mix never appeared on these broadcasts (his voice, damaged by a bullet to the throat and repeated broken noses, was not fit for radio) and was instead played by radio actors: Artells Dickson (early 1930s), Jack Holden (from 1937), Russell Thorsen (early 1940s) and Joe \\"Curley\\" Bradley (from 1944). Others in the supporting cast included George Gobel, Harold Peary and Willard Waterman. The Ralston company offered ads during the radio program for listeners to send in for a series of 12 special Ralston‚ÄìTom Mix comic books available only by writing the Ralston Company by mail. Most of Mix's radio work has been lost over the years; recordings of only approximately 30 scattered episodes, and no complete story arcs, survive.  Death  Mix memorial near Florence, Arizona (), the site of his death On October 12, 1940, after visiting Pima County Sheriff Ed Echols in Tucson, Arizona, Mix headed north towards Phoenix on U.S. Highway 80 (now Arizona State Route 79), driving his 1937 Cord 812 Phaeton. He stopped to call his agent at the Oracle Junction Inn, a popular gambling and drinking establishment, then continued toward Phoenix. About eighteen miles south of Florence, Mix came upon construction barriers at a bridge washed away by a flash flood. Unable to stop in time, his car swerved twice, then overturned in a gully. A large aluminum suitcase containing money, traveler's checks, and jewels, situated on the package shelf behind his head, hurtled forward and struck him, breaking his neck. He was 60 years old. His funeral took place at the Little Church of the Flowers in Glendale, California, on October 16, 1940, and was attended by thousands of fans and Hollywood personalities. He was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery. A small stone memorial marks the site of his death on State Route 79, and the nearby gully is known as \\"Tom Mix Wash\\". The marker bears the inscription: \\"In memory of Tom Mix, whose spirit left his body on this spot and whose characterization and portrayals in life served to better fix memories of the old West in the minds of living men.\\"  Legacy  Portrait in aspen tree of Tom Mix, dated 1936. Known as \\"arborglyphs\\", such carvings were made by young Basque and Irish American shepherds. (Santa Fe National Forest, R√≠o Arriba County, New Mexico) Tom Mix was the acknowledged \\"King of Cowboys\\" when Ronald Reagan and John Wayne were young, and the influence of his screen persona can be seen in their approach to portraying cowboys. When an injury caused football player Marion Morrison (later known as John Wayne) to drop out of the University of Southern California, Mix helped him find work moving props in the back lot of Fox Studios. That was the beginning of Wayne's Hollywood career. Mix made 291 movies throughout his career. As of 2007, only about 10% of these were known to be available for viewing, though it is unclear how many are now considered lost films. The 1937 Fox vault fire lost most of the archive of his films made with Fox. Mix memorial plaque For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Mix has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1708 Vine Street. His cowboy boot prints, palm prints and the hoof prints of his horse, Tony, are at Grauman's Chinese Theatre, at 6925 Hollywood Boulevard. In 1958 Mix was inducted posthumously into the Western Performers Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. In 1959, a \\"Monument to the Stars\\" was erected on Beverly Drive (where it intersects Olympic Boulevard and becomes Beverwil) in Beverly Hills. The memorial consists of a bronze-green spiral of sprocketed \\"camera film\\" above a multi- sided tower, embossed with full-length likenesses of early stars who appeared in famous silent movies. Those memorialized include Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, Will Rogers, Conrad Nagel, Rudolph Valentino, Fred Niblo, Harold Lloyd, and Mix. There is also a Tom Mix museum in Dewey, Oklahoma.Oklahoma Historical Society. \\"Tom Mix Museum\\" Additionally, from 1986‚Äì2002 there existed another museum in his birthplace of Mix Run, Pennsylvania. Between 1980 and 2004, 21 Tom Mix festivals were held during the month of September, most of them in DuBois, Pennsylvania.  Comic book appearances  Tom Mix Western, Fawcett Comics, August 1949. Artwork by Norman Saunders. Tom Mix was often portrayed in comic books, primarily during the heyday of Western-themed comics, the 1940s and 1950s. He was first featured in 11 issues of Dell Comics' The Comics from 1937 to 1938. The Ralston Purina Company, a sponsor of the radio series, produced nine issues of Tom Mix Comics in 1940‚Äì1941, and three issues of Tom Mix Commandos Comics in 1942. The 36-page comics were available by mail order, for two boxtops of any Ralston cereal. Fawcett Comics published 61 issues of Tom Mix Western from 1948 to 1953. Comics featuring Tom Mix were also published in Sweden, Germany, Canada, Australia, and Great Britain, including L. Miller & Son's Tom Mix Western Comics, which ran 85 issues from 1948 to 1951.  Cultural references  Mix with fourth wife, actress Victoria Forde, c. 1926 By the 21st century, people were more familiar with Mix's name through the many cultural references which have echoed long after his death than from his films. * Bruce Willis played Tom Mix in the 1988 Blake Edwards film Sunset, with James Garner as Wyatt Earp. The film was very loosely based on the fact that Earp and Mix knew each other when Earp was serving as a consultant during the silent film era. * Daryl Ponicsan's novel Tom Mix Died for Your Sins (1975) evokes Mix's life and personality. * Clifford Irving offered a pseudo-autobiographical version of Mix's early adulthood, drawing him as a brash young gringo who befriends and then joins up with the Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa in the novel Tom Mix and Pancho Villa (1982). * In the 1998 film Smoke Signals, the Native protagonists Victor and Thomas have their seats taken by two white men. They then discuss how the cowboys always win. They discuss Tom Mix and John Wayne, and wind up singing a song about John Wayne's teeth, and how they are never visible in his movies. * A resurrected Mix appeared in two of Philip Jos√© Farmer's Riverworld novels, The Dark Design (1977) and The Magic Labyrinth (1980), as a traveling companion of Jack London, along with a short story featured in the anthology Riverworld and Other Stories (1979). * The ghost of Tom Mix haunted a Hollywood couple in the supernatural thriller The Ghosts of Edendale (2004). * The United States Postal Service has commemorated Mix on a first-class mail postage stamp. * In the 2008 Clint Eastwood film Changeling, the \\"imposter\\" son of Angelina Jolie's character cites meeting and riding Tom Mix's horse as his motive for concocting his false story. * In the 2010 Boardwalk Empire episode \\"The Emerald City\\", Nucky Thompson's servant Eddie Kessler offers to frisk someone who's come to see him. Nucky chides him: \\"You're Tom Mix all of a sudden?\\" * In the 2014 Netflix show Peaky Blinders (TV series) Season 2, Episode 3, Tommy Shelby interviews a prospective fall guy for his gang who is partial to homemade western garb and asks \\"Spend a lotta time at the pictures eh? Cowboy pictures, Tom Mix, Yeah?\\" * The American artist Robert Ecker has incorporated Mix's trademark ten-gallon hat and his image in several works, including End of an Era (mezzotint, 1982) and Persistence of Imagery #25 (painting, 2013). * In the season five episode entitled \\"Mulcahy's War\\" of the television series M*A*S*H, Father Mulcahy performs an emergency tracheotomy on an injured soldier with his Tom Mix pocketknife. * An image of Mix appears prominently on the cover of the Beatles' 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. * In the film Tombstone, starring Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer, during the closing credits reference is made to the fact that \\"Tom Mix wept\\" at Wyatt Earp's funeral. * A passing reference is made about Mix in Season 3, Episode 2 of Downton Abbey. * In the first episode of The Beverly Hillbillies, Jed Clampett mentions that he likes Tom Mix.

It is used by monopolists to discourage entry into a market, and is illegal in many countries.Paul Milgrom and John Roberts, 1982. \\"Limit Pricing and Entry under Incomplete Information: An Equilibrium Analysis,\\" Econometrica, 50(2). pp. 443-459. The quantity produced by the incumbent firm to act as a deterrent to entry is usually larger than would be optimal for a monopolist, but might still produce higher economic profits than would be earned under perfect competition. The problem with limit pricing as strategic behavior is that once the entrant has entered the market, the quantity used as a threat to deter entry is no longer the incumbent firm's best response. This means that for limit pricing to be an effective deterrent to entry, the threat must in some way be made credible. A way to achieve this is for the incumbent firm to constrain itself to produce a certain quantity whether entry occurs or not. An example of this would be if the firm signed a union contract to employ a certain (high) level of labor for a long period of time.Dennis W. Carlton and Jeffery M. Perloff, 2004. Modern Industrial Organization, 4th edition, Description. Another example is to build excess production capacity as a commitment device. It is important to note that due to the often ambiguous nature of cost in production, it may be relatively easy for a firm to avoid legal difficulties when undertaking such action. Due to this ambiguous nature, limit pricing may well be a commonly used strategy even in modern economies. However, it is often very hard to regulate, since limit pricing is often synonymous with a market monopoly. When a monopoly exists, it becomes very difficult to compare alternative prices with other, similar firms to confirm claims that limit pricing may be occurring. Simple example In a simple case, suppose industry demand for good X at market price P is given by: \\\\mathsf{Q^D} = a - bP Suppose there are two potential producers of good X, Firm A, and Firm B. Firm A has no fixed costs and constant marginal cost equal to c > 0 . Firm B also has no fixed costs, and has constant marginal cost equal to gc, where g > 1 (so that Firm B's marginal cost is greater than Firm A's). Suppose Firm A acts as a monopolist. The profit-maximizing monopoly price charged by Firm A is then: p^M = \\\\frac{a + cb}{2b} Since Firm B will never sell below its marginal cost, as long as p^M \\\\le gc, Firm B will not enter the market when Firm A charges p^M. That is, the market for good X is an effective monopoly if: g \\\\ge \\\\frac{a + cb}{2cb} Suppose, on the contrary, that: g < \\\\frac{a + cb}{2cb} In this case, if Firm A charges p^M, Firm B has an incentive to enter the market, since it can sell a positive quantity of good X at a price above its marginal cost, and therefore make positive profits. In order to prevent Firm B from having an incentive to enter the market, Firm A must set its price no greater than gc. To maximize its profits subject to this constraint, Firm A sets price p^L = gc (the limit price).

It is comparable in many respects to the European Union's NESSIE project and to the Advanced Encryption Standard process run by National Institute of Standards and Technology in the U.S..  Comparison with NESSIE  There is some overlap, and some conflict, between the NESSIE selections and the CRYPTREC draft recommendations. Both efforts include some of the best cryptographers in the world therefore conflicts in their selections and recommendations should be examined with care. For instance, CRYPTREC recommends several 64 bit block ciphers while NESSIE selected none, but CRYPTREC was obliged by its terms of reference to take into account existing standards and practices, while NESSIE was not. Similar differences in terms of reference account for CRYPTREC recommending at least one stream cipher, RC4, while the NESSIE report specifically said that it was notable that they had not selected any of those considered. RC4 is widely used in the SSL/TLS protocols; nevertheless, CRYPTREC recommended that it only be used with 128-bit keys. Essentially the same consideration led to CRYPTREC's inclusion of 160-bit message digest algorithms, despite their suggestion that they be avoided in new system designs. Also, CRYPTREC was unusually careful to examine variants and modifications of the techniques, or at least to discuss their care in doing so; this resulted in particularly detailed recommendations regarding them.  Background and sponsors  CRYPTREC includes members from Japanese academia, industry, and government. It was started in May 2000 by combining efforts from several agencies who were investigating methods and techniques for implementing 'e-Government' in Japan. Presently, it is sponsored by *the Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry, *the Ministry of Public Management, Home Affairs and Post and Telecommunications, *the Telecommunications Advancement Organization, and *the Information-Technology Promotion Agency.  Responsibilities  It is also the organization that provides technical evaluation and recommendations concerning regulations that implement Japanese laws. Examples include the Electronic Signatures and Certification Services (Law 102 of FY2000, taking effect as from April 2001), the Basic Law on the Formulation of an Advanced Information and Telecommunications Network Society of 2000 (Law 144 of FY2000), and the Public Individual Certification Law of December 2002. Furthermore, CRYPTEC has responsibilities with regard to the Japanese contribution to the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC27 standardization effort.  Selection  In the first release in 2003, many Japanese ciphers were selected for the \\"e-Government Recommended Ciphers List\\": CIPHERUNICORN-E (NEC), Hierocrypt-L1 (Toshiba), and MISTY1 (Mitsubishi Electric) as 64 bit block ciphers, Camellia (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, Mitsubishi Electric), CIPHERUNICORN-A (NEC), Hierocrypt-3 (Toshiba), and SC2000 (Fujitsu) as 128 bit block ciphers, and finally MUGI and MULTI-S01 (Hitachi) as stream ciphers. In the revised release of 2013, the list was divided into three: \\"e-Government Recommended Ciphers List\\", \\"Candidate Recommended Ciphers List\\", and \\"Monitored Ciphers List\\". Most of the Japanese ciphers listed in the previous list (except for Camellia) have moved from the \\"Recommended Ciphers List\\" to the \\"Candidate Recommended Ciphers List\\". There were several new proposals, such as CLEFIA (Sony) as a 128 bit block cipher as well as KCipher-2 (KDDI) and Enocoro-128v2 (Hitachi) as stream ciphers. However, only KCipher-2 has been listed on the \\"e-Government Recommended Ciphers List\\". The reason why most Japanese ciphers have not been selected as \\"Recommended Ciphers\\" is not that these ciphers are necessarily unsafe, but that these ciphers are not widely used in commercial products, open-source projects, governmental systems, or international standards. There is the possibility that ciphers listed on \\"Candidate Recommended Ciphers List\\" will be moved to the \\"e-Government Recommended Ciphers List\\" when they are utilized more widely. In addition, 128 bit RC4 and SHA-1 are listed on \\"Monitored Ciphers List\\". These are unsafe and only permitted to remain compatible with old systems.

It is the first game in the Wave Race series. The game is relatively simple, in that the player controls a jet skier around a track aiming to beat the computer or up to three friends using the link cable accessory. Gameplay There are two modes in which the game may be played: ;Slalom: The goal is to race through pairs of posts across the track. Each one passed through increases the player's score by one point. The player with the most points once all posts have been taken wins. ;Race: A race in which the player must proceed through certain checkpoints and complete each lap in a time limit. Two powerups are available on the track. The dolphin gives the player increased turning ability, while the octopus allows the recipient to steal from opponents. In both modes, there are a variety of obstacles including ramps, shallow water and whirlpools. There are eight tracks for each mode. The game includes sixteen courses. The tracks have obstacles (buoys, pylons) and jumps. Players begin at a slower class of watercraft and graduate to faster engines. Players can also use a limited turbo boost. The game features four-player multiplayer. Reception Wave Race holds a score of 74% on GameRankings.http://www.gamerankings.com/gameboy/563303-wave-race/index.html Nintendo Power wrote that the game successfully emulated the feel of watercraft racing. The reviewers praised the effect of skidding around corners, and recommended the four-player multiplayer experience. Sequels Wave Race sold well enough to earn a Player's Choice medal. It was later followed by two sequels: Wave Race 64 and Wave Race: Blue Storm. Unlike the first game, Wave Race 64 and Wave Race: Blue Storm were also released in Japan. In November 2016, Nintendo applied to renew the Wave Race copyright through EUIPO, hinting that the series may continue in the near future. During an interview with Fandom in April 2018, Wave Race producer Shinya Takahashi suggested that the series may see a revival on the Nintendo Switch.

The activity was commenced on 12 April 1926 when the first Lithuanian radio sounds were broadcast from Kaunas radio station. TV programmes broadcasting services were launched on 30 April 1957. The Telecentras is state-owned stock company falling under supervision of the Ministry of Transport and Communications.  Activity  Telecentras maintains the major radio and TV programmes broadcasting networks in Lithuania which include both terrestrial people analogue and digital people broadcasting (DVB-T). In 2006, the company began to use TV programs compact standard MPEG-4 AVC/H.264. The introduction of this standard allowed broadcasting of 10 enhanced digital TV programmes through one DVB-T network. Furthermore, this standard provides the possibility to broadcast TV programmes of high definition, too. The Telecentras is the member of global WiMAX Forum. In 2009, the Telecentras was the first company in the European Union which started to provide Internet services using 4G Mobile WiMAX network. From 2012 October 29 the Telecentras broadcasts TV programmes just through DVB-T network.  Services  With the advanced communications technologies the company will not ensure radio and TV programmes broadcasting to all residents of Lithuania, as well as provides data transmission, network connection, telephony and other services. The company has been providing ‚ÄúErdvƒós‚Äù wireless internet services since 2001, 4G MEZON WiMAX mobile internet since 2009 and 4G LTE mobile internet since 2015. The Telecentras owns the highest building in the country: Vilnius TV Tower (326.5 m). Facilities mounted inside and outside TV tower transmit radio and TV signals and data for provision of internet and other services.

It was designed by the architect Sir Norman Foster and by the Spanish civil engineers Julio Mart√≠nez Calz√≥n and Manuel Juli√† Vilardell. This emblematic tower was built in 1991 by the construction company Cubiertas y MZOV S.A. for the 1992 Summer Olympics. It features a pod for floor space like many towers but uses guy wires for lateral support like a mast. Mainly used as a TV and radio transmitter, this futuristic design provides the highest viewpoint over the city. The top antenna reaches 288.4 m (946 ft) and the top of the pod, which has thirteen floors, reaches 152 m (499 ft). The highest point of this tower is the highest place one could be in the city of Barcelona. The tenth floor of the pod is open to the public. Events The tower has a space for event organisations, composed by a reception room and an observation desk set 560 metres above sea level. Construction The tower has a hollow slip-formed, reinforced concrete main shaft of only 4.5 m diameter, which reduces to a mere 3 m to hold a radio mast which telescopes from 2.7 m to 0.7 m. The thirteen floors are surrounded by a perimeter of open stainless steel grilles and suspended from the shaft by three primary vertical steel trusses. The total weight of the tower is 3,000 tons. A large number of cables keep the tower upright: *The lower guys are composed three series of 180 parallel strand cables (15 mm diameter) made from pre-tensioned high-strength steel with a polyethylene covering, each; *The upper guys are made of three series of 7 aramid fibre cables in parallel (56 mm diameter), each terminated with a resin socket.Torre de Collserola The three upper cables have a combined breaking strength of 4,200 tons.

From 1965 to 1973 he was a film and television critic for The Observer and lectured on art history, with an emphasis on surrealism.Jazz singer George Melly dies, The Telegraph, 5 July 2007 Early life and career He was born in Liverpool, Lancashire. His mother Maud was Jewish.https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/jul/06/guardianobituaries.obituaries He was educated at Stowe School, where he discovered his interest in modern art, jazz, and blues, and started coming to terms with his sexuality. He was the cousin of the philanthropist Emma Georgina Holt, of Sudley House, Liverpool. Melly was an atheist. Interviewed by Nigel Farndale, Melly said: \\"I don't understand people panicking about death. It's inevitable. I'm an atheist; you'd think it would make it worse, but it doesn't. I've done quite a lot in the world, not necessarily of great significance, but I have done it.\\"The Daily Telegraph, October 24, 2005, Features section, p. 023. Interest in surrealist art Melly once stated that he may have been drawn to surrealism by a particular experience he had during his teenage years. A frequent visitor to Liverpool's Sefton Park near his home, he often entered its tropical Palm House and there chatted to wounded soldiers from a nearby military hospital. It was the incongruity of this sight, men smoking among the exotic plants, dressed in their hospital uniforms and usually missing a limb, that he felt he later recognised in the work of the Surrealists. He joined the Royal Navy at the end of the Second World War because, as he quipped to the recruiting officer, the uniforms were \\"so much nicer\\". As he related in his autobiography Rum, Bum and Concertina, he was crestfallen to discover that he would not be sent to a ship and was thus denied the \\"bell-bottom\\" uniform he desired.Douglas Martin, \\"George Melly, 80, Jazz Singer With Flair for Extravagance, Is Dead\\" (obituary), The New York Times, 6 July 2007. Instead he received desk duty and wore the other Navy uniform, described as \\"the dreaded fore-and-aft\\". Later, however, he did see ship duty. He never saw combat, but was almost court-martialled for distributing anarchist literature. \\"George Melly\\", The Scotsman, 6 July 2007. Post-war life and career After the war, Melly found work in a London surrealist gallery, working with E. L. T. Mesens and eventually drifted into the world of jazz, finding work with Mick Mulligan's Magnolia Jazz Band. This was a time (1948 onwards) when New Orleans and \\"New Orleans Revival\\" style jazz were very popular in Britain. In January 1963, the British music magazine NME reported that the biggest trad jazz event to be staged in Britain had taken place at Alexandra Palace. The event included Alex Welsh, Diz Disley, Acker Bilk, Chris Barber, Kenny Ball, Ken Colyer, Monty Sunshine, Bob Wallis, Bruce Turner, Mick Mulligan and Melly. He retired from jazz in the early 1960s when he became a film critic for The Observer and a writer on the Daily Mails satirical newspaper strip Flook, illustrated by Trog. He was also scriptwriter on the 1967 satirical film Smashing Time. This period of his life is described in Owning Up. He returned to jazz in the early 1970s with John Chilton's Feetwarmers, a partnership that ended in 2003. He later sang with Digby Fairweather's band. He released six albums in the 1970s including Nuts in 1972 and Son of Nuts the next year.McGregor, Andrew, George Melly, \\"Nuts\\" and \\"Son of Nuts\\", BBC Review, 21 June 2007. He wrote a light column, Mellymobile, in Punch magazine describing their tours. He was an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society and a Distinguished Supporter of the British Humanist Association. Melly was President of the BHA 1972‚Äì4, and was also an Honorary Associate of the Rationalist Association. He was also a member of the Max Miller Appreciation Society and on 1 May 2005 joined Roy Hudd, Norman Wisdom, and others in unveiling a statue of Miller in Brighton. His singing style, particularly for the blues, was strongly influenced by his idol, Bessie Smith. While many British musicians of the time treated jazz and blues with almost religious solemnity, Melly rejoiced in their more bawdy side, and this was reflected in his choice of songs and exuberant stage performances. He recorded a track called \\"Old Codger\\" with The Stranglers in 1978, which was especially written for him by the band. Melly, who was bisexual, moved from strictly homosexual relationships in his teens and twenties to largely heterosexual relationships from his thirties onwards.Lynn Barber, \\"George and I were drunk with sex\\", The Observer, 17 July 2005. He married twice and had a child from each marriage, though his first child Pandora was not known to be his until she was much older. He married his second wife, Diana Moynihan (n√©e Dawson), in 1963 and they lived on Gloucester Crescent in Camden Town. She brought with her two children (Candy and Patrick) from two previous marriages. Patrick died from a heroin overdose in his twenties. Their own son, Tom, was born two days after the wedding. Diana published an autobiography in 2005 of their life and (open) marriage together. The two participated in a televised celebrity couples quiz in the 1970s. Asked separately what made them decide to marry, Diana announced \\"I was pregnant!\\" and George, in his turn, merely said, \\"The less said about that, the better.\\" Brecon George and Diana Melly had a country retreat, the Tower, at Scethrog in the Brecon Beacons, between 1971 and 1999. This was somewhere Melly could escape the jazz world and indulge his love of fishing on the River Usk. However, jazz followed him to Wales and this led to a series of celebrated performances in the area and in the South Wales valleys. In 1984 the Brecon Jazz Festival was conceived by a group of jazz enthusiasts who gained widespread support from the local community. Melly was the first musician to be contracted for the opening festival and remained a supporter until his death. He was a factor in the festival's success and served as its President in 1991. As well as being the President of the Contemporary Arts Society for Wales, Melly was a contemporary art collector. His passion for surrealist art continued throughout his life and he lectured and wrote extensively on the subject. His passion for fly-fishing never dwindled and in later life he sold several important paintings (by Magritte and Picasso) to enable him to buy a mile of the River Usk. In 2000 he published Hooked!, a book on fly-fishing. Later years Melly was still active in music, journalism, and lecturing on surrealism and other aspects of modern art until his death, despite worsening health problems such as vascular dementia,\\"Singer Melly has early dementia\\", BBC News, 27 February 2007. incipient emphysema, and lung cancer.Melly, Tom, \\"Truths, half-truths, and wikipedia\\", The Register, 15 March 2007. His encouragement and support to gallery owner Michael Budd led to a posthumous exhibition for the modern abstract artist Fran√ßois Lanzi.Correspondence dated 30 April 1992 to 13 July 1992. In addition to age-related health problems, Melly suffered from environmental hearing loss because of long-term exposure to on-stage sound systems, and his hearing in both ears became increasingly poor. Despite these problems, however, Melly would often joke that he found some parts of his ailing health to be enjoyable. He often equated his dementia to a quite amusing LSD trip, and took a lot of pleasure from his deafness, which he said made many boring conversations more interesting. On Sunday 10 June 2007, Melly made an appearance, announced as his last ever performance, at the 100 Club in London. This was on the occasion of a fund-raising event to benefit the charity supporting his carers. He died at his London home of lung cancer and emphysema (which he had for the last two years of his life) aged 80 on 5 July 2007. His humanist funeral was held at the West London Crematorium, in Kensal Green. The hearse was led by a jazz band, including Kenny Ball on trumpet, playing a New Orleans funeral march. His cardboard coffin was covered with old snapshots and cartoons of Melly by his friends, as well as hand-drawn decorations.\\"Melly farewell is all that jazz (and no blues)\\", London Evening Standard, 13 July 2007. On 17 February 2008 BBC Two broadcast George Melly's Last Stand (produced by Walker George Films), an intimate portrayal of Melly's last months. His sister Andr√©e Melly was an actress, who lived in Ibiza with her husband, Oscar Quitak. In 2018, writer, musician and filmmaker Chris Wade (known for his music project Dodson and Fogg) made a documentary about Melly entitled The Certainty of Hazard, featuring his wife Diana, son Tom and various friends and associates.

Watie, was a leader of the Cherokee Nation. The nation allied with the Confederacy, and he was the only Native American to attain a general's rank in the Civil War, Confederacy or Union. He commanded the Confederate Indian cavalry of the Army of the Trans-Mississippi, made up mostly of Cherokee, Muskogee and Seminole. He was the last Confederate general in the field to cease hostilities at war's end. Before removal of the Cherokee to Indian Territory in the late 1830s, Watie and his older brother Elias Boudinot were among Cherokee leaders who signed the Treaty of New Echota in 1835. The majority of the tribe opposed their action. In 1839, the brothers were attacked in an assassination attempt, as were other relatives active in the Treaty Party. All but Stand Watie were killed. Watie in 1842 killed one of his uncle's attackers, and in 1845 his brother Thomas Watie was killed in retaliation, in a continuing cycle of violence that reached Indian Territory. Watie was acquitted by the Cherokee at trial in the 1850s on the grounds of self-defense. During the Civil War and soon after, Watie served as Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation (1862‚Äì1866). Watie led the Southern Cherokee delegation to Washington, D.C. after the war to sue for peace, hoping to have tribal divisions recognized. The US government negotiated only with the leaders who had sided with the Union. It recognized former chief John Ross as principal chief in 1866, under a new treaty. Watie stayed out of politics for his last years, and tried to rebuild his plantation.  Early life  Watie was born in Oothcaloga, Cherokee Nation (now Calhoun, Georgia) on 12 December 1806, the son of Uwatie (Cherokee for \\"the ancient one\\", sometimes spelled Oowatie), a full-blood Cherokee, and Susanna Reese, daughter of a white father and Cherokee mother. He was named Degataga. According to one biography, this name means \\"standing firm\\" when translated to English.Dale, Edward E. Chronicles of Oklahoma, \\"Some Letters of General Stand Watie.\\" Volume 1, Number 1, January 1921. Retrieved December 24, 2012. He loosely translated his name as simply \\"Stand\\" and combined it with his father‚Äôs name to get Stand Watie. Kenny A. Franks, \\"Stand Watie.\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. Watie's brothers were Gallagina, nicknamed \\"Buck\\" (who later took the name Elias Boudinot); and Thomas Watie. They were close to their paternal uncle Major Ridge, and his son John Ridge, both later leaders in the tribe. By 1827, their father David Uwatie had become a wealthy planter, who held African-American slaves as laborers. After Uwatie converted to Christianity with the Moravians, he took the name of David Uwatie; he and Susanna renamed Degataga as Isaac. In his life, Degataga preferred to use a form of the English translation of his Cherokee name, \\"Stand Firm.\\" Later, the family dropped the \\"U\\" from the spelling of their surname, using \\"Watie.\\" Along with his two brothers and sisters, Stand Watie learned to read and write English at the Moravian mission school in Spring Place, Cherokee Nation (now Georgia).  Adult life  Stand Watie occasionally helped write articles for the Cherokee Phoenix newspaper, for which his older brother Elias served as editor from 1828‚Äì1832. The first Native American newspaper, the Phoenix published articles in both Cherokee and English. Watie became involved in the dispute over Georgia's repressive anti-Indian laws. After gold was discovered on Cherokee lands in northern Georgia, thousands of white settlers encroached on Indian lands. There was continuing conflict, and Congress passed the 1830 Indian Removal Act, to relocate all Indians from the Southeast to lands west of the Mississippi River. In 1832, Georgia confiscated most of the Cherokee land, despite federal laws to protect Native Americans from state actions. The state sent militia to destroy the offices and press of the Cherokee Phoenix, which had published articles against Indian Removal. Believing that removal was inevitable, the Watie brothers favored securing Cherokee rights by treaty before relocating to Indian Territory. They were among the Treaty Party leaders who signed the 1835 Treaty of New Echota. The majority of the Cherokee opposed removal, and the Tribal Council and Chief John Ross, of the National Party, refused to ratify the treaty. One source states that Stand Watie married four women: Eleanor Looney, Elizabeth Fields, Isabella Hicks, and Sarah Caroline Bell. His child with Elizabeth Fields was stillborn in 1836. Watie and Sarah Bell married in 1842. They had three sons and two daughters, but there were no grandchildren.  Early years in Indian Territory  In 1835, Watie, his family, and many other Cherokee emigrated to Indian Territory (eastern present-day Oklahoma). They joined some Cherokee who had relocated as early as the 1820s and were known as the \\"Old Settlers\\".Lowery, Charles D. \\"The Great Migration to the Mississippi Territory, 1798‚Äì1819,\\" Journal of Mississippi History. 1968 30(3): 173‚Äì192 Those Cherokee who remained on tribal lands in the East were rounded up and forcibly removed by the U.S. government in 1838.Frank, Andrew K.

After removal, members of the Cherokee government carried out sentences against Treaty Party men for execution; their giving up tribal lands was a \\"blood\\" or capital offense under Cherokee law. Stand Watie, his brother Elias Boudinot, their uncle Major Ridge and cousin John Ridge, along with several other Treaty Party men, were all sentenced to death on 22 June 1839; only Stand Watie survived. He arranged for his brother Elias' children to be sent for their safety and education to their mother's family in Connecticut; their mother Harriet had died in 1836 before the migration. In 1842, Watie encountered James Foreman, whom he recognized as one of his uncle's executioners, and killed him. This was part of the post-Removal violence within the tribe, which was close to civil war for years. Ross supporters executed Stand's brother Thomas Watie in 1845.Southern Cherokee Nation. \\"Early History of the Southern Cherokee.\\" Retrieved July 14, 2013. In the 1850s, Stand Watie was tried in Arkansas for the murder of Foreman; he was acquitted on the grounds of self-defense. His nephew Elias Cornelius Boudinot, who had returned to the West and become a lawyer, defended him. Watie, a slave holder, developed a successful plantation on Spavinaw Creek in the Indian Territory. He served on the Cherokee Council from 1845 to 1861, and served as Speaker from 1857 to 1859.Anderson, Mabel Washbourne, \\"General Stand Watie.\\" Chronicles of Oklahoma, Volume10, Number 4. December 1932. Accessed January 27, 2016. After John Ross fled to Federal-controlled territory in 1862, Watie replaced Ross as principal chief.  Civil War service  The Cherokee Braves flag, as flown by Stand Watie's troop Watie was the only Native American to rise to a brigadier general's rank in the Confederacy during the war. Fearful of the Federal Government and the threat to create a State (Oklahoma) out of most of what was then the semi-sovereign \\"Indian Territory\\", a majority of the Cherokee Nation initially voted to support the Confederacy in the American Civil War for pragmatic reasons, though less than a tenth of the Cherokee owned slaves. Watie organized a regiment of cavalry. In October 1861, he was commissioned as colonel in what would become the 1st Cherokee Mounted Rifles. Although Watie fought Federal troops, he also led his men in fighting between factions of the Cherokee and in attacks on Cherokee civilians and farms, as well as against the Creek, Seminole and others in Indian Territory who chose to support the Union. Watie is noted for his role in the Battle of Pea Ridge, Arkansas, on March 6‚Äì8, 1862. Under the overall command of General Benjamin McCulloch, Watie's troops captured Union artillery positions and covered the retreat of Confederate forces from the battlefield after the Union took control. However, most of the Cherokees who had joined Colonel John Drew's regiment defected to the Union Side. Drew, a nephew of Chief Ross, remained loyal to the Confederacy. In August 1862, after John Ross and his followers announced their support for the Union and went to Fort Leavenworth, the remaining Southern Confederate minority faction elected Stand Watie as principal chief. After Cherokee support for the Confederacy sharply declined, Watie continued to lead the remnant of his cavalry. He was promoted to brigadier general by General Samuel Bell Maxey on 10 May 1864, though he did not receive word of his promotion until after he led the ambush of the steamboat J. R. Williams on 16 July 1864.Civil War in the Indian Territory. Cottrell, Steve. Pelican Books, pp. 94‚Äì95. Retrieved September 7, 2014. Watie commanded the First Indian Brigade of the Army of the Trans-Mississippi, composed of two regiments of Mounted Rifles and three battalions of Cherokee, Seminole and Osage infantry. These troops were based south of the Canadian River, and periodically crossed the river into Union territory. They fought in a number of battles and skirmishes in the western Confederate states, including the Indian Territory, Arkansas, Missouri, Kansas, and Texas. Watie's force reportedly fought in more battles west of the Mississippi River than any other unit. Watie took part in what is considered to be the greatest (and most famous) Confederate victory in Indian Territory, the Second Battle of Cabin Creek, which took place in what is now Mayes County, Oklahoma on 19 September 1864. He and General Richard Montgomery Gano led a raid that captured a Federal wagon train and netted approximately $1 million worth of wagons, mules, commissary supplies, and other needed items. Stand Watie's forces massacred black haycutters at Wagoner, Oklahoma during this raid. Union reports said that Watie's Indian cavalry \\"killed all the Negroes they could find\\", including wounded men.Allardice, Bruce S. (2008) Kentuckians in Gray, p. 101, University Press of Kentucky. . Since most Cherokee were now Union supporters, during the war, General Watie's family and other Confederate Cherokee took refuge in Rusk and Smith counties of east Texas.Oklahoma Historical Society, John Bartlett Meserve, Chronicles of Oklahoma, Vol. 15, no.1, March 1937, pp. 57‚Äì59.

The Cherokee and allied warriors became a potent Confederate fighting force that kept Union troops out of southern Indian Territory and large parts of north Texas throughout the war, but spent most of their time attacking other Cherokee. The Confederate Army put Watie in command of the Indian Division of Indian Territory in February 1865. By then, however, the Confederates were no longer able to fight in the territory effectively. On 23 June 1865, at Doaksville in the Choctaw Nation (now Oklahoma), Watie signed a cease-fire agreement with Union representatives for his command, the First Indian Brigade of the Army of the Trans-Mississippi. He was the last Confederate general in the field to surrender.Stand Watie bio, Civil War HomeBrigadier General Stand Watie, WBTS in Indian Territory In September 1865, after his demobilization, Watie went to Texas to see his wife Sallie and to mourn the death of their son, Comisky, who had died at age 15.\\"Stand Watie's Last Battle.\\" Grand Lake Business Journal.

Tribal leadership and death Historical Marker in Polson Cemetery John Ross had signed an alliance with the Confederacy in 1861 in order to avoid disunity within his tribe and among the Indian Territory Indians. Within less than a year, Ross and part of the National Council concluded that the agreement had proved disastrous. In the summer of 1862, Ross removed the tribal records to Union-held Kansas and then proceeded to Washington to meet with President Lincoln. After Ross' departure, Tom Pegg took over as principal chief of the pro-Union Cherokee.Sturme, Circe. \\"Blood Politics, Racial Classification, and Cherokee National Identity\\", American Indian Quarterly, Vol. 22, No. 1/2 (Winter/Spring 1998)(stable url ), accessed September 6, 2011. Following Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863, Pegg called a special session of the Cherokee National Council. On 18 February 1863, it passed a resolution to emancipate all slaves within the boundaries of the Cherokee Nation. After many Cherokee fled north to Kansas or south to Texas for safety, pro-Confederates took advantage of the instability and elected Stand Watie principal chief. Ross' supporters refused to recognize the validity of the election. Open warfare broke out between Confederate and Union Cherokee within Indian Territory, the damage heightened by brigands with no allegiance at all.Warde, When the Wolf Came: The Civil War and Indian Territory (2013), chapters 3‚Äì6. After the Civil War ended, both factions sent delegations to Washington, D.C. Watie pushed for recognition of a separate \\"Southern Cherokee Nation\\", but never achieved that. The U.S. government, recognizing that the two factions would never agree on common terms, decided to negotiate with them separately and play them against each other. By doing so, it was able to extract a number of concessions from both sides. The resulting treaty required the Cherokee to free their slaves. The Southern Cherokee wanted the government to pay to relocate the Cherokee Freedmen from their lands. The Northern Cherokee suggested adopting them into the tribe, but wanted the federal government to give the Freedman an exclusive piece of associated territory. The federal government required that the Cherokee Freedmen would receive full rights for citizenship, land, and annuities as the Cherokee. It assigned them land in the Canadian addition. This treaty was signed by Ross on 19 July 1866, and ratified by the U.S. Senate on 27 July, four days before Ross' death. The tribe was strongly divided over the treaty issues and a new chief was elected, Lewis Downing, a full-blood and compromise candidate. He was a shrewd and politically savvy Principal Chief, bringing about reconciliation and reunification among the Cherokee. Tensions lingered into the 20th century, but the Cherokee did not have that occurred in the South.Dale, Edward Everet, and Gaston Litton. Cherokee Cavaliers, pp. 229‚Äì234 & 263‚Äì266. (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1939) . After the treaty signing, Watie had gone into exile in the Choctaw Nation. Shortly after Downing's election, he returned to the Cherokee. Watie tried to stay out of politics and rebuild his fortunes. He returned to Honey Creek, where he died on 9 September 1871. Watie was buried in the old Ridge Cemetery, later called Polson's Cemetery, in what is now Delaware County, Oklahoma, on 9 September 1871 as a citizen of the Cherokee Nation. Family After moving to Indian Territory, Stand Watie married Sarah Bell on September 18, 1842. Their families had been long-time friends. They had three sons: Saladin, Solon and Cumiska, and two daughters, Minnee and Jacqueline. Saladin died while the family was living at Mount Tabor / Bellview, Texas (the home of his in-laws the Bells) in 1868, while Solon died during the following year.

Their main product line is a Lotus Seven inspired car - vehicles originally designed by Colin Chapman with only the bare essentials for motoring in order to give the rawest and most exhilarating driving experience. History Whilst Caterham Cars bought the rights from Lotus Cars, Chris Smith set up a rival company and manufactured kits with very similar styling and construction. This led Caterham to threaten litigation (based on Industrial design rights) in the late 1980s which was eventually settled out of court and resulted in Westfield improving and changing the design of their cars. Whilst externally sharing a common look, Westfield and Caterham cars are somewhat different in construction. Westfield prefers to employ the same glass fibre body method that Lotus has traditionally used for their other models such as the Elise, Esprit, and Elan, rather than the aluminium used by Caterham. Westfield has also pioneered technical innovations such as Independent rear suspension and a wider chassis, which other manufacturers have since adopted. The company has recently introduced a version of its SEi kit that uses donor parts from the Mazda Mx5 Miata. This is generally called an SDV (Single Donor Vehicle) kit. There is also an SDV kit that uses a Ford Sierra as a donor. The wide range of drivetrain configurations available to Westfield customers now includes the Honda S2000 engine and gearbox as part of the company's MegaS2000 kit and cars. According to figures given to the magazine Total Kit Car, Westfield produces about 450 SEi and XTR chassis each year. In the first series of BBC's Top Gear, a Westfield XTR2 driven by the black Stig set a faster lap time than the reigning record holder of that series, the Pagani Zonda. In December 2006, Westfield became a part of Potenza Sports Cars Limited.Autoindustry news item on sale to Potenza In December 2007, it was announced that GTM Cars also became a part of Potenza Sports Cars.

Although Watts-Russell and John Fryer were the only two official members, the band's recorded output featured a large rotating cast of supporting artists, many of whom were otherwise associated with 4AD, including members of Cocteau Twins, Pixies, and Dead Can Dance. The project became known for its gothic, dream pop sound, and released three full albums beginning in 1984 with It'll End in Tears. Background Watts-Russell had founded 4AD in 1980, and the label established itself as one of the key labels in the British post-punk movement. Following several releases, Watts-Russell developed the idea of collaborating under the name This Mortal Coil. The name is taken from the Monty Python's Flying Circus \\"Dead Parrot sketch\\",Morning Becomes Eclectic interview with Ivo Watts- Russell, 13 March 1998 which in turn is a quote from Shakespeare's Hamlet (\\"... what dreams may come, when we have shuffled off this mortal coil...\\"). Quoting the 4AD website: One of the label's earliest signings was Modern English. In 1983, Watts-Russell suggested that the band re-record two of its earliest songs, \\"Sixteen Days\\" and \\"Gathering Dust\\", as a medley. At the time, the band was closing its set with this medley, and Watts-Russell felt it was strong enough to warrant a re-recording. When the band rebuffed the idea, Watts-Russell decided to assemble a group of musicians to record the medley: Elizabeth Fraser and Robin Guthrie of Cocteau Twins; Cindy Sharp of Cindytalk; and a few members of Modern English. An EP, Sixteen Days/Gathering Dust, resulted from these sessions. A cover of Tim Buckley's \\"Song to the Siren\\", performed by Fraser and Guthrie alone, was recorded as a B-side for the EP. Pleased with the results, Watts-Russell decided to make this the A-side of the 7\\" single version of the EP, and the song quickly became an underground hit, leading Watts-Russell to pursue the recording of a full album under the This Mortal Coil moniker, 1984's It'll End in Tears. In June 1998, Watts-Russell began releasing albums in a similar vein to his TMC projects, under the name The Hope Blister.

It operated a portfolio of falling price shopping television channels to over 12 million homes in the UK. History On 1 April 2009, it was announced that Sit-Up Ltd had been sold by Virgin Media to Aurelius AG. The purchase price or terms of the agreement have not been disclosed. Virgin Media had previously owned the company\\"Virgin sells off shopping channels\\", by James Welsh, Digital Spy, January 4, 2009. Retrieved January 28, 2020. ‚Äì this followed partial ownership prior to May 2005. Bid Shopping ran the channels Bid and Price Drop each day from 7:45am through to 1:30am. The channels were designed to sell consumer products via digital TV (currently carried by digital satellite, cable, and terrestrial) or the Internet. On 1 August 2011, 'Sit-Up' was renamed 'Bid Shopping', with 'Bid TV', 'Price-Drop TV' and 'Speed Auction TV' becoming 'Bid', 'Price Drop' and 'Speed Auction' respectively. On 21 May 2013, it was announced that the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) had referred Sit-Up Limited to Ofcom for consideration of statutory sanctions following repeated breaches of the UK Code of Broadcast Advertising. Ofcom has confirmed that it has accepted the referral. Since January 2012, there have been 33 ASA rulings against Sit-Up Ltd. The two main types of problem have been misleading pricing claims and misleading product descriptions. In December 2013, the struggling Bid Shopping group was taken over by former Corporate Restructuring Lawyer Bryan Green; the channel posted pre-tax losses of ¬£7.4m in 2011 and a 10% fall in sales. In February 2014, it was revealed Bid Shopping had debts of ¬£68m and was looking to enter a voluntary agreement with its creditors to keep the company going. On 10 March 2014, Bid was rebranded as 'Shop at Bid' and took on a more traditional shopping channel look with the premium rate number replaced with a number costing 20p per minute, it also appears the channel is no longer having auctions and has gone for a traditional sell and buy format. On 17 April 2014, Bid Shopping was put into administration; Shop at Bid and its sister channel Price Drop were closed down with immediate effect with around 200 jobs being lost. On 18 February 2015, Grant Miller, through the company Bid Shopping Limited, acquired the intellectual property, patents, brands and domains of Sit-Up, which resulted in Sit-Up emerging from administration. The company is now working on re- launching the channel via online and selected TV broadcasting in the near future. Bid TV announced via Twitter it will relaunch as an online channel on 4 January 2016 first, then to relaunch on TV during later in the year but due to technical difficulties, they had to delay it again for the 3rd time. The Twitter page has since been left inactive after the tweet, The email for sit- up no longer exists. Channels In early January 2005, it was announced that Sit-Up would launch two free-to-air movie channels called Real-movies.tv and Movies On 333. Real-movies.tv was to be female orientated with an emphasis on true stories, whilst Movies On 333 (intended for Sky Digital channel 333) would focus on western and niche films. However, another company would launch their own free-to-air movie channel just ahead of Sit-Up's in the 333 slot; True Movies was also female orientated with an emphasis on true stories. Sit- Up changed their original channel proposals, with Matinee Movies and Bad Movies emerging as their new channels (details below), which both launched on 25 April 2005. =Shop at Bid= Shop at Bid (formerly known as Bid-Up.TV until 21 January 2005, Bid TV until 1 August 2011, and Bid until 10 March 2014) was a television shopping channel. It was the first auction channel of its kind in the UK. The channel was launched on 5 October 2000. It started by broadcasting 12 hours a day, many of which were pre-recorded, with auction graphics overlaid so people could bid although the video itself was pre- recorded. It broadcast live for almost 18 hours a day from 07:45 to 01:30. Shop at Bid was available on Freeview channel 23, Virgin Media channel 745, Sky channel 645, Freesat channel 802, and WightFibre channel 704. It closed on 17 April 2014, because of Bid Shopping's closure. =Price Drop= Price Drop (formerly known as Price-Drop.TV until 21 January 2005 and as Price-Drop TV until 1 August 2011) was a television shopping channel that focuses on falling price auctions. Price Drop's channel format was the first of its type in the UK, using a falling price dynamic. The channel was launched on 11 June 2003, broadcasting live between 16:00 to midnight, Wednesdays to Saturdays. It broadcast live for almost 18 hours a day from 07:45 to 01:30. Price Drop was available on Freeview channel 37, Virgin Media channel 741, Sky channel 654, Freesat channel 801, and WightFibre channel 706. It closed on 17 April 2014, because of Bid Shopping's closure. =Bid Plus= Bid Plus (formerly known as Speed Auction TV until 1 August 2011 and Speed Auction until March 2013) was a channel launched on 27 July 2005 and closed on 1 July 2013. The channel launched as 'Speed Auction TV' featuring rising price auctions lasting around 4 minutes. However, from 26 March 2008, the channel \\"flipped the arrow\\" and started selling all its products using a falling price dynamic, matching its sister channels Bid and Price Drop. On 1 August 2011, the channel changed its name to 'Speed Auction' dropping the 'TV' from its name. The channel was later renamed again to Bid Plus in March 2013 and lasted until its closure a few months later. =Pricedropper.co.uk= Pricedropper.co.uk launched on 25 August 2010 and was Bid Shopping's online-only channel, which focuses on fixed-price 'auctions', which aim to beat the high street. Pricedropper.co.uk outlived its online sister channel Dibbing.com. In March 2013, the website got replaced by the official website for Bid Plus until the channel's closure. =Matinee Movies= Matinee Movies was a part-time movie channel owned by Sit-Up Ltd. It was then on Sky channel 336 and ran daily from 9 am to 9 pm. The last hour of the channel was occupied by some of Sit-Up's shopping auctions, such as Speed Auction TV. The channel was aimed at families, showing classic and rare black & white British films such as Love in Pawn and the Frankie Howerd bequest comedy A Touch of the Sun. Films on the channel were introduced by film critic Paul Ross. As an interlude, or at the start of the broadcast day, there were showings of a film magazine programme called Sprockets (not to be confused with the SNL sketches with Mike Myers). In under a year, the channel and EPG slot was sold to Dolphin Television who rebranded it as a 24-hour channel called Movies4Men on 1 February 2006. Sit-Up have no involvement with this channel. =Bad Movies= Bad Movies was a part-time movie channel owned by Sit-Up Ltd. It was then on Sky channel 339 and ran daily from 9 pm to 9 am. The first three hours however showed Sit-Up's shopping auctions, so Bad Movies content did not actually appear until midnight. The channel was aimed at a young adult audience, showing a variety of cinematic \\"turkeys\\", though some of the content was increasingly from matinee movies, especially after 5am. Films included Tomboy starring Betsy Russell, Glen and Randa, Plan 9 from Outer Space and Revenge of the Cheerleaders starring David Hasselhoff. The channel also featured introductions by Paul Ross and episodes of Sprockets. As per Matinee Movies, the channel and EPG slot was also sold to Dolphin Television who rebranded it as a 24-hour channel called ACTIONMAX (later rebranded as Movies4Men 2) on 1 February 2006. Sit-Up have no involvement with this channel. =Screenshop= Screenshop was an infomercial-based shopping channel. A deal in July 2004 meant that Vector Direct began to broadcast their presentations exclusively on the channel, this led to the channel being stripped of its identity. In 2005, it began to broadcast under Vector Direct's own band 'TV Warehouse'. A second channel, Screenshop 2, launched in 2008 and ran until 29 April 2012. It broadcast during Speed Auction's downtime of 01:30 to 07:30 each day on Sky channel 680. Screenshop also broadcast during the hours of 01:30 to 07:45 during Bid Shopping's downtime on its other channels, Bid and Price Drop.

Front T√∂√∂l√∂) and Taka-T√∂√∂l√∂ (; lit. Rear T√∂√∂l√∂). in Helsinki, Finland. The neighbourhoods are located next to the city centre, occupying the western side of the Helsinki Peninsula. Etu-T√∂√∂l√∂, the southern neighbourhood, borders Kamppi and is the location of the Finnish Parliament House. Taka-T√∂√∂l√∂, the northern neighbourhood, borders Meilahti and Laakso. Contrary to popular belief, T√∂√∂l√∂ is no longer an official name of any district or neighbourhood in Helsinki; in 1959 T√∂√∂l√∂ was divided into Etu- T√∂√∂l√∂ (; lit. Front T√∂√∂l√∂) and Taka-T√∂√∂l√∂ (; lit. Rear T√∂√∂l√∂). T√∂√∂l√∂ was built in 1920‚Äì1930 when Helsinki suffered from rapid population growth and needed more housing. It was the site of the first ever town planning competition in Finland in 1898‚Äì1900. Three entries were lifted out for recognition; first prize was awarded to architect Gustaf Nystr√∂m (together with engineer Herman Norrm√©n), second prize to architect Lars Sonck, and third prize to a joint entry by Sonck together with architects Bertil Jung and Valter Thom√©.Riitta Nikula, Focus on Finnish 20th Century Architecture and Town Planning. Helsinki, Helsinki University Press, 2006. Nystr√∂m's scheme represented classicism with wide main streets and imposing public buildings arranged in symmetrical axial compositions, and the other two extries following two picturesque theories of town planning proposed at that time by Viennese city planner Camillo Sitte, with the street network adapted to the rocky terrain and with picturesque compositions. Undecided what course of action to take, however, the City Council asked the prize-winners to submit new proposals. When this led to further stalemate Nystr√∂m and Sonck were commissioned to work together on the final plan combining Nystr√∂m's spacious street network and elements of Sonck's Sittesque details. The final plan (1916) under the direction of Jung, made the scheme more uniform, while the architecture is seen as typical of the Nordic Classicism style. A typical street in the plan is that of Museokatu, with tall lines of buildings in a classical style along a curving street line. A still wider (24 metres) new tree-lined boulevard was that of Helsinginkatu, driven through the working-class district of Kallio, first outlined in 1887 by Sonck, but with further input from Nystr√∂m, and completed in around 1923.Pekka Lehtinen, \\"The Boulevard of Helsinginkatu - A street project for an industrial city\\", Ptah, 1:2004, pp.55-63. However, despite these wide streets there are also several Sitte-inspired picturesque streets and squares, most notably Temppeliaukio square (in the centre of which is the \\"church in the rock\\"). T√∂√∂l√∂ has always been respected as a place to live and the prices of apartments are high, especially in Etu-T√∂√∂l√∂. T√∂√∂l√∂ is also known for its functionalist architecture, notably around Taka-T√∂√∂l√∂. There are many parks, including Hesperia Park on the T√∂√∂l√∂ Bay and also Sibelius Park, named after composer Jean Sibelius and containing a monument in his name. T√∂√∂l√∂ also has a vibrant cultural life, being the location of the Finnish National Opera, the National Museum of Finland, Kunsthalle Helsinki, the Zoological Museum, T√∂√∂l√∂ Library, and many small galleries and bookstores. With the Olympic Stadium, Sonera Stadium, the Sports Hall and the Ice Hall, all within walking distance from each other, Taka-T√∂√∂l√∂ is also a significant neighbourhood for sport life in Helsinki.

It was awarded to twelve cities of the Soviet Union. In addition, the Brest Fortress was awarded an equivalent title of Hero Fortress. This symbolic distinction for a city corresponds to the individual distinction Hero of the Soviet Union. According to the statute, the hero city was issued the Order of Lenin, the Gold Star medal, and the certificate of the heroic deed (gramota) from the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Also, the corresponding obelisk was installed in the city. History The usage of the term \\"hero city\\" is dated to articles in Pravda as early as in 1942. The first official usage of the title is dated by May 1, 1945, when Joseph Stalin issued his Supreme Commander Order #20 commanding to fire salutes in \\"hero cities Leningrad, Stalingrad, Sevastopol, and Odessa.\\" On June 22, 1961 (20th anniversary of the beginning of the Great Patriotic War) the term \\"Hero City\\" was applied to Kyiv in the ukases that awarded Kyiv the Order of Lenin and introduced the Medal \\"For the Defence of Kyiv\\". The statute of the title was officially introduced on May 8, 1965 by the ukase of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of USSR, on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the victory in the Great Patriotic War. The same day ukases were issued about awarding the cities mentioned above: Leningrad (Saint Petersburg), Volgograd (former Stalingrad), Kyiv, Sevastopol, and Odessa. However traditionally for these cities the anniversaries of being Hero City correspond to the dates mentioned earlier. Additionally, Moscow was declared Hero City and Brest declared Hero Fortress. Subsequent awards were issued as follows: *14 September 1973: Kerch and Novorossiysk. *26 June 1974: Minsk *7 December 1976: Tula *6 May 1985: Murmansk and Smolensk In 1988 the issuance of the award was officially discontinued. On April 5, 2005 the State Duma of Russian Federation passed the law in the first reading about the introduction of the honorary title \\"City of Military Glory\\" (–ì–æ—Ä–æ–¥ –≤–æ–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–π —Å–ª–∞–≤—ã). Potential candidates are places of fierce battles: Oryol, Rzhev, Yelnya, Voronezh, Vyazma, and others. Hero Cities list =Brest Fortress= Monument to the Brest Fortress The fortress in Brest, Belarus was awarded the title Hero Fortress in 1965. It was located right on the recently established border between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany drawn in the secret appendix to the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact. As such, the fortress had little warning when the Axis invaded on 22 June 1941, and became the site of the first major fighting between Soviet frontier guards and the invading German forces of Army Group Centre. German artillery heavily shelled the fortress; the subsequent attempt to quickly take it with infantry failed, however, and the Germans started a lengthy siege. The Brest garrison, although cut off from the outside world and having run out of food, water and ammunition, fought and counter-attacked until the very last minute. The Germans deployed tanks, tear gas and flame throwers. After the Germans had taken most of the ruined fortifications, taking heavy casualties, bloody fighting continued underground. The fighting ended only in late July. The actual front had by then already moved hundreds of kilometres further east. Even after the fortress was officially taken, the few surviving defenders continued to hide in the basements and to harass the Germans for several months. =Leningrad= Leningrad Hero City Obelisk The city of Leningrad, now known as Saint Petersburg, saw what is regarded as one of the greatest human tragedies of the entire war. Leningrad, one of the cities with a large amount of classical and baroque architecture on the Baltic Sea, was a city with a pre-war population of three million inhabitants. By August 1941, the Germans had reached the city's southern outskirts. Finnish forces had meanwhile recaptured the Karelian Isthmus northwest of the city, which they had lost after the Winter War in 1940. The city was completely cut off from all land access on 8 September 1941. As the Gulf of Finland was blocked as well, Leningrad's only contact with the outer world was a vulnerable waterway across Lake Ladoga (Road of Life), as Finnish command didn't agree to German requests to advance beyond the River Svir and to conquer the rest of the Lake's coastline. Since taking the city seemed too costly to the Germans, in the light of bitter Soviet resistance, they instead began the Siege of Leningrad in order to starve the city to death. Soon, electricity, water and heating for civilian housing had to be shut down. All public transportation stopped in 1941-42 winter, but in 1942 city tramcars were relaunched (trolleys and buses were inoperable until end of the war). Thousands of Leningrad citizens froze or starved to death in the first winter of the siege alone, dying at home in their beds or collapsing from exhaustion in the streets. Meanwhile, German artillery continued to bombard the city. Although the siege lasted for 872 days, the city did not surrender. When Lake Ladoga froze in the winter, the Road of Life was opened to the Soviet-held southern shore, with a long trail of trucks bringing food and supplies to the besieged city and evacuating citizens on their way back. Both the food and the civilian transports were constantly attacked by the Germans with artillery shelling and air raids. When Soviet forces eventually lifted the siege in January 1944, over one million inhabitants of Leningrad had died from starvation, exposure and German shelling. 300,000 soldiers had perished in the defence and relief of Leningrad. Leningrad was awarded the title Hero City in 1965, being the first city to receive that distinction. =Volgograd= Volgograd is the present-day name of the city of Stalingrad. The defence of Stalingrad from July to November 1942, the counter-offensive of 19 November 1942 that trapped the Axis forces in and around the ruined city, and the German surrender on 2 February 1943 marked the turning-point of the European Theatre of World War II. The intensity and sheer scale of the battle of Stalingrad illustrate the ferocity of the German-Soviet War. Heavy German bombardment, killing thousands of civilians, had turned the city into a landscape of ruins. Workers of the city's weapons factories started personally handing over arms and ammunition to the defending soldiers as the Germans closed in, and eventually continued the fight themselves. Ever more Soviet troops were shipped into the city across the Volga River under enemy fire. German superiority in tanks became useless in the rubble of urban warfare. Fierce man-to-man fighting in streets, buildings and staircases continued for months. The Red Army moved its strategic reserve from Moscow to the lower Volga, and transferred all available aircraft from the entire country to the Stalingrad area. The Germans eventually lost a quarter of their total forces deployed on the Eastern Front, and never fully recovered from the defeat. The total casualties on both sides are estimated at nearly 2 million, within a period of 200 days. Volgograd was awarded the title Hero City in 1965. =Odessa= Odessa commemorative stamp (USSR, 1965) In early August 1941, the Black Sea port of Odessa, located in present-day Ukraine, was attacked and besieged by Romanian forces fighting alongside their German allies. The fierce battle in defense of the city lasted until 16 October, when the remaining Soviet troops, as well as 15,000 civilians were evacuated by sea. Partisan fighting continued, however, in the city's catacombs. Odessa was awarded the title Hero City in 1965. =Sevastopol= Hero City monument at Sevastopol The Soviet Black Sea port of Sevastopol was a heavily defended fortress on the Crimean peninsula. German and Romanian troops had advanced to the outskirts of the city from the north and launched their attack on 30 October 1941. Having failed to take the city, Axis forces began a siege and heavy bombardment, with such unusual pieces of ordnance as the M√∂rser Karl self-propelled mortar, and the gigantic Schwerer Gustav railroad cannon. A second Axis offensive against the city, launched in December 1941, failed as well, as the Soviet army and navy forces continued to fight fiercely. Eventually the city was taken in June 1942. It was liberated in bloody fighting in May 1944. Sevastopol was awarded the title Hero City in 1965. =Moscow= Hero Cities Memorial in Moscow At the gates of the Soviet capital, the German invaders suffered their first defeat in 1941. The advance of the German Army Group Centre came to a halt in late November 1941, at the outskirts of Moscow itself. The Soviet Government had by then been evacuated, yet Joseph Stalin remained in the city. Struggling between determination and despair, the city's population helped build defensive positions in the streets. The underground metro stations provided shelter during German air raids. General Georgy Zhukov, who assumed command of the city's defence, largely left close combat tactics to the local commanders on the city's approaches, and focused on concentrating fresh troops from Siberia for an eventual counter-attack. The Soviet counter-offensive was launched on 5 and 6 December 1941. In the freezing cold of an unusually harsh winter, Soviet forces, including well-equipped ski battalions, drove the exhausted Germans back out of reach of Moscow and consolidated their positions on 7 January 1942. The victory in the battle provided an important boost in morale for the Soviet population. Moscow was awarded the title Hero City in 1965. =Kyiv= Hero City highway sign with the Communist star, Kyiv in 2010. Since 15 May 2015 Communist and Nazi symbols are prohibited in Ukraine.Poroshenko signed the laws about decomunization. Ukrayinska Pravda. 15 May 2015 Poroshenko signs laws on denouncing Communist, Nazi regimes, Interfax-Ukraine. 15 May 2015 The capital of present-day Ukraine became the site of the largest encirclement battle in the summer of 1941. When the Germans commenced their offensive on 7 July, Soviet forces concentrated in the Kyiv area were ordered to stand fast, and a breakout was prohibited. Defence of the pocket was fierce. Thousands of civilians volunteered to help defend the city. Eventually Kyiv was taken on 19 September. Over 600,000 Soviet soldiers were taken captive when the pocket was cleared. The prolonged resistance effectively disrupted the German plans of blitzkrieg. However, in military terms, the battle was a great victory for the German Army and a disaster for the Soviets. It had a huge effect on morale, and Adolf Hitler praised the victory as the greatest battle in history. During the German occupation of Kyiv, hundreds of thousands of civilians were killed or deported for forced labour. Kyiv again became a battlefield when advancing Soviet forces pushed the Germans back West, liberating the city on 6 November 1943. Kyiv was awarded the title Hero City in 1965. =Novorossiysk= The city of Novorossiysk on the eastern coast of the Black Sea provided a stronghold against the German summer offensive of 1942. Intense fighting in and around the city lasted from August until it was captured by the Germans in mid-September 1942. The Soviets however retained possession of the eastern part of the bay, which prevented the Germans from using the port for supply shipments. Novorossiysk was awarded the title Hero City in 1973. =Kerch= Kerch, a Russian port in the East of the Crimean peninsula, formed a bridgehead at the strait dividing Crimea from the Southern Russian mainland. After fierce fighting, it was taken by the Germans in November 1941. On 30 December 1941 the Soviets recaptured the city in a naval landing operation. In May 1942 the Germans occupied the city again, yet Soviet partisan forces held out in the cliffs near the city until October 1942. On 31 October 1943 another Soviet naval landing was launched. The largely ruined city was finally liberated on 11 April 1944. Kerch was awarded the title Hero City in 1973. =Minsk= The city of Minsk, capital of present-day Belarus, was encircled by advancing German forces in late June 1941. Trapped in a vast pocket, the Soviets defended their positions desperately. Their resistance was broken on 9 July, with over 300,000 Soviet soldiers taken captive. During the following three-year occupation, the Germans killed about 400,000 civilians in and around the city. The Minsk area became a centre for the Soviet partisan activity behind enemy lines. Minsk was awarded the title Hero City in 1974. =Tula= Tula, a historical Russian city with important military industry south of Moscow, became the target of a German offensive to break Soviet resistance in the Moscow area between 24 October and 5 December 1941. The heavily fortified city held out, however, and secured the Southern flank during the Soviet defence of Moscow and the subsequent counter-offensive. Tula was awarded the title Hero City in 1976. =Murmansk= The city of Murmansk, located on the Kola Peninsula close to the Norwegian and Finnish borders, was a strategically important sea port and industrial city. It was the only Soviet port on the northern coast that did not freeze in the winter, and was vital for the transport of supplies to the South. German forces, including 800 Finns under German command, launched an offensive against Murmansk on 29 June 1941. More than 180,000 grenades and inflammable shells were fired on the city itself. Fierce Soviet resistance in the tundra and several Soviet counter- attacks made an Axis breakthrough impossible, however. Axis forces discontinued their attacks in late October 1941, having failed to take Murmansk or to cut off the Karelian railway line. Murmansk was awarded the title Hero City in 1985. =Smolensk= Located on the approaches to Moscow, the city of Smolensk saw fierce fighting in the summer of 1941. German armoured divisions of Army Group Centre began an offensive on July 10, 1941 to encircle Soviet forces in the Smolensk area. Soviet resistance was strong, and several counter-attacks were conducted. The Soviets even managed to temporarily break the German encirclement and to evacuate troops out of the pocket. The battle ended in early September. The bitter fighting had considerably delayed the overall German advance toward Moscow, so that defence lines further east could be strengthened. Smolensk was awarded the title Hero City in 1985.

In the interview, he said that Baku getting the status of Hero City \\"would be quite fair\\" and that it \\"would be a respect to the people who lost their lives working day and night\\" along with being an \\"important socio- political act\\".https://azvision.az/amp/en/news/7197/news.html In an interview with Vestnik Kavkaza, historian Efim Pivovar recommended that the Russian Federation not assign the city this title and instead support an initiative through the Commonwealth of Independent States to award Baku, as well as cities like Tashkent, with this title.https://vestnikkavkaza.net/interviews/Efim-Pivovar-Mikhail-Mukhin-Baku- should-get-the-status-of-a-hero-city.html In January 2020, Russian Deputy Dmitry Savelyev became one of the first sitting members of parliament to publicly support this.https://www.turan.az/ext/news/2020/1/free/politics%20news/en/86592.htm Similar awards =In Russia= In 2005, Russia introduced a similar award titled \\"City of Military Glory\\". It has been awarded to 45 cities in Russia. In 2020, the title of \\"City of Labour Valour was established\\", honouring the cities who had a record of uninterrupted production of military and civilian products at industrial enterprises during the Second World War. 20 cities currently hold the title. =In breakaway pro-Russian republics= The breakaway Georgian republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia have hero cities in their nation, with those cities being given their title based on their perceived steadfast pushback against the Georgian military during their respective conflicts (War in Abkhazia from 1992 to 1993 and the Russo-Georgian War on 2008). In Abkhazia, the cities of Tkvarcheli and Gudauta were awarded the title of Hero of Abkhazia in with the status of a Hero City.

The decree on conferring the award was read at a ceremony dedicated to the Day of Courage and National Unity.https://south-ossetia.info/cxinval-gorod-geroj/ The Donetsk People's Republic awarded the title of Hero City (connected to the title of Hero of the Donetsk People's Republic) to the city of Donetsk in August 2017. =In other countries= A number of other countries also awarded their highest military decorations to cities or other territorial units in commemoration of events of World War II. The best-known example of this among the Allies is perhaps, in the British Empire, the George Cross that was awarded to the island of Malta in 1942. But also the Socialist Yugoslavian government awarded the Order of the People's Hero to eight separate cities of Yugoslavia, which then became known as \\"hero cities\\": Belgrade, Zagreb, Ljubljana, Novi Sad, Prilep, Pristina, Titov Drvar and Cetinje. Recently, after the Croatian War of Independence in 1991, the Croatian border city Vukovar was named Hero City because of damage to Vukovar during the siege 1991 has been called the worst in Europe since World War II, drawing comparisons with Stalingrad. The Republic of Cuba awards the title of Hero City to those cities with recognized military history, either in the 19th or 20th centuries. The most prominent example of these is the Hero City of Santiago de Cuba, awarded as such for its part in the Cuban War of Independence against the Spanish, the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and the Cuban Revolution. In Italy, a number of cities have been awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor. In Spain, during the First Carlist War the city of Zaragoza was awarded the title \\"Siempre Heroica\\" (always heroic) for the citizens' spontaneous defense of the city during the Cincomarzada. In Portugal, on Terceira Island in the Azores, its two municipalities were honoured by Maria II for their civilian bravery. Praia da Vit√≥ria (\\"The Beach of Victory\\") acquired its epithet from the Battle of Praia Bay and Angra likewise became Angra do Hero√≠smo or \\"Angra the Heroic\\" for the same victory. Surabaya can be considered Indonesia's equivalent to a Hero City, regarded as such because of the bravery of its residents during the 1945 Battle of Surabaya, the first ever major battle experienced by the young republic during the Indonesian War of Independence.

His Austrian princely title (from 1829) was actually spelled Wasa. Life and career After his birth, he was raised under the supervision of the royal governesses Hedvig Ulrika De la Gardie and Charlotte Stierneld in succession. When he was ten years old, his father was deposed by the Coup of 1809 and the family was forced into exile. The Gustavian party tried to get him accepted as crown prince in 1809 and 1810, but were unsuccessful. Queen Charlotte, wife of the new king, was one of the leading figures of the Gustavian Party, and often visited ex-queen Frederica in her house arrest and worked for prince Gustav to be acknowledged as heir to the throne. She wrote of this issue in her diaries: during a dinner, General Georg Adlersparre told her that Jean Baptiste Bernadotte had asked whether she had any issue, and was interested when he found she had not. She said that the throne already had an heir in the deposed King's son. Adlersparre became upset and expressed the opinion of his party that none of the instigators of the coup would accept this as they feared that the boy would take revenge against them when he became King, and that they would go as far as take up the old rumour that the deposed King was, in fact, illegitimate and the son of Queen Sophia Magdalena and Count Adolf Fredrik Munck af Fulkila to prevent this. (search for all versions on WorldCat) Between the time after the coup and before the royal family left Sweden, they were held under house arrest. During that period, Queen Charlotte described him in her famous diary as an obedient and dutiful child with a great ability to learn. He was not haughty as his younger sister Princess Sophie, but humble. Rather, he seemed too quiet and too careful for his age. When Princess Sophie asked him why their father was no longer King, he told her that it was best not to talk about it. He asked no questions and did not appear to miss his father. After he was told that his father had been deposed, he acted embarrassed towards his mother. However, when she told him that he too had lost his position as heir, he cried and embraced her without a word. The announcement gave him much relief and happiness. In 1816, he assumed the title of Count of Itterburg. He served as an officer to the Habsburgs of Austria, and in 1829, Emperor Francis I created him Prince of Vasa (). During the Greek War of Independence (1821-1829) there was some talk of Gustav becoming its first king, but this never materialized. He was made a Field Marshal- Lieutenant in the Austrian Army in 1836. Marriage and issue In 1828, he became engaged to Princess Marianne of the Netherlands, but political pressure forced an end to any wedding plans. On 9 November 1830, he married in Karlsruhe his first cousin Princess Louise Amelie of Baden (5 June 1811 in Schwetzingen ‚Äì 19 July 1854 in Karlsruhe). They divorced in 1843. A son, Louis, was born in 1832 but died shortly after birth. Their daughter, Princess Carola, married the Catholic King Albert I of Saxony, but they had no issue. Gustaf died on 5 August 1877. In 1884, his (and his infant son's) remains were moved to Stockholm, to be buried beside his father.

This is a clear case of form influencing content: these novels were published in episodes in newspapers and could in a certain sense be compared to modern soap opera.

Born into an aristocratic family, Weichs joined the Bavarian cavalry in 1900 and fought in the First World War. At the outbreak of the Second World War he commanded the XIII Corps in the invasion of Poland. He later commanded the 2nd Army during the invasions of France, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. In August 1942 during Case Blue, the German offensive in southern Russia, he was appointed commander of Army Group B. In 1944, Weichs commanded Army Group F in the Balkans overseeing the German retreat from Greece and most of Yugoslavia. During the Nuremberg Trials, Weichs was implicated in war crimes committed in the Balkans and was scheduled to take part in the US Army's Hostages Trial. He was removed from the proceeding for \\"medical reasons\\" without having been judged or sentenced. Early life and career =World War I= Born in 1881 into an aristocratic family, Maximilian von Weichs entered the Bavarian Cavalry in 1900 and participated in World War I as a staff officer. After the war he remained in the newly created Reichswehr where he worked at a number of General Staff positions. =Inter-war years= Milch, Keitel, Brauchitsch, Admiral Raeder and Weichs at the 1938 Nuremberg Rally Transferred from the 3rd Cavalry Division to command Germany's 1st Panzer Division upon its formation in October 1935, he led the unit in maneuvers that impressed Army Commander in Chief Werner von Fritsch. Weichs' aristocratic and cavalry credentials demonstrated the continuing influence of these military elites in Germany's modernizing force. In October 1937 he became the commander of the 13th Army Corps, that later served in the 1938 German annexation of the Sudetenland. World War II Weichs (third from left) with Johannes Blaskowitz (right, holding map) in Warsaw during the invasion of Poland, 1939 To prepare for the German invasion of Poland beginning World War II in 1939, Weichs was appointed head of his own Army Corps \\"Weichs\\". After the Polish surrender, he was made Commander-in-Chief of the 2nd Army, a part of Rundstedt's Army Group A in the West. After the Battle of France, he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and promoted to colonel-general. Leading his army, Weichs later took part in the Balkans Campaign, and in preparation for Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, he was assigned to lead the 2nd Army as a part of Fedor von Bock‚Äôs Army Group Centre. He led the 2nd Army in 1941 through the Battle of Kiev, the Battle of Smolensk, and then on to Vyazma and Bryansk. Gerd von Rundstedt with Weichs in France, June 1940 In 1942, for Fall Blau, Weichs was assigned to lead the newly created Army Group B. Army Group B was composed of Salmuth's 2nd Army, Hoth‚Äôs 4th Panzer Army, and Paulus's 6th Army. In addition to the German armies, Army Group B included the 2nd Hungarian Army, 8th Italian Army, the Third and the Fourth Romanian Armies. The 6th Army was assigned to take the city of Stalingrad and cover approximately 800 km of front. Weichs (right) in Russia during Case Blue, September 1942 The Soviet Operation Uranus broke through the Romanian armies on his flanks, cutting off the 6th Army inside Stalingrad. Suggesting retreat, Weichs fell out of Hitler‚Äôs favor. Consequently, parts of Army Group B were taken away from the command of Weichs and incorporated into a new \\"Army Group Don\\", led by Manstein. Later in February, the remaining part merged with the Don Group into a newly reinstated Army Group South, also led by Manstein. Weichs was relieved of command. Weichs was promoted to Field Marshal on 1 February 1943. In August 1943 Weichs was appointed Commander of Army Group F in the Balkans directing operations against local partisan groups. Since August 1943 Weichs was also OB S√ºdost, commander-in-chief of the German occupied Greece and the Balkans (Yugoslavia, Albania and Thrace) whose headquarters were first in Belgrade and since 5 October 1944 in Vukovar. In April 1944 Weichs was appointed to the position of commander of all German troops stationed in Hungary. In late 1944, he oversaw the German retreat from Greece and most of Yugoslavia. Weichs was retired on 25 March 1945 and was arrested by American troops in May. During the Nuremberg Trials, Weichs was said to be implicated in war crimes committed while suppressing the partisans. He was removed from the US Army's Hostages Trial for medical reasons without having been judged or sentenced.

The phonology of the name Caucones may be evidence that they originated in the Caucasus Mountains. Hittite tablets mention a kaz-kaz people who lived along the southern shore of the Black Sea ‚Äì where Homer's Iliad placed the Kauk√¥nes. According to Herodotus and other classical writers, the Caucones were displaced or absorbed by the Bithynians, who had migrated from Thrace. This suggests that the Bithynians spoke an Indo-European language, such as Thracian, while the Caucones did not. (The Bithynians also expelled or absorbed other autochthonous tribes, such as the Mysians, although one ‚Äì the Mariandyni ‚Äì maintained their cultural independence, in area that became north-east Bithynia. Strabo [12.3.3] states that in earlier times the Bithynians were known as Mysians. Herodotus [7.20, 75] says that some time before the Trojan War, the Mysians, alongside the Teucrians, invaded Thessaly.) The Caucones appear in the Iliad Book X, when the Trojan herald Dolon reveals the array of Trojan allies, ranged among their neighbors like a lesson in geography: \\"Towards the sea lie the Karians, and Paionians of the bent bow, and the Leleges and Caucones, and noble Pelasgians.\\" Caucones in Book XX were polemon meta th√¥r√™ssonto, \\"equipping themselves for war,\\" as allies of the Trojans, when in a lighter moment, the hero Aeneas fell into their midst, saved by Poseidon from certain death in direct combat with the mighty Greek hero Achilles. Aeneas moves west in time receiving honors from Vergil among the founders of the Roman Empire. Recognition of the Caucones as deserving a place in the Neleiad kingdom in southwestern Greece occurs in later epic. Efforts were made, we are told by Pausanias (4.1.5). to 'historicize' Kaukon as the early ancestor of the Athenian genos Lykomidai around 480 BC by inventing a grandson of an earth-born Phlyus named Kaukon who taught the Eleusinian Mysteries to a royal queen Messene. His name was Kaukon, a teacher of religious rites. In the Odyssey (3.366), Athena tells Nestor at Pylos in preparation for an ox sacrifice that she will secure the offering locally: \\"I'll go to the Caucones, where there's an old debt still owing me, not a small amount.\\" This allusion may refer to northern inhabitants in Elis, from Bouprasion to Dyme, that Strabo's evidence claimed were Caucones. Their penetration beyond Arkadia (Strabo 7.7.1‚Äì2) and their claims to be sons of Lycaon or Lycos (Apollodorus, Library 3.8.1) explains their enduring presence over time in literature. Pausanias' description of the carved figure of Caucon holding a lyre atop his tomb speaks to their tribal poetic literacy. Several scholars believed Pylian Caucones (Hdt. 4.148, 1.147, 5.65) brought Neleid legends and Nestor's polemic exhortations to Kolophon.T. W. Allen JHS 30 (1910) 302. Mimnermus (fr. 9, 14‚Äì15, Strabo 14.1.3-4) their ancestor extended the traditional royal \\"we\\" of Homeric Nestor in his words of inspiration to Smyrnaeans fighting Lydian Gyges in the Hermus plain (Paus. 4.21.2, quoted by Theoclus, Paus. 5.8.7, 9.29.4). The Abishemu obelisk, includes the words \\"Kwkwn ≈õ: Rwqq\\" translated as \\"Kukun, son of the Lycian\\" A Bronze Age titular figure of Kukunnis (KWKWN), son of Lycos (RWQQ), left an inscribed hieroglyphic obelisk, known as the \\"Abishemu obelisk\\", for the governor of Byblos; and, as ruler of Wilusa (Ilion), he was commanded in correspondence by Hittite Muwatalli II (father of Mursili III), to \\"adopt an heir\\" named Alaksandu for the throne.Wainwright JEA 47 (1967) 71 note 5; Albright BASOR 55 (1959) 33ff. Strabo (8.3.14‚Äì15) in discussing Triphylian Pylos lists Caucones once inhabiting Lepreion as does Pausanias (5.5.5), a settlement that may have had custody over Hades-Demeter shrines at Mt. Minthe that grew mint used for the kukei√¥n at Eleusis (Homer, Hymn to Demeter 209: gl√™kh√¥ni). These Caucones enter history with their expulsion (Hdt.4.148) and dispersion to Athens (Paus. 2.18.7‚Äì8, 7.2.1‚Äì5) and Ionian Miletos (Hdt. 1.146-7), after contributing to the spread of the Eleusinian Great Goddesses into Messenia and Thebes (Paus.4.1.5‚Äì9), Ephesos and Kolophon (Strabo 14.1.3). With these passages Pausanias affirms Herodotus (2.51) on the spread of Hermes and a cult of Kabeiroi throughout Attika under Hipparchus between 528‚Äì514 BC employing inscribed square-cut figures of Hermes in marble as road markers (Plato, Hipparchus 228b‚Äì229b). A Caucon priest Methapus had done much the same at Thebes. The Milesian Caucones, according to Herodotus (1.147), possessed ancestry from Pylian Codrus, son of Melanthos, the very same genealogy Herodotus (5.65) assigns to the Athenian tyrant Peisistratos. Strabo (12.3.5) reported Caucones once inhabiting the southern Black Sea coast from Heraclea Pontica (modern Karadeniz Ereƒüli) to Carambis promontory at Teion, on the Parthenios River, their likely Homeric geography (Iliad 20.328‚Äì9). The Caucones are not to be confused with the Cicones (also mentioned in the Iliad and the Odyssey) who were a Thracian tribe on the south coast of Thrace.LacusCurtius References Category:Ancient peoples of Anatolia Category:Greek mythology Category:Hellenistic-era tribes in the Balkans Category:Legendary tribes in Greco-Roman historiography Category:Ancient tribes in Greece ","title":"Caucones"},{"id":"549310","text":"Boronia is a genus of about 160 species of flowering plants in the citrus family Rutaceae. Most are endemic to Australia with a few species in New Caledonia, which were previously placed in the genus Boronella. They occur in all Australian states but the genus is under review and a number of species are yet to be described or have the description published. Boronias are similar to familiar plants in the genera Zieria, Eriostemon and Correa but can be distinguished from them by the number of petals or stamens. Some species have a distinctive fragrance and are popular garden plants. Description Plants in the genus Boronia are nearly always shrubs although a very small number occur as herbs or as small trees. The leaves are usually arranged in opposite pairs and may be simple leaves or compound leaves with up to nineteen or more leaflets, in either a pinnate or bipinnate arrangement. The flowers are arranged in groups in the leaf axils or on the ends of the branches and have both male and female parts. There are usually four separate sepals, usually four separate petals and generally eight stamens. (In Zieria there are only four stamens, Eriostemon species have five petals and in Correa the petals are joined to form a bell-shaped tube.) There are four carpels with their styles fused and there are two ovules in each carpel.Boronia algida in Mount Buffalo National ParkBoronia imlayensis in Mount Imlay National Park Taxonomy and naming The genus Boronia was first formally described in 1798 by James Edward Smith and the description was published in Tracts Relating to Natural History. The name Boronia honours Francesco Borone (1769 - 1794), Italian naturalist and plant collector, who assisted John Sibthorp in Greece and Turkey, Adam Afzelius in Sierra Leone and James Edward Smith during his European tour in 1787. Boronia, an outer suburb of Melbourne in Australia was named after a boronia found growing in the area. Distribution and habitat Boronias are found in all states and mainland territories of Australia and generally grow in open forests or woodlands, only rarely in rainforests or arid areas. Use in horticulture Boronias, especially B. megastigma, are known for their perfumed flowers. Most are regarded as desirable specimens in the garden, however, many are difficult to grow in cultivation. All species require excellent drainage and part shade.

The murder was denounced as a hate crime and brought attention to the lack of hate crime laws in various states, including Wyoming. An example of verbatim theatre, the play draws on hundreds of interviews conducted by the theatre company with inhabitants of the town, company members' own journal entries, and published news reports. It is divided into three acts, and eight actors portray more than sixty characters in a series of short scenes. Performances The Laramie Project premiered at The Ricketson Theatre by the Denver Center Theatre Company (Denver) (part of the Denver Center for the Performing Arts) in February 2000. It was next performed in the Union Square Theatre in New York CityTHEATER REVIEW; A Brutal Act Alters a Town before a November 2002 performance in Laramie, Wyoming. The play has also been performed by high schools, colleges, and community theaters across the country. It has been produced at professional playhouses in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. Many of the performances in the United States have been picketed by followers of Fred Phelps from the Westboro Baptist Church. They are portrayed in the play picketing Matthew Shepard's funeral as they did in real life. The play has been produced worldwide in the years since its premiere. But in 2009 it still generated controversy in Colorado and Las Vegas, Nevada, where some parents tried to block a production.

The play has also inspired grassroots efforts to combat homophobia. After seeing the play, New Jersey resident Dean Walton was inspired to donate more than 500 books and other media to the University of Wyoming's Rainbow Resource Center.

Film As a result of the play's success, HBO commissioned a 2002 film of The Laramie Project, also written and directed by Kaufman. Return to Laramie Ten years after Shepard's murder, members of Tectonic Theater Project returned to Laramie to conduct follow-up interviews with residents featured in the play. Those interviews were the basis of a companion piece, entitled The Laramie Project: Ten Years Later. The play debuted as a reading at nearly 150 theatres across the US and internationally on October 12, 2009 ‚Äì the 11th anniversary of Matthew Shepard's death. Many of the openings were linked by webcam to New York City, where Judy Shepard, Matthew's mother, and the play's producers and writers gave an opening speech, followed by an address by actress Glenn Close. Daniel DeWeldon played Aaron Mckinney opposite Barbara Bain in the Los Angeles production at Grand Performances, directed by Michael Arabian. The Laramie Project: Ten Years Later was presented for the first time in rep with The Laramie Project at the BAM Harvey Theater from February 12‚Äì24, 2013 as part of an event titled The Laramie Project Cycle. Directed by Kaufman and Leigh Fondakowski, the production featured much of the original cast reprising their roles.

One of six species of crested penguin, it is very closely related to the royal penguin, and some authorities consider the two to be a single species. It bears a distinctive yellow crest, and the face and upperparts are black and sharply delineated from the white underparts. Adults weigh on average and are in length. The male and female are similar in appearance; the male is slightly larger and stronger with a relatively larger bill. Like all penguins, it is flightless, with a streamlined body and wings stiffened and flattened into flippers for a marine lifestyle. Its diet consists of a variety of crustaceans, mainly krill, as well as small fish and cephalopods; the species consumes more marine life annually than any other species of seabird. These birds moult once a year, spending about three to four weeks ashore, before returning to the sea. Numbering up to 100,000 individuals, the breeding colonies of the macaroni penguin are among the largest and densest of all penguin species. After spending the summer breeding, penguins disperse into the oceans for six months; a 2009 study found that macaroni penguins from Kerguelen travelled over in the central Indian Ocean. With about 18 million individuals, the macaroni penguin is the most numerous penguin species. Widespread declines in populations have been recorded since the mid-1970s and their conservation status is classified as vulnerable. Taxonomy The macaroni penguin was described from the Falkland Islands in 1837 by German naturalist Johann Friedrich von Brandt.Williams (1995) p. 211 It is one of six or so species in the genus Eudyptes, collectively known as crested penguins. The genus name is derived from the Ancient Greek words eu \\"good\\", and dyptes \\"diver\\". The specific epithet chrysolophus is derived from the Greek words chryse \\"golden\\", and lophos \\"crest\\". The common name was recorded from the early 19th century in the Falkland Islands. English sailors apparently named the species for its conspicuous yellow crest; Maccaronism was a term for a particular style in 18th-century England marked by flamboyant or excessive ornamentation. A person who adopted this fashion was labelled a \\"maccaroni\\" or \\"macaroni\\", as in the song \\"Yankee Doodle\\". Molecular clock evidence using DNA suggests the macaroni penguin split from its closest relative, the royal penguin (Eudyptes schlegeli), around 1.5 million years ago. The two have generally been considered separate species, but the close similarities of their DNA sequences has led some, such as the Australian ornithologists Les Christidis and Walter Boles, to treat the royal as a subspecies of the macaroni. The two species are very similar in appearance; the royal penguin has a white face instead of the usually black face of the macaroni.Williams (1995) p. 214 Interbreeding with the Indo-Pacific subspecies of the southern rockhopper penguin (E. chrysocome filholi) has been reported at Heard and Marion Islands, with three hybrids recorded there by a 1987‚Äì88 Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition. Description A skeleton on display in Manchester Museum The macaroni penguin is a large, crested penguin, similar in appearance to other members of the genus Eudyptes. An adult bird has an average length of around ; the weight varies markedly depending on time of year and sex. Males average from after incubating, or after moult to before moult, while females average after to before moult.Williams (1995) p. 213 Among standard measurements, the thick bill (from the gape) measures , the culmen being around a centimetre less. The wing, from the shoulder to the tip, is around and the tail is long. The head, chin, throat, and upper parts are black and sharply demarcated against the white under parts. The black plumage has a bluish sheen when new and brownish when old. The most striking feature is the yellow crest that arises from a patch on the centre of the forehead, and extends horizontally backwards to the nape. The flippers are blue-black on the upper surface with a white trailing edge, and mainly white underneath with a black tip and leading edge. The large, bulbous bill is orange-brown. The iris is red and a patch of pinkish bare skin is found from the base of the bill to the eye. The legs and feet are pink. The male and female are similar in appearance; males tend to be slightly larger. Males also bear relatively larger bills, which average around compared to in females; this feature has been used to tell the sexes apart. Showing the conspicuous orange and yellow crests Immature birds are distinguished by their smaller size, smaller, duller-brown bill, dark grey chin and throat, and absent or underdeveloped head plumes, often just a scattering of yellow feathers. The crest is fully developed in birds aged three to four years, a year or two before breeding age. Macaroni penguins moult once a year, a process in which they replace all of their old feathers. They spend around two weeks accumulating fat before moulting because they do not feed during the moult, as they cannot enter the water to forage for food without feathers. The process typically takes three to four weeks, which they spend sitting ashore. Once finished, they go back to sea and return to their colonies to mate in the spring. Overall survival rates are poorly known; the successful return of breeding adults at South Georgia Island varied between 49% and 78% over three years, and around 10% of those that did return did not breed the following year.Williams (1995) p. 219 Distribution and habitat Cooper Bay, South Georgia A 1993 review estimated that the macaroni was the most abundant species of penguin, with a minimum of 11,841,600 pairs worldwide. Macaroni penguins range from the Subantarctic to the Antarctic Peninsula; at least 216 breeding colonies at 50 sites have been recorded. In South America, macaroni penguins are found in southern Chile, the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, and South Orkney Islands. They also occupy much of Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula, including the northern South Shetland Islands, Bouvet Island, the Prince Edward and Marion islands, the Crozet Islands, the Kerguelen Islands, and the Heard and McDonald Islands. While foraging for food, groups will range north to the islands off Australia, New Zealand, southern Brazil, Tristan da Cunha, and South Africa. Ecology = Feeding = The diet of the macaroni penguin consists of a variety of crustaceans, squid and fish; the proportions that each makes up vary with locality and season. Krill, particularly Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), account for over 90% of food during breeding season.Williams (1995) p. 215 Cephalopods and small fish such as the marbled rockcod (Notothenia rossii), painted notie (Lepidonotothen larseni), Champsocephalus gunneri, the lanternfish species Krefftichthys anderssoni, Protomyctophum tenisoni and P. normani become more important during chick-rearing.Williams (1995) pp. 215‚Äì16 Like several other penguin species, the macaroni penguin sometimes deliberately swallows small (10‚Äì to 30-mm-diameter) stones; this behaviour has been speculated to aid in providing ballast for deep-sea diving, or to help grind food, especially the exoskeletons of crustaceans which are a significant part of its diet. Foraging for food is generally conducted on a daily basis, from dawn to dusk when they have chicks to feed. Overnight trips are sometimes made, especially as the chicks grow older; a 2008 study that used surgically implanted data loggers to track the movement of the birds showed the foraging trips become longer once the chick-rearing period is over. Birds venture out for 10‚Äì20 days during incubation and before the moult. Macaroni penguins are known to be the largest single consumer of marine resources among all of the seabirds, with an estimated take of 9.2 million tonnes of krill a year. Outside the breeding season, macaroni penguins tend to dive deeper, longer, and more efficiently during their winter migration than during the summer breeding season. Year round, foraging dives usually occur during daylight hours, but winter dives are more constrained by daylight due to the shorter days. Foraging distance from colonies has been measured at around at South Georgia, offshore over the continental shelf, and anywhere from at Marion Island. Macaroni penguins normally forage at depths of , but have been recorded diving down to on occasions. Some night foraging does occur, but these dives are much shallower, ranging from only in depth. Dives rarely exceed two minutes in duration. All dives are V-shaped, and no time is spent at the sea bottom; about half the time on a foraging trip is spent diving. Birds have been calculated as catching from 4 to 16 krill or 40 to 50 amphipods per dive. =Predators= The macaroni penguin's predators consist of birds and aquatic mammals. The leopard seal (Hydrurga leptonyx), Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella), Subantarctic fur seal (A. tropicalis), and killer whale (Orcinus orca) hunt adult macaroni penguins in the water. Macaroni colonies suffer comparatively low rates of predation if undisturbed; predators generally only take eggs and chicks that have been left unattended or abandoned. Skua species, the snowy sheathbill (Chionis alba), and kelp gull (Larus dominicanus) prey on eggs, and skuas and giant petrels also take chicks and sick or injured adult birds. Life history A nesting pair at the Hannah Point, Livingston Island Like most other penguin species, the macaroni penguin is a social animal in its nesting and its foraging behaviour; its breeding colonies are among the largest and most densely populated. Scientist Charles Andre Bost found that macaroni penguins nesting at Kerguelen dispersed eastwards over an area exceeding 3√ó106 km2. Fitted with geolocation sensors, the 12 penguins studied travelled over during the six- to seven-month study period and spent their time largely within a zone 47‚Äì49¬∞S and 70‚Äì110¬∞E in the central Indian Ocean, not coming ashore once. This area, known as the Polar Frontal Zone, was notable for the absence of krill. An individual porpoising in Cooper Bay Living in colonies results in a high level of social interaction between birds, which has led to a large repertoire of visual, as well as vocal, displays.Williams (1995) p. 57 These behaviours peak early in the breeding period, and colonies particularly quieten when the male macaroni penguins are at sea.Williams (1995) p. 61 Agonistic displays are those which are intended to confront or drive off or, alternatively, appease and avoid conflict with other individuals. Macaroni penguins, particularly those on adjacent nests, may engage in 'bill-jousting'; birds lock bills and wrestle, each trying to unseat the other, as well as batter with flippers and peck or strike its opponent's nape.Williams (1995) p. 216 Submissive displays include the 'slender walk', where birds move through the colony with feathers flattened, flippers moved to the front of the body, and head and neck hunched, and general hunching of head and neck when incubating or standing at the nest.Williams (1995) p. 190 =Courtship and breeding= An egg from the Kerguelen Islands exhibited at Mus√©um de Toulouse Auckland Museum Female macaroni penguins can begin breeding at around five years of age, while the males do not normally breed until at least six years old. Females breed at a younger age because the male population is larger. The surplus of male penguins allows the female penguins to select more experienced male partners as soon as the females are physically able to breed. Commencing a few days after females arrive at the colony, sexual displays are used by males to attract partners and advertise their territory, and by pairs once together at the nest site and at changeover of incubation shifts. In the 'ecstatic display', a penguin bows forward, making loud throbbing sounds, and then extends its head and neck up until its neck and beak are vertical. The bird then waves its head from side to side, braying loudly.Williams (1995) p. 191 Birds also engage in mutual bowing, trumpeting, and preening. Monitoring of pair fidelity at South Georgia has shown around three-quarters of pairs will breed together again the following year. Adult macaroni penguins typically begin to breed late in October, and lay their eggs in early November. The nest itself is a shallow scrape in the ground which may be lined with some pebbles, stones, or grass, or nestled in a clump of tussock grass (on South Georgia Island). Nests are densely packed, ranging from around 66 cm apart in the middle of a colony to 86 cm at the edges.Williams (1995) p. 217 A fertile macaroni penguin will lay two eggs each breeding season. The first egg to be laid weighs , 61‚Äì64% the size of the second, and is extremely unlikely to survive. The two eggs together weigh 4.8% of the mother's body weight; the composition of an egg is 20% yolk, 66% albumen, and 14% shell.Williams (1995) p. 218 Like those of other penguin species, the shell is relatively thick to minimise risk of breakage, and the yolk is large, which is associated with chicks born in an advanced stage of development.Williams (1995) p. 24 Some of the yolk remains at hatching and is consumed by the chick in its first few days. The fate of the first egg is mostly unknown, but studies on the related royal penguin and erect-crested penguin show the female tips the egg out when the larger second egg is laid. The task of incubating the egg is divided into three roughly equal sessions of around 12 days each over a five-week period. The first session is shared by both parents, followed by the male returning to sea, leaving the female alone to tend the egg. Upon the male's return, the female goes off to sea and does not return until the chick has hatched. Both sexes fast for a considerable period during breeding; the male fasts for 37 days after arrival until he returns to sea for around 10 days before fasting while incubating eggs and young for another 36 days, and the female fasts for 42 days from her arrival after the male until late in the incubation period.Williams (1995) p. 112 Both adults lose 36‚Äì40% of their body weight during this period.Williams (1995) p. 113 The second egg hatches around 34 days after it is laid. Macaroni penguins typically leave their breeding colony by April or May to disperse into the ocean. From the moment the egg is hatched, the male macaroni penguin cares for the newly hatched chick. For about 23 to 25 days, the male protects its offspring and helps to keep it warm, since only a few of its feathers have grown in by this time. The female brings food to the chick every one to two days. When they are not being protected by the adult male penguins, the chicks form cr√®ches to keep warm and stay protected. Once their adult feathers have grown in at about 60 to 70 days, they are ready to go out to sea on their own. Conservation The population of macaroni penguins is estimated at around 18 million mature individuals; a substantial decline has been recorded in several locations. This includes a 50% reduction in the South Georgia population between the mid-1970s to mid-1990s, and the disappearance of the species from Isla Recalada in Southern Chile. This decline of the overall population in the last 30 years has resulted in the classification of the species as globally Vulnerable by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Long-term monitoring programs are underway at a number of breeding colonies, and many of the islands that support breeding populations of this penguin are protected reserves. The Heard Islands and McDonald Islands are World Heritage Sites for the macaroni penguin. The macaroni penguin may be being impacted by commercial fishing and marine pollution. A 2008 study suggests the abilities of female penguins to reproduce may be negatively affected by climate- and fishing- induced reductions in krill density.

As liquid crystals are birefringent, applying a voltage to the cell changes the effective refractive index seen by the incident wave, and thus the phase retardation of the reflected wave. A spatial light modulator (SLM) is an object that imposes some form of spatially varying modulation on a beam of light. A simple example is an overhead projector transparency. Usually when the phrase SLM is used, it means that the transparency can be controlled by a computer. In the 1980s, large SLMs were placed on overhead projectors to project computer monitor contents to the screen. Since then more modern projectors have been developed where the SLM is built inside the projector. These are commonly used in meetings of all kinds for presentations. Usually, a SLM modulates the intensity of the light beam. However, it is also possible to produce devices that modulate the phase of the beam or both the intensity and the phase simultaneously. SLMs are used extensively in holographic data storage setups to encode information into a laser beam similarly to way a transparency does for an overhead projector. They can also be used as part of a holographic display technology. SLMs have been used as a component in optical computing. They also often find application in holographic optical tweezers. Liquid crystal SLMs can help solve problems related to laser microparticle manipulation. In this case spiral beam parameters can be changed dynamically. Electrically-addressed spatial light modulator (EASLM) An LCD-based reflection EASLM. The reflective surface is the functional area. As its name implies, the image on an electrically addressed spatial light modulator is created and changed electronically, as in most electronic displays. EASLMs usually receive input via a conventional interface such as VGA or DVI input. They are available at resolutions up to QXGA (2048 √ó 1536). Unlike ordinary displays, they are usually much smaller (having an active area of about 2 cm¬≤) as they are not normally meant to be viewed directly. An example of an EASLM is the Digital Micromirror Device at the heart of DLP displays or LCoS Displays using ferroelectric liquid crystals (FLCoS) or nematic liquid crystals (Electrically Controlled Birefringence effect). Optically-addressed spatial light modulator (OASLM) The image on an optically addressed spatial light modulator, also known as a light valve, is created and changed by shining light encoded with an image on its front or back surface. A photosensor allows the OASLM to sense the brightness of each pixel and replicate the image using liquid crystals. As long as the OASLM is powered, the image is retained even after the light is extinguished. An electrical signal is used to clear the whole OASLM at once. They are often used as the second stage of a very-high-resolution display, such as one for a computer-generated holographic display. In a process called active tiling, images displayed on an EASLM are sequentially transferred to different parts on an OASLM, before the whole image on the OASLM is presented to the viewer. As EASLMs can run as fast as 2500 frames per second, it is possible to tile around 100 copies of the image on the EASLM onto an OASLM while still displaying full-motion video on the OASLM. This potentially gives images with resolutions of above 100 megapixels. Application in ultrafast pulse measuring and shaping Multiphoton intrapulse interference phase scan (MIIPS) is a technique based on the computer-controlled phase scan of a linear-array spatial light modulator. Through the phase scan to an ultrashort pulse, MIIPS can not only characterize but also manipulate the ultrashort pulse to get the needed pulse shape at target spot (such as transform-limited pulse for optimized peak power, and other specific pulse shapes). This technique features with full calibration and control of the ultrashort pulse, with no moving parts, and simple optical setup. Linear array SLMs that use nematic liquid crystal elements are available that can modulate amplitude, phase, or both simultaneously.

Ottoman war flag during WWI. The Ottoman Empire used a variety of flags, especially as naval ensigns, during its history. The star and crescent came into use in the second half of the 18th century. A ' (decree) from 1793 required that the ships of the Ottoman Navy were to use a red flag with the star and crescent in white. In 1844, a version of this flag, with a five-pointed star, was officially adopted as the Ottoman national flag. The decision to adopt a national flag was part of the Tanzimat reforms which aimed to modernize the Ottoman state in line with the laws and norms of contemporary European states and institutions. The star and crescent design later became a common element in the national flags of Ottoman successor states in the 20th century. The current flag of Turkey is essentially the same as the late Ottoman flag, but has more specific legal standardizations (regarding its measures, geometric proportions, and exact tone of red) that were introduced with the Turkish Flag Law on May 29, 1936. Before the legal standardization, the star and crescent could have slightly varying slimness or positioning depending on the rendition. Early flags Pre-modern Ottoman armies used the horse-tail standard or tugh rather than flags. Such standards remained in use alongside flags until the 19th century. A depiction of a tugh appears in the ' by Joseph Pitton de Tournefort (1718).' cited after Marc Pasquin, 22 November 2004, crwflags.com; c.f. also a facsimile image hosted at the website of the . War flags came into use by the 16th century. During the 16th and 17th centuries, Ottoman war flags often depicted the bifurcated Zulfiqar sword, often misinterpreted in Western literature as showing a pair of scissors.For example: Jacques-Nicolas Bellin, ' (1756). the Topkapƒ± Museum exhibits a Zulfiqar flag claimed to have been used by Sultan Selim I (). Two Zulfiqar flags are also depicted in a plate dedicated to Turkish flags in vol. 7 of Bernard Picart's ' (1737), attributed to the Janissaries and the Ottoman cavalry. The crescent symbol appears in flags attributed to Tunis from as early as the 14th century ('), long before Tunis fell under Ottoman rule in 1574. But the crescent as a symbol also had 14th-century associations with the Ottoman military and millennium-long associations with the city of Istanbul, which became the Ottoman capital after its conquest in 1453. The Spanish Navy Museum in Madrid shows two Ottoman naval flags dated 1613; both are swallow- tailed, one green with a white crescent near the hoist, the other white with two red stripes near the edges of the flag and a red crescent near the hoist.

Star and Crescent flag Following the conquest of Constantinople in 1453, the crescent moon and star symbol started being used on Turkic peoples flags. Ottoman flags were originally commonly green, but the flag was defined as red by decree in 1793 and an eight-pointed star was added. The red version of the flag had become ubiquitous by the reign of Selim III. The five pointed star did not appear until the 1840s. With the Tanzimat reforms in the 19th century, flags were redesigned in the style of the European armies of the day. The flag of the Ottoman Navy was made red, as red was to be the flag of secular institutions and green of religious ones. As the reforms abolished all the various flags (standards) of the Ottoman pashaliks, beyliks and emirates, a single new Ottoman national flag was designed to replace them. The result was the red flag with the white crescent moon and star, which is the precursor to the modern flag of Turkey. A plain red flag was introduced as the civil ensign for all Ottoman subjects. After the foundation of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, the new Turkish state maintained the last flag of the Ottoman Empire. Proportional standardisations were introduced in the Turkish Flag Law () of 29 May 1936.

File:Ottoman Navy at the Golden Horn.jpgThe Ottoman Navy on a postcard from World War I, with an image of Sultan Mehmed V. =Source of the Star and Crescent symbol= It has been suggested that the star-and- crescent used in Ottoman flags of the 19th century had been adopted from the Byzantines. Franz Babinger (1992) suggests this possibility, noting that the crescent alone has a much older tradition also with Turkic tribes in the interior of Asia.\\"It seems possible, though not certain, that after the conquest Mehmed took over the crescent and star as an emblem of sovereignty from the Byzantines. The half-moon alone on a blood red flag, allegedly conferred on the Janissaries by Emir Orhan, was much older, as is demonstrated by numerous references to it dating from before 1453. But since these flags lack the star, which along with the half-moon is to be found on Sassanid and Byzantine municipal coins, it may be regarded as an innovation of Mehmed. It seems certain that in the interior of Asia tribes of Turkish nomads had been using the half-moon alone as an emblem for some time past, but it is equally certain that crescent and star together are attested only for a much later period. There is good reason to believe that old Turkish and Byzantine traditions were combined in the emblem of Ottoman and, much later, present-day Republican Turkish sovereignty.\\" Franz Babinger (William C. Hickman Ed., Ralph Manheim Trans.), Mehmed the Conqueror and His Time, Princeton University Press, 1992, p 108 The crescent and star is found on the coinage of Byzantium since the 4th century BC and was depicted on Byzantine Empire's coins and shields of Christian warrior saints till the 13th century. Parsons (2007) notes that the star and crescent was not a widespread motive on the coinage of Byzantium at the time of the Ottoman conquest.John Denham Parsons, The Non- Christian Cross, BiblioBazaar, 2007, p 69: \\"Moreover, the question is what the symbol of Constantinople was at the time it was captured by the Turks. And an inspection of the coins issued by the Christian rulers of that city during the thousand years and more it was in their hands, will reveal to the enquirer that though the crescent with a cross within its horns appears occasionally upon the coins of the Emperors of the East, and in one or two instances we see a cross of four equal arms with each extremity piercing a crescent, it is doubtful if a single example of the so-called \\"star and crescent\\" symbol can be found upon them.\\" Turkish historians tend to stress the antiquity of the crescent (not star-and-crescent) symbol among the early Turkic states in Asia.\\"It is clear, however, that, whatever the origin, the crescent was used by Turkish states in various regions of Asia, and there is absolutely no reason to claim that it passed to the Ottomans from Byzantium\\" Mehmet Fuat K√∂pr√ºl√º, Gary Leiser (Trans.), Some Observations on the Influence of Byzantine Institutions on Ottoman institutions, T√ºrk Tarih Kurumu, 1999, p 118 Imperial standards Adopted in 1882, the coat of arms of the Ottoman Empire featured a green flag at left (representing the Rumelia Eyalet) and red flag at right (representing the Anatolia Eyalet and the other Asian eyalets).Sosyal Medyada ≈ûeriat Bayraƒüƒ± Diye Payla≈üƒ±lan Bayraƒüƒ±n Aslƒ±nda Rumeli'den Gelmesi (in Turkish) The imperial standard displayed the sultan's tughra, often on a pink or bright red background.

Its habitat is threatened by deforestation on the island. This gecko, along with several other Rhacodactylus species are being considered for protective measures by CITES, which would put restrictions on their exportation. This gecko was first described by Bavay in 1869.  Description  This reptile gets its common name from the cranial bumps that give the appearance of horns or ears; In fact, auriculatus is Latin for \\"ears\\" or \\"eared\\", depending on the case. Other characteristics of this gecko include a thin prehensile tail which will regenerate if it drops off,http://www.reptilesmagazine.com/Care-Sheets/Lizards/Gargoyle-Gecko/ as well as small toe pads. Although these geckos have the ability to grip vines, branches, and other obstacles, most do not have the ability to climb sheer surfaces, such as glass. As small as one inch long (from snout to vent) and weighing 3 grams at hatching, it reaches an average length of 7 to 9 inches and 60 to 70 grams in weight. They are considered a small to medium size gecko. They occur in many colors, including varying shades of greys, browns, white, yellow, orange, and red, with varying patterns of blotches and striping. They are commonly captive bred for particular traits of pattern and color, like most captive geckos.  Behavior  Gargoyle geckos are crepuscular and arboreal, making their home in scrub forests. The female lays two eggs per clutch, which hatch 60 to 90 days after they are laid. The female can lay eight or nine clutches per year. In captivity, it is fairly easy to hand tame these geckos, because they adapt to a human touching them, and know food comes when one is around sometimes. They have been observed in captivity to be very adventurous, and some will appreciate a change up in tank decorations. They can propel themselves almost three times their body length to reach a vine or tree branch, yet their feet do not have as much traction as other gecko's feet do, so they slip every now and then, making them seem clumsy. Moving about is no problem to them, as long as their skin is kept moist, it will stretch and accommodate their movements. When handling one, one should pay close attention to it as they are very quick.  In captivity  Gargoyle geckos make interesting terrarium animals. In captivity, these geckos will accept fruit mashes, fruit and powdered gecko diet (mixed with water). Crested gecko diet is commonly given as a primary food source. Gecko food can be purchased from companies that specialize in it, such as Repashy or Pangea; these foods have the correct nutritional balance of vitamins and minerals, which is not found in basic fruit purees. As treats, these geckos sometimes (depending on the individual) accept live foods such as crickets, feeder roaches, and waxworms, which should be gut loaded, or dusted with vitamins and calcium as extra precautions. Rhacodactylus species are relatively new to being kept in homes and there is much still to be learned, since many species were thought to be extinct. Adult gargoyle are housed in a twenty-gallon, tall tank, or something of similar size. Gargoyle gecko males are always housed separately or as a part of a breeding pair or trio with females, as males housed together will always fight. Juveniles are known to be very aggressive towards cage mates as well. Cannibalism of cage mates' tails, toes and other extremities is not uncommon. Except during the breeding season, they are housed separately, no matter the sex, age, or size. Maintaining a humidity level around 60-70% is ideal. While the tank should be misted in the morning and at night it should dry out to no less than 50% humidity during the day. Live plants and tropical soil help maintain a high level of humidity.

The technique has been incorporated by academics within the fields of biology, evolution, bioinformatics and the social sciences. It is closely related to the philosophical concept known as Wittgenstein's ladder.  Origin  The \\"lie-to-children\\" concept was first discussed by scientist Jack Cohen and mathematician Ian Stewart in the 1994 book The Collapse of Chaos: Discovering Simplicity in a Complex World. They further elaborated upon their views in their coauthored 1997 book Figments of Reality: The Evolution of the Curious Mind. The concept gained greater exposure when they collaborated with popular author Terry Pratchett, discussing \\"lies-to-children\\" in the book The Science of Discworld (1999). Cohen and Stewart discussed \\"lies-to-children\\" and the desire inherent in society for a view of simplicity with regards to complex concepts in their 1994 book The Collapse of Chaos. Stewart and Cohen wrote in Figments of Reality (1997) that the lie-to-children concept reflected the difficulty inherent in reducing complex concepts during the education process. Stewart and Cohen noted reality itself was viewed within the prism of human perspective: \\"Any description suitable for human minds to grasp must be some type of lie-to-children ‚Äî real reality is always much too complicated for our limited minds.\\" Librarian and editor Andrew Sawyer discussed the \\"lie-to- children\\" concept introduced by scientists Cohen and Stewart in their early two non-fiction books. Sawyer wrote: \\"In The Collapse of Chaos and Figments of Reality, we also come across the concept of 'lies-to-children' ‚Äî the necessarily simplified stories we tell children and students as a foundation for understanding so that eventually they can discover that they are not, in fact, true.\\" The definition given in The Science of Discworld (1999) is as follows: \\"A lie-to-children is a statement that is false, but which nevertheless leads the child's mind towards a more accurate explanation, one that the child will only be able to appreciate if it has been primed with the lie\\". The authors acknowledge that some people might dispute the applicability of the term lie, while defending it on the grounds that \\"it is for the best possible reasons, but it is still a lie\\". This viewpoint is derived from earlier perspectives within the field of philosophy of science. In a 1999 interview, Pratchett commented upon the phrase: \\"I like the lies-to-children motif, because it underlies the way we run our society and resonates nicely with Discworld.\\" He was critical of problems inherent in early education: \\"You arrive with your sparkling A-levels all agleam, and the first job of the tutors is to reveal that what you thought was true is only true for a given value of 'truth'.\\" Pratchett cautioned: \\"Most of us need just 'enough' knowledge of the sciences, and it's delivered to us in metaphors and analogies that bite us in the bum if we think they're the same as the truth.\\" Cohen and Stewart further elaborated upon the lie-to-children trope in a 2002 book they coauthored on exobiology, Evolving the Alien: The Science of Extraterrestrial Life. Within the work, the authors were critical of use of lie-to-children as an educational methodology which had an unfortunate side-effect of reducing complex science concepts to overly simplified explanations. Stewart was asked in a 2015 interview about his views on Pratchett beyond the influence of lie- to-children, and the author's take on the understanding of science. Stewart commented upon the interaction between himself and Cohen with Pratchett during the writing process: \\"Terry wasn't trained as a scientist, but he had the right kind of critical attitude. He was extraordinarily widely read, and would ask all sorts of unexpected questions that really got me and Jack thinking.\\" Authors Michael Moorhouse and Paul Barry recommended the original works discussing the concept for further analysis of the phenomenon: \\"These are well worth a read if you fancy a laugh while pretending to work.\\"  Use in adult education  The term \\"lie to children\\" should not be taken to imply that it is exclusively used in childhood education. Educators in secondary and post- secondary schools employ increasingly-accurate yet still \\"untrue\\" models as a means of explicating complex topics. A typical example of this is found in physics, where the Bohr model of atomic electron shells is still often used to introduce atomic structure before moving on to more complex models based on matrix mechanics; and in chemistry, where the Arrhenius definitions of acids and bases are often introduced, followed (in a manner similar to the historical development of the model) by the Br√∏nsted‚ÄìLowry definitions and then the Lewis definitions. High school teachers and university instructors often explain at the outset that the model they are about to present is incomplete. An example of this is given by Gerald Sussman during the 1986 video recording of the Abelson-Sussman Lectures (lecture 1-b): > If we're going to understand processes and how we control them, then we have > to have a mapping from the mechanisms of this procedure into the way in > which these processes behave. What we're going to have is a formal, or semi- > formal, mechanical model whereby you understand how a machine could, in > fact, in principle, do this. Whether or not the actual machine really does > what I'm about to tell you is completely irrelevant at this moment. In fact, > this is an engineering model, in the same way that, [for an] electrical > resistor, we write down a model V = IR ‚Äî it's approximately true, but it's > not really true; if I put enough current through the resistor, it goes boom, > so the voltage is not always proportional to the current, but for some > purposes the model is appropriate. In particular, the model we're going to > describe right now, which I call the substitution model, is the simplest > model that we have for understanding how procedures work and how processes > work ‚Äî how procedures yield processes. And that substitution model will be > accurate for most of the things we'll be dealing with in the next few days. > But eventually, it will become impossible to sustain the illusion that > that's the way the machine works, and we'll go to other, more specific and > particular models that will show more detail.  Analysis  British author David Langford wrote in 1999 that his favorite theme within Discworld was the lie-to-children trope. The concept of lie-to- children was discussed at-length in 2000 by Andrew Sawyer, where the subject itself was included in the article title: \\"Narrativium and Lies-to-Children: 'Palatable Instruction in 'The Science of Discworld'\\". Sawyer wrote that: \\"The 'lies-to-children' we tell ourselves about science are a different form of science fiction: one, perhaps where 'fiction' qualifies the word 'science.' They are 'fictions about science' rather than 'science fictions.'\\" Sawyer concluded: \\"The strength of The Science of Discworld ‚Äî and why in many ways it is something new in science writing ‚Äî derives from Pratchett's story being more than a parable constructed for the specific purpose of explaining what the scientists have to say. It is, as has been said, a commentary/parody of the scientific method\\". In a contribution about evolution for the 2001 book Nonlinear Dynamics in the Life and Social Sciences, reproductive biologist Jack Cohen discussed the lie-to-children teaching technique and its use educating students on the concept of evolution and its complex facets including the notion that DNA is an architectural guide for life. The author concluded: \\"Only the search for universal features, while treasuring all the exceptional specifics, offers some hope of sketching out the general shape of the evolutionary process so that we can explain it honestly as a Lie-to- Children.\\" D.J. Jeffrey and Robert M. Corless of the Ontario Research Centre for Computer Algebra at the University of Western Ontario wrote in their 2001 computer science paper on linear algebra instruction on the teaching concept. Jeffrey and Corless identified a \\"useful\\" lie-to-children, as one in which: \\"The pedagogical point is to avoid unnecessary burdens on the student‚Äôs first encounter with the concept.\\" The authors gave an example from early childhood mathematics instruction: \\"We happily teach children that 'you cannot take 3 from 2' because we are confident that someone will later introduce them to negative numbers.\\" Corless further expounded on this view in a subsequent paper published in 2004, writing: \\"A 'lie to children' is a useful oversimplification that starts one on the path to better knowledge. It is a truth unacknowledged that mathematics before computers was a lie to children.\\" In their 2004 book Bioinformatics, Biocomputing and Perl, authors Michael Moorhouse and Paul Barry explained how the lie-to-children model may be utilized as a teaching technique for the concepts of protein, RNA, and DNA. Moorhouse and Barry wrote that the lie-to-children methodology can reduce complex academic notions to a simpler format for basic understanding. The authors conclude that the lie-to-children teaching technique: \\"allows the basic features to be understood without confusing things by considering exceptions and enhancements.\\" Haroom Kharem and Genevieve Collura were critical of the teaching practice, in a contribution to the 2010 book Teaching Bilingual/Bicultural Children. The authors wrote that using this teaching method was a form of disrespect for the truth. Kharem and Collura lament that rather than imparting truth to children, \\"a pedagogy of stupidification is promoted in which teachers imbue students with untruths and then wonder why education has problems. Sooner or later the fabrications we teach students will come to light and the respect educators expect from students will become disingenuous.\\" North Eastern Hill University economics professor Sudhanshu K. Mishra in 2010 defined the phrase as: \\"A lie-to-children is a lie, often a platitude, which may use euphemism(s), which is told to make an adult subject acceptable to children.\\" Mishra gave as an example parents who engage in mythology by lying to their children and telling them they were brought by a stork to the house, instead of explaining childbirth. In a 2011 contribution to the academic journal Digital Difference, Hamish Macleod and Jen Ross discussed the lie-to-children concept and wrote that this teaching methodology can have the negative impact of introducing studying difficulties to students as they progress further in their education. They cautioned this could lead to a negative influence on students' future behaviors. Macleod and Ross wrote: \\"Playing devil's advocate is in itself a challenging notion for many learners, who may, especially in their early years of higher education, be conditioned by what Stewart and Cohen call 'lies to children' to expect simple and unambiguous questions and equally simple answers.\\" Writing in 2011 for the Carleton College website, geophysicist Kim Kastens in a column with her daughter at first found the notion of lie-to-children as surprising. Kastens delved further into the issue, and identified specific instances where a lie- to-children teaching technique would do more harm than good for students. The worst examples included a lie-to-children which would later have to be unlearned following teaching from subsequent professors, an instance where the student is successfully able to identify the factual inaccuracy and knows more about it than the teacher, and using the technique without having a \\"master plan\\" involving progressive learning. In her 2011 book The Children's Bill of Emotional Rights, Eileen Johnson discussed the lies told by parents to their children during the formation of childhood fictional mythology and pointed out the inherent problems this could raise in the future during the parenting process. Johnson cautioned: \\"Why do we tell these lies to children? At some point we have to admit we were lying. Parents are not sure how much of this deceit is right, how far to go with it, and how and when to explain it was all a lie.\\" Kirsten Walsh and Adrian Currie contributed a 2015 article to the journal Metaphilosophy in which they quoted the verbatim definition of lie-to- children from The Science of Discworld and discussed the impact of such behavior on students. Walsh and Currie concluded that mythmaking within education in order to teach a more complex concept is a form of unwarranted behavior with detrimental impact upon instruction methodology. In a 2015 article, The Conversation compared the concept to Wittgenstein's ladder, and defined it: \\"that in order to get across a complicated idea, sometimes you need to use an explanation that is actually wrong but which helps a child ‚Äì or anyone learning about anything complex ‚Äì build an understanding of that issue.\\" Writing for Forbes in 2015, physics professor and science journalist Chad Orzel explained the concept: \\"Lies-to-children are not strictly true, but they‚Äôre simplified in a way that makes them easier to grasp for children, and provide a framework that allows for future elaboration.\\" Orzel praised the University of California Museum of Paleontology initiative Understanding Science for its strategy of going beyond a simple explanation of the scientific method in a lie-to-children format, and instead going into more depth and specifics to directly inform others on how science impacts their daily quality of living. British writer Tim Worstall expounded upon the lie- to-children phenomenon in education, in a 2015 article for Forbes. He wrote: \\"that‚Äôs what Terry Pratchett pointed out education was: lies to children to help them make some sense of the world. When they become older, more capable of nuance, then we point this out to them: those previous stories were gross simplifications and now you need to know the caveats.\\" Worstall stressed that this form of educational methodology was ubiquitous across multiple academic disciplines: \\"This is true of any form of education by the way. We don‚Äôt start music classes with atonality, we start with simple scales. We don‚Äôt do syncopation until we‚Äôve mastered 2/4 and 4/4. Einstein‚Äôs corrections at the margin to Newton come quite late in a physics education.\\"  See also       *  References   Further reading   * *  External links   * * Category:Philosophy of science Category:Philosophy of education Category:Pedagogy Category:Communication of falsehoods Category:Deception Category:Discworld ","title":"Lie-to-children"},{"id":"549356","text":"The World Data Centre (WDC) system was created to archive and distribute data collected from the observational programmes of the 1957-1958 International Geophysical Year by the International Council of Science (ICSU).

This is now disputed.Edmund (2016) 'The Proculus Enigma: Have the history books been telling it wrong?', University of Warwick Probably Proculus had family connection with the Franks, to whom he turned in vain when his bid for imperial power was failing. He was a native of Albingaunum (modern Albenga in Liguria). Though he was accounted a noble, his ancestors had been brigands and were the source of his vast wealth. Proculus was able to arm 2000 slaves of his own latifundia after seizing imperial office in the West. He was married to a woman named Vituriga, who was given the nickname \\"Samso\\" for her capabilities (considered \\"unwomanly\\" by the fourth century author of Historia Augusta),huic uxor virago, quae illum in hanc praecipitavit dementiam, nomine Samso, quod ei postea inditum est, nam antea Vituriga nominata est. and at the time of his usurpation, he had one son, Herennianus, aged four. Proculus was an ambitious soldier, who had commanded more than one legion as tribune; when in 280 he was asked by the people of Lugdunum (Lyon) who had started a rebellion against Emperor Probus to take the purple, he accepted, proclaiming himself joint emperor with Bonosus. \\"He was, nevertheless, of some benefit to the Gauls, for he crushed the Alamanni ‚Äî who then were still called Germans ‚Äî and not without illustrious glory, though he never fought save in brigand- fashion\\" (Historia Augusta) On his return from fighting the Sassanids in Syria, Probus forced Proculus to retreat north.

It is a recurring theme in the seminal MIT textbook, the Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, which uses Scheme as a framework for constructing new languages. Explanation For example, consider modelling an airport inside a computer. A procedural (e.g. C) programmer would create data structures to represent the elements of an airport and procedures or routines to operate on those data structures. An object-oriented (e.g. C++) programmer would create objects to represent the elements of the airport with methods which represent their behaviors. A functional (e.g. Scheme) programmer would create higher-order functions representing both the elements and behaviors of the airport. A metalinguistic programmer would abstract the problem by creating new, embedded domain specific languages for modelling an airport, with peculiar primitives and types for doing so naturalistically. The language could then encompass any or all of the above techniques as required by the problem at hand.Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, Part 4 ‚Äî Metalinguistic Abstraction Because the creation of functional metalinguistic abstractions in non- functional languages can be cumbersome while the reverse is usually trivial, and also because of the syntactic flexibility and referential safety of functional macros, metalinguistic programming is mostly idiomatic of functional programming languages.

She took part in the Fleet Air Arm raid that crippled the Italian Fleet at Taranto in 1940. She had the unfortunate experience of sinking two Allied ships during her wartime service, once through accidental collision and the other by gunfire after a case of mistaken identify.  Construction  Laid down on 16 April 1935, Glasgow was launched on 20 June 1936 by Lucy Baldwin, the wife of the prime minister Stanley Baldwin. She entered service without some components of her main armament's fire control system, which were subsequently fitted at the end of that year. She commenced sea trials in the spring of 1937. Designed with a maximum design speed of she achieved at standard displacement during her trials. She was subsequently commissioned on 9 September 1937.  Service history  = Pre-war service = Upon entering service Glasgow was allocated to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron of the Home Fleet. Her service was mostly uneventful, consisting of fleet exercises and 'flag showing'. Her most glamorous operation was when together with her sister HMS Southampton she escorted the liner Empress of Australia on the outward and the liner Empress of Britain on the return voyage carrying King George VI and Queen Elizabeth to Canada on their royal visit to the United States and Canada in May and June 1939. = Norwegian Campaign = King George VI, wearing the uniform of an Admiral of the Fleet, inspecting personnel from Glasgows crew at Scapa Flow as part of a four-day visit to the Home Fleet. Her two forward 6-inch gun turrets can be seen in the background Glasgow remained allocated to the Home Fleet during the first year of the Second World War, under the command of Captain Frank Pegram from July 1939 to April 1940. With war approaching, Glasgow sailed on 2 September 1939 from Grimsby to patrol off the Norwegian coast with Humber Force to intercept any German commerce raider attempting to reach the Atlantic or any blockade runner returning to Germany. While operating with the Humber Force she in company with the cruisers Southampton and Edinburgh was subjected to a heavy air attack by the Luftwaffe on 9 October 1939, but suffered no damage despite 120 bombs being dropped on the ships. On the outbreak of war, she operated off the Scandinavian coast, and in November was off the coast of Norway with two destroyers in the hope of intercepting the German passenger ship which had sailed from Murmansk. This was unsuccessful, but on 12 February 1940, she captured the German trawler off Troms√∏.German steam trawlers off Norway in 1940 On 9 April 1940, she was attacked off Bergen by Junkers Ju 88 and Heinkel He 111 aircraft and damaged by two near misses. Both bombs of fell about from the ship's side, one bursting on impact abreast station 70 and the other under water further forward. A large proportion of the bomb which burst on impact entered the ship above the lower deck level, holing an area of approximately with about 60 scattered splinters entering the ship's side in all. The ship's movement allowed a considerable quantity of water to enter the hull causing the messdecks between stations 53 ‚Äì 74 to be flooded by of water. Some minor underwater damage and a small amount of flooding occurred further forward, probably as a result of the other bomb. In addition the forward 'A' turret was temporarily out of action. Two crew members were killed and five were wounded. After returning to Scapa Flow on 10 April for temporary repairs and transfer of the dead and wounded the ship returned to sea 22 hours later. On 11 April 1940, during the Allied campaign in Norway in World War II, Glasgow, along with and six s landed troops near Harstad and three days later on 14 April, again in company with Sheffield and ten destroyers, landed an advance force of Royal Marines at Namsos to seize and secure the wharves and approaches to the town, preparatory to the landing of a larger Allied force. On 23 April Glasgow, Sheffield, and six destroyers landed the first part of the 15th Infantry Brigade in √Öndalsnes. On 29 April, she evacuated King Haakon and Crown Prince Olav of Norway, Nygaardsvold's Cabinet and part of the Norwegian gold reserves when they fled from Molde to Troms√∏, escaping the advancing German forces. She then departed to the United Kingdom on 1 May, carrying among others the Minister of Foreign Affairs Halvdan Koht and the Minister of Defence Birger Ljungberg. =Mediterranean service= Whilst operating in home waters after the withdrawal from Norway, Glasgow accidentally rammed and sank the destroyer in thick fog off Duncansby Head on 16 July 1940. Glasgow was able to rescue the majority of the destroyer's crew but unfortunately 19 lost their lives as well as two crew members of Glasgow. Following repairs Glasgow was transferred to the Mediterranean where she was employed as a convoy escort and as a reinforcement of the 3rd Cruiser Squadron based at Alexandria. She took part in the Fleet Air Arm raid that crippled the Italian Fleet at Taranto; on 14 November, Glasgow, along with , and , landed 3,400 troops from Alexandria in Piraeus. On 26 November, Glasgow, and York escorted a supply convoy from Alexandria to Malta. On 3 December Glasgow was attacked by Italian aircraft while anchored in Suda Bay, Crete. She was hit by two torpedoes fired by a Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 flown by Carlo Emanuele Buscaglia. The torpedoes struck far forward and aft, the latter putting two of her propeller shafts out of service. Other than that she received only moderate damage. She was able to return to Alexandria, where as the shipyard did not have the resources and capability to make a full repair, she was repaired to a level that allowed her to return to secondary duties. During this period she was temporarily replaced by . =Far East service= As a result of her diminished capability Glasgow was allocated to the Indian Ocean, leaving Alexandria on 12 February 1941 and passing through the Suez Canal.Neil MacCart, Town Class Cruisers, Maritime Books, 2012, , p. 153 On 18 February she joined East Indies Fleet at Aden. In February the sank the freighters Canadian Cruiser and Rantaupandjang in the Indian Ocean. Both managed to transmit distress signals, that were picked up by Glasgow, which deployed in search of the German ship. On 22 January, Admiral Scheer was sighted by the spotter aircraft from Glasgow, the East Indies Task Force was deployed to the reported area. However, Admiral Scheer had escaped by turning away to the southeast and further searches were in vain. In March Glasgow, in company with , two auxiliary cruisers, two destroyers and two anti-submarine trawlers of the Indian Navy, escorted two troop transport vessels containing two Indian Battalions and one Somali commando detachment, who were landed on either side of Berbera, in Somaliland, which had previously been occupied by the Italians. The town was taken after only slight Italian resistance, which was soon broken by naval gunfire from Glasgow and the other escorts. At midnight on 9 December 1941, Glasgow sank the RIN patrol vessel HMIS Prabhavati with two lighters in tow en route to Karachi, with 6-inch shells at . Prabhavati was alongside the lighters and was mistaken for a surfaced Japanese submarine. Glasgow picked up the survivors and took them to Bombay, arriving there later that day. On 19 March 1942, Glasgow escorted convoy WS-16 from the UK to South Africa. In April Glasgow again underwent temporary repairs, this time in Simonstown, South Africa. She subsequently sailed to the US for permanent repairs at the Brooklyn Navy Yard from 6 May onwards. As well as repairing the damage from her 1940 torpedo attack additional 20 mm Oerlikon cannons were added to improve her close range anti-aircraft capability. As well it was decided to improve her radar suite by replacing her existing type 286M radar with the new type 271, while a type 284 fire-control radar to control her main armament, type 285 and 282 aircraft warning fire-control and type 281 aircraft warning radars were installed. Following the completion of her shipyard work she returned to the UK in August to complete work on her radar installations at Portsmouth before joining the 10th Cruiser Squadron at Scapa Flow, on 3 September where she was assigned to the covering forces of the Arctic convoys. = In the Arctic and home waters = HMS Glasgow (left) and (right) during the bombardment of Cherbourg in support of the advancing Allied troops Glasgow escorted Arctic convoys between January and February 1943. In March she intercepted the German blockade runner Regensburg in the Denmark Strait as it returned form the Far East with valuable rubber, tungsten and other commodities. Her crew managed to scuttle the ship, but most of the crew drowned in the heavy seas while abandoning her, with Glasgow being able to recover only six survivors. During June and July she supplied cover for escort groups in the Bay of Biscay. Between August and September she entered the HM Dockyard at Devonport where her aircraft facilities were removed and additional 20 mm weapons were installed in order to improve her air defences. Her radar was improved by fitting a new Fire- Control Type 283. The opportunity was also taken to install IFF equipment and VHF radio-telephone outfits. Upon completion of her refit she was transferred to join the Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth. In October. On 26 October she took to sea the First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham to undertake the interment of the ashes of Admiral Sir Dudley Pound and his late wife in the Solent, off Nab Tower. In December 1943 she formed part of Operation Stonewall, (the interception of blockade runners). In late December, Glasgow and the cruiser in the Battle of the Bay of Biscay fought a three-hour battle with eleven German destroyers and torpedo boats of which three were sunk and four damaged by gunfire. After this engagement Glasgow returned to Plymouth in spite of several air raids where glider bombs were used. On 6 June 1944 Glasgow was part of Operation Neptune, (the Normandy landings). Along with the battleships and , the French cruisers and , nine US destroyers and three s, she made up the Gunfire Bombardment Support Force C for Omaha Beach. On 25‚Äì26 June, in support of the attack by the 7th US Corps on Cherbourg, she shelled the German batteries near Querqueville. During this exchange of fire Glasgow was hit and damaged. In August 1945 she set sail for the East Indies, where she was the flagship of the Commander-in-Chief. = Modernisation = With the demand for cruisers in the European theatre decreasing it was decided to withdraw Glasgow and modernise her in preparation for the ongoing war in the Pacific. Entering a shipyard on the River Tyne on 3 July 1944 her aft 6-inch turret ('X') was removed to compensate for the additional weight of adding the more powerful anti-aircraft armament needed to counter the threat of kamikaze attacks. The space freed by the removal of the aft turret was used to mount two quad 40 mm Bofors guns. New radar systems were fitted including a single aerial air warning Type 281B (which replaced an earlier twin mast Type 281), a surface warning Type 293 (which replaced the existing Type 273), while the main armament's Type 284 gunnery radar was replaced by a Type 274. She was also fitted with a US made YE homing beacon to help her undertake the high risk role of a radar picket. The beacon issued coded directions to Allied aircraft returning from missions, which would allow Glasgow to be stationed on an outer screen around the main fleet to separate Allied aircraft from accompanying enemy aircraft and so destroy enemy aircraft before they reached the fleet. The modernisation was completed on 29 June 1945. She then spent July working up for operational war service. = Postwar = Mountbatten arrives on board HMS Glasgow at Malta to assume command of the Mediterranean Fleet, 16 May 1952 On 22 August 1945 Glasgow set out with HMS Jamaica for the East Indies as acting flagship. she transferred to the Indian Ocean arriving in Colombo on 5 October to relieve HMS Phoebe as the flagship of 5th Cruiser Squadron. After serving for two years in the Indian Ocean Glasgow returned to Portsmouth and was placed in the Reserve. Following a refit she was re- commissioned in September 1948 and deployed to the America and West Indies Station, where she was the flagship. She attended the Halifax bicentenary celebrations in Nova Scotia in 1949, returning to the UK in October 1950. She was then refitted at Chatham in 1951 before becoming in 1952 the flagship of the Mediterranean Fleet based at Malta under Admiral the Earl Mountbatten of Burma. In 1953, she took part in the film Sailor of the King. In the same year she took part in the Fleet Review to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.Souvenir Programme, Coronation Review of the Fleet, Spithead, 15th June 1953, HMSO, Gale and Polden Together with , HMS Bermuda, HMS Eagle, seven destroyers and two frigates she escorted Queen Elizabeth II and Duke of Edinburgh on board the royal yacht Britannia at the end of their world tour to Malta where they arrived on 2 May 1954. She was still in the Mediterranean Fleet when together with HMS Gambia she participated in August 1954 in the withdrawal of the 40th Brigade of the Royal Marine Commandos from Port Said. In 1955 Glasgow returned to the UK, and in May 1955 onwards rejoined the Home Fleet as flagship of the Flag Officer D (Flotillas) before being paid off at Portsmouth in November 1956. The Suez crisis in 1956 caused Glasgow to be temporarily re-commissioned. = Decommissioning and disposal = Post the Suez Crisis it was decided that Glasgow was surplus to requirements and was paid off in November 1956 the warship was placed on the disposal list in March 1958 and was sold to BISCO for demolition. Departing Portsmouth on 4 July Glasgow arrived under tow on 8 July at Hughes Bolckow's yard in Blyth for breaking up.

Brown California Aqueduct is a system of canals, tunnels, and pipelines that conveys water collected from the Sierra Nevada Mountains and valleys of Northern and Central California to Southern California. Named after California Governor Edmund Gerald \\"Pat\\" Brown Sr., the over aqueduct is the principal feature of the California State Water Project. The aqueduct begins at the Clifton Court Forebay at the southwestern corner of the Sacramento‚ÄìSan Joaquin River Delta. The aqueduct then heads south, eventually splitting into three branches: the Coastal Branch, ending at Lake Cachuma in Santa Barbara County; the West Branch, conveying water to Castaic Lake in Los Angeles County; and the East Branch, connecting Silverwood Lake in San Bernardino County. The Department of Water Resources (DWR) operates and maintains the California Aqueduct, including one pumped-storage hydroelectric plant, Gianelli Power Plant. Gianelli is located at the base of San Luis Dam, which forms San Luis Reservoir, the largest offstream reservoir in the United States. The Castaic Power Plant, while similar and which is owned and operated by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, is located on the northern end of Castaic Lake, while Castaic Dam is located at the southern end. The aqueduct system The aqueduct begins at the San Joaquin-Sacramento River Delta at the Banks Pumping Plant, which pumps from the Clifton Court Forebay. Water is pumped by the Banks Pumping Plant to the Bethany Reservoir. The reservoir serves as a forebay for the South Bay Aqueduct via the South Bay Pumping Plant. From the Bethany Reservoir, the aqueduct flows by gravity approximately to the O'Neill Forebay at the San Luis Reservoir. From the O'Neill Forebay, it flows approximately to the Dos Amigos Pumping Plant. After Dos Amigos, the aqueduct flows about to where the Coastal Branch splits from the \\"main line\\". The split is approximately south-southeast of Kettleman City. After the coastal branch, the line continues by gravity another to the Buena Vista Pumping Plant. From the Buena Vista, it flows approximately to the Teerink Pumping Plant. After Teerink it flows about to the Chrisman Pumping Plant. Chrisman is the last pumping plant before Edmonston Pumping Plant, which is from Chrisman. South of the plant the west branch splits off in a southwesterly direction to serve the Los Angeles Basin. At Edmonston Pumping Plant it is pumped over the Tehachapi Mountains. Water flows through the aqueduct in a series of abrupt rises and gradual falls. The water flows down a long segment, built at a slight grade, and arrives at a pumping station powered by Path 66 or Path 15. The pumping station raises the water, where it again gradually flows downhill to the next station. However, where there are substantial drops, the water's potential energy is recaptured by hydroelectric plants. The initial pumping station fed by the Sacramento River Delta raises the water , while a series of pumps culminating at the Edmonston Pumping Plant raises the water over the Tehachapi Mountains. The Edmonston Pumping station requires so much power that several power lines off of Path 15 and Path 26 are needed to ensure proper operation of the pumps. A typical section has a concrete-lined channel at the base and an average water depth of about . The widest section of the aqueduct is and the deepest is . Channel capacity is and the largest pumping plant capacity at Dos Amigos is . Branches From its beginning until its first branch, the aqueduct passes through parts of Contra Costa, Alameda, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Merced, Fresno, and Kings counties. The aqueduct then divides into three branches: the Coastal Branch in the Central Valley, and the East and West Branches after passing over the Tehachapi Mountains. Aqueduct and surrounding farms in Kern County =Coastal Branch= The Coastal Branch splits from the main line south-southeast of Kettleman City transiting Kings County, Kern County, San Luis Obispo County, and Santa Barbara County to deliver water to the coastal cities of San Luis Obispo, Santa Maria, and Santa Barbara. Coastal Branch is and five pump stations. Phase I, an above ground aqueduct totals from where it branches from the California Aqueduct, was completed in 1968. With construction beginning in 1994, Phase II consists of of a diameter buried pipeline extending from the Devils Den Pump Plant, and terminates at Tank 5 on Vandenberg Air Force Base in Santa Barbara County. The Central Coast Water Authority (CCWA) extension, completed in 1997, is a (30‚Äì39 in) (76‚Äì99 cm) diameter pipeline that travels from Vandenberg through Vandenberg Village, Lompoc, Buellton, and Solvang where it terminates at Lake Cachuma in Los Padres National Forest.

Their impact on the California Aqueduct is both direct and indirect. The Sacramento River, along with its tributaries the Feather River and American River, flows southwards through the Sacramento Valley for about . In the San Joaquin Valley, the San Joaquin River flows roughly northwest for , picking up tributaries such as the Merced River, Tuolumne River, Stanislaus River and Mokelumne River. In the south part of the San Joaquin Valley, the alluvial fan of the Kings River and another one from Coast Ranges streams have created a divide and resultantly the currently dry Tulare basin of the Central Valley, into which flow four major Sierra Nevada rivers, the Kings, Kaweah, Tule and Kern. This basin, usually endorheic, formerly filled during heavy snowmelt and spilled out into the San Joaquin River. Called Tulare Lake, it is usually dry nowadays because the rivers feeding it have been diverted for agricultural purposes. The rivers of the Central Valley converge in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, a complex network of marshy channels, distributaries and sloughs that wind around islands mainly used for agriculture. Here the freshwater of the rivers merges with tidewater, and eventually reach the Pacific Ocean after passing through Suisun Bay, San Pablo Bay, upper San Francisco Bay and finally the Golden Gate. Many of the islands now lie below sea level because of intensive agriculture, and have a high risk of flooding, which would cause salt water to rush back into the delta, especially when there is too little fresh water flowing in from the Valley. The Sacramento River carries far more water than the San Joaquin, with an estimated of virgin annual runoff, as compared to the San Joaquin's approximately . Intensive agricultural and municipal water consumption has reduced the present rate of outflow to about for the Sacramento and for the San Joaquin; however, these figures still vary widely from year to year. Over 25 million people, living both in the valley and in other regions of the state, rely on the water carried by these rivers.  In popular culture  A documentary about the decline of the United States' infrastructure, The Crumbling of America, was commissioned by the U.S. A&E; network in the late 2000s. The documentary is typically shown on the History television channel in the United States, although other educational broadcasters globally have shown it. It features the Clifton Court Forebay (a primary intake point for California Aqueduct) as a \\"strategic piece of California freshwater infrastructure\\" subject to shutdown for up to two years if struck by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 or greater.

Biscayne Bay () is a lagoon that is approximately long and up to wide located on the Atlantic coast of South Florida, United States. It is usually divided for purposes of discussion and analysis into three parts: North Bay, Central Bay, and South Bay. Its area is . The drainage basin covers . Geography The North Bay of the Biscayne Bay lies between Miami Beach barrier island and Miami on the mainland. It has been severely affected over the last century by raw sewage releases, urban runoff, shoreline bulkheading, dredging, the creation of artificial islands and the loss of natural fresh water flow into the bay. However, water quality has steadily improved since regular monitoring began in 1979. North Bay accounts for only 10% of the water area of the bay. Central Bay is the largest part of the bay. It is separated from the Atlantic Ocean by the Safety Valve. It has been adversely affected primarily by bulkheading, urban runoff discharged by canals, and the loss of natural fresh water flow. South Bay is nearly as large as Central Bay, and is the least affected by human activities, although it also suffers from the loss of natural fresh water flow. South Bay is separated from the Straits of Florida by the northernmost of the Florida Keys, and includes Card Sound and Barnes Sound. It is connected to Florida Bay through a few small channels. The bay is also home to the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science in Virginia Key (founded in 1947) and Florida International University's Biscayne Bay Campus (founded in 1977) in North Miami. It was seen in the music video for The Lonely Island's \\"I'm on a Boat\\". History and nomenclature The bay has been known by several names. Juan Ponce de Le√≥n called it Chequescha in 1513. Pedro Men√©ndez de Avil√©s called it Tequesta in 1565. The British, during their occupation of Florida, called the bay Cape River, Dartmouth Sound, and Sandwich gulph. Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda related that a sailor from the Bay of Biscay called the Viscayno or Biscayno had lived on the lower east coast of Florida for a while after being shipwrecked, and a 17th-century map shows a Cayo de Biscainhos, the probable origin of Key Biscayne. The bay was known as Key Biscayne Bay in the 19th century, finally shrinking to Biscayne Bay late in the 19th century.Blank, Joan Gill. 1996. Key Biscayne. Sarasota, Florida: Pineapple Press, Inc. . p. 13. Causeways The first bridge across Biscayne Bay was the wooden Collins Bridge built in 1912 by John S. Collins and his son-in-law Thomas Pancoast, who formed the Miami Beach Improvement Corporation; financing was provided by Carl G. Fisher and the Miami banker brothers John N. Lummus and James E. Lummus.Blank, p. 159.Whitaker, p. 133. Construction began on July 22, 1912. Although the cost of the project was initially $75,000, the construction project faced delays and cost overruns. The bridge was partially completed in 1913. The bridge was \\"hailed as the longest wooden vehicle bridge in the world, and opened up the area as a luxury winter resort and playground.\\" The bridge terminated at the Dixie Highway, built by Carl G. Fisher.Reilly, p. 200. The bridge was a toll bridge; in 1920, the toll was reduced from 20 cents each way (for two-seat cars) to 15 cents one way (and 25 cents round- trip).Reilly, p. 33. The bridge was sold to the Biscayne Bay Improvement Association, which developed five artificial islands that became known as the Venetian Islands: Biscayne and San Marco in Miami, San Marino, Di Lido, and Rivo Alto in Miami Beach. Reilly, p. 33-34.Klepser, p. 24. The bridge was torn down in 1925 and replaced with the \\"more substantial\\" Venetian Causeway the next year. The Lummus brothers lobbied for the county commission's support for a second causeway connecting Miami to the barrier islands of Miami Beach, and the County Causeway--later the MacArthur Causeway--opened on February 17, 1920.Bramson, p. 8. In 1925, Biscayne Point was created in Miami Beach's north end. In 1929, a third causeway crossed Biscayne Bay at Normandy Isle, which developer Henri Levy had created several years earlier by dredging and filling the south half of Meade Island. The Julia Tuttle Causeway was built in 1959. Other causeways are the John F. Kennedy (79th Street) and Broad causeways (connecting the Miami mainland), and the Rickenbacker Causeway (connecting Miami to Key Biscayne). The Card Sound Bridge connects the mainland in the Homestead, Florida area to the northern part of Key Largo. Wildlife and preservation In 1975, the bay was designated as a state aquatic preserve. The aquatic preserve spans the entirety of Biscayne Bay from Oleta River in the north to Card Sound in the south, with the exception of the central part of the bay, which is Biscayne National Park. A second preserve was soon added off of Cape Florida on Key Biscayne, which became known as the Cape Florida to Monroe County Line Preserve. These two preserves are now managed by the state of Florida under the Biscayne Bay Aquatic Preserves. Seven remaining houses of Biscayne Bay's Stiltsville settlement are now within the boundaries of this National Park which was established in 1980. Much of Biscayne National Park was designated as a National Monument in 1967. Barnes Sound lies within the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. In regards to wildlife, bottlenose dolphins and Florida manatees can be observed in the bay. In August 2020 the depletion of dissolved Oxygen in the waters Biscayne Bay triggered a fish- kill. Fish that had suffocated were floating to the surface. Authorities took the emergency measure of dispatching fireboats to aerate the water, by spraying the water high into the air with their water cannons. Safety Valve Aerial view of the Safety Valve from southern end of Key Biscayne (top) to Soldier Key The Safety Valve is a series of shallow sand flats separated by tidal flow channels, stretching about from the south end of Key Biscayne to the Ragged Keys at the north end of the Florida Keys. The term \\"safety valve\\" was applied to the tidal flats by Ralph Munroe, who argued against building a causeway and bridges connecting Key Biscayne to the Ragged Keys and beyond on the grounds that such construction would block the free outflow of storm surges from the bay across the flats to the ocean. It is believed that it does moderate the effects of storm surges on the bay. The transportation of sand southward along the Atlantic Coast of Florida by longshore drift ends in the area of the Safety Valve. The structure of the Safety Valve has been stable for at least the last century. Stiltsville is a collection of buildings on pilings on several sand flats at the northern end of the Safety Valve.

Originally ten stories and tall, it was designed by William Le Baron Jenney in 1884 and completed the next year. Two floors were added in 1891, bringing it to . It is frequently noted as the first tall building to be supported both inside and outside by a fireproof structural steel and metal frame, which included reinforced concrete. It is thus often considered the world's first skyscraper, although this is disputed. The building opened in 1885 and was demolished 46 years later in 1931. History The building was designed in 1884 by Jenney for the Home Insurance Company of New York. Construction began on May 1, 1884. Because of the building's unique architecture and weight-bearing frame, it is considered one of the world's first skyscrapers. It had 10 stories and rose to a height of ; two floors were added in 1891. The building weighed one-third as much as a masonry building and city officials were so concerned they halted construction while they investigated its safety. =Demolition and replacement= In April 1929 the building was reported as having a 90 percent occupancy rate, compared to an occupancy rate of the surrounding financial district estimated at at least 96 percent. In September 1929 plans were made by Marshall Field's to construct a large office building spanning Adams, Clark, and LaSalle Streets. This building would be constructed and opened in parts, the first part occupying the western part of the lot and the site of the Home Insurance Building. All told six buildings were demolished to make way for the Field Building, including the Home Insurance Building. In 1932, owners placed a plaque in the southwest section of the lobby reading: Status as first skyscraper The Home Insurance Building is often considered the first skyscraper, although this status is disputed. Its main claim to that status is as the first tall building supported by an iron frame as a skeleton. It was the first multistory building in the United States to largely use iron in its exterior to support the masonry since Badger had constructed similar grain elevators between 1860 and 1862. The status of the Home Insurance Building as the first skyscraper had been accorded by the time of its centennial in 1985. The Chicago press at the time of its construction did not refer to it as the first skyscraper in Chicago. An 1884 list of buildings considered skyscrapers in Chicago listed three buildings whose final heights would be taller than the Home Insurance Building's. Iron framing of multistory buildings had originated in England in the late 18th century and was able to replace exterior load-bearing walls by 1844, although social movements and legal regulations hindered their use at that time. An example is the Ditherington Flax Mill, which is nevertheless only five stories tall. The Broad Street Station in Philadelphia, a six-story building designed by Wilson Brothers & Company built in 1881, had a structural steel frame and was one of the first buildings in America to use masonry not as structure, but as curtain wall. It was later greatly expanded by Frank Furness.George E. Thomas, \\"Broad Street Station,\\" in James F. O'Gorman et al., Drawing Toward Building: Philadelphia Architectural Graphics, 1732‚Äì1986 (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1986), pp. 140‚Äì42. In the United States iron framing had been developed in New York in the 1850s but was not fireproof. The buildings in Chicago were able to solve this problem, supporting the external masonry entirely on the iron frame. Peter B. Wright had constructed such a column in Chicago in 1874. Leroy Buffington of Minneapolis developed a system of using wrought iron to frame buildings and had it patented in 1888. It has been argued by critics of the Home Insurance Building that its fame originated in an attempt to defeat Buffington's patent. Other candidates for first skyscraper include the 1882 Montauk Building also in Chicago and the 1870 Equitable Life Building in New York. The concept of a \\"first skyscraper\\" has itself been criticized for being too narrow and poorly reflecting the nuances of urban architectural history.

From a full-sized reproduction on display at the Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum, San Jose. Thutmose IV was born to Amenhotep II and Tiaa, but was not actually the crown prince and Amenhotep II's chosen successor to the throne. Some scholars speculate that Thutmose ousted his older brother in order to usurp power and then commissioned the Dream Stele in order to justify his unexpected kingship. Thutmose's most celebrated accomplishment was the restoration of the Great Sphinx of Giza and subsequent commission of the Dream Stele. According to Thutmose's account on the Dream Stele, while the young prince was out on a hunting trip, he stopped to rest under the head of the Sphinx, which was buried up to the neck in sand. He soon fell asleep and had a dream in which the Sphinx told him that if he cleared away the sand and restored it he would become the next pharaoh. After completing the restoration of the Sphinx, he placed a carved stone tablet, now known as the Dream Stele, between the two paws of the Sphinx. The restoration of the Sphinx, and the text of the Dream Stele would then be a piece of propaganda on Thutmose's part, meant to bestow legitimacy upon his unexpected kingship.Peter Clayton, Chronicle of the Pharaohs, Thames & Hudson Ltd, 1994. pp.113-114 Syrian (\\"Retjenu\\") tribute bearers in the tomb of Sobekhotep, during the reign of Thutmose IV, Thebes. British Museum Little is known about his brief ten-year rule. He suppressed a minor uprising in Nubia in his 8th year (attested in his Konosso stela) around 1393 BC and was referred to in a stela as the Conqueror of Syria, but little else has been pieced together about his military exploits. Betsy Bryan, who penned a biography of Thutmose IV, says that Thutmose IV's Konosso stela appears to refer to a minor desert patrol action on the part of the king's forces to protect certain gold-mine routes in Egypt's Eastern Desert from occasional attacks by the Nubians. Thutmose IV's rule is significant because he established peaceful relations with Mitanni and married a Mitannian princess to seal this new alliance. Thutmose IV's role in initiating contact with Egypt's former rival, Mitanni, is documented by Amarna letter EA 29 composed decades later by Tushratta, a Mittanian king who ruled during the reign of Akhenaten, Thutmose IV's grandson. Tushratta states to Akhenaten that: Dates and length of reign Thutmose IV wearing the khepresh, Mus√©e du Louvre.

The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London Dating the beginning of the reign of Thutmose IV is difficult to do with certainty because he is several generations removed from the astronomical dates which are usually used to calculate Egyptian chronologies, and the debate over the proper interpretation of these observances has not been settled. Thutmose's grandfather Thutmose III almost certainly acceded the throne in either 1504 or 1479, based upon two lunar observances during his reign, and ruled for nearly 54 years.Peter Der Manuelian.

The length of his reign is not as clear as one would wish. He is usually given about nine or ten years of reign. Manetho credits him a reign of 9 years and 8 months. However, Manetho's other figures for the 18th Dynasty are frequently assigned to the wrong kings or simply incorrect, so monumental evidence is also used to determine his reign length. Of all of Thutmose IV's dated monuments, three date to his first regnal year, one to his fourth, possibly one to his fifth, one to his sixth, two to his seventh, and one to his eighth. Two other dated objects, one dated to a Year 19 and another year 20, have been suggested as possibly belonging to him, but neither have been accepted as dating to his reign. The readings of the king's name in these dates are today accepted as referring to the prenomen of Thutmose III‚ÄîMenkheperre‚Äîand not Menkhepe[ru]re Thutmose IV himself. Due to the absence of higher dates for Thutmose IV after his Year 8 Konosso stela,BAR II, 823-829 Manetho's figures here are usually accepted. There were once chronological reconstructions which gave him a reign as long as 34‚Äì35 years.Wente, E.F.; and Van Siclen, C. \\"A Chronology of the New Kingdom.\\" SAOC 39 Today, however, most scholars ascribe him a 10-year reign from 1401 to 1391 BC, within a small margin of error. Monuments Thutmose IV's Karnak chapel Thutmose IV's peristyle hall at Karnak Like most of the Thutmoside kings, he built on a grand scale. Thutmose IV completed the eastern obelisk at the Temple of Karnak started by Thutmose III, which, at , was the tallest obelisk ever erected in Egypt. Thutmose IV called it the tekhen waty or 'unique obelisk.' It was transported to the grounds of the Circus Maximus in Rome by Emperor Constantius II in 357 AD and, later, \\"re-erected by Pope Sixtus V in 1588 at the Piazza San Giovanni\\" where it is today known as the Lateran Obelisk.Nicolas Grimal, A History of Ancient Egypt, Blackwell Books, 1992. p.303 Thutmose IV also built a unique chapel and peristyle hall against the back or eastern walls of the main Karnak temple building. The chapel was intended for people \\"who had no right of access to the main [Karnak] temple. It was a 'place of the ear' for the god Amun where the god could hear the prayers of the townspeople.\\" This small alabaster chapel and peristyle hall of Thutmose IVAccessible online in the Karnak project database: http://www.cfeetk.cnrs.fr/karnak/?iu=2775&hl;=en has today been carefully restored by French scholars from the Centre Franco-Egyptien D'√âtude des Temple de Karnak (CFEETK) mission in Karnak.Al-Ahram, Fruitful seasons, 21‚Äì27 November 2002, Issue No.613  Burial and mummy  Thutmose IV's mummy. Thutmose IV was buried in tomb KV43 the Valley of the Kings but his body was later moved to the mummy cache in KV35, where it was discovered by Victor Loret in 1898. An examination of his mummy conducted by Grafton Elliot Smith revealed that he was extremely emaciated at the time of his death. His height was given as but considering that the feet have been broken off post-mortem, his height in life would have been taller. The forearms are crossed over the chest, right over left. His hair, which is parted in the middle, is about long and dark reddish-brown. His ears are also pierced. Elliot Smith estimated his age to be 25‚Äì28 years or possibly older. He was succeeded to the throne by his son, Amenhotep III. Recently a surgeon at Imperial College London analysed the early death of Thutmose IV and the premature deaths of other Eighteenth Dynasty pharaohs (including Tutankhamun and Akhenaten). He concludes that their early deaths were likely as a result of a familial temporal epilepsy. This would account for both the untimely death of Thutmose IV and also his religious vision described on the Dream Stele, due to this type of epilepsy's association with intense spiritual visions and religiosity.

The tholos tomb, located on \\"Kafkala\\" hill, was accidentally revealed and then looted at the beginning of the 20th century. During World War II a bomb caused the partial destruction of its roof and the backfill of the chamber. It is a significant funerary monument excavated in 1966 by the curator Mr. C. Davaras and partly restored in 1970. It dates back to the Late Minoan III A-B era (14th-13th c. B.C.). A corridor (\\"dromos\\"), 25.10m long and 1.60m wide, leads to the chamber. A step in the middle separates the dromos into two parts. The walls are coated with coarse stones, while a slim layer of reddish mortar covered its floor. There is a large lintel over the entrance to the chamber (2m high and 1.60m wide) and a relieving triangle, open to the chamber and covered with a slab on the front. The stone threshold bears two sockets for the reception of pivots of a wooden gate. The chamber was finally blocked with a stone walling. The burial chamber, very carefully built with large porous stones, square in ground plan (4.36m x 4.46m), should have ended in a pyramidal roof. Its floor consisted of pebbles knitted together with lime mortar, while parts of the walls were coated with ivory-coloured mortar. Just two seal stones have been preserved among the grave goods, one made of copper, the other made of agate, together with some pot fragments.

In 1866, the crested gecko was described by a French zoologist named Alphone Guichenot. This species was thought extinct until it was rediscovered in 1994 during an expedition led by Robert Seipp. Along with several Rhacodactylus species, it is being considered for protected status by the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna. It is popular in the pet trade. Taxonomy The species was first described in 1866 as Correlophus ciliatus by the French zoologist Alphone Guichenot in an article entitled \\"Notice sur un nouveau genre de sauriens de la famille des geckotiens du Mus√©um de Paris\\" (\\"Notes on a new species of lizard in the gecko family\\") in the M√©moires de la Soci√©t√© Scientifique Naturelle de Ch√©rbourg. It was later renamed Rhacodactylus ciliatus. Recent phylogenetic analysis indicates that R. ciliatus and R. sarasinorum are not closely related to the other giant geckos, so these two species have been moved back to the genus Correlophus. The specific name, ciliatus, is Latin, from cilia (\\"fringe\\" or \\"eyelashes\\") and refers to the crest of skin over the animal's eyes that resembles eyelashes. Physical description This captive crested gecko has a tricolor extreme harlequin pattern that is not found in the wild. Crested geckos are among the largest gecko species and typically range from in length, including of tail length. Among the most distinctive features of these geckos are the hair-like projections found above the eyes, which greatly resemble eyelashes. Crested geckos also have two rows of spines that run from the sides of their wedge- shaped head to the base of their tail. Crested geckos do not have eyelids and so they use their long tongues to moisten their eyes and remove debris. The toes and the tip of the semi-prehensile tail are covered in small hairs called setae. Each seta is divided into hundreds of smaller (approximately 200 nanometres in diameter) hairs called spatulae. It is believed these structures exploit the weak van der Waals force to help the gecko climb on most solid surfaces. The toes have small claws which aid in climbing surfaces to which their toes cannot cling. They possess a semi-prehensile tail which they use to assist in climbing. The tail can be dropped (via caudal autotomy) as a deterrent to predators. Unlike some other geckos, once they lose their tail, it will not grow back; however, this is not as harmful to the gecko as it is in other species, such as the leopard gecko, which store fat reserves in their tails. In fact, most adults in the wild lack tails. The crested gecko has many naturally occurring color groups, including grey, brown, red, orange, and yellow of various shades. They have three color morphs in the wild, which include pattern-less, white-fringed, and tiger. Breeders of the species have achieved many other patterns such as the extreme harlequin pattern that are not observed in the wild. The crested gecko has distinct structural morphs in head size and crest abundance. Geckos with a head length less than 1.3 times its width are considered \\"crowned\\". The numbers and sizes of crests can vary; some geckos have crests that extend to the base of the tail and some lack crests on one side of their body.  Geographic distribution  A tailless New Caledonian crested gecko The crested gecko is endemic to South Province, New Caledonia. There are three disjunct populations, one found on the Isle of Pines and surrounding islets, and there are two populations found on the main island of Grande Terre. One population is around the Blue River, which is a protected provincial park, and the other is further north, just south of Mount Dzumac. Ecology and behavior Jumping crested gecko A captive crested gecko cleaning its eyes. Crested geckos do not have eyelids. Instead, a transparent scale, or spectacle, keeps each eye moist, and the geckos use their tongues to clear away debris. Like the closely related Rhacodactylus geckos, crested geckos have webbed legs and digits. They are a mostly arboreal species, preferring to inhabit the canopy of the New Caledonian rainforests, and because of this they can jump considerably well. They are primarily nocturnal, and will generally spend the daylight hours sleeping in secure spots in high branches. Crested geckos are, however, less strong climbers than tokay gecko. Crested geckos shed their skin up to once a week when young. When fully grown, the process only occurs once every one or two months. The crested gecko ‚Äì unlike the closely related gargoyle gecko (Rhacodactylus auriculatus) ‚Äì will not regrow its tail once lost. The cells around the base of the tail are brittle, allowing the tail to break away when threatened or caught by a predator. The capillaries to the tail will close almost instantly, so there is little to no blood loss. The tails will move independently of the body for 2‚Äì5 minutes. The loss of their tail is not problematic, and most adults in the wild do not have their tails. Unlike most species of gecko, this species is an omnivore, also considered frugivorous, feeding on fruit, nectar, pollen, and a variety of insects.http://www.moonvalleyreptiles.com/crested-geckos/diet- nutrition In captivity, they should be fed a commercially prepared, fruit- based diet with live feeder insects as a supplement. An unbalanced diet containing insufficient calcium can quickly lead to metabolic bone disease (MBD). Captivity Juvenile female crested gecko Though the export of wild crested geckos is now prohibited, biologists exported several specimens for breeding and study before New Caledonia stopped issuing permits to export the species. From these specimens, different breeding lines were established both in Europe and the United States. The crested gecko is now one of the most widely-kept and bred species of gecko in the world. Baby crested gecko eating a cricket These geckos can be very long-lived. While they have not been kept in captivity long enough for a definitive life span to be determination, they have been kept for 15‚Äì20 years or more. They can be kept healthy on specially prepared powdered fruit diets with sufficient calcium or a variety of insects dusted with calcium or multivitamin supplements. Reproduction Crested geckos mating Little is known about the wild reproductive behavior of crested geckos, but in captivity they breed readily, with the female laying two eggs, which hatch 60‚Äì150 days after they are laid. Eggs are generally laid at four week intervals as long as the fat and calcium reserves of the female are still at healthy levels. Crested geckos have two small sacs for calcium on the roof of their mouths. If an egg-laying female does not have enough calcium her sac will be depleted, and she can suffer from calcium deficiency. This can lead to a calcium crash, where the female appears shaky or wobbly, lethargic, has a lack of appetite, and can even result in death. Eggs laid by a female whose calcium reserves are low occasionally exhibit signs of congenital metabolic bone disease, such as an underbite and/or a kinked or wavy tail. It is currently unknown whether heat plays a role in determining the sex of the embryo, as it can with other gecko species. Newly hatched crested geckos will generally not eat until after they have shed and eaten their skin for the first time, relying on the remains of their yolk sack for nutrition. A female crested only has to mate with a male once in order to lay 2 eggs every 4‚Äì6 weeks for upwards of 8‚Äì10 months. Sperm retention ensures that the eggs the female lays will remain fertile throughout her breeding cycle. After those 8‚Äì10 months, females in the wild go through a \\"cooling\\" cycle, usually prompted by slight temperature and daylight changes over the winter season. During this time, the females are able to regain the body mass and nutrients they lost during egg-laying. This cooling cycle must be implemented in captivity or females will lay eggs continuously, resulting in calcium depletion, poor health, and even death. Although there is no confirmed cases of asexual reproduction in crested geckos, there has been claims of females laying eggs with no sexual activity with a male. Status in the wild Long believed extinct, the species was rediscovered in 1994 after a tropical storm. It is currently being assessed for CITES protection and vulnerable status.Fox, Rebecca (10 March 2013) Greater protection sought for geckos. The New Zealand Herald. The biggest single threat to the wild population appears to be the introduction of the little fire ant (Wassmania auropunctata) to New Caledonia. The ants prey on the geckos, stinging and attacking in great numbers, and they also compete with the geckos for food by preying on arthropods.

The most familiar example is the completeness of the real numbers. A special use of the term refers to complete partial orders or complete lattices. However, many other interesting notions of completeness exist. The motivation for considering completeness properties derives from the great importance of suprema (least upper bounds, joins, \\"\\\\vee\\") and infima (greatest lower bounds, meets, \\"\\\\wedge\\") to the theory of partial orders. Finding a supremum means to single out one distinguished least element from the set of upper bounds. On the one hand, these special elements often embody certain concrete properties that are interesting for the given application (such as being the least common multiple of a set of numbers or the union of a collection of sets). On the other hand, the knowledge that certain types of subsets are guaranteed to have suprema or infima enables us to consider the computation of these elements as total operations on a partially ordered set. For this reason, posets with certain completeness properties can often be described as algebraic structures of a certain kind. In addition, studying the properties of the newly obtained operations yields further interesting subjects. Types of completeness properties All completeness properties are described along a similar scheme: one describes a certain class of subsets of a partially ordered set that are required to have a supremum or required to have an infimum. Hence every completeness property has its dual, obtained by inverting the order-dependent definitions in the given statement. Some of the notions are usually not dualized while others may be self-dual (i.e. equivalent to their dual statements). =Least and greatest elements= The easiest example of a supremum is the empty one, i.e. the supremum of the empty set. By definition, this is the least element among all elements that are greater than each member of the empty set. But this is just the least element of the whole poset, if it has one, since the empty subset of a poset P is conventionally considered to be both bounded from above and from below, with every element of P being both an upper and lower bound of the empty subset. Other common names for the least element are bottom and zero (0). The dual notion, the empty lower bound, is the greatest element, top, or unit (1). Posets that have a bottom are sometimes called pointed, while posets with a top are called unital or topped. An order that has both a least and a greatest element is bounded. However, this should not be confused with the notion of bounded completeness given below. =Finite completeness= Further simple completeness conditions arise from the consideration of all non-empty finite sets. An order in which all non-empty finite sets have both a supremum and an infimum is called a lattice. It suffices to require that all suprema and infima of two elements exist to obtain all non-empty finite ones. A straightforward induction shows that every finite non-empty supremum/infimum can be decomposed into a finite number of binary suprema/infima. Thus the central operations of lattices are binary suprema \\\\vee and infima It is in this context that the terms meet for \\\\wedge and join for \\\\vee are most common. A poset in which only non-empty finite suprema are known to exist is therefore called a join-semilattice. The dual notion is meet-semilattice. =Further completeness conditions= The strongest form of completeness is the existence of all suprema and all infima. The posets with this property are the complete lattices. However, using the given order, one can restrict to further classes of (possibly infinite) subsets, that do not yield this strong completeness at once. If all directed subsets of a poset have a supremum, then the order is a directed-complete partial order (dcpo). These are especially important in domain theory. The seldom-considered dual notion to a dcpo is the filtered- complete poset. Dcpos with a least element (\\"pointed dcpos\\") are one of the possible meanings of the phrase complete partial order (cpo). If every subset that has some upper bounds has also a least upper bound, then the respective poset is called bounded complete. The term is used widely with this definition that focuses on suprema and there is no common name for the dual property. However, bounded completeness can be expressed in terms of other completeness conditions that are easily dualized (see below). Although concepts with the names \\"complete\\" and \\"bounded\\" were already defined, confusion is unlikely to occur since one would rarely speak of a \\"bounded complete poset\\" when meaning a \\"bounded cpo\\" (which is just a \\"cpo with greatest element\\"). Likewise, \\"bounded complete lattice\\" is almost unambiguous, since one would not state the boundedness property for complete lattices, where it is implied anyway. Also note that the empty set usually has upper bounds (if the poset is non- empty) and thus a bounded-complete poset has a least element. One may also consider the subsets of a poset which are totally ordered, i.e. the chains. If all chains have a supremum, the order is called chain complete. Again, this concept is rarely needed in the dual form. Relationships between completeness properties It was already observed that binary meets/joins yield all non-empty finite meets/joins. Likewise, many other (combinations) of the above conditions are equivalent. * The best-known example is the existence of all suprema, which is in fact equivalent to the existence of all infima, provided a bottom exists. Indeed, for any subset X of a poset, one can consider its set of lower bounds B, which is not empty since it contains at least the bottom. The supremum of B is then equal to the infimum of X: since each element of X is an upper bound of B, sup B is smaller than all elements of X, i.e. sup B is in B. It is the greatest element of B and hence the infimum of X. In a dual way, the existence of all infima implies the existence of all suprema. * Bounded completeness can also be characterized differently. By an argument similar to the above, one finds that the supremum of a set with upper bounds is the infimum of the set of upper bounds. Consequently, bounded completeness is equivalent to the existence of all non-empty infima. * A poset is a complete lattice if and only if it is a cpo and a join-semilattice. Indeed, for any subset X, the set of all finite suprema (joins) of X is directed and the supremum of this set (which exists by directed completeness) is equal to the supremum of X. Thus every set has a supremum and by the above observation we have a complete lattice. The other direction of the proof is trivial. * The following equivalence requires the axiom of choice: :: A poset is chain complete if and only if it is a dcpo. Completeness in terms of universal algebra As explained above, the presence of certain completeness conditions allows to regard the formation of certain suprema and infima as total operations of an ordered set. It turns out that in many cases it is possible to characterize completeness solely by considering appropriate algebraic structures in the sense of universal algebra, which are equipped with operations like \\\\vee or \\\\wedge. By imposing additional conditions (in form of suitable identities) on these operations, one can then indeed derive the underlying partial order exclusively from such algebraic structures. Details on this characterization can be found in the articles on the \\"lattice- like\\" structures for which this is typically considered: see semilattice, lattice, Heyting algebra, and Boolean algebra. Note that the latter two structures extend the application of these principles beyond mere completeness requirements by introducing an additional operation of negation. Completeness in terms of adjunctions Another interesting way to characterize completeness properties is provided through the concept of (monotone) Galois connections, i.e. adjunctions between partial orders. In fact this approach offers additional insights both into the nature of many completeness properties and into the importance of Galois connections for order theory. The general observation on which this reformulation of completeness is based is that the construction of certain suprema or infima provides left or right adjoint parts of suitable Galois connections. Consider a partially ordered set (X, ‚â§). As a first simple example, let 1 = {*} be a specified one-element set with the only possible partial ordering. There is an obvious mapping j: X ‚Üí 1 with j(x) = * for all x in X. X has a least element if and only if the function j has a lower adjoint j*: 1 ‚Üí X. Indeed the definition for Galois connections yields that in this case j*(*) ‚â§ x if and only if * ‚â§ j(x), where the right hand side obviously holds for any x. Dually, the existence of an upper adjoint for j is equivalent to X having a greatest element. Another simple mapping is the function q: X ‚Üí X x X given by q(x) = (x, x). Naturally, the intended ordering relation for X x X is just the usual product order. q has a lower adjoint q* if and only if all binary joins in X exist. Conversely, the join operation \\\\vee: X x X ‚Üí X can always provide the (necessarily unique) lower adjoint for q. Dually, q allows for an upper adjoint if and only if X has all binary meets. Thus the meet operation \\\\wedge, if it exists, always is an upper adjoint. If both \\\\vee and \\\\wedge exist and, in addition, \\\\wedge is also a lower adjoint, then the poset X is a Heyting algebra‚Äîanother important special class of partial orders. Further completeness statements can be obtained by exploiting suitable completion procedures. For example, it is well known that the collection of all lower sets of a poset X, ordered by subset inclusion, yields a complete lattice D(X) (the downset-lattice). Furthermore, there is an obvious embedding e: X ‚Üí D(X) that maps each element x of X to its principal ideal {y in X  y ‚â§ x}. A little reflection now shows that e has a lower adjoint if and only if X is a complete lattice. In fact, this lower adjoint will map any lower set of X to its supremum in X. Composing this with the function that maps any subset of X to its lower closure (again an adjunction for the inclusion of lower sets in the powerset), one obtains the usual supremum map from the powerset 2X to X. As before, another important situation occurs whenever this supremum map is also an upper adjoint: in this case the complete lattice X is constructively completely distributive. See also the articles on complete distributivity and distributivity (order theory). The considerations in this section suggest a reformulation of (parts of) order theory in terms of category theory, where properties are usually expressed by referring to the relationships (morphisms, more specifically: adjunctions) between objects, instead of considering their internal structure. For more detailed considerations of this relationship see the article on the categorical formulation of order theory.

A fire eating trick performed at a bar in New York City A set of simple cast iron fire eating torches Video of fire eating. Fire eating is the act of putting a flaming object into the mouth and extinguishing it. A fire eater can be an entertainer, a street performer, part of a sideshow or a circus act but has also been part of spiritual tradition in India. Physics and hazards Fire eating relies on the quick extinction of the fire in the mouth or on the touched surfaces and on the short term cooling effects of water evaporation at the surface on the source of fire (usually with a low percentage of alcohol mixed in the water) or saliva in the mouth. This allows for igniting a damp handkerchief or a bill of money without it burning. Closing the mouth, or covering it with a slap of the hand cuts off the oxygen to the fire. Blowing on it can remove the very thin area of reaction from the source of fuel, and thus extinguish the fire in some cases, where the blown air is faster than the fire front and the flame is small enough to be entirely removed.Why alcohol burns and does not ignite in Classic Chemistry Demonstrations published by the Royal Society of Chemistry. (Google Books)Why does a candle blow out when we blow on it? (Answer on Stack Exchange physics questions site) The flame itself is not a cold flame, and the performers do not use any other material besides the fuel. Certain materials are avoided when doing the trick, such as materials which may easily ignite, melt or store the heat and release it later. These include paraffin candles, plastic, and thick multithreaded rope.Fire eating instructions including instructions repeatedly stressing the importance of an attending experienced skilled master, and giving instructions as to the recommended materials to be used. (juggling.org website) According to Daniel Mannix's 1951 sideshow memoir Step right up!, the real \\"secret\\" to fire eating is enduring pain; he mentions that tolerating constant blisters on your tongue, lips and throat is also necessary. Many other fire eaters dismiss this, claiming that skilled fire eaters should not burn themselves. The most common method of safely performing fire eating acts relies on the fact that it takes time to transfer heat, and that heat rises in air. Fire eating and fire breathing (and all variants) is a skill which should be passed on from a skilled master to an appropriate student and almost all teachings include instructions on first aid, fire safety, chemistry and other appropriate skills.Safety for Fire Eating and Contact Fire (Retrieved from the MIT students portal) Accidental ingestion of fuel or improper technique can lead to a serious condition known as fire eater's pneumonia. History Fire eating was a common part of Hindu, Sadhu, and Fakir performances to show spiritual attainment. It became a part of the standard sideshow acts in the late 1880s and was often seen as one of the entry-level skills for sideshow performers,Blitz' book of magic and fire eating made easy, Library of Congress catalog first published in 1880. (Following a series of books published since 1875) A famous fire eater from the 18th century was Robert Powell who allegedly not only swallowed fire but also red-hot coals, melted sealing wax and even brimstone. He performed, often in front of British and other European royalty and nobility, for nearly sixty years and, in 1751, was awarded a purse of gold and a large silver medal.Miracle Mongers and their Methods, Houdini: particularly chapters II, V, VI .

They were distinct from another pre-Hellenic people of the region, the Pelasgians. The exact areas to which they were native are uncertain, since they were apparently pre-literate and the only references to them are in ancient Greek sources. These references are casual and (it is alleged) sometimes fictitious. Likewise, little is known about the language of the Leleges. Many Greek authors link the Leleges to the Carians of south-west Anatolia. Homer names the Leleges among the Trojan allies alongside the Carians, Pelasgians, Paeonians and Gaucones. Etymology It is thought that the name Leleges is an exonym, in a long-extinct language, rather than an endonym (or autonym). That is, during the Bronze Age the word lulahi apparently meaning \\"strangers\\" was used in the Luwian language and in other Anatolian languages. For example, in a Hittite cuneiform inscription, priests and temple servants are directed to avoid conversing with lulahi and foreign merchants. According to the suggestion of Vitaly Shevoroshkin, an attempt to transliterate lulahi into Greek might result in leleges. Late traditions reported in Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheke, and by Pausanias, derive the name from an eponymous king Lelex; a comparable etymology, memorializing a legendary founder, is provided by Greek mythographers for virtually every tribe of Hellenes: \\"Lelex and the Leleges, whatever their historical significance, have acted as a blank sheet on which to draw Lakonia and all it means,\\" observes Ken Dowden.  Ancient sources on Leleges  =Anatolia= In Homer's Iliad, the Leleges are allies of the Trojans (10.429), though they do not appear in the formal catalogue of allies in Book II of the Iliad, and their homeland is not specified. They are distinguished from the Carians, with whom some later writers confused them; they have a king, Altes, and a city Pedasus which was sacked by Achilles. The topographical name \\"Pedasus\\" occurs in several ancient places: near Cyzicus, in the Troad on the Satniois River, in Caria, as well as in Messenia, according to Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 1911. Gargara in the Troad was counted as Lelegian. Alcaeus (7th or 6th century BCE) calls Antandrus in the Troad \\"Lelegian\\", but later Herodotus substitutes the epithet \\"Pelasgian\\", so perhaps the two designations were broadly synonymous for the Greeks. According to Homer, the Leleges were a distinct Anatolian tribe. However, Herodotus states that Leleges had been an early name for the Carians. Pherecydes of Athens (ca 480 BC) attributed to the Leleges the coast land of Caria, from Ephesus to Phocaea, with the islands of Samos and Chios, placing the true Carians farther south from Ephesus to Miletus. Pausanias was reminded that the temple of the goddess at Ephesus predated the Ionian colony there, when it was rededicated to the goddess as Artemis. He states with certainty that it antedated the Ionic immigration by many years, being older even than the oracular shrine at Dodona. He says that the pre-Ionic inhabitants of the city were Leleges and Lydians (with a predominance of the latter) and that, although Androclus drove out of the land all those whom he found in the upper city, he did not interfere with those who dwelt about the sanctuary. By giving and receiving pledges he put these on a footing of neutrality. These remarks of Pausanias find confirmation in the form of the cult in historic times, centering on a many-breasted icon of the \\"Lady of Ephesus\\" whom Greeks called Artemis. Other cult aspects, being in all essentials non-Hellenic, suggest the indigenous cult was taken over by the Greek settlers. The Lady of Ephesus, 1st century AD, Ephesus Archaeological Museum Often historians assume, as a general rule, that autochthonous inhabitants survive an invasion as an under-class where they do not retreat to mountain districts, so it is interesting to hear in Deipnosophistae that Philippus of Theangela (a 4th-century BC historian) referred to Leleges still surviving as serfs of the \\"true Carians\\", and even later Strabo attributes to the Leleges a distinctive group of deserted forts and tombs in Caria that were still known in his day as \\"Lelegean forts\\"; the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 1911 identified these as ruins that could still be traced ranging from the neighborhood of Theangela and Halicarnassus as far north as Miletus, the southern limit of the \\"true Carians\\" of Pherecydes. Plutarch also implies the historic existence of Lelegian serfs at Tralles (now Aydin) in the interior. =Greece and the Aegean= The fourth-century BC historian Philippus of Theangela suggested that the Leleges maintained connections to Messenia, Laconia, Locris and other regions in mainland Greece, after they were overcome by the Carians in Asia Minor. A single passage in the fragmentary Hesiodic Catalogue of WomenCat. fr. 234. places \\"Leleges\\" in Deucalion's mythicized and archaic time in Locris in central Greece. Locris is also the refuge of some of the Pelasgian inhabitants forced from Boeotia by Cadmus and his Phoenician adventurers. But not until the 4th century BCE does any other writer place Leleges anywhere west of the Aegean. But the confusion of the Leleges with the Carians (immigrant conquerors akin to Lydians and Mysians) which first appears in a Cretan legend (quoted by Herodotus, but repudiated, as he says, by the Carians themselves) and is repeated by Callisthenes, Apollodorus and other later writers, led easily to the suggestion of Callisthenes, that Leleges joined the Carians in their (half legendary) raids on the coasts of Greece. Herodotus (1.171) says that the Leleges were a people who in old times dwelt in the islands of the Aegean and were subject to Minos of Crete (one of the historic references that led Sir Arthur Evans to name the pre-Hellenic Cretan culture \\"Minoan\\"); and that they were driven from their homes by the Dorians and Ionians, after which they took refuge in Caria and were named Carians. Herodotus was a Dorian Greek born in Caria himself. Meanwhile, other writers from the 4th century onwards claimed to discover them in Boeotia, west Acarnania (Leucas), and later again in Thessaly, Euboea, Megara, Lacedaemon and Messenia. In Messenia, they were reputed to have been immigrant founders of Pylos, and were connected with the seafaring Taphians and Teleboans, and distinguished from the Pelasgians. However, in Lacedaemon and in Leucas they were believed to be aboriginal and Dionysius of Halicarnassus mentions that Leleges is the old name for the later Locrians. These European Leleges must be interpreted in connection with the recurrence of place names like Pedasus, Physcus, Larymna and Abae, both in Caria, and in these \\"Lelegian\\" parts of Greece. Perhaps this is the result of some early migration; perhaps it is also the cause of these Lelegian theories; perhaps there was a widespread pre-Indo- European culture that loosely linked these regions, a possibility on which much modern hypothesis has been constructed. Germanic theorists of the 19th century who inspired modern heirs: *H. Kiepert. \\"√úber den Volksstamm der Leleges\\", (in Monatsberichte Berliner Akademie, 1861, p. 114) asserted that the Leleges were an aboriginal people and linked them to Illyrians. *K. W. Deimling. Die Leleger (Leipzig, 1862), places their origins in southwest Asia Minor, and brings them thence to Greece, essentially repeating the classical Greek view. *G. F. Unger. \\"Hellas in Thessalien,\\" in Philologus, supplement. ii. (1863), made them Phoenician. *E. Curtius. History of Greece, (vol. i) even distinguished a \\"Lelegian\\" phase of nascent Aegean culture.

In the APG IV classification system, it is placed in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Nolinoideae (formerly the family Ruscaceae). It has also formerly been separated (sometimes with Cordyline) into the family Dracaenaceae or placed in the Agavaceae (now Agavoideae). The name dracaena is derived from the romanized form of the Ancient Greek ‚Äì drakaina, \\"female dragon\\". The majority of the species are native to Africa, southern Asia through to northern Australia, with two species in tropical Central America. The segregate genus Pleomele is now generally included in Dracaena. The genus Sansevieria is closely related, and has recently been synonymized under Dracaena in the Kubitzki system. Description Species of Dracaena have a secondary thickening meristem in their trunk, termed Dracaenoid thickening by some authors, which is quite different from the thickening meristem found in dicotyledonous plants. This characteristic is shared with members of the Agavoideae and Xanthorrhoeoideae among other members of the Asparagales. Dracaena species can be classified in two growth types: treelike dracaenas (Dracaena fragrans, Dracaena draco, Dracaena cinnabari), which have aboveground stems with a single cluster of leaves at the end of each stem and rhizomatous dracaenas (Dracaena trifasciata, Dracaena angolensis), which have underground rhizomes and leaves on the surface (ranging from straplike and moderately thin to thick and cylindrical). Many species of Dracaena are kept as houseplants due to tolerance of lower light and sparse watering. File:Socotra dragon tree.JPGDracaena cinnabari File:Dracaena draco (L.)

Tormentilla erecta, Potentilla laeta, Potentilla tormentilla, known as the (common) tormentil, septfoilSeptfoil - definition of Septfoil by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia or erect cinquefoil ) is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the rose family (Rosaceae). Description Potentilla erecta is a low, clump-forming plant with slender, procumbent to arcuately upright stalks, growing tall and with non-rooting runners. It grows wild predominantly in Europe and western Asia, mostly on acid soils and in a wide variety of habitats such as mountains, heaths, meadows, sandy soils and dunes. This plant flowers from May to August/September. There is one yellow, wide flower, growing at the tip of a long stalk. There are almost always four notched petals, each between 3 and 6 mm long. Four petals are rather uncommon in the rose family. The petals are somewhat longer than the sepals. There are 20‚Äì25 stamens. The radical leaves have a long petiole, whilst the leaves on the flowering stalks are usually sessile or with short petioles. The glossy leaves are alternate, ternate, consisting of three obovate leaflets with serrated margins. The paired stipules are leaflike and palmately lobed. There are 2‚Äì8 dry, inedible fruits. Rhizome of Potentilla erecta Distribution =Europe= Potentilla erecta is found wild throughout Europe, Scandinavia and West Asia. Potentilla erecta is almost ubiquitous in the British Isles, recorded in almost all 10 km squares except close to the Wash. and is listed as a species of least concern. It is very common in grasslands, heaths, moors and mountains, bogs including roadsides and pastures, mostly on acidic soils but avoiding chalk. It is a component of British National Vegetation Classification community M25 (Molinia caerulea‚ÄìPotentilla erecta mire). =North America= In North America Potentilla erecta is found in the east as an introduced species. Uses The rhizomatous root is thick. It has little value for food use because of its bitterness and low caloric value. The roots are a main ingredient of a bitter liqueur from Bavaria and the Black Forest area, called Blutwurz. It is also used in Ukraine along with honey in Horilka. The plant is used in herbal medicine as an astringent because of its tannin content, which is unusually high for a herbaceous plant. Structurally-related phlobaphenes, used as a red dye for leather known as tormentil red, can be extracted from the root of the common tormentil along with the triterpene alcohol tormentiol. Aqueous extracts of the rhizomes are reported to have low toxicity in rats and mice.

A sea cucumber also looks slug- like and is sometimes loosely called a \\"sea slug\\", but it is not a gastropod. Sea slug is a common name for some marine invertebrates with varying levels of resemblance to terrestrial slugs. Most creatures known as sea slugs are actually gastropods, i.e. they are sea snails (marine gastropod mollusks) that over evolutionary time have either completely lost their shells, or have seemingly lost their shells due to having a greatly reduced or internal shell. The name \\"sea slug\\" is most often applied to nudibranchs, as well as to a paraphyletic set of other marine gastropods without obvious shells.Thompson, T. E. 1976. Biology of opisthobranch molluscs, vol. 1, 207 pp., 21 pls. Ray Society, no. 151. Sea slugs have an enormous variation in body shape, color, and size. Most are partially translucent. The often bright colors of reef- dwelling species implies that these are under constant threat of predators, but the color can serve as a warning to other animals of the sea slug's toxic stinging cells or offensive taste. Like all gastropods, they have small razor- sharp teeth, called radulas. Most sea slugs have two pairs of tentacles on their head used primarily for sense of smell, with a small eye at the base of each tentacle. Many have feathery structures (cerata) on the back, often in a contrasting color, which act as gills. All species of genuine sea slugs have a selected prey animal on which they specialize for food, including certain jellyfish, bryozoans, sea anemones, and plankton as well as other species of sea slugs.Byatt, Andrew, Alastair Fothergill, and Martha Holmes. The Blue Planet: A Natural History of the Oceans. New York, NY: DK, 2001. Print. sea slugs\\"sea slug\\". The Columbia Encyclopedia, 6th ed.. 2015. Encyclopedia.com. 10 Nov. 2015. Shell-less marine gastropods The name \\"sea slug\\" is often applied to numerous different evolutionary lineages of marine gastropod molluscs or sea snails, specifically those gastropods that are either not conchiferous (shell-bearing) or appear not to be. In evolutionary terms, losing the shell altogether, having a small internal shell, or having a shell so small that the soft parts of the animal cannot retract into it, are all features that have evolved many times independently within the class Gastropoda, on land and in the sea; these features often cause a gastropod to end up labeled with the common name \\"slug\\". The nudibranch Glossodoris atromarginata Nudibranchs (clade Nudibranchia) are a large group of marine gastropods which have no shell at all. These may be the most familiar sort of sea slug, at least to scuba divers; nudibranchs, although most are not large, are often very eye-catching because so many of species have brilliant coloration. In addition to nudibranchs, a number of other taxa of marine gastropods (some easily mistaken for nudibranchs) are also often called \\"sea slugs\\".Thompson, T. E., & Brown, G.H., 1984. Biology of opisthobranch Molluscs. Vol. 2. Ray Society; London. 1-229, p.49 =Gastropod groups= Within the various groups of gastropods that are called \\"sea slugs\\" numerous families are within the informal taxonomic group Opisthobranchia: :The phrase \\"sea slug\\" is perhaps most often applied to nudibranchs, many of which are brightly patterned and conspicuously ornate. :For two examples see the images of Nembrotha aurea and Glossodoris atromarginata within this article. :The name \\"sea slug\\" is also often applied to the sacoglossans (clade Sacoglossa), the so-called sap-sucking or solar-powered sea slugs; these are frequently some shade of green. The sacoglossan Elysia crispata The cephalaspidean Chelidonura varians :Another group of main gastropods that are often labeled as \\"sea slugs\\" are the various families of headshield slugs and bubble snails within the clade Cephalaspidea. The sea hare Aplysia dactylomela, photographed out of water :The sea hares, clade Aplysiomorpha, have a small, flat, proteinaceous internal shell. :The clades Thecosomata and Gymnosomata are small pelagic gastropods known as \\"sea butterflies\\" and \\"sea angels\\". Many species of sea butterflies retain their shells. These are commonly known as \\"pteropods\\" but are also sometimes called sea slugs; especially the Gymnosomata, which have no shell as adults. There is also one group of \\"sea slugs\\" within the informal group Pulmonata: The marine pulmonate Onchidella celtica :One very unusual group of marine gastropods that are shell-less are the pulmonate (air-breathing) species in the family Onchidiidae, within the clade Systellommatophora. Diversity in sea slugs Like many nudibranchs, Glaucus atlanticus can store and use stinging cells from its prey (Portuguese man o' war) in its finger-like cerata. Other species like the Pyjama slug Chromodoris quadricolor may use their striking colors to advertise their foul chemical taste. The lettuce sea slug (Elysia crispata) has lettuce-like ruffles that line its body. This slug, like other Sacoglossa uses kleptoplasty, a process in which the slug absorbs chloroplasts from the algae it eats, and uses \\"stolen\\" cells to photosynthesize sugars. The ruffles of the lettuce sea slug increase the slug's surface area, allowing the cells to absorb more light. Headshield slugs like the Chelidonura varians use their shovel-shaped heads to dig into the sand, where they spend most of their time. The shield also protects sand from entering the mantle during burrowing. The largest species of sea hare, the California black sea hare, Aplysia vaccaria can reach a length of 75 centimetres (30 in) and a weight of 14 kilograms (31 lb). Most sea hares have several defenses; in addition to being naturally toxic, they can eject a foul ink or secrete a viscous slime to deter predators. Some species of acochlidian sea slugs have made evolutionary transitions to living in freshwater streams and there is at least one evolutionary transition to land.

Brought to the United States with South Korean immigrants, it is celebrated in its native land for its strong loyalty and bravery. The Jindo breed became recognized by the United Kennel Club on January 1, 1998United Kennel Club breed recognition. and by the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale in 2005. Description =Appearance= Jindos are double-coated spitz-type dogs. Distinguishing the Jindo breed from mongrel and other breeds is often done by close examination of cranial and facial features and by analyzing the proportion of the head to the body. In addition, the breed exhibits sexual dimorphism with females having more angular heads than males. The keen and alert appearance of the Jindo gives the impression of intelligence, strength, loyalty, and agility. Other features include forward- pointing upright ears and a double coat. Body Korean Jindo owners have traditionally divided Jindos into two body types: * Tonggol or Gyeopgae: This type is more muscular and stocky with the Korean National Dog Association (KNDA) recognizing an equal proportion of height at the withers to length (10:10). The depth of chest is approximately equal to one-half the height at the withers. The loin is also typically shorter. * Hudu or Hotgae: This type is more slender with a somewhat less depth of chest and a slightly longer loin. Moreover, other physical features tend to have an increased length, such as the ears, muzzle, and head. This results in an appearance that is longer than tall with the KNDA recommending a height at the withers to length ratio of 10:11. The KNDA also recognizes a third body type called Gakgol which is a gradually emerging combination of the two traditional types, retaining the length of body of the Hudu and the depth of chest of the Tonggol. In regards to the Jindo's body appearance, the United Kennel Club currently states, \\"The squarely built Jindo has a chest that is moderately deep but not too broad. At its deepest point the chest reaches to, or just above, the elbow. The brisket is well developed and the ribs are well sprung. The back is strong and straight and the loin is well muscled, taut, lean and narrower than the ribcage. There is considerable tuck up.\\" Color Jindos come in five colors: * White (baekgu) - This color is actually an off-white or ivory shade with tan or light brown around the tips of the ears, the back of the hind legs, and the tip of the tail. Some whites may have a subtle tan stripe running from the head, down the top line, to the tail. * Fawn (hwanggu) - The color of well-ripened wheat. * Grey (heukgu) - This coat looks gray from a distance but is actually made up of individual white, black, and fawn colored hairs. * Black and tan (Naenunbagi) - Black head and upper body with tan on the muzzle, belly, and paws, and an eye-shaped tan spot over each eye. * Brindle (beulindeul) - Also known as \\"Tiger\\" pattern. Thin, dark brown or black stripes like a tiger's on a fawn base. These stripes appear at an early age. Some Jindo Island residents value black, black/red, and red/white Jindos as good hunters. The United Kennel Club recognizes six different coat colors: white, red fawn, wolf grey, black, black and tan, and brindle (tiger pattern). =Feet= The feet are of medium size, round in shape, with thick, strong tan pads. Nails are hard and may be black, cream or gray. =Gait= * The Jindo moves with strides of moderate length. * It is a quick, light, elastic trot which enables the Jindo to travel quickly over any terrain. * The forelegs and hind legs are carried straight forward, with neither elbows nor stifles turned in or out. * At a normal walking speed, the Jindo tends to lower its head. Head * The top skull of an adult dog should be broad and rounded between the ears and free from wrinkles. * The under jaw is well-developed and helps give a round or octagonal shape to the head when viewed from the front. Coarse hairs stand away from the cheeks. * The ears are triangular and upright (leaning forward past vertical). The inside of the ears should be well-furred. Ears on puppies normally lie flat until they are past 5‚Äì6 months. * The eyes are almond/round. They should be a shade of brown (a dark reddish-brown being preferred). Some dogs have light brown eyes but this color is not desirable. Jindos should not have blue eyes. * The nose should be black on non-white dogs. White dogs may have mottled portions of tan or pink in the center of the nose. * The muzzle is well proportioned without being bulky. The lips should be taut and black. The preferred color for the tongue is solid pink. * The Jindo has a complete set of evenly spaced, white teeth with a scissors bite. * Typically, males have larger heads and females have more fox-like features. =Height and weight= Desirable height at maturity, measured at the withers, ranges from 19¬Ω to 21 inches (or 48 to 53 cm) for males and 18¬Ω to 20 inches (or 45 to 50 cm) for females. Weight should be in proportion to the height, giving a well-muscled, lean appearance without being too light or too heavy. The typical weight range for a male Jindo in good condition is 40 to 60 pounds (18 to 27 kg); for a female, 35 to 55 pounds (16 to 25 kg). =Tail= The tail is thick and strong and set on at the end of the top line. The tail should be at least long enough to reach to the hock joint. The tail may be loosely curled over the back or carried over the back in a sickle position. The hair on the underside of the tail is thick, stiff, abundant, and twice as long as the coat on the shoulders, which causes the hair to fan outward when the tail is up. Character Baekgu () Jindo dogs are well known for their loyalty and gentle nature. Since Jindo dogs are active, they need proper living space, walks, care, and attention. There is also a clear perception of family hierarchy. They are of medium to high energy. If kept in a yard, the fencing must be at least 6 feet high due to their strong hind legs that enable them to jump high. Because Jindos are active and intelligent, they require frequent interaction with people or other dogs. Hwanggu () The Korean Army is known to use Jindos as guard dogs at major bases. Many Jindos do not take food from anyone other than their owners. Many Koreans consider Jindo Dogs as 'gatekeepers,' loosely tied up near the front gate of the house in rural areas. History There is no written record of the origin of the Korean Jindo Dog. Authorities agree that the Jindos existed on Jindo Island for a long time. One theory proposes the Jindo as cross-breeds with Mongolian dogs when Mongol forces invaded Korea around the 13th century. They are now protected under the Cultural Properties Protection Act.History of Jindo Dog from Jindo Dog Research and Testing Center In 1962, the Government of South Korea designated the Jindo as the 53rd 'Natural Treasure' (or translated as 'Natural Monument') (Ï≤úÏó∞Í∏∞ÎÖêÎ¨º; Â§©ÁÑ∂Ë®òÂøµÁâ©)Jindo profile, Korean Cultural Heritage site and passed the Jindo Preservation Ordinance. Because of the special status of the Jindo, it is very difficult to export purebred Jindo outside of Korea. Jindos marched in the opening ceremonies of the 1988 Summer Olympic Games in Seoul, Korea. The United Kennel Club recognized the Jindo on January 1, 1998. The Jindo Dogs Guild of Korea (), as of 2008, issues certificates of pure Korean Jindo Dog, which specifies the registered number of the mother, sex, and birth date of the dog, as well as breeder's address and whether the dog is of purebred. The breed first appeared in the West in France and a small number have since been introduced to the United Kingdom and the United States. As of 2016, there were only two registered Jindos in the U.S.: one in the Los Angeles area and one in Seattle. There were 25 registered in the United Kingdom. =Hunting= The Jindo are renowned for their outstanding hunting ability, due to their courage, cunning, and pack sensibility. Besides the usual prey of medium to large game, their hunting prowess is displayed in a legend of three Jindos that killed a Siberian tiger. They have mainly been used as deer and boar hunters. There have been anecdotal reports of Korean owners being awakened by their Jindo one morning to be led deep into the forest to a deer the dog had taken down alone. There have also been reported cases in America of intruding coyotes being killed by Jindos defending their territory. In traditional Korean hunting without guns, a pack of well trained Jindos was extremely valuable. A master with a loyal pack could hunt without much trouble at all, for when the pack brings down a deer, boar or other target, one of them returns to the master to lead him to the prey, while the others stand guard against scavengers. =As police and military dogs= In a 2009 interview with Korea Economic Daily (ÌïúÍµ≠Í≤ΩÏ†ú), Park Nam-sun (Î∞ïÎÇ®Ïàú), an expert search dog handler in South Korea, testified that Jindo dogs are not fit as rescue dogs and search dogs. It is because Jindo dogs' hunting instincts are too strong (they can forget their mission because of their hunting instincts), and they usually give their loyalty only to the first owner, while handlers of search dogs and rescue dogs can frequently change. In 2010, Son Min-suk (ÏÜêÎØºÏÑù), a member of Korean Security Forum, wrote that most of Korean military dogs were German Shepherds, and that Jindo dogs were not fit for military dogs as they were highly likely to escape their duties to find their first handlers who might be discharged from military services, or to come back to their original home. However, efforts to train Jindo dogs as search and rescue dogs continue. In October 2010, the Los Angeles Police Department announced their intent to evaluate the Jindo dog breed for law enforcement service, specifically for patrol and detection service. Four selected Jindo puppies would be distributed to LAPD and Glendale California Police Department to be trained as K9 units. After a year of trying, the trainers found that the dogs did not have the right disposition for police work because they were too easily distracted and too eager to please their masters.Glionna, James M., \\"LAPD finds South Korean Jindo dogs not up to snuff\\", Los Angeles Times November 13, 2011 =Anecdotes on loyalty of Jindos= In 1993, a 7-year-old female Jindo named Baekgu (Î∞±Íµ¨; ÁôΩÁãó; translated as a White Dog), raised by Park Bok-dan (Î∞ïÎ≥µÎã®), an 83-year-old woman on Jindo Island, was sold to a new owner in the city of Daejeon which is located about 300 km (180 mi) away from the island. The dog escaped her new home and returned to her original owner, Park, after 7 months, haggard and exhausted. Baekgu remained with her original owner, who decided to keep the loyal dog, until the dog died of natural causes 7 years later. The story was a national sensation in South Korea and was made into cartoons, a TV documentary, and a children's storybook.Song, J. (1997). ÎèåÏïÑÏò® ÏßÑÎèóÍ∞ú Î∞±Íµ¨ [Return of Baekgu the Jindo dog]. Seoul, Korea: Daegyo. In 2004, Jindo County erected a statue of Baekgu in her hometown to honor the dog. Another Jindo, also named Baekgu, a 4-year-old male at the time who lived alone with his owner Park Wan-suh (Î∞ïÏôÑÏÑú) residing on Jindo Island, did not eat anything and mourned for his dead owner for seven days after the owner died from a liver disease in June 2000. According to Chosun Ilbo, the dog accompanied his dead owner for three days until other people came to find the body, followed the owner to his funeral, and came back home, not eating anything for four days. The Korean Jindo Dog Research Institute (ÏßÑÎèóÍ∞ú ÏãúÌóòÏó∞Íµ¨ÏÜå) brought him under its care, but a person related to the Institute announced that the dog would not interact with anyone except for his feeder as of 2005.

The red resin has been in continuous use since ancient times as varnish, medicine, incense, and dye.  Name and source  Dracaena draco leaves showing dragon's blood pigment at the base A great degree of confusion existed for the ancients in regard to the source and identity of dragon's blood. Some medieval encyclopedias claimed its source as the literal blood of elephants and dragons who had perished in mortal combat.De Hamel, Christopher. Scribes and Illuminators.Medieval Craftsmen series. Toronto: U Toronto P,1992. Print. 62. The resin of Dracaena species, \\"true\\" dragon's blood, and the very poisonous mineral cinnabar (mercury sulfide) were often confused by the ancient Romans. In ancient China, little or no distinction was made among the types of dragon's blood from the different species. Both Dracaena and Daemonorops resins are still often marketed today as dragon's blood, with little or no distinction being made between the plant sources; however, the resin obtained from Daemonorops has become the most commonly sold type in modern times, often in the form of large balls of resin. Voyagers to the Canary Islands in the 15th century obtained dragon's blood as dried garnet-red drops from Dracaena draco, a tree native to the Canary Islands and Morocco. The resin is exuded from its wounded trunk or branches. Dragon's blood is also obtained by the same method from Dracaena cinnabari, which is endemic to the island of Socotra. This resin was traded to ancient Europe via the Incense Road. Dragon's blood resin is also produced from the rattan palms of the genus Daemonorops of the Indonesian islands and known there as jernang or djernang. It is gathered by breaking off the layer of red resin encasing the unripe fruit of the rattan. The collected resin is then rolled into solid balls before being sold. The red latex of the Sangre de Drago, aka Sangre de Grado, tree (at least seven species of Croton native to Peru, Ecuador and Brazil), has purported wound-healing and antioxidant properties, and has been used for centuries by native people.Meza, E.N. 1999.  Uses  The dragon's blood known to the ancient Romans was mostly collected from D. cinnabari, and is mentioned in the 1st century Periplus (30: 10. 17) as one of the products of Socotra. Socotra had been an important trading centre since at least the time of the Ptolemies. Dragon's blood was used as a dye, painting pigment, and medicine (respiratory and gastrointestinal problems) in the Mediterranean basin, and was held by early Greeks, Romans, and Arabs to have medicinal properties. Dioscorides and other early Greek writers described its medicinal uses.Casson, L. 1989. The Periplus Maris Erythraei. Princeton University Press, pp. 69, 168-170. . Locals of Moomy city on Socotra island use the Dracaena resin as a sort of cure-all, using it for such things as general wound healing, a coagulant (though this is ill-advised with commercial products, as the Daemonorops species acts as an anti-coagulant and it is usually unknown what species the dragon's blood came from), curing diarrhea, lowering fevers, dysentery diseases, taken internally for ulcers in the mouth, throat, intestines and stomach, as well as an antiviral for respiratory viruses, stomach viruses and for skin disorders such as eczema. It was also used in medieval ritual magic and alchemy. Dragon's blood of both Dracaena draco (commonly referred to as the Draconis Palm) and Dracaena cinnabari were used as a source of varnish for 18th century Italian violinmakers. There was also an 18th-century recipe for toothpaste that contained dragon's blood. In modern times it is still used as a varnish for violins, in photoengraving, as an incense resin, and as a body oil. Dragon's blood from both Daemonorops were used for ceremonies in India. Sometimes Dracaena resin, but more often Daemonorops resin, was used in China as red varnish for wooden furniture. It was also used to colour the surface of writing paper for banners and posters, used especially for weddings and for Chinese New Year. In American Hoodoo, African-American folk magic, and New Orleans voodoo, it is used in mojo hands for money-drawing or love-drawing, and is used as incense to cleanse a space of negative entities or influences. It is also added to red ink to make \\"Dragon's Blood Ink\\", which is used to inscribe magical seals and talismans. In folk medicine, dragon's blood is used externally as a wash to promote healing of wounds and to stop bleeding. It is used internally for chest pains, post-partum bleeding, internal traumas and menstrual irregularities. In neopagan Witchcraft, it is used to increase the potency of spells for protection, love, banishing and sexuality. In New Age shamanism it is used in ceremonies in a similar way as the neopagans use it. Dragon's blood incense is also occasionally sold as \\"red rock opium\\" to unsuspecting would-be drug buyers. It actually contains no opiates, and has only slight psychoactive effects, if any at all. Thaspine from the Dragon's Blood of the species Croton lechleri has possible use as a cancer drug.  Safety  A study on oral toxicity of the DC resin methanol extract taken from the perennial tree Dracaena cinnabari was performed on female Sprague Dawley rats in February 2018. Acute and sub-acute oral toxicity tests found that the extract could be tolerated up to 2,000 mg/kg body weight.

This reflex causes the sea hare's delicate siphon and gill to be retracted when the animal is disturbed.Carew, T. J. (2000). Behavioral Neurobiology: The Cellular Organization of Natural Behavior. Sinauer Associates, Inc. Aplysia californica is used in neuroscience research for studies of the cellular basis of behavior including: habituation, dishabituation, and sensitization, because of the simplicity and relatively large size of the underlying neural circuitry. Eric Kandel, recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2000 for his work with Aplysia californica, was involved in pioneering research into this reflex in the 1960s and 1970s. Nonassociative learning Nonassociative learning is a change of the behavior of an animal due to an experience from specific kinds of stimuli. In contrast to associative learning the behavioral change is not caused by the animals learning that a particular temporal association occurs between the stimuli. There are three different forms of nonassociative learning examined in Aplysia: habituation, dishabituation and sensitization. Eric Kandel and colleagues were the first to demonstrate that Aplysia californica is capable of displaying both habituation and dishabituation. Habituation in Aplysia californica occurs when a stimulus is repeatedly presented to an animal and there is a progressive decrease in response to that particular stimulus. Dishabituation in Aplysia californica occurs when the animal is presented with another novel stimulus and a partial or complete restoration of a habituated response occurs. Sensitization in Aplysia californica is the increase of a response due to the presentation of a novel, often noxious, stimulus. Gill and siphon withdrawal reflex (GSWR) A two-component reflex is triggered when a weak or moderate stimulus is applied to the siphon or the mantle shelf. These two components consist of two reflex acts, the siphon-withdrawal reflex and the gill-withdrawal reflex. Together they form a reflex pattern with short latency which protects the animal's gill and siphon from potentially threatening stimuli.Kandel, E. R. (1976). Cellular Basis of Behavior, an introduction to behavioral neurobiology. W. H. Freeman and Company. Both central ganglia and peripheral neurons are often involved in the neural control of behavior in molluscs. In molluscs such as Aplysia californica the peripheral motor neurons are more extensive, as opposed to vertebrates, and innervate somatic (locomotor and appendageal) muscles. Central pathways are activated by weak stimuli applied at some distance from the target effector structure and peripheral pathways are activated when the stimuli is applied at a distance or directly on the target effector structure. A stimulus to the siphon (weak or moderate) is mediated by abdominal ganglion (55%) and by peripheral motor neurons (45%) and is activated simultaneously. By using preparations of Aplysia californica six central motor neurons have been found in the abdominal ganglion that produce movements of the gill. Stimulation of the cells named L7, LDG1, LDG2 and RDG results in large gill contractions and stimulation of L9G1 and L9G2 produces smaller contractions. In the abdominal ganglion has seven central motor neurons been found that also produce movements of the siphon. LDS1, LDS2, LDS3, RDS, LBS1, LBS2, and LBS3 control contraction and constriction of the siphon. The siphon is additionally innervated by about 30 peripheral motor neurons. Kandel and colleagues used preparations of Aplysia californica where individuals were restrained in small aquariums in a manner that the gill was exposed. A tactile stimulus was administered to the siphon and elicited the gill and siphon withdrawal reflex. A photocell was placed under the gill to record amplitude and duration of the response elicited by the stimulus. Habituation was observed when the stimulus was delivered repeatedly to the siphon. Stimulus every 90 seconds resulted in a rapidly declined response. By delivering an electric shock to the tail the response was rapidly restored, and dishabituation occurred. Sensitization was observed when a strong stimulus was administered to the tail, thus enhancing a completely rested reflex in Aplysia californica.

The dynasty was named after Grand Prince √Årp√°d who was the head of the Hungarian tribal federation during the conquest of the Carpathian Basin, c. 895\\\\. It is also referred to as the Turul dynasty, but rarely. Both the first Grand Prince of the Hungarians (√Ålmos) and the first king of Hungary (Saint Stephen) were members of the dynasty. Seven members of the dynasty were canonized or beatified by the Roman Catholic Church; therefore, since the 13th century the dynasty has often been referred to as the \\"Kindred of the Holy Kings\\". Two √Årp√°ds were recognized as Saints by the Eastern Orthodox Church. The dynasty came to end in 1301 with the death of King Andrew III of Hungary, while the last member of the House of √Årp√°d, Andrew's daughter, Blessed Elizabeth of T√∂ss, died in 1336 or 1338. All of the subsequent kings of Hungary (with the exception of King Matthias Corvinus) were cognatic descendants of the √Årp√°d dynasty. The House of Cro√ø and the Drummond family of ScotlandMoravsk√Ω historick√Ω sborn√≠k: roƒçenka Moravsk√©ho n√°rodn√≠ho kongresu, Moravsk√Ω n√°rodn√≠ kongres, 2002, p. 523 claim to descend from G√©za and George, sons of medieval Hungarian kings: G√©za II and Andrew I, respectively. Origin A map with a possible Hungarian Urheimat and route of their migrations towards the Carpathian Basin. According to recent Y-STR and Y-SNP archaeogenetic studies of the skeletal remains of dynasty descendant and King B√©la III of Hungary and unknown √Årp√°d member named as \\"II/52\\" / \\"HU52\\" from the Royal Basilica of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r, it was established that the male lineage belonged to the Y-haplogroup R1a rare subclade R-Z2125 > R-Z2123 > R-Y2632 > R-Y2633 > R-SUR51. The subclade was also found in nearest contemporary matches of 48 Bashkirs from the Burzyansky and Abzelilovsky districts of the Republic of Bashkortostan in the Volga-Ural region, and 1 individual from the region of Vojvodina, Serbia. The √Årp√°d members and one individual from Serbia share additional private SNPs making a novel subclade R-SUR51 > R-ARP, and as the mentioned individual has additional private SNPs it branches from the medieval √Årp√°ds forming R-ARP > R-UVD. Based on the data of the distribution, appearance and coalescence estimation of R-Y2633 the dynasty traces ancient origin near Northern Afghanistan about 4500 years ago, with a separation date of R-ARP from the closest kin Bashkirs from the Volga-Ural region to 2000 years ago, while the individual from Serbia (R-UVD) derives from the √Årp√°ds about 900 years ago. As also the separation of haplogroup N-B539 between the Hungarians and Bashkirs is estimated to have occurred 2000 years ago, it implies that the ancestors of Hungarians left the Volga Ural region about 2000 years ago and started a migration that eventually culminated in settlement in the Carpathian Basin. 9th and 10th centuries Medieval chroniclers stated that the √Årp√°ds' forefather was √úgyek, whose name derived from the ancient Hungarian word for \\"holy\\" (igy).Krist√≥ 1996 Az √Årp√°d p. 9. The Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum (\\"The Deeds of the Huns and Hungarians\\") mentioned that the √Årp√°ds descended from the gens (clan) Turul,Krist√≥ 1994 Korai p. 693. and the Gesta Hungarorum (\\"The Deeds of the Hungarians\\") recorded that the √Årp√°ds' totemic ancestor was a turul (a large bird, probably a falcon).Krist√≥ 1994 Korai p. 693. Medieval chroniclers also referred to a tradition that the √Årp√°ds descended from Attila the Hun ‚Äì the anonymous author of the Gesta Hungarorum, for example, has √Årp√°d say: The first member of the dynasty mentioned by a nearly contemporary written source was √Ålmos. The Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII recorded in his De Administrando Imperio that √Ålmos was the first Grand Prince of the federation of the seven Magyar tribes (megas Turkias arkhon).Krist√≥ 1996 Az √Årp√°d p. 13. √Ålmos probably accepted the supremacy of the Khagan of the Khazars in the beginning of his rule, but, by 862, the Magyar tribal federation broke free from the Khazar Khaganate.Krist√≥ 1996 Az √Årp√°d p. 14. √Ålmos was either the spiritual leader of the tribal federation (kende) or its military commander (gyula).Krist√≥ 1994 Korai p. 40. Around 895, the women and cattle of the Magyar warriors battling in the west were attacked by the Pechenegs, forcing them to leave their territories east of the Carpathian Mountains; the Magyars moved into the Carpathian Basin.T√≥th 1998 Levedi√°t√≥l pp. 189‚Äì211. √Ålmos's death was probably ritual sacrifice, practiced by steppe peoples when the spiritual ruler lost his charisma, and he was followed by his son, √Årp√°d.Krist√≥ 1996 Az √Årp√°d p. 15. The Magyar tribes gradually occupied the whole territory of the Carpathian Basin between 895 and 907.Krist√≥ 1994 Korai p. 266. Between 899 and 970, the Magyars frequently conducted raids into the territories of present-day Italy, Germany, France and Spain and into the lands of the Byzantine Empire.B√≥na 2000 A magyarok pp. 29‚Äì65. Such activities continued westwards until the Battle of Lechfeld (955), when Otto, King of the Germans destroyed their troops; their raids against the Byzantine Empire ended in 970.B√≥na 2000 A magyarok pp. 62‚Äì65. From 917, the Magyars made raids into several territories at the same time, which may have led to the disintegration their tribal federation.Krist√≥ 1995 A magyar √°llam p. 304. The sources prove the existence of at least three and possibly five groups of tribes within the tribal federation, and only one of them was led directly by the √Årp√°ds.Krist√≥ 1995 A magyar √°llam pp. 308‚Äì309. The list of the Grand Princes of the Magyars in the first half of the 10th century is incomplete, which may also prove a lack of central government within their tribal federation.Krist√≥ 1996 Az √Årp√°d p. 22. The medieval chronicles mention that Grand Prince √Årp√°d was followed by his son, Zolt√°n, but contemporary sources only refer to Grand Prince Fajsz (around 950).Krist√≥ 1996 Az √Årp√°d p. 23. After the defeat at the Battle of Lechfeld, Grand Prince Taksony (in or after 955 ‚Äì before 972) adopted the policy of isolation from the Western countries ‚Äì in contrast to his son, Grand Prince G√©za (before 972‚Äì997) who may have sent envoys to Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor in 973.Krist√≥ 1996 Az √Årp√°d pp. 25, 28. G√©za was baptised in 972, and although he never became a convinced Christian, the new faith started to spread among the Hungarians during his reign.Krist√≥ 1996 Az √Årp√°d p. 28. He managed to expand his rule over the territories west of the Danube and the Garam (today Hron in Slovakia), but significant parts of the Carpathian Basin still remained under the rule of local tribal leaders.Krist√≥ 1996 Az √Årp√°d p. 30. G√©za was followed by his son Stephen (originally called Vajk), who had been a convinced follower of Christianity.Krist√≥ 1996 Az √Årp√°d p. 32. Stephen had to face the rebellion of his relative, Kopp√°ny, who claimed G√©za's inheritance based on the Magyar tradition of agnatic seniority.Krist√≥ 1996 Az √Årp√°d p. 35. He was able to defeat Kopp√°ny with the assistance of the German retinue of his wife, Giselle of Bavaria.Krist√≥ 1996 Az √Årp√°d pp. 35‚Äì36.  11th century  The Grand Prince Stephen was crowned on December 25, 1000, or January 1, 1001), becoming the first King of Hungary (1000‚Äì1038) and founder of the state.Krist√≥ 1996 Az √Årp√°d p. 39.Krist√≥ 1994 Korai p. 290. He unified the Carpathian Basin under his rule by 1030, subjugating the territories of the Black Magyars and the domains that had been ruled by (semi-)independent local chieftains (e.g., by the Gyula Prokuj, Ajtony).Krist√≥ 1996 Az √Årp√°d pp. 40‚Äì41, 47.Krist√≥ 1994 Korai pp. 216, 245. He introduced the administrative system of the kingdom, based on counties (comitatus), and founded an ecclesiastic organization with two archbishoprics and several bishoprics.Krist√≥ 1996 Az √Årp√°d pp. 40‚Äì41. Following the death of his son, Emeric (September 2, 1031), King Stephen I assigned his sister's son, the Venetian Peter Orseolo as his heir which resulted in a conspiracy led by his cousin, Vazul, who had been living imprisoned in Nyitra (today Nitra in Slovakia). Vazul was blinded on King Stephen's order and his three sons (Levente, Andrew and B√©la) were exiled.Krist√≥ 1996 Az √Årp√°d pp. 49‚Äì50.Krist√≥ 1994 Korai p. 721. When King Stephen I died on August 15, 1038, Peter Orseolo ascended to the throne, but he had to struggle with King Stephen's brother-in-law, Samuel Aba (1041‚Äì1044).Benda 1981 Magyarorsz√°g pp. 83‚Äì84. King Peter's rule ended in 1046 when an extensive revolt of the pagan Hungarians broke out and he was captured by them.Benda 1981 Magyarorsz√°g p. 85. With the assistance of the pagans, Duke Vazul's son, Andrew, who had been living in exile in the Kievan Rus' and had been baptized there, seized power and was crowned; thus, a member of a collateral branch of the dynasty seized the crown.Krist√≥ 1996 Az √Årp√°d pp. 70‚Äì71.Krist√≥ 1994 Korai p. 42. King Andrew I (1046‚Äì1060) managed to pacify the pagan rebels and restore the position of Christianity in the kingdom.Krist√≥ 1996 Az √Årp√°d p. 72. In 1048, King Andrew invited his younger brother, B√©la to the kingdom and conceded one-third of the counties of the kingdom (Tercia pars regni) in appanage to him.Krist√≥ 1994 Korai. This dynastic division of the kingdom, mentioned as the first one in the Chronicon Pictum (prima regni huius divisio), was followed by several similar divisions during the 11th through 13th centuries, when parts of the kingdom were governed by members of the √Årp√°d dynasty.Krist√≥ 1979 A feud√°lis p. 44. In the 11th century, the counties entrusted to the members of the ruling dynasty did not form a separate province within the kingdom, but they were organized around two or three centers.Krist√≥ 1994 Korai. The dukes governing the Tercia pars regni accepted the supremacy of the kings of Hungary, but some of them (B√©la, G√©za and √Ålmos) rebelled against the king in order to acquire the crown and allied themselves with the rulers of the neighboring countries.Benda 1981 Magyarorsz√°g pp. 85‚Äì100. Ladislaus I of Hungary King Andrew I was the first king who had his son, Solomon crowned during his life in order to ensure his son's succession (1057).Benda 1981 Magyarorsz√°g pp. 87. However, the principle of agnatic primogeniture was not able to overcome the tradition of seniority, and following King Andrew I, his brother, King B√©la I (1060‚Äì1063) acquired the throne despite the claims of the young Solomon.Krist√≥ 1996 Az √Årp√°d pp. 79‚Äì81. From 1063 until 1080 there were frequent conflicts between King Solomon (1057‚Äì1080) and his cousins, G√©za, Ladislaus and Lampert who governed the Tercia pars regni.Benda 1981 Magyarorsz√°g pp. 88‚Äì92. Duke G√©za rebelled against his cousin in 1074 and was proclaimed king by his partisans in accordance with the principle of seniority.Benda 1981 Magyarorsz√°g p. 90. When King G√©za I died (April 25, 1077) his partisans, disregarding his young sons, proclaimed his brother Ladislaus king.Krist√≥ 1996 Az √Årp√°d p. 126.Krist√≥ 1994 Korai. King Ladislaus I (1077‚Äì1095) managed to persuade King Solomon, who had been ruling in some western counties, to abdicate the throne.Krist√≥ 1996 Az √Årp√°d p. 95. During his reign, the Kingdom of Hungary strengthened and Ladislaus I was able to expand his rule over neighboring Kingdom of Croatia (1091).Krist√≥ 1996 Az √Årp√°d pp. 112‚Äì124. He entrusted the government of the newly occupied territories to his younger nephew, √Ålmos.Benda 1981 Magyarorsz√°g p. 94. On 20 August 1083, two members of the dynasty, King Stephen I and his son, Duke Emeric, were canonized in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r upon the initiative of King Ladislaus I.Krist√≥ 1996 Az √Årp√°d p. 119.Benda 1981 Magyarorsz√°g p. 93. His daughter Eirene, the wife of the Byzantine Emperor John II Komnenos, is venerated by the Eastern Orthodox Church.Klaniczay 2000 Az uralkod√≥k pp. 159‚Äì160. When King Ladislaus I died, his elder nephew Coloman was proclaimed king (1095‚Äì1116), but he had to concede the Tercia pars regni in appanage to his brother √Ålmos.Benda 1981 Magyarorsz√°g p. 96. King Coloman defeated Croatian army led by Petar Snaƒçiƒá in Battle of Gvozd Mountain (1097) and was crowned King of Croatia and Dalmatia in 1102 in Biograd. 12th century King Coloman deprived his brother √Ålmos of his duchy (the Tercia pars regni) in 1107.Krist√≥ 1994 Korai p. 261. He caught his second wife, Eufemia of Kiev, in adultery; she was divorced and sent back to Kiev around 1114.Benda 1981 Magyarorsz√°g p. 102. Eufemia bore a son, named Boris in Kiev, but King Coloman refused to accept him as his son.Krist√≥ 1996 Az √Årp√°d p. 146. Around 1115, the king had Duke √Ålmos and his son, King B√©la, blinded in order to ensure the succession of his own son, King Stephen II (1116‚Äì1131).Krist√≥ 1994 Korai. King Stephen II did not father any sons, and his sister's son Saul was proclaimed heir to his throne instead of the blind Duke B√©la.Krist√≥ 1996 Az √Årp√°d p. 158. When King Stephen II died on March 1, 1131, his blind cousin managed nevertheless to acquire the throne.Benda 1981 Magyarorsz√°g p. 105. King B√©la II (1131‚Äì1141) strengthened his rule by defeating King Coloman's alleged son, Boris, who endeavoured to deprive him of the throne with foreign military assistance.Krist√≥ 1996 Az √Årp√°d pp. 166‚Äì169. King B√©la II occupied some territories in Bosnia, and he conceded the new territory in appanage to his younger son, Ladislaus.Benda 1981 Magyarorsz√°g p. 106. Henceforward, members of the √Årp√°d dynasty governed southern or eastern provinces (i.e., Slavonia, and Transylvania) of the kingdom instead of the Tercia pars regni.Krist√≥ 1994 Korai. King Saint Stephen ‚Äì a flag with the \\"double cross\\" (Chronicon Pictum, c. 1370) During the reign of King G√©za II (1141‚Äì1162), the Bishop Otto of Freising recorded that all the Hungarians \\"are so obedient to the monarch that not only irritating him by open opposition but even offending him by concealed whispers would be considered a felony by them\\".Krist√≥ 1996 Az √Årp√°d p. 181. His son, King Stephen III (1162‚Äì1172) had to struggle for his throne against his uncles, Kings Ladislaus II (1162‚Äì1163) and Stephen IV (1163‚Äì1165), who rebelled against him with the assistance of the Byzantine Empire.Krist√≥ 1996 Az √Årp√°d pp. 190‚Äì196. During his reign, the Emperor Manuel I Komnenos occupied the southern provinces of the kingdom on the pretext that the king's brother, B√©la (the Despotes Alexius) lived in his court.Krist√≥ 1996 Az √Årp√°d pp. 206‚Äì208. As the fianc√© of the Emperor's only daughter, Despotes Alexius was the heir presumptive to the Emperor for a short period (1165‚Äì1169).Krist√≥ 1996 Az √Årp√°d pp. 207‚Äì208. The coat of arms of Halych (attributed arms) Following the death of King Stephen III, King B√©la III (1173‚Äì1196) ascended the throne, but he had imprisoned his brother G√©za in order to secure his rule.Benda 1981 Magyarorsz√°g pp. 117‚Äì121. King B√©la III, who had been educated in the Byzantine Empire, was the first king who used the \\"double cross\\" as the symbol of the Kingdom of Hungary.Bert√©nyi 1983 Kis magyar p. 67. In 1188, B√©la occupied Halych, whose prince had been dethroned by his boyars, and granted the principality to his second son Andrew, but his rule became unpopular and the Hungarian troops were expelled from Halych in 1189.Benda 1981 Magyarorsz√°g p. 121. On June 27, 1192, the third member of the dynasty, King Ladislaus I was canonized in V√°rad (today Oradea in Romania).Benda 1981 Magyarorsz√°g p. 122. King B√©la III bequeathed his kingdom intact to his elder son, King Emeric (1196‚Äì1204), but the new king had to concede Croatia and Dalmatia in appanage to his brother Andrew, who had rebelled against him.Benda 1981 Magyarorsz√°g p. 124. 13th century Flag of the √Årp√°d dynasty (9th century ‚Äì 1301) The red and white stripes were the symbol of the √Årp√°ds in the 13th century, first used in the coat of arms in 1202 on one of Emeric's seal. This seal did not include the double cross, only the stripes, and there were nine lions on the white stripes. In the Golden Bull of Andrew II there were only seven lions facing each other, with linden leaves at the center. King Emeric married Constance of Aragon, from the house of Barcelona, and he may have followed Barcelonese (Catalan) patterns when he chose his coat-of-arms that would become the √Årp√°ds' familiar badge (an escutcheon barry of eight Gules and Argent).Bert√©nyi 1983 Kis magyar p. 70. His son and successor, King Ladislaus III (1204‚Äì1205) died in childhood and was followed by his uncle, King Andrew II (1205‚Äì1235).Benda 1981 Magyarorsz√°g p. 127. His reign was characterized by permanent internal conflicts: a group of conspirators murdered his queen, Gertrude of Merania (1213); discontent noblemen obliged him to issue the Golden Bull of 1222 establishing their rights (including the right to disobey the king); and he quarreled with his eldest son, B√©la who endeavoured to take back the royal domains his father had granted to his followers.Krist√≥ 1996 Az √Årp√°d pp. 229‚Äì245. King Andrew II, who had been Prince of Halych (1188‚Äì1189), intervened regularly in the internal struggles of the principality and made several efforts to ensure the rule of his younger sons (Coloman or Andrew) in the neighboring country.Benda 1981 Magyarorsz√°g pp. 127‚Äì144. One of his daughters, Elizabeth was canonized during his lifetime (July 1, 1235) and thus became the fourth saint of the √Årp√°ds.Benda 1981 Magyarorsz√°g p. 144. King Andrew's elder sons disowned his posthumous son, Stephen, who would be educated in Ferrara.Krist√≥ 1994 Korai p. 294. Members of the family reigned occasionally in the Principality (later Kingdom) of Halych (1188‚Äì1189, 1208‚Äì1209, 1214‚Äì1219, 1227‚Äì1229, 1231‚Äì1234) and in the Duchy of Styria (1254‚Äì1260). The coat-of-arms of Styria King B√©la IV (1235‚Äì1270) restored the royal power, but his kingdom became devastated during the Mongol invasion (1241‚Äì1242).Krist√≥ 1996 Az √Årp√°d pp. 254‚Äì260. Following the withdrawal of the Mongol troops, several fortresses were built or enstrengthened on his order.Krist√≥ 1994 Korai p. 711. He also granted town privileges to several settlements in his kingdom, e.g., Buda, Nagyszombat (today Trnava in Slovakia), Selmecb√°nya (now Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica in Slovakia) and Pest received their privileges from him.Krist√≥ 1994 Korai pp. 130, 479, 543, 598, 716‚Äì717. King B√©la IV managed to occupy the Duchy of Styria for a short period (1254‚Äì1260), but later he had to abandon it in favour of King Ottokar II of Bohemia.Benda 1981 Magyarorsz√°g pp. 154, 157. During his last years, he was struggling with his son, Stephen who was crowned during his lifetime and obliged his father to concede the eastern parts of the kingdom to him.Krist√≥ 1994 Korai p. 294. Two of his daughters, Margaret and Kinga were canonized (in 1943 and 1999 respectively) and a third daughter of his, Yolanda was beatified (in 1827).Klaniczay 2000 Az uralkod√≥k pp. 178‚Äì179.CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Blessed Margaret of Hungary His fourth daughter, Constance was also venerated in Lviv.Klaniczay 2000 Az uralkod√≥k pp. 178‚Äì192. When King Stephen V (1270‚Äì1272) ascended the throne, many of his father's followers left for Bohemia.Krist√≥ 1996 Az √Årp√°d p. 272. They returned during the reign of his son, King Ladislaus IV the Cuman (1272‚Äì1290) whose reign was characterized by internal conflicts among the members of different aristocratic groups.Krist√≥ 1996 Az √Årp√°d p. 277. King Ladislaus IV, whose mother was of Cuman origin, preferred the companion of the nomadic and semi-pagan Cumans; therefore, he was excommunicated several times, but he was murdered by Cuman assassins.Krist√≥ 1996 Az √Årp√°d pp. 278‚Äì282. The disintegration of the kingdom started during his reign when several aristocrats endeavoured to acquire possessions on the account of the royal domains.Krist√≥ 1994 Korai p. 663. When King Ladislaus IV died, most of his contemporaries thought that the dynasty of the √Årp√°ds had come to an end, because the only patrilineal descendant of the family, Andrew, was the son of Duke Stephen, the posthumous son of King Andrew II who had been disowned by his brothers.Krist√≥ 1996 Az √Årp√°d pp. 282‚Äì283. Nevertheless, Duke Andrew \\"the Venetian\\" was crowned with the Holy Crown of Hungary and most of the barons accepted his rule.Krist√≥ 1996 Az √Årp√°d pp. 283‚Äì284. During his reign, King Andrew III (1290‚Äì1301) had to struggle with the powerful barons (e.g., with members of the Cs√°k and K≈ëszegi families).Krist√≥ 1996 Az √Årp√°d pp. 285‚Äì288.

Pre-history  Much of the pre-history of Peru was driven by the location of farmable land. The most populated coastal regions of Peru are the two parallel mountain ranges and the series of 20 to 30 rivers descending through its coastal desert. In dry periods only the mountains had enough rainfall for agriculture while the desert coast was empty. In wet periods many cultures thrived along the rivers. The Inca were a mountain-based culture that expanded when the climate became wetter, often sending conquered peoples down from the mountains into fallow but farmable lowlands. In contrast, the Moche were a lowland culture that died out after a strong El Ni√±o, which caused abnormally high rainfall and floods followed by a long drought. A study reported that crops of squash, peanuts, and cotton were domesticated in Peru around 10,000, 8,500, and 6,000 years ago, respectively. They were grown by the √ëanchoc people in the √ëanchoc Valley. No earlier instances of the farming of these crops are known. = Humboldt current = Peru is both afflicted and blessed by a peculiar climate due to the Humboldt Current. Before over fishing killed its fishery, Peru had the world's most productive fishery due to the cold Current. It lifts nutrients from the Pacific floor to surface waters. On land, it results in a cold mist that covers coastal Peru to the extent that desert plants have adapted to obtain water from the air instead of from (infrequent) rainfall. The wet side soil is thin, while few rivers operate on the dry side. This means all the water must be brought from the Atlantic side of the Andean mountain ranges that split Peru. Many obstacles limited Peru's agricultural production. Peru has always been rich in natural resources such as tin, silver, gold, guano and rubber. These resources were found, not grown. Train tracks did not connect its peoples; instead they connected the sources of these valuable resources to the sea. So few ways helped to bring agricultural products to market. The road system is underdeveloped in Peru, e.g., offering no connection to neighboring Brazil. Only a little over a quarter of the 15th-century Inca road system has been modernized. Another obstacle is the large size of Peru's informal economy. This prevents Peru from relying on an income tax to run the government. Much of its revenue instead comes from a 13% tax on gross agricultural sales. This squeezes Peruvian farmers who must compete with farmers in countries that tax farmers on net profit. No profit, no tax. Twenty-first century Peru grows agricultural commodities such as asparagus, potatoes, maize, rice, quinoa and coffee. Peru provides half of the world supply of quinoa. Peruvian agriculture uses synthetic fertilizers rather than still-abundant guano due to infrastructure issues. Peruvian maize is not exportable due to large producer subsidies in Europe and the United States. Coffee is exportable, because little is grown in those countries. In recent years Peru has become the world's primary source of high-quality organic coffee.\\"Peru: Organic Products Update 2008\\" . USDA Foreign Agricultural Service Global Agriculture Information Network. Retrieved 7 January 2010. Peru does not have a quality control program such as Kenya's, but its government has worked to educate farmers on how to improve quality. Despite the glut of coffee in the market today, coffee production in Peru's unusual high altitudes and partial shade is allows Coffea arabica to flourish, and it has much more of such land available than competitors such as Jamaica and Hawaii. Aqueducts and terraces Aqueduct at Cumbe MayoAn entrance to Nazca's Puquios The ancient people of Peru built water-moving and preserving technologies like the aqueducts of Cumbe Mayo (c. 1500 BCE) and the Nazca's underground aqueducts called Puquios (date uncertain), or the terraced gardens of the Huari. Aqueducts were also utilized by the Moche. Another technique used for farming was terracing. The Chavin, Moche, and Incas built terraces, or andenes, into the sides of hills. The andenes reduced erosion that would normally damage a steep hill. These terraces are still used.Sayer, page 25. Incans irrigated their fields with a system of reservoirs and cisterns to collect water, which was then distributed by canals and ditches. However, by the mid-19th century, only 3% of Peru's land was still farmable. It lagged behind many other South American countries in agriculture. Guano In the 19th century the Inca fertilizer guano (saltpetre) became the most important resource in Peru's modern history, for its use as a fertilizer and as gunpowder.Leonard, Andrew.\\"When guano imperialists ruled the earth\\". Salon.com. Retrieved 7 January 2010. The stock of guano built up because the Humboldt current once drew thousands of anchovies and other fish, which in turn, attracted thousands of birds. The population of white-breasted cormorants, gray pelicans and piqueros flourished due to a lack of predators. The guano (droppings) left by the birds retained its nitrate content because of the arid climate. The Inventory of Conflict & Environment (ICE). Between 1840 and 1880, Peru sold around 20 million tons of guano, mostly to Great Britain. Peru earned about 2 billion dollars in profit. Peru lost its guano reserves to Chile (backed by the British Empire) in the War of the Pacific.\\"War of the Pacific 1879-1884\\" . Wars of the World*. Retrieved 7 January 2009. By the late 19th century, 50% of the Peruvian government's revenue was going to pay off loans that been guaranteed with guano sources taken by Chile - these debts were eventually paid by sending all the remaining guano to France when it was preparing for war. The Germans invented the Haber process shortly after the outbreak of World War I, after which guano became almost worthless. As Peru's guano reserves began to run out, the government restricted the guano industry to help stabilize the supplies. The collapse of Peru's bird population after the collapse of the fishery limited future supply of the fertilizer. Current production Peru is one of the 5 largest producers of avocado, blueberry, artichoke and asparagus, one of the 10 largest producers in the world of coffee, one of the 15 largest producers in the world of potato and pineapple, and also has a considerable production of grape, sugarcane, rice, banana, maize and cassava; its agriculture is considerably diversified.Peru en 2018, by FAO In 2018, Peru produced 10.3 million tons of sugarcane, 5.1 million tons of potato, 3.5 million tons of rice, 2.2 million tons of banana, 1.5 million tons of maize, 1.2 million tons of cassava, 921 thousand tons of palm oil, 645 thousand tons of grape, 548 thousand tons of pineapple, 504 thousand tons of avocado, 481 thousand tons of tangerine, 502 thousand tons of orange, 369 thousand tons of coffee, 383 thousand tons of mango, 360 thousand tons of asparagus, 270 thousand tons of lemon, 252 thousand tons of tomato , 207 thousand tons of barley, 195 thousand tons of wheat, 188 thousand tons of olives, 187 thousand tons of carrots, 175 thousand tons of papaya, 175 thousand tons of pepper, 154 thousand tons of artichoke, 140 thousand tons of apple, 134 thousand tons of cocoa, in addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products.Peru production in 2018, by FAO Peruvian agricultural products File:Potato_plants.jpgPotato plants File:Corncobs.jpgMaize ears File:Arrozal-caazapa-paraguay.jpegRice field File:Hinohikari.jpgRice plants File:Coffee_Flowers_Show.jpgFlowering coffee tree References =Sources= * * Peru Category:Agriculture in Peru Category:Economic history of Peru ","title":"Agricultural history of Peru"},{"id":"549509","text":"Bonosus (died AD 280) was a late 3rd-century Roman usurper.

Types Bridge-shaped stile in Hanbury, Worcestershire In the United Kingdom many stiles were built under legal compulsion (see Rights of way in the United Kingdom).

The Mitki movement The Mitki movement originally emerged from Vladimir Shinkarev‚Äôs literary work Mitki, which consists of eight chapters. The first five chapters were written between 1984 and 1985, though the book was not finished until four years later. The complete version was officially published in 1990. It encompasses a collection of ironic and absurd essays, anecdotes, conversations and opinions on different cultural subjects, which extend artistic sensibility and development into a comprehensive and cohesive life philosophy that even includes a specifically developed language. Although Mitki is fictional it draws on the characteristics of real people, combining these to create Mityok, the archetypal member of the Mitki group who acts on the instructions provided by the Mitki script. The Mitki group consisted of a number of St. Petersburg friends and artists of which were the main members Vladimir Shinkarev, Alexander Florensky and Dmitri Shagin. Shinkarev's eponymous book supplied the group with the manifesto for their emergent movement. The first collective exhibition of Mitki paintings in 1984 ended peacefully, but the second in St. Petersburg was raided by police.Article about the Mitki by Mikhail Guerman (professor, doctor of Art History; Member of International Association of Art Criticism; Curator of Modern Arts at the St.Petersburg Russian Museum).

Mitki, written before and after Mikhail Gorbachev‚Äôs Perestroika in 1987, expresses the transitions and associated anxieties of its time. Shinkarev and Florensky both left the Mitki group to develop their own work in the new Russia. The Mitki do not promote specific artistic principles, being instead united by a certain collective spirit: an optimistic and straightforward world-view, representation of the wide breadth of the Russian soul, respect for art, humour and freedom.\\"Mitki in Finland\\" exhibition description .

This article takes a generalized abstract mathematical approach to signal sampling and reconstruction. For a more practical approach based on band-limited signals, see Whittaker‚ÄìShannon interpolation formula.  General principle  Let F be any sampling method, i.e. a linear map from the Hilbert space of square-integrable functions L^2 to complex space \\\\mathbb C^n. In our example, the vector space of sampled signals \\\\mathbb C^n is n-dimensional complex space. Any proposed inverse R of F (reconstruction formula, in the lingo) would have to map \\\\mathbb C^n to some subset of L^2. We could choose this subset arbitrarily, but if we're going to want a reconstruction formula R that is also a linear map, then we have to choose an n-dimensional linear subspace of L^2. This fact that the dimensions have to agree is related to the Nyquist‚ÄìShannon sampling theorem. The elementary linear algebra approach works here. Let d_k:=(0,...,0,1,0,...,0) (all entries zero, except for the kth entry, which is a one) or some other basis of \\\\mathbb C^n. To define an inverse for F, simply choose, for each k, an e_k \\\\in L^2 so that F(e_k)=d_k. This uniquely defines the (pseudo-)inverse of F. Of course, one can choose some reconstruction formula first, then either compute some sampling algorithm from the reconstruction formula, or analyze the behavior of a given sampling algorithm with respect to the given formula. Ideally, the reconstruction formula is derived by minimizing the expected error variance. This requires that either the signal statistics is known or a prior probability for the signal can be specified. Information field theory is then an appropriate mathematical formalism to derive an optimal reconstruction formula.  Popular reconstruction formulae  Perhaps the most widely used reconstruction formula is as follows. Let \\\\\\\\{ e_k \\\\\\\\} be a basis of L^2 in the Hilbert space sense; for instance, one could use the eikonal :e_k(t):=e^{2\\\\pi i k t}\\\\,, although other choices are certainly possible. Note that here the index k can be any integer, even negative. Then we can define a linear map R by :R(d_k)=e_k\\\\, for each k=\\\\lfloor -n/2 \\\\rfloor,...,\\\\lfloor (n-1)/2 \\\\rfloor, where (d_k) is the basis of \\\\mathbb C^n given by :d_k(j)=e^{2 \\\\pi i j k \\\\over n} (This is the usual discrete Fourier basis.) The choice of range k=\\\\lfloor -n/2 \\\\rfloor,...,\\\\lfloor (n-1)/2 \\\\rfloor is somewhat arbitrary, although it satisfies the dimensionality requirement and reflects the usual notion that the most important information is contained in the low frequencies. In some cases, this is incorrect, so a different reconstruction formula needs to be chosen. A similar approach can be obtained by using wavelets instead of Hilbert bases. For many applications, the best approach is still not clear today.

Plot summary =From the Mountains of Mist to Tear= Rand al'Thor, having been declared the Dragon Reborn by Moiraine Damodred, secretly goes to Tear to prove himself. Along the way he is hunted by Darkhounds and Darkfriends. After leaving in secret, Moiraine, Lan, and Perrin follow always one step behind. Rand leaves in his trail a pattern of weddings and strange events. Perrin comes across an Aiel warrior that was captured and in a cage. He frees him, earning a friendship with Gaul, a Stone Dog, who will accompany Perrin on his travels. This event is witnessed by a hunter of the horn, Zarine \\"Faile\\" Bashere, who joins the party as well. Min reports to the Amyrlin Seat, while Moiraine, Lan Mandragoran, Loial, and Perrin Aybara follow Rand. En route they acquire Zarine Bashere (alias Faile), battle Darkhounds, and discover that the Forsaken Sammael rules in Illian. =From Tar Valon to Tear= Mat Cauthon is taken to Tar Valon by Verin Mathwin, Nynaeve al'Meara, Egwene al'Vere, Elayne Trakand, and Hurin. Immediately after arrival in Tar Valon, Hurin departs to report to King Easar in Shienar. The Amyrlin Seat, Siuan Sanche, sets Nynaeve, Egwene, and later Elayne, to hunting down the Black Ajah, and therefore to Tear. In the White Tower, through the use of a sa'angreal by Aes Sedai, Mat is healed of the corruptive influence of the ruby dagger of Shadar Logoth. Once healed Mat defeats Galad Damodred and Gawyn Trakand in a practice sword battle, using a quarterstaff. This wins him enough money to gamble with and escape from Tar Valon; at which Elayne entrusts Mat with a letter to her mother Queen Morgase. Mat finds Thom Merrilin, and they together travel to Andor, where Mat delivers the letter and learns of a plot by Queen Morgase's lover, Lord Gaebril, to murder Elayne. To prevent that murder, Mat pursues the killers to Tear. =Climax in the Stone of Tear= In Tear, Nynaeve, Egwene, and Elayne are betrayed by Juilin Sandar (under the influence of Liandrin) to the Black Ajah and imprisoned in the Stone of Tear, whence they are rescued by Mat and a repentant Juilin. Faile falls into a trap meant for Moiraine, and Perrin risks his life to rescue her. Rand and the Forsaken Be'lal duel in the Stone of Tear, until Moiraine kills Be'lal with balefire. Ba'alzamon disables Moiraine and attacks Rand, whereupon Rand takes Callandor (a more powerful sa'angreal), and apparently kills Ba'alzamon; but Moiraine argues that the Dark One, having no tangible body, is not represented by the dead man. Egwene, remembering a prophecy, instead deduces that the corpse is possibly Ishamael, Chief among the Forsaken. The Aiel in Tear conquer the Stone in loyalty to Rand. Notes Among The Wheel of Time books, The Dragon Reborn was unique at the time in that it only had a handful of chapters told from Rand al'Thor's point of view. Instead, nearly all chapters are told from the perspectives of his friends and allies as they race to catch up to him and help him. This is unusual: Rand is the protagonist of the series and, as the Dragon Reborn, he is the title character of this book. However, although few chapters are told from his point of view, his presence in the plot is ubiquitous; all major characters in the book are either trying to help him or are working against him.

Bitter invented the Bitter plate used in resistive magnets (also called Bitter electromagnets). He also developed the water cooling method inherent to the design of Bitter magnets. Prior to this development, there was no way to cool electromagnets, limiting their maximum flux density. Early life Francis Bitter was born in the Weehawken, New Jersey. His father, Karl Bitter, was a prominent sculptor. Bitter entered the University of Chicago in 1919, but chose to leave his studies there in 1922 in order to visit Europe. He later transferred to Columbia University and graduated in 1925. He continued his studies in Berlin from 1925 to 1926 and received a Ph.D. at Columbia in 1928. At Columbia, Bitter began his lifelong fascination with magnets. Career Under a National Research Council fellowship, Bitter studied gases at Caltech with Robert Andrews Millikan, from 1928 to 1930. While at Caltech, he married Alice Coomara. She had been a moderately successful singer working under the stage name Ratan Devi. In 1930, Bitter went to work for Westinghouse, where he worked on various theoretical and applied problems concerning ferromagnetism. With a Guggenheim Fellowship, Bitter travelled to England in 1933 and worked at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University. There, he worked with Peter Kapitza on pulsed magnetic fields. The following year, Bitter returned to America and his work at Westinghouse. Later in 1934, he joined the faculty at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and continued to consult for Westinghouse. =At M.I.T.= Bitter joined the Department of Mining and Metallurgy as an associate professor in 1934. (The department is now known as Materials Science and Engineering.) While at MIT, he developed the Bitter electromagnet which was/is the most powerful electromagnet design. He established a magnet laboratory in 1938, where he built a solenoid magnet that produced a constant field of 100,000 gauss (10 teslas). He also did work in the first characterization of the Zeeman effect with George Harrison. During the Second World War, Bitter worked for the Naval Bureau of Ordnance. He often traveled to England to find ways to demagnetize British ships to protect them from a new type of German mine, which used a compass needle to trigger detonation. The mine, dropped from the air, would sink to the bottom of a river and remain there with its magnetic needle aligned to the Earth's magnetic field at that location. When a ship passed over it, the mass of the ship caused the magnetic needle to move slightly. The movement was enough to detonate the mine. In his autobiography Magnets, the Education of a Physicist, he referred to this unique work as \\"Degaussing the fleet\\". (It is possible that he worked with Francis Crick, who was researching the same problem.) After the war, Bitter returned to MIT and joined the faculty of the physics department. He became a full professor in 1951, and from 1956 to 1960, he served as associate dean of MIT's school of science. From 1962 to 1965, Bitter was the housemaster of Ashdown House, MIT's graduate dormitory.

For a list of naval forces from the United Kingdom, see British naval forces in the Falklands War. Background The Argentine Navy (ARA), particularly its commander-in-chief and Junta member, Admiral Jorge Anaya, was the main architect and supporter of a military solution to resolve the long-standing claim of sovereignty over the islands. By 1982 the country was already in the midst of a devastating economic crisis and large-scale civil unrest against the repressive government and Anaya, now a member of the ruling Junta, ordered Operation Rosario to be brought forward to 2 April, after a group of Argentina military infiltrated a group of Argentine scrap metal merchants and raised the Argentine flag at South Georgia 19 March. General Galtieri, acting president, agreed in his intention to mount a quick, symbolic occupation, followed rapidly by a withdrawal, leaving only a small garrison to support the new military governor and force the UK to begin talks on the long-delayed sovereignty claim. On 2 April an amphibious landing was made at Stanley and on 3 April Argentine marines used helicopters to take over the Georgias. Whilst the military junta was redeploying the assault units back to their home bases they found the British responded with a large-scale mobilisation to organise a naval task force and ground forces to retake the islands by force. The war could not have happened at a worse time for the Argentines. They were expecting new destroyers, frigates and submarines being built in West Germany and their shipment of French Super √âtendards and Exocets were not yet complete.

Her writings frequently call for people \\"to repent, love God, and unify the churches.\\" She has developed a large following, particularly among Roman Catholics, who come to her lectures and buy her writings and tapes. She writes the messages in English, and has changed some writings between editions. In 1995, the Catholic Church's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF), led by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, published a Notification (a message from the Holy See) on the writings of Ryd√©n, saying her communications should not be considered supernatural, and calling all Catholic bishops to prevent Ryd√©n's ideas from being spread in their dioceses. In 2007, Cardinal William Levada confirmed that the 1995 Notification was still in effect; he recommended that Catholics should not join prayer groups organized by Ryd√©n. In 2011, the Greek Orthodox Church officially disapproved of Ryd√©n's teachings, instructing their faithful to disassociate from Ryd√©n. In 2012, the Church of Cyprus said that Ryd√©n's teachings were heretical.  Early life  Ryd√©n was born Vassiliki Claudia Pendakis on January 18, 1942, in Heliopolis on the outskirts of Cairo, Egypt, the daughter of Greek Orthodox parents established in Egypt. Ryden says that from the age of six, she experienced waking dreams and nightmares that she attributed to Satan who was trying to kill her. When she was 10‚Äì12 years old, she had waking dreams of a spiritual marriage with Jesus Christ, as Blessed Virgin Mary was looking on. Ryd√©n started school in Egypt, and then at the age of 15, she emigrated with her family to Europe. She painted and competed in tennis. During her late teens, she said she was surrounded upon occasion by the spirits of dead people, who she said were asking her to help them. None of her childhood or teenage mystical experiences resulted in a personal religious transformation, and Ryd√©n went on to live a fairly secular life indifferent to religion. In November 1966, she married a Lutheran man in the city of Lausanne, Switzerland, at a Greek Orthodox Church. Her husband was a student who obtained a position with the United Nations after graduation. The couple had two sons together. Because of the husband's job, the family lived in various places in Asia and Africa. From 1966 to 1980, Ryd√©n kept up an active social life. She did not practice any particular religion. The couple was divorced in Sweden in November, 1980. On June 13, 1981, she married her current husband, Per Ryd√©n, a Swedish Lutheran who had been working for the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) in Mozambique. He took a new position with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) department of the United Nations in Lesotho from 1981 to 1983, then worked again for SIDA from 1984 to 1987 in Bangladesh. Ryd√©n modeled as a hobby, and painted in oils. She also competed in tennis, once winning the women's doubles in a national tournament in Bangladesh. On October 31, 1990, the Ryd√©ns celebrated their existing union in the Greek Orthodox Church in Lausanne.  Writings  A copy of Ryd√©n's handwritten notes transcribing what she says are messages from Jesus and angels. In November 1985 when Ryd√©n was living in Bangladesh, Ryd√©n says she experienced an extraordinary sensation when writing a grocery list, a list of cocktail party expenses, Originally published on www.infovassula.ch in the Italian language. or a list of errands. Ryd√©n says she suddenly experienced a light electrical feeling in her right hand and at the same time, an invisible presence. She was unable to open her hand, nor lift her arm. She said \\"an invisible force pushed my hand. I was not afraid, I do not know why.\\" She says she permitted her hand to be guided and that she wrote a line in a very different style from her own with the words: \\"I am your guardian Angel and my name is Daniel.\\" Ryd√©n says that this guardian Angel prepared her for three months to become a conduit of spiritual messages.Jovanovic 1997, p. 291. After a few weeks of such training, Ryd√©n says she had a vision and message from Jesus Christ. Ryd√©n has also received messages from what she says is the Devil. An evil presence has moved her hand to write, sometimes making her write sensible words. She says that Jesus taught her to discern which spirits were engaging her in the writing of messages, and that the Devil's hand thus became recognizable to her. After six months of receiving messages, Ryd√©n says she was directed by her guardian angel to find a local American priest named James \\"Jim\\" Fannan and tell him about her experiences. First, though, she encountered a German priest named Karl who said she was mentally imbalanced and should consult a doctor. After several more visits from Ryd√©n, Karl summoned Fannan and the two priests watched Ryd√©n at times when she says she received messages. Fannan's initial response was that the messages were not from God but were some evil spirit. Fannan instructed Ryd√©n to refuse the messages.Ryd√©n 2013, pp. 64‚Äì68. Distraught, Ryd√©n went home and asked her guardian angel for guidance about Fannan; she says that God told her \\"I will bend him.\\" In early 1987, Fannan told Ryd√©n to speak with the priest Raymond Dujarrier. Preparing to travel to Dujarrier, Ryd√©n says she received an evil message: \\"A liar was guiding you, collect everything and burn it.\\" Seconds later, Ryd√©n says she felt the presence of God who guided her hand to write: \\"I will be with you till the end, we are united forever; let My Light shine on you child; I am Yahweh guiding you; glorify Me by loving Me...\\" Dujarrier assessed the messages as \\"Divine Revelations of the Heart\\", and he told Ryd√©n they were given to her to benefit others. After Dujarrier's positive evaluation, Fannan changed his mind and became Ryd√©n's first ardent supporter in the Catholic church. He served as her spiritual adviser, occasionally traveling with her to introduce her to new groups. In August 1987, Ryd√©n's husband began working for the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and the Ryd√©n family moved to Switzerland.Ryd√©n 2013, pp. 79, 100. Ryd√©n showed her messages to various Roman Catholic and Orthodox priests in Switzerland but met with little support. At Fannan's urging, in June 1988 Ryd√©n visited the city of Medjugorje in Bosnia and Herzegovina, to learn more about Our Lady of Medjugorje‚Äîthe apparition of the Virgin Mary which appeared to six children there.Ryd√©n 1990, p. xx. Foreword by James Fannan. In November 1988, Ryd√©n was directed by her guardian angel to publish a book of the collected messages, and to conduct prayer meetings once a month. Theologian and sociologist Patrick de Laubier became interested in Ryd√©n's messages, and introduced her to French Mariologist Father Ren√© Laurentin in August 1989. Laurentin and Fannan were both in the Marian Movement of Priests, a group of priests who studied modern apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Ryd√©n is best known for a collection of nearly 2,000 of these messages published worldwide in many languages as True Life in God. She adheres to the idea that she has been called to transmit to the world the messages she receives. However, Ryd√©n has never published the first ten months' worth of received messages. In 1993, Laurentin said that Ryd√©n planned to publish the first messages. In 1995, Dominican theologian Father Fran√ßois-Marie Dermine, a Canadian-born priest serving as exorcist for the diocese of Bologna, Italy, wrote that Ryd√©n said that she burned the early messages because there were too many, and they were loose scraps, not bound in a notebook. Dermine says that this destruction of the first messages is suspicious, as there would normally be heightened reverence held for them, if they were messages from angels and Jesus. Ryd√©n wrote in 1995 that she destroyed or discarded the first messages. Ryd√©n says that prior to writing the messages, she had never studied catechism or theological formation. Ryd√©n believes that God chose her, a \\"spiritual zero\\" before the revelations began, so as to leave no doubt that it is His power at work. She stated that: \\"Jesus wanted a nothing... in order to prove that I have not invented all this and that it comes from Him. He said it in a message: 'All you have comes from Me and is My Work and not yours. Without Me, you are unable to even wink your eyes-so abandon yourself to Me.'\\" Ryd√©n's first \\"handwritten\\" edition of True Life in God was produced in 1990 by Catholic publisher Editions O.E.I.L. of Paris, with a foreword written by Fannan. In 1991, the organization called Trinitas was formed to typeset Ryd√©n's writings and publish them in many languages. In September 1991, Mariologist Father Philip Pavich was given a copy of Ryd√©n's original messages complete with deletions and modifications showing how Ryd√©n and an editorial assistant had modified the messages for publication. Pavich circulated a critical comparison showing the changes made from the original notebooks to the handwritten edition of True Life in God. Associates of Ryd√©n questioned her; she responded by saying that the deleted text was \\"taken out with God's guidance.\\" She explained that she keeps two notebooks: a private one filled with original messages, and a public one containing material rewritten from the private notebook. Dermine wrote in 2008 that the deleted material includes failed prophecies, and disappointments in Ryd√©n's life, such as the Virgin Mary telling Ryd√©n in June 1988 that she would arrange a meeting between Ryd√©n and Marian Movement of Priests founder Stefano Gobbi‚Äîa meeting that never happened. Ryd√©n asked American Jesuit Father Mitchell Pacwa to review her messages, so he studied the first five volumes of handwritten messages. Pacwa sent his critique to Father Michael O'Carroll, one of Ryd√©n's spiritual advisors, who said that Pacwa ought to refrain from publishing his findings, and implied divine retribution otherwise. Condensed from a larger article appearing in Catholic Twin Circle spanning three issues in August 1993. Pacwa had determined that Ryd√©n's own confused interpretation of the Trinity was echoed in the messages she received, showing that it was Ryd√©n making the messages. Pacwa published his criticism in August 1993, arguing that Ryd√©n and her messages both confused the roles of God the Father, God the Son (Jesus), and the Holy Spirit. Ryd√©n had written in her own hand the explanatory note, \\"Jesus in this whole passage mentions the Father Himself as the Son and the Holy Spirit showing the action and the presence of the Holy Trinity,\\" which Pacwa said demonstrated a \\"muddled, if not heretical\\" understanding of the Trinity. Pacwa listed many similar instances in the received messages of the Son and the Father being intermixed and confused in a manner not in keeping with Roman Catholic or Orthodox Catholic teaching. Years later, Dermine described the reaction of O'Donnell as typical of the Ryd√©n organization's response to criticism‚Äîa demonization of any who oppose Ryd√©n. Ryd√©n's messages are believed by her followers to have been prophetic. The Holy See instructs Catholics that the messages should be considered Ryd√©n's personal meditations, and not divine revelations. = Handwriting = Ryd√©n supporters claim that graphological analysis of the handwriting that Ryd√©n says she produces as dictation shows elements of resisting or being forced and that this is evidence of external spiritual control. In Skeptical Inquirer magazine in 2011, longtime investigator Joe Nickell compared Ryd√©n's \\"messages\\" to alleged communications from Jesus to other women claiming revelations and wrote, \\"the contrived handwriting, the linguistic lapses, and the indications of fantasizing all suggest that Vassula Ryden is not in touch with supernatural entities but is simply engaging in self-deception that in turn deceives the credulous. Her automatic writings therefore are not works of revelation but simply of pious imagination.\\" Nickell says that Ryd√©n's personal misspellings and linguistic errors are identical to those claimed to be written as Jesus, God, Mary, her own invisible \\"guardian angel, Daniel,\\" and Satan, and all seem to have the same hand writing and grammar. Nickell suggests, \\"If God deigns to use the English language, should we not expect it to be rendered accurately?\\" According to Nickell, \\"One suspects that if Ryden were prevented from seeing what was being written, the entities supposedly guiding her hand would be unable to so faithfully follow the lines! I invite Ryden to accept my invitation to perform a scientific test to refute or confirm this suspicion.\\"  Other publications  Ryd√©n continues to produce new volumes of messages in the series True Life in God; in 2003 she published the 12th volume, containing messages from notebooks 102 to 107. In 1995, she published My Angel Daniel, an account of the early messages. In March 2013, Ryd√©n published Heaven Is Real, But So Is Hell.Scarborough MirrorGrech, Prosper (25 January 2014). \\"Messages for All Humanity, Reviewed by a Cardinal who Studied Them‚Ä¶\\", Inside the Vatican.  Reception  Following Father James Fannan, Fathers Rene Laurentin, Robert Faricy, and Michael O'Carroll as well as Archbishop Frane Franic, who are major promoters of Our Lady of Meƒëugorje, also actively support Ryd√©n through their public statements and publications. Upon examination of the many objections made against Ryd√©n, Laurentin stated that: \\"she has excited more opposition than any other.\\"Laurentin 1993, p. 33 In 1996, Belgian theologian Joseph Moerman criticized an attack made by Laurentin on those who had been speaking out against Ryd√©n. Moerman said that Laurentin's defense of Ryd√©n included unwarranted caricaturization of CDF leaders, and unsupported positive analysis of her writings. Moerman said that Ryd√©n's writings could not be directly from Jesus because of inconsistencies within them, and because of differences between the style of known mystics writing in a state of religious ecstasy and Ryd√©n's writings performed in \\"normal lucidity\\". Supporters Fr. Edward O'Connor and Niels Hvidt believe that God is using Ryd√©n's messages to \\"consolidate his church\\" and bring it into unity, which they feel is the main theme of her books. Other believers such as Fr. Ferdinand Umana Montoya say that Ryd√©n's writings are of supernatural origin of a type that he calls \\"hieratic\\" or \\"sacred\\" writing. In 1995, Dermine wrote a book, Vassula Ryd√©n: indagine critica (Vassula Ryd√©n: critical inquiry), analyzing Ryd√©n's first six books. Dermine described Ryd√©n's early works as promoting a New Age-type spirituality including millennialism and pan-Christian ecumenicism, preceded by a time in which the antichrist dominated the Church. He said these ideas were heretical to Roman Catholicism, and that Ryd√©n stopped putting them in her writings after warnings from the Church, a factor which demonstrates that they are her own thoughts, not those of spirits. He showed how Ryd√©n's automatic writings were said by her to be from a variety of sources: guardian angels, Jesus, the Virgin Mary, God, and several Christian saints. Dermine noted that Ryd√©n found some of her own messages to be false; she cancelled these ones. He wrote that Ryd√©n explained away the problem by saying that God told her she could change any messages that she felt did not work. Dermine said that the whole body of Ryd√©n's writings could be dismissed on the basis of this supposed revelation. More damning than that was Dermine's assessment that Ryd√©n's automatic writing was directed not by Jesus or God but by the Devil. Dermine wrote that automatic writing has never been part of Christian mysticism and divine revelation, but it has been connected with demonic possession. In 1999, the Argentine organization Servicio Para el Esclarecimiento en Sectas (Foundation S.P.E.S.), formed to investigate new religious movements and sects, published a two-part bulletin critical of Ryd√©n and her followers, authored by M√≥nica de L√≥pez Roda. De L√≥pez Roda described how Ryd√©n's mission appeared to be the unification of all Christian churches under a non-hierarchical ecumenicism; a spiritual Christianity devoid of doctrinal differences. She said that the positive words from Ryd√©n provoked division among Christians because of questions about whether the messages were fake. De L√≥pez Roda named supporters such as Archbishop Emmanuel Milingo and Father Ren√© Laurentin who reportedly questioned the directives of the 1995 Notification by the Holy See. Meeting in 2004 of Vassula Ryden with then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, head of the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which decided against her in 1995 Some skeptics have noted how the revelations have changed with time and have alleged that this was in order to conform more with church doctrine. Dermine compares Ryd√©n's early publications with later versions, noting that the changes made to the messages are one of the main reasons that the messages should be discredited. In September 2005, the spokesman for the Catholic Church in Scotland warned people against going to Ryd√©n's conference in Edinburgh. Referring to the 1995 Notification, he said Ryd√©n \\"certainly did not\\" operate with the approval of the Church and that \\"the advice to Catholics is not to attend her gatherings due to the suspect nature of her alleged revelations, which contain doctrinal errors.\\" In January 2006, Roger Mahony, the Archbishop of Los Angeles, California, approved the withdrawal of an invitation to host to a conference at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels at which the main speaker was to be Ryd√©n. Mgr. Kostelnik, pastor of the Cathedral, explained in a press release that the organizers had assured him that Ryd√©n's writings had \\"been cleared by the Vatican\\", but that he had discovered that those assurances were \\"a serious misrepresentation of the current Vatican view of Mrs Ryden's speeches and writings\\" and that the 1995 and 1996 Vatican statements cautioning Catholics against following Ryd√©n remained \\"in full force\\". On March 16, 2011, the Greek Orthodox Church and synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople issued a disapproval of her teachings and instructed all Orthodox Christians not to associate with her. The Ecumenical Patriarchate \\"denounce[d] from the Mother Church\\" Ryd√©n and her organization, \\"True Life In God\\", and refused \\"ecclesiastical communion\\" to those involved. The Synodical Committee for Matters of Heresy of the Church of Cyprus announced on January 13, 2012, that Ryd√©n's \\"teachings are heretical, and her claims that she communicates directly with Christ are fantastical and outside of the spirit of the experience of the our Church.\\" Cardinal Prosper Grech reviewed Heaven Is Real But So Is Hell and said it was an autobiography and apologia in the apocalyptic genre. Grech said that he does not know the origin of Ryd√©n's visions but that if they bring more people to God then \\"there is no reason to reject them outright.\\" In 1995, the Catholic Church's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) issued a Notification on the writings of Ryd√©n, the Notification was also printed in L'Osservatore Romano, the official Vatican newspaper. Published in L'Osservatore Romano English edition on 25 October 1995; Acta Apostolicae Sedis AAS 88 (1996) 956‚Äì957; OR 23‚Äì24.10.1995; EV 14, 1956‚Äì1957; LE 5618. The CDF stated that the \\"attentive examination of the entire question\\" had brought up \\"a number of basic elements that must be considered negative in the light of Catholic doctrine\\" as well as \\"several doctrinal errors\\". It also questioned the \\"suspect nature of the ways in which these alleged revelations have occurred\\" and considers the fact that \\"the aforementioned errors no longer appear in Ryden's later writings is a sign that the alleged heavenly messages are merely the result of private meditations\\". The Notification concludes by requesting \\"the intervention of the Bishops\\" to prevent the dissemination of Ryden's ideas in their dioceses and \\"invites all the faithful not to regard Mrs Vassula Ryden's writings and speeches as supernatural\\". In November 1996, the CDF issued a press release, stating that the Notification \\"retains all its force\\" and \\"was approved by the competent authorities and will be published in the Acta Apostolicae Sedis, the official organ of the Holy See\\". It instructed Catholics \\"not to regard the messages of Vassula Ryden as divine revelations, but only as her personal meditations\\". Cardinal Prosper Grech said he communicated to Ryd√©n in the name of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the faith in some period after 1997. He had thought the CDF was satisfied, but in a letter dated January 25, 2007, the new Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Cardinal William Levada, following continued requests for clarifications on the writings and activities of Ryd√©n, wrote to the Catholic hierarchy around the world stating that \\"the Notification of 1995 remains valid as a doctrinal judgment\\" of the writings, which should be seen as her own personal meditations and that Catholics should not take part in prayer groups established by Ryd√©n.  Lawsuit against critical website  In 2002, Maria Laura Pio, a former follower of Ryd√©n's teachings, published a website critical of Ryd√©n. The website hosted a collection of documents and interviews that were critical of Ryd√©n's teachings.\\"Legal action by Vassula Ryden shuts down critical web site\\", Catholic World News, May 11, 2012 Niels Christian Hvidt cited the website in his book Christian Prophecy: The Post-Biblical Tradition. In May 2012 the website was closed because of the threat of legal action from Ryd√©n's attorneys, who argued that the term \\"Vassula\\" was trademarked, that a website named \\"infovassula\\" must belong to Ryd√©n.\\"Vassula Ryden, condemned by Vatican in 1995 for 'doctrinal errors', uses lawsuit to shut down website of critic...\\", New Advent Pio announced on 3 May 2012, \\"I am going to close the website at the end of May and unfortunately, since I do not have the means financially nor mentally to face another lawsuit, no matter how ridiculous it is, I am constrained to hand over the domain name to Vassula in June 2012.\\"https://groups.yahoo.com/group/marialaurapio_eng/message/48 In 2013, the Catholic research group Gruppo di Ricerca e Informazione Socio- Religiosa (GRIS) obtained permission from Pio to remount the critical website under a new domain: www.pseudomystica.info.

The magnetic field was about 16 teslas. Video is available. A Bitter electromagnet or Bitter solenoid is a type of electromagnet invented in 1933 by American physicist Francis Bitter used in scientific research to create extremely strong magnetic fields. Bitter electromagnets have been used to achieve the strongest continuous manmade magnetic fields on earth‚Äïup to 45 teslas, . Advantages Bitter electromagnets are used where extremely strong fields are required. The iron cores used in conventional electromagnets saturate, and are limited to fields of about 2 teslas. Superconducting electromagnets can produce stronger magnetic fields but are limited to fields of 10 to 20 teslas, due to flux creep, though theoretical limits are higher. For stronger fields resistive solenoid electromagnets of the Bitter design are used. Their disadvantage is that they require very high drive currents, and dissipate large quantities of heat. Construction Plate from a 16T Bitter magnet, 40cm diameter, made of copper. In operation it carries a current of 20 kiloamperes Bitter magnets are constructed of circular conducting metal plates and insulating spacers stacked in a helical configuration, rather than coils of wire. The current flows in a helical path through the plates. This design was invented in 1933 by American physicist, Francis Bitter. In his honor, the plates are known as Bitter plates. The purpose of the stacked plate design is to withstand the enormous outward mechanical pressure produced by Lorentz forces due to the magnetic field acting on the moving electric charges in the plate, which increase with the square of the magnetic field strength. Additionally, water circulates through holes in the plates as a coolant, to carry away the enormous heat created in the plates due to resistive heating by the large currents flowing through them. The heat dissipation also increases with the square of the magnetic field strength. In the mid-1990s researchers at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) at Florida State University in Tallahassee improved on this basic design and created what they refer to as the Florida Bitter. By elongating the mounting and cooling holes, there is a substantial drop in the stresses developed in the system and an improvement in cooling efficiency. As the stresses increased in the original bitter plates, they would flex slightly causing the small circular cooling holes to move out of alignment reducing the efficacy of the cooling system. The Florida Bitter plates will flex less due to the reduced stresses, and the elongated cooling holes will always be in partial alignment despite any flexure the discs experience. This new design allowed for a 40% increase in efficiency and has become the design of choice for bitter plate based resistive magnets. Current density and magnetic flux density Unlike a copper wire, the current density of a current carrying disc is not uniform across its cross- sectional area, but is instead a function of the ratio of the inner diameter of the disc to an arbitrary radius within the disc. The implications of this relationship is that the current density decreases with an increase in radius. As such, the bulk of the current is flowing closer to the inner radius of the disc. Large discs (i.e., disc with a large difference between their inner and outer radius) will have a larger discrepancy in the current density between the inner and outer portions of the disc. This will reduce the efficiency and cause additional complications in the system because there will be a more substantial temperature and stress gradient along the disc. As such, a series of nested coils is often used as it will more evenly distribute the current across a large combined area as opposed to a single coil with large discs. The non-uniform current density must also be considered when calculating the magnetic flux density. Amp√®re's Law for a basic current carrying loop of wire gives that the on-axis magnetic flux is proportional to the current running through the wire and is related to the basic geometry of the loop, but is not concerned with the geometry of the cross section of the wire. The current density is uniform across the cross-sectional area of a wire. This is not the case for a Bitter disc. As such, the current term must be replaced with terms discussing the cross-sectional area of the disc and the current density. The equation for the on-axis magnetic flux density of a Bitter disc becomes much more complex as a result. The differential flux density is related to the current density and the differential area. The introduction of a space factor must be included to compensate for variations in the disc related to cooling and mounting holes. Record Bitter magnets The most powerful electromagnet in the world, the 45T hybrid Bitter-superconducting magnet at the US National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Tallahassee, Florida, USA The strongest continuous magnetic fields on Earth have been produced by Bitter magnets. the strongest continuous field achieved by a room temperature magnet is 37.5T produced by a Bitter electromagnet at the Radboud University High Field Magnet Laboratory in Nijmegen, Netherlands. The strongest continuous manmade magnetic field, 45T, was produced by a hybrid device, consisting of a Bitter magnet inside a superconducting magnet. The resistive magnet produces 33.5T and the superconducting coil produces the remaining 11.5T. This magnet requires 30MW of power. This magnet must be kept at using liquid helium. The magnet takes 6 weeks to cool to temperature and thus once cooled the cooling system is run continuously. It costs $1452 per hour to run at full field.

The project was intended to build sports prototypes for the World Endurance Championship and IMSA GT Championship using Aston Martin V8 engines. Although Aston Martin did not own the project, they offered their support for the chance to see success for their name in motorsports without the heavy cost of running their own team. NRA/C2 A privateer NRA/C2. Nimrod built three NRA/C2s for competition in 1982, with two being run by the works team while the third was sold to Dawnay Racing, a team owned by the then AMOC president Viscount Downe. The cars were capable of running both in the World Endurance Championship's Group C specification and IMSA GT's GTP specification. Combining a production- based V8 engine from the V8 and V8 Vantage models, the engine was refined by Aston Martin Tickford to handle the increased output. Eric Broadley designed the chassis while his employer Lola Cars International built the tubs. Ray Mallock would later evolve the NRA/C2's design into a B-spec model for the 1983 season. Team history Debuting at the 1000 km of Silverstone, Nimrod entered one of their own cars alongside the Dawnay Racing privateer entry. Nimrod faced mechanical troubles and did not finish, although Viscount Downe had a sixth-place finish. Problems continued for Nimrod Racing at the 24 Hours of Le Mans where their race was ended early with an accident. Nimrod's only success for the season came at the 1000km Spa, where one of their two cars finished, taking eleventh place. The combined results of Nimrod and Viscount Downe earned Aston Martin third in the constructors championship that year. For 1982, with the evolved NRA/C2, Nimrod Racing would turn to the IMSA GT Championship in North America due to EMKA Racing taking over Aston Martin's factory-backed efforts in Europe with their own car. Nimrod suffered throughout the season, earning their only success as the 12 Hours of Sebring with a fifth-place finish, third in the GTP class. The team would struggle to finish races for the rest of the season before financial trouble eventually forced them to return to Europe. Following their disappointing return to Europe, Nimrod Racing Automobiles closed due to continued financial troubles, ending the short life of the project. A new chassis had been under development at the time, known as NRA/C3, yet was never completed before the team was dissolved. Privateers continued to use Nimrod's NRA/C2 until the 1984 24 Hours of Le Mans, where two cars ran by Dawnay racing were destroyed in a fiery crash at the Mulsanne straight.

The code name for the project was DP K901. Initially, a production run of 15‚Äì25 cars was planned, but the project was deemed too costly and only one was built.  History  The Bulldog - named after a Scottish Aviation Bulldog aeroplane flown by Aston Martin's then managing director, Alan Curtis, but nicknamed \\"K9\\", after the robotic dog from the Doctor Who TV series \\\\- was designed to show off the capabilities of Aston Martin's new engineering facility in Newport Pagnell, as well as to chase after the title of fastest production car in the world. The car was officially launched on 27 March 1980 at the Bell Hotel at Aston Clinton. Although the car was built in the UK, it is left-hand-drive. The Bulldog's sharp wedge shape was designed by William Towns. The car has five centre-mounted, hidden headlamps and gull-wing doors. The interior is upholstered in leather with walnut trim and uses multiple LED buttons like the Lagonda. Aston Martin planned to build 15-25 Bulldogs, but in 1981 Victor Gauntlett became chairman of the company and decided the project would be too costly, so the Bulldog project was shelved. In 1984 Aston Martin sold the Bulldog to a middle eastern collector for ¬£130,000. The owner added both rear view mirrors and cameras. The Bulldog later was sold to an American collector and spent some time in the United States; it was later in storage in different places. It was shown at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in 2009, and at Aston Martin's 100th anniversary celebration at Kensington Park Gardens in July 2013. It was found in storage in the Far East, and offered for sale in Britain. It was now green, compared to original exterior colours of silver and light grey. The interior had also been changed from the original dark brown and black to light tan. In 2020 the car was purchased by an American owner, and a full restoration project managed by Victor Gauntlett's son Richard was set up.  Performance  The front end of the Bulldog featured five centre- mounted hidden headlamps. The Bulldog is powered by a 5.3L V8 engine with twin Garrett turbochargers that produces 600 bhp (447 kW; 608 PS)‚Äîthe engine was capable of 700 bhp (522 kW; 710 PS) on the test bed‚Äîand maximum torque. When it came out, Aston Martin claimed the car was capable of 237 mph (381 km/h), but the fastest speed the car was recorded doing was a verified 192 mph (307 km/h) during a test run at the Motor Industry Research Association track in late 1979. The wedge-shaped design gave the Bulldog a drag coefficient of 0.34.

It was published by Tor Books and released on October 15, 1993. It is the first novel in the series to not involve an appearance by each of the three ta'veren from the Two Rivers, due to Perrin's absence. The Fires of Heaven consists of a prologue and 56 chapters. Plot summary Devastated by Rand al'Thor's revelation of their true history, the Shaido Aiel attack Cairhien, with the aid of the Forsaken Sammael. Rand prepares to attack the Shaido but first spends time in the Aiel Waste, learning from the former Forsaken Asmodean and becoming closer to the Aiel Maiden Aviendha. In the same area, Egwene al'Vere continues her studies under the Aiel Wise Ones. Later, Rand leads his Aiel forces to defeat the Shaido, in the Second Battle of Cairhien. Mat Cauthon uses his memories of past generals to act as a commander and win numerous battles, eventually killing the Shaido leader Couladin, whereupon the Shaido Aiel retreat. Following Elaida's coup in the White Tower, she names Alviarin as her keeper and resolves to capture Rand. Meanwhile, the Aes Sedai who oppose her establish themselves in Salidar. Learning this, Min Farshaw, Siuan Sanche, Leane Sharif, and Logain Ablar travel to Salidar. A suspicious Gareth Bryne pursues them, but after learning the situation, he forms a tentative alliance with the Salidar Aes Sedai. Nynaeve al'Meara and Elayne Trakand, along with Thom Merrilin and Juilin Sandar, flee the chaos of Tarabon and also travel towards Salidar. Along the way, they face many dangers such as Whitecloaks, Moghedien, and Masema Dagar, who now calls himself Rand's \\"prophet\\". Along the way, the hero Birgitte is expelled from Tel'aran'rhiod and joins the group, and Elayne learns how to create ter'angreal. They eventually reach Salidar with the help of Galad Damodred, who is now a Whitecloak. The Forsaken Rahvin, masquerading as Lord Gaebril, has been mind-controlling Queen Morgase Trakand of Andor. She realizes this and escapes, but she is falsely proclaimed dead and Rahvin replaces her as ruler of Andor. To remove Rahvin from power, Rand prepares a small Aiel strike force to invade Caemlyn. Before he can do so, Lanfear attempts to kill him; but Moiraine Damodred grabs Lanfear and both topple through a ter'angreal, which is then destroyed, and both presumed dead. Thereafter Rand attacks Caemlyn, but his channeling triggers a trap set by Rahvin that kills all of his companions. Rand chases Rahvin into Tel'aran'rhiod. Nynaeve, who is battling Moghedien in Tel'aran'rhiod, is almost defeated, but with the help of Birgitte, traps Moghedien in an a'dam. Nynaeve then uses Moghedien's power to aid Rand in his battle. Rand then destroys him with a tremendous burst of balefire, which revives Mat, Aviendha, and Asmodean. However, Asmodean is murdered almost immediately afterwards by an unknown assailant.

Biography Born in Sarajevo, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, SFR Yugoslavia, Jergoviƒá received his M.A. in literature from the Sarajevo University. While at high-school, he started working as a journalist in printed and electronic media, as a contributor to literary and youth magazines, and was soon recognized as Croatia's media correspondent from Sarajevo. Writing Jergoviƒá's novels treat his family members and their histories. He is also a journalist and has published a collection of his articles in Historijska ƒçitanka (A Reader in History, 1996). Jergoviƒá writes a column in the Serbian daily Politika, for Vreme magazine and a regular column in the Croatian daily Jutarnji list entitled Sumnjivo lice (trans. \\"suspicious character\\", lit. \\"suspicious face\\"). Works His novel Buick Riviera was made into a movie in 2008 by filmmaker Goran Ru≈°inoviƒá, and the two were in turn awarded the Golden Arena for Best Screenplay. According to the author himself, it is a \\"novella\\" set in North American countryside, dealing with the conflict of a Serbian refugee from Bosnia, probably a war criminal, and a Muslim refugee who had spent twenty years in the United States. Its heroes, who always carry with them their native lore, their religion and their mentality, though they have numerous reasons for feelings of love and understanding of others, become victims of their own inability to rise above their national background, above their old hatreds and the burden of historical conflicts. Miljenko Jergovic wrote another novel or \\"documented diary\\" ‚Äì \\"Volga, Volga\\", a book about car and his driver. This is a complicated story about guilt and death, the Yugoslav war and internal conflicts. And as is Jergovic great storyteller, he starts with what the outside: Volga is not only black but glossy black like the piano. Reading the book makes reader realize the main effect of storytelling: war destroys, stories are kept. Focal characteristics of the book are desire and strangeness, sadness and anger. Jergoviƒá‚Äô car is a\\"documentary fantasy\\" and the story is about the generation living a lie. Jergoviƒá‚Äô Yugoslavia lost in dreams of acting, the desire for truth is opposed illusions and dreams, lies and legends. Jergovic the master of melancholy presents driving as a journey into the past, awakens memories of the companions, the times of sadness and loneliness. Central figure in the novel is Jalal Pljevljak, who is the experienced driver and a Muslim believer, whose faith prohibits the consumption of alcohol, drunk, and so risked disaster. Although the reader gets the key to a mysterious accident, second impression prevails much greater issue: the uncertainty about where the boundaries between fact, facts, legends, dreams and lies. The truth about things, it shows the contrasting perspectives of game storytelling, not just a matter of personal integrity and identity. Thus, the author briefly illuminates the history of the former Yugoslavia. As the scene of religious, ethnic and political relations and conflict former multinational federation determines the flow and actions, so, for example, accused Pljevljak, for example, both Croat and Muslim. At the end of the wars in the nineties it was very popular among intellectuals and yellow press to relativize the guilt of the pre-war crime and surrender it to forgetfulness. So, the case Pljevljak for a reader is a metaphor of the fate of the whole country., Literary circles Jergoviƒá at the Kulturhaus in Graz, Austria, 23 March 2015 A number of private conflicts in literary circles drew public attention to disagreement among famous writers. Namely, issues in the Croatian Writers' Society created fragmentation and an alleged unjust disqualification of writers on political grounds. Over the course of his career, Jergoviƒá was involved in these issues, as were many other noteworthy writers. In October 2002, Jergoviƒá was elected to the Croatian Writers' Society board of directors. In 2003, there was criticism that one of CWS founders, Velimir Viskoviƒá, was judging CWS members on political grounds. This was revealed when Drago ≈†tambuk pointed out Viskoviƒá's former association with HDZ government. In April 2006, Jergoviƒá became involved in a literary dispute with Dra≈æen Katunariƒá over Jergoviƒá's text on Houellebecqu, which Jergoviƒá's considered charlatan for being based on the Qur'an. Katunariƒá said that such texts with a Sarajevan and Islamic basis are not accepted in Zagreb. To which Jergoviƒá responded for him to put a gun to his head. This controversy encouraged Zdravko Zima to resign his membership in the Croatian Writers' Society because he felt the leadership wasn't distancing themselves from the attacks on Katunariƒá. In April 2007, Jergoviƒá himself withdrew from CWS. Jergoviƒá said that the society contrasted his attitude to Croatian literature and literature in general. A number of other writers cut ties with the association in a similar fashion, including Ivan Lovrenoviƒá who resigned because he felt Velimir Viskoviƒá's disqualification called for the real and symbolic dismissal of Jergoviƒá in 2011. In 2009, Viskoviƒá made public claims about Jergoviƒá reaffirming Chetniks in Serbia and setting out to market books for a Serbian market. Viskoviƒá made these claims in response to an interview Jergoviƒá gave. Some questioned whether the reason for the conflict with Jergoviƒá was Viskoviƒá's life project ‚Äì the Encyclopedia of Croatian Literature. When CWS members asked Viskoviƒá to apologize, he refused, citing years of insults to him, his family and other prominent writers. Personal life Born in Sarajevo in 1966, Jergoviƒá spent half of his life in his hometown. He even spent the first year of the Bosnian War, more precisely the Siege of Sarajevo there, before moving to Zagreb in 1993. Jergoviƒá has been known as an avid supporter of Sarajevo football club FK ≈Ωeljezniƒçar, whose fan he has been since he was even a kid, even having a membership card of the club as well, renewing it in July 2019. Awards In 2012, he received the Angelus Central European Literature Award for his book Srda pjeva, u sumrak, na Duhove (\\"Srda Sings at Dusk On Pentecost\\") and in 2018 he won the Georg Dehio Book Prize.

It is common in woodworking, metalworking, and other similar trade and hobby tasks. Most are hand tools, made of a case hardened steel bar of rectangular, square, triangular, or round cross-section, with one or more surfaces cut with sharp, generally parallel teeth. A narrow, pointed tang is common at one end, to which a handle may be fitted.. A rasp is a form of file with distinct, individually cut teeth used for coarsely removing large amounts of material.Facts about Files Files have also been developed with abrasive surfaces, such as natural or synthetic diamond grains or silicon carbide, allowing removal of material that would dull or resist metal, such as ceramic.  History  Early filing or rasping has prehistoric roots and grew naturally out of the blending of the twin inspirations of cutting with stone cutting tools (such as hand axes) and abrading using natural abrasives, such as well- suited types of stone (for example, sandstone)., pp. 5‚Äì15. Relatedly, lapping is also quite ancient, with wood and beach sand offering a natural pair of lap and lapping compound. The Disston authors state, \\"To abrade, or file, ancient man used sand, grit, coral, bone, fish skin, and gritty woods,‚Äîalso stone of varying hardness in connection with sand and water.\\", p. 5. The Bronze Age and the Iron Age had various kinds of files and rasps. Archaeologists have discovered rasps made from bronze in Egypt, dating back to the years 1200‚Äì1000 BC. Archaeologists have also discovered rasps made of iron used by the Assyrians, dating back to the 7th Century BC. During the Middle Ages files were already quite advanced, thanks to the extensive talents of blacksmiths., pp. 16‚Äì17. By the 11th century, there already existed hardened files that would seem quite modern even to today's eyes. But although they existed, and could even have spread widely, in a geographical sense, via trade, they were not widespread in the cultural sense of the word‚Äîthat is, most people, and even many smiths, did not have them. For example, in the 13th century, ornamental iron work at Paris was done skillfully with the aid of files, but the process was a secret known only to a master craftsman. The Disston authors state, \\"It was not until the fourteenth century, however, that those who practiced art in ironwork began to use other tools, besides heat and the hammer, regularly.\\" This statement could mislead in the sense that stoning (with sandstone) and lapping (with wood, sand, and water) have never been rare activities among humans, or especially smiths. But the point is that modern iron or steel files, with teeth and hardening, and the material culture of intricate filing that would lead to locksmithing and gunsmithing, for example, are what took time to become common. But by the late Middle Ages, the transition was extensive. The Disston authors mention Nuremberg, Sheffield, and Remscheid (they use the Reimscheid spelling) as leading centers of production for files as well as tools in general. The activity in Remscheid reflects the metalworking spirit of the Rhine-Ruhr region in general (including Essen, D√ºsseldorf, and Cologne) rather than representing a single village of geniuses in isolation. (Considering the Disston authors' mention of the blacksmith guilds of 13th-century Florence and 15th-century England, coupled with their mention of Nuremberg, Sheffield, and Remscheid, the region that sweeps from Florence through Nuremberg, the Rhine-Ruhr, the Netherlands, and up to Sheffield, can be compared to the modern economics notation of the Blue Banana.) Most files of the period were smithed by hand in a sequence in which the iron was forged (heated and hammered), then the teeth were cut with a chisel (some of this action was just as much upsetting/swaging as it was cutting), and then the piece was hardened (by heating and then quenching), followed sometimes by tempering. Among the drawings of Leonardo da Vinci is a sketch of a machine tool for the cutting of files (the chisel would make one strike, swaging a tooth, then automatically advance into position for the next tooth, and strike again). Prior to the industrialization of machining and the development of interchangeable parts during the 19th century, filing was much more important in the construction of mechanisms. Component parts were roughly shaped by forging, casting, and by primitive machining operations. These components were then individually hand-fitted for assembly by careful and deliberate filing. The potential precision of such fitting is much higher than generally assumed, but the components of such hand-fit assemblies are decidedly not interchangeable with those from another assembly. Locks, clocks, and firearms (flintlocks and earlier) were manufactured in this way for centuries before the Industrial Revolution. Machining in the mid-19th century was heavily dependent on filing, because milling practice was slowly evolving out of its infancy. As late as the early 20th century, manufacturing often involved filing parts to precise shape and size. In today's manufacturing environment, milling and grinding have generally replaced this type of work, and filing (when it occurs at all) usually tends to be for deburring only. Skillful filing to shape and size is still a part of diemaking, moldmaking, toolmaking, etc., but even in those fields, the goal is usually to avoid handwork when possible.  Types  Relative tooth sizes for smooth, 2nd cut and bastard files Files come in a wide variety of materials, sizes, shapes, cuts, and tooth configurations. The cross-section of a file can be flat, round, half-round, triangular, square, knife edge or of a more specialized shape. Steel files are made from high carbon steel (1.0 to 1.25% carbon) and may be through hardened or case hardened. Note that the reference actually states that they are hardened to 40 HRC, but the HRC scale is commonly incorrectly used on case hardened surfaces, so the value has been converted to the correct superficial Rockwell scale. There is no unitary international standard for file nomenclature; however, there are many generally accepted names for certain kinds of files. A file is \\"blunt\\" if its sides and width are both parallel throughout its length. It is \\"tapered\\" if there is a reduction in its dimensions from its heel toward its point. A file may taper in width, in thickness, or both. A \\"tang\\" is a protrusion at the heel, tapered, parallel sided, or conical, for gripping, inserting in a handle, or mounting in a chuck. The cut of the file refers to how fine its teeth are. They are defined as (from roughest to smoothest): rough, middle, bastard, second cut, smooth, and dead smooth. A single-cut file has one set of parallel teeth while a cross-cut or double-cut file has a second set of cuts forming diamond shaped cutting surfaces. In Swiss-pattern files the teeth are cut at a shallower angle, and are graded by number, with a number 1 file being coarser than a number 2, etc. Most files have teeth on all faces, but some specialty flat files have teeth on only one face or one edge, so that the user can come right up to another edge without damaging the finish on it. Some of the common shapes and their uses: { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\\" + File Types and Uses - ! Name ! Image ! Description - !

Combination file   Tangless, flat sided or half-round, with two to four cutting surfaces, typically including a combination of single cut, double cut, or rasp } * Barrette files are tapered in width and thickness, coming to a rounded point at the end. Only the flat side is cut, and the other sides are all safe. For doing flat work. * Checkering files parallel in width and gently tapered in thickness. They have teeth cut in a precise grid pattern, and are used for making serrations and doing checkering work, as on gunstocks. * Crochet files are tapered in width and gradually tapered in thickness, with two flats and radiused edges, cut all around. Used in filing junctions between flat and curved surface, and slots with rounded edges. * Crossing files are half round on two sides with one side having a larger radius than the other. Tapered in width and thickness. For filing interior curved surfaces. The double radius makes possible filing at the junction of two curved surfaces or a straight and curved surface. * Dreadnought (curved teeth) and millenicut (straight teeth) files both have heavily undercut, sharp but coarse teeth. Both can be used for rapidly removing large quantities of material from thick aluminum alloy, copper or brass. Today, the millenicut and dreadnought have found a new use in removing plastic filler materials such as two-part epoxies or styrenes such as those commonly used in automobile body repairs. * Equalling files are parallel in width and thickness. Used for filing slots and corners. * Farrier Rasp files are tanged rasps used mainly by farriers and blacksmiths. They are flat with a rasp on one side and double cut on the reverse. * Fret files are square or rectangular with three flat sides and one side having a concave groove. They are used by luthiers to file a rounded \\"crown\\" on the frets of guitars and other fretted instruments. The flat faces are used to dress the ends of the frets, removing the sharp edges left after the frets are trimmed to length. *Half round ring files taper in width and thickness, coming to a point, and are narrower than a standard half round. Used for filing inside of rings. *Joint round edge files are parallel in width and thickness, with rounded edges. The flats are safe (no teeth) and cut on the rounded edges only. Used for making joints and hinges. * Knife files are tapered in width and thickness, but the knife edge has the same thickness the whole length, with the knife edge having an arc to it. Used for slotting or wedging operations. * Nut files are fine, precise files in sets of graduated thickness, used by luthiers for dressing the slots at the end of the neck which support the strings of guitars, violins etc., in the correct position. * Pillar files are parallel in width and tapered in thickness for perfectly flat filing. Double cut top and bottom with both sides safe, these are long, narrow files for precision work. * Pippin files are tapered in width and thickness, generally of a teardrop cross section and having the edge of a knife file. Used for filing the junction of two curved surfaces and making V-shaped slots. *Planemaker's float Floats are straight, single-cut files which taper used for cutting, flattening and smoothing wood, particularly in making wooden hand planes. * Round parallel files are similar to round files, except that they do not taper. Shaped like a toothed cylinder. * Saw sharpening files are usually single cut to deliver a smooth finish. They are suited to sharpening saw blades and dressing tool edges, especially where a finer, sharper edge or smoother surface finish is desired. The Chainsaw file is one example, used primarily for sharpening chainsaws. These appear to have a round cross- section, but are actually shaped to fit snugly against the cutting edge of a chainsaw's teeth. * Slitting files are parallel in width with a diamond-shaped cross section. Thinner than knife files and use for filing slots. * Warding files are parallel in thickness, tapered in width, and thin. Like a hand or flat file that comes to a point on the end. Used for flat work and slotting. = Diamond files = A selection of diamond impregnated files Instead of having teeth cut into the file's working surface, diamond files have small particles of industrial diamond embedded in their surface (or into a softer material that is bonded to the underlying surface of the file). The use of diamonds in this manner allows the file to be used effectively against extremely hard materials, such as stone, glass or very hard metals such as hardened steel or carbide against which a standard steel file is ineffective. Diamond files are also the only type that may be used with a back-and-forth motion without damaging the file. These may also be called diamond laps, as the \\"teeth\\" are not regular projections, as in a file, but particles, usually shaped and located randomly and held in place by a softer (any other) material. = Needle files = A needle file set depicting various shapes, from top to bottom: pillar, half round, barrette, square, round, triangular. The image to the left shows a selection of needle files in an assortment of cross sectional shapes. Needle files are small files that are used in applications where the surface finish takes priority over metal removal rates but they are most suited for smaller work pieces. They are often sold in sets, including different shapes. = Riffler files = A selection of riffler files Riffler files are small to medium-sized files in an assortment of cross sectional shapes and profiles. The varying profiles and shapes enable them to be used in hard to reach, or unusually shaped areas. They are often used as an intermediate step in die making where the surface finish of a cavity die may need to be improved, e.g. in plastic injection moulding or die casting. = Machine files = A selection of machine files Files are produced specifically for use in a filing machine, which is similar in appearance to a scroll saw with a vertically reciprocating file mounted in the middle of a table. A workpiece is manipulated around the file's face as the shape requires. A cone point (as pictured in the top and bottom files at left) allows a file to center itself in its mount. Files with flat mounting surfaces must be secured with set screws. Filing machines are rarely seen in modern production environments, but may be found in older toolrooms or diemaking shops as an aid in the manufacture of specialist tooling. = Escapement files = Escapement files, also known as watchmaker's files, are a classification of short, (very) thin files with bastard-cut or embedded diamond surfaces, similar to needle files in form and function but smaller. Typical dimensions are on the order of approximately 100‚Äì140 mm (4‚Äì5 in.) in length and 3‚Äì5 mm (‚Äì in.) in width. Best used for fine, delicate work on small pieces or mechanisms (such as escapements), escapement files are commonly used by clock and watchmakers, as well as in crafting jewelry. = Dental files = During root canal therapy, round files ranging from diameter files are used to smooth the narrow canals of the interior of the tooth and thus facilitate disinfection of the internal surface. Typically the files are made of stainless steel or nickel titanium (NiTi) and come in a variety of styles. Mechanized files, known as rotary files, are also commonly used. These files attach to the head of a specific oscillating or rotating drill.Walton, Richard E. Principles and Practice of Endodontics, 3rd Edition. Saunders Book Company, 012002. Page 212.  Use  Files have forward-facing cutting teeth, and cut most effectively when pushed over the workpiece. A variety of strokes are employed to stabilize the cutting action and produce a varied result. Pulling a file directly backwards on a workpiece will cause the teeth to dull. Draw filing is an operation in which the file is grasped at each end, and with an even pressure alternately pulled and pushed perpendicularly over the work. A variation involves laying the file sideways on the work, and carefully pushing or pulling it across the work. This catches the teeth of the file sideways instead of head on, and a very fine shaving action is produced. There are also varying strokes that produce a combination of the straight ahead stroke and the drawfiling stroke, and very fine work can be attained in this fashion. Using a combination of strokes, and progressively finer files, a skilled operator can attain a surface that is perfectly flat and near mirror finish. Pinning refers to the clogging of the file teeth with pins, which are material shavings. These pins cause the file to lose its cutting ability and can scratch the workpiece. A file card, which is a brush with metal bristles, is used to clean the file. (The name, \\"card\\", is the same as used for the \\"raising cards\\" (spiked brushes) used in woolmaking.) Chalk can help prevent pinning..

Glucokinase occurs in cells in the liver and pancreas of humans and most other vertebrates. In each of these organs it plays an important role in the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism by acting as a glucose sensor, triggering shifts in metabolism or cell function in response to rising or falling levels of glucose, such as occur after a meal or when fasting. Mutations of the gene for this enzyme can cause unusual forms of diabetes or hypoglycemia. Glucokinase (GK) is a hexokinase isozyme, related homologously to at least three other hexokinases. All of the hexokinases can mediate phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), which is the first step of both glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. However, glucokinase is coded by a separate gene and its distinctive kinetic properties allow it to serve a different set of functions. Glucokinase has a lower affinity for glucose than the other hexokinases do, and its activity is localized to a few cell types, leaving the other three hexokinases as more important preparers of glucose for glycolysis and glycogen synthesis for most tissues and organs. Because of this reduced affinity, the activity of glucokinase, under usual physiological conditions, varies substantially according to the concentration of glucose. Nomenclature Alternative names for this enzyme are: human hexokinase IV, hexokinase D, and ATP:D-hexose 6-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.1 (previously 2.7.1.2). The common name, glucokinase, is derived from its relative specificity for glucose under physiologic conditions. Some biochemists have argued that the name glucokinase should be abandoned as misleading, as this enzyme can phosphorylate other hexoses in the right conditions, and there are distantly related enzymes in bacteria with more absolute specificity for glucose that better deserve the name and the EC 2.7.1.2. Nevertheless, glucokinase remains the name preferred in the contexts of medicine and mammalian physiology. Another mammalian glucose kinase, ADP- specific glucokinase, was discovered in 2004. The gene is distinct and similar to that of primitive organisms. It is dependent on ADP rather than ATP (suggesting the possibility of more effective function during hypoxia), and the metabolic role and importance remain to be elucidated. Catalysis = Substrates and products= The principal substrate of physiologic importance of glucokinase is glucose, and the most important product is glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). The other necessary substrate, from which the phosphate is derived, is adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is converted to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) when the phosphate is removed. The reaction catalyzed by glucokinase is: Action of glucokinase on glucose ATP participates in the reaction in a form complexed to magnesium (Mg) as a cofactor. Furthermore, under certain conditions, glucokinase, like other hexokinases, can induce phosphorylation of other hexoses (6 carbon sugars) and similar molecules. Therefore, the general glucokinase reaction is more accurately described as: ::Hexose + ‚Üí hexose- + + Among the hexose substrates are mannose, fructose, and glucosamine, but the affinity of glucokinase for these requires concentrations not found in cells for significant activity. =Kinetics= Two important kinetic properties distinguish glucokinase from the other hexokinases, allowing it to function in a special role as glucose sensor. # Glucokinase has a lower affinity for glucose than the other hexokinases. Glucokinase changes conformation and/or function in parallel with rising glucose concentrations in the physiologically important range of 4‚Äì10 mmol/L (72‚Äì180 mg/dl). It is half-saturated at a glucose concentration of about 8 mmol/L (144 mg/dl). # Glucokinase is not inhibited by its product, glucose-6-phosphate. This allows continued signal output (e.g., to trigger insulin release) amid significant amounts of its product These two features allow it to regulate a \\"supply-driven\\" metabolic pathway. That is, the rate of reaction is driven by the supply of glucose, not by the demand for end products. Another distinctive property of glucokinase is its moderate cooperativity with glucose, with a Hill coefficient (nH) of about 1.7. Glucokinase has only a single binding site for glucose and is the only monomeric regulatory enzyme known to display substrate cooperativity. The nature of the cooperativity has been postulated to involve a \\"slow transition\\" between two different enzyme states with different rates of activity. If the dominant state depends upon glucose concentration, it would produce an apparent cooperativity similar to that observed. Because of this cooperativity, the kinetic interaction of glucokinase with glucose does not follow classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Rather than a Km for glucose, it is more accurate to describe a half-saturation level S0.5, which is the concentration at which the enzyme is 50% saturated and active. The S0.5 and nH extrapolate to an \\"inflection point\\" of the curve describing enzyme activity as a function of glucose concentration at about 4 mmol/L. In other words, at a glucose concentration of about 72 mg/dl, which is near the low end of the normal range, glucokinase activity is most sensitive to small changes in glucose concentration. The kinetic relationship with the other substrate, MgATP, can be described by classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with an affinity at about 0.3‚Äì0.4 mmol/L, well below a typical intracellular concentration of 2.5 mmol/L. The fact that there is nearly always an excess of ATP available implies that ATP concentration rarely influences glucokinase activity. The maximum specific activity (kcat, also known as the turnover rate) of glucokinase when saturated with both substrates is 62/s. The pH optimum of human glucokinase was identified only recently and is surprisingly high, at pH 8.5-8.7. A \\"minimal mathematical model\\" has been devised based on the above kinetic information to predict the beta cell glucose phosphorylation rate (BGPR) of normal (\\"wild type\\") glucokinase and the known mutations. The BGPR for wild type glucokinase is about 28% at a glucose concentration of 5 mmol/l, indicating that the enzyme is running at 28% of capacity at the usual threshold glucose for triggering insulin release. =Mechanism= The sulfhydryl groups of several cysteines surround the glucose binding site. All except cys 230 are essential for the catalytic process, forming multiple disulfide bridges during interaction with the substrates and regulators. At least in the beta cells, the ratio of active to inactive glucokinase molecules is at least partly determined by the balance of oxidation of sulfhydryl groups or reduction of disulfide bridges. These sulfhydryl groups are quite sensitive to the oxidation status of the cells, making glucokinase one of the components most vulnerable to oxidative stress, especially in the beta cells. =Interactive pathway map=  Structure  {style=\\"float: right\\"  } Glucokinase is a monomeric protein of 465 amino acids and a molecular weight of about 50 kD. There are at least two clefts, one for the active site, binding glucose and MgATP, and the other for a putative allosteric activator that has not yet been identified. This is about half the size of the other mammalian hexokinases, which retain a degree of dimeric structure. Several sequences and the three-dimensional structure of the key active sites. The ATP binding domain, for example, are shared with hexokinases, bacterial glucokinases, and other proteins, and the common structure is termed an actin fold. Genetics Human glucokinase is coded for by the GCK gene on chromosome 7. This single autosomal gene has 10 exons. Genes for glucokinase in other animals are homologous to human GCK. A distinctive feature of the gene is that it begins with two promoter regions. The first exon from the 5' end contains two tissue-specific promoter regions. Transcription can begin at either promoter (depending on the tissue) so that the same gene can produce a slightly different molecule in liver and in other tissues. The two isoforms of glucokinase differ only by 13‚Äì15 amino acids at the N-terminal end of the molecule, which produces only a minimal difference in structure. The two isoforms have the same kinetic and functional characteristics. The first promoter from the 5' end, referred to as the \\"upstream\\" or neuroendocrine promoter, is active in pancreatic islet cells, neural tissue, and enterocytes (small intestine cells) to produce the \\"neuroendocrine isoform\\" of glucokinase. The second promoter, the \\"downstream\\" or liver promoter, is active in hepatocytes and directs production of the \\"liver isoform.\\" The two promoters have little or no sequence homology and are separated by a 30 kbp sequence which has not yet been shown to incur any functional differences between isoforms. The two promoters are functionally exclusive and governed by distinct sets of regulatory factors, so that glucokinase expression can be regulated separately in different tissue types. The two promoters correspond to two broad categories of glucokinase function: In liver, glucokinase acts as the gateway for the \\"bulk processing\\" of available glucose, while, in the neuroendocrine cells, it acts as a sensor, triggering cell responses that affect body-wide carbohydrate metabolism. Distribution among organ systems Glucokinase has been discovered in specific cells in four types of mammalian tissue: liver, pancreas, small intestine, and brain. All play crucial roles in responding to rising or falling levels of blood glucose. *The predominant cells of the liver are the hepatocytes, and GK is found exclusively in these cells. During digestion of a carbohydrate meal, when blood glucose is plentiful and insulin levels are high, hepatocytes remove glucose from the blood and store it as glycogen. After completion of digestion and absorption, the liver manufactures glucose from both non-glucose substrates (gluconeogenesis) and glycogen (glycogenolysis), and exports it into the blood, to maintain adequate blood glucose levels during fasting. Because GK activity rises rapidly as the glucose concentration rises, it serves as a central metabolic switch to shift hepatic carbohydrate metabolism between fed and fasting states. Phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate by GK facilitates storage of glucose as glycogen and disposal by glycolysis. The separate liver promoter allows glucokinase to be regulated differently in hepatocytes than in the neuroendocrine cells. *Neuroendocrine cells of the pancreas, gut, and brain share some common aspects of glucokinase production, regulation, and function. These tissues are collectively referred to as \\"neuroendocrine\\" cells in this context. **Beta cells and alpha cells of the pancreatic islets ***Beta cells release insulin in response to rising levels of glucose. Insulin enables many types of cells to import and use glucose, and signals the liver to synthesize glycogen. Alpha cells produce less glucagon in response to rising glucose levels, and more glucagon if blood glucose is low. Glucagon serves as a signal to the liver to break down glycogen and release glucose into the blood. Glucokinase in beta cells serves as a glucose sensor, amplifying insulin secretion as blood glucose rises. ***In the pancreatic beta-cell, glucokinase is a key regulator enzyme. Glucokinase is very important in the regulation of insulin secretion and has been known as the pancreatic beta-cell sensor. Mutations in the gene encoding glucokinase can cause both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia because of its central role in the regulation of insulin release. **Glucose-sensitive neurons of the hypothalamus ***In response to rising or falling levels of glucose, cells in the hypothalamus polarize or depolarize. Among the neuroendocrine reactions of the central nervous system to hypoglycemia is activation of the adrenergic responses of the autonomic nervous system. Glucokinase likely serves as a glucose signal here as well. Glucokinase has also been found in cells of the anterior pituitary. **Enterocytes of the small intestine ***This is the least- understood of the glucokinase sensor systems. It seems likely that responses to incoming glucose during digestion play a role in the incretin amplification of insulin secretion during a meal, or in the generation of satiety signals from gut to brain. Distribution among species Liver glucokinase occurs widely but not universally throughout vertebrate species. The gene structure and amino acid sequence are highly conserved among most mammals (e.g., rat and human glucokinase is more than 80% homologous). However, there are some unusual exceptions: For example, it has not been discovered in cats and bats, though some reptiles, birds, amphibians, and fish have it. Whether glucokinase occurs similarly in the pancreas and other organs has not yet been determined. It has been postulated that the presence of glucokinase in liver reflects the ease with which carbohydrates can be included in the animals' diets. Function and regulation Most of the glucokinase in a mammal is found in the liver, and glucokinase provides approximately 95% of the hexokinase activity in hepatocytes. Phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) by glucokinase is the first step of both glycogen synthesis and glycolysis in the liver. When ample glucose is available, glycogen synthesis proceeds at the periphery of the hepatocytes until the cells are replete with glycogen. Excess glucose is then increasingly converted into triglycerides for export and storage in adipose tissue. Glucokinase activity in the cytoplasm rises and falls with available glucose. G6P, the product of glucokinase, is the principal substrate of glycogen synthesis, and glucokinase has a close functional and regulatory association with glycogen synthesis. When maximally active, GK and glycogen synthase appears to be located in the same peripheral areas of hepatocyte cytoplasm in which glycogen synthesis occurs. The supply of G6P affects the rate of glycogen synthesis not only as the primary substrate, but by direct stimulation of glycogen synthase and inhibition of glycogen phosphorylase. Glucokinase activity can be rapidly amplified or damped in response to changes in the glucose supply, typically resulting from eating and fasting. Regulation occurs at several levels and speeds, and is influenced by many factors that affect mainly two general mechanisms: #Glucokinase activity can be amplified or reduced in minutes by actions of the glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP). The actions of this protein are influenced by small molecules such as glucose and fructose. #The amount of glucokinase can be increased by synthesis of new protein. Insulin is the principal signal for increased transcription, operating mainly by way of a transcription factor called sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP1c) except in the liver. This occurs within an hour after a rise in insulin levels, as after a carbohydrate meal. =Transcriptional= Insulin acting via the sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP1c) is thought to be the most important direct activator of glucokinase gene transcription in hepatocytes. SREBP1c is a basic helix-loop-helix zipper (bHLHZ) transactivator. This class of transactivators bind to the \\"E box\\" sequence of genes for a number of regulatory enzymes. The liver promoter in the first exon of the glucokinase gene includes such an E box, which appears to be the principal insulin-response element of the gene in hepatocytes. It was previously thought that SREBP1c must be present for transcription of glucokinase in hepatocytes however, it was recently shown that glucokinase transcription was carried out normally in SREBP1c knock out mice. SREBP1c increases in response to a high-carbohydrate diet, presumed as a direct effect of frequent insulin elevation. Increased transcription can be detected in less than an hour after hepatocytes are exposed to rising insulin levels. Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate () also stimulates GK transcription, it seems by way of Akt2 rather than SREBP1c. It is not known whether this effect is one of the downstream effects of activation of insulin receptors or independent of insulin action. Levels of play other amplifying roles in glycolysis in hepatocytes. Other transacting factors suspected of playing a role in liver cell transcription regulation include: # Hepatic nuclear factor-4-alpha (HNF4Œ±) is an orphan nuclear receptor important in the transcription of many genes for enzymes of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. It activates GCK transcription. # Upstream stimulatory factor 1 (USF1) is another basic helix- loop-helix zipper (bHLHZ) transactivator. # Hepatic nuclear factor 6 (HNF6) is a homeodomain transcriptional regulator of the \\"one-cut class.\\" HNF6 is also involved in regulation of transcription of gluconeogenic enzymes such as glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. =Hormonal and dietary= Insulin is by far the most important of the hormones that have direct or indirect effects on glucokinase expression and activity in the liver. Insulin appears to affect both glucokinase transcription and activity through multiple direct and indirect pathways. While rising portal vein glucose levels increase glucokinase activity, the concomitant rise of insulin amplifies this effect by induction of glucokinase synthesis. Glucokinase transcription begins to rise within an hour of rising insulin levels. Glucokinase transcription becomes nearly undetectable in prolonged starvation, severe carbohydrate deprivation, or untreated insulin-deficient diabetes. The mechanisms by which insulin induces glucokinase may involve both of the major intracellular pathways of insulin action, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK 1/2) cascade, and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) cascade. The latter may operate via the FOXO1 transactivator. However, as would be expected given its antagonistic effect on glycogen synthesis, glucagon and its intracellular second messenger cAMP suppresses glucokinase transcription and activity, even in the presence of insulin. Other hormones such as triiodothyronine () and glucocorticoids provide permissive or stimulatory effects on glucokinase in certain circumstances. Biotin and retinoic acid increase GCK mRNA transcription as well as GK activity. Fatty acids in significant amounts amplify GK activity in the liver, while long chain acyl CoA inhibits it. =Hepatic= Glucokinase can be rapidly activated and inactivated in hepatocytes by a novel regulatory protein (glucokinase regulatory protein), which operates to maintain an inactive reserve of GK, which can be made quickly available in response to rising levels of portal vein glucose. GKRP moves between nucleus and cytoplasm of the hepatocytes and may be tethered to the microfilament cytoskeleton. It forms reversible 1:1 complexes with GK, and can move it from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. It acts as a competitive inhibitor with glucose, such that the enzyme activity is reduced to near-zero while bound. GK:GKRP complexes are sequestered in the nucleus while glucose and fructose levels are low. Nuclear sequestration may serve to protect GK from degradation by cytoplasmic proteases. GK can be rapidly released from GKRP in response to rising levels of glucose. Unlike GK in beta cells, GK in hepatocytes is not associated with mitochondria. Fructose in tiny (micromolar) amounts (after phosphorylation by ketohexokinase to fructose-1-phosphate (F1P)) accelerates release of GK from GKRP. This sensitivity to the presence of small amounts of fructose allows GKRP, GK, and ketohexokinase to act as a \\"fructose sensing system,\\" which signals that a mixed carbohydrate meal is being digested, and accelerates the utilization of glucose. However, fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) potentiates binding of GK by GKRP. F6P decreases phosphorylation of glucose by GK when glycogenolysis or gluconeogenesis are underway. F1P and F6P both bind to the same site on GKRP. It is postulated that they produce 2 different conformations of GKRP, one able to bind GK and the other not. =Pancreatic= Although most of the glucokinase in the body is in the liver, smaller amounts in the beta and alpha cells of the pancreas, certain hypothalamic neurons, and specific cells (enterocytes) of the gut play an increasingly appreciated role in regulation of carbohydrate metabolism. In the context of glucokinase function, these cell types are collectively referred to as neuroendocrine tissues, and they share some aspects of glucokinase regulation and function, especially the common neuroendocrine promoter. Of the neuroendocrine cells, the beta cells of the pancreatic islets are the most-studied and best-understood. It is likely that many of the regulatory relationships discovered in the beta cells will also exist in the other neuroendocrine tissues with glucokinase. A signal for insulin In islet beta cells, glucokinase activity serves as a principal control for the secretion of insulin in response to rising levels of blood glucose. As G6P is consumed, increasing amounts of ATP initiate a series of processes that result in release of insulin. One of the immediate consequences of increased cellular respiration is a rise in the NADH and NADPH concentrations (collectively referred to as NAD(P)H). This shift in the redox status of the beta cells results in rising intracellular calcium levels, closing of the KATP channels, depolarization of the cell membrane, merging of the insulin secretory granules with the membrane, and release of insulin into the blood. It is as a signal for insulin release that glucokinase exerts the largest effect on blood sugar levels and overall direction of carbohydrate metabolism. Glucose, in turn, influences both the immediate activity and the amount of glucokinase produced in the beta cells. Regulation in beta cells Glucose immediately amplifies glucokinase activity by the cooperativity effect. A second important rapid regulator of glucokinase activity in beta cells occurs by direct protein-protein interaction between glucokinase and the \\"bifunctional enzyme\\" (phosphofructokinase-2/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase), which also plays a role in the regulation of glycolysis. This physical association stabilizes glucokinase in a catalytically favorable conformation (somewhat opposite the effect of GKRP binding) that enhances its activity. In as little as 15 minutes, glucose can stimulate GCK transcription and glucokinase synthesis by way of insulin. Insulin is produced by the beta cells, but some of it acts on beta cell B-type insulin receptors, providing an autocrine positive-feedback amplification of glucokinase activity. Further amplification occurs by insulin action (via A-type receptors) to stimulate its own transcription. Transcription of the GCK gene is initiated through the \\"upstream,\\" or neuroendocrine, promoter. This promoter, in contrast to the liver promoter, has elements homologous to other insulin-induced gene promoters. Among the probable transacting factors are Pdx-1 and PPARŒ≥. Pdx-1 is a homeodomain transcription factor involved in the differentiation of the pancreas. PPARŒ≥ is a nuclear receptor that responds to glitazone drugs by enhancing insulin sensitivity. Association with insulin secretory granules Much, but not all, of the glucokinase found in the cytoplasm of beta cells is associated with insulin secretory granules and with mitochondria. The proportion thus \\"bound\\" falls rapidly in response to rising glucose and insulin secretion. It has been suggested that binding serves a purpose similar to the hepatic glucokinase regulatory protein‚Äîprotecting glucokinase from degradation so that it is rapidly available as the glucose rises. The effect is to amplify the glucokinase response to glucose more rapidly than transcription could do so. Suppression of glucagon in alpha cells It has also been proposed that glucokinase plays a role in the glucose sensing of the pancreatic alpha cells, but the evidence is less consistent, and some researchers have found no evidence of glucokinase activity in these cells. Alpha cells occur in pancreatic islets, mixed with beta and other cells. While beta cells respond to rising glucose levels by secreting insulin, alpha cells respond by reducing glucagon secretion. When blood glucose concentration falls to hypoglycemic levels, alpha cells release glucagon. Glucagon is a protein hormone that blocks the effect of insulin on hepatocytes, inducing glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, and reduced glucokinase activity in hepatocytes. The degree to which glucose suppression of glucagon is a direct effect of glucose via glucokinase in alpha cells, or an indirect effect mediated by insulin or other signals from beta cells, is still uncertain. =Hypothalamic= While all neurons use glucose for fuel, certain glucose-sensing neurons alter their firing rates in response to rising or falling levels of glucose. These glucose-sensing neurons are concentrated primarily in the ventromedial nucleus and arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, which regulate many aspects of glucose homeostasis (especially the response to hypoglycemia), fuel utilization, satiety and appetite, and weight maintenance. These neurons are most sensitive to glucose changes in the 0.5‚Äì3.5 mmol/L glucose range. Glucokinase has been found in the brain in largely the same areas that contain glucose-sensing neurons, including both of the hypothalamic nuclei. Inhibition of glucokinase abolishes the ventromedial nucleus response to a meal. However, brain glucose levels are lower than plasma levels, typically 0.5‚Äì3.5 mmol/L. Although this range is matches the sensitivity of the glucose-sensing neurons, it is below the optimal inflection sensitivity for glucokinase. The presumption, based on indirect evidence and speculation, is that neuronal glucokinase is somehow exposed to plasma glucose levels even in the neurons. =Enterocytes and incretin= While glucokinase has been shown to occur in certain cells (enterocytes) of the small intestine and stomach, its function and regulation have not been worked out. It has been suggested that here, also, glucokinase serves as a glucose sensor, allowing these cells to provide one of the earliest metabolic responses to incoming carbohydrates. It is suspected that these cells are involved in incretin functions. Clinical significance Because insulin is one of, if not the most important, regulators of glucokinase synthesis, diabetes mellitus of all types diminishes glucokinase synthesis and activity by a variety of mechanisms. Glucokinase activity is sensitive to oxidative stress of cells, especially the beta cells. Around 200 mutations of the human glucokinase gene GCK have been discovered, that can change the efficiency of glucose binding and phosphorylation, increasing or decreasing the sensitivity of beta cell insulin secretion in response to glucose, and producing clinically significant hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. =Diabetes mellitus= GCK mutations reduce the functional efficiency of the glucokinase molecule. Heterozygosity for alleles with reduced enzyme activity results in a higher threshold for insulin release and persistent, mild hyperglycemia. This condition is referred to as maturity onset diabetes of the young, type 2 (MODY2). The most recent overview of GCK mutation that were observed in patients claims 791 mutations, of which 489 are thought to cause the MODY diabetes and therefore reduce the functional efficiency of the glucokinase molecule. Homozygosity for GCK alleles with reduced function can cause severe congenital insulin deficiency, resulting in persistent neonatal diabetes. =Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia= Some mutations have been found to enhance insulin secretion. Heterozygosity for gain of function mutations reduces the threshold glucose that triggers insulin release. This creates hypoglycemia of varying patterns, including transient or persistent congenital hyperinsulinism, or fasting or reactive hypoglycemia appearing at an older age. The most recent overview of GCK mutation that were observed in patients claimed 17 GCK mutations to cause hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. Homozygosity for gain of function mutations has not been found. Research Several pharmaceutical companies are researching molecules that activate glucokinase in hope that it will be useful in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

Adjacent to the northern boundary of Greater London, it is part of the metropolitan area of London and the Greater London Built-up Area. It is on the Central line of the London Underground. History =Toponymy= According to P. H. Reaney's Place-Names of Essex the name means 'Cicca's well', Cicca being an Anglo-Saxon personal name. In medieval sources the name appears with a variety of spellings including \\"Cinghe uuella\\" and Chikewelle\\".Plea Rolls of the Court of Common Pleas. National Archives. CP 40/629; http://aalt.law.uh.edu/H5/CP40no629/bCP40no629dorses/IMG_1346.htm; 5th entry; some of the defendants live in 'Chikewell' Folk etymology has sought to derive the name from a lost \\"king's well\\", supposed to have been to the south- east of the parish near the border of what is now the London Borough of Redbridge. There were several medicinal springs in Chigwell Row documented by Miller Christy in his book History of the mineral waters and medicinal springs of the county of Essex, published in 1910. The 18th-century historian Nathaniel Salmon stated that the \\"-well\\" element in the name derives from Anglo-Saxon weald (wood). The land registration map of Redbridge Council shows \\"Chig Well (site of)\\" as being located to the rear of the house located at 67 Brocket Way, Chigwell. =Economic development= Traditionally a rural farming community, but now largely suburban, Chigwell was mentioned in the Domesday Book. It referred to by Charles Dickens in his novel Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of 'Eighty; the Maypole Inn is based on the King's Head inn, though the name was taken from the Maypole public house in Chigwell Row; and it is likely Dickens visited both hostelries. Dickens frequently visited Chigwell, which he described in a letter to John Forster as \\"the greatest place in the world ... Such a delicious old inn opposite the churchyard ... such beautiful forest scenery ... such an out of the way rural place...\\". =Local government= The Chigwell civil parish was part of Epping Rural District from 1894 to 1933, with local government split between Chigwell Parish Council, Epping Rural District Council and Essex County Council. Following a county review order in 1933, Chigwell formed together with Buckhurst Hill and Loughton the Chigwell Urban District, with the Chigwell Urban District Council replacing both the parish and rural district councils. When Greater London was created in 1965 a small, more densely populated section to the southeast was transferred to the London Borough of Redbridge; this area is now known as the Manford estate and continues to be within the Chigwell post town. The rest of Chigwell Urban District was incorporated into the Epping Forest District in 1974. Parish councils were re-established for Chigwell and Loughton, and for the first time in Buckhurst Hill, in 1996. =RAF Chigwell= From 1933 to 1958 there was an RAF presenceRoding Valley Meadows ‚Äì RAF Chigwell Epping Forest District Council at Roding Valley Meadows (near what is now the David Lloyd Leisure Centre). It served first to provide barrage balloon protection during the Second World War and was involved in the rollout of Britain's coastal nuclear early warning system during the Cold War. In 1953 it briefly housed the RAF contingent taking part in the Coronation celebrations. Some of the RAF Chigwell site is now part of the Local Nature Reserve, Roding Valley Meadows LNR. Governance The local council of the civil parish is Chigwell Parish Council. The parish council originally existed from 1894 to 1933, and was created again in 1996. The parish council offices are located on Hainault Road. Councillors are elected from three wards: Grange Hill, Chigwell Row and Chigwell Village. Local councillors are also elected to Epping Forest District Council and Essex County Council. Geography St Mary's Church, Chigwell The hamlet of Chigwell Row lies towards the east of Chigwell, near Lambourne; this part of the parish is well forested and mostly rural. Grange Hill is the area around the junction of Manor Road and Fencepiece Road/Hainault Road, extending as far as the boundary with Redbridge including the Limes Farm estate. Chigwell has a population of around 12,500 and is generally considered a wealthy area, which since the TV series Essex Wives, journalists have called (with Loughton and Buckhurst Hill), the Essex golden triangle. The area is characterised by large suburban houses, notably in Manor Road, Hainault Road and Chigwell High Road, which featured in the popular English situation comedy Birds of a Feather (although many of the outside locations used in that programme were not in Chigwell). Education Chigwell School c. 1904 Schools in the area include Chigwell Primary Academy, Limes Farm Infants School & Nursery, Limes Farm Junior School, Guru Gobind Singh Khalsa College, West Hatch High School and Chigwell School, an independent school, which was founded from a bequest by Samuel Harsnett, Archbishop of York, in 1629, among whose past pupils are William Penn, who later went on to found Pennsylvania, and actor Sir Ian Holm. (Registration required). The diarist John Aubrey recorded that it was at Chigwell School that Penn had a mystical vision, which influenced his later conversion to Quakerism. The original 17th-century schoolroom where Penn was taught still stands, and is now the school library. Culture Ye Olde King's Head and St Mary's Church, depicted in 1851 Until May 2012 Tottenham Hotspur Football Club had its training facilities in the area, when they moved to a new facility in Enfield, north east London, However the club still runs training sessions for local youth on the Limes Farm estate through the summer months. Many past and present players and staff have homes in the area. Leyton Orient Football Club also have a training ground in Chigwell, adjacent to Chigwell School's fields. A David Lloyd Leisure Centre is situated off Roding Road by the M11 motorway, which contains indoor and outdoor tennis courts, swimming pools and gymnasium. Also in the area are a Holmes Place Health Club, Topgolf playing Centre and Chigwell Golf Club. Chigwell Cricket Club is based at the Old Chigwellians Club in Roding Lane. Chigwell also plays host to the Old Loughtonians Hockey Club. The town is also included in a number of London loop walks, which start in the city and pass through the outskirts of the capital. There are two pubs, The King William IV and the Two Brewers. Ye Olde King's Head, which was operated as a pub until 2011 is said to be the Maypole Inn in Dickens' Barnaby Rudge. The building was subsequently sold to local resident Lord Sugar's property company Amsprop which now leases the Grade 1 building to the Sheesh Turkish restaurant. Until their closure in 2002, Chigwell had night clubs, known collectively as the Epping Forest Country Club. There is a Local Nature Reserve at Roding Valley Meadows off Roding Lane which follows the River Roding up to Loughton. The TV series Birds of a Feather is set in Chigwell. Transport Chigwell Station, opened 1903 by the Great Eastern Railway All bus services are Transport for London services, except the 804. Routes 150 just penetrates into Chigwell Row. Routes 362 and 462 serve only Grange Hill. Chigwell is served by Chigwell station and Grange Hill station (further south bordering Hainault), both on the Central line of the London Underground. For a more frequent service to London there are also nearby Buckhurst Hill, Woodford, Loughton and Hainault stations as services between Grange Hill and Woodford are limited to three trains per hour in each direction, with an increased service during morning peak hours.

As Gen. Robert E. Lee's Confederate army invaded Maryland, a portion of his army under Maj. Gen. Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson surrounded, bombarded, and captured the Union garrison at Harpers Ferry, Virginia (now West Virginia). As Lee's Army of Northern Virginia advanced down the Shenandoah Valley into Maryland, he planned to capture the garrison at Harpers Ferry to secure his line of supply back to Virginia. Although he was being pursued at a leisurely pace by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan's Army of the Potomac, outnumbering him more than two to one, Lee chose the risky strategy of dividing his army and sent one portion to converge and attack Harpers Ferry from three directions. Col. Dixon S. Miles, Union commander at Harpers Ferry, insisted on keeping most of the troops near the town instead of taking up commanding positions on the surrounding heights. The slim defenses of the most important position, Maryland Heights, first encountered the approaching Confederates on September 12, but only brief skirmishing ensued. Strong attacks by two Confederate brigades on September 13 drove the Union troops from the heights. During the fighting on Maryland Heights, the other Confederate columns arrived and were astonished to see that critical positions to the west and south of town were not defended. Jackson methodically positioned his artillery around Harpers Ferry and ordered Maj. Gen. A.P. Hill to move down the west bank of the Shenandoah River in preparation for a flank attack on the Federal left the next morning. By the morning of September 15, Jackson had positioned nearly 50 guns on Maryland Heights and at the base of Loudoun Heights. He began a fierce artillery barrage from all sides and ordered an infantry assault. Miles realized that the situation was hopeless and agreed with his subordinates to raise the white flag of surrender. Before he could surrender personally, he was mortally wounded by an artillery shell and died the next day. After processing more than 12,000 Union prisoners, Jackson's men then rushed to Sharpsburg, Maryland, to rejoin Lee for the Battle of Antietam. Background thumbrightupright=1.5Maryland Campaign, actions September 3-15, 1862 Harpers Ferry is a small town at the confluence of the Potomac River and the Shenandoah River, the site of a historic Federal arsenal founded by President George Washington in 1799 Wolff, p. 928. and a bridge for the critical Baltimore and Ohio Railroad across the Potomac. In 1859 it was the site of the abolitionist John Brown's attack on the Federal arsenal. The town was virtually indefensible, dominated on all sides by higher ground. To the west, the ground rose gradually for about a mile and a half to Bolivar Heights, a plateau high, that stretches from the Potomac to the Shenandoah. To the south, across the Shenandoah, Loudoun Heights overlooks from . And to the northeast, across the Potomac, the southernmost extremity of Elk Ridge forms the 1,476-foot-high crest of Maryland Heights. A Federal soldier wrote that if these three heights could not be held, Harpers Ferry would be \\"no more defensible than a well bottom.\\"Bailey, p. 39. As Gen. Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia advanced into Maryland, Lee expected that the Union garrisons that potentially blocked his supply line in the Shenandoah Valley, at Winchester, Martinsburg, and Harpers Ferry, would be cut off and abandoned without firing a shot (and, in fact, both Winchester and Martinsburg were evacuated).Sears, p. 83. But the Harpers Ferry garrison had not retreated. Lee planned to capture the garrison and the arsenal, not only to seize its supplies of rifles and ammunition, but to secure his line of supply back to Virginia. Although he was being pursued at a leisurely pace by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan and the Union Army of the Potomac, which outnumbered him by more than two to one, Lee chose the risky strategy of dividing his army to seize the prize of Harpers Ferry. While the corps of Maj. Gen. James Longstreet drove north in the direction of Hagerstown, Lee sent columns of troops to converge and attack Harpers Ferry from three directions. The largest column, 11,500 men under Jackson, was to recross the Potomac and circle around to the west of Harpers Ferry and attack it from Bolivar Heights, while the other two columns, under Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws (8,000 men) and Brig. Gen. John G. Walker (3,400), were to capture Maryland Heights and Loudoun Heights, commanding the town from the east and south.Bailey, pp. 38‚Äì39. McClellan had wanted to add the Harpers Ferry garrison to his field army, but general-in- chief Henry W. Halleck had refused, saying that the movement would be too difficult and that the garrison had to defend itself \\"until the latest moment,\\" or until McClellan could relieve it. Halleck had probably expected its commander, Col. Dixon S. Miles, to show some military knowledge and courage. Miles was a 38-year veteran of the U.S. Army and the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, but who had been disgraced after the First Battle of Bull Run when a court of inquiry held that he had been drunk during the battle. Miles swore off liquor and was sent to the supposedly quiet post at Harpers Ferry.Sears, p. 89. His garrison comprised 14,000 men, many inexperienced, including 2,500 who had been forced out of Martinsburg by the approach of Jackson's men on September 11. On the night of September 11, McLaws arrived at Brownsville, 6 miles northeast of Harpers Ferry. He left 3,000 men near Brownsville Gap to protect his rear and moved 3,000 others toward the Potomac River to seal off any eastern escape route from Harpers Ferry. He dispatched the veteran brigades of Brig. Gens. Joseph B. Kershaw and William Barksdale to seize Maryland Heights on September 12. The other Confederate columns were making slow progress and were behind schedule. Jackson's men were delayed at Martinsburg. Walker's men were ordered to destroy the aqueduct carrying the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal across the Monocacy River where it empties into the Potomac, but his engineers had difficulty demolishing the stone structure and the attempt was eventually abandoned.Sears, p. 95. Walker reentered Virginia, in Loudoun County on September 9, across from Point of Rocks. Walker was escorted by Col. E.V. White, Loudoun native, and his 35th Battalion of Virginia Cavalry. White was unhappy with the assignment and preferred to be with the rest of the army. Unfortunately White had gotten into an altercation with Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart in Frederick and was subsequently ordered back to Virginia by Lee. Whether or not his disposition was to blame, White led Walker on a meandering route around the Short Hill Mountain to reach the base of Loudoun Heights four days later on September 13.Divine, np. So the attack on Harpers Ferry that had been planned for September 11 was delayed, increasing the risk that McClellan might engage and destroy a portion of Lee's army while it was divided. Battle =September 12= William MacLeod, Maryland Heights - Siege of Harpers Ferry, 1863 Battle of Harpers Ferry Miles insisted on keeping most of the troops near the town instead of taking up commanding positions on the surrounding heights. He apparently was interpreting literally his orders to hold the town. The defenses of the most important position, Maryland Heights, were designed to fight off raiders, but not to hold the heights themselves. There was a powerful artillery battery halfway up the heights: two naval Dahlgren rifles, one 50-pounder Parrott rifle, and four 12-pounder smoothbores. On the crest, Miles assigned Col. Thomas H. Ford of the 32nd Ohio Infantry to command parts of four regiments, 1,600 men. Some of these men, including those of the 126th New York, had been in the Army only 21 days and lacked basic combat skills. They erected primitive breastworks and sent skirmishers a quarter-mile in the direction of the Confederates.Sears, pp. 122-23. On September 12 they encountered the approaching men from Kershaw's South Carolina brigade, who had been moving slowly through the very difficult terrain on Elk Ridge. Rifle volleys from behind abatis caused the Confederates to stop for the night. =September 13= Kershaw began his attack at about 6:30 a.m., September 13. He planned to push his own brigade directly against the Union breastworks while Barksdale's Mississippians flanked the Federal right. Kershaw's men charged into the abatis twice and were driven back with heavy losses. The inexperienced New York troops were holding their own. Their commander, Col. Ford, felt ill that morning and stayed back two miles (3 km) behind the lines, leaving the fighting to Col. Eliakim Sherrill, the second-ranking officer. Sherrill was wounded by a bullet through the cheek and tongue while rallying his men and had to be carried from the field, making the green troops grow panicky. As Barksdale's Mississippians approached on the flank, the New Yorkers broke and fled rearward. Although Maj. Sylvester Hewitt ordered the remaining units to reform farther along the ridge, orders came at 3:30 p.m. from Col. Ford to retreat. (In doing so, he apparently neglected to send for the 900 men of the 115th New York, waiting in reserve midway up the slope.) His men destroyed their artillery pieces and crossed a pontoon bridge back to Harpers Ferry. Ford later insisted he had the authority from Miles to order the withdrawal, but a court of inquiry concluded that he had \\"abandoned his position without sufficient cause,\\" and recommended his dismissal from the Army.Bailey, p. 43. During the fighting on Maryland Heights, the other Confederate columns arrived--Walker to the base of Loudoun Heights at 10 a.m. and Jackson's three divisions (Brig. Gen. John R. Jones to the north, Brig. Gen. Alexander R. Lawton in the center, and Maj. Gen. A.P. Hill to the south) to the west of Bolivar Heights at 11 a.m.--and were astonished to see that these positions were not defended. Inside the town, the Union officers realized they were surrounded and pleaded with Miles to attempt to recapture Maryland Heights, but he refused, insisting that his forces on Bolivar Heights would defend the town from the west. He exclaimed, \\"I am ordered to hold this place and God damn my soul to hell if I don't.\\" In fact, Jackson's and Miles's forces to the west of town were roughly equal, but Miles was ignoring the threat from the artillery massing to his northeast and south. Late that night, Miles sent Capt. Charles Russell of the 1st Maryland Cavalry with nine troopers to slip through the enemy lines and take a message to McClellan, or any other general he could find, informing them that the besieged town could hold out only for 48 hours. Otherwise, he would be forced to surrender. Russell's men slipped across South Mountain and reached McClellan's headquarters at Frederick. The general was surprised and dismayed to receive the news. He wrote a message to Miles that a relief force was on the way and told him, \\"Hold out to the last extremity. If it is possible, re- occupy the Maryland Heights with your whole force.\\" McClellan ordered Maj. Gen. William B. Franklin and his VI Corps to march from Crampton's Gap to relieve Miles. Although three couriers were sent with this information on different routes, none of them reached Harpers Ferry in time.Sears, p. 133.Wolff, p. 930. =September 14= Union military positions near Harpers Ferry in both 1862 and 1864. Restored Civil War period map. While battles raged at the passes on South Mountain, Jackson had methodically positioned his artillery around Harpers Ferry. This included four Parrott rifles to the summit of Maryland Heights, a task that required 200 men wrestling the ropes of each gun. Although Jackson wanted all of his guns to open fire simultaneously, Walker on Loudoun Heights grew impatient and began an ineffectual bombardment with five guns shortly after 1 p.m. Jackson ordered A.P. Hill to move down the west bank of the Shenandoah in preparation for a flank attack on the Federal left the next morning.Bailey, p. 56. That night, the Union officers realized they had less than 24 hours left, but they made no attempt to recapture Maryland Heights. Unbeknownst to Miles, only a single Confederate regiment now occupied the crest, after McLaws had withdrawn the remainder to meet the Union assault at Crampton's Gap. Col. Benjamin F. \\"Grimes\\" Davis proposed to Miles that his troopers of the 12th Illinois Cavalry, the Loudoun Rangers, and some smaller units from Maryland and Rhode Island, attempt to break out. Cavalry forces were essentially useless in the defense of the town. Miles dismissed the idea as \\"wild and impractical,\\" but Davis was adamant and Miles relented when he saw that the fiery Mississippian intended to break out, with or without permission. Davis and Col. Arno Voss led their 1,400 cavalrymen out of Harpers Ferry on a pontoon bridge across the Potomac, turning left onto a narrow road that wound to the west around the base of Maryland Heights in the north toward Sharpsburg. Despite a number of close calls with returning Confederates from South Mountain, the cavalry column encountered a wagon train approaching from Hagerstown with James Longstreet's reserve supply of ammunition. They were able to trick the wagoneers into following them in another direction and they repulsed the Confederate cavalry escort in the rear of the column, and the southern teamsters found themselves surrounded by Federals in the morning. Capturing more than 40 enemy ordnance wagons, Davis had lost not a single man in combat, the first great cavalry exploit of the war for the Army of the Potomac.Sears, pp. 151-52; Bailey, pp. 57-58. =September 15= By the morning of September 15, Jackson had positioned nearly 50 guns on Maryland Heights and at the base of Loudoun Heights, prepared to enfilade the rear of the Federal line on Bolivar Heights. Jackson began a fierce artillery barrage from all sides and ordered an infantry assault for 8 a.m. Miles realized that the situation was hopeless. He had no expectation that relief would arrive from McClellan in time and his artillery ammunition was in short supply. At a council of war with his brigade commanders, he agreed to raise the white flag of surrender. But he would not be personally present at any ceremony. He was confronted by a captain of the 126th New York Infantry, who said, \\"For ----'s sake, Colonel, don't surrender us. Don't you hear the signal guns? Our forces are near us. Let us cut our way out and join them.\\" But Miles replied, \\"Impossible. They will blow us out of this place in half an hour.\\" As the captain turned away in disdain, a shell exploded, shattering Miles's left leg. So disgusted were the men of the garrison with Miles's behavior, which some claimed involved being drunk again, it was difficult to find a man who would take him to the hospital. He was mortally wounded and died the next day. Some historians have speculated that Miles was struck deliberately by fire from his own men.Eicher, p. 347. Aftermath Jackson had won a great victory at minor expense. The Confederate Army sustained 286 casualties (39 killed, 247 wounded), mostly from the fighting on Maryland Heights, while the Union Army sustained 12,636 (44 killed, 173 wounded, 12,419 captured).NPS. The Union garrison also surrendered 13,000 small arms, 200 wagons, and 73 artillery pieces.Bailey, p. 59. It was the largest surrender of Federal forces during the Civil War.Robertson, p. 606. The list of captured artillery pieces included one 50-pounder Parrott rifle (spiked), six M1841 24-pounder howitzers, four 20-pounder Parrott rifles, eight M1841 12-pounder field guns (2 spiked), four 12-pounder Napoleons (2 spiked), six M1841 6-pounder field guns, two 10-pounder Dahlgren guns (spiked), 10 3-inch Ordnance rifles, and six 3-inch James rifles. Confederate soldiers feasted on Union food supplies and helped themselves to fresh blue Federal uniforms, which would cause some confusion in the coming days. About the only unhappy men in Jackson's force were the cavalrymen, who had hoped to replenish their exhausted mounts.Sears, pp. 153-54. Jackson sent off a courier to Lee with the news. \\"Through God's blessing, Harper's Ferry and its garrison are to be surrendered.\\" As he rode into town to supervise his men, Union prisoners lined the roadside, eager for a look at the famous Stonewall. One of them observed Jackson's dirty, seedy uniform and remarked, \\"Boys, he isn't much for looks, but if we'd had him we wouldn't have been caught in this trap.\\"Sears, p. 154. By early afternoon, Jackson received an urgent message from General Lee, telling him to get his troops to Sharpsburg as quickly as possible. Jackson left A.P. Hill at Harpers Ferry to manage the parole of Federal prisoners and began marching to join the Battle of Antietam.

He served as the 45th mayor of Cleveland, Ohio, as a U.S. Senator from Ohio, and as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Born in Boston, Burton practiced law in Cleveland after graduating from Harvard Law School. After serving in the United States Army during World War I, Burton became active in Republican Party politics and won election to the Ohio House of Representatives. After serving as the mayor of Cleveland, Burton won election to the United States Senate in 1940. After the retirement of Associate Justice Owen J. Roberts, President Harry S. Truman successfully nominated Burton to the Supreme Court. Burton served on the Court until 1958, when he was succeeded by Potter Stewart. Burton was known as a dispassionate, pragmatic, somewhat plodding jurist who preferred to rule on technical and procedural rather than constitutional grounds. He was also seen as an affable justice who helped ease tension on the court during an extremely acrimonious time. He wrote the majority opinion in Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath (1951) and Lorain Journal Co. v. United States (1951). He also helped shape the Court's unanimous decision in Brown v. Board of Education (1954). Early life Harold was born in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, the second son of Anna Gertrude (Hitz) and Alfred E. Burton. His younger brother was named Felix Arnold Burton. Harold's father was an engineer and the first Dean of Student Affairs at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1902-1921), reporting to the president. He taught at MIT before being selected as dean. As a former explorer, Burton had accompanied Robert Peary on several expeditions to the North Pole. Barbara Elleman, Virginia Lee Burton: A Life in Art, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2002, pp. 7-9 Harold's mother died young. In 1906, his father married Lena Yates, a poet and artist from England.\\"Virginia Lee Burton\\", Gloucester Lyceum & Sawyer Free Library (She later took the name of Jeanne D'Orge.) They met that year on a walking trip in France. Yates published children's books as Lena Dalkeith. The couple had three children: Christine, Virginia (1909-1968), and Alexander Ross Burton. The half siblings developed warm relationships over time. Virginia became an author and illustrator. Burton attended Bowdoin College, where he was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa honor society,Supreme Court Justices Who Are Phi Beta Kappa Members , Phi Beta Kappa website, accessed Oct 4, 2009 was quarterback of the football team, and graduated summa cum laude.HAROLD HITZ BURTON: MAYOR, SENATOR, & SUPREME COURT JUSTICE , accessed March 2, 2011. His roommate and Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Theta chapter) brother was Owen Brewster, later a U.S. Senator from Maine. Burton went on to Harvard Law School, graduating in 1912. Felix Arnold Buton became an architect after also attending Bowdoin. The Burton brothers and J. Edgar Hoover were second cousins on their mothers' side. Their common great-grandparents were Johannes (Hans) Hitz, first Swiss Consul General to the United States, and his wife Anna Kohler. Marriage and family Burton married Selma Florence Smith in 1912. They had four children: Barbara (Mrs. Charles Weidner), William (who served on the USS Samuel B. Roberts (DE-413) during WWII, in the Ohio House of Representatives and was a noted trial lawyer), Deborah (Mrs. Wallace Adler), and Robert (a distinguished attorney and counsel to athletes). Early career After graduation and marriage, Burton moved with his wife to Cleveland and began the practice of law there. However, in 1914, he joined his wife's uncle as a company attorney for Utah Power and Light Company in Salt Lake City. He later worked for Utah Light and Traction, and then for Idaho Power Company and Boise Valley Traction Company, both in Boise, Idaho.Harold Hitz Burton biography at the Ohio Judicial Center, accessed March 2, 2011 When the U.S. entered World War I, Burton joined the United States Army, rising to the rank of Captain. He served as an infantry officer, saw heavy action in France and Belgium, and received the Belgian Croix de guerre. After the war, Burton joined several veterans' organizations, including the Army and Navy Union, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the American Legion. After the war, Burton returned with his family to Cleveland, where he resumed his law practice. He also taught at Western Reserve University Law School. Politics Burton testifying before a Senate committee in 1938 In the late 1920s, Burton entered politics as a Republican. He was elected to the East Cleveland Board of Education in 1927 and to the Ohio House of Representatives in 1928. After serving briefly in the Ohio House, he became law director for the City of Cleveland in 1929 before returning to private practice in 1932. In 1935, Burton was elected mayor of Cleveland. He worked on issues of continuing assimilation of immigrant populations, supporting industry in the city, and dealing with transportation needs. Re-elected twice, he served until entering the U.S. Senate in 1941. For his decorous personal life and opposition to organized crime, he was dubbed \\"the Boy Scout Mayor.\\" In 1940, Burton was popularly elected to the U.S. Senate, with 52.3% of the vote, defeating John McSweeney.Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives, Statistics of the Presidential and Congressional Election of November 5, 1940, p. 24 It was in the Senate that he first met fellow Senator Harry S. Truman. Burton served on the Senate Special Committee to Investigate the National Defense Program (Truman Committee), which monitored the U.S. war effort during World War II, and the two got along well. Truman was elected Vice President in 1944 and succeeded as President upon the death of Franklin Roosevelt in 1945. Supreme Court =Nomination= Justice Owen J. Roberts announced his resignation from the Supreme Court on June 30, 1945, effective July 31, 1945. Truman decided, as a bipartisan gesture, to appoint a Republican to replace him. He selected Burton as someone whom he knew and respected. Truman announced Burton's nomination on September 19. The nomination was forwarded to the Senate on September 20. The Senate referred it to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which referred it unanimously back to the Senate for confirmation without holding any hearings. Hours later, the Senate unanimously approved the nomination. It took less than a day. Burton resigned from the Senate on September 30, 1945, and was sworn in as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court on October 1. Burton was the last sitting member of Congress to be appointed to the Court. (Sherman Minton, a former senator, was appointed in 1949.) =Judicial philosophy and working style= According to biographer Eric W. Rise, Burton appeared to lack an overarching judicial philosophy. He favored judicial restraint and most of his decisions were based on narrow procedural grounds rather than the Constitution. His judicial restraint, however, was informed by his political views, not by a legal philosophy, and he tended to defer to legislative and executive branch judgments because he agreed with them personally. This pragmatism won him the respect of his fellow justices, and served as a unifying influence on the court when the other justices were split on constitutional issues but could come together on technical or procedural grounds. From 1945 to 1953, Burton was usually in the centrist majority on the court, sometimes finding himself in a slightly more conservative majority on some issues. He was part of the \\"Vinson bloc\\", which included Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson and Associate Justices Tom C. Clark, Sherman Minton, and Stanley Forman Reed. These five voted together 75 percent of the time in non-unanimous decisions. But beginning with the appointment of Earl Warren as Chief Justice in 1953, and more so after the appointment of William J. Brennan Jr. in 1956, Burton found himself increasingly in the minority. Burton biographer Mary Frances Berry has written that Burton knew \\"he was not brilliant and that writing came hard\\", and therefore not only worked very hard on his decisions but attempted to show this work by outlining all the precedents he had considered before reaching a conclusion. Burton insisted on having all precedents researched before writing his opinions, wrote the first draft of his opinions himself, and was well known for working long hours in his office. His hard work earned him respect and praise from his colleagues, but his working style also limited his judicial output. Outside the court, the press and some prominent legal scholars depicted Burton as mediocre, plodding, a weak legal mind, and more concerned with social activities. Burton was also very well-liked by all his colleagues, and his easy-going nature helped to ease tensions on the court. =Cold War, loyalty oath, and subversion rulings= The Cold War led state and federal governments to enact a wide variety of laws and regulations aimed at curbing espionage and subversion. Burton consistently showed deference to government restrictions on free speech, voting to uphold government action 27 out of 28 times. He also wrote several important decisions. His basic approach toward these questions was judicial deference, as exemplified in his strong dissent in Duncan v. Kahanamoku, 327 U.S. 304 (1946). His first important majority opinion came in Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath, 341 U.S. 123 (1951), where a group had challenged the authority of the U.S. Attorney General to unilaterally declare groups to be Communist. Despite a significant split among the justices, Burton wrote a plurality decision in which he disposed of the case on technical grounds. He argued that the listing was technically legal. But in a court of law, the Attorney General had to offer evidence of subversion, which he had not. Burton also joined the majority in three important Fifth Amendment cases. In Emspak v. United States, 349 U.S. 190 (1955), he voted with the majority to extend the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination to testimony before congressional committees. He also joined the majority in Ullmann v. United States, 350 U.S. 422 (1956), an important decision which upheld the Immunity Act of 1954 (which stripped the right against self-incrimination from persons given immunity from federal prosecution). Burton's narrow procedural approach proved important in Beilan v. Board of Education, 357 U.S. 399 (1958). Two years earlier, six justices had formed a majority in Slochower v. Board of Higher Education of New York City, 350 U.S. 551 (1956), holding it unconstitutional for a school board to fire an employee for exercising their Fifth Amendment rights against self- incrimination. In Beilan, a teacher was dismissed not for exercising Fifth Amendment rights but for refusing to answer a question at all. Despite the retirement of Sherman Minton (who had joined his dissent in Slochower), Burton's narrow procedural approach in Beilan won over Justices Felix Frankfurter and John Marshall Harlan II and (with the support of new Justice Charles Evans Whittaker), Burton was able form a majority upholding the school district's action. At times, Burton's pragmatism could lead to important legislative outcomes. He joined the 7-to-1 majority in Jencks v. United States, 353 U.S. 657 (1957), in which the court reversed the conviction of a labor leader under federal loyalty laws because the defendant was not given permission to view the evidence against him. Burton agreed with the majority, although he added the caveat that such evidence should first be reviewed by a district court judge to ensure that no national security secrets were revealed. Burton's view was subsequently adopted by Congress with passage of the Jencks Act in 1958. In one of his last opinions in the area, Burton voted to limit the application Smith Act in Yates v. United States, 354 U.S. 298 (1957). The majority had overturned the conviction of seven individuals using the \\"clear and present danger\\" First Amendment doctrine by concluding they had advocated violent overthrow of the government as an abstract doctrine, not as advocacy to action. Burton wrote an opinion concurring in the outcome, but cast his vote on narrow procedural grounds. =Church and state= Generally, Burton favored a strict separation of church and state. But his pragmatic approach to law sometimes caused him to dissent from majorities favoring a strict separation. For example, in Everson v. Board of Education, 330 U.S. 1 (1947), Justice Hugo Black ruled, 5-to-4, that while the Constitution required a strict separation between church and state, it was constitutionally permissible for a school district to reimburse parents when their children rode public school buses to religious schools so long as all such parents and religions were treated equally. Burton initially was predisposed to declare the law constitutional. Heavy lobbying from justices Felix Frankfurter, Robert H. Jackson, and Wiley Blount Rutledge changed his mind. Burton dissented in the case not because he disagreed with Black's emphasis on the strict separation between church and state but because he believed that the state law violated the strict separation doctrine laid out by Black. The following year, Burton joined Black in the majority in McCollum v. Board of Education, 333 U.S. 203 (1948). At issue was a state law which gave students \\"release time\\" to attend religious instruction on school grounds during the school day. The majority struck down the law as a violation of the First Amendment. Burton joined the majority only after Black agreed not to extend his ruling to release time programs that involved off-site religious instruction. Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306 (1952), was factually similar to McCollum, although there was no instruction on school grounds. Although Burton's law clerks argued that the school was tacitly instructing children to attend religious classes, Burton disagreed, characterizing the dismissal as akin to excusing a child from school for a doctor's appointment. Burton joined the 6-to-3 majority. =Criminal procedure= Burton was deferential to the state on criminal procedure and law-and-order issues. Beginning with Betts v. Brady, 316 U.S. 455 (1942), the Supreme Court had ruled in a wide range of cases that except in cases of illiteracy, mental incapacity, or especially complicated cases, defendants did not have an absolute right to be informed of their right to counsel or to have counsel appointed for them by the state. The Court had opportunity to revisit Betts in Bute v. Illinois, 333 U.S. 640 (1948), where a felon appealed his conviction because the trial court had not advised him of his right to counsel and because the plaintiff felt he had been rushed to trial, claims he felt violated constitutional guarantees to a fair trial and due process of law. Burton wrote for a 5-to-4 majority that the Constitution did not require a state to advise a defendant about his rights to counsel, or to provide such counsel, if the crime is not a capital offense. Applying the 14th Amendment to the states in this area \\"would disregard the basic and historic power of the states to prescribe their own local court procedures,\\" Burton wrote. Yet, Bute was notable for carving out a capital-case exemption to Betts. Much criticized at the time for being inconsistent with Betts, the Bute decision unintentionally established grounds for the Supreme Court to whittle away at Betts, so that by 1962 some legal scholars were already arguing the Court had effectively overruled Betts. Betts and Bute were unanimously overruled Court in Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963). Another case decided the same year as Bute illustrates Burton's reliance on personal views as a guide to court action. Gilbert Thiel suffered a mental breakdown and leapt from a moving Southern Pacific Railroad passenger car, severely injuring himself. Thiel argued that railway personnel should have stopped him. The trial court blocked hourly-wage workers from being selected for the jury, which Thiel alleged biased the jury against him. Burton was powerfully motivated by a need to protect the Supreme Court's reputation, which he felt would be sullied if it approved such a distasteful practice. The majority in Thiel v. Southern Pacific Co., 328 U.S. 217 (1946), narrowed its opinion to address only the facts regarding jury selection, and therefore did not decide whether the jury actually was biased against Thiel. This helped to win Burton's approval as well. Burton's belief that criminal procedure should be left to the states influenced his views in other cases as well. In Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12 (1956), a majority held that an indigent criminal defendant could not be denied transcripts of the trial. Burton wrote a dissent, joined by justices Minton, Harlan, and Reed, in which he strongly defended the federal nature of criminal procedure. Burton also wrote a stinging dissent in Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U.S. 459 (1947). The state of Louisiana attempted to execute convicted murderer Willie Francis on May 3, 1946. But the employee and assistant were both drunk while setting up the electric chair, and Francis did not die. The state sought to execute him again, but Francis claimed this violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The state's failure to execute Francis the first time should mark the end of the attempt, Burton wrote. Additional attempts constituted cruel and unusual punishment: \\"It is unthinkable that any state legislature in modern times would enact a statute expressly authorizing capital punishment by repeated applications of an electric current separated by intervals of days or hours until finally death shall result.\\" It was an opinion that showed \\"considerable foresight\\" regarding the Supreme Court's future capital punishment jurisprudence. =Antitrust= Burton's greatest contribution to Supreme Court jurisprudence came in the area of antitrust law. In American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U.S. 781 (1946), Burton wrote for a near-unanimous court (Justice Rutledge, concurring) that the Sherman Antitrust Act barred the mere existence of combinations or conspiracies which created monopolistic or oligopolistic market power, regardless of whether that power was actually used. Legal scholar Eugene V. Rostow declared Burton's decision would usher in a new era of swift, effective antitrust enforcement. But Burton's analysis cut both ways. In United States v. Columbia Steel Company, 334 U.S. 495 (1948), the same reasoning was used to allow U.S. Steel to buy out the much smaller Columbia Steel. Even though Columbia Steel was the largest steel manufacturer on the West Coast, Burton joined the majority in holding that the acquisition was not a violate of the Clayton Antitrust Act because Columbia Steel represented such a small percentage of overall American steel production. The Columbia Steel decision shocked antitrust advocates. Yet, in Lorain Journal Co. v. United States, 342 U.S. 143 (1951), Burton wrote for a unanimous court that a monopoly could not use its power to retain its monopoly position. In that case, the Lorain Journal newspaper attempted to use its market power to prevent advertisers from placing ads with a new, competing radio station. The case became noted for extending the federal government's antitrust power to local markets. In Times-Picayune Publishing Co. v. United States, 345 U.S. 594 (1953), the majority held that the Times-Picayune newspaper did not violate the Sherman Antitrust Act by forcing advertisers to buy space in both its evening and morning editions. Burton (joined by Black, Douglas, and Minton) strongly dissented. The Sherman Act barred all monopolistic market power, he argued, whether it was used to create or maintain a monopoly, or whether it was used to harm the public (through monopolistic pricing) or users (as in the Times-Picayune \\"must buy\\" case). Burton wrote the lone dissent in Toolson v. New York Yankees, Inc., 346 U.S. 356 (1953). A majority of the justices had disposed of the case in a per curiam decision, citing the ruling in Federal Baseball Club v. National League, 259 U.S. 200 (1922). Citing extensive statistics about the farm system, broadcasting revenues, and national advertising campaigns, Burton concluded it was unreasonable to claim that major league baseball was not engaged in interstate commerce. He strongly criticized the majority for incorrectly construing Federal Baseball Club, and said the majority was wrong to assumed that because the Sherman Antitrust Act did not explicitly cover baseball that baseball was intended to be exempt. A notable exception to the broad application of antitrust law came in Burton's dissent in United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, 353 U.S. 586 (1957). The DuPont chemical company had purchased a substantial bloc of stock in the General Motors automobile manufacturer. Subsequently, General Motors purchased most of its paints and fabrics from DuPont. A majority of the court held that this vertical integration constituted a violation of the Clayton Antitrust Act. But Burton, dissenting, was highly skeptical that the Clayton Act applied to vertical integration, and strongly criticized the majority's logic concerning market power. Burton found that du Pont simply didn't have the market power the majority claimed it did. The dissent drew widespread praised from legal scholars. =Racial segregation= Burton's other major contribution to Supreme Court jurisprudence came in the area of racial segregation. Burton had been a member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People from 1941 to 1945, and was a dependable vote for civil rights on the high court. One of the exceptions was his first civil rights case on the court, Morgan v. Virginia, 328 U.S. 373 (1946). Burton was the lone dissenter in the case, which involved the racial segregation of interstate buses with curtains. Burton argued that, in the absence of a federal statute, each state should be free to establish its own laws on racial segregation. After his vote in Morgan, Court observers believed that Burton could not be counted on to vote to expand or protect civil rights. It surprised legal analysts, then, when Burton joined the unanimous majority in Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 US 1 (1948), a landmark case that held courts could not enforce covenants in real estate which were racially discriminating. In a string of votes over the next three years, Burton voted to undermine the \\"separate but equal\\" doctrine in Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 US 537 (1896). He joined the unanimous majority in Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629, in 1950, which held that \\"separate but equal\\" professional legal education was unconstitutional. Heman Marion Sweatt, an African American man, was refused admission to the all-white University of Texas School of Law. One of the first cases to find that \\"separate but equal\\" was not equal, the case deeply influenced the Court's opinion in Brown v. Board of Education four years later. During the Sweatt deliberations, Burton came to the conclusion that Plessy v. Ferguson should be reversed. He informed the other justices about his conclusion the during post-oral argument conference on Sweatt. The same year, Burton joined the unanimous majority in McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents, 339 U.S. 637, which racially desegregated all graduate schools in the United States on essentially the same grounds as Sweatt. Burton subsequently wrote the unanimous majority opinion in Henderson v. United States, 339 U.S. 816 (1950). The case involved interstate travel on a passenger train. Henderson, an African American federal worker, held a ticket that cost the same and allegedly provided the same level of service as a ticket sold to a white passenger. But Henderson was denied seating in the dining car after attendants seated white passengers at the tables reserved for blacks. Although the Sweatt and McLaurin courts had ruled on constitutional grounds, Burton hesitated to do so if there were procedural or technical grounds to do so. In Henderson, Burton was able to form a unanimous majority by basing his decision on the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, rather than the 14th Amendment. By 1953, Burton's thinking on racial segregation had evolved to embrace a constitutional attack on Plessy. In 1953, the Supreme Court took up Terry v. Adams, 345 U.S. 461, a case in which a whites-only private political club dominated the local Democratic primary election in an electoral district where Republicans were not competitive. This system served to disenfranchise black voters. The federal district and appellate courts had upheld the constitutionality of the system, persuaded that the club was purely private and thus no state action was involved. But at the first post-oral argument conference held by the justices, Burton was adamant that the Supreme Court reverse and declare the practice unconstitutional. The justices took a widely varying approach to the case. The majority opinion was authored by Hugo Black, and joined only by Burton and Douglas. Frankfurter, personally at odds with Black, joined the majority but authored his own opinion (which he refused to have listed as \\"concurring\\"). Clark authored a concurrence, which was joined by Vinson, Reed, and Jackson. Surprisingly, Burton joined Black in declaring the whites-only club in violation of the 15th Amendment. Black won over all but one justice (Minton) by agreeing to remand the case back to the district court for a solution, but not specifying what that solution should be. Role in Brown v. Board of Education Burton played a crucial role in the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954). Several cases alleging unconstitutional racial discrimination in elementary and secondary public schools were coming before the court in 1952. In the first sign that Burton was ready to reverse Plessy, on June 7 Burton voted with Clark and Minton to grant certiorari to both Brown and another case, Briggs v. Elliott, 342 U.S. 350 (1952). The Supreme Court subsequently agreed to also hear Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497 (1954), Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, 103 F. Supp. 337 (1952), and Gebhart v. Belton, 91 A.2d 137 (Del. 1952). Oral argument in all five cases was heard at early December 1952. The justices held their first post-oral argument judicial conference on the cases on December 13. Burton, Black, Douglas, and Minton had all come out against racial segregation in the public schools during the conference. Clark seemed unsure, but it appeared that he could be persuaded to join the majority. Burton himself noted in his diary that he felt the court was likely to vote 6-to-3 to bar on racial discrimination in schools, but not on constitutional grounds. Other justices were not so sure. William O. Douglas believed that five justices would vote to uphold Plessy: Vinson, Clark, Frankfurter, Jackson and Reed. Among these, Frankfurter and Jackson exhibited the most doubt about Plessy. Douglas even worried that a 5-to-4 decision would be reached in which schools would be given a decade or more to bring unequal African American schools up to par. Vinson was a fence-sitter of a different kind: He was deeply troubled by the effect a desegregation order would have on the nation. It was likely that, even if Vinson joined a majority in barring \\"separate but equal\\" in public schools, he would do so only on narrow, technical grounds‚Äîleading to a plurality decision, a fragmented court, and a ruling lacking in legal and moral weight. Frankfurter, who personally believed racial segregation to be \\"odious\\", argued for the cases to be held over to the next term and reargued. A majority of the court agreed. Some hoped for changes in the political landscape that would make a decision easier, while others worried about the effect a divided opinion would have. On June 8, the Supreme Court issued its order, scheduling reargument for October 12, 1953. Chief Justice Fred Vinson died unexpectedly of a heart attack on September 8, 1953. On September 30, President Eisenhower nominated Earl Warren, the outgoing Republican governor of California, to replace Vinson as Chief Justice. The news was not unexpected; Warren had declined a fourth term as governor on September 2, and he had long been seen as a favorite for a Supreme Court nomination. Warren's was a recess appointment, which meant he would have to give up his seat unless the Senate confirmed him before the end of its next session. Warren was sworn in as Chief Justice on October 5. Warren's nomination was sent to the Senate on January 11, 1954. Senator William Langer, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, kept the nomination bottled up for seven weeks in order to hold hearings on unsubstantiated charges that Warren was a Marxist and controlled by the California liquor lobby. Warren's nomination was forwarded to the Senate on February 24 on a favorable 12-to-3 vote, and the Senate confirmed him on March 1 on a voice vote after just eight minutes of discussion. Even before oral reargument, Warren was convinced that Plessy had to be reversed and racial discrimination in public education ended. Warren perceived Burton as a key ally in overturning Plessy. Immediately after his swearing-in ceremony, Warren worked hard to become as friendly as possible with Burton, quietly seeking him out before any of the more senior justices. (Had Warren's actions become widely known, he would have offended court tradition and the other justices.) Reargument in Brown and the other cases was set for early December 1953. The first post-oral reargument conference was held December 12, at which time Warren made it very clear he would join Black, Burton, Douglas, and Minton in voting to overturn Plessy. Warren believed a unanimous decision in Brown was necessary to win public acceptance for the decision. Stanley Forman Reed appeared to Warren to be the justice most comfortable with segregation and Plessy. But even Reed admitted on December 12 that what was constitutional in 1896 might not be in 1953, due to changing circumstances. Warren went to work on Reed immediately. During the lunch break on December 12, Warren invited Reed (the justice most unlikely to oppose segregation) to lunch, accompanied by Burton, Black, Minton, and Douglas (the justices most likely to bar segregation). The social pressure on Reed continued for the next five days, as Warren lunched daily with Reed, Burton, Black, and Minton. Burton wholeheartedly supported Warren's attempt to forged a unanimous majority. Warren accurately judged Burton to be his most valuable ally in forging a unanimous majority on Brown. Burton not only pushed for pragmatic solutions (which helped win over Reed), but proved to be articulate, passionate, and persuasive‚Äîwhich few on the court expected. As the justices continued to debate its approach to Brown and the other cases in conferences, in memoranda, and privately among themselves, Burton worked to alleviate fears about implementation by talking freely about his experiences as mayor of Cleveland. Burton had ended racial discrimination in healthcare by hiring African American nurses to work in whites-only hospitals. This had gone relatively smoothly, and black nurses earned widespread respect among white citizens for their professionalism. The efforts of Warren and Burton paid off. The Supreme Court handed down a unanimous decision in Brown on May 17, 1954. Pragmatically, Warren declined to overturn Plessy, but argued that it did not apply to the field of public education. Implementation of the decision was left up to district courts, at a later date. During part of his time on the Supreme Court, Burton kept notes on all judicial conferences as well as a diary in which he documented the discussions he had with other justices. Burton's diary has proven to be an invaluable resource in understanding how Earl Warren achieved unanimity on Brown. =Resignation= By June 1957, Burton began suffering from significant shaking in his hands. As the 1957-1958 term began, his handwriting became difficult to read, and he began taking longer afternoon naps. He was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. The shaking in his left arm had become so severe by the start of 1958 that he decided to retire from the Supreme Court. He informed President Dwight D. Eisenhower of his decision in March. Worried about other domestic and international events, Eisenhower asked Burton to consider staying one more year, and make no public announcement. Burton agreed. In the meantime, arrangements were made to give Burton's law clerks positions at the United States Department of Justice should Burton retire before the end of the 1958-1959 Supreme Court term. Burton's condition worsened, and in June 1958 he was advised by his doctors to retire. Burton informed Chief Justice Earl Warren of his decision, and Warren urged him to stay on the court at least until September 30. A week later, Attorney General William P. Rogers met with Burton to discuss rumors that Burton was retiring. Once more, Burton reiterated his desire to leave the Court, and Rogers, too, asked him to remain until September 30. Various crises and events conspired to keep Burton from meeting with the president until July 17, at which time Burton privately informed Eisenhower of his intention to resign. (Burton had turned 70 years old on June 22, enabling him to retire at full pay.) Eisenhower asked Burton to keep the resignation private for a time. In part, this was because Eisenhower wanted time to consider a replacement without public pressure. Additionally, Eisenhower was worried that a resignation now might create unnecessary complications for the Supreme Court, which had agreed to hear the case Cooper v. Aaron. This case arose out of the Little Rock Nine situation, in which nine African American students were barred from enrolling at Little Rock Central High School by Orval Faubus, the Governor of Arkansas. William G. Cooper and other members of the Little Rock school district board of education had alleged they could not implement the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), because of public hostility and the opposition of Governor Faubus and the state legislature. The case was clearly headed for the Supreme Court: A local court had ruled in favor of the school district, and the NAACP had appealed both to an Arkansas circuit court and the U.S. Supreme Court (which, on June 30, declined to hear the appeal until the circuit court had ruled but which also had advised the circuit court to rule swiftly‚Äîbefore the school year began). The Supreme Court held a special summer session on September 11 and issued its decision on September 29, after which Burton informed his law clerks and the rest of the Supreme Court of his decision to retire. Burton publicly announced his retirement from the Supreme Court on October 6, 1958. Burton publicly announced that he was suffering from Parkinson's disease. He retired on the advice of physicians, who said the condition might improve without the stress from his Court position. His last day at the Supreme Court was October 13. Retirement Following his retirement from the Supreme Court, Burton sat by designation for several years on panels of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. He died on October 28, 1964, in Washington, D.C., from complications arising from Parkinson's disease, kidney failure, and pulmonary trouble. His remains were interred at Highland Park Cemetery in Cleveland.

Alexander refused and proclaimed himself emperor in 308. The most detailed if somewhat confusing description of the insurrection is given by Zosimus (II, 12 and 14). He reports that Maxentius sent his portrait to Africa to gain recognition as Emperor there. The troops resisted because of their loyalty to Galerius. Maxentius ordered Domitius Alexander, the vicar of Africa, to send his son to Rome to secure his loyalty. Alexander refused and was crowned Emperor by his army. The incident was probably caused by the conflict between Maxentius and his father Maximian early in 308, and Zosimos confused Galerius with Maximian in his account.Paschoud. Apart from the provinces in north Africa (today's Algeria, Tunisia and western Libya), Domitius Alexander also controlled Sardinia. At the time of his accession, he was already at an advanced age. There is evidence in an inscription (CIL viii, 22183) that Alexander and Constantine I allied themselves in opposition to Maxentius. Salama suggests that, at the latest, the pact was entered into by autumn of 310.P. Salama, \\"Recherches numismatiques sur l'usurpateur africain L. Domitius Alexander\\", Proceedings of the International Numismatic Congress, 1973, p. 365, note 2. Maxentius sent his praetorian prefect Rufius Volusianus and a certain Zenas to quell the rebellion, and Alexander was taken prisoner and then executed by strangulation. Apparently, his troops did not offer much resistance. Maxentius retaliated with confiscations of the property of alleged supporters of Alexander. The year of the end of Alexander's reign is subject to debate; dates ranging from 309 to 311 have been proposed.

The last year for the Eagle Talon‚Äîas well as the Eagle division of Chrysler‚Äîwas 1998. Characteristics The Talon, Laser and Eclipse were badge variants using the Chrysler D platform, manufactured at the DSM (Diamond Star Motors joint venture between Chrysler and Mitsubishi) manufacturing plant in Normal, Illinois. All three vehicles were mechanically identical (when comparing the same option level) including engine, transmission, and drivetrain. Cosmetically, differences between the three were found in wheels, availability of colors, taillights, front and rear bumpers, and spoilers. The Talon featured two-tone body color with a black 'greenhouse' (roof, pillars, door- mounted mirrors) regardless of the body color. The variants featured 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmissions and a hood bulge on the left-hand side of the car for camshaft clearance when equipped with the 4G63 engine. The base model DL did not use this engine, but still had a bulge as illustrated in the 1992 Talon brochure. 2nd Generation cars all had such a bulge, even with the inclusion of the 420A engine. First generation (1990‚Äì94) The first generation Talon was released in mid-1989 as a 1990 model and ran through 1994. This era of DSM vehicles is commonly referred to as the first generation, or \\"1G\\" for short. However, there were two 1G styles. The \\"1GA\\" models of 1990‚Äì1991 featured pop-up headlights lights and a \\"6-bolt\\" engine, while the \\"1GB\\" model of 1992‚Äì1994 featured composite style headlights with integrated turn signals. The 1993‚Äì1994 base model DL was front-wheel drive and used a 92-horsepower 1.8 L engine (4G37). The ES model (or just the base Talon before 1993) sported a naturally aspirated 2.0 L 135 hp Mitsubishi 4G63 engine. The TSi and TSi AWD models used the same engine but added an intercooled Mitsubishi 14b turbocharger producing 11.06 psi of peak boost from the factory, resulting in on TSi AWD models. The front-drive TSi produced only 190 hp due to a more restrictive exhaust system, and the automatics produced due to a 13g turbo. The \\"six-bolt\\" engine on all Talons built before April 1992 refers to the number of bolts connecting the flywheel to the crankshaft. All 1G Talons built after April 1992 received a freer revving \\"7-bolt\\" engine borrowed from the 1992 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution's lighter rods and seven- bolt crankshaft. The Eagle Talon was consistently featured on Car and Driver magazine's Ten Best list for 1990‚Äì1992. =1G trim levels= *base ‚Äì 1990‚Äì1992 *TSi FWD Turbo ‚Äì 1990‚Äì1994 *TSi AWD Turbo ‚Äì 1990‚Äì1994 *DL ‚Äì 1993‚Äì1994 *ES ‚Äì 1993‚Äì1994 =Production numbers= * 1990: 32,708 * 1991: 33,537 * 1992: 27,945 * 1993: 26,740 * 1994: 24,040 1992-1994 Eagle Talon TSi =Awards= The Talon Turbo was on Car and Driver magazine's Ten Best list for the years 1989 through 1992.http://www.caranddriver.com/features/1989-10best- cars-1989-mitsubishi-eclipse-turbo-plymouth-laser-turbo-page-10 Second generation (1995‚Äì98) The second-generation (or \\"2G\\") Eagle Talon was introduced in 1995 simultaneously with its Mitsubishi Eclipse counterpart, while the Plymouth Laser model was eliminated. Mechanically, the new Talon and Eclipse models were almost identical with the engines in the turbocharged versions receiving a modest increase in output thanks to a redesigned intake and exhaust, higher 8.5:1 (vs. 7.8:1) compression pistons, and new turbocharger. The new T25 turbocharger, provided by Garrett, had boost increased to 12 psi of peak boost and was smaller than the previous Mitsubishi built 14b turbo that was on 1G models. The T25 did spool up faster than the previous turbocharger in order to increase the turbo response or reduce turbo lag. The other important change concerned the suspension. While the 1G had MacPherson struts in the front, the 2G had double-wishbone in the front and multilink suspension in the rear. The double-wishbone suspension gave the 2G a much better roll-camber curve in the front, allowing for much better handling. 1997-1998 Eagle Talon From an aesthetic standpoint, the differences between the Eagle Talon and its Mitsubishi equivalent were somewhat more substantial than exhibited in the first generation models. These differences were most obvious at the rear of the car. For example, the rear fascia of the Talon featured a bumper cap with a dip in the middle to allow for a high-mounted rear license plate; rear light clusters incorporating amber turn signals (the Eclipse used red turn signals); reverse lights as part of the main rear tail light clusters (the Eclipse's reverse lights were mounted separately and lower around the mid-mounted license plate); and a sickle-shaped rear spoiler for the TSi and TSi AWD version mounted at the base of the rear window that was painted black regardless of body color (the Eclipse used a body-colored, conventional \\"basket handle\\" spoiler mounted on the rear deck). Other differences included the air intake beneath the front bumper, which did not have a body-colored splitter (minor difference), and the absence of side skirts. The hard-top Talon featured a black roof while the Eclipse had a body- colored top. turn signals, integrated reverse lights, and bumper cap comprise the rear fascia that is unique to the Eagle Talon. For the model year 1997, a design update occurred for both the Talon and the Eclipse that is sometimes referred to as \\"2Gb\\". The update was primarily limited to the non-metal portions of the car. The front and rear fascias were heavily revised to incorporate more aggressive-looking features. At the front, a larger air intake was created and the \\"Eagle\\" emblem was enlarged and embossed into the center of the bumper cap (as opposed to a badge that inset into a similarly shaped hole). At the rear, a new high-mount spoiler was introduced that projected further into the airstream, replacing the flush-mounted sickle spoiler. Added plastic moldings on the bumper caps and doors completed the revisions to the body. Lastly, on the TSi and TSi AWD models, the aluminum wheels were increased to and incorporated more angles replacing the curved 5-spoke wheel. Another important, non-cosmetic change concerned the driveline. There was a slight change in gear ratios and the number of splines on the shaft feeding power to the transfer case was altered. The TSi and TSi AWD models again featured an intercooled turbocharged engine, now replacing the 14B Mitsubishi turbo with a Garrett T25 model. Although the T25 was a smaller turbo, it spooled faster at a lower rpm resulting in increased low-end acceleration performance. The TSi AWD model retained the all-wheel drive drivetrain system. =Engines= * ESi ‚Äì 2.0 L DOHC 2.0 L 420a engine naturally aspirated I4, 140 hp (110 kW) at 6000 rpm and at 4800 rpm * TSi / TSi AWD manual transmission ‚Äì DOHC 2.0 L Mitsubishi 4G63 turbo I4, at 6000 rpm and at 3000 rpm * TSi / TSi AWD automatic transmission ‚Äì DOHC 2.0 L Mitsubishi 4G63 turbo I4, at 6000 rpm and at 3000 rpm =Standard equipment= ESi: 2.0 liter DOHC 4-cylinder engine, 5-speed manual transmission, 4-wheel disc brakes, driver and passenger airbags, variable-assist power steering, cloth reclining front bucket seats, folding rear seat, front console with storage and armrest, tinted glass, tachometer, coolant temperature gauge, trip odometer, map lights, dual remote mirrors, visor mirrors, AM/FM radio, digital clock, remote fuel door and hatch releases, tilt steering column, intermittent wipers, rear wiper/washer, rear spoiler, color-keyed bodyside moldings, 195/70R14 tires, and wheel covers.

Eagle Jazz In 1994, a concept car called the Eagle Jazz was developed for the 1995 automobile show circuit.Eagle Jazz, retrieved on 2009-06-22. \\"It was a sporty sedan with a rounded hatchback tail.

It was considered by some to have \\"a strange resemblance to a 4-door Eagle Talon\\". Some of the Eagle Jazz concept designs and ideas resurfaced in the second-generation Chrysler Concorde. Motorsport The Talon won the SCCA World Challenge touring car championship from 1990 to 1991 and the GT Touring championship from 1993 to 1995. Along with Oldsmobile (Achieva '92-'94), Eagle is one of only two American brands to win the TC championship in the 1990s. As of 2020, GM's Oldsmobile Achieva and Chevy Sonic (TCB) have accomplished this feat, along with Chrysler's Eagle Talon. The Dodge Shelby Charger won SSA of the predecessor SCCA / Escort Endurance Championship in 1986, and its Eagle Talon won SSA in 1989. Eddie Garrison drove a 1997 Eagle Talon TSi to Rookie of the Year honors in the 2007 Grand Bayou Race Series hosted by No Problem Raceway in Belle Rose, Louisiana. Garrison also won the Touring Car Class in the same Eagle Talon in 2008. Legacy The TSi nameplate appeared on Jeep's Grand Cherokee for the 1997 and 1998 model years. It was marketed as a sportier model in the line-up (with the exception of the 5.9 Limited) and featured Indigo blue trim and monochromatic scheme that was available on the Talon. The TSi name reappeared again, as a high-performance model for the Chrysler Sebring sedan, for the 2005 and 2006 model years.

On 24 March 1944 a patrol of German police came to the house of J√≥zef and Wiktoria Ulma, where they found eight Jewish members of the Szall and Goldman families. At first the Germans executed all the Jews. Then they shot the pregnant Wiktoria and her husband. When the six children began to scream at the sight of their parents' bodies, Joseph Kokott, a German police officer (Volksdeutsche from Sudetenland), shot them after consulting with his superior. The other killers were Eilert Dieken, Michael Dziewulski and Erich Wilde. Afterwards the Germans robbed the house and workshop of the Ulma family and organized an alcoholic libation. On the 60th anniversary of this tragedy, a memorial was erected in memory of the family.

History In ancient times Karaman was known as Laranda (). In the 6th century BC it came under Achaemenid rule until 322 BC, when it was destroyed by Perdiccas, a former general of Alexander the Great, after he had defeated Ariarathes, king of Cappadocia.Diodorus Siculus 18.22.1-2 It later became a seat of Isaurian pirates. At some point it was possessed by Antipater of Derbe.Strabo, Geography, ¬ß12.6.3 It belonged to the Roman and later Byzantine Empire until it was captured by the Seljuks in the early 12th century. Karaman was occupied by Frederick Barbarossa in 1190 and by Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia between 1211 and 1216. In 1256, the town was taken by Karamanoƒülu Mehmet Bey and was renamed Karaman in his honour. From 1275, Karaman was the capital of the Karamanid beylik. In 1468 the Karamanids were conquered by the Ottomans and in 1483 the capital of the province was moved to Konya. Karaman has retained ruins of a Karamanid castle and some walls, two mosques and a Koran school (madrasah) from that age. An exquisite mihrab from a mosque from Karaman can now be found in the √áinili Pavilion near the Archeology Museum in Istanbul. The Karamans were Cappadocian Turkomans who fought the Ottomans on the side of the Comnenes, became Christian and migrated westwards. There was a Roman Catholic titular see for the city. The poet Yunus Emre (c. 1238‚Äì1320) resided in Karaman during his later years and is believed to lie buried beside the Yunus Emre Mosque. A small adjacent park is adorned with quotations from his verse, many of them unfortunately graffiti- splattered. In 1222, the Sufi preacher Bahaeddin Veled arrived in town with his family, and the Karamanoƒülu emir built a medrese to accommodate them. Veled's son was the famous Mevlana Jelaluddin Rumi, who married his wife, Gevher Hatun, while his family was living in Karaman. It was here, too, that Rumi's mother died in 1224. She was buried, along with other family members, in the Aktekke Mosque (also known as the Mader-i Mevlana Cami), which Alaeddin Ali Bey had built to replace the original medrese in 1370., todayszaman.com The Greek name Karamanlis as well as other surnames beginning with Karaman refer to this town.

The southern boundary of Arauca is formed by the Casanare and Meta Rivers, separating Arauca from the departments of Casanare and Vichada. To the west, Arauca borders the department of Boyac√°. The Ca√±o Lim√≥n oil fields located within Arauca account for almost a third of the Colombian oil output. Its capital is the town of Arauca.  Etymology  The name Arauca is believed to derive from the name of an Indigenous people, who are thought to be related to the Arawak or Arhuaco people. Some have also speculated that the name Arauca is connected with the Araucanian or Mapuche Indians of Chile and Argentina.  History  The first conquistador to set foot in the region of present-day Arauca was Nikolaus Federmann in 1539. He was first a soldier in the company of Georg von Speyer, who passed through the south of present Venezuela and the eastern part of what is today known as Colombia. In 1659, the catholic missions were establishing new settlements in tribal Guahibo, U'wa, Aeric and Chirico tribal lands. In the eighteenth century, being expelled from the Jesuits under Viceroy Pedro Mesia de la Zerda, the Augustinian Recollect succeeded in their mission of evangelization. They founded five centers of the catechism: Solitude of Cravo, Cuiloto San Javier, San Jose del Ele, Lipa San Joaquin and San Fernando de Arauca. In 1810, the Araucanian territory became part of the newly created province of Casanare and in 1819 Arauca was incorporated into the province of Cundinamarca. By 1857, Arauca was made part of the Sovereign State of Boyac√°, that later became the Boyac√° department. In 1891, the Arauca police station was established with chief executive Pedro Le√≥n Acosta. By decree 113 of January 20, 1955, the territory was elevated to the national quartermaster, and finally, with the Constitution of July 5, 1991, Arauca became a department.

Ethnography  The Colombian census does not collect data on race and ethnicity, but compiled population estimates of the five groupings are: * Mestizo; mixed European- Amerindian backgrounds (could be over half or 60%) and white/unmixed European (about 33-35%) totalled at 93.70% * Black or Afro-Colombians (4.07%) * Amerindian or Indigenous (2.22%) * Roma (0.01%) * Asian (0.01%) There are small numbers of descendants of European immigrants: the Spanish, German, Portuguese, Italian, French, British, Dutch, Polish, Greek and Arab (i.e. Lebanese, Syrian and Palestinian) nationalities. Many Venezuelan nationals live in the department; around 10-15 percent of the population is of Venezuelan origin.  Indigenous population  The department's total indigenous population amounts to 3591 people. Across the department 26 resguardos are located in an area of . Six indigenous groups populate this region; U'wa with 1,124 members; Betoye at 800, Sikuani number 782, 441 Hitn√º are registered, Kuiba count up to 241, Hitan√º are listed at 110, the Chiricoa amount to 63 and thirty Piapoco are registered in Arauca.

Its total population is estimated at 7231 people, belong to the Chibcha language family. U'wa means \\"intelligent people who can speak\\". The Betoye with 800 members constitutes the second-largest ethnic group in the department. They inhabit the banks of the Cravo Norte River and the municipality of Tame. The area of its territory is . Their language is considered part of the Chibcha language family. Although not retaining their original language, the people speak a mixture of Betoye with Spanish. Certain grammatical structures of the Betoye language persist in this mixture. The Guahibo are subdivided into tribes known as Sikuani, Kuiba, Chiricoa, Hitan√º (iguana) and Hitn√º (Macaguane), who speak Arawakan languages.  Economy  The main economical activity of Arauca is centered around the oil industry, with the Ca√±o Lim√≥n oilfields as the most important source. The soils of the region have shown good conditions for growing cacao, bananas, cassava, rice, corn and fruit trees, as well as industrial crops such as African palmtree, sorghum, soybeans and sesame. Livestock farming is another important factor of the department's economy.

Much of this area is still referred to as either Bushwick, Williamsburg, or Greenpoint with the term East Williamsburg falling out of use since the 1990s.  History  Knickerbocker Avenue looking south at Grattan Street In the 18th century, Bushwick was already an established town, and the waterfront area that provided ferry service to the island of Manhattan was simply known as Bushwick Shore.* * The land of scrub bush that stood between Bushwick Shore and the town of Bushwick was known as Cripplebush. During the Revolutionary War occupation of the area by the British, the land was cleared, with the wood of the thickets being used for fuel. In 1800, Richard M. Woodhull purchased the waterfront property and laid out a settlement, naming it Williamsburgh after his friend and surveyor Colonel Jonathan Williams. Williamsburgh was incorporated as a village in 1827 (as a part of the town of Bushwick), and included 26 streets running East to West and 12 streets east of the shore line running North to South.\\"Map of the village of Williamsburgh, Kings County; As laid out by the Commissioners, appointed by the Legislature in 1827, reduced from the Large Map in possession of the Trustees of the Village\\", H. McDowell, New York, 1833. On April 18, 1835, the village of Williamsburg was extended eastward to Bushwick Avenue and to Flushing Avenue on the Southeast (then known as Newtown Road). The region that is now circumscribed on the west by Union Ave, on the south by Broadway, then along Flushing Avenue to Bushwick Avenue on the east and on the north (approximately) by the Newtown Creek was designated as the Third District of the Village of Williamsburg in 1835.\\"A Map of Williamsburgh\\", Isaac Vieth, Brooklyn, 1845. \\"The Village is divided into three districts, numbered one two and three. All west of the centre of Union Ave and south of the centre of Grand Street composes the first district; all west of Union Avenue and to the north of Grand Street composes the Second District; and all east of Union Avenue, the Third District.\\" At this time, the three districts of Williamsburg were more commonly known as the North Side, South Side, and the New Village. The names \\"North Side\\" and \\"South Side\\" remain in common usage today, but the name for the Third District has changed often. The New Village became populated by Germans and for a time was known by the sobriquet of \\"Dutchtown\\". In 1844, Williamsburg separated from the Town of Bushwick and became the Town and Village of Williamsburg. Parts of the Third District were known as \\"Irish Town\\" and \\"The Green\\" during the latter half of the 19th century. In 1854, Williamsburg was incorporated into the City of Brooklyn, which was one of the original six Dutch Townships of western Long Island. Upon consolidation with Brooklyn in 1854, Districts one (North Side) and two (South Side) became, respectively, Wards 14 and 13 of the City of Brooklyn. The third District was split and became Wards 15 and 16 of the City of Brooklyn. Ward 15 was the section north of Ten Eyck Street, between Union Avenue and Bushwick Avenue, with the addition of the portion of Ainslie, Grand, Hope, and South Second Streets between west of Union Avenue and east of Rodney Street. Ward 16 was the section south of Ten Eyck Street, bounded by Broadway, Flushing Avenue, and Bushwick Avenue.  Demographics  Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of East Williamsburg was 34,158, an increase of 2,280 (7.2%) from the 31,878 counted in 2000.

It is mainly served by the Grand Street, Montrose Avenue, and Morgan Avenue stops of the BMT Canarsie Line (). On the border with Bedford- Stuyvesant is the Flushing Avenue stop of the BMT Jamaica Line () and the Flushing Avenue stop of the IND Crosstown Line (). East Williamsburg is also served by the B24 bus on Kingsland and Meeker Avenues, the B57 on Flushing Avenue, the B60 on Johnson and Morgan Avenues, the Q54 on Metropolitan Avenue, and the Q59 on Grand Avenue. The Kosciuszko Bridge (carrying Interstate 278) and the Grand Street Bridge across the Newtown Creek connect East Williamsburg with Maspeth, Queens.  Boundaries  East Williamsburg is in Brooklyn Community Board 1New York: A City of Neighborhoods at nyc.gov and is bounded by the East River, Kent Avenue, Flushing Avenue, and the Newtown Creek. However, various parts of the East Williamsburg are served by different post offices. The neighborhood includes the zip codes 11211, served by the Williamsburg Post Office at 263 S. 4th Street; 11206, served by the Metropolitan-Bushwick Post Office at 47 Debevoise Street; 11222, served by the Greenpoint Post Office at 66 Meserole Avenue; and 11237, served by the Wyckoff Heights-Bushwick Post Office at 86 Wyckoff Avenue.A zipcode maps is available at http://www.unhp.org/pdf/maps/zip_bk.pdf There are several public housing projects in East Williamsburg, including the Williamsburg Houses, Borinquen Plaza Houses, Cooper Park Houses, John Francis Hylan Houses, and the Bushwick Houses. Greenspaces include Cooper Park.  Subsections  = East Williamsburg Industrial Park = The eastern half of East Williamsburg, roughly bounded by the Newtown Creek on the east and by I-278 and Flushing Avenue on the north and south, respectively, is mostly zoned for industry with some residential housing mixed among the warehouses and factories. The section is currently referred to by the city as the East Williamsburg Industrial Park (EWIP), or formally the East Williamsburg In-Place Industrial Park (EWIPIP).*East Williamsburg Industrial Park * Greenpoint-Williamsburg Planning Framework ‚Äì Decline in Industrial Activity (APPROVED) The western boundary runs approximately along Kinsgland Ave, then Morgan Avenue and then just east of Bushwick Avenue. The EWIP is one of eight In-Place Industrial Parks in New York City and is managed by the East Williamsburg Valley Industrial Development Corporation (EWVIDCO), a company founded in 1982 with the goal of revitalizing East Williamsburg by attracting new businesses, providing business assistance to existing firms and grow overall job opportunities in the neighborhood.Mission and History of EWVIDCO l Greenpoint-Williamsburg Rezoning Final Environmental Impact Statement, CEQR #04DCP003K , City Planning Commission, City of New York, 4 March 2005, page 2‚Äì42. Historically, this neighborhood was not part of the Village of Williamsburgh. In the late 19th century the region east of the present-day Humboldt Street, west of the Newtown Creek, south of Meeker Avenue, and north of Metropolitan Avenue was the 18th ward of the City of Brooklyn.The boundaries are defined in the 1865 New York State Census as found here The north part of the EWIP is served by the Greenpoint Post Office and is considered by some to be part of Greenpoint. The portion of the EWIP to the south of Metropolitan Avenue was historically part of Bushwick and is still referred by many as being in Bushwick. McKibbin Lofts, with low rise projects in the distance For many years a well-known landmark in East Williamsburg was a pair of cylindrical natural gas holders located on Maspeth Avenue, built in 1927 and 1948 by Brooklyn Union Gas, and demolished in 2001. See article for photographs of the demolition. = East of Bushwick Avenue = The section of Brooklyn that lies east of Bushwick Avenue, bordered by Metropolitan Avenue and Flushing Avenue on the North and South, is referred to some as being part of East Williamsburg since the region is part of EWIP. Factories and warehouses are being decommissioned due to heavy and light industry leaving the area, and were converted into loft and apartment space, similar to the residential development of the DUMBO neighborhood in Brooklyn An example of this can be seen in the adjacent picture which shows the two loft buildings on McKibbin St., 255 McKibbin and 248 McKibbin. At present it lies within the boundaries of Community Board 1, the Brooklyn Community Board for Greenpoint and Williamsburg.  Library  The Brooklyn Public Library (BPL)'s Bushwick branch is located at 340 Bushwick Avenue near Seigel Street. The Bushwick branch was founded in 1903 and its current building opened in 1908.  Culture  There are several communities and neighborhoods within East Williamsburg. Since the late 19th century, most of the immigrants to this section have come from Italy or from Puerto Rico and other Latin American countries. Graham Avenue (also known as Avenue of Puerto Rico to the south of Grand Street, and Via Vespucci to the north), Grand Street, and Metropolitan Avenue are the main shopping districts. The Moore Street Market, often referred to as La Marqueta de Williamsburg, is located at 110 Moore Street. I. DeFrancisci & Son, 219 Morgan Avenue, Brooklyn, 1917 The first wave of Italian immigration to East Williamsburg occurred in the second half of the 19th century. By the late 1880s, the neighborhood along Graham Avenue was inhabited by many Italian immigrants, as evidenced by The Saint Mary of the Snow Society at 410 Graham Avenue, established in 1888. Italians also attended St. Cecilia's Catholic Church at 84 Herbert Street, which was established in 1871 and run mainly by Irish. Other Italian societies in the neighborhood include Sabino Society on Withers St., the San Cono Society on Ainslie St. A second wave of Italian immigration occurred from World War II until the 1970s. While the neighborhood has changed significantly, the established Italian community still thrives along the north end of Graham avenue, also referred to as \\"Via Vespucci\\". The neighborhood also was home to The Motion Lounge, the former nightclub at 420 Graham Avenue owned by Bonanno crime family caporegime Dominick Napolitano. There are also many Puerto Rican residents. The south end of Graham Avenue (also known as \\"Avenue of Puerto Rico\\") has been the center of a Latin American immigrant neighborhood since the 1950s. Since the 1990s, the area has seen a great influx of young artists, professionals, students and \\"hipsters\\", mainly due to its close proximity to Manhattan and major universities (e.g. Pratt Institute, New York University, School of Visual Arts, Fashion Institute of Technology, The New School) and the relatively inexpensive rent. The rent is rising however, and the influx of said students has made housing more competitive pushing out those who cannot afford the rising cost of living in the north.

The Municipality of Arauca has a total population of 85,585 (2018 census).https://www.dane.gov.co/files/varios/informacion-capital-DANE-2019.pdf History The Arauca region was explored by the German conquistador Jorge de la Espira, or Georg von Speyer, in 1536. The early Spanish did not stay because they were on the quest for El Dorado. However, they were later followed by Jesuits and land-grantees who founded the first settlements. Arauca was founded on December 4, 1780, by Juan Isidro Dabo√≠n on the site of an indigenous hamlet of about ten families called Guahibo. Arauca was named after the Arauca River, which now separates it from Venezuela, which river in turn was named for the indigenous people the Arauca. The area is flat and subject to frequent flooding from the river. At one point, it was the capital of the New Granada Province of Casanare which was much larger than the current Department of Casanare. In addition, the Villa de Santa B√°rbara de Arauca, has been: * Capital of the Republic, under the revolutionary government, constituted July 16, 1816; * Capital of the Police District (Comisar√≠a especial) since 1911; * Capital of the Province (Intendencia Nacional) of Arauca, 1955‚Äì1991; * Oil capital of Colombia since 1986; * Capital of the Department of Arauca since 1991.

Blacks make up 5.9% of the city and Indigenous people make up 1.7% of the city. Economy Sunset over the R√≠o Arauca Since its founding, Arauca's primary business has been the raising of cattle, and this is still true. But increasingly, since 1984 it is the exploitation of nearby petroleum (oil sands) that has provided the bulk of municipal income in recent years. The building of the bridge, Puente Jos√© Antonio P√°ez, connecting it with Venezuela stimulated the economy, as did completion of the highway to Bogot√°, known as The Route of the Liberators (La Ruta de los Libertadores).

It is in the west of the country, and is the only Colombian department to have coastlines on both the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean. It contains all of Colombia's border with Panama. Its capital is Quibd√≥. Choc√≥ has a diverse geography, unique ecosystems and unexploited natural resources. However, its population has one of the lowest standards of living of all departments in Colombia. In March 2007, Colombian media reported that some 50 children starved in less than three months, creating awareness of the grave condition Choc√≥ inhabitants are facing. Infrastructure problems were also revealed. For example, despite its status as the world's rainiest lowland, with close to of annual precipitation, Quibd√≥ lacks sanitary drinking water. Map of the Dari√©n Gap and the break in the Pan-American Highway between Yaviza, Panama and Turbo, Colombia History The department was created in 1944. Its low population, mountainous and inhospitable topography, and distance from Bogot√° resulted in Choc√≥ receiving little attention from the Colombian government. During the reign of military dictator Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, his administration proposed to eliminate Choc√≥ and divide its territory between the departments of Antioquia and Valle del Cauca. But the 1957 coup d'√©tat of General Gabriel Par√≠s Gordillo overthrew Pinilla's government and ended such plans. Geography The Choc√≥ Department is covered mostly by the Baud√≥ Mountains. The Choc√≥ Department makes up most of the ecoregion known as El Choc√≥ that extends from Panama to Ecuador. The municipality of Llor√≥ holds the Highest Average Annual Precipitation record measured at 523.6 inches (13,300 mm) which makes it the wettest place in the world.NOAA Satellite and Information Service Global Measured Extremes of Temperature and Precipitation Three large rivers drain the Choc√≥ Department, the Atrato (which runs north, with tributaries that also flow north), the San Juan, and the Baud√≥. Each has many tributaries. The Baud√≥ Mountains on the coast and the inland Cordillera Occidental are cut by low valleys, with an altitude less than 1,000 meters, that form most of the territory. Most of the Choc√≥ is thick rainforest. Much of the wood for Colombia's internal consumption is harvested from the Choc√≥, with a small percentage harvested for export. Choc√≥ Department produces the majority of Colombia's significant platinum output (28,359 ounces of platinum in 2011). Choc√≥ is also Colombia's top gold-producing region (653,625 ounces in 2011). In the late 19th century, it attracted a variety of miners from many countries seeking to make their fortunes in gold. Demographics Choc√≥ is inhabited predominantly by Afro- Colombians, descendants of enslaved Africans imported and brought to this area by the Spanish colonizers after conquering the Americas. The second largest race/ethnic group are the Ember√°, a Native American people. More than half of their total population in Colombia lives in Choc√≥, some 35,500. They practice hunting and artisan fishing and live near rivers. The total population as of 2005 was less than half a million, with more than half living in the Quibd√≥ valley.

According to 2009 census, population of the district is 645,266 of which 75,853 live in the city of Yozgat. History Yozgat has been subjected to a number of surveys and excavations in the past and it has become quite clear that there is still a great deal of history located under the surface of Yozgat. Officials from the Yozgat Museum Directorate are expected to concentrate their efforts in uncovering an old world Roman bath that is said to be located in the Sarikaya neighborhood while other archaeologists are carrying out excavation work in √áadƒ±r H√∂y√ºk, home to the lost city of Pteria and one of the greatest ancient civilizations in world history. √áadƒ±r H√∂y√ºk is located close to the Peyniryemez village in the Sorgun district and excavation work is planned to continue till the month of August 2014. The first surveys were started in the year 1993. Since then archaeologists have uncovered countless artifacts belonging to 5 different ancient civilizations from the area and as well as artifacts that belong to 5 different eras ‚Äì the Bronze, Hellenistic, Hittite, Copper and Upper Byzantine eras. Surface excavations and surveys were also undertaken on the Kerkenes plateau by Dr. Geoffery Summers, a British archaeologist. The plateau is believed to be the home to the lost city of Pteria. The search for this lost city as well as other old world constructions began in 2013 and it plans to go on till the month of August as well. The expedition covers an area which is surrounded by walls and is known to date back to almost 2600 years. Lincoln at Forgotten Books According to historical reports, Pteria was destroyed, burned and abandoned during the Battle of the Eclipse between the Lydians and the Medes. This battle ended during a solar eclipse on 28 May 585 BC and it was understood to be an omen that the gods wanted the fighting to stop. Another excavation site in the region that deserves to be mentioned is in Kusaklu Tumulus. A team headed by Dr. Stefania Mazzoni has been working at the site since the year 2008 and it is believed that the Hittite civilization as well as the city of Zippalandawas once existed in the region. As a part of these excavations a 2000 year old Roman bath that was said to be used to heal people from their wounds has been discovered. Traces of the Roman, Seljuq, Byzantine and Ottoman eras have also been found in the region. With so much of history yet to be uncovered from a single city, archaeologists remain hopeful of unearthing many more wonders of the ancient world in the next few months. It has already been proved that the area was home to numerous civilizations that date all the way back to the Roman era. Archaeologists remain hopeful of managing to unearth many more old world structures and secrets as time passes by. After the old administrative center of the region, Tavium (B√ºy√ºknefes), became ruined, a new centre was created by √áapanoƒülu, the founder of a powerful derebey family and called Bozok. The Ottoman Empire annexed Yozgat in 1398. At around 1911, it was the chief town of a sanjak of the same name in the Ankara Vilayet. There was a trade in yellow madder (Stil de grain yellow) and mohair. The sanjak was very fertile, and contained good breeding-grounds in which cattle, horses and even camels were reared for the local agriculture and foreign trade. Yozgat was the site of a prisoner of war camp in the First World War, holding British and Empire officers captured at the Siege of Kut, including E. H. Jones and C. W. Hill whose escape attempts were recounted in the book The Road to En-dor. Cuisine The most notable dishes of the region are Testi Kebabƒ± (Cruse Kebab) and Araba≈üƒ± √áorbasƒ± (Araba≈üƒ± Soup). Geography The town is located at an elevation of 4,380 ft (1,335 m), situated 105 mi (170 km) east of Ankara, near the head of a narrow valley through which the Ankara‚ÄìSivas road runs. Like much of the Anatolian Plateau, the lands around Yozgat have been deforested over thousands of years of human habitation. This makes the climate and weather harsh, in summers and winters. However, Turkey has taken great steps to reforest at least some of the region. =Climate= Yozgat has a warm dry-summer continental climate (K√∂ppen Climate Classification: Dsb) with cold and snowy winters due to its inland location and warm and dry summers. Hottest month averages at during the day. Winter temperatures can drop as low as at the height of the season. Sights Yozgat Clock Tower The main sights of the city of Yozgat are the Yozgat Clock Tower built in 1908 and the √áapanoƒülu Mosque built by the √áapanoƒülu family, who are the founders of Yozgat.

Alois Hitler was born illegitimately, and his paternity was never established. This led to claims that his wife Klara (Adolf's mother) may have been his cousin. It also meant that Adolf Hitler could not prove who his grandfather was and thus prove his own \\"Aryan descent\\". When Alois was promoted in the Customs service, he applied to be legitimised in the name of his stepfather Hiedler, which was entered in the register as 'Hitler', for unknown reasons. Early life Alois Hitler was originally born Alois Schicklgruber in the hamlet of Strones, a parish of D√∂llersheim in the Waldviertel of northwest Lower Austria; he was the son of a 42-year-old unmarried peasant, Maria Schicklgruber, whose family had lived in the area for generations. At his baptism in D√∂llersheim, the space for his father's name on the baptismal certificate was left blank and the priest wrote \\"illegitimate\\".Toland, John Adolf Hitler, Doubleday & Company, 1976, pp. 3‚Äì5.Shirer, William L The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, Simon & Schuster, 1960, p. 7.Kershaw, Ian Hitler, 1889‚Äì1936: Hubris, WW Norton & Co, 2000, pp. 3‚Äì9 His mother cared for Alois in a house she shared with her elderly father, Johannes Schicklgruber. The home of Johann Nepomuk Hiedler in Spital, Lower Austria (1807‚Äì1888) Sometime later, Johann Georg Hiedler moved in with the Schicklgrubers; he married Maria when Alois was five. By the age of 10, Alois had been sent to live with Hiedler's brother, Johann Nepomuk Hiedler, who owned a farm in the nearby village of Spital (part of Weitra). Alois attended elementary school, and took lessons in shoemaking from a local cobbler. At the age of 13 he left the farm in Spital and went to Vienna as an apprentice cobbler, working there for about five years. In response to a recruitment drive by the Austrian government offering employment in the civil service to people from rural areas, Alois joined the frontier guards (customs service) of the Austrian Finance Ministry in 1855 at the age of 18. =Biological father= Historians have proposed various candidates as Alois's biological father: Johann Georg Hiedler, his brother Johann Nepomuk Hiedler (or H√ºttler), and Leopold Frankenberger (whose actual existence has never been documented).Frank McDonough, Hitler and the rise of the Nazi Party, Pearson Education, 2003, p. 20. During his lifetime, Johann Georg Hiedler was the stepfather and posthumously legally declared birth father of Alois.Kershaw, Ian. Hitler, 1889‚Äì1936: Hubris, W. W. Norton & Company, 2000, p. 4. According to historian Frank McDonough, the most plausible theory is that Hiedler was actually the birth father. An explanation for Alois being sent to live on his uncle's farm as a child is that Hiedler and Maria were simply too poor to raise him, or could not raise him as well as his uncle, or perhaps Maria's health was in decline. Historian Werner Maser suggests that Alois's father was Johann Nepomuk, Georg's brother and Hitler's step-uncle, who raised Alois through adolescence, and later willed him a considerable portion of his life savings, but never admitted publicly to being his real father. According to Maser, Nepomuk was a married farmer who had an affair and then arranged to have his single brother Hiedler marry Alois's mother Maria to provide a cover for Nepomuk's desire to assist and care for Alois, without upsetting his wife. This assumes Hiedler was willing to marry Maria in this situation, and Adolf Hitler biographer Joachim Fest thinks this is too contrived and unlikely to be true. Alois's son Adolf, following the rumours that his paternal grandfather was a Jew, in 1931 ordered the Schutzstaffel (SS) to investigate the alleged rumours regarding his ancestry; unsurprisingly, they found no evidence of any Jewish ancestors. After the Nuremberg Laws came into effect in Nazi Germany, Hitler ordered the genealogist Rudolf Koppensteiner to publish a large illustrated genealogical tree showing his ancestry; this was published in the book Die Ahnentafel des Fuehrers (\\"The Pedigree of the Leader\\") in 1937, and concluded that Hitler's family were all Austrian Germans with no Jewish ancestry, and that Hitler had an unblemished \\"Aryan\\" pedigree. As Alois himself legitimised Johann Georg Hiedler as his father and the priest changed this on his birth certificate in 1876, this was considered certified proof for Hitler's ancestry; thus Hitler was considered a \\"pure\\" Aryan. Although Johann Georg Hiedler was considered the officially accepted paternal grandfather of Adolf Hitler by the Third Reich, the question of who his grandfather was has caused much speculation and remains unknown. German historian Joachim Fest wrote that: After the war, Adolf Hitler's former lawyer, Hans Frank, claimed that Hitler told him in 1930 that one of his relatives was trying to blackmail him by threatening to reveal his alleged Jewish ancestry.Rosenbaum, Ron Explaining Hitler, New York: Random House 1998, pp. 20‚Äì22. Adolf Hitler asked Frank to find out the facts. Frank says he determined that at the time Maria Schicklgruber gave birth to Alois she was working as a household cook in the town of Graz, that her employers were a Jewish family named Frankenberger, and that her child might have been conceived out of wedlock with the family's 19-year-old son, Leopold Frankenberger.Rosenbaum, Ron Explaining Hitler, New York: Random House 1998, pp. 20‚Äì21. However, all Jews had been expelled from the province of Styria - which includes Graz - in the 15th century; they were not officially allowed to return until the 1860s, when Alois was around 30. Also, there is no evidence of a Frankenberger family living in Graz at that time. Scholars such as Ian Kershaw and Brigitte Hamann dismiss the Frankenberger hypothesis, which had only Frank's speculation to support it, as baseless. Kershaw cites several stories circulating in the 1920s about Hitler's alleged Jewish ancestry, including one about a \\"Baron Rothschild\\" in Vienna in whose household Maria Schicklgruber had worked for some time as a servant. Kershaw discusses and also lists Hitler's family tree in his biography of Adolf Hitler and gives no support to the Frankenberger tale.Kershaw, Ian. Hitler, A Biography, W. W. Norton & Company, 2008, pp. 2‚Äì4. Further, Frank's story contains several inaccuracies and contradictions, such as he said \\"The fact that Adolf Hitler had no Jewish blood in his veins, seems, from what has been his whole manner, so blatant to me that it needs no further word\\", also the statement Frank had made that Maria Schicklgruber came from \\"Leonding near Linz\\", when in fact she came from the hamlet of Strones, near the village of D√∂llersheim.Rosenbaum, Ron Explaining Hitler, New York: Random House 1998 p. 21. In 2019, Leonard Sax published a scholarly paper titled \\"Aus den Gemeinden von Burgenland: revisiting the question of Adolf Hitler's paternal grandfather\\". Sax showed that Hamann, Kershaw, and other leading historians relied, either directly or indirectly, on a single source for the claim that no Jews were living in Graz prior to 1856: that source was the Austrian historian Nikolaus von Preradovich, whom Sax showed was a fervent admirer of Adolf Hitler. Sax cited primary Austrian sources from the 1800s to demonstrate that there was in fact ‚Äì \\"a small, now settled community\\" ‚Äì of Jews living in Graz prior to 1856. Sax's article has been picked up by a number of news outlets and Sax was interviewed by Eric Metaxas on this topic, on Metaxas' TV show. Ron Rosenbaum suggests that Frank, who had turned against Nazism after 1945 but remained an anti-Semitic fanatic, made the claim that Hitler had Jewish ancestry as a way of proving that Hitler was a Jew and not an Aryan.Rosenbaum, Ron. Explaining Hitler, New York: Random House 1998 pp. 21, 30‚Äì31. Early career Alois Hitler always wore his uniform, and insisted on being addressed as Herr Oberoffizial Hitler.\\"The Mind of Adolf Hitler\\", Walter C. Langer, New York 1972 p.115 Alois Schicklgruber made steady progress in the semi-military profession of customs official. The work involved frequent reassignments and he served in a variety of places across Austria. By 1860, after five years of service, he reached the rank of Finanzwach- Oberaufseher (Revenue guard superintendent). By 1864, after special training and examinations, he had advanced further and was serving in Linz, Austria. He later became an inspector of customs posted at Braunau am Inn in 1875. He eventually rose to full inspector of customs and could go no higher because he lacked the necessary school degrees. =Change of surname= As a rising young junior customs official, he used his birth name of Schicklgruber, but in mid-1876, 39 years old and well established in his career, he asked permission to use his stepfather's family name. He appeared before the parish priest in D√∂llersheim and asserted that his father was Johann Georg Hiedler, who had married his mother and now wished to legitimize him. Three relatives appeared with him as witnesses, one of whom was Johann Nepomuk, Hiedler's brother. The priest agreed to amend the birth certificate, the civil authorities automatically processed the church's decision and Alois Schicklgruber had a new name. The official change, registered at the government office in Mistelbach in 1877, transformed him into \\"Alois Hitler\\". It is not known who decided on the spelling of Hitler instead of Hiedler. Johann Georg's brother was sometimes known by the surname H√ºttler. Bradley F. Smith states that Alois Schicklgruber openly admitted having been born out of wedlock before and after the name change.Smith, Bradley F. Adolf Hitler: His Family, Childhood and Youth. Hoover Institute, 1967 Alois may have been influenced to change his name for the sake of legal expediency. Historian Werner Maser claims that in 1876, Franz Schicklgruber, the administrator of Alois's mother's estate, transferred a large sum of money (230 gulden) to him.Werner Maser ‚Äì Hitler: Legend, Myth and Reality (in German, 1971; Penguin Books Ltd 1973 ) Supposedly, Johann Georg Hiedler, who died in 1857, relented on his deathbed and left an inheritance to his illegitimate stepson (Alois) together with his name.\\"The Mind of Adolf Hitler\\", Walter C. Langer, New York 1972 p.111 Some Schicklgrubers remain in the Waldviertel. Personal life =Illegitimate daughter= In early 1869, Alois Hitler had an affair with Thekla Penz (born 24 September 1844) of Leopoldstein, Arbesbach in the district of Zwettel, Lower Austria. This led to the birth of Theresia Penz on 31 October 1869. Thekla later married a man by the name of Horner, while Theresia married Johan Ramer and gave birth to at least six children, while living in the town of Schwertberg. =Early married life= Alois Hitler was 36 years old in 1873 when he married for the first time. Anna Glasl-H√∂rer was a wealthy, 50-year- old daughter of a customs official. She was infirm when they married and was either an invalid or became one shortly afterwards. Not long after marrying his first wife, Anna, Alois began an affair with Franziska \\"Fanni\\" Matzelsberger, one of the young female servants employed at the Pommer Inn, house number 219, in the city of Braunau am Inn, where he was renting the top floor as a lodging. Smith states that Alois had numerous affairs in the 1870s, resulting in his wife initiating legal action; on 7 November 1880 Alois and Anna separated by mutual agreement. The 19-year-old Matzelsberger became the 43-year-old Hitler's girlfriend. In 1876, three years after Alois married Anna, he had hired Klara P√∂lzl as a household servant. She was the 16-year-old granddaughter of Hitler's step-uncle (and possible father or biological uncle) Nepomuk. If Nepomuk was Hitler's father, Klara was Alois's half-niece. If his father was Johann Georg, she was his first cousin once removed. Matzelsberger demanded that the \\"servant girl\\" Klara find another job, and Hitler sent P√∂lzl away. On 13 January 1882, Matzelsberger gave birth to Hitler's illegitimate son, also named Alois, but since they were not married, the child's last name was Matzelsberger, making him \\"Alois Matzelsberger\\". Alois Hitler kept Matzelsberger as his wife while his lawful wife (Anna) grew sicker and died on 6 April 1883. The next month, on 22 May at a ceremony in Braunau with fellow custom officials as witnesses, Alois, 45, married Matzelsberger, 21. He then legitimized his son as Alois Hitler Jr. Alois's second child, Angela, was born on 28 July 1883. Alois was secure in his profession and no longer an ambitious climber. Historian Alan Bullock described him as \\"hard, unsympathetic and short-tempered\\".Bullock, Alan Hitler: A Study in Tyranny, Harper&Row; Publishers, 1962, p. 25 Matzelsberger, still only 23, acquired a lung disorder and became too ill to function. She was moved to Ranshofen, a small village near Braunau. During the last months of Matzelsberger's life, Klara P√∂lzl returned to Alois's home to look after the invalid and the two children (Alois Jr. and Angela).\\"The Mind of Adolf Hitler\\", Walter C. Langer, New York 1972 p. 114 Matzelsberger died in Ranshofen on 10 At 1884 at the age of 23. After the death of his second wife, P√∂lzl remained in his home as housekeeper. =Marriage to Klara P√∂lzl and family life= Gasthaus Wiesinger in February 2009 P√∂lzl was soon to be pregnant by Alois Hitler. Smith writes that if Hitler had been free to do as he wished, he would have married P√∂lzl immediately but because of the affidavit concerning his paternity, Hitler was now legally P√∂lzl's first cousin once removed, too close to marry. He submitted an appeal to the church for a humanitarian waiver.Alois petitioned the church for an episcopal dispensation citing \\"bilateral affinity in the third degree touching the second\\" to describe his rather complicated family relationship to Klara. The local bishop apparently believed this relationship was too close to approve on his own authority, so he forwarded the petition to Rome on behalf of Alois, seeking instead a papal dispensation, which was approved before the birth of the couple's first child. See Rosenblum article. Permission came, and on 7 January 1885 a wedding was held at Hitler's rented rooms on the top floor of the Pommer Inn. A meal was served for the few guests and witnesses. Hitler then went to work for the rest of the day. Even Klara found the wedding to be a short ceremony.The marriage took place early in the morning, and Klara is said to have complained: \\"We were married at six o'clock in the morning, and my husband was already at work at seven.\\" On 17 May 1885, four months after the wedding, the new Frau Klara Hitler gave birth to her first child, Gustav. In 1886, she gave birth to a daughter, Ida. In 1887 Otto was born, but died days later. During the winter of 1887‚Äì1888, diphtheria struck the Hitler household, resulting in the deaths of both Gustav (8 December) and Ida (2 January). On 20 April 1889, she gave birth to another son, future dictator of Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler. Adolf was a sickly child, and his mother fretted over him. Alois was 51 when he was born, and had little interest in child-rearing; he left it all to his wife. When not at work he was either in a tavern or busy with his hobby, keeping bees. Alois was transferred from Braunau to Passau. He was 55, Klara 32, Alois Jr. 10, Angela 9, and Adolf was three years old. Beginning on 1 August, the family lived at Theresienstr. 23. One month after Alois accepted a better paying position in Linz, on 1 April 1893, his wife and the children moved to a second floor room on Kapuzinerstr. 31.Anna Rosmus: Hitlers Nibelungen, Samples Grafenau 2015, p. 20f Klara had just given birth to Edmund, so it was decided she and the children would stay in Passau for the time being.The Life and Death of Adolf Hitler, Robert Payne, 1973, p. 17 On 21 January 1896, Paula, Adolf's younger sister, was born. She was the last child of Alois Hitler and Klara P√∂lzl. Alois was often home with his family. He had five children ranging in age from infancy to 14. Edmund (the youngest of the boys) died of measles on 2 February 1900. Alois Hitler wanted his son Adolf to seek a career in the civil service. However, Adolf had become so alienated from his father that he was repulsed by his wishes. He sneered at the thought of a lifetime spent enforcing petty rules. Alois tried to browbeat his son into obedience, while Adolf did his best to be the opposite of whatever his father wanted. Robert G. L. Waite noted, \\"Even one of his closest friends admitted that Alois was 'awfully rough' with his wife [Klara] and 'hardly ever spoke a word to her at home'.\\" If Alois was in a bad mood, he picked on the older children or Klara herself, in front of them. William Patrick Hitler says that he had heard from his father, Alois Jr., that Alois Hitler Sr. used to beat his children. After Hitler and his eldest son Alois Jr. had a climactic and violent argument, Alois Jr. left home, and the elder Alois swore he would never give the boy a penny of inheritance beyond what the law required. According to reports, Alois Hitler liked to lord it over his neighbors. The couch on which Alois Hitler died The Hitlers' tombstone photographed c.1984 Retirement and death In February 1895, Alois Hitler purchased a house on a plot in Hafeld near Lambach, approximately southwest of Linz. The farm was called the Rauscher Gut. He moved his family to the farm and retired on 25 June 1895 at the age of 58, after 40 years in the customs service. He found farming difficult; he lost money, and the value of the property declined. On the morning of 3 January 1903, Alois went to the Gasthaus Wiesinger (no. 1 Michaelsbergstrasse, Leonding) as usual to drink his morning glass of wine. He was offered the newspaper and promptly collapsed. He was taken to an adjoining room and a doctor was summoned, but he died at the inn, probably from a pleural hemorrhage. Adolf Hitler, who was 13 when his father died, wrote in Mein Kampf that he died of a \\"stroke of apoplexy\\".Mein Kampf, by Adolf Hitler, 4% In his book, The Young Hitler I Knew, Hitler's childhood friend August Kubizek recalled, \\"When the fourteen-year-old son saw his dead father he burst out into uncontrollable weeping.\\" =Removal of tombstone= On 28 March 2012, by the account of Kurt Pittertschatscher, the pastor of the parish, the tombstone marking Alois Hitler's grave and that of his wife Klara, in Town Cemetery in Leonding, was removed by a descendant. The descendant is said to be an elderly female relative of Alois Hitler's first wife, Anna, who has also given up any rights to the rented burial plot. The plot was covered in white gravel and a tree which has since been removed. It is not known whether the remains of Adolf Hitler's parents are still interred there.

It was published by Tor Books and released on September 15, 1992. The unabridged audio book is read by Michael Kramer and Kate Reading. At 393,823 words, The Shadow Rising is the longest book of The Wheel of Time although it has fewer pages than Lord of Chaos. The Shadow Rising consists of 58 chapters. It is the first book in the main sequence of The Wheel of Time not to contain a prologue. Plot summary Rand al'Thor has just claimed the crystal sword Callandor to prove himself the Dragon Reborn. He is approached by Lanfear, who tells him of the Forsaken's plans. However, the fortress known as the Stone of Tear is stormed by Trollocs and Fades, sent by another Forsaken (Sammael), while a third, Semirhage, sends her followers into the Stone, to oppose Sammael's forces. In defense, Rand uses Callandor to create a lightning storm killing all the Trollocs and Fades. Rand then decides that he must travel to the Aiel Waste, to be acknowledged as the Aiel's prophecised leader. Before leaving, Rand, Mat Cauthon, and Moiraine Damodred visit a ter'angreal that lets them talk to a mysterious snakelike race called the Aiefinn, who seemingly know the answer to any question. Mat learns from them that he must go to Rhuidean or die and also that he is destined to marry someone called \\"the Daughter of the Nine Moons\\". Egwene al'Vere and the Aiel Aviendha are also summoned to the Aiel Waste, Egwene to learn Dreamwalking and Aviendha to become a Wise One. Thus, Rand, Mat, Moiraine, Egwene, and Aviendha all travel to the Aiel Waste. Other characters in the Stone of Tear also learn that they must travel elsewhere. Perrin Aybara hears of trouble in The Two Rivers, his native region, and returns thereto, accompanied by Faile Bashere. Elayne Trakand, Nynaeve al'Meara, and Thom Merrilin depart to Tarabon to hunt the Black Ajah. Finally, Min Farshaw arrives in Tar Valon to report to the Amyrlin Siuan Sanche. Thus, The Shadow Rising follows four groups of characters in four plotlines. =Aiel Waste= Rand teleports Mat, Egwene, Moiraine, and the Aiel at the Stone of Tear to the Aiel Waste, where Taardad and Shaido Aiel are waiting for them. Moiraine, Aviendha , Mat, and Rand enter Rhuidean, a legendary forbidden city of the waste. All three enter ter'angreal in Rhuidean. Rand there relives portions of the lives of his paternal ancestors, before and after the Breaking, and learns that the Aiel once shunned violence and served Aes Sedai, whereof some, adhering to pacifism, live on as Tinkers, while others known as the 'Jenn Aiel', carried a large collection of angreal, sa'angreal, and ter'angreal to Rhuidean. Rand emerges with dragon markings on both arms; thus proving himself the Car'a'carn: the 'Chief of Chiefs' of the Aiel. Mat enters a ter'angreal similar to the one he entered in Tear, seeking answers to the questions he asked of the 'Aelfinn' of his previous visit; but encounters the Foxlike 'Eelfinn', who bargain for gifts instead of answering questions. Not knowing this, Mat accidentally requests several gifts from them: fluency in the Old Tongue and the memories of his own ancestors, a spear called an ashandarei, and a medallion ter'angreal that protects against the One Power. Rand finds Mat hanged from the Tree of Life as the price for these gifts; but revives Mat, who thereafter wears a black scarf to hide the resulting scars. Moiraine, having visited the three-hooped ter'angreal used by the Wise Ones, gains some knowledge of the future. The Wise Ones assign Aviendha the task of teaching Rand Aiel customs as they travel to Cold Rocks Hold; they are later accompanied by merchants who are in fact darkfriends and Forsaken in disguise. At Al'cair Dal, both Rand al'Thor and Couladin of the Shaido Aiel declare themselves the messiah 'He Who Comes With the Dawn'. Rand reveals the secret history of the Aiel in the Age of Legends to prove his claim; whereupon an uproar breaks out among the Aiel, and, to avert violence, Rand uses the One Power to bring a rainstorm to the Aiel Waste. The Forsaken Asmodean uses the fighting between the Aiel as a distraction to seek out the ter'angreal access keys to the Choedan Kal, the most powerful sa'angreal ever created. Rand chases Asmodean to Rhuidean, where both grab the access key at the same time. The dramatic increase in power lets Rand sever Asmodean's link to the Dark One, marking Asmodean as a traitor to the rest of the Forsaken. Lanfear then limits Asmodean's access to the One Power and forces him to teach Rand to channel, which he agrees to as he has no other choice. When Rand returns to Al'cair Dal, he finds that most of the Aiel have acknowledged him as the Car'a'carn. =The Two Rivers= Padan Fain drives the Children of the Light to the Two Rivers in order to get revenge on Rand. Slayer, a mysterious and powerful agent of the Shadow, is sent to kill Fain with large numbers of Trollocs, which threaten the village as well. Perrin returns to find this conflict and discovers with horror that the Trollocs have killed his family. To fight the Trollocs, Perrin finds several new allies, including Verin Mathwin and Alanna Mosvani, Aes Sedai searching for potential pupils, and the Tinker Aram, who surprisingly abandons his people's pacifism to help. With the help of Tam al'Thor (Rand's adoptive father) and Abell Cauthon (Mat's father), Perrin teaches the people of the Two Rivers to fight. Perrin leads the Two Rivers against the Trollocs, and earns the nicknames 'Lord Perrin' and 'Perrin Goldeneyes' for his help. Before the final victory, Perrin marries Faile and then asks her to go to Caemlyn to ask Queen Morgase to send soldiers to help fight. The Children of the Light, led by Dain Bornhald, demand Perrin's arrest to try him for the murders of other whitecloaks previously, and Perrin agrees to give himself up, if the Children will help the Two Rivers when the Trollocs attack. Slayer is killing wolves in Tel'aran'rhiod, but he is attacked and defeated by Perrin, so he retreats. Without his leadership, the Trollocs are defeated by the Two Rivers forces. However, the Children of the Light didn't follow Perrin's agreement and did nothing during the attack, so Perrin and the townspeople force the Children to leave. With his plans ruined, Fain departs for the White Tower. =Tanchico in Tarabon= Nynaeve and Elayne, along with Thom Merrilin and Juilin Sandar, are taken to Tanchico by the Sea Folk, who are revealed to have their own set of prophecies about Rand. In Tanchico, they meet Bayle Domon and the Seanchan Egeanin and encounter Moghedien and the Black Ajah. They discover that the enemy's goal is a male a'dam, held in the private collection of the Panarch Amathera, which they plan to use to control Rand. Nynaeve and Elayne save Amathera from the Black Ajah and take the a'dam and a seal on the Dark One's prison from her palace. At this moment, Moghedien attacks them and personally duels Nynaeve, finding that they are roughly equal in power. Nynaeve defeats Moghedien and shields her, but the Black Ajah cause a distraction with a balefire-creating ter'angreal, letting Moghedien escape. Finally, they send Domon and Egeanin to destroy the a'dam. =White Tower= Min continues to report to the Amyrlin and tries to avoid suspicion by taking the guise of Elmindreda, a giddy, empty-headed woman. However, she finds herself caught in a coup: Elaida and her supporters depose Siuan and Leane Sharif, her Keeper of the Chronicles, for secretly aiding Rand. Siuan and Leane are both 'Stilled' (their ability to channel the One Power removed) and Elaida becomes the next Amyrlin. Min frees Siuan and Leane, and all three are assisted in escape by Gawyn Trakand. In departure, they acquire Logain Ablar, a former False Dragon who has been \\"Gentled\\" (the male equivalent of 'Stilling). After convincing Logain to help them, the four leave in search of safety.

CoGs are normally controlled by their member local governments, though some states have passed laws granting CoGs region-wide powers over specific functions, and still other states mandate such councils. Organization and function CoG members are drawn from the county, city, and other government bodies within its area. CoGs can offer planning, coordination, and technical assistance to their members, administer programs at a regional level, and act as intermediaries between the local government members and the state or federal government. A typical council is defined to serve an area of several counties, and addresses issues such as regional and municipal planning, economic, and community development, pollution control, transit administration, transportation planning, human services, and water use. Councils of governments also play a role in regional hazard mitigation and emergency planning and in the collection, analysis, distribution of demographic and cartographic/GIS data. Federal transportation planning CoGs may either be distinct from‚Äîor encompass‚Äîregional Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) and Rural Transportation Planning Organizations (RTPOs). MPOs are multi-governmental urban transportation planning entities that arose out of the requirements of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1962, which made federal financing for urban transportation projects contingent upon the existence of a \\"continuing, comprehensive, urban transportation planning process undertaken cooperatively by the states and local governments\\". RTPOs are bodies similar to, and inspired by the model of MPOs, but organized for rural areas. Though RTPOs existed for decades, they were only formally recognized by on a federal level by the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) of 2012. Of the 556 CoGs in the US, 165 operate an associated MPO, and 265 operate an associated RTPO. History Though voluntary non-profit regional organizations had existed for several decades before, CoGs in their modern form began in 1947, with the Atlanta Regional Metropolitan Planning Commission, followed by the Northern Virginia Regional Planning Commission in December of the same year. By 1950, there were 18 CoG/regional planning organizations in the US, and by 1953, the number of such bodies had increased on 40. CoGs saw explosive growth during the 1960s and 1970s, driven by federal and state funding incentives and mandates. At present, the National Association of Regional Councils estimates that currently \\"of the 39,000 local, general purpose governments in the United States (counties, cities, townships, towns, villages, boroughs) a total of more than 35,000 are served by [CoGs]\\".

The site is often known to archaeologists as Zakro or Kato Zakro. It is believed to have been one of the four main administrative centers of the Minoans, and its protected harbor and strategic location made it an important commercial hub for trade to the east. Flinders Petrie related Zakro with Tjeker of the Sea Peoples. Palace of Zakros ruins Libation vase from Zakros The town was dominated by the Palace of Zakro, originally built around 1900 BC, rebuilt around 1600 BC, and destroyed around 1450 BC along with the other major centers of Minoan civilization. Extensive ruins of the palace remain, and are a popular tourist destination. Geography Zakros is sometimes divided into Epano Zakros (Upper Zakros), the portion higher up on the hillside, and Kato Zakros (Lower Zakros), the part near the sea. A ravine known as the \\"Ravine of the Dead\\" runs through both the upper and lower parts of the ancient site, named after the numerous burials that have been found in the caves along its walls. Epano Zakros is from Sitia. The road passes through Palekastro where it doubles back towards the south. A comparatively large village, Zakros includes in its community the following smaller villages: Kato Zakros, Adravasti, Azokeramos, Kellaria, Klisidi and the small hamlets of Ayios Georgios, Sfaka, Kanava and Skalia. The asphalt road ends at Kato Zakros. Archaeology Zakro was first excavated by D.G. Hogarth of the British School of Archaeology at Athens and 12 houses were unearthed before the site was abandoned. In 1961, Nikolaos Platon resumed the excavation and discovered the Palace of Zakro. This site has yielded several clay tablets with Linear A inscriptions.Jan G. P.

She is best known as the subject of Leonardo da Vinci's painting The Lady with an Ermine (circa 1489). While posing for the painting, she invited Leonardo, who at the time was working as court artist for Sforza, to meetings at which Milanese intellectuals discussed philosophy and other subjects. Cecilia herself presided over these discussions. Drawing of Gallerani by Leonardo.  Family and early life  Cecilia was born into a large family from Siena. Her father's name was Fazio. He was not of nobility, but he occupied several posts at the Milanese court, including the position of ambassador to Florence and Lucca. Her mother was Margherita Busti, the daughter of a noted doctor of law. She was educated alongside her six brothers in Latin and literature. In 1483 at the age of ten, Cecilia was betrothed to Stefano Visconti, but the betrothal was broken off in 1487 for unknown reasons. In May 1489, she left home for the Monastero Nuovo, and it was possibly there where she met Ludovico.  Mistress of Ludovico Sforza  Cecilia spoke Latin fluently and was said to be a gifted musician and singer. She also wrote poetry. In about 1489, she sat for Ludovico's court artist and engineer, Leonardo da Vinci, who painted her celebrated portrait, which is known as The Lady with an Ermine. Isabella d'Este, an admirer of the work of Leonardo da Vinci, asked to borrow the portrait, but Cecilia replied it no longer looked like her because she had been so young then and \\"nobody seeing it and me together would suppose it was made for me\\".Gilbert, C. E. (1980). p 142 \\"Though reluctant because it no longer resembled her,(Beltrami, no 89) Cecilia complied, and by the following month the picture was gratefully returned\\".(L‚ÄôArte (1969). pp. 189-91.) Even after Ludovico married Beatrice d'Este, Cecilia continued to keep her apartments in Ludovico's castle. She had a son, Cesare, on 3 May 1491 by Ludovico Sforza. When Beatrice d'Este found out about their relationship, Ludovico was constrained to ask Cecilia to leave the Porta Giovia castle, the seat of the ducal court. She was first installed in the Verme Palace, and then given the Carmagnola Palace in 1492, when she married Count Ludovico Carminati de' Brambilla, known as \\"Il Bergamino\\". She bore her husband four children. After the death of both her husband and her son (1514‚Äì1515), she retired to San Giovanni in Croce, a castle near Cremona. Cesare, the son of Cecilia and Ludovico Sforza was made abbot of the Church of San Nazaro Maggiore of Milan in 1498; in 1505, he became canon of Milan. He died in 1512.  Death and legacy  Cecilia died on an unknown date in 1536. She was allegedly buried in the Carminati family tomb in the Church of San Zavedro. Bandello described her as a patron of the arts.

With 40 daily sailing races, up to 1,000 boats, and 8,000 competitors ranging from Olympic and world-class professionals to weekend sailors, it is the largest sailing regatta of its kind in the world. Having started in 1826, the event is held in August each year on the Solent (the area of water between southern England and the Isle of Wight made tricky by strong double tides), and is run by Cowes Week Limited in the small town of Cowes on the Isle of Wight. Description Cowes Week is held at the beginning of August, set after Glorious Goodwood in the social calendar, which in most years means from the first Saturday after the last Tuesday in July, until the following Saturday. It is occasionally moved to another week if the state of the tides in the normal week is unfavourable or, as in 2012, to avoid a clash with the Olympic Games. The regatta is famous for its fireworks on the final Friday. The display has taken place on the final Friday of the event since the early days and is an iconic finale. Typically Cowes Week up to forty starts a day for classes of cruiser-racers, one designs and keelboats; up to a thousand boats and 8,000 competitors take part. During this time the Solent, which is a busy commercial waterway, is filled with boats of all classes and is particularly colourful due to the spinnakers (the large rounded sail hoisted at the front of a yacht when running downwind). The different classes of boats are split into either White Group (dayboats) and Black Group (larger boats with cabins). As well as the sailing activities, the week includes a large number of onshore events including live music and cocktail parties. Marquees are erected in the marinas serving food and drink, and the crowds overflow from busy public houses and restaurants around the narrow high street - the town becomes a hive of activity into the early hours of each morning. Around 100,000 visitors are attracted to Cowes by the festival atmosphere of the event each year in addition to all the competitors.

Cowes Harbour in Race Week, 1990 History The Cowes Regatta as shown by J M W Turner 1827 The festival originates from the Prince Regent's interest in yachting which continued after he became George IV in 1820. The first race started at 09:30 on Thursday 10 August 1826 with the prize of a \\"Gold Cup of the value of ¬£100\\" and was held under the flag of the Royal Yacht Club, which later became the Royal Yacht Squadron. Another race was held the next day for prize money only (¬£30 for first place, ¬£20 for second). Until World War I, big cutters and raters were raced by gentlemen amateurs employing skippers and crew. In the 1920s and 1930s, there were cruiser handicap classes and local one-designs (although the six to eight and twelve metre classes attracted the most racing interest). Following World War II, when there was a revival of big yacht racing, ocean racing classes started to predominate, especially after the first Admiral's Cup event was held in 1957 and the growth in popularity of the two ocean-going races that start and finish the regatta The Channel and the Fastnet. The Fastnet, which rounds the Fastnet rock far out in the Atlantic and can be dangerous, is held in odd-numbered years only. In the decades following World War II, yachting moved away from its image as a rich man's sport to one which is enjoyed by many today in modest self-skippered 30 to 40 foot yachts. The attraction of Cowes Week has also given life to many water-based activities and sailing schools promoting the sport of sailing to all age groups and walks of life. Although certain functions in the week are still the preserve of the elite or members-only clubs, Cowes Week encompasses a wide range of events and attractions open to the public, marketed to a very diverse range of interests. Key shoreside events of Cowes Week include the festivities within Cowes Yacht Haven, on Cowes Parade and at Shepards Wharf Marina. Each of these venues offer entertainment for the general public as well as those racing. Traditionally at the end of the Cowes Week event, a fireworks display is held. This has occurred for more than 150 years. In recent years contributions to the funding of the display have been requested by the community who enjoy and benefit from them. In 2012 Mrs Gillian Smith became the first female Principal Race Officer to oversee the racing. Major trophies Cowes Moorings in Race Week, c1900 The Queen's Cup was presented to the Royal Southampton Yacht Club by Queen Victoria in 1897, her Diamond Jubilee year. Eleven boats entered the first Queen's Cup race on 9 August 1897. It was won by Latana, a 165-ton yawl owned by Mr W M Johnstone, by far the biggest boat in the race. The Cup was subsequently raced for on the opening day of Cowes Week but, shortly after the turn of the 20th century, it was mysteriously lost. Re-discovered in 1937 in a second-hand shop in Cardiff by a club member, Captain \\"Jonah\\" Jones, the Cup was bought back for the princely sum of ¬£35. The Queen's Cup has traditionally been awarded by the RSY. to the IRC Class 0 winner racing on the first Saturday of the event. In 1950, Sir Peter Scott suggested to King George VI that larger yachts should compete for a new trophy as it was felt that the America's Cup could not be restarted after the war. It was time for another competition of international significance to be introduced. King George was in favour and presented a trophy to the Royal Yachting Association, naming it The Britannia Cup. It certainly acted as a stimulus to big boat racing after the war. This competition also gave points towards the Admiral's Cup. The Britannia Cup was first won in 1951 by Taisser IV and Group Captain R J S Barton. The Britannia Cup is awarded to the winner of the class nominated by the Royal Yacht Squadron on the Tuesday of the event, this is usually IRC Class 0 or IRC Class 1. The New York Yacht Club Challenge Cup was presented by the New York Yacht Club in 1951 on 100th Anniversary of America's victory which led to the commencement of the America's Cup. It was presented to the Royal Yacht Squadron for races during Cowes Week Class 1. In 1957, with the advent of the Admiral's Cup, points won in this race counted towards the Admiral's Cup. In some ways the Admiral's Cup was an extension of the N.Y.Y.C. Cup in that Miles Wyatt and four friends presented this overall trophy to encourage overseas yachts to race at Cowes. Latifa, owned by Michael Mason, first won the Cup in 1951. The New York Yacht Club Challenge Cup is awarded to the winner of the class nominated by the Royal Yacht Squadron on the Wednesday of the event, this is usually IRC Class 0 or IRC Class 1. The Young Skipper's Trophy is awarded to the Skipper, aged under 25 on the Sunday immediately after the event, who achieves the best results over the course of the entire Week. The competition is open to young skippers across all classes. The Trophy was first presented by Skandia at the 1995 event and recognises the success of the yachtsmen and women of the future. The overall winner of Cowes Week is awarded with a special Scottish quaich Overall Winner Trophy The Overall Winner Trophy is awarded to the winner of either Black Group or White Group, determined by the overall winner on points. In art French painter Raoul Dufy has depicted the races and Royal Yacht Squadron in several works of the late 1920s and early '30s, the most famous one of which is now in the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. J.M.W. Turner also made a series of paintings, watercolours and pencil sketches of the regatta while visiting Cowes Castle in 1827.https://www.tate.org.uk/search?q=cowes+castle See also * Kiel Week * Royal Hobart Regatta * Barcolana regatta References External links *Official Lendy Cowes Week website *Directory website for Cowes Category:1826 establishments in England Category:Annual events in England Category:Annual sporting events in the United Kingdom Category:English traditions Category:Sport on the Isle of Wight Category:Sailing competitions in the United Kingdom Category:Sailing in England Category:Recurring sporting events established in 1826 Category:Yachting races Category:Sailing regattas Category:Cowes ","title":"Cowes Week"},{"id":"549714","text":"Quind√≠o () is a department of Colombia. It is in the western central region of the country, crossed by the Andes mountains. Its capital is Armenia. It is famous for the quality of the coffee plantations, colorful architecture, benign weather, variety of hotel accommodations and tourist landmarks. This department is located in a strategic area, in the center of the triangle formed by the three main cities of the country: Bogot√°, Medell√≠n and Cali. Quind√≠o is the second-smallest Colombian department (0.2% of the national territory) with 12 municipalities. Ethnographically and culturally it belongs to the Paisa region.  History  Before the Spanish invasion the entire area was inhabited by the peoples of the Quimbaya civilization until the 10th century B.C. At the time of Spanish conquest the area was inhabited by indigenous people of Carib descent known as the Pijao tribes. The native population was gradually reduced due to slavery, armed confrontations, and massacres during the Rubber boom, causing the territory to remain mostly uninhabited over the following centuries. At the present time, only a small population of nearly 2000 Amerindians remains in an indigenous reservation near La Tebaida. The first settlement to be founded in the area was Salento in 1842. In the 19th century northern peasants from Antioquia set out to settle in the area and their goal was to stay there permanently in a process known as Colonizaci√≥n antioque√±a (Antioquian Colonisation). Due to the inaccessibility of the territory and the lack of roads, trade and communications were made through mule caravans (arrier√≠a) or by porters such as the silleros. In 1905, the old Department of Antioquia was partitioned into two, giving rise to the new Department of Caldas, which at the time included the modern department of Risaralda. In 1908 the territory, then in jurisdiction of the Cauca Department, was annexed to Caldas department. Other relevant events in the history of the Quind√≠o department are: *1942: The opening of the first beer factory (BAVARIA) *1947: The opening of the first coffee roaster industry (Caf√© Luz) *1954: The most successful coffee harvest in the history of the country (‚Äúbonanza cafetera‚Äù) *1964: Opening of the Metalmechanic Industries of Quind√≠o *1964: The Regional Autonomous Corporation is created to protect the local environment *1965: Opening of the Soft drinks factory Gaseosas Regional (with production of pineapple, kola and chocolate flavored pop sodas) *1966: The pyramidal cathedral to the Immaculate Conception with post-modern architecture is built. *1967: Ivan Botero Gomez enterprise starts operations also see list of Governors of the Department of Quind√≠o.

Geography  La Vieja River Most of its surface is occupied for the western face of the Cordillera Central. Highest mountain: (Nevado del Quind√≠o) high. The lowest area is the valley of La Vieja River, high. This department consists entirely of mountain landscapes covered in tropical rainforest and Guadua bamboo forests. The ground is enriched with ancient volcanic eruptions, raising its fertility. There are also many rivers and streams, including the Quind√≠o River which rises in the Cocora Valley. The weather varies widely, having two rainy seasons (April and November) separated by two dry seasons. The annual precipitation is around and comes from the humidity of winds from the Pacific Ocean being cooled as they rise over the Andes. The average temperature is between in the La Vieja river valley and in Salento.  Quind√≠o wax palm tree  Quind√≠o wax palm tree is the national tree of Colombia With law 61 of 1985, the Colombian Congress adopted the Quind√≠o wax palm tree, Ceroxylon quindiuense, a local endangered species adapted to high altitudes, as the National Tree. As ratified on September 16, 1985, by the then president of Colombia, Belisario Betancur, the law states: \\"The species commonly known as the Quind√≠o wax palm tree, scientific name Ceroxylon quindiuense, is declared the national tree and symbol of our fatherland. The national government is empowered to buy as much land as needed to create wildlife sanctuaries with the purpose of preserving this national symbol and its natural environment. It is forbidden to cut down the Quind√≠o wax palm tree. The punishment for doing so shall be a fine and a term in jail\\".\\" The Quind√≠o wax palm tree was nearly driven to extinction by the extraction of the resinous substance that it exudes. Furthermore, its leaves were widely used for the celebration of Holy Week processions, especially that of Palm Sunday.  Economy  Quind√≠o's economy is based mainly in the harvest of coffee. It is one of the most important producers of Colombian coffee. The department belongs to the Colombian Coffee-Growers Axis which is the center of production and export of the highest quality coffee in Colombia. plantain, cassava, Salentune potato and sugarcane are also cultivated, mostly for sale in the local markets.

In the picture, Cafe Cortado Some of the typical food and drinks are: * Salentune Patac√≥n, which is made with plantain, smashed in a thin layer, fried and covered with grounded cheese and pineapple sauce * Quindian arepa filled with shredded chicken and pieces of pig chicharr√≥n * Cocora, which is a baked trout * Maduro, which is a broiled plantain filled with cheese and Bocadillo (thick guava jam) * Roasted gurre * Guatin stew * Coffee wine (obtained from fermentation of coffee berries) with flavor similar to coffee liqueur * Coffee arequipe * Corn chicha fermented in a large pottery recipient containing a horseshoe to enhance the flavor * Carajillo, a typical cocktail made of one part of hot coffee, one part of sugarcane aguardiente and cinnamon sticks =Festivals and celebrations= Quind√≠o department is the main exponent of traditional Cultura Cafetera (coffee culture) in the country. There are several events all around the year that attracts a large number of visitors to this region. With the purpose of preserving this cultural expression, the regional government promotes the declaration of Patrimony of Humanity by the UNESCO. Among other events: Paper lanterns in Quimbaya, Quind√≠o candlelight festival *The National Coffee Party is the main event of the department. It is celebrated each year since 1960 in Calarc√°, the last days of June. The event includes the national beauty contest of coffee. *The international fair of handcrafts, each may in Armenia. *The day of St. Isidro (July-all the municipalities). *The National festival of kites (August- La Tebaida). *The anniversary of Armenia (October), with the Yipao or jeep parade. *The candlelight festival of Quimbaya (December) . *The Bullfighting season of La Macarena (January- Armenia). =The Quimbayan Christmas Panther= The Quimbayan Christmas Panther is an indigenous & sacred animal recognized by indigenous and mestizo communities in the Quind√≠o Department of Colombia. Belief in the Christmas Panther (el puma de navidad) has developed throughout the history of the Quimbayan holiday known as the Alumbrado de Navidad (see Feast of the Immaculate Conception), celebrated on the 7th of December in recognition of the Roman Catholic belief in the Immaculate Conception of Christ. It is believed that the significance of the puma stems from the arrival of ethnically Spanish colonialists from Antioquia in the region during the 1850s. The colonialist's Catholic traditions of using candlelight to celebrate the Immaculate Conception was combined with belief of the local Quimbaya tribe in the effect that fire (luces de fogota) had in protecting against panther attacks as pumas and other local fauna are believed to fear fire. Thus, in an instance of religious syncretism, the Alumbrado de Navidad and the symbolism of the puma to native peoples were linked. It is still a common practice to display the symbol of the panther (in the form of sculptures made of terra cotta, cloth, plastic, etc.) in conjunction with the lighting of candles on the night of December the 7th. Such religious syncretism is especially visible in the rural pueblos of Quind√≠o where many residents claim full or partial descent from Quimbaya native peoples of the region.(the Quimbayan christmas panther is blue with yellow tail).  Fauna and Flora  Odontoglossum cruentum Quind√≠o is the natural habitat of 520 species of birds and about 60 species of mammals. Many of them are endemisms. The area has the largest number of heliconia species in the world and a large numbers of species of orchids, mainly of the genera cattleya, odontoglossum, miltonia, phragmipedium and peristeria. The natural forests typical of the area, such as the p√°ramo, and the cloud forest, are decreasing progressively due to agricultural activities. As a result, many of the endemic species are threatened, endangered or critically endangered. Some of them are: * Yellow-eared parrot * Andean guan * Colombian weasel * Epicrionops columbianus caecilian * Mano de oso tree.

History Before the European conquest the territory was inhabited by the Quimbaya and Caramanta people. The first conquistadores arrived in the 1537 expedition headed by Sebasti√°n de Belalc√°zar. Some Spanish towns were founded, but the decline of the indigenous population and low immigration of Europeans led to Risaralda sitting largely abandoned until the mid-nineteenth century, when coffee cultivation arrived. During the colonial and early years of the Republic, the region was subject to Popay√°n Province. In 1821 it became part of the Cauca Department. In 1857 it became part of the Federal State of Cauca. In 1905, Risaralda was attached to the Caldas Department. In 1966 it was created as a separate department with its capital in Pereira.

It consists of two island groups in the Caribbean Sea about northwest of mainland Colombia, and eight outlying banks and reefs. The largest island of the archipelago is called San Andr√©s and its capital is San Andr√©s. The other large islands are Providencia and Santa Catalina Islands which lie to the north-east of San Andr√©s; their capital is Santa Isabel. Name The name is sometimes abbreviated to \\"Archip. de San Andres\\". The official website abbreviates it as San Andr√©s (\\"Gobernaci√≥n de San Andr√©s\\"). ISO 3166-2:CO lists it as \\"San Andr√©s, Providencia y Santa Catalina\\". Statoids lists it as \\"San Andr√©s y Providencia\\". History Spain formally claimed the archipelago of San Andres and Providencia in 1510, a few years after the voyages of Christopher Columbus. In 1544, the territory was placed under the administration of the Captaincy General of Guatemala. During the early years, Spain concentrated on exploring and colonizing the mainland and hardly settled the islands. In 1630, English Puritans arrived in Providence Island, under the aegis of the Providence Island Company. The Puritans decide to settle the tropical islands, rather than cold, rocky New England, but the Providence Island colony did not succeed in the same way as the Massachusetts Bay Colony. They established slave-worked plantations and engaged in privateering, which led to the Spanish and Portuguese conquering the colony in May, 1641.Providence Island, 1630‚Äì1641, The Other Puritan Colony - by Karen Ordahl Kupperman, University of Connecticut In 1670, English buccaneers, led by Henry Morgan, took over the islands, which he used as a base to attack Panama. The buccaneers abandoned the islands by 1672. There is no record of anyone inhabiting the islands from then for another century. In 1775, Lieutenant Tom√°s O'Neil, a Spaniard of Irish descent, was given military command of the islands and, in 1790, was named governor. He requested the transfer of the islands to the jurisdiction of the Viceroyalty of New Granada, which was granted in 1803. That year, Spain assigned the islands, together with the province of Veraguas (western Panama and the east coast of Nicaragua), to the Viceroyalty of New Granada. The territory was administered from the province of Cartagena. Soon, trade links with Cartagena were greater than those with Guatemala. On 4 July 1818, a French corsair, Louis-Michel Aury, with 400 men and 14 ships flying the Argentine flag, captured Old Providence and St. Catherine islands. The island was populated by white English-speaking Protestants and their slaves. Aury and his team used the islands as their new base from which to pursue Central American independence. However, his efforts to also support Bolivar in his fight for Venezuelan and Colombian independence were repeatedly turned down. After the Spanish colonies became independent, the inhabitants of San Andr√©s, Providence and St. Catherine voluntarily adhered to the Republic of Gran Colombia in 1822, which placed them under the administration of the Magdalena Department. The First Mexican Empire, which was succeeded by the United Provinces of Central America (UPCA), also claimed the islands. Gran Colombia, in turn, protested the UPCA's occupation of the eastern coast of Nicaragua. The UPCA broke up in 1838 to 1840, but Nicaragua carried on the dispute, as did Gran Colombia's successors: New Granada and Colombia. A local administration (intendencia) was established in the islands in 1912 by Columbia. In 1928, Colombia and Nicaragua signed the Esguerra- B√°rcenas Treaty, which gave control of the islands to Colombia. However, when the Sandinista government assumed power in the 1980s, Nicaragua repudiated the treaty. Colombia argues that the treaty's final ratification in 1930 (when the US forces were already on their way out) confirms its validity. Colombia and Honduras signed a maritime boundary treaty in 1999, which implicitly accepts Colombian sovereignty over the islands. In 2001, Nicaragua filed claims with the International Court of Justice (ICJ) over the disputed maritime boundary and claimed in the Caribbean, including the San Andr√©s and Providencia Archipelagoes. Colombia responded that the court has no jurisdiction over the matter and increased its naval and police presence in the islands. Colombia also defended its claim in the ICJ. On 13 December 2007, the ICJ ruled that the islands were Colombian territory but left the maritime border dispute unresolved. On 19 November 2012, the ICJ held that Colombia had sovereignty over the islands. = United States claims = In the 19th century, the United States claimed several uninhabited locations in the area under the Guano Island Act, including several now claimed by Colombia. In 1981, the US ceded its claims to Serrana Bank and Roncador Bank to Colombia and abandoned its claim to Quita Sue√±o Bank. The US still maintains claims over Serranilla Bank and Bajo Nuevo Bank and considers them both to be unincorporated territories of the United States. = Declaration of self-determination = In 1903, the local Raizal population rejected an offer from the US to separate from Colombia in the wake of Panama's secession from Colombia. However, the island's native population soon changed its mind when the policies of successive Colombian governments tried consistently to modify the majority Raizal and British ethnic composition of the Islands by the extensive migration of Spanish-speaking mainland Colombians. The efforts at assimilation and immigration were led largely by Catholic missionaries, which angered the Protestant native population.  Local government and representation  = 2007 elections = A member of the departmental assembly for 15 years, Pedro Gallardo Forbes, of the Regional Integration Movement (MIR), won the 28 October 2007 gubernatorial election, with support from the Colombian Conservative Party and the Radical Change party. He succeeded a governor from the Colombian Liberal Party. He got 8,187 votes (38.93%), Aury Guerrero Bowie (Liberal Party, with support from the Democratic Colombia Party) 8,160 votes (38.8%), and Jack Housni Jaller (Social National Unity Party) 4,063 votes (19.3%). Only 21,991 out of 41,197 potential electors voted in the gubernatorial election. At the departmental assembly, elected the same day, the 9 seats were distributed among 6 parties: three Liberals (Arlington Howard, Qwincy Bowie Gordon, and Leroy Carol Bent Archbold), two MIR (Jorge M√©ndez and Freddy Herazo) two Democratic Colombia Party (former MP Mar√≠a Teresa Uribe Bent and former Interior Secretary Rafael G√≥mez Redondo), two SNUP (Fernando Ca√±on Florez and Mar√≠a Said Darwich), one Radical Change (Heber Esquivel Benitez), and one Conservative (Julio C√©sar Gallardo Mart√≠nez). The new mayor of Providence, Janeth Archbold (Team Colombia party), a political ally of the new governor, was elected with 1,013 votes against Liberal Mark Taylor (515 votes), SNUP Arturo Robinson (514 votes) and Conservative Peter Bent.  Geography  Besides the San Andr√©s and Providencia island groups, there are eight atolls that belong to the Department, including submerged Alice Shoal. = Island of San Andr√©s =  San Andr√©s Island  San Andr√©s Island montage Cangrejo Cay This is the main island of the San Andr√©s group, and the largest of the Department. It is located at . It measures in length with a width of and covers an area of . There is a tiny lagoon in the centre of the island called Big Pond. The principal town is San Andr√©s in the north of the island. Another town is San Luis on the east coast. Cayo Johnny (Johnny Caye) lies ENE of German Point (Punta Norte), the island's northern tip, and Haynes Cay about the same distance east of the island. Cotton Cay is less than south of San Andr√©s town, on the northeastern coast.  Cayos de Albuquerque (Cayos de S.W., Southwest Cays)  This atoll is southwest of San Andr√©s at . It is the westernmost point of Colombia. The reef is about across. In the southern part are Cayo del Norte and Cayo del Sur. Cayo del Norte, the larger of the two, is up to high and overgrown with palm trees and bushes. Cayo del Sur, a few hundred metres further South, reaches a height of a little more than and is vegetated with a few bushes, and in the South with mangroves. There is a lighthouse on Cayo del Norte, at , operating since 1980. It is maintained by the Colombian Navy.  Cayos del Este Sudeste (Courtown Cays, Cayos de E.S.E.)  Cities of San Andr√©s and Providencia This atoll is east-south-east of San Andr√©s Island and northeast of Cayos de Alburquerque, at . It is long and wide. There are a few sand cays in the southeast. The largest ones are Cayo del Este, Cayo Bolivar, West Cay, and Cayo Arena, none of which are higher than . All cays are overgrown with palm trees and bushes, and surrounded by mangroves. There is a Colombian Navy lighthouse on Cayo Bolivar. The cays are regularly visited by fishermen from the Colombian mainland and San Andr√©s. There are two concrete buildings on Cayo Bolivar, and a few wooden huts on the other cays.  Banks and Shoals  Colombia claims sovereignty over six additional outlying banks and shoals: Alice Shoal, Bajo Nuevo Bank, Serranilla Bank, Quita Sue√±o Bank, Serrana Bank, and Roncador Bank.  Demographics  The Departamento de San Andr√©s, Providencia y Santa Catalina covers a land area of and had a Census population of 59,573. The latest official estimate for 2007 is 72,923. Before 1960, the population of the islands was almost entirely Raizals, who are an Afro-Caribbean group, Protestant in religion, speaking San Andr√©s-Providencia Creole. There is a minority of white English-speaking Protestants of British descent. Colombia has promoted the migration of Spanish-speaking mainlanders, with Catholic missions participating since 1947. This policy seems to be an answer to growing discontent within the Raizal community that could strengthen separatist movements; a raizal majority would in this case win a pro- independence referendum but this could be neutralized by outnumbering them with mainland Colombians. By 2005, Raizals were only 30% of the 60,000 or more inhabitants of the islands, with the rest being mainland Colombians and English-speaking whites of British descent. Raizals can speak both Spanish and English. Transportation =Airports= The airport serves the towns of San Andr√©s and San Luis, but also commercially serves the nearby island of Providencia Island, all being major tourist and vacation spots for South and Central American tourists. Gustavo Rojas Pinilla International Airport is also known as Sesquicentenario International Airport. The airport is the 6th busiest airport in Colombia in terms of passengers, with 836,234 in 2006. Most of these passengers come from the continental part of the country, due to poor international direct service to the island. Many international tourists have to fly to one of Colombia's or Panama's largest airports (Bogot√°, Medell√≠n, Cali, Cartagena, Panama City) to be able to reach the islands. In recent years San Andr√©s has started to receive seasonal charter flights, mainly from Canada and a few Central American countries. The airport is one of Colombia's fastest growing airports with a 13.4% increase in the number of passengers between 2005 and 2006.

It describes the strength of the Faraday effect for a particular material. For a constant magnetic field parallel to the path of the light, it can be calculated by: :\\\\theta=V B L Where \\\\theta is the angle between the starting and ending polarizations, V is the Verdet constant, B is the strength of the magnetic field, and L is the path length in the material. The Verdet constant of a material is wavelength dependent and for most materials is extremely small. It is strongest in substances containing paramagnetic ions such as terbium. The highest Verdet constants in bulk media are found in terbium doped dense flint glasses or in crystals of terbium gallium garnet (TGG). These materials have excellent transparency properties and high damage thresholds for laser radiation. Atomic vapours, however, can have Verdet constants which are orders of magnitude larger than TGG, but only over a very narrow wavelength range. Alkali vapours can therefore be used as an optical isolator, as demonstrated in Durham University's Atomic and Molecular Physics research group. The Faraday effect is chromatic (i.e. it depends on wavelength) and therefore the Verdet constant is quite a strong function of wavelength. At 632.8 nm, the Verdet constant for TGG is reported to be , whereas at 1064 nm it falls to .http://www.northropgrumman.com/BusinessVentures/SYNOPTICS/Products/SpecialtyCrystals/Documents/pageDocs/TGG.pdf This behavior means that the devices manufactured with a certain degree of rotation at one wavelength, will produce much less rotation at longer wavelengths. Many Faraday rotators and isolators are adjustable by varying the degree to which the active TGG rod is inserted into the magnetic field of the device. In this way, the device can be tuned for use with a range of lasers within the design range of the device. Truly broadband sources (such as ultrashort-pulse lasers and the tunable vibronic lasers) will not see the same rotation across the whole wavelength band.

It was published in 1976 and details the events of a year described by Vidal as \\"probably the low point in our republic's history\\". Style The novel is written in the form of a journal written by Charles Schermerhorn Schuyler. Plot The novel follows Charles Schermerhorn Schuyler who has recently returned to the United States after more than 30 years in Europe, where he married into minor Napoleonic nobility; he is accompanied by his beautiful, young, widowed daughter Emma, the Princesse d'Agrigente. She immediately becomes the darling of New York high society. Despite his fame and affluent image, Schuyler finds work as a journalist because his wealth has been destroyed by the Panic of 1873 and his daughter's late husband has left her penniless. Schuyler also supports the Democratic candidate, Samuel J. Tilden, Governor of New York, because he hopes to secure himself a diplomatic position with the incoming administration, enabling him to return to Europe. The early chapters detail the Schuylers' introduction into New York society and the engagement between Emma and John Day Apgar, a wealthy but rather dull young lawyer and scion of a leading New York family. The later chapters chronicle Schuyler's sojourn in Washington, DC and Emma's growing friendship with the wealthy Denise Sanford and her boorish husband William. Emma and Denise become close friends, but after Denise dies in childbirth, Emma breaks off her engagement to Apgar and marries Sanford instead.Susan Baker & Curtis S. Gibson, Gore Vidal: a critical companion (Greenwood Press, Westport, CT, 1997), p.106 The political backdrop to the story is the 1876 presidential election, a close contest between Tilden and the Republican Rutherford B. Hayes. Tilden won the popular vote, but there was a dispute over the results in Louisiana, Oregon, South Carolina, and Florida. In Florida, the Republican leaders of the State and the Electoral Commission initially reported a victory for Tilden, before deciding that in fact Hayes had won. Vidal builds up to this historic crisis through the activities of a mixed cast of historical and fictional characters, some of the latter having appeared in Burr or having descended from characters in that novel.

History  The Abingtons Though often listed as a single entity, Great and Little Abington have since early medieval times been two parishes divided by the River Granta and remain so. The southernmost of the two, Great Abington, covers and is bounded to the south by the county border with Essex, to the west by a branch of the Icknield Way (now the A11), and to the east by the parish of Hildersham. Little Abington covers , again bordered by the Icknield Way and Hildersham to the west and east, and by the ancient thoroughfare of Wool Street to the north. The village history dates back to the Bronze Age, some 4000 years ago. The Saxons gave the village its name, originally called \\"estate named after Abba\\", and the village was listed as Abintone in the Domesday Book. The 'Great' and 'Little' prefixes came later: the Latin magna is observed from 1218 and the Modern English great from 1523 while the Latin parva is observed from 1218 and the Middle English littel from 1336. In the decades before the Second World War the Land Settlement Association created a site to the south of Great Abington consisting of over sixty houses and plots of land for unemployed miners mainly from the former shipyards of Tyneside and coalfields of Yorkshire and Durham. The Cambridge to Haverhill railway line that opened in 1865 crossed Great Abington just south of the village, but closed in 1967. The medieval Cambridge to Colchester road that was the main route through the village was by-passed in the 1960s. Churches Great Abington's parish church has been dedicated to St Mary since at least the 16th century and comprises a chancel, nave with south aisle and porch, and west tower. The majority of the present building dates from the 13th century, possibly earlier, including the two-storey tower with short leaded spire. Little Abington's parish church is also dedicated to St Mary, and has been since at least the 16th century. The present building consists of a chancel, nave with north chapel and south porch, and west tower. The nave is believed to date from around 1100, and the chancel was rebuilt in the 13th century. The three-storey tower is probably 14th century. A Protestant chapel was built in Little Abington towards the end of the 19th century. It closed in late 2019 and the land has now been sold. Demolition of the chapel has been confirmed. Village life Great Abington The village has a vibrant community with a primary school, village shop, pub, football and cricket team and a large number of local businesses, most of them at Granta Park including The Welding Institute which started in Abington Hall in 1946. In 2009 Abington cricket club played a friendly against Babraham cricket club to commemorate 150 years of the cricket team. The village also has a village hall, called The Abington Institute, which has a caf√©, a large main hall with video projection and an audio system allowing the showing of films and presentations. It also has a meeting room, another large room overlooking the cricket pitch and two changing rooms with showers. The Institute is used by many local clubs and organisations and also hosts regular lunches for older Abington residents. The remaining public house, The Three Tuns in Great Abington, is a 17th-century building that was possibly open in 1687 and certainly by 1756. Former pubs in Little Abington include The Crown which closed in the late 20th century, and The Bricklayers' Arms, which opened in the mid-19th century and was sold in 1912. The Princess (later Prince) of Wales in Great Abington opened at the end of the 19th century and closed in about 1963. The King's Arms opened on the Stump Cross to Newmarket road (now the A11) just north of Bourn Bridge in the late 17th century, closing in 1850 with the advent of the railway. The antiquary William Cole was born there while his father was publican. The White Hart opened on the same road just south of the bridge in around 1750, but closed by the end of the century.

The disorder presents in the early neonatal period with poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, and lack of muscle tone. Without treatment, death can occur quickly, due to secondary hyperammonemia, infection, cardiomyopathy, or brain damage. Symptoms and signs Propionic acidemia is characterized almost immediately in newborns. Symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, dehydration, acidosis, low muscle tone (hypotonia), seizures, and lethargy. The effects of propionic acidemia quickly become life-threatening. Long-term complications can include chronic kidney disease, cardiomyopathy, and prolonged QTc interval. Pathophysiology Methylmalonic acidemia is caused by a defect in the vitamin B12-dependent enzyme methylmalonyl CoA mutase. Propionic acidemia has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. In healthy individuals, enzyme propionyl-CoA carboxylase converts propionyl-CoA to methylmalonyl-CoA. This is one of many steps in the process of converting certain amino acids and fats into energy. Individuals with Propionic acidemia cannot perform this conversion because the enzyme propionyl-CoA carboxylase is nonfunctional. The essential amino acids valine, methionine, isoleucine, and threonine can not be converted and this leads to a buildup of propionyl-CoA. Instead of being converted to methylmalonyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA is then converted into propionic acid, which builds up in the bloodstream. This in turn causes an accumulation of dangerous acids and toxins, which can cause damage to the organs. In many cases, propionic acidemia can damage the brain, heart, kidney, liver, cause seizures and delays to normal development such as walking or talking. The patient may need to be hospitalized to prevent breakdown of proteins within the body. Dietary needs must be closely managed. Mutations in both copies of the PCCA or PCCB genes cause propionic acidemia.http://mayoresearch.mayo.edu/mayo/research/barry_lab/ropionic- Aciademia.cfm Barry Lab - Vector and Virus Engineering. Gene therapy for Propionic Acidemia These genes contain instructions to form alpha- and beta-subunits of PCC, the enzyme called propionyl-CoA carboxylase. PCC is required for the normal breakdown of the essential amino acids valine, isoleucine, threonine, and methionine, as well as certain odd-chained fatty-acids. Mutations in the PCCA or PCCB genes disrupt the function of the enzyme, preventing these acids from being metabolized. As a result, propionyl-CoA, propionic acid, ketones, ammonia, and other toxic compounds accumulate in the blood, causing the signs and symptoms of propionic acidemia. Diagnosis Elevated metabolites of propionic acid (for example, 3-hydroxypropionate, methylcitrate, tiglylglycine, propionylglycine) found in blood and urine along with normal biotinidase levels. Management Patients with propionic acidemia should be started as early as possible on a low protein diet. In addition to a protein mixture that is devoid of methionine, threonine, valine, and isoleucine, the patient should also receive L-carnitine treatment and should be given antibiotics 10 days per month in order to remove the intestinal propiogenic flora. The patient should have diet protocols prepared for him with a ‚Äúwell day diet‚Äù with low protein content, a ‚Äúhalf emergency diet‚Äù containing half of the protein requirements, and an ‚Äúemergency diet‚Äù with no protein content. These patients are under the risk of severe hyperammonemia during infections that can lead to comatose states.Saudubray JM, Van Der Bergh G, Walter J : Inborn Metabolic Diseases Diagnosis and Treatment (2012) Liver transplant is gaining a role in the management of these patients, with small series showing improved quality of life. Epidemiology Propionic acidemia is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and is found in about 1 in 35,000 live births in the United States. The condition appears to be more common in Saudi Arabia, with a frequency of about 1 in 3,000. The condition also appears to be common in Amish, Mennonite and other populations with higher frequency of consanguinuity.  History In 1957, a male child was born with poor mental development, repeated attacks of acidosis, and high levels of ketones and glycine in the blood. Upon dietary testing, Dr. Barton Childs discovered that his symptoms worsened when given the amino acids leucine, isoleucine, valine, methionine, and threonine. In 1961, the medical team at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland published the case, calling the disorder ketotic hyperglycinemia. In 1969, using data from the original patient's sister, scientists established that propionic acidemia was a recessive disorder, and that propionic acidemia and methylmalonic acidemia are caused by deficiencies in the same enzyme pathway.

Almost nothing is known about him and he does not appear in any contemporary records. Tradition dating to the late 18th century made him a son of Olaf the Black who was King of Man (r. 1225‚Äì1237). Heraldic evidence, dating to the late 17th century, is considered to be the earliest evidence of descent from Olaf the Black. However, in recent years, this traditional lineage has been challenged and is no longer considered fact by one historian. see \\"!CAVEAT\\". According to Clan MacLeod tradition, Leod inherited some of his lands from a foster father, who was a sheriff of the Hebridean island of Skye; other lands he inherited from his father-in-law, who was also a lord on Skye. MacLeod tradition also states that Leod was the father of four sons and two daughters. Two of these sons founded the two main branches of MacLeods; branches which exist to this day‚ÄîTormod (from whom the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan descend) and Torquil (from whom the MacLeods of Lewis descend). The traditional belief that Torquil was a son has also been challenged; the current understanding is that he was a great-grandson of Leod. In recent years, the DNA evidence of men bearing surnames equating to MacLeod has revealed that a certain proportion share a common ancestor‚Äîan ancestor considered to have been the clan's founder. Traditional ancestry The coat of arms of the MacLeods of Harris, recorded in a mid 15th century armorial. arms of MacLeod of MacLeod. According to MacLeod tradition, Leod is the eponymous ancestor of the clan. However, little to nothing is known about this man; he does not appear in any contemporary records. The earliest historical record of a MacLeod chief occurs almost a century after he is thought to have flourished‚Äîwhen the names of \\"Malcolme, son to Tormode M'Cloyde\\", and that of \\"Torkyll M'Cloyd\\", appear in a royal charter during the reign of David II, King of Scots (r. 1329‚Äì1371). Until quite recently, Leod has generally been considered to have been the son of Olaf the Black, King of Mann and the Isles (r. 1225‚Äì1237). This traditional ancestry may be traced to the late 17th century when a chief adopted the designation of \\"McOlaus\\" and another was the first MacLeod to incorporate the royal Manx arms into MacLeod heraldry. In a document dating to 1630, Iain M√≤r MacLeod of Dunvegan (chief 1626‚Äì1649) appears as \\"John McOlaus of Dunvegane\\"‚ÄîMcOlaus representing MacOlaf. This chief's son, Iain Breac (chief 1664‚Äì1693), is the first MacLeod to have incorporated the Manx triskelion into his coat of arms. The triskelion was borne in the arms of the kings of Mann and the Isles as far back as the 13th century. The earliest known arms borne by the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan (pictured top-right) are, however, quite different the royal Manx arms. These earliest MacLeod arms date to the mid 15th century; recorded in a leading European armorial known as the Armorial de Berry. Accordingly, it has been suggested that these points show that 17th century belief of a descent from Olaf was not one of long standing. This webpage cited: There are various other points which cast serious doubt on Leod's traditional ancestry. In 1265, Magnus, King of Mann, the last king of this Manx dynasty died. Later in 1275, Magnus's illegitimate son, Godfrey died while leading a revolt. At least two women later came forward with claims for the kingdom‚Äîyet Leod and his sons did not. According to W.D.H. Sellar, it is hard to believe that a descendant of the royal line would not have put forward a claim. Another point put forward is that the MacLeods did not adopt the royal names of the 13th century Manx dynasty‚Äînames such as Godfrey (Old Norse: Gu√∞r√∏√∞r; Gaelic: Gofraid), Ranald (Old Norse R√∂gnvaldr; Gaelic: Raghnall), Olaf (Old Norse √ìl√°fr; Gaelic Amla√≠b), and Harald (Old Norse Haraldr; Gaelic Aralt). Sellar illustrated his point by noting the royal names adopted by the descendants of Somerled (d.1164) and his wife Ragnhild, daughter of Olaf the Red (grandfather of Olaf the Black). In the 17th century, George Mackenzie, 1st Earl of Cromartie wrote a history of the Mackenzies, which included a genealogy of the MacLeods of Lewis (from whom he was also descended). Cromartie's genealogy listed Leod as a son of Harald, son of Godred Donn. Later genealogies, however, made Leod a son of Olaf the Black‚Äîgenealogies found in Sir Robert Douglas of Glenbervie's Baronage of Scotland, of 1798; and the Bannatyne manuscript, which dates to about 1830. This webpage cited: In the Baronage of Scotland, Glenbervie stated that he had obtained information from the MacLeods of Dunvegan which was allegedly based upon information found within the mediaeval Chronicles of Mann and William Camden's 17th century Britannia‚Äîhowever, neither of these two works make any mention of Leod at all. In 1977, historian William Matheson rejected the traditional descent from Olaf the Black on the basis that it is unsupported by any facts whatsoever, and that it is also contradicted by earlier Gaelic-language genealogies which may be more authentic. =Traditional genealogies reconsidered= pedigrees concerning the ancestry of Leod (click to enlarge). In recent years, several historians have noted that within the Gaelic-language genealogies and praise-poetry concerning the MacLeods, Leod's great-grandfather's name appears to equate to the Old Norse √ñlvir, Olv√©r; rather than the Old Norse √ìl√°fr. This webpage cited: ; and also ; see also There are considered to be four significant Gaelic-language genealogies which concern Leod's ancestry. These pedigree roughly agree with one another in the three generations after Leod. The greatest similarity between these genealogies are the names of Leod's great-grandfather, variously spelt Oilmoir, Olbair Snaige, Olbuir Snaithe, and Olbair Snoice. Taking into account variances in spelling, these names are now considered to represent the literary Gaelic Olbhar, and the vernacular Gaelic Olghair; both which are in turn forms of √ñlvir. Matheson proposed that when Camden published his Britannia which included an account of the kings of Mann, genealogists saw the Latin Olavus (a Latin form of the Old Norse √ìl√°fr) and concluded that it represented the Gaelic name Olbhar, Olghair. However, the Scottish Gaelic form of Olaf, Olavus, Olaus, √ìl√°fr, is in fact Amhlaoibh, and the more modern Amhlaidh. Matheson further proposed that Leod's father's name also equates to √ñlvir. So in Matheson's opinion, genealogists mistakenly attached Leod's father and great-grandfather to the Manx king Olaf the Black and his own grandfather, Olaf the Red. While Matheson's identification of the name of Leod's grandfather is now accepted, Sellar later disagreed with him on the name of Leod's father; proposing instead that it was more likely the Gaelic name Gillemuire‚Äîa name which appears on one of the four Gaelic-language genealogies. This webpage cited: The ancestry and some of the relatives of Olvir Rosta, according to the Orkneyinga saga. Leod's name is represented in Scottish Gaelic as Le√≤d. This name is a Gaelic form of the Old Norse Lj√≥tr, meaning \\"ugly\\". Matheson stated that this Norse name was rare in both Scandinavia and Iceland. He noted that in Scotland it was peculiar to the MacLeods, though it is almost never used within the clan. Matheson speculated that Leod's great-grandfather would have likely flourished at about the same time as Olvir Rosta was supposedly exiled to the Outer Hebrides. Matheson went even further and proposed that Leod's great-grandfather was in fact Olvir Rosta‚Äîa character from the mediaeval Orkneyinga saga. Matheson noted that while the name Lj√≥tr is rare, Olvir Rosta's maternal grandfather appears in the saga as Lj√≥tr n√≠√∞ingr ('Lj√≥tr Villain'). In Matheson's opinion, since the Gaelic-language genealogies are inconsistent in the generations further back than Leod's great-grandfather, this may show that the man was a newcomer in the area. Sellar, however, rejected Matheson's proposal, commenting that such evidence was entirely circumstantial. Sellar stated that Olvir was not such a rare name; also, Olvir Rosta's genealogy and family within the saga (see above right) has no similarity with that recorded in the Gaelic-language genealogies relevant to Leod. In contrast to Matheson's opinion about the name Lj√≥tr, the 20th-century historian A. Morrison was of the opinion that the name may not be as rare as some people have thought. Morrison noted that the 19th century antiquary F.W.L. Thomas considered another saga character to be an eponymous ancestor of the MacLeods‚Äîthis character was Lj√≥t√≥lfr, who would have lived on Lewis about a century before Leod's time. Morrison considered it possible that Leod's name could have ultimately originated from that of Lj√≥t√≥lfr's; however, while he considered it possible that Lj√≥t√≥lfr could have been an ancestor of Leod, he did not think it could have been in the male-line. This webpage cited: Leod in clan tradition =Clans Mackenzie and Ross= The first earl of Cromartie's 17th century genealogical account of the MacLeods relates how Leod (\\"Leodus\\") was a son of Harald, son of Godred Donn. When the Isle of Man passed into the possession of the Scots, Alexander III granted Lewis, Harris, Waternish, and Minginish to Harald. Leod later succeeded his father to the lands as his father's only son. Cromartie's account also states how Leod's wife was Adama, daughter of Fearchar, Earl of Ross. However, according to Sellar, there is no record of a son of Harald named Leod, nor is there any record of a daughter of Fearchar named Adama. Sellar also noted that there is no record of the grant of lands by Alexander III. Sellar went so far as to state that Leod's wife, father, and the grant, were nothing but figments of Cromartie's imagination. The manuscript history of the Rosses of Balnagown also notes Leod. This account, according to the 19th-century historian W.F. Skene, is older than that of Cromartie's. The manuscript states that a King of Denmark had three sons who came to the north of Scotland‚ÄîGwine, Loid, and Leandres. Gwine conquered the braes of Caithness; Loid conquered Lewis, and was the progenitor of the MacLeods; and Leandres conquered \\"Braychat be the sworde\\". Skene stated that Gwine likely was meant to refer to the eponymous ancestor of the Clan Gunn, and that Leandres refers to the Gilleandres whom \\"Clan Andres, or old Rosses\\" took their name. =Clan MacLeod= According to an account of MacLeod tradition written in 1797 for the clan's chief, Olaf the Black had three sons by his third wife, Christina, daughter of the Earl of Ross‚ÄîGunn, from whom descended Clan Gunn; Leandres, from whom descended Clan Leandres in Ross; and Leod. The tradition goes on to say that Leod was fostered by \\"Pol, son of Bok\\", sheriff of Skye. This Pol then gave Leod Harris; later Leod married a daughter of \\"McCraild Armuinn\\" and, in consequence, received Dunvegan and all the Skye estates which the MacLeods held in later times. In the Bannatyne manuscript, the sheriff is called \\"Paal Baccas\\", and is stated to have owned the isle of Harris, as well as the following lands on Skye: Sleat, Trotternish, Waternish, and Snizort. The manuscript states that he had a natural son, but named Leod his heir. The \\"Pol, son of Bok\\" and \\"Paal Baccas\\" of MacLeod tradition are considered to be identical with the historical P√°ll, son of B√°lki, who is mentioned within the Chronicles of Mann as a loyal ally of Olaf the Black. The Bannatyne manuscript states that Paal Baccas was killed in 1231; after which Leod peacefully succeeded to his possessions. The Bannatyne manuscript is the main authority for information on the early chiefs of Clan MacLeod. This webpage cited: ; and also It states that the first seven chiefs of Clan MacLeod were buried at Iona. The choir of Iona Abbey, for the most part, dates from the early 16th century. Within the centre of the choir there is a large stone which once contained a monumental brass, traditionally said to have been a MacLeod. The stone formed a matrix which at one time contained the brass inlay (tradition states it was a silver inlay). It is the largest carved stone on the island, measuring by . The early 20th-century clan historian R.C. MacLeod speculated that perhaps Leod and five of his successors were buried beneath‚Äîhowever, in his opinion the fourth chief, Iain Ciar, was buried elsewhere. In fact, the stone may actually mark the tomb of a MacLean, rather than that of a MacLeod. =Issue= According to MacLeod tradition, Leod had two sons‚ÄîTormod and Torquil. The tradition is that Tormod was the ancestor of the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan (the chiefs of Clan MacLeod), and Torquil was the ancestor of the MacLeods of Lewis. The Bannatyne manuscript does not specifically state which son was the elder, and subsequently there has been debate over which branch was more 'senior' in descent. In the late 20th century, Matheson called into question this tradition of brothers, and his work was followed up by other historians. The current view of historians is that the two were not brothers at all; but that Torquil was actually the grandson of Tormod. see \\"!CAVEAT\\". The Bannatyne manuscript also names two other sons; however, Matheson considered the manuscript to be of dubious authority, since it is the only source for these names. This webpage cited: It lists Leod's third son as John, stating that John followed Bruce to Ireland. The manuscript continues that in Ireland he acquired considerable estates in Galway and was knighted; although he was the principal man of his name there, his descendants were known not as MacLeods, but as MacElliots. The manuscript states that his daughter, and heiress, married Maurice, 2nd Lord of Kerry. According to MacLeod, the statement about John following Bruce to Ireland is a mistake, since John's daughter couldn't have married later than 1285. Bruce was, however, born in 1275, and did not go to Ireland until 1306. Leod's fourth son is listed by the manuscript as being Olaus. The account states that this Olaus was the reputed ancestor of the MacLewis, or Fullarton family, which originated on the Isle of Arran and that this family traced its ancestry from Lewis, or MacLoy, son of Olaus, son of Leod. The manuscript also states that Leod also had two daughters. Again, the manuscript is the only source for the existence of these offspring and does not mention their names. This webpage cited: ; and also This webpage cited: ; and also It states that one of the daughters married Fergus of Galloway; while the other married John, Lord of Mull. It is unknown who these men could have been. DNA and the founder of Clan MacLeod In 2011, DNA tests were performed on a sample of 45 men with the surname MacLeod; 47% were found to share a common ancestor in the male line (the remaining 53% of the sample contained 9 different genetic male line lineages). The genetic marker of the 47%-lineage was found to be the S68 branch of Haplogroup R1b. This marker is found not only in the Western Isles, but also in Orkney, Shetland, England, Norway, and Sweden. In consequence, the study concluded that the genetic origin of Clan MacLeod likely lies in Scandinavia.

Jacob Roggeveen also found Bora Bora and Maupiti of the Society Islands, as well as Samoa. He planned the expedition along with his brother Jan Roggeveen, who stayed in the Netherlands. Early career His father, Arend Roggeveen, was a mathematician with much knowledge of astronomy, geography, rhetorics, philosophy, and the theory of navigation as well. He occupied himself with study of the mythical Terra Australis, and even got a patent for an exploratory excursion, but it was to be his son who, at the age of 62, eventually equipped three ships and made the expedition. He became notary of Middelburg (the capital of the province of Zeeland, where he was born). On 12 August 1690, he graduated as a doctor of the law at University of Harderwijk. He married Marija Margaerita Vincentius, but she died in October 1694. In 1706, he joined the Dutch East Indies Company (VOC), and between 1707 and 1714 as a Raadsheer van Justitie (\\"Council Lord of Justice\\") at Batavia, Dutch East Indies (now Jakarta). He married Anna Adriana Clement there, but she died soon afterward. In 1714, he returned to Middelburg by himself. He became involved in religious controversies, supporting the liberal preacher Pontiaan van Hattem by publishing his leaflet De val van 's werelds afgod (The fall of the world's idol). The first part appeared in 1718 in Middelburg, and was subsequently confiscated by the city council and burned. Roggeveen fled from Middelburg to nearby Flushing. Thereafter he established himself in the small town of Arnemuiden, and published parts 2 and 3 of the series, again raising a controversy. Explorations Roggeveen's itinerary On 1 August 1721 he headed an expedition sponsored by the Dutch West India Company, the rivals of the VOC, to seek Terra Australis and to open a western trade route to the \\"Spice islands\\".Quanchi, Historical Dictionary of the Discovery and Exploration of the Pacific Islands, page 217 His fleet consisted of three ships, the Arend, the Thienhoven, and Afrikaansche Galey and had 223 men on crew. Samoan Commemorative Coin 250 Years Discovery of Samoa by the Dutch Captain Jacob Roggeveen Roggeveen first sailed down to the Falkland Islands (which he renamed \\"Belgia Australis\\"), passed through the Strait of Le Maire, and continued south to beyond 60 degrees south to enter the Pacific Ocean. He made landfall near Valdivia, Chile. He visited the Juan Fern√°ndez Islands, where he spent 24 February to 17 March. The expedition later arrived at Easter Island (Rapa Nui) on Easter Sunday, 5 April 1722 (whereupon he reported seeing 2,000-3,000 inhabitants). Roggeveen charted the location of six islands in the Tuamotu Archipelago, two islands in the Society Islands, and four islands in Samoa, losing his flagship, Afrikaansche Galey at Takapoto atoll. At Makatea, he opened fire on a crowded beach in retaliation for a violent encounter with the inhabitants, and in return the Makateans ambushed a shore party, killing ten of his crewmen. The remaining two vessels sailed past New Guinea to reach Batavia in 1722, where he was arrested for violating the monopoly of the VOC and had his ships confiscated. After a lengthy lawsuit in the Netherlands, the VOC was later forced to compensate him for his losses and to pay his crew. After his return, Roggeveen published part 4 of De val van 's werelds afgod.

Kennan in 1947, the year the X Article was published The X Article, formally titled The Sources of Soviet Conduct and also known as the Long Telegram, was an article written by George F. Kennan under the pseudonym \\"Mr. X\\" and published in Foreign Affairs magazine in July 1947. Kennan, who was the Deputy Chief of Mission of the United States to the USSR from 1944 to 1946, advocated in the article a policy of containment of the Soviet Union and strong anti-communism. Background G. F. Kennan rejoined the U.S. Embassy in Moscow as Charg√© d'Affaires in July 1945. Although he was highly critical of the Soviet system, the mood within the U.S. State Department was friendship towards the Soviets, because the Soviets were an important ally in the war against Nazi Germany. Kennan proposed a policy known as Containment. In February 1946, the United States Treasury asked the U.S. Embassy in Moscow why the Soviets were not supporting the newly created World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. In reply, Kennan wrote the Long Telegram outlining his opinions and views of the Soviets; \\"According to Kennan, the Soviets' view of the world came from a traditional 'Russian sense of insecurity... It arrived in Washington on February 22, 1946. Among its most- remembered parts was that while Soviet power was \\"impervious to the logic of reason\\", it was \\"highly sensitive to the logic of force\\". The Long Telegram The preface to the Long Telegram includes the following comments: > Answer to Dept's 284, Feb. 3,13 involves questions so intricate, so > delicate, so strange to our form of thought, and so important to analysis of > our international environment that I cannot compress answers into single > brief message without yielding to what I feel would be a dangerous degree of > oversimplification. I hope, therefore, Dept will bear with me if I submit in > answer to this question five parts...I apologize in advance for this > burdening of telegraphic channel; but questions involved are of such urgent > importance, particularly in view of recent events, that our answers to them, > if they deserve attention at all, seem to me to deserve it at once. Kennan described dealing with Soviet Communism as \\"undoubtedly greatest task our diplomacy has ever faced and probably greatest it will ever have to face\\". In the first two sections, he posited concepts that became the foundation of American Cold War policy: * The Soviets perceived themselves at perpetual war with capitalism; * The Soviets viewed left-wing, but non-communist, groups in other countries as an even worse enemy of itself than the capitalist ones; * The Soviets would use controllable Marxists in the capitalist world as allies; * Soviet aggression was fundamentally not aligned with the views of the Russian people or with economic reality, but rooted in historic Russian nationalism and neurosis; * The Soviet government's structure inhibited objective or accurate pictures of internal and external reality. According to Kennan, the Soviet Union did not see the possibility for long-term peaceful coexistence with the capitalist world. The Soviets' ever-present aim was to advance the socialist cause. For the Soviets, capitalism was a menace to the ideals of socialism, and capitalists could not be trusted or allowed to influence the Soviet people. Outright conflict was never considered a desirable avenue for the propagation of the Soviet cause, but their eyes and ears were always open for the opportunity to take advantage of \\"diseased tissue\\" anywhere in the world. In Section Five, Kennan exposited Soviet weaknesses and proposed U.S. strategy, stating that despite the great challenge, \\"my conviction that problem is within our power to solve‚Äîand that without recourse to any general military conflict\\". He argued that the Soviet Union would be sensitive to force, that the Soviets were weak compared to the united Western world, that the Soviets were vulnerable to internal instability, and that Soviet propaganda was primarily negative and destructive. Kennan advocated sound appraisal, public education, solutions of the internal problems of U.S. society, proposing for other nations a positive picture of the world the U.S. would like to see, and faith in the superiority of the Western way of life over the collective ideals of Soviet Communists. Clifford-Elsey Report In July 1946, President Truman enlisted the services of one of his senior advisers, Clark Clifford, to prepare a report on Soviet relations that would provide detail on \\"Soviet disregard\\" for post-war agreements. The President, allegedly frustrated by Soviet actions, claimed he wanted \\"to be ready to reveal to the whole world the full truth about the Russian failure to honor agreements\\".Clark M. Clifford and Richard C. Holbrooke, Counsel to the President: A Memoir (New York: Random House, 1991). With the assistance of George Elsey, Clifford set out to write a report that would take the analysis of the Long Telegram and translate it into concrete policy recommendations. The pair solicited the input of senior officials in the Departments of State, War, and Justice, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Central Intelligence Group, and utilized the expertise of George Kennan and Charles Bohlen in writing their report. The final report, entitled American Relations with the Soviet Union, was presented solely to the President on September 24, 1946, and it did not circulate beyond his desk. In fact, President Truman ordered that all copies of the report be delivered to him because the report was of great value to him \\"but if it leaked, it would blow the roof off the White House... we'd have the most serious situation on our hands that has yet occurred in my Administration\\". The report would remain top secret and un-circulated until it appeared in Arthur Krock‚Äôs Memoirs in 1968. The report provided Truman with the background of wartime relations with the Soviet Union, insight into existing agreements, and most significantly, details on \\"Soviet violations\\" of agreements with the United States. It also stressed the importance of a well-informed public because \\"only a well- informed public will support the stern policies which Soviet activities make imperative\\".Clifford-Elsey Report, Accessed February 18, 2008. The first mention of the concept of \\"restraining and confining\\" the Soviet influence appeared in the Clifford-Elsey Report. Origin of the article The Sources of Soviet Conduct began as a private report prepared for Secretary of Defense James Forrestal in January 1947.George F. Kennan, Memoirs, 1925‚Äì1950 (Boston: Little, Brown, 1967), 354‚Äì356. It was never intended as a public document. On the urging, however, of Hamilton Fish Armstrong, editor of Foreign Affairs, Kennan obtained permission from Forrestal to publish the article under the pseudonym \\"X\\". When published, the article was not intended to be a statement of the government's official views of the Soviet situation. When it was revealed that the author was George Kennan, the connection to official policy was made, and some high-ranking officials, including Secretary of State George C. Marshall, questioned the approval for the publication.X. \\"The Sources of Soviet Conduct\\". Foreign Affairs 25, no. 4 (1947): 566‚Äì582. Kennan was heavily involved in the evolution of U.S. policy toward the Soviet Union following World War II. Both his writing of the Long Telegram and his input into the Clifford-Elsey Report factored into the content of the article. The Long Telegram was a review of how Kennan believed the Soviet Union saw the world. The Clifford-Elsey Report took that review and made it the basis for concrete policy suggestions. The X Article took the information presented in the two prior reports and constructed a road map for the Cold War. The article proved to be the public face of American foreign policy in the Cold War‚Äîeven though Kennan himself noted that he felt that he was misunderstood‚Äîin the statement that the \\"United States policy toward the Soviet Union must be that of a long- term, patient but firm and vigilant containment of Russian expansive tendencies\\". This policy was misinterpreted to mean that the U.S. would contain the Soviet Union globally. Much of the meaning that was interpreted from the article, even within the government, was not the true meaning that Kennan intended. He admitted that there were serious deficiencies in the article and he was afflicted with ulcers over the response that the article received.Charles Gati, \\"What Containment Meant\\", Foreign Policy, no. 7 (1972): 33.

The field lines are usually closed through a permanent magnet around the rotator. A Faraday rotator is a polarization rotator based on the Faraday effect, a magneto-optic effect involving transmission of light through a material when a longitudinal static magnetic field is present. The state of polarization (such as the axis of linear polarization or the orientation of elliptical polarization) is rotated as the wave traverses the device, which is explained by a slight difference in the phase velocity between the left and right circular polarizations. Thus it is an example of circular birefringence, as is optical activity, but involves a material only having this property in the presence of a magnetic field. Circular birefringence, involving a difference in propagation between opposite circular polarizations, is distinct from linear birefringence (or simply birefringence, when the term is not further specified) which also transforms a wave's polarization but not through a simple rotation. The polarization state is rotated in proportion to the applied longitudinal magnetic field according to: : \\\\beta = VBd \\\\\\\\! where \\\\beta is the angle of rotation (in radians), B is the magnetic flux density in the direction of propagation (in teslas), d is the length of the path (in metres) where the light and magnetic field interact, and V is the Verdet constant for the material. This empirical proportionality constant (in units of radians per tesla per metre, rad/(T¬∑m)) varies with wavelength and temperature and is tabulated for various materials. Faraday rotation is a rare example of non-reciprocal optical propagation. Although reciprocity is a basic tenet of electromagnetics, the apparent non- reciprocity in this case is a result of not considering the static magnetic field but only the resulting device. Unlike the rotation in an optically active medium such as a sugar solution, reflecting a polarized beam back through the same Faraday rotator does not undo the polarization change the beam underwent in its forward pass through the medium, but actually doubles it. Then by implementing a Faraday rotator with a rotation of 45¬∞, inadvertent downstream reflections from a linearly polarized source will return with the polarization rotated by 90¬∞ and can be simply blocked by a polarizer; this is the basis of optical isolators used to prevent undesired reflections from disrupting an upstream optical system (particularly a laser). The difference between Faraday rotation and other polarization rotation mechanisms is as follows. In an optically active medium, the polarization direction twists or rotates in the same sense (e.g. like a right-handed screw) for either direction, thus in the case of a plane reflection the original rotation is reversed, returning the incident beam to its original polarization. On the other hand, in a Faraday rotator, passage of light in opposite directions experience a magnetic field in opposite directions relative to the propagation direction, and since the rotation (relative to the direction of propagation) is determined by the magnetic field (see above equation), that rotation is opposite between the two propagating directions.

A member of the Washburn family of Maine, he was a U.S. Congressman and governor of Wisconsin, and served as a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Education and early career Washburn was born in Livermore (in modern-day Maine, then a part of Massachusetts), the son of Martha (n√©e Benjamin) and Israel Washburn, Sr. He was one of seven brothers, who included Israel Washburn, Jr., Elihu B. Washburne, William D. Washburn, and Charles Ames Washburn. Washburn attended school in Wiscasset, Maine, and later taught there in 1838‚Äì1839. In 1839 he moved to Davenport, Iowa Territory, where he taught school, worked in a store, and worked as a surveyor. Inspired by his brother Elihu who set up a legal practice in nearby Galena, Illinois, he studied law. In 1842 he was admitted to the Wisconsin bar and moved to Mineral Point, Iowa County, Wisconsin Territory, where he began a legal practice. Business =Land speculation and banking= In 1844, Washburn formed a partnership with land agent Cyrus Woodman. Together the two men developed a number of companies, such as the Wisconsin Mining Company. The most successful business venture undertaken by the men was land acquisition. In May 1855 they established Washburn's and Woodman's Mineral Point Bank. Washburn and Woodman dissolved their partnership amicably in 1855. =Minneapolis Mill Company= In 1856, the Minneapolis Mill Company was chartered by the Minnesota territorial legislature. Among the incorporators were Washburn's cousin Dorilus Morrison, and Robert Smith, an Illinois congressman who had acquired the rights to the water power at the west side of St. Anthony Falls in Minneapolis. The company struggled initially, and several of the early investors sold out. Washburn bought in and eventually became president. His brother William moved to Minneapolis about that time, and actively managed the company. The company built a dam, a canal and a complex set of water transfer tunnels which were then leased, along with land that the company owned at the foot of the falls, to a variety of mills ‚Äì cotton mills, woolen mills, sawmills and grist/flour mills. Eventually the work and investment of the two brothers paid off well, and they used their new-found capital to invest in mills themselves. =Lumber= In 1853, Washburn built a mill at Waubeck on the Chippewa River. In 1859 Washburn moved to La Crosse, Wisconsin, and after his war time service, he engaged in a project to clear the Black River to make it easier to drive logs. In 1871 he formed the La Crosse Lumber Company, which eventually sawed 20,000,000 board feet of lumber annually. He also had the largest shingle mill in the upper Mississippi valley. =Flour= In 1866, he built his own Washburn \\"B\\" Mill, which was thought at the time to be too large to ever turn a profit. However, he succeeded and in 1874 built an even larger Washburn \\"A\\" Mill. The original \\"A\\" mill complex was destroyed, along with several nearby buildings, in a flour explosion in 1878, but was later rebuilt.National Historic Landmarks Program (NHL) In 1877, Washburn teamed with John Crosby to form the Washburn-Crosby Company. At the same time, Washburn sent William Hood Dunwoody to England to open that market for spring wheat. Successful, Dunwoody became a silent partner and went on to become one of the wealthiest millers in the world. Dunwoody became a philanthropist endowing hospitals, educational facilities which became Dunwoody College of Technology, and a charitable home which ultimately became Dunwoody Village. The corporation eventually became known as General Mills. Politics and military career upright In 1854, Washburn ran for Congress as a Republican, later serving three terms as part of the 34th, 35th and 36th United States Congresses representing Wisconsin's 2nd congressional district, from March 4, 1855, to March 3, 1861. In his last term Washburn served as chairman of the Committee on Private Land Claims. He declined to run again in 1860. The Washburn family had always been strongly opposed to slavery. Washburn moved to La Crosse, Wisconsin in 1861 but returned to Washington, D.C., later that year as a delegate in the peace convention that was held in an attempt to prevent the American Civil War. He served in the Union Army during the Civil War, becoming colonel of the 2nd Wisconsin Volunteer Cavalry, on February 6, 1862; brigadier general of Volunteers on July 16, 1862; and major general on November 29, 1862. Washburn had the honor of having his appointment document signed by President Abraham Lincoln. At one point Ulysses S. Grant called Washburn \\"one of the best administrative officers we have.\\" He commanded the cavalry of the XIII Corps in the opening stages of Ulysses S. Grant's Vicksburg Campaign.John D. Winters, The Civil War in Louisiana, Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1963, , p. 294, 296 Once siege operations had begun against the city of Vicksburg and Grant called for all available forces, Washburn led a detachment of the XVI Corps during the siege of Vicksburg. He commanded the 1st Division in the XIII Corps in Nathanial P. Banks' operations along the Texas Coast leading the expedition against Fort Esperanza in November 1863. For the rest of the war he served in administrative capacities in Mississippi and Tennessee. While commanding Union forces in Memphis, he was the target of an unsuccessful raid led by Nathan B. Forrest to kidnap him and other Union generals.Battle Summary: Memphis, TN He left the Union Army on May 25, 1865. After the conclusion of the war, Washburn returned to his home in La Crosse, where he was elected again for two terms in the House of Representatives. This time he represented Wisconsin's 6th congressional district at the 40th and 41st Congresses from March 4, 1867, to March 3, 1871, where he was chairman of the Committee on Expenditures on Public Buildings in the first term. He declined to run in 1870. In 1871, he was urged to run for Governor of Wisconsin against James R. Doolittle. Washburn won the election and was inaugurated governor of Wisconsin on the first Monday in January 1872 and served from 1872 to 1874. He ran unsuccessfully for reelection in 1873. A year later, he purchased the Edgewood Villa estate from Samuel Marshall, where Edgewood College sits today. Family life Shortly after his birth in 1818, Washburn was diagnosed with epilepsy. On January 1st 1849, New Years Day, he married Jeanette Garr, daughter of Andrew Sheffield Garr and Elizabeth Sinclair Garr.On This Day in Wisconsin History Both were 30-years-old at the time. The following year, the couple brought their first daughter, Jeanette (Nettie) Garr Washburn, into the world in 1850. After giving birth to Nettie her mother, Jeanette, started showing signs of mental illness. After Frances (Fanny) was born two years later, in 1852, Washburn made arrangements for his wife's care at the Bloomingdale Asylum. Later she was transferred to an institution in Brookline, Massachusetts, where she remained until her death at age 90 in 1909. Later life Washburn donated the Edgewood Villa estate to the Sinsinawa Dominican Sisters of Madison, Wisconsin, in 1881. The Edgewood Villa later became Edgewood CollegeHistory of the College ‚Äì Edgewood College and Edgewood High School.Edgewood High School Nearly a year later, on May 14, 1882,Minnesota Reports: Cases Argued and Determined in the Supreme Court of Minnesota he died in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, while on a visit to the springs for his health.

It is a dangerous condition that may lead to brain injury and death. It may be primary or secondary. Ammonia is a substance that contains nitrogen. It is a product of the catabolism of protein. It is converted to the less toxic substance urea prior to excretion in urine by the kidneys. The metabolic pathways that synthesize urea involve reactions that start in the mitochondria and then move into the cytosol. The process is known as the urea cycle, which comprises several enzymes acting in sequence. It is greatly exacerbated by common zinc deficiency, which raises ammonia levels further. Signs and symptoms =Complication= Hyperammonemia is one of the metabolic derangements that contribute to hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause swelling of astrocytes and stimulation of NMDA-receptors in the brain. Overstimulation of NMDA-receptors induces excitotoxicity. Diagnosis =Types= Primary vs. secondary * Primary hyperammonemia is caused by several inborn errors of metabolism that are characterised by reduced activity of any of the enzymes in the urea cycle. The most common example is ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, which is inherited in an X-linked fashion. * Secondary hyperammonemia is caused by inborn errors of intermediary metabolism, which are characterised by reduced activity of enzymes that are not part of the urea cycle or dysfunction of cells that make major contributions to metabolism. Examples of the former are propionic acidemia and methylmalonic acidemia, and examples of the latter are acute liver failure and hepatic cirrhosis with liver failure. Acquired vs. congenital *Acquired hyperammonemia is usually caused by diseases that result in either acute liver failure, such as overwhelming hepatitis B or exposure to hepatoxins, or cirrhosis of the liver with chronic liver failure. Chronic hepatitis B, chronic hepatitis C, and excessive alcohol consumption are common causes of cirrhosis. The physiologic consequences of cirrhosis include shunting of blood from the liver to the inferior vena cava, resulting in decreased filtration of blood and removal of nitrogen-containing toxins by the liver, and then hyperammonemia. This type of hyperammonemia can be treated with antibiotics to kill the bacteria that initially produce the ammonia, though this doesn't work as well as removal of protein from the colon prior to its digestion to ammonia, achieved by lactulose administration for frequent (3-4 per day) bowel movements. *Medication induced hyperammonemia can occur with valproic acid overdose, and is due to a deficiency in carnitine. Its treatment is carnitine replacement. *Severe dehydration and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth can also lead to acquired hyperammonemia. *Glycine toxicity causes hyperammonemia, which manifests as CNS symptoms and nausea. Transient blindness can also occur. *Congenital hyperammonemia is usually due to genetic defects in one of the enzymes of the urea cycle, such as ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, which leads to lower production of urea from ammonia. Specific types The following list includes such examples: * - hyperammonemia due to ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency * - hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia syndrome (glutamate dehydrogenase 1) * - hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria * - hyperammonemia due to N-acetylglutamate synthetase deficiency * - hyperammonemia due to carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency (carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I) * - hyperlysinuria with hyperammonemia (genetics unknown) * Methylmalonic acidemia * Isovaleric acidemia * Propionic acidemia * Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency * Transient hyperammonemia of the newborn, specifically in the preterm Treatment Treatment centers on limiting intake of ammonia and increasing its excretion. Dietary protein, a metabolic source of ammonium, is restricted and caloric intake is provided by glucose and fat. Intravenous arginine (argininosuccinase deficiency), sodium phenylbutyrate and sodium benzoate (ornithine transcarbamoylase deficiency) are pharmacologic agents commonly used as adjunctive therapy to treat hyperammonemia in patients with urea cycle enzyme deficiencies.eMedicine - Hyperammonemia: Article by Kazi Imran Majeed Sodium phenylbutyrate and sodium benzoate can serve as alternatives to urea for the excretion of waste nitrogen. Phenylbutyrate, which is the product of phenylacetate, conjugates with glutamine to form phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted by the kidneys. Similarly, sodium benzoate reduces ammonia content in the blood by conjugating with glycine to form hippuric acid, which is rapidly excreted by the kidneys. A preparation containing sodium phenylacetate and sodium benzoate is available under the trade name Ammonul. Acidification of the intestinal lumen using lactulose can decrease ammonia levels by protonating ammonia and trapping it in the stool. This is a treatment for hepatic encephalopathy. Treatment of severe hyperammonemia (serum ammonia levels greater than 1000 Œºmol/L) should begin with hemodialysis if it is otherwise medically appropriate and tolerated.Chapter 298 ‚Äì Inborn Errors of Metabolism and Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy in: See also * Arginase deficiency * Citrullinemia * N-acetylglutamate synthetase deficiency * Ornithine translocase deficiency * Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency * Orotic aciduria References  External links  Category:Amino acid metabolism disorders Category:Ammonia ","title":"Hyperammonemia"},{"id":"549838","text":"WhakatƒÅne ( , ) is a town in the eastern Bay of Plenty region in the North Island of New Zealand, east of Tauranga and north-east of Rotorua, at the mouth of the WhakatƒÅne River. WhakatƒÅne District is the encompassing territorial authority, which covers an area to the south and west of the town, excluding the enclave of Kawerau. WhakatƒÅne has an urban population of , making it New Zealand's 33rd largest urban area, and the Bay of Plenty's third largest urban area behind Tauranga and Rotorua. Another people live in the rest of the WhakatƒÅne District. Around 40% of the district's population have MƒÅori ancestry. The district has a land area of . WhakatƒÅne District was created in 1976. WhakatƒÅne forms part of the parliamentary electorate of East Coast, represented by Anne Tolley of the New Zealand National Party. It is the main urban centre of the eastern Bay of Plenty sub-region; incorporating WhakatƒÅne, Kawerau, and ≈åp≈çtiki, the eastern Bay stretches from Otamarakau in the west, to Cape Runaway in the north-east and Whirinaki in the south. It is the seat of the Bay of Plenty Regional Council, chosen as a compromise between the region's two larger cities, Tauranga and Rotorua. History and culture =MƒÅori occupation= The site of the town has long been populated. MƒÅori pƒÅ (MƒÅori fortified village) sites in the area date back to the first Polynesian settlements, estimated to have been around 1200 CE. According to MƒÅori tradition Toi-te-huatahi, later known as Toi-kai-rakau, landed at WhakatƒÅne about 1150 CE in search of his grandson Whatonga. Failing to find Whatonga, he settled in the locality and built a pa on the highest point of the headland now called WhakatƒÅne Heads, overlooking the present town. Some 200 years later the MƒÅtaatua waka landed at WhakatƒÅne. The Maori name is reputed to commemorate an incident occurring after the arrival of the Mataatua. The men had gone ashore and the canoe began to drift. Wairaka, a chieftainess, said \\"Kia whakatƒÅne au i ahau\\" (\\"I will act like a man\\"), and commenced to paddle ‚Äì something that women were not allowed to do. With the help of the other women, the canoe was saved. Wairaka's efforts are commemorated by a bronze statue of her at the mouth of the WhakatƒÅne River, which was installed in 1965. MƒÅori prophet Rua Kenana Hepetipa meets with Prime Minister Joseph Ward in WhakatƒÅne, 1908. The region around WhakatƒÅne was important during the New Zealand Wars of the mid 19th century, particularly the Volkner Incident. Its role culminated in 1869 with raids by Te Kooti's forces and a number of its few buildings were razed, leading to an armed constabulary being stationed above the town for a short while. WhakatƒÅne beach heralded a historic meeting on 23 March 1908 between Prime Minister Joseph Ward and the MƒÅori prophet and activist Rua Kenana Hepetipa. Kenana claimed to be Te Kooti's successor. =European settlement= WhakatƒÅne township (ca. 1910s), with the Whakatane Hotel on the left. The town was a notable shipbuilding and trade centre from 1880 and with the draining of the RangitƒÅiki swamp into productive farmland from 1904, WhakatƒÅne grew considerably. In the early 1920s it was the fastest growing town in the country for a period of about three years and this saw the introduction of electricity for the first time. The carton board mill at WhakatƒÅne began as a small operation in 1939 and continues operating to this day. The WhakatƒÅne River once had a much longer and more circuitous route along the western edge of the WhakatƒÅne urban area, having been significantly re-coursed in the 1960s with a couple of its loopier loops removed to help prevent flooding and provide for expansion of the town. Remnants of the original watercourse remain as Lake Sullivan and the Awatapu lagoon. The original wide-span ferro-concrete bridge constructed in 1911 at the (aptly named) Bridge Street was demolished in 1984 and replaced by the Landing Road bridge.Skelton, H (2002) Pictures from the Past- Bay of Plenty, Volcanic Plateau & Gisborne. Wyatt and Wilson Print, Christchurch. ;pg 76. Overlooking WhakatƒÅne and Pohaturoa Rock, 1975 WhakatƒÅne has in recent years benefited from its relative dominance over numerous smaller and less prosperous towns surrounding it, such as Te Teko (affectionately known as 'Texas') and Waimana, and its popularity as a retirement and lifestyle destination. =Mataatua Declaration= The 'First International Conference on the Cultural and Intellectual Property Rights of Indigenous Peoples' was held in WhakatƒÅne from 12 to 18 June 1993. This resulted in the Mataatua Declaration on Cultural and Intellectual Property Rights of Indigenous Peoples', commonly referred to as the Mataatua Declaration. =Marae= WhakatƒÅne has five marae, which are meeting places for NgƒÅti Awa hap≈´: * Te Hokowhitu a T≈´ ki te RƒÅhui Marae and Te Hokowhitu a T≈´matauenga meeting house is affiliated with NgƒÅti Wharepaia and NgƒÅti Hokop≈´ - Te Hokowhitu a Tu Ki Te RƒÅhui. * Te Rangihouhiri II Marae and Te Rangihouhiri II meeting house is affiliated with NgƒÅi Te Rangihouhiri II. * Tokitareke or Warahoe Marae and Te Puna o Te Orohi meeting house is affiliated with Warahoe. * Toroa or Pupuaruhe Marae and Toroa meeting house is affiliated with Te Patuwai. * Te Whare o Toroa Marae and Wairaka meeting house is affiliated with NgƒÅti Wharepaia and NgƒÅti Hokop≈´ - Te Whare o Toroa. In October 2020, the Government committed from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrading Te Hokowhitu a T≈´ ki te RƒÅhui Marae and 11 other NgƒÅti Awa marae, creating 23 jobs. It also committed $282,275 to upgrade Te Whare o Toroa Marae, creating an estimated 21 jobs. Demographics Whakatane District had a population of 35,700 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 3,009 people (9.2%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 2,400 people (7.2%) since the 2006 census. There were 12,468 households. There were 17,442 males and 18,258 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.96 males per female. Of the total population, 8,013 people (22.4%) were aged up to 15 years, 6,177 (17.3%) were 15 to 29, 15,303 (42.9%) were 30 to 64, and 6,207 (17.4%) were 65 or older. Figures may not add up to the total due to rounding. Ethnicities were 63.2% European/PƒÅkehƒÅ, 46.8% MƒÅori, 3.0% Pacific peoples, 3.4% Asian, and 1.3% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity. The percentage of people born overseas was 11.8, compared with 27.1% nationally. Although some people objected to giving their religion, 48.1% had no religion, 32.9% were Christian, and 11.7% had other religions. Of those at least 15 years old, 4,089 (14.8%) people had a bachelor or higher degree, and 5,925 (21.4%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $26,300. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 12,303 (44.4%) people were employed full- time, 4,389 (15.9%) were part-time, and 1,587 (5.7%) were unemployed. Climate WhakatƒÅne has frequently recorded the highest annual sunshine hours in New Zealand (year and respective sunshine hours shown below). Since official recording began in 2008, the town has frequently attained upwards of 2600 hours a year. The town recorded an average of over 7.5hrs of sunshine a day in 2013. WhakatƒÅne also records the national daily high (temp) on approximately 55 days of the year. =Natural disasters= WhakatƒÅne was affected by the 1987 Edgecumbe earthquake. Heavy rain struck the Bay of Plenty region between 16‚Äì18 July 2004, resulting in severe flooding and a state of civil emergency being declared. Many homes and properties were flooded, forcing thousands of WhakatƒÅne residents to evacuate. The Rangitaiki River burst its banks, flooding large areas of farmland, and numerous roads were closed by floods and slips. A total of 245.8 mm of rain fell in WhakatƒÅne in the 48-hour period and many small earthquakes were also felt during this time, loosening the sodden earth and resulting in landslips that claimed two lives. Geography A groundswell at the WhakatƒÅne Heads Bush near WhakatƒÅne is renowned for its biodiversity Moutohora Island is a small island off the Bay of Plenty coast about 12 kilometres north of WhakatƒÅne. The island has numerous sites of pƒÅ. It also provided shelter for James Cook's Endeavour in 1769. A whaling station existed on the island during the 19th century. Whakaari/White Island is an active marine volcano located 48 kilometres offshore of WhakatƒÅne and a popular visitor attraction. Sulphur mining on the island was attempted but abandoned in 1914 after a lahar killed all 10 workers. The mouth of the WhakatƒÅne River and Ohiwa Harbour have both provided berths for yachts, fishing trawlers and small ships since European settlement of the area. Nearby ≈åhope Beach is a sandy beach stretching from the Ohiwa Harbour entrance. Industries and tourism The town's main industries are diverse: forestry, tourism, agriculture, horticulture, fishing and manufacturing are all well-established. There is a large carton board packaging mill, a newspaper press, and a brewery. While farming and forestry activities remain the dominant sectors, tourism is a growing industry for WhakatƒÅne, with a continued increase in guest nights in the district. White Island is a key attraction. Popular tourist activities include the beaches, swimming with dolphins, whale watching, chartered fishing cruises, surf tours, amateur astronomy, hunting, experiences of Maori culture and bush walking. WhakatƒÅne is also used as a base for many tourists who wish to explore other activities in the surrounding region. Aquaculture is an emerging industry for the Eastern Bay, with the development of a 3800 hectare marine farm 8.5 km offshore of ≈åp≈çtiki, expected to produce 20,000 tonnes of mussels per annum by 2025 and add $35 million to regional GDP. WhakatƒÅne is home to the regional radio station One Double X - 1XX ‚Äì one of the first privately owned commercial radio stations on air in New Zealand in the early 1970s. WhakatƒÅne has become the dominant commercial service centre for the Eastern Bay. In 2006, a large- format shopping centre (The Hub Whakatane) was built on the edge of town anchored by national chains Bunnings Warehouse and Harvey Norman. Its retail space totals 24,000sqm and includes 900 car parks. Prior to the centre's construction, it was estimated around $30 million in local retail spending was being lost to large format retail stores in neighboring Tauranga and Rotorua.  Infrastructure  The terminal of the WhakatƒÅne Airport. Whakatane Airport is served by Air Chathams with direct flights to Auckland using Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner aircraft. Air New Zealand previously operated the Auckland service until April 2015. Private cars, limited public transport and taxis (as well as cycling and walking) are the primary modes of transport for residents. WhakatƒÅne sits at the eastern end of State Highway 30. State Highway 2 bypasses the urban area. = Bus = BayBus runs between WhakatƒÅne and ≈åhope. Furthermore, once daily return bus services operate to Tauranga, en route from Kawerau and ≈åp≈çtiki on alternate weekdays. Bee cards were introduced for fares on 27 July 2020. =Marine= People working at the Whakatane wharf, ca 1910s. Coastal trading, including scows and steamships ‚Äì notably the Northern Steamship Company service, which ran until 1959, used WhakatƒÅne as a port of call. Today it primarily services charter vessels, commercial & recreational fishing vessels. The depth of water over the WhakatƒÅne River entrance has been a limiting factor to the development of better port facilities, but it is generally held that a training wall along the western edge of the entrance would allow greater depths and safer crossings. =Rail= A passenger train called the Taneatua Express ran on the East Coast Main Trunk Railway (ECMT) as far as Taneatua until 1959. The Taneatua Branch line was formerly part of the ECMT and connected with the current ECMT at Hawkens Junction. A private railway line operated by Whakatane Board Mills (now Carter Holt Harvey WhakatƒÅne) formerly connected the company's mill on the western side of the river to the Taneatua Branch line at Awakeri. The Whakatane Board Mills Line was freight only, with no passenger service. In 1999 operation of the Whakatane Board Mills line was taken over by Tranz Rail (now KiwiRail) and the line was renamed the Whakatane Industrial line. The line has since been closed and lifted, and the Taneatua Branch line is used for tourist excursions. Education WhakatƒÅne has two secondary schools: Whakatane High School, with a roll of , and Trident High School, with a roll of . Two tertiary institutes, Te Whare Wananga O Awanuiarangi and Toi Ohomai Institute of Technology, have campuses in WhakatƒÅne.

He moved to the United States in 1991 and was a naturalized American citizen. He was a jury member of the Dr. Rainer Hildebrandt international human rights award. Career Khrushchev held several advanced engineering degrees. From the Ukrainian Academy of Science, he earned his doctoral degree, and he earned a Ph.D. from the Moscow Technical University. In addition, he earned an M.A. degree with distinction from the Moscow Electric Power Institute. He also held an \\"occasional\\" professorship at the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, meaning he was not a full-time professor (though he was for some time), but did teach there fairly often. Prior to emigrating from the Soviet Union to the United States in 1991, Khrushchev worked in various high-level engineering positions. From 1968 to 1991, he served at the Control Computer Institute in Moscow, where he rose from section head to first deputy director in charge of research. From the years 1958 to 1968, Dr. Khrushchev worked as an engineer, then later as a deputy section head in charge of guidance systems for missile and space design. In this capacity, he worked on cruise missiles for submarine craft, military and research spacecraft, moon vehicles, and the \\"Proton\\" space booster.

It is native to the upper Orinoco and Negro Rivers in South America. This fish is similar in appearance to the closely related and better-known neon tetra, but it is slightly smaller, and its red patch is less pronounced, while the blue-green areas of the upper body are more brilliant. Also, its body is slimmer than that of the neon tetra. It grows to a maximum overall length of about . Like the other Paracheirodon species, the green neon tetra is kept as an aquarium fish, but it is less commonly seen than either the neon tetra or the cardinal tetra. P. simulans is also sometimes called the blue or false neon. Hyphessobrycon simulans and Cheirodon simulans are obsolete synonyms. A Green neon tetra with the lack of red stripe clearly visible This fish loses its brilliant blue and red colors when lights are switched off, but regains them when lights are switched on again. The green neon tetra comes from extremely soft, acidic water at temperatures around . Breeding For breeding, these tetras need water similar to the waters in which they live in the wild; extremely soft water with a pH of about 6 and a temperature of around . Ideally, the water should be highly stained by the tannins from peat, in subdued light, shaded by plants. It spawns in a school, although in the actual act of spawning, one female may be closely associated with one or more males. About 130 eggs can be laid by each female. The parents should be removed after spawning. The eggs should hatch in 24 hours. The eggs are light sensitive so avoid light. The babies are very small, so feeding infusoria (protozoa) is necessary early on. As they grow, this can increasingly be supplemented with fine commercial fry foods. Adults can breed again after a few weeks.

It is usually sung to the tune Sandon by Charles H. Purday, Lux Benigna composed by John Bacchus Dykes in 1865, to Alberta by William H. Harris, or as a choral anthem by John Stainer (1886).http://www1.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Lead,_kindly_Light_(John_Stainer) Arthur Sullivan also did a setting, Lux in Tenebris, which Ian Bradley praises as a \\"much more sensitive and honest setting of Newman's ambiguity and expressions of doubt\\" than Dykes‚Äôs \\"steady, reassuring\\" rhythms. As a young priest, Newman became sick while in Italy and was unable to travel for almost three weeks. In his own words: :Before starting from my inn, I sat down on my bed and began to sob bitterly. My servant, who had acted as my nurse, asked what ailed me. I could only answer, \\"I have a work to do in England.\\" I was aching to get home, yet for want of a vessel I was kept at Palermo for three weeks. I began to visit the churches, and they calmed my impatience, though I did not attend any services. At last I got off in an orange boat, bound for Marseilles. We were becalmed for whole week in the Straits of Bonifacio, and it was there that I wrote the lines, Lead, Kindly Light, which have since become so well known. Notable occasions relating to hymn The largest mining disaster in the Durham Coalfield in England was at West Stanley Colliery, known locally as \\"The Burns Pit\\", when 168 men and boys lost their lives as the result of two underground explosions at 3.45pm on Tuesday 16 February 1909. In the Towneley Seam 63 lay dead, in the Tilley Seam 18 lay dead, in the Busty Seam 33 lay dead and in the Brockwell Seam 48 lay dead. But incredibly, there were still men alive underground. A group of 34 men and boys in the Tilley Seam had found a pocket of clean air. They were led by Deputy Mark Henderson. Sadly a few of them panicked and left the group, they died instantly after inhaling the poison gas. The remainder sat in almost total darkness, when one of them began humming the Hymn \\"Lead Kindly Light\\". In no time at all, the rest of the miners joined in with the words, \\"Lead kindly light amidst the encircling gloom, lead thou me on, The night is dark, and I am far from home\\". This was probably sung to the tune \\"Sandon\\" by C. H. Purday, popular with miners in the Durham coalfield. Before the hymn ended, young Jimmy Gardner died of injuries. These 26 men were rescued after 14 hours, four others were later rescued. \\"It is God's Way - Lead, Kindly Light\\" Portrait Plaque, ca. 1901 \\"Lead, Kindly Light\\" was sung by Betsie ten Boom, sister of Corrie ten Boom, and other women as they were led by the S.S. Guards to the Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp during the Holocaust.Corrie Ten Boom. The Hiding Place. USA: Bantam Books, 1974. pp. 190. Paperback Lead, Kindly Light was sung by a soloist, Marion Wright, on the RMS Titanic during a hymn- singing gathering led by the Rev. Ernest C. Carter, shortly before the ocean liner struck an iceberg on April 14, 1912. The hymn was also sung aboard one of the Titanic's lifeboats when the rescue ship Carpathia was sighted the following morning. It was suggested by one of the occupants, No√´lle, Countess of Rothes.Kansas City Star, July 31, 1918. On one occasion in February 1915, Lead, Kindly Light was sung by a group of British troops to the accompaniment of nearby artillery fire on the Western Front during the First World War at services held before going into the trenches the following day. Lead, Kindly Light is also the motto for the Cambridge High School, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, The Little Flower Higher Secondary School, Salem, Tamil Nadu, India, Saundararaja Vidhyalaya, Dindigul, Tamil Nadu, India, Mangalam College of Engineering, Ettumanoor, Kerala, India, St. Thomas Public School Pune, Maharashtra, Indiahttp://stthomaspublicschool.in/school-prayer-2/ and for Sri Kumaran Children's Home, Bangalore, Karnataka, India. The hymn is referred to in Chapter LVI entitled 'Beauty in Loneliness - After All' from Thomas Hardy's novel Far From The Madding Crowd.Thomas Hardy. Far From The Madding Crowd. London: Penguin, 1994. pp. 361-2. The hymn was also a favourite of Mahatma Gandhi and is mentioned at the Gandhi Museum in Madurai, Tamil Nadu. Verses Edward Henry Bickersteth (later Bishop of Exeter) added a fourth 'pirate verse' for the poem's republication in the Hymnal Companion in 1870. Newman was not pleased, writing to the publishers: \\"It is not that the verse is not both in sentiment and language graceful and good, but I think you will at once see how unwilling an author must be to subject himself to the inconvenience of that being ascribed to him which is not his own.\\" This verse is not commonly now included as part of the hymn. Lead, Kindly Light, amidst th'encircling gloom, Lead Thou me on! The night is dark, and I am far from home, Lead Thou me on! Keep Thou my feet; I do not ask to see The distant scene; one step enough for me. I was not ever thus, nor prayed that Thou Shouldst lead me on; I loved to choose and see my path; but now Lead Thou me on! I loved the garish day, and, spite of fears, Pride ruled my will. Remember not past years! So long Thy power hath blest me, sure it still Will lead me on. O'er moor and fen, o'er crag and torrent, till The night is gone, And with the morn those angel faces smile, Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile! Meantime, along the narrow rugged path, Thyself hast trod, Lead, Saviour, lead me home in childlike faith, Home to my God. To rest forever after earthly strife In the calm light of everlasting life.

The highway's northern terminus is in Presho, South Dakota, at an intersection with Interstate 90. Its southern terminus is in Refugio, Texas, at the southern intersection of U.S. Highway 77 and Alternate US 77 (US 183 and Alt US 77 run concurrently for their final between Cuero and Refugio). US 183 was the last U.S. Route to be completely paved. The segment in Loup County, Nebraska, north of Taylor, was unpaved until 1967. Route description =Texas= US-183 begins in Refugio, sharing a multiplex with US-77A. The two highways continue north through Goliad County until they split in DeWitt County. US-183 crosses I-10 south of the town of Luling. The largest city that US-183 passes through is Austin, Texas, where it is mostly a limited access highway. Northwest of Austin, US-183 passes through the suburbs of Cedar Park and Leander, where the 183A toll road runs parallel to it. In Lampasas County, US-183 shares a multiplex with US-190 between the towns of Lampasas and Lometa. US-183 shares a multiplex with US-84 from Goldthwaite in Mills County to Early in Brown County. It crosses I-20 in Cisco, Texas. US-183 enters a multiplex with US-283 in Throckmorton County, and both highways share a multiplex with US-277 and US-82 in Baylor County from Seymour to Mabelle. In Wilbarger County, US-183 exits the multiplex with US-283 and turns east with US-70 to share a wrong way concurrency with US-287 between the towns of Vernon and Oklaunion. US-183 continues north sharing a multiplex with US-70 until it leaves the state of Texas. =Oklahoma= US 183/US 70 enters Oklahoma by crossing the Red River south of Davidson, OK. In Davidson, US 70 splits from US 183, leaving US 183 on its own. This continues as US 183 passes US 62 and BUS 62 in Snyder, OK. About north of Snyder, US 183 crosses Interstate 40 at Interstate 40's exit 66. Another later, US 183 co-signs with US 270 near Seiling, OK. US 183/US 270 continue in a northwesterly direction for before picking up US 412 in Woodward, OK. US 183/US 270/US 412 then leave Woodward in a due west fashion for a short time, until heading northwest again for , at which time US 270 and US 412 leave US 183 near Fort Supply, OK to form their own duplex through the panhandle of Oklahoma as US 270/US 412. US 183 then continues north from the southern Harper County line to the Oklahoma/Kansas state line for a total of about before leaving the state. = Kansas = US-183 enters Kansas in Clark County and turns east at Sitka, where it begins a multiplex with US-160, entering Comanche County, where it passes through Protection. The highways stay paired as it turns north to pass through the Comanche County seat, Coldwater. At Coldwater, US-160 turns back to the east, and US-183 continues its northerly track. US-183 running concurrently with US-160 in southern Comanche County. Entering Kiowa County, US-183 reaches a junction with the multiplexed east-west route, US-54 and US-400, where it passes through Greensburg. In southern Edwards County, the highway makes a brief turn to the west before meeting up with US-56 in Kinsley, the Edwards County seat. US-56 and US-183 turn northeast before the highways split after entering Pawnee County. US-56 continues northeast toward Larned, and US-183 straightens out to pass through largely unpopulated areas in Edwards County. In Rush County, US-183 intersects two primary east-west Kansas state highways, K-96 in Rush Center and K-4 in LaCrosse. US-183 reaches the largest city along its route in Kansas, Hays, where a western bypass of the highway provides direct access to Gross Memorial Coliseum and Fort Hays State University. US-183 is known as Vine Street in Hays and contains numerous businesses. US-183 runs through town for three miles (5 km) before crossing Interstate 70, which is heavily traveled in Hays with traffic between Denver and Kansas City. The interchange of US-183 and I-70 has been designated as the CW2 Bryan J. Nichols Fallen Veterans Memorial Interchange. North of Hays, the highway has been resurfaced and realigned for to Plainville, one of two towns in Rooks County US-183 serves. At Plainville, US-183 has a junction with K-18. US-183 continues north to Stockton, the Rooks County seat, where US-24 crosses. The highway enters Phillips County approximately north of Stockton. US-183 meets US-36 west, and the highways join for a multiplex through the city of Phillipsburg. The highways split in downtown Phillipsburg, and US-183 has one last junction with K-383 before exiting the state south of Alma, Nebraska. US-183 is two-laned throughout Kansas, except for the portion which runs through Hays. =Nebraska= U.S. Highway 183 enters Nebraska south of Alma. It enters Alma after crossing Harlan County Lake and the Republican River and then runs concurrent with U.S. Highway 136 north out of Alma. After separating from US 136, US 183 continues north to Holdrege, where it intersects U.S. Highway 6 and U.S. Highway 34. US 183 continues north from Holdrege and intersects Interstate 80 south of Elm Creek shortly after crossing the Platte River. It then proceeds north into Elm Creek and meets U.S. Highway 30. US 183 continues north through Miller and intersects Nebraska Highway 2 at Ansley. It continues north from Ansley through Sargent, Taylor, and Rose before meeting U.S. Highway 20 in Bassett.

Background Born in Sicily, Italy, Agostino was raised in Hamilton, Ontario and attended Mohawk College in that city. He worked as rehabilitation counsellor with the Ontario March of Dimes, and was a special assistant to Ontario Minister of Culture Lily Munro from 1985 to 1987. Politics Agostino was elected as a Catholic separate school board trustee in the Hamilton-Wentworth board at the age of 21, serving from 1980 to 1987. He campaigned in the 1985 provincial election in Hamilton Mountain, and finished third against New Democrat Brian Charlton. He then served as an alderman on the Hamilton City Council from 1987 until the provincial election of 1995. He was elected as the Member of Provincial Parliament for Hamilton East. He was the first Liberal candidate to win the riding since 1937, and the first member of Hamilton's Italian community to win a provincial election anywhere in the city. He defeated Andrew MacKenzie, the son of outgoing New Democratic Party Labour Minister Bob Mackenzie, by about 4,000 votes. The 1995 election was won by the Progressive Conservative Party, and Agostino quickly emerged as a prominent figure in the parliamentary opposition. He became a leading spokesperson for the Liberal Party's left wing, and gained particular praise for his performance as the party's Environment Critic from 1996 to 1999. In 1996, Agostino supported Gerard Kennedy's unsuccessful bid for the party leadership. He was re-elected without difficulty in the provincial election of 1999, and served as Chief Opposition Whip from 1999 to 2002. Unlike some others in his party, he supported the City of Hamilton's amalgamation in 2000. The Liberals won a majority government in the provincial election of 2003, although Agostino was re-elected with a somewhat reduced margin of victory. To the surprise of many in the province, he was not appointed to the first cabinet of Dalton McGuinty in October 2003. This was widely interpreted as a snub, but subsequent events cast the decision in a much different light: Agostino died on March 24, 2004, of liver cancer. He had been battling the disease for some time and had undergone surgery during the 2003 campaign, although this information was not made public until his death. In a by- election to fill his legislative seat held on May 13, 2004, his brother Ralph, a Catholic separate school board trustee, failed to retain the Hamilton East seat for the Liberal Party, falling far behind city councillor and NDP candidate Andrea Horwath. Sexuality Shortly after his death, the Toronto- based LGBT community magazine fab published a piece titled \\"Why Did He Die a Straight Man?\\", in which the author, Eleanor Brown, alleged that Agostino was in the closet about his sexuality; she highlighted Agostino's support for legislation granting spousal benefits to same-sex partners, attendance at Gay Day at Canada's Wonderland in 1997, and regular patronage of clubs in Toronto's Church and Wellesley area. Neither Agostino nor his friends made any public statement on the matter. Agostino was quoted as saying: \\"As long as you are consistent, your private life should remain private.\\" Initial media reports on his death stated erroneously that he was married, naming Agostino's sister-in-law Rose as his wife. This was quickly retracted by the media, and attributed to a journalist's misinterpretation of the government press release announcing Agostino's death (\\"Our thoughts and love are with Dominic's mother Theresa, his brother Ralph and his wife Rose, Dominic's sister Mary and her husband Tony, and Dominic's beloved nieces and nephews.\\") References External links * Category:1959 births Category:2004 deaths Category:Deaths from cancer in Ontario Category:Deaths from liver cancer Category:People from Sicily Category:Canadian people of Sicilian descent Category:Italian emigrants to Canada Category:Ontario Liberal Party MPPs Category:Gay politicians Category:Canadian LGBT people in provincial and territorial legislatures Category:Hamilton, Ontario city councillors Category:Ontario school board trustees Category:21st-century Canadian politicians ","title":"Dominic Agostino"},{"id":"549880","text":"Frankfurt at this house in K√∂nigstein, where he was attended by his sister, Anna. Stefan Anton George (; 12 July 18684 December 1933) was a German symbolist poet and a translator of Dante Alighieri, William Shakespeare, and Charles Baudelaire. Biography =Early life= George was born in 1868 in B√ºdesheim (now part of Bitburg-Pr√ºm) in the Grand Duchy of Hesse (now part of Rhineland-Palatinate). His father, also Stefan George, was an inn keeper and wine merchant and his mother Eva (n√©e Schmitt) was a homemaker. When Stefan was five years old, the family moved to Bingen am Rhein. Michael and Erika Metzger (1972), Stefan George, Twayne's World Authors Series. Page 13. According to Michael and Erika Metzger, both sides of the George family had lived in the area for generations and had risen from peasants, to millers, and finally to small town merchants. Michael and Erika Metzger (1972), Stefan George, Twayne's World Authors Series. Page 13. At the time, the Roman Catholic Church was very important to the daily life of Bingen and to the George family. Life revolved around the feast days of the Church Calendar. Furthermore, when Stefan's mother died, the oleander trees she had planted when she had married her husband were donated to the nuns of the nearby Rochusberg, which symbolized a returning of God's gifts to Him. Michael and Erika Metzger (1972), Stefan George, Twayne's World Authors Series. Page 14. After attending primary school in Bingen, Stefan was sent, at the age of thirteen, to one of the best secondary schools in the Grand Duchy of Hesse, the Ludwig-Georgs-Gymnasium in the Ducal Capitol of Darmstadt. There, from 1882 to 1888, Stefan, \\"received a vigorous humanistic education in which Greek, Latin, and French were stressed.\\" Michael and Erika Metzger (1972), Stefan George, Twayne's World Authors Series. Pages 14-15. Stefan \\"excelled in French\\" and gained \\"a thorough knowledge of modern European literature, as well as of the Greek and Roman authors.\\" Michael and Erika Metzger (1972), Stefan George, Twayne's World Authors Series. Page 15. Although later described as a loner, Stefan assembled his first circle of friends in Darmstadt, where he had access to libraries and to the theater, which fascinated him. He also taught himself to read Norwegian in order to read the works of Henrik Ibsen in the original. Michael and Erika Metzger (1972), Stefan George, Twayne's World Authors Series. Page 15. At the age of nineteen, Stefan and a few other students of the Gymnasium started a literary journal called Rosen und Disteln (\\"Roses and Thistles\\"). In this magazine, George published his first poems under the pseudonym Edmund Delorme. Even though the Gymnasium emphasised the poetry of the German Romantics, George's first poems consisted of literary translations and imitations of Italian poets, such as Petrarch and Torquato Tasso. George taught himself Italian, in order to read and translate the Renaissance poets whom he revered. Michael and Erika Metzger (1972), Stefan George, Twayne's World Authors Series. Page 15. =Travelling= When his schooling was concluded in 1888, it was clear to Stefan and to his family that it would not work for him to follow the usual course into the university, business, or the German civil service. Instead, Stefan began to travel. Michael and Erika Metzger (1972), Stefan George, Twayne's World Authors Series. Pages 17-18. He later told a friend, \\"Germany was intolerable then; just think of Nietzsche! I would have thrown a bomb if they had kept me here; or I would have perished like Nietzsche. My father was glad to get rid of me, for he sensed the danger.\\" Michael and Erika Metzger (1972), Stefan George, Twayne's World Authors Series. Page 18. He spent time in London and in Paris, where he was among the writers and artists who attended the Tuesday soir√©es held by the poet St√©phane Mallarm√©. His early travels also included Vienna, where during 1891 he met, for the first time, Hugo von Hofmannsthal. George began to publish poetry during the 1890s, while in his twenties. He initiated and edited a literary magazine named ', and was the main person of the literary and academic group known as the George-Kreis (\\"George-Circle\\"), which included some of the major, young writers of the time such as Friedrich Gundolf and Ludwig Klages. In addition to sharing cultural interests, the group promoted mystical and political themes. George knew and befriended the \\"Bohemian Countess\\" of Schwabing, Fanny zu Reventlow, who sometimes satirised the group for its melodramatic actions and opinions. George and his writings were identified with the Conservative Revolutionary philosophy. He was homosexual, yet exhorted his young friends to have a celibate life like his own.Boehringer, Robert. Mein Bild von Stefan George. M√ºnchen, D√ºsseldorf: Helmut K√ºpper vormals Georg Bondi Verlag, 1967. pp. 126‚Äì127Thomas Karlauf: Stefan George. Die Entdeckung des Charisma. Blessing, M√ºnchen 2007. During 1914, at the start of the World War, George foretold a sad end for Germany, and between then and 1916 wrote the pessimistic poem \\" Der Krieg\\" (\\"The War\\"). The outcome of the war was the realization of his worst fears. In the 1920s, George despised the culture of Germany, particularly its bourgeois mentality and archaic church rites. He wished to create a new, noble German culture, and offered \\"form\\", regarded as a mental discipline and a guide to relationships with others, as an ideal while Germany was in a period of social, political, spiritual and artistic decadence. George's poetry was discovered by the small but ascendant Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP), a precursor to Nazism, which had its roots in Bavaria. George's concepts of \\"the thousand year Reich\\" and \\"fire of the blood\\" were adopted by the NSDAP and incorporated into the party's propaganda. George would come to detest their racial theories, especially the notion of the ‚ÄúNordic superman‚Äù. After the assumption of power by the Nazis in 1933, Joseph Goebbels offered him the presidency of a new academy for the arts, which he refused. He also stayed away from celebrations prepared for his 65th birthday in July 1933. Instead he travelled to Switzerland, where he died near Locarno on 4 December 1933. After his death, his body was interred before a delegation from the German government could attend the ceremony.Robert E. Norton, Secret Germany: Stefan George and his Circle (Cornell University Press, 2002) Work George's poetry is characterized by an aristocratic ethos; his verse is formal in style, lyrical in tone, and often arcane in language, being influenced by Greek classical forms, in revolt against the realist trend of German literature at the time. Believing that the purpose of poetry was an alternate to realityhe was a strong advocate of art for art's sakeGeorge's products had many similarities with the French Symbolist style and he was in communication with many of its representatives, including St√©phane Mallarm√© and Paul Verlaine. George was an important intermediary between the 19th century and German modernism, even though he was a harsh critic of the then modern era. He experimented with various poetic metres, punctuation, obscure allusions and typography. George's \\"evident homosexuality\\"Robert E. Norton, Secret Germany: Stefan George and his Circle (Cornell University Press, 2002) page 354 is represented by works such as Algabal and the love poetry he devoted to a gifted adolescent of his acquaintance named Maximilian Kronberger,. whom he called \\"Maximin\\", and whom he believed to be a manifestation of the divine. The relevance of George's sexuality to his poetic work has been discussed by contemporary critics, such as Thomas Karlauf and Marita Keilson-Lauritz.See for example, Marita Keilson- Lauritz, \\"Ubergeschlechtliche Liebe: Stefan George's Concept of Love\\" (Rieckmann, ed A Companion to the Works of Stefan George (Camden House, 2005) Algabal is one of George's best remembered collections of poetry, if also one of his strangest; the title is a reference to the effete Roman emperor Elagabalus. George was also an important translator; he translated Dante, Shakespeare and Baudelaire into German. George was awarded the Goethe Prize during 1927. =Das neue Reich= George's last complete book of poems, Das neue Reich (\\"The New Realm\\"), was published in 1928. It was banned in Occupied Germany after World War II, as the title sounded tainted by Nazism. But George had dedicated the work, which includes the lyric Geheimes Deutschland (\\"Secret Germany\\") written in 1922, to Berthold Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg, who, with his brother Claus, took a leading role in the 20 July plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler and overthrow the Nazi Party. Both brothers, who were executed after the plot failed, had considered themselves to be acting on the teachings of the George-Circle by trying to kill Hitler.Herbert Ammon: Vom Geist Georges zur Tat Stauffenbergs - Manfred Riedels Rettung des Reiches, in: Iablis 2007 at www.iablis.de The book describes a new form of society ruled by a hierarchical spiritual aristocracy. George rejected all attempts to use it for mundane political purposes, including those of National Socialism. Influence George thought of himself as the messiah of a new kingdom that would be governed by intellectual and artistic elites, bonded by their faithfulness to a commander. In his memoirs, Albert Speer claims to have seen George during the early 1920s and that his elder brother, Hermann, was an acquaintance of his: George \\"radiated dignity and pride and a kind of priestliness... there was something magnetic about him.\\" His poetry emphasized self-sacrifice, heroism, and power, which won him the approval of the National Socialists. Though many Nazis claimed George as an influence, George remained aloof from such associations. Soon after the Nazi seizure of power, George left Germany for Switzerland where he died the same year. Some of the members of the 20 July plot against Hitler were drawn from among his devotees, notably the Stauffenberg brothers who were introduced to George by the poet and classical scholar Albrecht von Blumenthal. Although some members of the George circle were explicitly anti-semitic (for example, Klages), it also included Jewish authors such as Gundolf, the historian Ernst Kantorowicz, and the Zionist Karl Wolfskehl, as well as Erich Berger who introduced von Blumenthal. George was fond of his Jewish disciples, but he expressed reservations about their ever becoming a majority in the group. George's influence on Kantorowicz was decisive in the latter's publication of his controversial study of Emperor Frederick II in 1927. The book's account of Frederick II and his \\"dynamic personality and ability to shape the Empire according to a higher vision seemed to sum up the aspirations of the George circle.\\" George is even reported to have \\"carefully corrected\\" the manuscript and saw that it was published. One of George's most well known collaborators was Hugo von Hofmannsthal, a leading literary modernist in Austria. Hofmannsthal, however, refused membership in the group. Later in life, Hofmannsthal wrote that no one had influenced him more than George. Those closest to the \\"Master,\\" as George had his disciples call him, included several members of the 20 July plot to assassinate Hitler, among them Claus von Stauffenberg himself. Stauffenberg frequently quoted George's poem Der Widerchrist (The Anti-Christ) to his fellow members of the 20 July plot.Joachim Fest, Plotting Hitler's Death: The Story of the German Resistance, Metropolitan Books, 1994. Page 216. George's poetry was a major influence on the music of the Second Viennese School of composers, particularly during their Expressionist period. Arnold Schoenberg set George's poetry in such works as \\"Ich darf nicht dankend\\", Op. 14/1 (1907), String Quartet No. 2, Op. 10 (1908), and The Book of the Hanging Gardens, Op. 15 (1909), while his student Anton Webern made use of George's verse for his early choral work Entflieht auf leichten K√§hnen, Op. 2, as well as in two sets of songs, Opp. 3 and 4 of 1909, and in several posthumously published vocal works from the same period. In popular culture In Rainer Werner Fassbinder's 1976 movie Satansbraten the protagonist Walter Kranz attempts to model his life on that of George.

The American edition of the book was published by Alfred A. Knopf. Background Amartya Sen was the winner of the 1998 Nobel Prize in Economics. Development as Freedom was published one year later and argues that development entails a set of linked freedoms: *political freedoms and transparency in relations between people *freedom of opportunity, including freedom to access credit; and *economic protection from abject poverty, including through income supplements and unemployment relief. Poverty is characterized by lack of at least one freedom (Sen uses the term unfreedom for lack of freedom), including a de facto lack of political rights and choice, vulnerability to coercive relations, and exclusion from economic choices and protections. Based on these ethical considerations, Sen argues that development cannot be reduced to simply increasing basic incomes, nor to rising average per capita incomes. Rather, it requires a package of overlapping mechanisms that progressively enable the exercise of a growing range of freedoms. A central idea of the book is that freedom is both the end and a means to development. Canadian social scientist Lars Osberg wrote about the book: \\"Although Development as Freedom covers immense territory, it is subtle and nuanced and its careful scholarship is manifest at every turn.\\" Kenneth Arrow concluded \\"In this book, Amartya Sen develops elegantly, compactly, and yet broadly the concept that economic development is in its nature an increase in freedom.\\" See also *Equality of autonomy *Human development theory References  Further reading   Pdf version. * Category:1999 non-fiction books Category:Books by Amartya Sen Category:Development economics Category:English-language books Category:International development ","title":"Development as Freedom"},{"id":"549892","text":"Geographic Resources Analysis Support System (commonly termed GRASS GIS) is a geographic information system (GIS) software suite used for geospatial data management and analysis, image processing, producing graphics and maps, spatial and temporal modeling, and visualizing. It can handle raster, topological vector, image processing, and graphic data. GRASS GIS contains over 350 modules to render maps and images on monitor and paper; manipulate raster and vector data including vector networks; process multispectral image data; and create, manage, and store spatial data. It is licensed and released as free and open-source software under the GNU General Public License (GPL). It runs on multiple operating systems, including , Windows and Linux. Users can interface with the software features through a graphical user interface (GUI) or by plugging into GRASS via other software such as QGIS. They can also interface with the modules directly through a bespoke shell that the application launches or by calling individual modules directly from a standard shell. The latest stable release version (LTS) is GRASS GIS 7, which is available since 2015 The GRASS Development Team is a multinational group consisting of developers at many locations. GRASS is one of the eight initial Software Projects of the Open Source Geospatial Foundation. Architecture GRASS supports raster and vector data in two and three dimensions. The vector data model is topological, meaning that areas are defined by boundaries and centroids; boundaries cannot overlap within one layer. In contrast, OpenGIS Simple Features, defines vectors more freely, much as a non-georeferenced vector illustration program does. GRASS is designed as an environment in which tools that perform specific GIS computations are executed. Unlike GUI-based application software, the GRASS user is presented with a Unix shell containing a modified environment that supports execution of GRASS commands, termed modules. The environment has a state that includes parameters such as the geographic region covered and the map projection in use. All GRASS modules read this state and additionally are given specific parameters (such as input and output maps, or values to use in a computation) when executed. Most GRASS modules and abilities can be operated via a graphical user interface (provided by a GRASS module), as an alternative to manipulating geographic data in a shell. The GRASS distribution includes over 350 core modules. Over 100 add-on modules created by users are offered on its website. The libraries and core modules are written in C. Other modules are written in C, C++, Python, Unix shell, Tcl, or other scripting languages. The modules are designed under the Unix philosophy and hence can be combined using Python or shell scripting to build more complex or specialized modules, by users, without knowledge of C programming. There is cooperation between the GRASS and Quantum GIS (QGIS) projects. Recent versions of QGIS can be executed within the GRASS environment, allowing QGIS to be used as a user-friendly graphical interface to GRASS that more closely resembles other graphical GIS software than does the shell-based GRASS interface. Another project exists to re-implement GRASS in Java as JGRASS. History GRASS has been under continuous development since 1982 and has involved a large number of federal US agencies, universities, and private companies. The core components of GRASS and the management of integration of efforts into its releases was originally directed by the U.S. Army - Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (USA-CERL), a branch of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, in Champaign, Illinois. USA-CERL completed its last release of GRASS as version 4.1 in 1992, and provided five updates and patches to this release through 1995. USA-CERL also wrote the core components of the GRASS 5.0 floating point version. The development of GRASS was started by the USA-CERL to meet the need of the United States military for software for land management and environmental planning. A key motive was the National Environmental Policy Act. The development platform was Unix running on VAX hardware. During 1982 through 1995, USA-CERL led the development of GRASS, with the involvement of many others, including universities and other federal agencies. USA-CERL officially ceased its involvement in GRASS after release 4.1 (1995), though development had been limited to minor patches since 1993. A group formed at Baylor University to take over the software, releasing GRASS 4.2. Around this time, a port of the software to Linux was made. In 1998, Markus Neteler, the current project leader, announced the release of GRASS 4.2.1, which offered major improvements including a new graphical user interface. In October 1999, the license of the originally public domain software GRASS software was changed to the GNU GPL in version 5.0.GRASS Development Team. GRASS History. Retrieved on 2008-03-29. Since then, GRASS has evolved into a powerful software suite with a wide range of applications in many different areas of scientific research and engineering.

It was created by Eric Solomon. The board game was published by Waddingtons from the mid-1970s and by Parker Brothers in the late 1970s. The game can also be played with pen and paper, and there are numerous computer implementations for many different platforms, including one which can be run from the Emacs text editor. Black Box was inspired by the work of Godfrey Hounsfield who was awarded the 1979 Nobel Prize in Medicine for his invention of the CAT scanner. Objective Black Box is played on a two-dimensional grid. The object of the game is to discover the location of objects (\\"atoms\\", represented by metal balls in the Waddingtons game and by yellow balls in the Parker Brothers version) hidden within the grid, by the use of the minimum number of probes (\\"rays\\"). The atoms are hidden by a person in a two-player game. In a solitaire game, they are either hidden by a computer or they are pre-hidden; in this case, the results of various probes are resolved by looking them up in a book. The seeker designates where the ray enters the black box and the hider (or computer or book) announces the result (a \\"hit\\", \\"reflection\\", or \\"detour\\"/\\"miss\\"). This result is marked by the seeker, who uses these to deduce the position of the atoms in the black box. Rules 250px The most common configuration for novice players is four atoms in an 8√ó8 grid. At left is a sample black box in this configuration. There are 32 input positions in an 8√ó8 grid, eight each at the top, bottom, right, and left. A beam is \\"fired\\" into one of these positions and the result is used to help deduce the location of a known number of hidden atoms. 250px =Hit= Atoms interact with rays in three ways. A direct impact on an atom by a ray is a \\"hit\\". Thus, ray 1 fired into the box configuration at left strikes an atom directly, generating a \\"hit\\", designated by an \\"H\\". A ray which hits an atom does not emerge from the box. 250px =Deflection= The interaction resulting from a ray which does not actually hit an atom, but which passes directly to one side of the ball is called a \\"deflection\\". The angle of deflection for this ray/atom interaction is 90 degrees. Ray 2 is deflected by the atom at left, exiting the box as shown. 250px =Reflection= The final type of interaction of a ray with an atom is a \\"reflection\\", designated by an \\"R\\". This occurs in two circumstances. If an atom is at the edge of the grid, any ray which is aimed into the grid directly beside it causes a reflection. Rays 3 and 4 at left would each generate a reflection, due to the atom at the edge. Ray 5 would be a hit on the atom. 250px =Double deflection= The other circumstance leading to a reflection is when two deflections cancel out. In the grid at left, ray 6 results in a reflection due to its interaction with the atoms in the grid. 250px =Miss= There are also misses. Ray 7 at left, for instance, interacts with no atoms in the grid. 250px =Detour= Rays that don't result in hits or reflections are called \\"detours\\". These may be single or multiple deflections, or misses. A detour has an entry and an exit location, while hits and reflections only have an entry location for a hit, and a single entry/exit location for a reflection. Of course, more complex situations result when these behaviors interact. Ray 8 results in two deflections, as does ray 9. 250px Some rays travel a twisted course, like ray 1 at left. 250px Notice that this complex set of five deflections above looks exactly like a single deflection, as shown by ray 2 at left. Things are not always as simple as they seem within a black box. 250px Reflections and hits can be more complex, too. Ray 2 gets deflected by the first atom, reflected by the next two atoms and again deflected by the original atom, yielding a reflection. 250px Ray 3 below gets deflected by the first atom, then by the second atom, and then hits the third atom, yielding a hit. 250px The complete set of interactions of rays with the original sample black box is shown at left. Note that for detours, the input and output locations are interchangeable - it does not matter if ray 2 below enters the box from the left side, or the top. Scoring Each entry and exit location counts as a point. Hits and reflections therefore cost one point, while detours cost two points. When the seeker guesses the location of the atoms in the grid, each misidentified atom position costs penalty points: ten in the original Waddingtons rules, five in the Parker Brothers version and most computer editions. Different atom positions lead to different average scores - a very easy four-ball game might average eight or nine points to solve, while a very hard game might average 18 points. Variants 250px The most common variant of Black Box is played on an 8√ó8 grid with five (or more) atoms. Five-atom configurations allow for positions that cannot be unambiguously determined by probes. The grid at left shows an example of this. If the fifth atom is in any of the four positions marked by the X, no ray can ever determine where it is located, because it is shielded from all directions by the surrounding atoms. The addition of more atoms allows for more complex indeterminate configurations, but also allows for more intriguing interactions. 250px It is possible to \\"hide\\" a ball with this four-atom configuration. It is not ambiguous, however. Black Box can also be played with different-sized grids, such as 10√ó10 or 12√ó12 grids. A related class of computer puzzle games feature different types of obstacles concealed in the box, which affect rays in varying ways ‚Äî such as mirrors which reflect only a direct-hit ray, or prisms which split one ray into two. The GNOME game GFingerPoken and one section of the Macintosh game System's Twilight fall into this class. Video game A version of the game was created for the BBC Micro home computer by Ben Finn (who would go on to co-write Sibelius) and submitted in the 'design a game' competition on ITV's The Saturday Show. As joint winner of the competition, the game was officially licensed from Waddingtons and published (along with fellow winner Gambit by the Oliver Twins) by Acornsoft in 1984.

It is based on the 1990 novel of the same name by British author A. S. Byatt, who won the Booker Prize for it the year it was published. Synopsis A fictional story of literary scholars American Roland Michell (Aaron Eckhart) and British Maud Bailey (Gwyneth Paltrow), who independently find that the socially antagonistic relationship between the Victorian era poets Randolph Henry Ash (Jeremy Northam) and Christabel LaMotte (Jennifer Ehle) may have concealed a secret connection as lovers. Ash is traditional and conservative and LaMotte is a freethinking bisexual. Rival scholars become aware of their efforts and each seeks to be the first at the public disclosure of this major finding about the poets. In a parallel relationship, Michell and Bailey have their own deepening connection. Cast * Aaron Eckhart as Roland Michell * Gwyneth Paltrow as Maud Bailey * Jeremy Northam as Randolph Henry Ash * Jennifer Ehle as Christabel LaMotte * Lena Headey as Blanche Glover * Holly Aird as Ellen Ash * Toby Stephens as Fergus Wolfe * Tom Hollander as Euan * Trevor Eve as Cropper Development Three early drafts of the film's screenplay were written by American playwright David Henry Hwang in the 1990s, but the project languished in pre-production for years. Directors such as Sydney Pollack and Gillian Armstrong worked on the film and eventually gave up before LaBute became director. LaBute made drastic changes to the story, based partially on notes that original author Byatt had made on earlier drafts of the screenplay, as she recognized that Roland Michell had to \\"exist on screen\\" in a different way than he did in the book. LaBute recalled: LaBute changed Roland's nationality from British to American, and made him more brash and active. He denied that this was \\"shameless pandering to the audience. ... in part, it was [just] more comfortable for me to write Roland that way.\\" Casting Ralph Fiennes was approached for the role as Randolph Ash that eventually went to Jeremy Northam. Reception Daniel Zalewski of The New York Times noted that director LaBute, \\"known for savagely blunt stage and screen dramas ... has here infused a British novelist's main characters with the same stutter-and-slang rhythms, male-bonding repart√©e and sarcastic volleys that define his own distinctly American work.\\" He said, \\"In the end, Mr. LaBute's grafting of his own sensibility onto Roland creates a weird tonal clash.\\" Jamie Russell of the BBC said, \\"Lacking the intelligence of an arthouse picture, or the classy sheen of a British production, \\"Possession\\" isn't possessed of anything other than over-wrought emotionalism and unintentional silliness.\\"Jamie Russell, \\"Possession\\", BBC, 20 October 2002 Rob Gonsalves said, \\"Possession is a dual-track exploration of romantic mores then and now ...

The line mainly carried milk from dairies in the region, acting as a feeder to the system. It also provided passenger services to the small villages and beauty spots along its route. The line was built to a narrow gauge and to the light rail standards provided by the Light Railways Act 1896 to reduce construction costs. The route of the line is now a foot- and cycle- path.  Route  The North Staffordshire Railway's branch from Leek ended at Waterhouses (). The L&MVLR; continued from an end-on junction with this line. It ran for down the valley of the River Hamps as far as Beeston Tor, before turning up the limestone gorge that the River Manifold had formed, through to Hulme End (). The line had a large number of stations in a relatively short distance, and there were refreshment rooms at Thor's Cave and Beeston Tor. In all the line crossed the river Manifold dozens of times - including nine times in the short section between Sparrowlee and Beeston Tor. All stations had rather grand signs (sometimes grander than the facilities) and platforms were just high. All stations had sidings except for Beeston Tor and Redhurst Halt. * Hulme End station was a large building, with adjacent engine and coach sheds (two roads in each). On the timetable it was described as \\"Hulme End for Hartington\\". Hartington being some distant. * Ecton station had both a standard gauge and narrow gauge siding, with a narrow gauge extension to the milk factory. The presence of the railway did not kick-start the local mining industry, as hoped. * Butterton station (also known locally as Ecton Lea) had a waiting room. There was a siding. * Wetton Mill station had a station with waiting room, and a standard gauge siding. (It had ceased to be a working mill before the railway was built.) * At Redhurst Halt an old coach served as a waiting room. There was no siding here. * Thor's Cave station largely served Wetton village. It had a waiting room. Its refreshment room was moved to Wetton in 1917. * Grindon station, located at Weags Bridge, had a loop containing a standard gauge siding. * Beeston Tor station had no siding, but a refreshment room. * Sparrowlee station served Lee House Farm, but nowhere else, and there was not even a waiting room here. The siding included a standard gauge section. * At Waterhouses station the platform had booking offices, and there was a goods shed. There were two short loops, and three short sidings which joined with standard gauge lines. (A road-widening scheme in the 1960s has subsequently removed much of the evidence.)  History  A timetable poster of 1904, now framed in the old station at Hulme End A typical view - looking south along the route today, near Wetton Another typical view - looking north from the same viewpoint Swainsley tunnel, viewed from the southern portal, is now used by single file road traffic. Hulme End station (left) is now a visitor centre. On the right is the rebuilt former engine shed; built to resemble the original, a small part of the original framework exists inside. Authorised in 1898, this was the narrow gauge section of the Leek Light Railways. The railway ran for 30 years, from 1904 to 1934. Its engineer was Everard Calthrop, a leading advocate of narrow gauge railways and builder of the Barsi Light Railway in India; the chairman of the company was Charles Bill, MP for Leek. A private concern, it was run by the North Staffordshire Railway on a percentage basis, but it later came under the control of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923. The line was constructed to a high standard, Calthrop applying lessons learned on his other railways. Rail used was 35 lb/yard (17.28 kg/m), and the quality of trackwork is reflected in the fact that no re-laying was ever necessary. The line was a single track, and most services (which began from Hulme End, where the locomotive sheds were) only involved the use of one engine in steam. There was passing loop at Wetton Mill, but it was never used as such. At Waterhouses the timetable allowed for connections from Leek. Trains ran at a maximum speed of , and most halts were run on a request basis. More than this, the train would also often stop to pick up passengers at other places on the lineside footpath, if requested. Timetables mostly show single journey times of 50 minutes (with some showing an hour). Most outbound freight consisted of milk, in both churns and bulk tankers, and the products of the dairy goods factory at Ecton. In all, some 300 milk churns were handled daily at Waterhouses, and from 1919 a daily milk train ran from Waterhouses to London specifically for this traffic. Latterly milk tanks were used, carried on the transporter wagons. Passenger traffic was minimal ‚Äì the settlements were mostly some distance from the line ‚Äì except on Bank Holidays when all the line's rolling stock was used to run frequent services to handle the crowds. There was some talk of extending the line northwards, whereby Hulme End (and its engine shed) would become the half-way point of the line, but this never materialised. The railway was filmed in operation for Path√© News in 1930 under the title \\"A quaint little Railway\\".  Locomotives and rolling stock  The company only had two locomotives: outside-cylindered 2-6-4Ts, built by Kitson & Co. of Leeds in 1904, which were the first 2-6-4T locomotives to run in Britain - the first standard gauge examples being the Great Central Railway's Class 1B of 1914. Number 1 was named E.R. Calthrop, after the line's engineer, and number 2 was named J.B. Earle (the resident engineer). Due to the influence of Calthrop, the locomotives had a somewhat colonial appearance with large headlights which were never used. They also had fittings for cow catchers - again never fitted, and they sported rerailing jacks by the smokebox. The locos were originally painted brown with gold and black lining, after the grouping replaced by crimson lake with gold and black lining. Latterly, after the Great Depression had set in, they ran in plain black. There was no turntable on the line, and engines ran chimney first towards Waterhouses, despite initial concerns (usually engines on a gradient run the other way, to keep the water over the firebox crown) about the steeper down section (1 in 40) out of Waterhouses. In latter years E.R. Calthrop returned from repairs in Crewe facing the other way, as can be seen in later photographs. There were four coaches; two first class and two brake composite thirds. These were originally painted primrose yellow, and later repainted in LMS Midland red. Freight wagons consisted of one box van and two open wagons. These open wagons were built by the Leeds Forge Company and were largely designed for the transport of loose milk churns. Additionally there were also five (four short and one long) transporter wagons, technically \\"low side bogie goods wagons\\". These were supplied by the Cravens Railway Carriage & Wagon Company at a cost of ¬£315 each. Uniquely in Britain, in a piggy-back style these were capable of carrying standard gauge wagons - particularly milk tankers and coal wagons - to standard gauge sidings along the route. However, the extra height and width of the loading gauge caused by this arrangement (such as seen in the dimensions of Swainsley Tunnel) undid some of the benefits of using a narrow gauge. This arrangement also meant that standard gauge lengths of track (on sidings) had to be constructed level with the rails of the low transporters.  Frequency of service  Trains started and finished at Hulme End, at the northern end of the line, where the engine sheds were located. After opening, there were initially three trains daily in each direction. This increased to four on Thursdays and Saturdays (and later to five). After an attempt by the North Staffordshire Railway as early as 1904 to reduce the service during the winter months to a service only on Wednesdays and Saturdays, the Manifold Company secured an agreement that there should be a minimum of two trains in each direction throughout the year. On Bank Holidays there were some seven trains daily, and at peak times both engines and all carriages/wagons would be in use - planks and awnings were placed on the open wagons to make them usable by passengers, albeit rather rudimentary. It is recorded that in Whit Week in 1905 some 5000 passengers were carried, and the most intensive service saw trains operating from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday services began in 1905, but stopped in 1930, thus losing much tourist revenue. The most important traffic on the line was from the Express Dairies creamery at Ecton. Most of the product was destined via dedicated milk trains for London. In 1911 were brought in from the L&MVLR; growing to in 1922. Initially all the milk was carried in milk churns, which had to be manhandled across the platforms at Waterhouses. But after the First World War the churns were loaded into standard gauge vans taken to and from Ecton on the transporter wagons. Eventually milk tankers were also used, again being transferred between Ecton and Waterhouses on the transporters. The importance of the milk traffic was such that between 1919 and 1926, special milk trains ran direct between Waterhouses and London, rather than the vans being shunted between various trains until the milk reached its ultimate destination. The year after the closure of the creamery in 1933, the L&MVLR; closed.  Closure  manufacturer's plate dated 1904 from J.B.Earle displayed in the museum at Tywyn on the Talyllyn Railway In 1932 Express Dairies closed its Ecton creamery, concentrating on its new Rowsley creamery, re-routing milk collection in the area to road transport. The loss of this milk trade removed most of the goods traffic from the line. Furthermore, the developing motor bus services served the villages much better, these settlements being largely on the hills, and often some distance from the line itself. The railway closed briefly in consequence, to re-open briefly in 1933, but closed finally to all traffic on Monday 10 March 1934. J.B.Earle was cut up at the LMSR Crewe railway works, whilst E.R. Calthrop was used in the track-removal train, which worked south from Hulme End, before being itself cut up at Waterhouses. All that remains of the engines are three name plates.  The line today ‚Äì The Manifold Way  The Manifold Valley footpath and cycle way (now called the Manifold Way) was opened in July 1937 after the LMS handed over the trackbed to Staffordshire County Council. It continues on to Waterhouses, via Hulme End, as a bridle path, and, being tarmacked throughout, is ideal for wheelchair users, prams, etc. For about , near Wetton Mill, the route is shared with motor traffic where the C-road has been diverted, and this section includes Swainsley tunnel, built by Sir Thomas Wardle who, despite being a shareholder in the railway, did not want to see it crossing his land. Some spectacular scenery can be found along the route, including Thor's Cave, Wetton Hill and Beeston Tor. Many consider that this section bears comparison with the better-known Dovedale a few miles to the east. (The National Trust own several of these sites, as part of their South Peak Estate.) The Old Light Railway Hotel at Hulme End is now called the Manifold Inn. There are campsites at Hulme End and Wetton Village. At Ecton Hill a 4,000-year-old copper mine lies along the route; there is still evidence of the railway's loading platforms along the route of the old railway. A dairy once stood here and one can still see where milk churns were once loaded onto the morning milk train. The Ecton dairy was famous for its Stilton cheese. The old engine shed at Hulme End opened as a cafe called The Tea Junction in 2010.  Modelling  Slater's Plasticard produce an O16.5 scale kit of the locomotives, with Dorset Kits offering brass coach construction kits together with etched brass kits for both long and short transporter wagons, the open bogie wagons and the bogie van to match in this scale. These can all be built to run on the correct 17.5mm track. PortWynnstay models of Derby offer a resin outline of the short wheelbase transport car/wagon. Meridian Models recently produced an (009) scale locomotive body in white metal to fit on a (Minitrix) chassis and Worsley Works produce a basic scratch kit for the carriages, requiring addition of bogies (where applicable), couplings, door handles, and interior to complete. A third company has apparently produced the transporter cars/wagons in this scale. Roundhouse has produced a live steam model in 1:19 scale, (16mm/foot), of the Kitson 2-6-4 locomotive in the NSR livery. There is a model at the visitors' centre in Hulme End along one wall inside the former station building. This shows a representation of Hulme End station, yard and nearby buildings in (009) scale with a short run (scaled down distance) to a model of Butterton station.

It was later ported to the Sega Mega Drive. While the game is essentially a standard horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up, it has an innovation that makes it unique in the genre. The player flies a spaceship (specifically, a bioship) which has the standard forward guns to be found in all horizontal scrollers, but it also possesses a weapon that can be manually targeted with a crosshair, in the same manner as in the game Missile Command. This allows the player to fire in any direction with pinpoint accuracy, and adds an extra level of strategy to the game. The game saw an almost arcade perfect port on the Sega Mega Drive. What few changes there were actually enhanced the look of the game such as added parallax scrolling backgrounds in level 2. Story Taking place on the planet Atlantal, a huge battleship and space fleet suddenly appears and attacks Atlantal's largest city, Delila, leaving the city in ruins. The fleet, known only as The Aggressors, continue to spread throughout the planet and further into the galaxy, past the Galegino Path, the sea of flames. To drive out and stop The Aggressors, the best twin- seat space fighter on the planet - the Paladin - is sent out; a powerful bioship that can grow larger in strength and size. The Aggressors are suggested to have come from Earth as the enemies, bosses all have vehicle names of different languages and many of the bosses are actually named after alcoholic drinks. Gameplay A player engaging in battle in the Mega Drive version. The Paladin had a variety of offenses. Unlike most shoot 'em ups, the Paladin actually had an armor gauge, meaning that the ship would not be destroyed with one hit or after brushing up against a foreground object. The ship had a semi-automatic Laser weapon that, when held down, would charge up and unleash a stronger laser blast. The ship also had the Beam weapon. Once selected, players could use a manual aiming crosshair that could be placed anywhere on the screen, allowing the player to shoot any visible enemy fighter. The player or players had to fight through nine levels filled with clever foreground obstacles and slews of enemies. Many of the bosses had to be destroyed by first shooting off their guns, missile launchers and jets before destroying the whole ship. However, there were no Extend bonuses.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Bio-ship Paladin on their December 15, 1990 issue as being the eleventh most-successful table arcade unit of the year.

It stars Jack Nicholson, Art Garfunkel, Ann- Margret, Candice Bergen, and Rita Moreno. Plot The story follows the sexual exploits of two Amherst College roommates over a 25-year period, from the late 1940s to the early 1970s. Sandy (Art Garfunkel) is gentle and passive, while Jonathan Fuerst (Jack Nicholson) is tough and aggressive. Sandy idolizes women, while Jonathan objectifies them. He frequently uses the term \\"ballbuster\\" to describe women as emasculating teases whose main pleasure is to deny pleasure to men; he extends this term to mean women who want to get married instead of accepting that men mostly want unattached sex. Since each man's perspective of womanhood is extreme and self-serving, neither is able to sustain a relationship with a woman. The film has three parts. Part I occurs when Sandy and Jonathan are college roommates. Part II follows the men several years after college. In the final part, the men have become middle-aged. In the beginning, Sandy and Jonathan are discussing women, and what kind appeals to each. Sandy wants a woman who is intellectual. Jonathan is more interested in a woman's physical attributes. Sandy shyly meets Susan (Candice Bergen) at an on-campus event and they begin dating. Although they enjoy each other's company, Susan is reluctant to enter into a physical relationship. Unbeknownst to Sandy, she is pursued by Jonathan, who feels a physical attraction for her. They have sex. Jonathan tries to persuade Susan not to have sex with Sandy, but after some delays, Susan is also having sex with Sandy. Part I ends with Susan and Jonathan breaking up. Part II finds Sandy married to Susan, while Jonathan is still searching for his \\"perfect woman.\\" Jonathan now defines perfection by a woman's bust size and figure. Jonathan begins a relationship with Bobbie (Ann-Margret), a beautiful woman who fulfills all of his physical requirements. However, Jonathan constantly berates Bobbie for being shallow. Jonathan finds that this purely physical relationship is no more satisfying than his previous relationship with Susan. Bobbie leaves her job at Jonathan's suggestion. She then becomes depressed, spending long hours doing nothing but sleeping in the apartment she shares with Jonathan. The relationship deteriorates. Jonathan berates Bobbie for not cleaning up the apartment while he is out working a nine-to-five job all day. He claims that he doesn't understand why breakups always have to end with \\"poison.\\" Sandy's relationship with Susan is faring no better. Sandy is dissatisfied and bored with the physical part of their relationship, even though he and Susan \\"do all the right things.\\" He relates how they are \\"patient with each other\\" and concludes with a statement that perhaps sex is not \\"meant to be enjoyable with a person you love.\\" He says that being in bed with Susan as she tells him what to do is like taking orders at a short-order grill. Sandy and Susan end their relationship. He begins dating Cindy (Cynthia O'Neal) next. Sandy, Cindy, Jonathan, and Bobbie find themselves together at Jonathan's apartment, where Jonathan suggests privately to Sandy that they trade partners, to \\"liven things up a bit.\\" Sandy goes to the bedroom looking for Bobbie. Cindy dances with Jonathan and reprimands him for attempting to bed her with Sandy nearby, but indicates she is open to seeing him on his own, saying he should contact her at a more appropriate time. In the meantime, upset by an earlier fight with Jonathan about her desire to get married, Bobbie has attempted suicide. She is found by Sandy, who calls the hospital to have her taken to intensive care. Part III opens with now-middle-aged Jonathan presenting a slideshow entitled \\"Ballbusters on Parade\\" to Sandy (also middle-aged) and his 18-year- old girlfriend, Jennifer (Carol Kane). The slideshow consists of pictures of Jonathan's various loves throughout his life. He skips awkwardly over a slide of Susan, but not before Sandy notices. He also shows an image of Bobbie, saying they are divorced and had one child together, and he is paying her alimony. Jennifer leaves in tears. Sandy idolizes his new lover, explaining that \\"she knows worlds which I cannot begin to touch yet.\\" Jonathan believes his friend is deluding himself. Time passes. Jonathan remains successful, but is alone. A prostitute (Rita Moreno) is with him, and they go through a ritual dialogue about male/female relationships which is apparently a script written by Jonathan. At the end, the prostitute recites a monologue (again scripted by Jonathan) praising his power and \\"perfection,\\" which apparently has become the only way Jonathan can now get an erection. Cast * Jack Nicholson as Jonathan Fuerst * Arthur Garfunkel as Sandy * Candice Bergen as Susan * Ann- Margret as Bobbie * Rita Moreno as Louise * Carol Kane as Jennifer * Cynthia O'Neal as Cindy Production The script was originally written as a play. Jules Feiffer sent it to Mike Nichols, who thought it would work better as a film.Nichols Meets Jules Feiffer: Mike Nichols The script contains numerous curse words, some of which were rarely heard on the screen before this time. The $5 million budget was provided by Joseph E. Levine of which $1 million went to Nichols. The movie was shot in Vancouver. Legal problems The changes in the morals of American society of the 1960s and 1970s and the general receptiveness by the public to frank discussion of sexual issues was sometimes at odds with local community standards. A theatre in Albany, Georgia, showed the film. On January 13, 1972, the local police served a search warrant on the theatre, and seized the film. In March 1972, the theatre manager, Mr. Jenkins, was convicted of the crime of \\"distributing obscene material\\". His conviction was upheld by the Supreme Court of Georgia. On June 24, 1974, the U.S. Supreme Court found that the State of Georgia had gone too far in classifying material as obscene in view of its prior decision in Miller v. California, (the Miller standard), and overturned the conviction in Jenkins v. Georgia, . The court also said that, Reception =Critical response= Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four stars out of four and called it \\"clearly Mike Nichols' best film. It sets out to tell us certain things about these few characters and their sexual crucifixions, and it succeeds. It doesn't go for cheap or facile laughs, or inappropriate symbolism, or a phony kind of contemporary feeling ... Nicholson, who is possibly the most interesting new movie actor since James Dean, carries the film, and his scenes with Ann-Margret are masterfully played.\\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times was also positive, calling it \\"a nearly ideal collaboration of directorial and writing talents\\" that was \\"not only very funny, but in a casual way‚Äîin the way of something observed in a half- light‚Äîmore profound than much more ambitious films.\\"Canby, Vincent (July 1, 1971). \\"Film: 'Carnal Knowledge'\\".

Gary Arnold of The Washington Post wrote, \\"I wouldn't mind having a nickel for every moviegoer who walks out of 'Carnal Knowledge' feeling cheated and despondent.

Pauline Kael of The New Yorker wrote, \\"This movie says not merely that there are some people like these, but that this is it‚Äîthat is, that this movie, in its own satirical terms, presents a more accurate view of men and women than conventional movies do. That may be the case, but the movie isn't convincing.\\"Kael, Pauline (July 3, 1971). \\"The Current Cinema\\". The New Yorker. 44. Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively gives the film a score of 87% based on reviews from 30 critics, with an average rating of 7.72/10.

After the succession of Ecgfrith as king of Northumbria in 670, he made √Ülfwine king of the sub-kingdom of Deira. √Ülfwine was still a boy at the time, and the title may have been intended to designate him as the heir of the childless Ecgfrith.

Although his death could have led to an escalation of the war, further conflict was averted by the intervention of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Theodore, and King √Üthelred of Mercia paid a weregild to Ecgfrith in compensation for √Ülfwine's death. Bede writes: ‚ÄúIn the ninth year of the reign of King Ecgfrith (in 679), a great battle was fought between him and √Üthelred, king of the Mercians, near the river Trent, and √Ülfwine, brother to King Ecgfrith, was slain, a youth about eighteen years of age, and much beloved by both provinces; for King √Üthelred had married his sister Osthryth. There was now reason to expect a more bloody war, and more lasting enmity between those kings and their fierce nations; but Theodore, the bishop, beloved of God, relying on the Divine aid, by his wholesome admonitions wholly extinguished the dangerous fire that was breaking out; so that the kings and their people on both sides were appeased, and no man was put to death, but only the due mulct paid to the king who was the avenger for the death of his brother; and this peace continued long after between those kings and between their kingdoms.‚ÄùBede, Historia ecclesiastica, Book IV, chapter 21.

The company is headquartered in Fairfax, Virginia.\\"Home\\". Trailways Transportation System. Retrieved on June 30, 2010. \\"3554 Chain Bridge Road Suite 202 Fairfax VA 22030-2709\\".  History  The predecessor to Trailways Transportation System was founded February 5, 1936, by Burlington Transportation Company, Santa Fe Trails Transportation Company, Missouri Pacific Stages, Safeway Lines, Inc., and Frank Martz Coach Company. The system originated with coast-to-coast service as the National Trailways Bus System (NTBS). Greyhound Lines had grown so quickly in the 1920s and 1930s that the Interstate Commerce Commission encouraged smaller independent operators to form the NTBS to provide competition. Unlike Greyhound, which centralized ownership, Trailways member companies became a formidable competitor while staying an association of almost 100 separate companies. In the 1950s, Morgan W. Walker, Sr., of Alexandria, Louisiana, became head of the southern division of the company. He had entered the business on a small scale during World War II as the Interurban Transportation Company of Alexandria. During the 1950s and 1960s, consolidation among bus operators resulted in four of the five original Trailways members becoming part of a new company, Continental Trailways, which eventually operated the majority of Trailways routes. In 1968, under the leadership of major stockholder Kemmons Wilson, Holiday Inn acquired Continental Trailways, which remained a subsidiary of Holiday Inn until 1979, when Holiday Inn sold Trailways to private investor Henry Lea Hillman Sr., of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In the years during which Trailways was a subsidiary of Holiday Inn, television commercials for Holiday Inn frequently showed a Trailways bus stopping at a Holiday Inn hotel. Regular route bus ridership in the United States had been declining steadily since World War II despite minor gains during the 1973 and 1979 energy crises. By 1986, the Greyhound Bus Line had been spun off from the parent company to new owners, which resulted in Greyhound Lines becoming solely a bus transportation company. It was sold off to new owners headed by Fred Currey, a former executive with the largest member of the National Trailways Bus System. The old Greyhound parent had changed its name to Dial Corporation. Under the new ownership in 1987, led by Currey, Greyhound Lines later acquired the former Continental Trailways company, the largest member of the Trailways system, effectively eliminating a large portion of bus competition. Although Greyhound negotiated cooperative schedules with Carolina Coach Company and Southeastern Trailways, two of the larger members of the Trailways system, many smaller carriers were effectively forced out of business. Greyhound later acquired Carolina and the intercity operations of Southeastern. Most of the survivors diversified into charters and tours.

It held the franchise from 29 April 1961 until 31 December 1981. After a difficult start, Westward Television provided a popular, distinctive and highly regarded service to its region, until public boardroom squabbles led to its franchise not being renewed by the IBA. Westward launched the career of many broadcasters who became well known nationally, won numerous awards for its programming, and heavily influenced its successor, TSW.  History  The company's first chairman was Peter Cadbury who had left the board of Tyne Tees Television to set up the company and bid for the south-west franchise, which he won against 11 competing bids.Obituary: Peter Cadbury, Daily Telegraph, 18 April 2006 Cadbury named the company after the golf course at Westward Ho! in north Devon, where he played. Ironically, Westward Ho! was part of the region that found reception of the television signal most difficult, until the construction of the Huntshaw Cross relay transmitter in 1968. Westward's region was surrounded on three sides by the sea, which was strongly reflected in Westward's output and its company logo, a silver model of the Golden Hind. In early January 1969, plans were drawn up for a merger between Westward and the Keith Prowse company, as Peter Cadbury was chairman of both.\\"Westward in merger discussions\\", The Guardian, Thursday, 16 January 1969, p.10 By 17 January, the deal was done. EMI purchased Keith Prowse Music Publishing from Westward in the latter part of 1969.\\"EMI: A brief history\\", BBC News, 24 January 2000. Retrieved 3 June 2013. Soon, the Westward board was in continual disagreement, and in January 1970, Cadbury was sacked, and re- hired within days as the chairman of the Westward board, after he made outspoken remarks against the levy imposed on advertising revenue imposed by the IBA\\"Mr Cadbury back as chairman of Westward TV\\", The Guardian, Friday, 30 January 1970, p.22 while also withholding a Westward corporation tax bill to the Inland Revenue over the same matter.\\"ITV company will not pay its Tax bill\\", The Guardian, Monday, 19 January 1970, p.1 By July 1980, Cadbury was finally removed from the Westward board\\"Westward oust Cadbury as head\\", The Guardian, Tuesday, 15 July 1980, p.1 and over the following six months, he tried to regain control. = Franchise loss = On 28 December 1980, while the ITV network was showing Drake's Venture (Westward Television's two-hour filmed drama to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Sir Francis Drake's circumnavigation of the globe, starring John Thaw), ITN broke into a commercial break to announce that ATV was to undergo major changes and Southern and Westward had not had their licences renewed by the IBA; the south-west franchise was awarded to TSW (Television South West). Following the loss of its franchise, Westward's management decided to sell up quickly, and the company (including its staff, premises and programme library) was purchased by TSW, early in 1981, for ¬£2.38 million. TSW continued using the Westward name and symbol on screen until 31 December 1981; thereafter, it was re-branded on screen as TSW. A special programme, 20 Years of Westward, was broadcast on 21 December 1981British Film Institute, BFI Database TX listing for 20 Years of Westward to look back on the company's achievements. It was presented by Roger Shaw, and recorded in front of a studio audience. Hastings Mann's Westward Ho!The Robert Farnon Society, original start-up theme title and composer identified was used as the theme music. Studio guests included Angela Rippon, Kenneth MacLeod and Sheila Kennedy. There were filmed contributions from Alan Freeman, Jan Leeming and David Vine and many clips of Westward programmes were shown. The special programme ended with a message from Peter Cadbury, in which he wished TSW well. = Closure = Unlike the other ITV stations that lost their franchises in this round, Westward (having been run by successor TSW since August 1981) opted to hand over at midnight on 31 December 1981. On that evening they broadcast the first 25 minutes of Scottish Television's Hogmanay show live, and then cut away just before midnight when Roger Shaw appeared on-camera in a traditional dinner jacket seated at an antique wooden desk, surrounded by staff wearing formal suits and holding film reels and 2-inch videotapes. He closed Westward Television with this announcement: =Launch of TSW= TSW then began with a short video clip of a champagne bottle being opened accompanied by the short audio version of the station ident \\"That's Soul, Write\\". Shaw then re-appeared wearing a modern suit, (no longer in a dinner jacket) and now in a modern chair, surrounded by staff wearing TSW T-shirts and holding different tools as if it were a renovation. This was clearly to remind viewers of a new modern era as well as a new look. Shaw made the first announcement on TSW: This was followed by the full version of TSW's ident. One or both of the in-vision announcements had been pre-recorded due to the rapid change of outfits. The comedy programme was followed by further continuity, an epilogue, weather & shipping forecast and closedown - all with TSW branding. However, when the screen finally faded to black at approximately 12:40am on 1 January 1982, Shaw made a final out-of- vision courtesy announcement and managed to mention the now-defunct Westward one last time, saying 'from all the staff here at Westward - good night'. No recordings of the end of Westward Television were known to exist until 2012 (the 30th anniversary of the end of Westward), then a full video recording of the evening, including the segment of STV's wiped Hogmanay show, was recovered by the classic television organisation Kaleidoscope. Parts of the recording were featured at a Kaleidoscope eventKaleidoscope Christmas Event and Grand Charity Auction 2012 Saturday 1 December 2012 and at that year's Missing Believed Wiped at the British Film Institute.  Studios  Based at purpose- built studios at Derry's Cross in Plymouth, with a London office (sited at various locations including New Bond Street, Marble Arch and Sloane Square) and a sales office in Bristol. The Derry's Cross studios were designed by the architects Treadgold and Elsey, who had previously designed the TWW Studios at Pontcanna, Cardiff and Arno's Court, Bristol (Howett 1994). During Westward's tenure, Derry's Cross had three studios. Studio 1 was , Studio 2 was and used for news, sport and interview programmes and an announcer's studio was located beside Master control. The studios were originally fitted out by Marconi, using top of the range studio equipment. Westward engineer Peter Rodgers recalled \\"From the start, where we could afford it, we bought the best\\" (Howett 1994). By the time Westward began broadcasting Derry's Cross had cost Westward over ¬£500,000, with the company committed to spending another ¬£20,000 on the studios by April 1962. In 1981 the studios (along with the company) were purchased by TSW; in 1993 the building was sold to a firm of solicitors and converted into offices. In 2010 the buildings were demolished to make way for a new retail development.  Identity  Westward Television's corporate branding focused around the sea, and mainly used a ship emblem for their on- screen look. The first ident featured an image of a boat on the water, before replacing the image with a stylised ship image in a circle, complete with Westward legend and channel nine and twelve identifiers (representing the Stockland Hill and Caradon Hill transmitters of the time), to a tune of four chimes.Westward Television Ident from 1961 Retrieved 2 June 2013. This was replaced in the mid-1960s by a model of the Golden Hind, shot against a black background with a simple Westward caption beneath accompanied by the Holly and the Ivy tune on brass instruments.Westward Television Ident from mid 1960s Retrieved 2 June 2013. This ident was altered slightly in the late 1960s to update the font to Compacta Bold. When colour television came to the region on 22 May 1971, the Golden Hind was re-shot against a blue background with the caption altered to include a small stylised ship image in a box in the lower left corner, followed by an outlined 'Westward TV' caption, with TV in red. The tune that accompanied the colour television ident was originally a nautical fanfare on brass instruments, based on the song \\"Come Landlord Fill the Flowing Bowl\\", arranged by Paul Lewis. This formed part of a longer ident theme titled An English Overture, which was used at the start of each day's broadcasts.Westward Television Transdiffusion.org. Retrieved 2 June 2013. The short ident theme was changed around 1978 to a seven note fanfare.Westward Television Ident from 28.12.1980 Retrieved 2 June 2013. This was Westward's final ident and remained with the company until the end of the franchise. In addition to these idents, Westward used a clock contained in a curved box with both analogue and digital displays, alongside the Westward Television stylised ship logo and name. In addition to this, Westward were frequent users of in- vision continuity, with many of the stations personalities becoming well known in the region.  Programming  Westward's small size and the structure of ITV (which, at the time, deliberately made it hard for small- and medium-sized ITV companies to contribute to the network) meant it produced comparatively little output for the network. Instead, the company concentrated on regional programming. From 1968 until the end of its franchise, the ITA (later the IBA) gave Westward a target of providing 6.5 hours of new regional programming a week - a target which they always exceeded. Westward's programming schedule was always published as a magazine for the public to access. Initially, they published weekly programme listings in its own programme journal, Look Westward. The first edition cost 5d, and featured a special article by Westward board member Daphne du Maurier. Many Westward personalities, such as announcer Sheila Kennedy, also contributed articles to the magazine. As part of the 1968 franchise round, the ITA created Independent Television Publications (ITP), and Westward's weekly listings would be obliged to appear solely in the local edition of the national listings magazine TVTimes, which was published by ITP. = Local programming = Westward Television had a dual policy for its local programming: it produced a wide range of programmes of particular interest to the south west's rural and agricultural communities, whilst simultaneously producing programming designed to stimulate its audience's interest in new areas. One of the best known programmes was Treasure Hunt, a game show presented by Kenneth Horne and Keith Fordyce, among others, which ran for fourteen years, and at one stage featured Jethro as the pirate co-host.The Guardian, 1 April 2011 Keith Fordyce obituary. trieved 3 June 2013.  News and current affairs  By 1969, Westward had more than 100 correspondents across the region, reporting newsworthy local events, and eight film cameramen who would travel the region gathering footage and compiling reports. The flagship programme was Westward Diary, which began life as a regional magazine programme that broadcast three times a week (Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays) between 6:15pm and 7pm. Originally, there were three presenters - Barry Westwood, Reginald Bosanquet and Kenneth MacLeod - who rotated on a weekly basis. The regional news was contained in a separate ten- minute Westward News bulletin, broadcast every weekday at 6.05pm, which was later supplemented by afternoon and late night bulletins. Westward Diary was soon merged with Westward News, to become what was known at the time as a 'regional news magazine', and was broadcast every weekday between 6.00 pm and 6:30 pm. Kenneth MacLeod was asked to present the new nightly programme permanently. The news would be read by the duty announcer, so MacLeod's role on the Diary was not that of a newsreader, but of a presenter holding the whole package together. The nightly Westward Diary had two-halves, separated by a commercial break. The first half concentrated on the regional news, whereas the second half included other items of interest to local viewers. A number of experts would visit to present regular features: Ted Tuckerman would present a fishing spot called Tight Lines, Jon Miller (the zoologist, and also presenter of Southern Television's How!) would present a spot about nature, architect David Young would examine local architecture of interest, and Topline Broadhurst would present regular gardening spots. There was a regular spot called Help! (for charity and voluntary groups), a slot called Pick of the Post (in which viewers' letters would be read) and the popular Picture Puzzle (in which viewers had to try and guess the location shown in a photograph taken somewhere in the South West). Westward staff returned to work a few days before the end of the ITV National Strike of 1979. Kenneth MacLeod had to present Westward Diary in what looked to viewers like almost total darkness, as the union only permitted the house lights to be switched on in the studio. In the early 1970s, A Date With Danton was a stand-alone weekly programme that provided a round-up of local arts and entertainment events. This later became a spot entitled \\"What's On\\", in Friday's edition of Westward Diary. The Friday edition of Sports Desk was a stand-alone programme in the early '70's, but this too had become part of the Diary towards the end of the decade. To accommodate this, the length of Friday's edition of Diary was extended to an hour, and occasionally featured a live studio audience. Westward was one of the first ITV regions to broadcast a late evening regional news bulletin (Westward Late News).Croston, Eric (editor) Television and Radio 1976 London: Independent Broadcasting Authority, p. 134 The local weather forecast in Westward Diary (with an emphasis on specialist information for fishermen and farmers) was given by a popular local personality, Graham Danton, who presented several programmes for Westward, including Holiday Times (an events listings programme aimed at people holiday-making in the region) and Late With Danton (a consumer programme). On April Fools' Day, 1973, Westward broadcast a film about the village of Spiggot, which had boycotted decimalisation and were still using pre-decimal currency. Many viewers wrote to Westward in support of the villagers' stance, oblivious to the date the film was broadcast.  Children  An early programme for young people was Spin Along, a regional pop music programme presented by disc-jockey Alan Freeman. The first edition was broadcast on Tuesday 12 September 1961 at 6:15pm, in place of Westward Diary.Missing Episodes forum, post about Spin Along A second series began on 24 September 1962 and moved to 7pm.Tony Rees Pop Diaries, entry for Spin Along Another local music programme was Move Over Dad.

Other 60s music programmes included Pop And LeslieTony Rees Pop Diaries, entry for Pop and Leslie and The Westward Beat Competition from 1964. The Westward Beat Competition had a panel of judges that included Brian Epstein and Dick Rowe and was won by The Rustiks.Bill Covington's website about The Rustiks In 1969, Angela Rippon joined Westward from BBC South West, as a producer of children's and women's programmes; she also produced a monthly show during the summer of 1972 which laid claim to being the first \\"Open Access\\" TV show for young people in the UK. This was called The Show Without A Title, and was the brainchild of the station's then Programme Controller Terry Fleet. The monthly show was presented by members of an editorial team that included David Rodgers, who later went on to become a familiar Westward TV staff presenter. Angela Rippon was the programme's Editor, with Roger Gage being its director. The show's run (which was broadcast at 5.20pm on Fridays after being pre-recorded in Studio One on the preceding Wednesday) was short-lived. A year later, in 1973, another series aimed at young people called Young Eyes took to the Westward TV airwaves; this was co-presented by Andy Price and the actress Lesley Manville. David Rodgers was again one of the regular contributors. Another popular long-running programme featured a puppet rabbit, Gus Honeybun, who appeared with the duty announcer who read out birthday greetings to the region's children: The story went that Gus was found wandering Dartmoor by a Westward Outside Broadcast unit. Children could request that Gus waggle his ears, wink, stand on his head, count their age in \\"bunny-hops\\", or turn off the lights. Gus's behaviour tended to be excellent for Roger Shaw, but for Judi Spiers and Iain Stirling he could be rather unpredictable. Gus was retained by TSW when they took over the franchise. On Sunday mornings, Westward aired Look and See, a five-minute religious slot for the under-8s broadcast from the continuity studio. Its presenters included Norah Thomas, Jill Mapson, Pat Webber and Ann Davey. As with most other ITV companies, the station also produced a nightly Epilogue under the title of Faith for Life, produced largely from the continuity studio. In 1980, Westward produced Maggie's Moor, a seven part networked children's drama series about a young girl living on Dartmoor during the Second World War. It starred Tamar le Bailly as MaggieBritish Film Institute, BFI database listing of Maggies Moor and was produced and directed by John King,British Film Institute, BFI Database entry for John King the father of wildlife photographer and presenter Simon King, who featured as \\"The Buzzard Boy\\" in Episode 5.British Film Institute, BFI Database entry for episode 7 of Maggies Moor  Agriculture  Agriculture was an important industry in South West England during Westward Television's franchise. Approximately 80% of land in South West England is in agricultural use (19.6% of England's total).South West Chamber of Rural Enterprise Westward TV had an Agricultural Advisory committee chaired by R. G. PomeroyCroston, Eric (editor) Television and Radio 1981 London: Independent Broadcasting Authority, p. 139 to advise the company on its agricultural output. For nine months of the year, Westward broadcast Farming NewsCroston, Eric (editor) Independent Television 1970, London: Independent Television Authority, p. 215 (later retitled Farm and Country NewsCroston, Eric (editor) Television and Radio 1975, London: Independent Broadcasting Authority, p. 205) on Sunday lunchtimes presented and edited by Peter Forde.British Film Institute, BFI listing of Farm and Country News Westward also produced an adult education series aimed at farmers called Acres For Profit.  Network contributions  Westward's contributions to the network were very rare at first, mainly consisting of one-off programmes and editions of the Morning Service (later renamed Morning Worship). Initially, Westward had an arrangement with ABC Weekend Television (ABC) to provide its network programming. As Channel Television took its network feed from Stockland Hill, this obliged Channel to affiliate to ABC. These 'affiliate' arrangements lasted until they were abolished in the 1964 franchise round. Westward also had an arrangement with Associated TeleVision (ATV), to play out any networked Westward programmes onto the ITV network. On 19 January 1972, there was a relaxation on the restrictions of broadcast hours that had been set by the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications. This allowed regular daytime programming on weekday afternoons, and weekday morning programming during out-of-school term time. These extra off-peak hours gave smaller ITV companies a chance to provide some networked or part-networked programmes. By the mid '70s, Westward had taken advantage of this opportunity by finding a small niche producing adult education programmes for the ITV network. These included the series Westcountry Fayre (cookery), Freeze! (freezing food) and Keep Britain Slim (slimming). = About Britain = One of the new daytime weekday programmes introduced through the relaxation of broadcast hours was About Britain. This strand was made up of half-hour documentaries contributed by each of the ITV regions covering interesting aspects of their respective regions. In 1973 the Countryside Commission opened the South West Coast Peninsula Walk from Minehead in Somerset to Swanage in Dorset via Land's End. Westward Television asked Diary reporter Clive Gunnell to walk the new route and film his journey.Croston, Eric (Editor): Television and Radio 1978, London: Independent Broadcasting Authority, p.29 Clive was a Londoner. He had begun his television career as a props man at Associated-Rediffusion, where he first met Kenneth MacLeod.Westward Shrine, Clive Gunnell obituary He had already walked the new Two Moors Walk from Plymouth to Lynmouth and filmed his journey for Westward Diary. This had proved popular and led to the new series Walking Westward. Clive Gunnell set off from Weston-super-Mare rather than Minehead, and his journey took many series to complete. It took five series before he reached the south coast. Westward used a selection of Clive's films as part of their contribution to About Britain,Croston, Eric (Editor): Television and Radio 1975, London: Independent Broadcasting Authority, p.205 and due to its network exposure Walking Westward remains one of Westward Television's best remembered programmes. Fifteen-minute sections of Clive Gunnell's walk along the Cornish coast were broadcast by the US Public Broadcasting Service as curtain raisers to the BBC's original version of Poldark in PBS's Masterpiece Theatre series. Clive Gunnell also made documentaries about inland areas that were also contributed to About Britain.

Generally, the papirosa is without a filter. Belomorkanal is an example of one of the stages in the evolution of cigarettes: it is composed of a hollow cardboard tube extended by a thin cigarette paper tube with tobacco. The cardboard tube plays the role of a disposable cigarette holder. This method was abandoned by Western brands shortly after World War II. While smoking, the hollow part of the tube is usually compressed to make two separate perpendicular flat surfaces, for the sake of convenience. Belomorkanal are still produced in various post-Soviet republics, most notably in Russia, in Kamianets-Podilskyi (Ukraine), and in Hrodna (Belarus). The brand became popular in most of the Soviet Bloc countries due to their low price. They are famed as one of the strongest cigarettes available in Eastern Europe (if not the strongest in the world). They have also been pictured in many works of art and literature.

The aircraft's disappointing performance and range prevented it from achieving commercial success. Although the SNCASE Armagnac did not have a sterling career, its passenger compartment design gave it a much roomier feel and greater capacity and foreshadowed the future wide- body jet airliners. Design and development Designed originally around a French requirement for an 87-passenger, long range airliner issued in 1942, the S.E. 2000 was to have been powered by four 2,100 hp Gnome-Rh√¥ne 18R engines. At an early stage, the S.E. 2000 was abandoned in favour of a larger, more capable version, the S.E. 2010 Armagnac. The Armagnac was a cantilever mid-wing monoplane with retractable tricycle landing gear designed for transatlantic service. A number of versions were planned from a 60-passenger \\"sleeping berth\\" version to 84-passenger, 108-passenger and 160-passenger versions.Stroud 1993, p. 61. After delays to the planning because of wartime conditions, work proceeded quickly at Toulouse, Marseilles and Paris, where various components were being built and tested. The Armagnac was designed from the outset in a Cook-Craigie production line prior to the first prototype which flew on 2 April 1949 with Sud-Est Chief Pilot Pierre Nadot at the controls but was lost on 30 January 1950 while still undergoing tests.Stroud 1993, p. 59. The first production series aircraft F-BAVD flew on 30 December 1950. Examples of the S.E.2010 were demonstrated at the 1951 and 1953 Paris Grand Palais. Although the S.E.2010 was powered by Pratt & Whitney R-4360-B13 Wasp Major engines, the most powerful piston engine ever placed into production for aircraft use, a concern that the final design was underpowered led to a planned redesign. The final (15th) production aircraft was intended to be re-engined with 5,400 hp Allison T40 turboprops, but production was curtailed at eight and the more advanced version was never built. An Armagnac, S.O. 2060, ended its days as an engine test-bed, alternately fitted with turbojet engines fitted in a nacelle below the fuselage. It was tested with two Snecma Atar 101 turbojets each engine having a different system of afterburner. The Snecma Vulcain was also tested in a similar manner.Green and Pollinger 1955, p. 175. Operational history F-BAVI used at the 1956 Olympic Games, Melbourne, Australia At the time, the Armagnac was one of the largest civil aircraft ever built with a wingspan of almost 50 meters and weight over 77 tonnes. The capacious pressurized cabin (with a near-circular fuselage section with 4.7 m/ 15 ft width and height) was intended for a three tier sleeping compartment configuration which ultimately was not fitted to any of the S.E.2010 versions. The fuselage was left with a good deal of unusable space with only open luggage shelves mounted in the upper fuselage.Stroud 1993, p. 60. Initial production of 15 aircraft was planned for delivery to launch customer Air France. After evaluation of the prototype by Air France, the airline declined delivery in 1952 when the first production aircraft was ready, citing inadequate performance. Despite being designed for transatlantic service, the aircraft's range of 5,000 km, fell short of the 6,500 km required range for this use. Additionally, the aircraft was too large to be operated profitably for shorter range routes. Including the sole prototype, only nine aircraft were built with TAI (Transports A√©riens Intercontinentaux) (later UTA) evaluating the first production aircraft in April 1952. A total of four S.E.2010s were delivered to TAI in December 1952, who used them for eight months and then discarded them as unprofitable. The aircraft passed to SAGETA (the Soci√©t√© Auxiliaire de G√©rance et d'Exploitation de Transport A√©riens) in 1953 who operated seven Armagnacs to ferry cargo, mail and troops from Toulouse to Saigon in French Indochina. They were highly regarded in this role, but French rule in the area was almost over and they were surplus by mid-1954. Most Armagnacs were broken up in 1955 although two were used to transport the French contingent to the 1956 Olympic Games held in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Jack Russell, a retired Australian Air Traffic Controller fondly recalled the Armagnac which was the most distinctive of the various aircraft types to visit Australia for the Games. His description: \\"...an 80-ton aircraft which resembled two shipping containers welded together lengthways with a wing and two under-powered engines protruding on each side. The aircraft's performance matched its appearance.\\" \\"Olympic Terminal, Essendon - 1956.\\" Airways Museum & Civil Aviation Historical Society, 2009. Retrieved: 1 May 2009.

Besides providing administrative offices for the Church Commissioners, the Archbishops' Council and the Church of England Pensions Board, and a chamber for the General Synod, the building also provided a meeting place for the Parliament of the United Kingdom during World War II, and for some of the organs of the newly formed United Nations afterwards. It has more recently been the venue for several notable public enquiries. Origins The idea of a central meeting and administrative building for the Church of England had been raised twice in the mid 19th century and was finally acted upon in 1886 when The Rt Rev. Dr Harvey Goodwin, Bishop of Carlisle, suggested in a letter to The Times that the Church should construct a \\"Church House\\" as a memorial of the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. Accordingly, a charity called the Corporation of the Church House was founded by Royal Charter on 23 February 1888, with the aim of raising the necessary funds and executing the project. A site was selected in Dean's Yard, close to Westminster Abbey and Westminster School. During 1888, sufficient funds had been raised to purchase the freehold on a block of buildings occupying the south side of Dean's Yard and bordered by Great Smith Street, Little Smith Street and Tufton Street. These buildings included the Westminster Free Library (which relocated to the other side of Great Smith Street) and a boarding house for pupils at Westminster School.The Church House 1888‚Äì1988 p. 4 The leases on 10 and 11 Dean's Yard could be purchased outright and these became the offices of several other Anglican societies, and were inaugurated as the first Church House on 21 July 1888.The Church House 1888‚Äì1988 p. 5 The Church House (1896) In November 1889, Sir Arthur Blomfield was selected to design the new building which was intended to occupy the whole site; the south fa√ßade of his plans bore some resemblance to Hampton Court Palace. Meanwhile, difficulties with fund raising and obtaining the leases of buildings on the site caused a considerable delay.The Church House 1888‚Äì1988 p. 6 The first part of the project was the Great Hall on the south of the site, the foundation stone for which was laid on 24 June 1891 by Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught,The Church House 1888‚Äì1988 p. 7 and was opened on 11 February 1896 by Prince George, Duke of York. Fund raising for the western block of the project was quickly under way; which was to include a library and a hall for meetings of the Convocation of Canterbury. This hall was to be named after Henry Hoare, who had been instrumental in the revival of the Convocation in 1852 (its first meeting since 1717). The hall was opened by The Most Rev. Dr Frederick Temple, Archbishop of Canterbury, on 28 January 1902. The rest of Blomfield's projected building was never completed.The Church House 1888‚Äì1988 p. 8 The Church House (present) The current building, designed by Sir Herbert Baker, is a 1930s replacement of the original building. Its construction was authorised by an Act of Parliament. Though delayed at first by the depression of the early 1930s, the foundation stone was laid by Queen Mary on 26 June 1937, and the building was officially opened by King George VI on 10 June 1940. After the building's Assembly Hall was directly hit during the Blitz and yet suffered little damage, the building was requisitioned for use as a chamber for the House of Lords. The first meeting of the United Nations General Assembly was held in Westminster Central Hall, on 10 January 1946. The Security Council met for the first time a week later, 17 January 1946, in Church House. Today, the building is the headquarters of the Archbishops' Council, the Church Commissioners and all its boards and councils (since 2007), as well as of the Church of England Pensions Board and the National Society. It is the meeting-place of the General Synod of the Church of England each February (alternating with York in July) and for special and inaugural sessions, usually in November. Areas of the building are available on a private hire basis for conferences and events.https://www.goaskeve.com/venues/church-house-westminster/ The Church House is also the meeting-place of the Annual Bond Solon Expert Witness Conference each November, which the largest gathering of Expert Witnesses in the UK. The building was made a Grade II listed building in 1988, and is currently used as a conference centre when the general synod is not in session.

Frequently located in lower- income neighborhoods, soup kitchens are often staffed by volunteer organizations, such as church or community groups. Soup kitchens sometimes obtain food from a food bank for free or at a low price, because they are considered a charity, which makes it easier for them to feed the many people who require their services. Many historical and typical modern soup kitchens serve only soup (hence its name), usually with some bread. But several establishments which refer to themselves as a \\"soup kitchen\\" also serve other types of food, so social scientists sometimes discuss them together with similar hunger relief agencies that provide more varied hot meals, like food kitchens and meal centers. While societies have been using various methods to share food with the hungry for millennia, the first soup kitchens in the modern sense may have emerged in the late 18th century. By the late 19th century, they were located in several American and European cities. In the United States and elsewhere, they became more prominent in the 20th century, especially during the Great Depression. With the much improved economic conditions that immediately followed World War II, soup kitchens became less widely used, at least in the advanced economies. In the United States, there was a resurgence in the use of soup kitchens following the cutbacks in welfare that were implemented in the early 1980s. In the 21st century, the use of soup kitchens expanded in both the United States and Europe, following lasting global increases in the price of food which began in late 2006. Demand for their services grew as the Great Recession began to worsen economic conditions for those with lower incomes. In much of Europe, demand further increased after the introduction of austerity-based economic policies from 2010. History The earliest occurrences of soup kitchens are difficult to identify. Throughout history, societies have invariably recognized a moral obligation to feed the hungry. The philosopher Simone Weil wrote that feeding the hungry when one has resources to do so is the most obvious obligation of all. She also said that as far back as Ancient Egypt, it was believed that people needed to show they had helped the hungry in order to justify themselves in the afterlife. Soup has long been one of the most economical and simple ways to supply nutritious food to large numbers of people. Social historian Karl Polanyi wrote that before markets became the world's dominant form of economic organisation in the 19th century, most human societies would generally either starve all together or not at all; because, communities would naturally share their food. As markets began to replace the older forms of resource allocation such as redistribution, reciprocity, and autarky, society's overall level of food security would typically rise. But food insecurity could become worse for the poorest section of society, and the need arose for more formal methods for providing them with food. Christian churches traditionally provided food for the hungry since Late Antiquity, with the nourishment mainly provided in the form of soup. =Emergence of the modern soup kitchen= Sir Benjamin Thompson, painted by Thomas Gainsborough, 1783The earliest modern soup kitchens were established by the inventor Sir Benjamin Thompson, who was employed as an aide-de-camp to the Elector of Bavaria in the 1790s. Thompson was an American loyalist refugee from New England and an inventor who was ennobled by Bavaria as Count Rumford. The Count was a prominent advocate of hunger relief, writing pamphlets that were widely read across Europe. His message was especially well received in Great Britain, where he had previously held a senior government position for several years and was known as \\"the Colonel\\". An urgent need had recently arisen in Britain for hunger relief, due to her leading role in driving the Industrial Revolution. While technological development and economic reforms were rapidly increasingly overall prosperity, conditions for the poorest were often made worse, as traditional ways of life were disrupted. In the closing years of the 18th century, soup kitchens run on the principles pioneered by Rumford were to be found throughout England, Wales, and Scotland, with about 60,000 people being fed by them daily in London alone. While soup kitchens were initially well regarded, they attracted criticism from some, for encouraging dependency, and sometimes on a local level for attracting vagrants to an area. In Britain, they were made illegal, along with other forms of aid apart from workhouses, by the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834. During the Irish famine of the 19th century, in which as many as one million people may have died, the British government passed the Temporary Relief Act (also known as the Soup Kitchen Act) in February 1847. The Act amended the restrictions on the provision of aid outside the workhouses for the duration of the famine and expressly allowed the establishment of soup kitchens in Ireland to relieve pressure from the overstretched Poor Law system, which was proving to be totally inadequate in coping with the disaster. Prohibition against soup kitchens was soon relaxed on mainland Britain too, though they never again became as prevalent as they had been in the early 19th century, partly as from the 1850s onwards, economic conditions generally began to improve even for the poorest. For the first few decades after the return of soup kitchens to mainland Britain, they were at first heavily regulated, run by groups like the Charity Organization Society. Even in the early 20th century, campaigning journalists like Bart Kennedy would criticize them for their long queues, and for the degrading questions staff would ask the hungry before giving out any soup. =Spread to the United States= Unemployed men outside a soup kitchen opened by upright=1.15 The concept of soup kitchens spread to the United States from Ireland after the Great famine and the concomitant wave of Irish emigration to the New World. The earliest ones were established in the 1870s. A sharp rise in the number of hungry people resulting from an industrial recession coincided with the success of the AICP, and the American branch of the Charity Organization Society, in getting various forms of \\"outdoor relief\\" banned. This resulted in civil society establishing soup kitchens, to help feed those of the poor who did not wish to subject themselves to the regimented organisation of the Almshouses favored by the charitable societies. Chilean women preparing soup kitchen meals in 1932 It is believed the term ‚Äúbreadline‚Äù entered the popular lexicon in the 1880s. It was during those years that a noteworthy bakery in New York City‚Äôs Greenwich Village, ‚ÄúFleischmann Model Viennese Bakery,‚Äù instituted a policy of distributing unsold baked goods to the poor at the end of their business day. By the late 19th century soup kitchens were to be found in several US cities. The concept of soup kitchens hit the mainstream of United States consciousness during the Great Depression. One soup kitchen in Chicago was even sponsored by American mobster Al Capone in an effort to clean up his image.\\"Soup Kitchens\\" Social Security Online History Page. With the improved economic conditions that followed the Second World War, there was less need for soup kitchens in advanced economies. However, with the scaling back of welfare provision in the 1980s under president Reagan's administration, there was a rapid rise in activity from grass roots hunger relief agencies such as soup kitchens. According to a comprehensive government survey completed in 2002, over 90% of food banks, about 80% of emergency kitchens, and all known food rescue organisations, were established in the US after 1981. Presently, Catholic Charities USA of Colorado Springs, Colorado, founded by The Sisters of Loretto, provides food to upwards of 600-700 persons or more per day, and has been doing so since 1985. In the 21st century Use of soup kitchens has grown rapidly across the world, following the lasting global inflation in the cost of food that began in late 2006. The financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 further increased the demand for soup kitchens, as did the introduction of austerity policies that have become common in Europe since 2010. Modern soup kitchens are generally well regarded, though like their historical counterparts they are sometimes disliked by local residents for lowering the tone of a neighborhood. = World's largest soup kitchen= The Harmandir Sahib at night The world's largest soup kitchen run at the Sikhs' holiest shrine, Golden Temple in Punjab, India, which according to Croatian Times can serve free food for up to 100,000 - 300,000 people every day. At the Langar (Kitchen), food is served to all visitors regardless of faith, religion, or background. Only vegetarian food is served and people eat together as equals. The institution of the Sikh langar, a community run free kitchen, was started by the first Sikh Guru, Guru Nanak. It was designed to uphold the principle of equality between all people regardless of religion, caste, colour, creed, age, gender, or social status. In addition to the ideals of equality, the tradition of langar expresses the ethics of sharing, community, inclusiveness, and oneness of humankind. Every Sikh shrine has a religiously sanctioned moral and humanitarian obligation to serve and provide hospitality, provisions, nourishments and meals to any man, regardless of race, creed, religious profession, identification, or affiliation. = Comparison with front line food banks and pantries= Members of the United States Navy serve the homeless at Dorothy's Soup Kitchen, Salinas, California in 2009 In some countries such as Great Britain, increased demand from hungry people has largely been met by food banks, operating on the \\"front line\\" model, where they give food out directly to the hungry. In the USA, such establishments are called \\"food pantries\\"; Americans generally reserve the term \\"food bank\\" for entities which perform a warehouse-like function, distributing food to front line agencies, but not directly to the hungry themselves. Instead of providing hot meals, front line food banks and pantries hand out packages of groceries so that recipients can cook themselves several meals at home. This is often more convenient for the end user. They can receive food for up to a dozen or so meals at once, whereas with a soup kitchen, they typically only receive a single meal with each visit. Food banks typically have procedures needed to prevent unscrupulous people taking advantage of them, unlike soup kitchens which will usually give a meal to whoever turns up with no questions asked. The soup kitchen's greater accessibility can make it more suitable for assisting people with long-term dependence on food aid. Soup kitchens can also provide warmth, companionship, and the shared communal experience of dining with others, which can be especially valued by people such as disabled, pensioners, widowers, homeless and ex-homeless. In some countries such as Greece, soup kitchens have become the most widely used form of food aid, with The Guardian reporting in 2012, that an estimated 400,000 Greeks visit a soup kitchen each day.

He subsequently passed the bar exam in Sacramento County, California (District 3) and was admitted to the State Bar of California on July 29, 2002; he is still an active member there, as of August, 2018.\\"The State Bar of California\\" Litigation =Pledge of Allegiance= Newdow is best known for the lawsuit which he states was filed on behalf of his daughter against inclusion of the words \\"under God\\" in public schools' recitals of the United States' Pledge of Allegiance. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found that the phrase constitutes an endorsement of religion, and therefore violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. However, the decision was later overruled by the Supreme Court of the United States on procedural grounds, citing that Newdow did not have custody of his daughter and therefore did not have the right to bring suit on her behalf, nor did he meet the Court's prudential standing requirements to bring the suit on behalf of himself. Newdow filed suit again in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California regarding the same issue, but this time on behalf of three unnamed parents and their children. Citing the precedent set by the Supreme Court in the course of Newdow's previous suit, Judge Lawrence K. Karlton ruled that Newdow did not have standing to bring his lawsuit,Newdow v. Congress of United States, 383 F. Supp. 2d 1229, 1239 (E.D. Cal. 2005) but the other plaintiffs did have standing. Based on the previous ruling by the Ninth Circuit, the judge ruled that the pledge is unconstitutional when recited in public schools. On March 11, 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the words \\"under God\\" in the Pledge of Allegiance in the case of Newdow v. Rio Linda Union School District. On page 60 of the ruling the court writes: \\"We hold that the California Education Code - 52720 and the School District's policy having teachers lead students in the recitation of the Pledge, and having those who do not wish to participate do so with impunity, do not violate the Establishment Clause. Therefore we reverse the decision of the district court holding that the School District's policy is unconstitutional and vacate the permanent injunction prohibiting the recitation of the Pledge by willing students.\\" The court also ruled against Newdow in that he had no prudential standing to file a complaint in the first place. Senior Circuit Judge Dorothy W. Nelson joined Judge Carlos T. Bea in the ruling, but Judge Stephen Reinhardt dissented. =In God We Trust= In November 2005, Newdow announced he wants to have \\"In God We Trust\\" removed from U.S. coins and banknotes. In a November 14, 2005 interview with Fox News's Neil Cavuto, Newdow compared \\"In God We Trust\\" appearing on United States currency with racial segregation (specifically separate drinking fountains), saying, \\"How can you not compare those? What is the difference there? Both of them [whites and blacks] got equal water. They both had access. It was government saying that it's okay to separate out these two people on the basis of race. Here we're saying it's okay to separate two people on the basis of their religious beliefs.\\" In a 2006 interview on the day that the United States House of Representatives passed the Pledge Protection Act, Newdow told WERS-FM's David Goodman, \\"A few hours ago, the House of Representatives of the Congress of the United States of America voted 260 to 167 to completely gut the U.S. Constitution of its separation of powers and violate numerous other clauses because they thought it was important enough to keep 'under God' in the Pledge of Allegiance. I don't think people would've done that for our political heritage or anything else. They did it because they want God in their government because it stands for a religious view that they adhere to, and they want to see that religious view espoused by government, which is exactly what the Establishment Clause forbids.\\" In June 2006, a federal judge rejected Newdow's Establishment Clause lawsuit on the grounds that the minted words amount to a secular national slogan, and do not dictate anyone's beliefs. Newdow stated that he would appeal the ruling, although Aronow v. United States was decided on the same grounds in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and the lower court was required to return the same ruling, likewise the Ninth Circuit does not traditionally overrule previous Ninth Circuit rulings. On December 4, 2007, Newdow argued before a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit to remove both \\"under God\\" from the Pledge of Allegiance (Roe v. Rio Linda Union School District), and \\"In God We Trust\\" from United States currency.Newdow v. Congress of the United States , Findlaw.com The Ninth Circuit rejected Newdow's challenge. In a decision published March 11, 2010, the court held that its earlier decision in Aronow, which \\"held the national motto is of a \\"patriotic or ceremonial character,\\" has no \\"theological or ritualistic impact,\\" and does not constitute \\"governmental sponsorship of a religious exercise,\\" foreclosed Newdow's argument. In an opinion concurring only in the judgment, even the extremely liberal Judge Stephen Reinhardt compare agreed that Aronow was controlling precedent. Newdow also filed a lawsuit in federal court after Franklin Graham gave the invocation at George W. Bush's 2001 inauguration. The lawsuit claimed that inaugural prayer was an unconstitutional endorsement of religion. It also was unsuccessful. =California textbook case= Newdow also represents California Parents for the Equalization of Educational Materials (CAPEEM), a group that has filed a lawsuit against the officials of California Department of Education and the California State Board of Education. The lawsuit challenges the teaching of biblical events as historical facts and was brought by CAPEEM, which was formed by Hindu parents in California. CAPEEM eventually settled the lawsuit for $175,000. =Obama inauguration= On December 31, 2008, Newdow and 17 other people, plus 10 groups representing atheists, sued Chief Justice John G. Roberts and others involved in the inauguration of Barack Obama in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, seeking to prevent the Chief Justice from saying \\"so help me God.\\" The Constitution specifically defines only this single oath of office of 35 words and does not include these four words. The Associated Press ran several reports including one picked up by The Washington Post and many other affiliates that inaccurately stated that the suit was an attempt by atheists to prevent the President from saying \\"so help me God.\\" The suits specifically states that an injunction is not sought against the president, but rather only against the Chief Justice. In addition, in other counts was the demand to end all religious prayer at the inauguration based on the establishment clause of the First Amendment, which he had sued to prevent in the two previous inaugurations unsuccessfully. Judge Reggie Walton refused to grant Newdow's motion for a preliminary injunction, reasoning that as a district court judge he did not feel he had the authority to issue such an order against the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, and that the inclusion of such words is an exercise of the incoming President's right of free speech, although the president's right to express his private prayer in words of his choosing was specifically not challenged in the lawsuit, Justice Roberts was served with a demand notice. The outcome was that Mr. Obama did conclude with \\"So Help Me God\\" but the prompting was in the form of a query, indicating that this was his choice and not part of the constitutionally prescribed oath of office Oath of office of the President of the United States#\\"So help me God\\" Newdow later reported that he would not challenge the denial of his preliminary injunction motion, but would appeal the case through the appellate court. In Newdow v. Roberts, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the case, holding that Newdow's claims with respect to the 2009 inauguration were moot, and that he lacked standing to challenge the 2013 and 2017 inaugurations. In May 2011, the United States Supreme Court denied Newdow's request to hear the case. Justice Roberts response to Newdow's petition was to prompt Obama's \\"So Help Me God\\" with a question, \\"So Help You God\\" to differentiate from the other 36 constitutional words.Newdow v.

They were originally bred for rescue work by the hospice of the Great St Bernard Pass on the Italian-Swiss border. The hospice, built by and named after Italian monk Bernard of Menthon, acquired its first dogs between 1660 and 1670. The breed has become famous through tales of Alpine rescues, as well as for its large size. Description The St. Bernard is recognized internationally today as one of the Molossoid breeds. It is a giant dog. The coat can be either smooth or rough; the smooth coat being close and flat, while the rough is dense, flat, and more profuse around the neck and legs. The colour is typically a red shade with white, or a mahogany brindle with white. Black shading is usually found on the face and ears. The tail is long and heavy, hanging high.

The first evidence that the dogs were in use at the monastery is in two paintings dating to 1690 by Italian artist Salvator Rosa. The most famous St. Bernard to save people at the pass was Barry (sometimes spelled Berry), who reportedly saved somewhere between 40 and 100 lives. There is a monument to Barry in the Cimeti√®re des Chiens, and his body was preserved in the Natural History Museum in Bern. Another famous dog was Rutor, the faithful companion of the Italian priest Pierre Chanoux, who was named after the peak T√™te du Rutor located above the Little St Bernard pass. The classic St. Bernard looked very different from the St. Bernard of today because of crossbreeding. Severe winters from 1816 to 1818 led to increased numbers of avalanches, killing many of the dogs used for breeding while they were performing rescues. In an attempt to preserve the breed, the remaining St. Bernards were crossed with Newfoundlands brought from the Colony of Newfoundland in the 1850s, and so lost much of their use as rescue dogs in the snowy climate of the Alps because the long fur they inherited would freeze and weigh them down. The dogs never received any special training from the monks. Instead, younger dogs would learn how to perform search and rescue operations from older dogs. The Swiss St. Bernard Club was founded in Basel on 15 March 1884. The St. Bernard was the very first breed entered into the Swiss Stud Book in 1884, and the breed standard was finally approved in 1888. Since then, the breed has been a Swiss national dog. The dogs at the St. Bernard hospice were working dogs that were smaller than today's show St. Bernards. Originally about the size of a German Shepherd Dog, the St. Bernard grew to the size of today's dog as kennel clubs and dog shows emphasized appearance over the dog's working ability, along with a closed stud book. An open stud book would have allowed breeders to correct such errors by breeding in working dogs of other dog breeds.

The pass, the lodge, and the dogs are named for Bernard of Menthon, the 11th century Italian monk who established the station. \\"St. Bernard\\" was not in widespread use until the middle of the 19th century. The dogs were called \\"Saint Dogs\\", \\"Noble Steeds\\", or \\"Barry Dogs\\" before that time. = Related breeds = The breed is strikingly similar to the English Mastiff, but not the same, with which Maybe it shares a common ancestor. Modern St. Bernard is radically different than the original dogs kept at the St. Bernard hospice, most notably by being much larger in size and build. Since the late 1800s, the St. Bernard breed has been ever refined and improved, using many different large molosser-type breeds, including the Newfoundland, Great Pyrenees, Greater Swiss Mountain Dog, Bernese Mountain Dog, Great Dane, English Mastiff, and possibly the Tibetan Mastiff and Caucasian Shepherd Dog. Other breeds such as the Rottweiler, Boxer, and Bulldog may have contributed to the St. Bernard's bloodline as well. It is suspected that many of these large breeds were used to redevelop each other to combat the threat of their extinction after World War II, which may explain why all of them played a part in the creation of the St. Bernard as it is seen today. The four Sennenhund breeds, the Grosser Schweizer Sennenhund (Greater Swiss Mountain Dog), the Berner Sennenhund (Bernese Mountain Dog), the Appenzeller Sennenhund (Appenzeller Mountain Dog), and the Entlebucher Sennenhund (Entlebucher Mountain Dog) are similar in appearance to the St. Bernard and share the same location and history, but are tricolor rather than red and white. The Russian army kennels crossbred St. Bernards with Caucasian Shepherd Dogs to produce the Moscow Watchdogs that are still used as military service dogs in Russia today. St Bernards have in common many characteristics of livestock guardian dog breeds.

The breed is recognised by The Kennel Club (UK), the Canadian Kennel Club, and the American Kennel Club in the Working Dog group. The United Kennel Club in the United States places the breed in the Guardian Dog Group. The New Zealand Kennel Club and the Australian National Kennel Council place the breed in the Utility Group Modern activities ‚Äì Great St Bernard Pass and Little St Bernard Pass A St. Bernard performing agility at the Rose City Classic AKC Show 2007, Portland, Oregon, USA. St. Bernards are no longer used for Alpine rescues, the last recorded instance of which was in 1955. As late as 2004, the Great St Bernard Hospice still retained 18 of the dogs for reasons of tradition and sentiment. In that year, the Barry Foundation created breeding kennels for the breed at the town of Martigny down the Great Saint Bernard Pass, and purchased the remaining dogs from the Hospice. During the summer months each year, a number of the animals are temporarily relocated from Martigny to the Hospice for viewing by tourists. An annual celebration of the breed takes place on the Little Saint Bernard Pass and at the town of Rosi√®res-Montvalzan on the French side. St. Bernard enthusiasts and breeders gather for a dog show and parades. The animals bred by the Foundation are trained to participate in a variety of dog sports, including carting and weight pulling. The dogs at the Barry Foundation are reportedly smaller than the average St. Bernard. Health The very fast growth rate and the weight of a St. Bernard can lead to very serious deterioration of the bones if the dog does not get proper food and exercise. Many dogs are genetically affected by hip dysplasia or elbow dysplasia. Osteosarcoma (bone cancer) has been shown to be hereditary in the breed. They are susceptible to eye disorders called entropion and ectropion, in which the eyelid turns in or out. The breed standard indicates that this is a major fault. The breed is also susceptible to epilepsy and seizures, a heart disease called dilated cardiomyopathy, and eczema. U.S. and U.K. breed clubs put the average lifespan for a St. Bernard at 8‚Äì10 years. A 2003 Danish breed survey (35 dogs) puts the median lifespan at 9.5 years, while a U.K. breed survey in 2004 (53 dogs) puts the median lifespan at 7 years. In the U.K. survey, about one in five lived to >10 years, with the longest-lived dog at 12 years and 9 months. A study of genetically related polyneuropathy in the breed was conducted.  Temperament  Known as a classic example of a gentle giant, the Saint Bernard is calm, patient and sweet with adults, and especially children. However St. Bernards, like all very large dogs, must be well socialized with people and other dogs in order to prevent fearfulness and any possible aggression or territoriality. The biggest threat to small children is being accidentally knocked over by this breed's larger size. Overall they are a gentle, loyal and affectionate breed, and if socialized are very friendly. Because of its large adult size, it is essential that proper training and socialization begin while the St. Bernard is still a puppy, so as to avoid the difficulties that normally accompany training large dogs. An unruly St. Bernard may present problems for even a strong adult, so control needs to be asserted from the beginning of the dog's training. While generally not instinctively protective, a St. Bernard may bark at strangers, and their size makes them good deterrents against possible intruders. The St. Bernard was bred to be a working companion and to this day the St. Bernard lives to please its master and is an amiable yet hard worker. St. Bernards have retained their natural ability for scent work and depending on the skill of the trainer and the talents of the dog, St. Bernards can participate in tracking events or even become involved in search and rescue work. Notability = In media = St. Bernards are often portrayed, especially in old live action comedies such as Swiss Miss, the TV series Topper, and classic cartoons, wearing small barrels of brandy around their necks. Avalanche victims supposedly drank the brandy to stay warm while awaiting rescue, although this is medically unsound. The monks of the St. Bernard Hospice deny that any St. Bernard has ever carried casks or small barrels around their necks; they attribute the image to an 1820 painting by Edwin Landseer, perhaps Alpine Mastiffs Reanimating a Distressed Traveler (which became a popular engraving in 1831 by Charles Landseer). The monks did keep casks around for photographs by tourists. There was apparently at least one dog that really did carry brandy. In The Percy Anecdotes, by Thomas Byerley, published in 1823, the following anecdote appears, and was often quoted in other books in the 19th century: > The breed of dogs kept by the monks to assist them ... has been long > celebrated for its sagacity and fidelity. All the oldest and most tried of > them were lately buried, along with some unfortunate travellers, under a > valanche [sic]; but three or four hopeful puppies were left at home in the > convent, and still survive. The most celebrated of those who are no more, > was a dog called Barry. This animal served the hospital for the space of > twelve years, during which time he saved the lives of forty individuals. His > zeal was indefatigable. Whenever the mountain was enveloped in fogs and > snow, he set out in search of lost travellers. He was accustomed to run > barking until he lost breath, and would frequently venture on the most > perilous places. When he found his strength was insufficient to draw from > the snow a traveller benumbed with cold, he would run back to the hospital > in search of the monks‚Ä¶. > > When old age deprived him of strength, the Prior of the Convent pensioned > him at Berney, by way of reward. After his death, his hide was stuffed and > deposited in the museum of that town. The little phial, in which he carried > a reviving liquor for the distressed travellers whom he found among the > mountains, is still suspended from his neck. A Punch magazine cartoon from 1949 depicts a man with a St. Bernard and several puppies, all of which are wearing neck casks. The man explains, \\"Of course, I only breed them for the brandy.\\" A frequent joke in old MGM and Warner Brothers shorts is to depict the dogs as compulsive alcoholics who engage in frequent nips from their own casks. = Famous St. Bernards = A drawing of Barry rescuing a small child * Bachelor, Resident Dog, the Ritz- Carlton, Bachelor Gulch * Burtonswood (Bossy Boots).

It was caused by a shift in the Rio Grande, as a survey presented in 1852 marked differences between the bed of the Rio Grande (in ) and the present channel of the river.Los Angeles Times (Dec 22, 1963) \\"End to the El Chamizal Affair\\" Tensions over the territory during the historic Taft‚ÄìDiaz summit almost resulted in the attempted assassination of both presidents on October 16, 1909. The Spanish word chamizal comes from chamizo, the common name for the four-wing saltbush (Atriplex canescens) which covered the disputed land near the present-day park. Origins (1848‚Äì1899) The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (which officially ended the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War) defined the international border as the line along the middle of the deepest channel in the Rio Grande, continuously in tandem with any fluctuation in its channels or its banks. In 1884, another treaty modified this by explicitly accepting the internationally established doctrine that the line of a river-defined border shall follow the changing path of the boundary river only in response to alluvial deposition, but that avulsion shall not affect the borderline. The river continually shifted south between 1852 and 1868, with the most radical shift in the river occurring after a flood in 1864. By 1873 the river had moved approximately , cutting off land that was in effect made United States territory. The newly exposed land came to be known as El Chamizal, and eventually the land was settled and incorporated as part of El Paso. Both Mexico and the United States claimed the land. In 1895, Mexican citizens filed suit in the Ju√°rez Primary Court of Claims to reclaim the land. In 1899, both countries dug a channel across the heel of the horseshoe bend of the river at the dispute site for flood control purpose. This moved a 385-acre tract of land to the U.S. side of the river, but as man-made alterations do not change the boundary, this tract of land remained Mexican territory. This tract of land came to be known as Cordova Island, in a sense it was an island belonging to Mexico inside U.S. territory. Thus, there was little or no control by the local authorities, which created a haven for crime and opportunities for illegal crossings. Disputes and controversy (1899‚Äì1963) U.S. Ambassador to Mexico, Thomas C. Mann (left) and the Mexican Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Manuel Tello Baurraud (right) sign the Chamizal Convention in Mexico City on 29 August 1963. In 1909, Porfirio D√≠az and William Howard Taft planned a summit in Ciudad Ju√°rez and El Paso, a historic first meeting between a Mexican and a U.S. president and also the first time an American president would cross the border into Mexico. But tensions rose on both sides of the border over the Chamizal, which any route from El Paso to Ciudad Ju√°rez would cross, even though it would be considered neutral territory with no flags present during the summit. The Texas Rangers, 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, U.S. Secret Service agents, federal agents and U.S. marshals were all called in to provide security. Frederick Russell Burnham, the celebrated scout, was put in charge of a 250-person private security detail hired by John Hays Hammond, who in addition to owning large investments in Mexico was a close friend of Taft from Yale and a U.S. Vice-Presidential candidate in 1908. On October 16, the day of the summit, Burnham and Private C.R. Moore, a Texas Ranger, discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route. Burnham and Moore captured, disarmed, and arrested the assassin within only a few feet of D√≠az and Taft. Mexicans celebrate in June, 1962 as JFK visits Mexico City shortly before the end of the dispute. In 1910 Mexico and the United States agreed to have the dispute settled by the International Boundary and Water Commission, a body that had been created in 1889 to maintain the boundary (and which was subsequently expanded pursuant to subsequent treaties, in order to allocate river waters between the two nations, and provide for flood control and water sanitation).Robert J. McCarthy, Executive Authority, Adaptive Treaty Interpretation, and the International Boundary and Water Commission, U.S.-Mexico, 14-2 U. Denv. Water L. Rev. 197 (Spring 2011) A tribunal was established comprising a representative from each country and a Canadian jurist, Eugene Lafleur, as presiding officer to investigate and deliberate over whether the change in the river's course had been gradual, whether the boundaries set by treaties were fixed, and whether the 1848 treaty applied.Los Angeles Times (Mar 13, 1963) Ruben Salazar, \\"Texas Due to Return 450 Acres to Mexico\\" Mexico claimed that the boundary had never changed and therefore that the Chamizal was technically Mexican territory, while the United States claimed that the 1848 convention applied, that the boundary was the result of sudden erosion, and that the property therefore belonged to the United States. The tribunal recommended that year that part of the disputed tract lying between the riverbed, as surveyed in 1852, and the middle of the river in 1864 would become United States territory and the remainder of the tract become part of Mexico. The United States rejected the proposal on grounds that it did not conform to the agreements of the arbitration - instead it fuelled an ongoing dispute between the two governments and fostered ill-will. Between 1911 and 1963 various presidents made several more attempts to resolve the issue. Amongst the suggested compromises were forgiving debt, exchange of other territory along the Rio Grande, direct purchase of the tract, and inclusion of the Chamizal in the Rio Grande Rectification Project. The dispute continued to affect Mexico‚ÄìUnited States relations adversely until President John F. Kennedy agreed to settle it on the basis of the 1911 arbitration award.Los Angeles Times (December 21, 1963) Don Irwin, \\"Johnson Signs Treaty on Chamizal Turnover\\" It was hoped that settlement of the dispute would strengthen the Alliance for Progress and solidify the Organization of American States. Resolution U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson (left) and Mexican President Adolfo L√≥pez Mateos (right) unveil the new boundary marker signaling the peaceful end of the Chamizal dispute on 25 September 1964. The dispute was formally settled on 14 January 1964, when the United States and Mexico ratified a treaty that generally followed the 1911 arbitration recommendations. The agreement awarded to Mexico of the Chamizal area and east of the adjacent Cordova Island. Although no payments were made between the two governments, the United States received compensation from a private Mexican bank for 382 structures included in the transfer. The United States also received of Cordova Island from Mexico, and the two nations agreed to share equally in the cost of rechanneling the river. In 1964, Presidents Adolfo L√≥pez Mateos and Lyndon B. Johnson met at the border to end the dispute. On 17 September 1963, the U.S. Congress introduced the American‚ÄìMexican Chamizal Convention Act of 1964, which finally settled the matter. In October 1967, President Johnson met with President Gustavo D√≠az Ordaz on the border and formally proclaimed the settlement. One of the aims of the Chamizal Convention was to build a man-made channel to prevent the Rio Grande from blurring the international boundary ever again. The channel was constructed of concrete, in width at the top and deep.Los Angeles Times (Jul 21, 1963) \\"Curtain on El Chamizal\\" The two governments shared the cost of the channel, along with the cost of three new bridges. The United States established a museum known as the Chamizal National Memorial in 1974 to increase visitor awareness of cooperation, diplomacy and cultural values as a basic means to conflict resolution.Los Angeles Times (Jul 20, 1963) \\"Juarez Victors Cheer El Paso Deal Feebly\\" See also * Chamizal National Memorial * Historic regions of the United States * Rio Grande border disputes References Sources   External links * Reports of International Arbitral Awards ‚Äì The Chamizal Case * Handbook of Texas Online: Chamizal Dispute Category:History of the foreign relations of the United States Category:1963 in Mexico Category:International territorial disputes of the United States Category:Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border Category:Territorial disputes of Mexico Category:Arbitration cases ","title":"Chamizal dispute"},{"id":"550038","text":"David Cromwell (born 1962) is a British media campaigner and oceanographer.

Himmler's assumption of total control over all security and police forces in Germany was the \\"crucial precondition\\" for the establishment and growth of the Nazi state. He combined the Nazi Party's Sicherheitsdienst (SD; SS intelligence service) with the Sicherheitspolizei (SiPo; \\"Security Police\\"), which was nominally under the Interior Ministry. The SiPo was composed of two sub-departments, the Geheime Staatspolizei (Gestapo; \\"Secret State Police\\") and the Kriminalpolizei (Kripo; \\"Criminal Police\\"). The RSHA was often abbreviated to RSi-H in correspondence to avoid confusion with the SS-Rasse- und Siedlungshauptamt (RuSHA; \\"SS Race and Settlement Office\\"). The creation of the RSHA represented the formalization, at the top level, of the relationship under which the SD served as the intelligence agency for the security police. A similar coordination existed in the local offices. Within Germany and areas which were incorporated within the Reich for the purpose of civil administration, local offices of the Gestapo, criminal police, and SD were formally separate. They were subject to coordination by inspectors of the security police and SD on the staffs of the local higher SS and police leaders, however, and one of the principal functions of the local SD units was to serve as the intelligence agency for the local Gestapo units. In the occupied territories, the formal relationship between local units of the Gestapo, criminal police, and SD was slightly closer. Throughout the course of wartime expansion, the RSHA continued to grow at an enormous rate and was \\"repeatedly reorganized\\". Routine reorganization did not change the tendency for centralization within the Third Reich nor did it change the general trend for organizations like the RSHA to develop direct relationships to Hitler, adhering to a familiar National Socialist pattern of the leader-follower construct. For the RSHA, its centrality within Nazi Germany was pronounced since departments like the Gestapo (within the RSHA) were controlled by Himmler and his immediate subordinate SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer and General of Police Reinhard Heydrich; they held the power of life and death for nearly every German and were essentially above the law. Reinhard Heydrich, the original chief of the RSHA, as an SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer in August 1940 Heydrich remained the RSHA chief until his assassination in 1942. In January 1943 Himmler delegated the office to SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer and General of Police Ernst Kaltenbrunner, who headed the RSHA until the end of World War II in Europe. The head of the RSHA was also known as the CSSD or Chef der Sicherheitspolizei und des SD (Chief of the Security Police and of the Security Service). Organization According to British author Gerald Reitlinger, the RSHA \\"became a typical overblown bureaucracy... The complexity of RSHA was unequalled... with at least a hundred... sub-sub-sections, a modest camouflage of the fact that it handled the progressive extermination which Hitler planned for the ten million Jews of Europe\\". =Structure= The organization at its simplest was divided into seven offices (√Ñmter): * Amt I, \\"Administration and Legal\\", originally headed by SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer Dr. Werner Best. In 1940, he was succeeded by SS-Brigadef√ºhrer Bruno Streckenbach. In April 1944, Erich Ehrlinger took over as department chief. * Amt II, \\"Ideological Investigation\\", headed by SS-Brigadef√ºhrer Professor Franz Six. * Amt III, \\"Spheres of German Life\\" or the Inland-SD, headed by SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer Otto Ohlendorf, was the SS information gathering service for inside Germany. It also dealt with ethnic Germans outside of Germany's prewar borders, and matters of culture. * Amt IV, \\"Suppression of Opposition\\", formed from Abteilung II and III of the Gestapa. Better-known by the \\"sobriquet\\" Gestapo. It was headed by SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer Heinrich M√ºller. SS-Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Adolf Eichmann, one of the main architects of the Holocaust, was head of the Amt IV sub-department called Referat IV B4. * Amt V, \\"Suppression of Crime\\" Kriminalpolizei (Kripo), originally led by SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer Arthur Nebe and later by SS-Oberf√ºhrer Friedrich Panzinger. This was the Criminal Police, which dealt with non-political serious crimes, such as rape, murder, and arson. Amt V was also known as the Reichskriminalpolizeiamt (Reich Criminal Police Department or RKPA). * Amt VI, \\"Foreign Intelligence Service\\" or Ausland-SD, originally led by SS-Brigadef√ºhrer Heinz Jost and later by SS- Brigadef√ºhrer Walter Schellenberg. * Amt VII, \\"Ideological Research and Evaluation\\" was a reconstitution of Amt II overseen by SS-Brigadef√ºhrer Professor Dr. Franz Six. Later it was headed by SS-Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Paul Dittel. It was responsible for \\"ideological\\" tasks. These included the creation of anti-semitic, anti-masonic propaganda, the sounding of public opinion and monitoring of Nazi indoctrination by the public. =Leadership= Flag for the Chief of the SiPo and SD Role in the Holocaust The RSHA controlled the security services of Nazi Germany and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Its activities included intelligence-gathering, criminal investigation, overseeing foreigners, monitoring public opinion, and Nazi indoctrination. The RSHA was also \\"the central office for the extra-judicial NS (National Socialist) measures of terror and repression from the beginning of the war until 1945\\". The list of \\"enemies\\" included Jews, Communists, Freemasons, pacifists, and Christian activists. In addition to dealing with identified enemies, the RSHA advocated expansionist policies for the Reich and the Germanization of additional territory through settlement. Generalplan Ost (General Plan East), which was the secret Nazi plan to colonize Central and Eastern Europe exclusively with Germans, displacing inhabitants in the process through genocide and ethnic cleansing in order to obtain sufficient Lebensraum, stemmed from officials in the RSHA, among other Nazi organizations . According to German historian, Klaus Hildebrand, the RSHA was \\"particularly concerned with racial matters\\". Adolf Eichmann stated in 1937 that \\"the anger of the people expressed in riots [was] the most effective means to rob the Jews of a sense of security\\"; although the chaos of rioting was debated within the RHSA, it continued in many places and forms, not monitored, and even encouraged by the RHSA. An order issued by the RSHA on 20 May 1941 overtly demonstrates its utter complicity for the systematic extermination of Jews, namely since the order included instructions to block emigration of any and all Jews attempting to leave Belgium or France as part of the \\"imminent Final Solution of the Jewish question\\". Besides blocking emigration, the RSHA, working with Eichmann's Reich Association of Jews in Germany, deliberately deceived Jews still living in Germany and those of other countries by promising them good living quarters, medical care, and food in Theresienstadt (a concentration camp which was a way station to extermination facilities like Auschwitz) if they turned over their assets to the RSHA through a 'phony' home-purchase plan. The RSHA oversaw the Einsatzgruppen, death squads that were formed under the direction of Heydrich and operated by the SS. Originally part of the SiPo, in September 1939 the operational control of the Einsatzgruppen was taken over by the RSHA. When the units were re-formed prior to the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, the men of the Einsatzgruppen were recruited from the SD, Gestapo, Kripo, Orpo, and Waffen-SS. The units followed the invasion forces of the German Army into Eastern Europe. In its role as the national and NSDAP security service, the RSHA coordinated activities among a number of different agencies that had wide-ranging responsibilities within the Reich. Not infrequently, commanders of Einsatzgruppen and Einsatzkommando sub-units were also desk officers from the main office of the RSHA. Historian Raul Hilberg estimates that between 1941 and 1945 the Einsatzgruppen, related agencies, and foreign auxiliary troops co-opted by the Nazis, killed more than two million people, including 1.3 million Jews. Part of the RSHA's efforts to encourage other nations (many of whom were occupied by the Germans) to hand over their Jews or entice them into the arms of the Nazis, included coercing them by assigning Jewish advisory officials, all of which was part and parcel to Eichmann's goal of rounding up and transporting \\"Jews from Slovakia and Hungary, Croatia and Romania\\". Entry into the Second World War afforded the RSHA the power to act as an intermediary in the areas extended far beyond the Reich, which according to Hans Mommsen, lent itself to solving \\"emergency situations\\" and the RSHA's radicalized destructive goals like the Final Solution, were implemented thereupon with bureaucratic methodical cruelty as its power expanded. Rosenstrasse protest and RSHA involvement As early as 1941, Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels began to complain that large numbers of Jews had not been \\"evacuated\\" because of their work in the armaments industry. By late 1942, Hitler and the RSHA were ready to rid Berlin of the German Jews still residing there. Many were married to Aryan Germans and protected by their jobs in armament factories, as the firms deemed these Jewish employees irreplaceable laborers. These Jews believed that these factors ensured their safety. Auschwitz was pushing the government to send more laborers as they struck a deal with the arms producer IG Farben to construct a camp specifically for arms development using slave labor, further supporting Hitler's decision. In September 1942, Hitler decided that the protection of armament companies must end and that the Jews must go. As a result, the RSHA decreed the Fabrik-Aktion, an initiative which expressed their intent to \\"register\\" all Jews working in these firms; it also stated that the primary targets of this action were those Jews \\"living in mixed marriages.\\" The RSHA planned to remove all German Jews from Berlin in early 1943 (the deadline to deport these Jews was 28 February 1943, according to a diary entry Goebbels wrote in early February). On 27 February 1943, the RSHA sent plainclothes Gestapo officials to work, arresting intermarried Jews and charging them with various crimes; anywhere the Gestapo could find Berlin's Jews, they were detained. Around 2,000 intermarried Jewish men were taken to Rosenstrasse 2-4, where they were held. Goebbels complained that many of the arrests had been \\"thwarted\\" by industrialists since some 4,000 Jews were expected to be detained. Angry wives began appearing in front of the building on Rosenstrasse to protest‚Äîas \\"Women of German blood\\" on behalf of their husbands‚Äîagainst this action. On 6 March, all but 25 of the intermarried Jews were released; the 25 still held were sent to Auschwitz. The RSHA had failed at quietly rounding up and deporting Jewish men married to German women. On 8 March, RSHA head Ernst Kaltenbrunner told Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick that the deportations had been limited to Jews who were not intermarried.

After the founding of the RSHA in 1939, Eichmann became director of RSHA sub-section (Referat) IV D 4 (Clearing Activities, or R√§umungsangelegenheiten) (1940), and, after March 1941, IV B 4 (Jewish Affairs, or Judenreferat). Both offices organized the deportation of Jews. From this position, Eichmann played a central role in transporting over 1.5 million Jews from all over Europe to Nazi killing centers.

Recipients were selected by popular vote for having made outstanding contributions to Australian society in any field of human endeavour.  History  In 1997 the National Trust of Australia (NSW) called for nominations from the public for 100 Australian Living Treasures, and each nomination was counted as one vote. The nominees had to be living and had to have made a substantial and enduring contribution. The choice of those who were named as National Living Treasures was made by more than 10,000 Australians voting. Their votes determined who was chosen. The first list of 100 Living Treasures was published in 1997. Phillip Adams, himself named as a National Treasure, gave his own opinion in an article on ANZAC Day in 2015 that when the list was first published in 1997, most were amused to find they were nominated; he suggested an alternative list to \\"celebrate those who make us happy\\".\\"National Living Treasures? I've got another list\\" by Phillip Adams, The Australian, 25 April 2015 (ANZAC Day) In 2004 the list was refreshed with 15 new names, following the deaths of some people on the list and the exclusion of former Justice Marcus Einfeld who was imprisoned subsequent to his retirement for perjury and perverting the course of justice relative to a speeding ticket,. following an identical process to that used in 1997 ‚Äì a public nomination and vote. On 23 January 2012, the National Trust of Australia (NSW) joined with Woman's Day magazine to launch a nationwide search for seven new National Living Treasures. They were announced, amid controversy, on 4 March 2012, when the National Trust refused to endorse the NSW branch's listing of the mining magnate Clive Palmer as one of the members. \\"National living treasure uproar\\" by Christine Sams and Cosima Marriner, The Sydney Morning Herald, 4 March 2012 Graeme Blackman, the chairman of the Australian Council of National Trusts, said that \\"I am telling you, as the chairman, it is not auspiced by the National Trust nationally.\\" However, the next day it was reported that \\"trust president Ian Carroll said the titles recognised that the country's culture was more than just our buildings and natural heritage.\\" It was later revealed that the vote for Palmer had been manipulated, with a number of internal emails having been sent to his company's staff, their family and friends, urging that they vote for \\"Professor Clive Palmer\\". On 30 July 2014, the board of the National Trust of Australia (NSW) voted to remove Rolf Harris from the list after his conviction on 12 charges of indecent assault between 1969 and 1986 and to also withdraw the award.National Living Treasures ‚Äì Current List, Deceased, Formerly Listed, National Trust of Australia (NSW), 22 August 2014 Harris had been among the original 100 Australians selected for the honour in 1997.

It is native to the Paraguay basin of southern Brazil. They are often found in the aquarium trade. Description An adult black neon tetra A juvenile black neon tetra This species is of typical elongated tetra appearance; it is of plain basic coloration but with two distinct, adjacent longitudinal stripes, white above black. The eye has two thin but distinctive color bands across the top, red above yellow. It grows to a maximum overall length of approximately . Despite its common name, it does resemble the neon tetra, which belongs to the same genus (Hyphessobrycon). The fish's natural diet consists of small invertebrates and plants. H. herbertaxelrodi is commonly kept as an aquarium fish by hobbyists. The black neon tetra is sometimes called the black tetra, but that name more properly refers to a different species, Gymnocorymbus ternetzi. In the aquarium Black neon tetras should be kept in soft acidic water, which should be kept clean at all times. Their tank should contain live plants, a darker substrate and open water for swimming. Black neon Tetras should be kept in groups of at least 6, preferably more. The Black neon tetra requires the following aquarium conditions: *Recommended min. aquarium volume for a group of 6 is about 15 US gallons (60 L), and for a group of 8-10 fishes about 20 gallons. *pH 5 - 7 *dH (hardness) 1 - 2 *Temperature These fish swim at the top level of the aquarium, and do not feed from the bottom of the tank. Therefore, it is recommended they be kept with bottom dwelling fish (such as pygmy corydoras) so that leftover food is then eaten up off the substrate and not left to waste. Black neon tetras can be fed a variety of foods, including flake, frozen and freeze dried food. Small live foods like worms and brine shrimp are also recommended as they bring out the fish's colours. =Breeding= Black neon tetras can be spawned rather easily if the water quality is right. Before attempting to breed the black neon tetra, condition the prospective parents with good food. Fish of about one year old are suitable for breeding. The sex of the fish can be determined by its body shape, the female being much deeper and more plump than the males. Although the black neon tetra can be kept in water harder and more alkaline than its natural habitat, for breeding it is necessary to get closer to what it would get in the Amazon. Breeding the Black neon tetra requires acidic water with no more than four degrees of hardness. Use dim lighting. The black neon tetra is an egg scatterer, laying adhesive (sticky) eggs over plants, etc. One female can produce several hundred eggs. The parents will eat their own eggs and babies, so it is normal to remove the parents after spawning. As with many fish, The black neon tetra often spawns in the early morning. Raising the fry can be more difficult because of their small size. The first food will normally be protozoa (infusoria) then Daphnia is the next step. Very fine fry food can be used, graduating to slightly coarse fry food. At all ages, the black neon tetra benefits from suitably sized live food.

In the three Godfather films, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, Michael was portrayed by Al Pacino, for which he was twice-nominated for Academy Awards. Michael is the youngest son of Vito Corleone, a Sicilian immigrant who builds a Mafia empire. Upon his father's death, Michael succeeds him as the don of the Corleone crime family. In June 2003, Michael Corleone was recognized as the 11th most iconic villain in film history by the American Film Institute, although some critics consider him to be a tragic hero.  Family  Born in 1920 to Mafia don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) and his wife Carmela (Morgana King), Michael has two older brothers, Santino \\"Sonny\\" Corleone (James Caan) and Frederico \\"Fredo\\" Corleone (John Cazale), and a younger sister, Constanzia \\"Connie\\" Corleone (Talia Shire). The family consigliere, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), is their informal adoptive brother.  The Godfather  Unlike his two older brothers, Michael renounces the Corleone \\"family business\\", wanting instead to lead a more Americanized life. Vito does not want Michael to join the Corleone criminal empire either, hoping that his favorite son goes into politics. Michael enrolls in Dartmouth College, but drops out to enlist in the United States Marine Corps after the attack on Pearl Harbor, when the United States enters World War II. During the war, he fights in both the Pacific and European Theaters, and is wounded in battle. For his bravery, he receives a battlefield commission to the rank of captain, and is awarded the Silver Star and the Navy Cross. His heroics during the war are featured in Life magazine. During the summer of 1945, Michael is discharged from the Marines, unaware that Vito secretly arranged for his release. He returns home to attend his sister Connie's wedding, accompanied by Kay Adams (Diane Keaton), his college sweetheart. Michael stays for a few weeks before re-entering college without telling his family. Just before Christmas 1945, Vito is wounded in an assassination attempt by drug kingpin Virgil Sollozzo (Al Lettieri), pushing a reluctant Michael into the Mafia world he has avoided for so long. Arriving at the hospital, he finds his father unprotected and vulnerable. While awaiting Corleone reinforcements, Michael prevents a second assassination attempt on Vito by Sollozzo, then affirms his loyalty to his father. Captain Mark McCluskey (Sterling Hayden), a corrupt NYPD officer on Sollozzo's payroll, breaks Michael's jaw before more Corleone button men arrive. Sollozzo later requests that Michael broker a truce, but acting boss Sonny, suspecting a trap, refuses and demands the other Mafia families hand over Sollozzo to the Corleone family or else face war. Michael suggests taking Sollozzo's meeting but in a public place; he then proposes that he murder both Sollozzo and McCluskey. Hagen warns that killing McCluskey would violate a long-standing Mafia rule not to kill police officers, and says it would incite deadly backlash from rival Mafia families and law enforcement. Michael argues they can publicly expose McCluskey as a corrupt cop involved in the drug trade and serving as Sollozzo's bodyguard, contending that McCluskey has crossed into their world and is fair game. Sonny agrees and approves the hit. Michael meets with Sollozzo and McCluskey at an Italian restaurant in The Bronx. He retrieves a handgun that Corleone caporegime Peter Clemenza (Richard Castellano) had planted beforehand in the bathroom and kills Sollozzo and McCluskey. This ignites the New York underworld's first Mafia war in a decade. Michael escapes to Sicily and spends two years under Corleone ally Don Tommasino's (Corrado Gaipa) protection. Michael falls in love with and marries a young local woman named Apollonia Vitelli (Simonetta Stefanelli). Back in the United States, Michael's brother Sonny is murdered. After Michael is notified of Sonny's murder, he and Apollonia prepare to move to Siracusa, but she is killed by a car bomb meant for Michael. Michael returns to the United States sometime between 1949 and early 1951 and assumes Sonny's role as Vito's heir apparent. After Vito's suspicions are confirmed that Don Emilio Barzini (Richard Conte), his main rival in New York City, is the power behind Sollozzo and Tattaglia, he and Michael begin a secret, complex plot to wipe out the other New York Dons. They deliberately allow their rivals to whittle away at Corleone interests to lull them into inaction. Meanwhile, Michael convinces his father that it is time to remove the family from crime. More than a year following his return, Michael reunites with Kay and they marry. He promises her the Corleone family will be completely legitimate in five years. Within two years, they have two children, Anthony and Mary. Vito semi-retires in 1954, and Michael becomes operating head of the family. He offers to buy out casino owner Moe Greene's (Alex Rocco) stake in the Las Vegas casino that the Corleones bankrolled, intending to move the family to Nevada as part of his effort to legitimize the Corleone interests; Greene refuses to sell. Shortly before his death in 1955, Vito warns Michael that Barzini will likely attempt to assassinate Michael under the pretense of negotiating peace between the families. Whoever approaches Michael about the meeting is the traitor within the family. When longtime caporegime Salvatore Tessio (Abe Vigoda) tells Michael at his father's funeral that Barzini wants to arrange a meeting, Michael sets the plan in motion to murder the other New York Mafia heads: Barzini, Philip Tattaglia (Victor Rendina), Carmine Cuneo (Rudy Bond), and Victor Stracci (Don Costello), as well as Greene. The plot unfolds on the same day Michael stands as godfather to Connie's newborn son. Later the same day, he has Tessio and Carlo Rizzi (Gianni Russo), Connie's abusive husband who conspired in Sonny's murder, executed. In one stroke, Michael re-establishes the Corleone family as the nation's most powerful crime family, and establishes a reputation as being even more cunning and ruthless than his father. A few days later, Connie furiously accuses Michael of murdering Carlo. When challenged by Kay, Michael denies having ordered Carlo's murder. Kay, initially believing Michael, later observes him receiving his capos. Clemenza addresses Michael as \\"Don Corleone\\" and kisses his hand in the same manner that he did with Michael's father. Kay realizes Connie's accusations were true, and that Michael has become his father's successor in every way. In the novel, Kay leaves Michael, but Hagen persuades her to return.  The Godfather Part II  The Godfather Part II is set in 1958 and 1959. The Corleone family has relocated to Nevada, while capo Frank Pentangeli (Michael V. Gazzo) runs the family's operations in New York, Clemenza having died a few years before. Although Michael is the most powerful Mafia leader in the nation, he still actively works to remove the Corleone family from crime. His efforts have been largely unsuccessful, however, as his many enemies and growing obsession with revenge keep him tethered to the criminal underworld. Michael plans to finally legitimize the family by negotiating with Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg), his father's former business partner, over controlling casino operations in Cuba. Hours after Anthony's First Communion party, unseen gunmen shoot at the Corleone house, nearly killing Michael and Kay. Michael suspects Roth ordered the hit, and believes a mole within the Corleone family aided him. To uncover Roth's involvement, Michael maintains their business relationship, and orders Pentangeli to settle a dispute with Roth's business partners, the Rosato Brothers. When Pentangeli meets with them, they try to kill him, but he survives. Michael, Roth, and Fredo travel to Cuba to forge a partnership with Fulgencio Batista allowing them to operate casinos in Cuba without interference in exchange for generous payments to the Cuban government. Michael sends his bodyguard to eliminate Roth on New Year's Eve, but Cuban soldiers kill the bodyguard during the attempt. That same night, Fredo unintentionally reveals that he was the mole within the family; Michael confronts Fredo and gives him the Sicilian \\"kiss of death\\". During the New Year's Eve festivities, victorious rebel forces enter Havana, forcing Batista into exile and ruining Michael's plans. Fredo, afraid of his brother, runs off; Roth escapes to Miami. Meanwhile, Pentangeli, believing Michael had ordered a hit on him, prepares to testify against him in the Senate's investigation of organized crime. However, Michael has Pentangeli's brother Vincenzo (Salvatore Po) brought from Sicily. Just prior to the hearing, Vincenzo and Frank exchange glances. Understanding the threat, Pentangeli recants his earlier sworn statements, throwing the hearings into chaos and effectively destroying the government's case against Michael. Fredo confesses to Michael that Roth's right-hand man, Johnny Ola (Dominic Chianese), had promised to reward him for information about Michael. Fredo also reveals that he resented being \\"passed over\\" to head the family in favor of Michael, and that he withheld key information about the Senate investigation. Michael disowns Fredo, and tells his personal assassin Al Neri that nothing is to happen to his brother while their mother is alive -- the implication being that Neri is to kill Fredo after she dies. Meanwhile, Kay decides to leave Michael and take their children with her, believing Michael will always live in a world of crime and violence. Michael asks her to reconsider, but Kay reveals she aborted their unborn son because she refused to bring another of his children into the world. Enraged, Michael hits Kay in the face and banishes her from the family, taking custody of Anthony and Mary. Following their mother's death, and at Connie's behest, Michael seemingly forgives Fredo, but it is actually a ploy to draw him in closer in order to have him killed. Soon after, Neri murders Fredo on Michael's orders. At the same time, Michael sends Hagen to persuade Pentangeli to commit suicide to spare his family, and has caporegime Rocco Lampone (Tom Rosqui) kill a heavily guarded Roth at Idlewild Airport upon his return to the U.S. The film ends as Michael recalls a surprise birthday party for his father on December 7, 1941. In a flashback scene, Michael informs the family that he has dropped out of college to enlist in the Marines. Only Fredo supports Michael's decision. When Vito arrives off-screen, everyone goes to greet him except Michael, who sits alone. The film closes with Michael sitting alone in the Corleones' Lake Tahoe compound.  The Godfather Part III  The Godfather Part III is set in 1979 and 1980. Michael has moved back to New York and taken great strides to remove the family from crime. He turns over his New York criminal interests to longtime enforcer Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna). Ridden with guilt over his ruthless rise to power, he uses his wealth in an attempt to rehabilitate his reputation through numerous acts of charity, administered by a foundation named after his father. A decade earlier, he gave custody of his two children to Kay, who has since remarried. He sells his gambling interests to the other Mafia families and reorganizes his vast business holdings as the \\"Corleone Group\\". The Holy See has named him a Commander of the Order of Saint Sebastian for his charitable works. At the ceremony, Michael and Kay have an uneasy reunion after nine years. Kay supports their son Anthony's (Franc D'Ambrosio) decision to reject the \\"family business\\" and become an opera singer, and tells Michael that both she and Anthony know the truth about Fredo's death. Michael had initially wanted Anthony to either finish law school or join the family business, but consents to Anthony going his own way. Michael's new connection to the Church provides an opportunity to take over the large property company, Immobiliare. He is already its largest shareholder, and offers to buy the Vatican's 25 percent share, which will give him controlling interest. He also takes in Sonny's illegitimate son Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia), a soldier in Zasa's crew, as his proteg√©. Michael recognizes that Vincent has inherited Sonny's fiery temper and fears Vincent will suffer his father's fate. Michael also disapproves of the romance developing between him and Michael's daughter, Mary (Sofia Coppola). Michael fears that Vincent's growing involvement in the Mafia will endanger Mary, just as it did Michael's first wife, Apollonia. On the night Michael announces he is dissolving his gambling empire, Zasa wipes out most of The Commission in a helicopter attack in Atlantic City. Michael escapes with help from Vincent and Neri. Michael realizes that his old friend, Don Altobello (Eli Wallach), is the brains behind the attempt on his life. Traumatized by the attack, Michael suffers a diabetic stroke, briefly incapacitating him. (Francis Ford Coppola reveals in his audio commentary that Michael is seen drinking a lot of water in the first two films‚Äîsubtle hints that he is a diabetic.) While Michael recovers, Connie gives Vincent her consent to assassinate Zasa. Michael is angry upon discovering this, and demands that no similar orders be issued while he is alive. Michael returns to Sicily for Anthony's operatic debut at the Teatro Massimo. Suspecting that Altobello may make another attempt on his life, he has Vincent infiltrate Altobello's regime under the pretense of defecting. Michael and Kay tour Sicily together, during which Michael asks for Kay's forgiveness. Kay admits she will always love him, and they begin to rekindle their relationship. Meanwhile, the Immobiliare deal has stalled, supposedly because Pope Paul VI must personally approve it. Michael learns that the Immobiliare deal is an elaborate swindle concocted by Immobiliare chairman Licio Lucchesi (Enzo Robutti), who schemed with Vatican Bank head Archbishop Gilday (Donal Donnelly) and accountant Frederick Keinszig (Helmut Berger) to embezzle a fortune from the Vatican Bank, using Michael's \\"investment\\" to cover their tracks. Hoping to salvage the deal, Michael seeks Don Tommasino's assistance. He directs Michael to Cardinal Lamberto (Raf Vallone), the future Pope John Paul I. With Lamberto's prodding, Michael makes his first confession in 30 years, tearfully breaking down as he admits to ordering Fredo's murder. Lamberto tells Michael he deserves to suffer for his terrible sins, but that there is hope for redemption. John Paul I dies soon after being elected pope, poisoned by Gilday. Michael learns that Altobello (in league with the conspirators) has hired an assassin named Mosca (Mario Donatone) to kill him. Mosca murders Tommasino, and Michael vows before his old friend's casket to sin no more. Vincent reports that Lucchesi, working with Altobello, is behind the assassination attempts on Michael. Weary of the bloody, lonely life of a Don, Michael retires, making Vincent his successor, but not before giving him permission to retaliate. In return, Vincent agrees to end his romance with Mary. That night, Michael, reconciled with Kay and Anthony, watches his son's performance in the opera Cavalleria Rusticana. Meanwhile, Vincent orchestrates the murders of Lucchesi, Gilday and Keinszig, and Connie murders Altobello with a poisoned cannoli. After the performance, Mosca shoots Michael, and the bullet passes through his body and hits Mary, killing her. Her death breaks Michael's spirit, and he screams in agony over her body. Years later, an elderly Michael lives alone in Don Tommasino's villa. Sitting in the same courtyard where he married Apollonia, he suddenly slumps over in his chair and falls to the ground, assumed to be dead.  The Sicilian  Michael is a secondary character in Puzo's novel The Sicilian, which takes place during his first exile in Sicily. He learns from Clemenza about the legendary exploits of the novel's main character, Salvatore Guiliano (In the novel, the spelling of Salvatore Giuliano's name was intentionally changed by Puzo to \\"Guiliano\\".), and is eager to meet him, but Giuliano is murdered before the meeting can take place. Sequel novels Michael appears in Mark Winegardner's sequel novels The Godfather Returns and The Godfather's Revenge. In Godfather Returns, set roughly during the time of Godfather Part II, Michael battles with a new rival, disgruntled Corleone capo Nick Geraci, while attempting to legitimize the family. In The Godfather's Revenge, set a few years after the second film, he moves to protect his criminal empire against Geraci and the machinations of a powerful political dynasty, while dealing with his guilt over having Fredo murdered. In the latter novel, he has a relationship with actress Marguerite \\"Rita\\" Duvall in the early 1960s, but he ends it upon realizing that he is still in love with Kay.

For the majority of World War II in Europe, he was the chief of the Gestapo, the secret state police of Nazi Germany. M√ºller was central in the planning and execution of the Holocaust and attended the January 1942 Wannsee Conference, which formalised plans for deportation and genocide of all Jews in German-occupied Europe‚ÄîThe \\"Final Solution to the Jewish Question\\". He was known as \\"Gestapo M√ºller\\" to distinguish him from another SS general named Heinrich M√ºller. He was last seen in the F√ºhrerbunker in Berlin on 1 May 1945 and remains the most senior figure of the Nazi regime who was never captured or confirmed to have died. Early life and career M√ºller was born in Munich on 28 April 1900 to Catholic parents. His father had been a rural police official. M√ºller attended a Volkshochschule and completed an apprenticeship as an aircraft mechanic before the outbreak of the First World War. During the last year of the war, he served in the Luftstreitkr√§fte as a pilot for an artillery spotting unit. He was decorated several times for bravery (including the Iron Cross 1st and 2nd class, Bavarian Military Merit Cross 2nd Class with Swords and Bavarian Pilots Badge). After the war ended, he joined the Bavarian Police in 1919 as an auxiliary worker. Although not a member of the Freikorps, he was involved in the suppression of the communist risings in the early post-war years. After witnessing the shooting of hostages by the revolutionary \\"Red Army\\" in Munich during the Bavarian Soviet Republic, he acquired a lifelong hatred of communism. During the years of the Weimar Republic he was head of the Munich Political Police Department, having risen quickly through the ranks due to his spirited efforts. SS career It was under these auspices that he became acquainted with many members of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) including Heinrich Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich, although M√ºller in the Weimar period was generally seen as a supporter of the Bavarian People's Party (which at that time ruled Bavaria). On 9 March 1933, during the Nazi putsch that deposed the Bavarian government of Minister-President Heinrich Held, M√ºller advocated to his superiors using force against the Nazis. Ironically, these views aided M√ºller's rise as it guaranteed the hostility of the Nazis, thereby making M√ºller very dependent upon the patronage of Reinhard Heydrich, who in turn appreciated M√ºller's professionalism and skill as a policeman, and was aware of M√ºller's past. Once the Nazis seized power, M√ºller's knowledge of communist activities placed him in high demand; as a result he was promoted to Polizeiobersekret√§r in May 1933 and again to Criminal Inspector in November 1933. Historian Richard J. Evans wrote: \\"M√ºller was a stickler for duty and discipline, and approached the tasks he was set as if they were military commands. A true workaholic who never took a vacation, M√ºller was determined to serve the German state, irrespective of what political form it took, and believed it was everyone's duty, including his own, to obey its dictates without question.\\" Evans also records M√ºller was a regime functionary out of ambition, not out of a belief in National Socialism: An internal [Nazi] Party memorandum ... could not understand how \\"so odious an opponent of the movement\\" could become head of the Gestapo, especially since he had once referred to Hitler as \\"an immigrant unemployed house painter\\" and \\"an Austrian draft-dodger\\". Nazi jurist and former police chief, SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer Werner Best opined M√ºller represented one of the \\"finest examples\\" of the limited connection between members of the NSDAP and the police before 1933. After the Nazis came to power in 1933, Heydrich, as head of the Security Service (SD), recruited M√ºller, Franz Josef Huber and Josef Albert Meisinger, who were collectively referred to as the \\"Bajuwaren-Brigade\\" (Bavarian Brigade). M√ºller joined the SS in 1934. By 1936, with Heydrich head of the Gestapo, M√ºller was its operations chief. On 4 January 1937, an evaluation by the Nazi Party's Deputy Gauleiter of Munich-Upper Bavaria stated: This assessment did not deter Heydrich from moving M√ºller along the ranks, particularly since Heydrich believed it was an advantage not to be bound to the influence of the NSDAP. Functionaries like M√ºller were the sort of men Heydrich preferred since they were inherently committed to their \\"area of responsibility\\" and correspondingly justified any steps they deemed necessary against perceived enemies of the Nazi \\"racial community.\\" M√ºller was promoted to the rank of Standartenf√ºhrer (colonel) in 1937. Engrossing himself often in red-tape and statistics, M√ºller was a natural administrator who took solace in a \\"world of notes, memos, and regulations\\" and then received and transformed Gestapo reports of denouncements, torture, and secret executions into \\"administrative fodder.\\" Despite the expense of so much mental energy in carrying out his duties, M√ºller disliked the scholarly types and once told Walter Schellenberg that \\"intellectuals should be sent down a coal mine and blown up.\\" British author and translator Edward Crankshaw described M√ºller as \\"the arch-type non- political functionary\\" who was \\"in love with personal power and dedicated to the service of authority, the State.\\" General Walter Dornberger, the chief over the rocket research at Peenem√ºnde, (under alleged Gestapo suspicion) was one of the few to ever interview with M√ºller and characterized him as, \\"the unobtrusive type of police official who leaves no personal impression on the memory\\" but added, \\"... all I could remember was a pair of piercing grey-blue eyes, fixed on me with an unwavering scrutiny. My first impression was one of cold curiosity and extreme reserve.\\" American journalist and war correspondent, William L. Shirer, called M√ºller a \\"a dapper-looking fellow\\" but shortly thereafter described him as \\"a cold, dispassionate killer\\". Himmler biographer Peter Padfield wrote: \\"he [M√ºller] was an archetypal middle rank official: of limited imagination, non-political, non-ideological, his only fanaticism lay in an inner drive to perfection in his profession and in his duty to the state‚Äîwhich in his mind were one ... A smallish man with piercing eyes and thin lips, he was an able organiser, utterly ruthless, a man who lived for his work.\\" Such was his dedication to the job that Auschwitz Commandant Rudolf H√∂ss claimed one could reach M√ºller \\"any time of the day or night, even Sundays and public holidays.\\" Berlin February 1939: Maj. v. Schweinichen; Dr. Boor; M√ºller He was made Inspector of the Security Police for all of Austria following the 1938 Anschluss, while his close friend Franz Josef Huber took charge of the Gestapo office in Vienna. One of M√ºller's first major acts occurred during the unprecedented Kristallnacht pogrom of 9‚Äì10 November 1938, when he ordered the arrest of between 20,000‚Äì30,000 Jews. Heydrich also tasked M√ºller during the summer of 1939 to create a centrally organized agency to deal with the eventual emigration of the Jews. M√ºller became a member of the Nazi Party in 1939 for the purely opportunist reason of improving his chances of promotion and only after Himmler insisted he do it. Historian Robert Gellately does not give much credence to this apolitical image of M√ºller and cites the musings of Walter Schellenberg, who claimed during a conversation with M√ºller sometime in 1943, M√ºller lauded the Stalinist system as superior to Nazism, which he believed compromised on too much. Schellenberg even alleged when M√ºller compared Stalin against Hitler, his (M√ºller's) opinion was Stalin did things better. As Gellately relates, such a politically-oriented asseveration certainly indicates M√ºller did indeed have preferences. He was notorious, for instance, for admiring the Soviet police. While the chief of the subsequent Reich Central Office for Jewish Emigration was indeed Heydrich, it was M√ºller who took care of the office's administrative details. Shortly thereafter, M√ºller took charge of this office but then handed control over to Adolf Eichmann. Once the war began, this ended the possibility of Jewish emigration and caused the office's dissolution. Gestapo chief Left to right: Franz Josef Huber, Arthur Nebe, Heinrich Himmler, Reinhard Heydrich and M√ºller (1939) In September 1939, when the Gestapo and other police organizations were consolidated under Heydrich into the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA), M√ºller was made chief of the RSHA \\"Amt IV\\" (Office or Dept. 4): Gestapo. To distinguish him from another SS general named Heinrich M√ºller, he became known as \\"Gestapo M√ºller\\". As Gestapo chief of operations and later (September 1939 forward) head of the organization, M√ºller played a leading role in the detection and suppression of all forms of resistance to the Nazi regime. Trusted by both Heydrich and Himmler, M√ºller was pivotal in making the Gestapo the \\"central executive organ of National Socialist terror\\" according to historians Carsten Dams and Michael Stolle. Under his leadership, the Gestapo succeeded in infiltrating and to a large extent, destroying groups opposed to the Nazis, such as the underground networks of the left-wing Social Democratic Party and Communist Party. Along these lines, historian George C. Browder asserts that M√ºller's \\"expertise and his ardent hate for Communism guaranteed his future\\". When Hitler and his army chiefs asked for a pretext for the invasion of Poland in 1939, Himmler, Heydrich, and M√ºller masterminded and carried out a false flag project code- named Operation Himmler. During one of the operations, the clandestine mission to a German radio station on the Polish border, M√ºller helped collect a dozen or so condemned men from camps, who were then dressed in Polish uniforms. In exchange for their participation, the men were told by M√ºller that \\"they would be pardoned and released.\\" Instead, the men were given a lethal injection and gunshot wounds to make them appear to have been killed in action during a fake attack. These incidents (particularly the staged attack on the Gleiwitz radio station) were then used in Nazi propaganda to justify the invasion of Poland, the opening event of World War II. M√ºller (front row, to the left) and Reinhard Heydrich visiting a war cemetery in Oslo, Norway in 1941. Thereafter, M√ºller continued to rise quickly through the ranks of the SS: in October 1939 he became an SS-Oberf√ºhrer, in November 1941 ‚Äì Gruppenf√ºhrer and Lieutenant General of the police. During the Second World War, M√ºller was heavily involved in espionage and counter-espionage, particularly since the Nazi regime increasingly distrusted the military intelligence service‚Äîthe Abwehr‚Äîwhich under Admiral Wilhelm Canaris was a hotbed of activity for the German Resistance. In 1942 he successfully infiltrated the \\"Red Orchestra\\" network of Soviet spies and used it to feed false information to the Soviet intelligence services. Heydrich was M√ºller's direct superior until his assassination in 1942. For the remainder of the war, Ernst Kaltenbrunner took over as M√ºller's superior. M√ºller occupied a position in the Nazi hierarchy close to Himmler, the overall head of the Nazi police apparatus and the chief architect of the plan to exterminate the Jews of Europe, and Eichmann, the man entrusted with arranging the deportations of Jews to the Eastern ghettoes and death camps. Eichmann headed the Gestapo's \\"Office of Resettlement\\", and then its \\"Office of Jewish Affairs\\" (the RSHA Amt IV sub-section known as Referat IV B4). He was M√ºller's subordinate. M√ºller was also involved in the regime's policy towards the Jews, although Himmler and Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels drove this area of policy. On 6 October 1939 for instance, M√ºller instructed Eichmann to prepare for the deportation of some 70,000 to 80,000 Jews from the annexed Polish city of Kattowitz; an order which included the deportation of the Jews from Ostrava‚Äîboth \\"expulsion campaigns\\" had already been planned as early as September by the Gestapo or the army. Twelve days later on 18 October 1939, he told Eichmann it would soon \\"be necessary to organize the resettlement and removal of Poles and Jews into the area of the future Polish rump state centrally\\" via the RSHA. Although his chief responsibility was always police work within Germany, he was fully in charge and thus responsible to execute the extermination of the Jews of Europe. When Eichmann reported to M√ºller sometime in the middle of 1941 that he had been informed by Himmler the F√ºhrer had ordered the physical destruction of the Jews for instance, M√ºller silently nodded at his desk, indicating to Eichmann that he already knew. Correspondingly, M√ºller received detailed reports from Eichmann about the Einsatzgruppen death-squad units, which according to historian Raul Hilberg killed more than two million people, including 1.3 million Jews between 1941 and 1945. At the end of June 1941, M√ºller dispatched Eichmann to Minsk, so he could collect detailed information on the execution activities. In August 1941, M√ºller ordered these killing reports be forwarded to Hitler. Attempting to keep the brutality of the wholesale slaughter occurring in the East as quiet as possible, M√ºller sent a telegram to the Einsatzgruppen towards the end of August 1941, which explicitly instructed them \\"to prevent the crowding of spectators during the mass executions.\\" On 23 October 1941, M√ºller briefed a circular to SiPo stations which exclusively prohibited any future Jewish emigration out of German controlled territory, a directive which presaged their imminent extermination. In January 1942, he attended the Wannsee Conference at which Heydrich briefed senior officials from a number of government departments of the extermination plan, and at which Eichmann took the minutes. Once the conference concluded, M√ºller, Heydrich, and Eichmann remained afterwards for additional \\"informal chats\\". Just a couple months later in March 1942, Jews were already being systematically killed in gas vans at Chelmno and Belzec while construction was underway at Birkenau and Sobibor. Again, M√ºller sent Eichmann to relate his findings about the killing operations taking place at Chelmno; when Eichmann returned this time, he reported to M√ºller that the scene was \\"horrible\\" and added it was \\"an indescribable inferno.\\" When the first denunciations of the mass murder being carried-out by the Germans hit the Allied press during the autumn and winter of 1942, Himmler instructed M√ºller to ensure \\"all the bodies were either buried or burned.\\" Enforcement and administration of Nazi \\"racial- hygiene\\" policies were also within the purview of M√ºller's responsibilities, as a special letter he sent from Berlin to all Gestapo offices on 10 March 1942 reveals; the letter contained instructions concerning the relationship between German women and Polish civilians or prisoners-of-war who were conscripted as labor during the war, particularly in cases related to pregnancy. If both parties proved \\"racially acceptable\\" and the Polish man wanted to marry the woman, the pregnancy and relationship was allowed without punitive consequences, provided the RSHA approved after photographic evaluation of both parties and subsequent \\"Germanization\\" of the Pole occurred. For cases where one or more parties was deemed racially unfit, the Polish male would receive \\"special handling\\", an obvious Nazi euphemism for a death-sentence. In May 1942, Heydrich was assassinated in Prague by Czech soldiers sent from London. M√ºller was sent to Prague to head the investigation into Operation \\"Anthropoid\\". He succeeded through a combination of bribery and torture in locating the assassins, who killed themselves to avoid capture. Despite this success, his influence within the regime declined somewhat with the loss of his original patron, Heydrich. Nonetheless, between the time Heydrich died in 1942 and Kaltenbrunner took office in January 1943, \\"M√ºller played a central role in the organization of the Holocaust.\\" Evidence of M√ºller's intimate involvement in the Holocaust are abundant in some of the surviving documents and in the later testimony of Eichmann, who divulged that he remained in constant contact with M√ºller. Eichmann recalled how M√ºller reserved power unto himself and while he (Eichmann), arranged plenty of deportations, it was only M√ºller who could write the total number of Jews (in his orange-colored pencil) who were transported at the top of the corresponding reports. As the Red Army counteroffensive against the Germans arrayed at the Battle of Stalingrad in mid-November 1942 started to take its toll, the exigencies of war demanded an increase in arms production; M√ºller played his part by responding to and facilitating Himmler's request for an additional 35,000‚Äì40,000 forced laborers. The Gestapo Chief rounded them up from across detention centers and prisons which were not yet part of the concentration camp system and sent them to Majdanek and Auschwitz. Sometime in 1943, M√ºller was sent to Rome to pressure Fascist Italy to cooperate in relinquishing their Jews for deportation. Despite having the apparent support of Benito Mussolini, M√ºller's efforts were not very successful as influential Jewish figures within Italy were in contact with the police and the military; they successfully appealed to their (Italians and Jews) shared religious convictions and convinced them to resist Nazi pressure. In 1943 M√ºller had differences with Himmler over what to do with the growing evidence of a resistance network within the German state apparatus, particularly the Abwehr and the Foreign Office. He presented Himmler with firm evidence during February 1943, that Wilhelm Canaris was involved with the resistance; however, Himmler told him to drop the case. Offended by this, M√ºller became an ally of Martin Bormann, the head of the Nazi Party Chancellery, who was Himmler's main rival. According to the SiPo and SD official in Denmark, Rudolf Mildner, Gestapo Chief M√ºller instructed him \\"to arrest the Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning atomic physicist Niels Bohr\\" sometime during the fall of 1943; this was likely the consequence of Bohr being half-Jewish, but his scientific significance also interested officials in Berlin. Fortunately for Bohr, he was tipped off by a sympathetic German woman working for the Gestapo and was able to escape across the Kattegat Strait into Sweden with the evacuation of Jews from Denmark. Later, Mildner conveniently asserted during Allied questioning that he had disobeyed M√ºller's order and allowed Bohr to get to safety. Early in 1944, M√ºller issued the Nazi injunction known as the \\"cartridge directive\\"; this command ordered that Soviet prisoners-of-war who had assisted in the identification of detained political commissars for the purpose of their liquidation be executed on the grounds they were Geheimnistr√§ger (bearers of secrets). Instructions like these amid the numerous other crimes committed at his command made M√ºller \\"one of the most feared officials in Europe\\" during the Nazi reign. After the assassination attempt against Adolf Hitler on 20 July 1944, M√ºller was placed in charge of the arrest and interrogation of all those suspected of involvement in the resistance. Over 5,000 people were arrested and about 200 executed, including Canaris. Not long after the anti- Nazi resisters were sadistically killed, M√ºller allegedly exclaimed, \\"We won't make the same mistake as in 1918. We won't leave our internal German enemies alive.\\" In the last months of the war, M√ºller remained at his post, apparently still confident of a German victory ‚Äî he told one of his officers in December 1944 the Ardennes offensive would result in the recapture of Paris. Berlin 1945 In April 1945, he was among the last group of Nazi loyalists assembled in the F√ºhrerbunker in central Berlin as the Red Army fought its way into the city in the Battle of Berlin. One of his last tasks was the sharp interrogation of Hermann Fegelein in the cellar of the Church of the Trinity as to what he knew of Himmler's attempted peace negotiations with the Western allies behind Hitler's back. Fegelein was Himmler's SS liaison officer and was shot after Hitler had Himmler expelled from all his posts for the betrayal. Hitler's secretary, Traudl Junge, recounted seeing M√ºller on 22 April 1945 and claimed she saw him on occasion chatting with Hitler in the bunker; she also added that he (M√ºller) had assumed Kaltenbrunner's former duties as head of the RSHA. Both Junge and Oberscharf√ºhrer Rochus Misch, the telephone operator for the F√ºhrerbunker, recalled seeing M√ºller on 30 April 1945. Misch placed him in the Reich Chancellery still in full uniform. That afternoon, Hitler committed suicide. On 2 May 1945, the commander of the Berlin Defence Area, General Helmuth Weidling, surrendered to the Red Army. =Disappearance= M√ºller was last seen in the bunker on the evening of 1 May 1945, the day after Hitler's suicide. Hans Baur, Hitler's pilot, later quoted M√ºller as saying; \\"we know the Russian methods exactly. I haven't the faintest intention of being taken prisoner by the Russians.\\" From that day onwards, no trace of him has ever been found. He is the most senior member of the Nazi regime whose fate remains a mystery. However, the best evidence points to him either having been killed or committing suicide during the chaos of the fall of Berlin, and his body, if recovered, was not identified. The Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) file on M√ºller was released under the Freedom of Information Act in 2001, and documents several unsuccessful attempts by U.S. agencies to find M√ºller. The U.S. National Archives commentary on the file concludes: \\"Though inconclusive on M√ºller's ultimate fate, the file is very clear on one point. The Central Intelligence Agency and its predecessors did not know M√ºller's whereabouts at any point after the war. In other words, the CIA was never in contact with M√ºller.\\" The CIA file shows an extensive search was made for M√ºller in the months after the German surrender. The search was led by the counterespionage branch of the U.S. Office of Strategic Services (forerunner of the CIA). The search was complicated by the fact that \\"Heinrich M√ºller\\" is a very common German name. A further problem arose because \\"some of these M√ºllers, including Gestapo M√ºller, did not appear to have middle names. An additional source of confusion was that there were two different SS generals named Heinrich M√ºller.\\" In 1947, American and British agents searched the home of his wartime mistress Anna Schmid, but found nothing suggesting that he was still alive. With the onset of the Cold War and the shift of priorities to meeting the challenge of the Soviet Union, interest in pursuing missing Nazis declined. By this time, the conclusion seems to have been reached that M√ºller was most likely dead. The Royal Air Force Special Investigation Branch also had an interest in M√ºller with regard to the Stalag Luft III murders, for which he was presumed to have responsibility given his position in the Gestapo. The seizure in 1960 and subsequent trial in Israel of Adolf Eichmann sparked new interest in M√ºller's whereabouts. Although Eichmann revealed no specific information, he told his Israeli interrogators that he believed that M√ºller was still alive. The West German office in charge of the prosecution of war criminals charged the police to investigate. The possibility that M√ºller was working for the Soviet Union was considered, but no definite information was gained. M√ºller's family and his former secretary were placed under surveillance by the Allies in case he was corresponding with them. The West Germans investigated several reports of M√ºller's body being found and buried in the days after the fall of Berlin. The reports were contradictory, not wholly reliable and it was not possible to confirm any of them. One such report came from Walter L√ºders, a former member of the Volkssturm, who said he had been part of a burial unit which had found the body of an SS general in the garden of the Reich Chancellery, with the identity papers of Heinrich M√ºller. The body had been buried in a mass grave at the old Jewish Cemetery on Grosse Hamburger Strasse in the Soviet Sector. Since this location was in East Berlin in 1961, this gravesite could not be investigated, nor has there been any attempt to excavate this gravesite since the reunification of Germany. In 1961, Lieutenant-Colonel Michael Goleniewski, the Deputy Chief of Polish Military Counter Intelligence, defected to the United States. Goleniewski had worked as an interrogator of captured German officials from 1948 to 1952. He never met M√ºller, but said he had heard from his Soviet supervisors that sometime between 1950 and 1952, the Soviets had \\"picked up M√ºller and taken him to Moscow\\". The CIA tried to track down the men Goleniewski named as having worked with M√ºller in Moscow, but were unable to confirm his story. Israel also continued to pursue M√ºller: in 1967, two Israeli operatives were caught by West German police attempting to break into the Munich apartment of M√ºller's wife. In 1967, in Panama City, a man named Francis Willard Keith was accused of being M√ºller. West German diplomats pressed Panama to extradite him for trial. West German prosecutors said Sophie M√ºller, 64, had seen photos of Keith and identified him as her long-missing husband. However, Keith was released once fingerprints proved he was not M√ºller. The CIA investigation concluded: \\"There is little room for doubt that the Soviet and Czechoslovak [intelligence] services circulated rumors to the effect that M√ºller had escaped to the West ... to offset the charges that the Soviets had sheltered the criminal ... There are strong indications but no proof that M√ºller collaborated with [the Soviets]. There are also strong indications but no proof that M√ºller died [in Berlin].\\" The CIA apparently remained convinced at that time that if M√ºller had survived the war, he was being harboured within the Soviet Union. But when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 and the Soviet archives were opened, no evidence to support this belief emerged. The U.S. National Archives commentary concludes: \\"More information about M√ºller's fate might still emerge from still secret files of the former Soviet Union. The CIA file, by itself, does not permit definitive conclusions. Taking into account the currently available records, the authors of this report conclude that M√ºller most likely died in Berlin in early May 1945.\\" By the 1990s, it was in any case increasingly unlikely M√ºller, who was born in 1900, was alive even if he had survived the war. In 2008, historian Peter Longerich published a biography of Heinrich Himmler, which appeared in English translation in 2012. Longerich asserts M√ºller was with Himmler at Flensburg on 11 May, and accompanied Himmler and other SS officers in their unsuccessful attempt to escape capture by the Allies and reach Bavaria on foot. Longerich states Himmler and M√ºller parted company at Meinstadt, after which M√ºller was not seen again. Longerich provides no source for this claim, which contradicts previous accounts of M√ºller's disappearance. The source for Longerich's account appears to be the interrogation of one of Himmler's adjutants, Werner Grothmann, the transcript of which contains references to \\"M√ºller\\". In 2013 Johannes Tuchel, the head of the Memorial to the German Resistance, claimed M√ºller's body was found in August 1945 by a work crew cleaning up corpses and was one of 3,000 buried in a mass grave on the site of a former Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte. While Tuchel was confident he had solved the mystery, whether M√ºller is actually there has not been confirmed. Nonetheless, the uncertainty of M√ºller's ultimate end and/or whereabouts has only served to nourish the \\"mysterious power\\" that the Gestapo elicits even to the present. Walter Schellenberg alleged in his memoir Muller had defected to the Soviets in 1945. Schellenberg wrote in 1950 a German officer who had been a prisoner of war in Russia stated he had seen Muller in Moscow in 1948 and he had died shortly afterward. There is no reference in the memoir as to who the German officer was or any other details that might help verify this claim. = Falsified M√ºller CIC dossier = In July 1988 author Ian Sayer received, from an anonymous individual, a 427-page (photocopied) US Army Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC) file claimed it had been inadvertently released by the US National Archives. The dossier purported to confirm Heinrich M√ºller had survived the war and been retained by the CIC as an intelligence adviser. Sayer and co- author Douglas Botting were known to be working on a comprehensive history of the US Army's Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC) at that time. The alleged dossier had also come to the attention of the US Department of Justice's Nazi hunting unit, the Office of Special Investigations, who subsequently sought Sayer's opinion on the veracity of the documents. By this time the anonymous individual (later identified as Gregory Douglas) had managed to interest Time magazine and the London Times newspaper in his story. However, the dossier claims and associated materials were found to be \\"fictitious\\".

(stylized as RONA) is an American-owned Canadian retailer of home improvement and construction products and services. Founded in 1939, the company operates a mixture of company-owned and franchised retailers under multiple banners, including Rona, its big box formats Rona Home & Garden (Rona L‚ÄôEntrep√¥t in Quebec) and R√©no-D√©p√¥t, as well as smaller brands such as Rona Cashway, Marcil Centre de R√©novation, Moffatt & Powellhttp://www.naylornetwork.com/wrl/articles/toolbox.asp?aid=123110&issueID;=21923 and Dick's Lumber. In May 2016, American retailer Lowe's acquired Rona for $3.2 billion CAD. History In September 1939, Rona was founded as The Merchants of Hardware, an alliance of independent Montreal-area hardware retailers who sought the buying power to bypass wholesalers and deal directly with manufacturers. On July 20, 1960, the Ro-Na name was adopted, named after Rolland Dansereau and Napoleon Piotte, two of the founders of Les Marchands en Quincaillerie. Ro-Na member stores begin adding the Ro-Na logo to identify themselves as members of the buying co-operative.\\"Rona from 1939 to Today\\" In 1982, Rona purchased the assets of Botanix. in 1984, Rona created a purchasing alliance with Ontario-based Home Hardware Stores Ltd. through Alliance Rona Home Inc. In 1988, Rona merged with Dismat, another building materials company, to create Rona Dismat Group Inc. In 1990, Rona formed an alliance with Hardware Wholesalers, Inc. of Fort Wayne, Indiana. In 1997, ITM Entreprises S.A., a France-based group, invests $30 million in the Rona Dismat Group Inc. ITM became a shareholder and formed a purchasing alliance with Rona. In 1998, Rona stopped using the Le Quincailleur and Dismat names and introduced Rona L'express, Rona L'express Mat√©riaux and Rona Le R√©novateur R√©gional. Rona also changed its name from Rona Dismat Group Inc. to Rona Inc. In 1999, Rona opened a new warehouse adjacent to its headquarters, measuring 654,000 square feet (61,000 m¬≤), doubling its warehousing capacity. In the year 2000, Rona acquired Ontario-based Cashway Building Centres, with 66 stores. In the same year, Rona opened its online store on the rona.ca website. In 2001, Rona acquired 51 Revy Home and Garden (based in British Columbia), Revelstoke Home Centres (located in Western Canada) and Lansing (based in Ontario) stores, thus owning many more stores in the Greater Toronto Area. In 2002, Rona closed a public offering consisting of a total offering of $150.1 million of Common Shares. Rona's Common Shares are then traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol \\"RON\\". In 2003, Rona acquired R√©no-D√©p√¥t Inc. from British Kingfisher plc, including The Building Box stores. Rona also opened its third large distribution centre in Calgary, Alberta. In 2004, Rona acquired Totem Building Supplies Limited, an Alberta company. Rona also joined the Air Miles Award Program the same year, allowing customers to gain Air Miles points while shopping at the store. Two TV shows sponsored by RONA, Rona Dream Home and Ma Maison Rona were released in 2004. In 2006, Rona acquired Stephens Home Centre/Castle Inc, a company based in Sydney, Nova Scotia. Rona also acquired a majority (51%) stake in Mat√©riaux Coupal Inc as well as Curtis Lumber Building Supplies and Chester Dawe Limited, a company based in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador. In 2007, Rona acquired Dick's Lumber, a company based in Burnaby, British Columbia. In 2007, Rona acquired Noble Trade, a company based in Concord, Ontario. In 2009, My Rona Home first aired. In 2010, Rona acquired Pierceys, a company based in Nova Scotia, Plomberie Payette & Perreault, a company based in Boucherville, Quebec, Moffatt & Powell, a company based in London, Ontariohttp://www.christopherclarkwriter.com/non-fiction/2014/9/10/bizlondon- cover-story-about-moffatt-powell, Don Park Canada, and TruServ. In 2012, the U.S. hardware store chain Lowe's attempted to buy Rona; however, the deal was met with objections from Rona shareholders (particularly the Caisse de d√©p√¥t et placement du Qu√©bec) and franchisees, and was eventually called off. On February 3, 2016, Rona announced that it had accepted an offer to be acquired by Lowe's for CDN$3.2 billion, pending regulatory and shareholder approval. Post-merger, Lowe's plans to maintain Rona's retail banners, and \\"continue to employ the vast majority of its current employees and maintain key executives from Rona's strong leadership team\\". Lowe's Canada will be operated from Rona's headquarters in Boucherville, but remain under the leadership of its current CEO Sylvain Prud'homme. The purchase was closed in May 2016. In December 2016, Lowe's announced that it planned to convert selected Rona- branded stores to the Lowe's brand. In 2019, Rona removed signs from their store fronts that read \\"Truly Canadian\\" and \\"Proudly Canadian\\" after the Advertising Standards Canada council found the signs \\"conveyed an inaccurate general impression.\\" The signs were removed because Rona was acquired by American-owned Lowe's in 2016. Rona argued that their entire history was in Canada and that, besides one store located in Saint Pierre and Miquelon, all their locations are located in Canada. The council ruled that did not change the fact the company is not owned and controlled by a Canadian company. Big box stores RONA Home & Garden in Regina. Not shown: Garden Centre (left), lumber yard (right). In the 1990s, under competitive pressure from big box retailers such as The Home Depot and Lowe's, Rona established the Rona Home & Garden stores. Rona Home & Garden stores are large, ranging from , with a warehouse-style similar to the Home Depot and Lowe's. Faced with chronic under-performance in some markets outside of Quebec, Rona closed six big box stores in 2012, five in Ontario and one in British Columbia. While the Home Depot and Lowe's stores are all company owned, Rona Home & Garden stores are a combination of corporately owned and franchised, despite the massive investment required to build such a store. As big box home improvement stores entered the market, Rona countered by bringing together successful owners of small Rona affiliate stores in Quebec to invest in one or more big box format stores. Many Rona Home & Garden locations in that province thus have local ownership, a tradition of the family hardware store, and a great deal of flexibility to adapt to the market at the store level. Most of Rona's big-box format stores in the rest of Canada are entirely corporate-owned. In December 2016, Lowe's Canada announced that 40 large-format Rona stores outside of Quebec would be rebranded under the Lowe's name, as part of an effort to re- position the Rona brand for mid-size stores.

Etymology The phrase \\"101st kilometre\\" was first coined after the Soviet Union hosted the 1980 Moscow Olympics in reference to the eastern boundary of Moscow Oblast, located at from Moscow. Soviet authorities forcibly removed all \\"undesirable elements\\" from Moscow, such as known loiterers, prostitutes, and alcoholics, beyond this boundary to improve the city's image for international visitors during the events of the 1980 Olympics.  Practice  The 101st kilometre became a colloquial phrase for limits on freedom of movement under propiska, the Soviet system of controlling internal migration. During most of the Soviet era, criminals and other \\"undesirables\\" including supposedly rehabilitated political prisoners returning from the Gulags were often restricted from settling in larger urban centers such as Moscow. The propiska laws were intended in part to keep undesirable elements away from foreigners, who were usually restricted to areas within of city centers, in a similar fashion to the 1980 Olympics. The rights of an ex-inmate to move freely about the country after release from a prison would be restricted for a long period of time. Instead of regular documents, former inmates would receive a temporary substitute, a \\"wolf ticket\\" (), confining them to internal exile without the right to settle closer than to large urban centres where they would be refused the residency permit under the propiska system. In modern Russia, this 100 km restriction has been abolished ‚Äî although a version of propiska still remains ‚Äî and the expression is used in a context similar to that of boondocks.

Bowen, who summarized, based on experiments and observations of natural rocks, the sequence of crystallization of common silicate minerals from typical basaltic magma undergoing fractional crystallization (i.e. crystallization wherein early-formed crystals are removed from the magma by crystal settling, leaving behind a liquid of slightly different composition). Bowen's reaction series is able to explain why certain types of minerals tend to be found together while others are almost never associated with one another. He experimented in the early 1900s with powdered rock material that was heated until it melted and then allowed to cool to a target temperature whereupon he observed the types of minerals that formed in the rocks produced. He repeated this process with progressively cooler temperatures and the results he obtained led him to formulate his reaction series which is still accepted today as the idealized progression of minerals produced by cooling basaltic magma that undergoes fractional crystallization. Based upon Bowen's work, one can infer from the minerals present in a rock the relative conditions under which the material had formed.Klein, Cornelis and Cornelius S. Hurlbut, Jr., Manual of Mineralogy, Wiley, 20th ed. 1985, p. 476 Description Olivine weathering to iddingsite within a mantle xenolith, demonstrating the principles of the Goldich dissolution series Bowen's Reaction Series The series is broken into two branches, the continuous and the discontinuous. The minerals at the top of the illustration (given aside) are first to crystallize and so the temperature gradient can be read to be from high to low with the high temperature minerals being on the top and the low temperature ones on the bottom. The branch on the right of the illustration is the continuous one and results in progressively sodium rich plagioclase at lowering temperatures. In the discontinuous series minerals such as olivine will crystallize at a higher temperature, as magma cools. However, if they are not precipitated (settled) out, the composition of the magma does not change and as the magma further cools the olivine will recrystallise as pyroxene. Since the surface of the Earth is a low temperature environment compared to the zones of rock formation, the chart also reflects the relative stability of minerals, with the ones at bottom being most stable and the ones at top being quickest to weather, known as the Goldich dissolution series. This is because minerals are most stable in the temperature and pressure conditions closest to those under which they had formed.

He was ordained by his home Presbytery in Prince Edward Island on January 14, 1943, and became Minister of the First Presbyterian Church in Portage la Prairie, Manitoba. He retired in 1981, when he was designated \\"Minister Emeritus\\". He also served as Presbytery and Synod Moderator, and was a frequent Commissioner to the Presbyterian Church's in Canada's General Assembly. With proximity to the Church and City Hall (they are side by side), Henderson was mayor of Portage la Prairie, Manitoba from 1947 to 1966, and again from 1971 to 1974. He served on a number of committees associated to the political office. He ran as a candidate for the leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada at its leadership conventions in 1958 and 1968. He received only one vote in his first attempt, even though he was not a delegate, and none in his second. Henderson claimed that he did not vote for himself on the former occasion and it was reported to United Press International that he received a courtesy vote from the Liberal Party. He was nicknamed, in the press, as \\"one vote Henderson.\\" Henderson also ran for the leadership of the Manitoba Liberal Party on three occasions. He received 27 votes in 1961, finishing fourth out of four candidates. He fell to 16 votes in 1969, again finishing fourth out of four. In 1975, he was the only opponent of Charles Huband, losing by 381 votes to 87. He never sought election to the provincial legislature. In the 1958 federal election, Henderson was a Liberal candidate in the former riding of Portage‚ÄîNeepawa, placing a distant second.

At her death, her estate was the largest private landownership in the Hawaiian Islands, comprising approximately 9% of Hawaii's total area. The revenues from these lands are used to operate the Kamehameha Schools, which were established in 1887 according to Pauahi's will. Pauahi was married to businessman and philanthropist Charles Reed Bishop. Ancestry, birth and early life Pauahi was born in Honolulu on December 19, 1831, in Aikupika the grass hut compound of her father, Abner Kuhooheiheipahu PƒÅkƒ´ (c. 1808-1855). PƒÅkƒ´ was an alii (noble) from the island of Molokai, and son of Alii Kalani-hele-maiiluna, who descended from the alii nui (ruling monarchs) of the island of Maui. Her mother was Laura K≈çnia (c 1808-1857), the younger daughter of Ke Alii Pauli Ka≈çleiok≈´ (1767‚Äì1818), by his second wife, Kahailiopua Luahine. Ka≈çleiok≈´ was the son of KƒÅnekap≈çlei, wife of Kalani ª≈çpu ªu and Kamehameha I, and Luahine was descended from Kalaimanokaho ªowaha who had greeted Captain Cook in 1778. Pauahi was named for her aunt, Queen Pauahi (c. 1804‚Äì1826), a widow of King Kamehameha II, and given the Christian name of Bernice. In a surviving mele hƒÅnau (birth chant) for Pauahi, the names Kalaninui ªƒ´amamao and Keaweikekahiali ªiokamoku are referenced and considered the main links to the Kamehamehas as Kalaninui ªƒ´amamao was the father of Kalani ª≈çpu ªu and \\"stepfather\\" of Ke≈çua, Kamehameha I's father while Keaweikekahiali ªiokamoku was the common ancestor of both men. Pauahi's birth chant does not mention Kamehameha I himself. She was adopted at birth by Princess Kƒ´nau (who took office in the position of Kuhina Nui (regent), styled as Kaahumanu II), but was returned to her parents in 1838 when Kƒ´nau gave birth to her daughter, Victoria KamƒÅmalu. Kƒ´nau died of mumps in 1839. Pauahi began attending the Chiefs' Children's School (later called the Royal School) that same year and remained there until 1846. Her teachers were Mr. and Mrs. Cooke. Pauahi greatly enjoyed horseback riding and swimming, and she also liked music, flowers, and the outdoors. She dressed like any fashionable New York or London woman of the time. Husband Charles Reed Bishop =Marriage= It had been planned from childhood that Pauahi, born into Hawaiian royalty, would marry her hƒÅnai (adopted) brother Prince Lot KapuƒÅiwa. Pauahi married businessman Charles Reed Bishop May 4, 1850, despite the objections of her parents. Per her request, very few people attended her wedding. One of the few witnesses was Princess Elizabeth Kekaaniau, her cousin. The couple had no children of their own. They adopted a son named Keolaokalani Davis from Pauahi's cousin Princess Ruth Ke ªelik≈çlani in 1862, against the wish of Ruth's husband, but the infant died at the age of six months. In 1883, they offered to adopt William Kaiheekai Taylor (1882-1956), the infant son of Pauahi's distant cousin Lydia Ke≈çmailani Crowningburg and Wray Taylor; they had been the boy's godparents during his christening at St. Andrews. The Taylors refused to give up their first-born son but instead offered to give one of their twin daughters to the Bishops, but they decided not to accept the second offer. The child, William Edward Bishop Kaiheekai Taylor was one of the first students at the Kamehameha's Preparatory Department and would later serve as the kahu (caretaker) of the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii at  ªMauna Ala from 1947 until his death in 1956. Eligible to rule Pauahi was educated at the Royal School and was eligible to be a named heir. Prince Lot KapuƒÅiwa ruled as Kamehameha V and offered Pauahi the throne on his deathbed in 1872. But, taken aback, she replied, \\"No, no, not me; don't think of me. I don't need it.\\" The king pressed on. But she again spurned the throne: \\"Oh, no, do not think of me. There are others.\\" The king died an hour later. Pauahi's refusal to accept the crown allowed the Lunalilo to become the first elected monarch of the Hawaiian Kingdom.  Death and funeral  On October 16, 1884, at the age of 52, Pauahi died of breast cancer at Ke≈çua Hale, Honolulu. She is interred in the Kamehameha Crypt at Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii at Mauna  ªAla on O ªahu. Legacy By the time of her death in 1884, her estate consisted of 485,563 acres (which was reduced to 375,569 acres by the January 22, 1886, meeting of the Trustees of the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estate) of land across the Hawaiian Islands which she had either purchased or inherited from her parents PƒÅkƒ´ and K≈çnia, from her aunt  ªAkahi, from her cousin Ke ªelik≈çlani and other relatives. These lands were incorporated after Pauahi's death into the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estates, which funds the Kamehameha Schools to the present day. Bishop wished that a portion of her estate be used \\"to erect and maintain in the Hawaiian Islands two schools...one for boys and one girls, to be known as, and called the Kamehameha Schools.\\" She directed her five trustees to invest her estate at their discretion and use the annual income to operate the schools. When she wrote her will, only 44,000 Hawaiians were alive. After Bishop's death in 1884, her husband Charles Reed Bishop started work in carrying out her will. The original Kamehameha School for Boys was established in 1887. The girls' school was established in 1894 on a nearby campus. By 1955, the schools moved to a 600-acre (2.4 km¬≤) location in the heights above KapƒÅlama. Some time later, Kamehameha Schools established two more campuses on outer-islands: Pukalani, Maui and the Kamehameha Schools Hawaii Campus in Keaau on the island of Hawaii. Charles Reed Bishop founded the Bernice P. Bishop Museum in 1889 as another memorial to Pauahi, on the grounds of the original boys school. She was named a woman hero by The My Hero Project. =Will= Her will caused three major controversies. In 1992, a clause that all Kamehameha Schools teachers must be Protestant was challenged as illegal religious discrimination in employment by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed a decision of the district court, and found that the school had not proved that it was \\"primarily religious\\", and thus this clause violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In 1997, several conflicts of interest were charged. Trustees received up to $900,000 per year and put their own money into the investments of the estate. The Supreme Court of Hawaii was directed in the will to replacement trustees, but also ruled on many cases involving the estate. An essay by Judge Samuel Pailthorpe King and University of Hawaii William S. Richardson School of Law Professor Randall W. Roth and others was published as a series of newspaper articles, and later a book. After a number of legal battles, the trustees resigned and management was re-organized. Trustees were instructed \\"to devote a portion of each year's income to the support and education of orphans, and others in indigent circumstances, giving the preference to Hawaiians of pure or part aboriginal blood.\\" Traditionally, this was interpreted to admit almost no students that could not prove native Hawaiian ancestry. A number of lawsuits challenged this policy. One included a settlement reported to be $7 million.

Administratively, it is incorporated as a city of oblast significance. Population is  Geography  Chernihiv stands on the Desna River 150 km to the north-north-east of Kyiv . The area was served by Chernihiv Shestovitsa Airport, and during the Cold War it was the site of Chernigov air base. History The Savior Transfiguration Cathedral of Chernihiv (1030s) is the oldest in Ukraine. Chernihiv was first mentioned in the Rus'‚ÄìByzantine Treaty (907) (as (Chernigov)), but the time of establishment is not known. According to the items uncovered by archaeological excavations of a settlement which included artifacts from the Khazar Khaganate, it seems to have existed at least in the 9th century. Towards the end of the 10th century, the city probably had its own rulers. It was there that the Black Grave, one of the largest and earliest royal mounds in Eastern Europe, was excavated in the 19th century. In the southern portion of the Kievan Rus' the city was the second by importance and wealth.Nasledie Svyatoy Rusi URL accessed on January 12, 2006 From the early 11th century it was the seat of powerful Grand Principality of Chernigov, whose rulers at times vied for power with Kyivan Grand Princes, and often overthrew them and took the primary seat in Kyiv for themselves. The grand principality was the largest in Kievan Rus and included not only the Severian towns but even such remote regions as Murom, Ryazan and Tmutarakan. The golden age of Chernihiv, when the city population peaked at 25,000, lasted until 1239 when the city was sacked by the hordes of Batu Khan, which started a long period of relative obscurity. The area fell under the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1353. The city was burned again by Crimean khan Me√±li I Giray in 1482 and 1497 and in the 15th to 17th centuries it changed hands several times between Lithuania, Muscovy (1408‚Äì1420 and from 1503), and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1618‚Äì1648), where it was granted Magdeburg rights in 1623 and in 1635 became a seat of Chernihiv Voivodeship. The area's importance increased again in the middle of the 17th century during and after the Khmelnytsky Uprising. In the Hetman State Chernihiv was the city of deployment of Chernihiv Cossack regiment (both a military and territorial unit of the time). Under the 1667 Treaty of Andrusovo the legal suzerainty of the area was ceded to Tsardom of Russia, with Chernihiv remaining an important center of the autonomous Cossack Hetmanate. With the abolishment of the Hetmanate, the city became an ordinary administrative center of the Russian Empire and a capital of local administrative units. The area in general was ruled by the Governor-General appointed from Saint Petersburg, the imperial capital, and Chernihiv was the capital of local namestnichestvo (province) (from 1782), Malorosiyskaya or Little Russian (from 1797) and Chernigov Governorate (from 1808). According to the census of 1897, in the city of Chernihiv there were about 11,000 Jews out of the total population of 27,006. Their primary occupations were industrial and commercial. Many tobacco plantations and fruit gardens in the neighborhood were owned by Jews. There were 1,321 Jewish artisans in Chernihiv, including 404 tailors and seamstresses, but the demand for artisan labor was limited to the town. There were 69 Jewish day-laborers, almost exclusively teamsters. But few were engaged in the factories.jewishencyclopedia.com Copy from 12-volume Jewish Encyclopedia, which was originally published between 1901-1906. During World War II, Chernihiv was occupied by the German Army from 9 September 1941 to 21 September 1943. The statue of Lenin on Myru Avenue was toppled on February 21, 2014, as part of the demolitions of the statues of Lenin in Ukraine. Architecture Pyatnytska Church of Saint Paraskevi (c. 1201, restored after World War II). Eletsky monastery cathedral was modeled after that of Kyiv Pechersk Lavra. Note the contrast between its austere 12th- century walls and baroque 17th-century domes. Archbishop's residence in Chernihiv Chernihiv Museum of Arts Regimental Chancellery building Church of St. Michael and Fedir in Chernihiv Monument to Hetman Mazepa by Giennadij Jerszow Chernihiv's architectural monuments chronicle the two most flourishing periods in the city's history - those of Kievan Rus' (11th and 12th centuries) and of the Cossack Hetmanate (late 17th and early 18th centuries.) The oldest church in the city and one of the oldest churches in Ukraine is the 5-domed Transfiguration Cathedral, commissioned in the early 1030s by Mstislav the Bold and completed several decades later by his brother, Yaroslav the Wise. The Cathedral of Sts Boris and Gleb, dating from the mid-12th century, was much rebuilt in succeeding periods, before being restored to its original shape in the 20th century. Likewise built in brick, it has a single dome and six pillars. The crowning achievement of Chernihiv masters was the exquisite Pyatnytska Church, constructed at the turn of the 12th and 13th centuries. This graceful building was seriously damaged in the Second World War; its original medieval outlook was reconstructed to a design by Peter Baranovsky. The earliest residential buildings in the downtown date from the late 17th century, a period when a Cossack regiment was deployed there. Two most representative residences are those of Polkovnyk Lyzohub (1690s) and Polkovnyk Polubutok (18th century). The former mansion, popularly known as the Mazepa House, used to contain the regiment's chancellery. One of the most profusely decorated Cossack structures is undoubtedly the ecclesiastical collegium, surmounted by a bell-tower (1702). The archbishop's residence was constructed nearby in the 1780s. St Catherine Church (1715), with its 5 gilded pear domes, traditional for Ukrainian architecture, is thought to have been intended as a memorial to the regiment's exploits during the storm of Azov in 1696. =Monasteries= All through the most trying periods of its history, Chernihiv retained its ecclesiastical importance as the seat of bishopric or archbishopric. At the outskirts of the modern city lie two ancient cave monasteries, formerly used as the bishops' residences. The caves of the Eletsky Monastery are said to predate those of the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra (Kyiv Monastery of the Caves). Its magnificent 6-pillared cathedral was erected at the turn of the 11th and 12th centuries; some traces of its 750-year-old murals may still be seen in the interior. After the domes collapsed in 1611, they were augmented and reconstructed in the Ukrainian baroque style. The wall, monastic cells, and bell-tower all date from the 17th century. The nearby mother superior's house is thought to be the oldest residential building in the Left-Bank Ukraine. The cloister's holiest icon used to be that of Theotokos, who made her epiphany to Svyatoslav of Chernigov on 6 February 1060. The icon, called Eletskaya after the fir wood it was painted upon, was taken to Moscow by Svyatoslav's descendants, the Baryatinsky family, in 1579. The nearby Chernihiv Glory Memorial we can find Saint Anthony Caves of Saint Elijah and the Holy Trinity features a small eponymous church, which was constructed 800 years ago. The roomy Trinity cathedral, one of the most imposing monuments of the Cossack baroque, was erected between 1679 and 1689. Its refectory, with the adjoining church of Presentation to the Temple, was finished by 1679. There are also the 17th-century towered walls, monastic cells, and the five-tiered belfry from the 1780s. Other historic abbeys may be visited in the vicinity of Chernihiv; those in Kozelets and Hustynya contain superb samples of Ukrainian national architecture. Education Chernihiv National University of Technology Chernihiv has a Chernihiv National University of Technology, Chernihiv State Technological University and Taras Shevchenko National University \\"Chernihiv College\\". Transport = Train = Chernihiv Ovruch railway in Chernihiv Chernihiv has a nice train station with bus station called Chernihiv Ovruch railway. Narrow gauge railway of 76 versts was laid from the Kruty station of the Moscow Kyiv-Voronezh railway towards Chernihiv. In 1893, on the left bank of the Desna River, in the area of a modern automobile bridge, a railway station was built along the Kyiv highway. Passengers were delivered here from the city and back by horse transport. In 1925, traffic was opened on the Nizhyn - Chernigov section of the Southwest Railway. But the appearance of railway transport in Chernihiv was postponed until 1928 (the bridge over the Desna River was not ready and the trains still arrived on the left bank, where the old narrow-gauge railway station was located, from where passengers got to Chernihiv by road bridge). According to 2006 data, the volume of freight traffic is 84,737 wagons per year. Over 4.5 million passengers are transported each year. However, the condition of the rolling stock and the quality of the services provided do not meet modern requirements. Since the introduction of the new high-speed train timetable, the trailed wagons of the 93/94 Chernigov - Odessa train were canceled. As of 2015, regular trains Minsk - Odessa, St. Petersburg - Kyiv / Kharkiv run through Chernihiv, and there are direct connections with Moscow. Trains to Crimea (Simferopol, Feodosia) were canceled from December 27, 2014. = Air transport = The area was served by Chernihiv Shestovitsa Airport, and during the Cold War it was the site of Chernigov air base. The close airport is in Kyiv at the Boryspil Airport located away, and the smaller, municipally owned Zhulyany Airport located 158.7 km away on the southern outskirts of the city of Kyiv. = Bus = The best way here from Kyiv is on a marshrutka from Lisova metro station (100uah, two hours, around every 30 minutes), which drop off outside McDonald's (on pr Pobedy). Buses for Novhorod-Siversky leave hourly from Chernihiv's Central bus station (65uah, three hours), located near the Chernihiv train station. = Local public transport = Public transport includes buses and trolleybuses. There is no direct connection between railway station and Chernihiv-1 bus station to the most central sights on the Val - you will have to take any trolleybus or bus from the station to crossing of Prospekt Mira and Prospekt Pobedy (Hotel Ukraine stop; look for the end of the boulevard along Prospekt Mira near it), and than walk through historical centre a little. Trolleybus 1 and bus 38 will take you even one stop further, to Drama Theater stop near Pyatnickaya church, but no further. Consult map, as different routes come to Hotel \\"Ukraine\\" from different sides, you will have to walk along Prospekt Mira along its continuation after boulevard ends.

The Laplace operator is the most famous example of an elliptic operator. In the theory of partial differential equations, elliptic operators are differential operators that generalize the Laplace operator. They are defined by the condition that the coefficients of the highest-order derivatives be positive, which implies the key property that the principal symbol is invertible, or equivalently that there are no real characteristic directions. Elliptic operators are typical of potential theory, and they appear frequently in electrostatics and continuum mechanics. Elliptic regularity implies that their solutions tend to be smooth functions (if the coefficients in the operator are smooth). Steady-state solutions to hyperbolic and parabolic equations generally solve elliptic equations.

In many applications, this condition is not strong enough, and instead a uniform ellipticity condition may be imposed for operators of order m = 2k: : (-1)^k\\\\sum_{\\\\alpha = 2k} a_\\\\alpha(x) \\\\xi^\\\\alpha > C \\\\xi^{2k},\\\\, where C is a positive constant. Note that ellipticity only depends on the highest-order terms.Note that this is sometimes called strict ellipticity, with uniform ellipticity being used to mean that an upper bound exists on the symbol of the operator as well. It is important to check the definitions the author is using, as conventions may differ. See, e.g., Evans, Chapter 6, for a use of the first definition, and Gilbarg and Trudinger, Chapter 3, for a use of the second. A nonlinear operator : L(u) = F(x, u, (\\\\partial^\\\\alpha u)_{\\\\alpha \\\\le m})\\\\, is elliptic if its first-order Taylor expansion with respect to u and its derivatives about any point is a linear elliptic operator. ;Example 1: The negative of the Laplacian in Rd given by :: \\\\- \\\\Delta u = -\\\\sum_{i=1}^d \\\\partial_i^2u\\\\, :is a uniformly elliptic operator. The Laplace operator occurs frequently in electrostatics. If œÅ is the charge density within some region Œ©, the potential Œ¶ must satisfy the equation :: \\\\- \\\\Delta \\\\Phi = 4\\\\pi\\\\rho.\\\\, ;Example 2: Given a matrix-valued function A(x) which is symmetric and positive definite for every x, having components aij, the operator :: Lu = -\\\\partial_i\\\\left(a^{ij}(x)\\\\partial_ju\\\\right) + b^j(x)\\\\partial_ju + cu\\\\, :is elliptic. This is the most general form of a second-order divergence form linear elliptic differential operator. The Laplace operator is obtained by taking A = I. These operators also occur in electrostatics in polarized media. ;Example 3: For p a non-negative number, the p-Laplacian is a nonlinear elliptic operator defined by :: L(u) = -\\\\sum_{i = 1}^d\\\\partial_i\\\\left( abla u^{p - 2}\\\\partial_i u\\\\right).\\\\, :A similar nonlinear operator occurs in glacier mechanics. The Cauchy stress tensor of ice, according to Glen's flow law, is given by ::\\\\tau_{ij} = B\\\\left(\\\\sum_{k,l = 1}^3\\\\left(\\\\partial_lu_k\\\\right)^2\\\\right)^{-\\\\frac{1}{3}}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\partial_ju_i + \\\\partial_iu_j\\\\right)\\\\, :for some constant B. The velocity of an ice sheet in steady state will then solve the nonlinear elliptic system ::\\\\sum_{j = 1}^3\\\\partial_j\\\\tau_{ij} + \\\\rho g_i - \\\\partial_ip = Q,\\\\, :where œÅ is the ice density, g is the gravitational acceleration vector, p is the pressure and Q is a forcing term. Elliptic regularity theorem Let L be an elliptic operator of order 2k with coefficients having 2k continuous derivatives. The Dirichlet problem for L is to find a function u, given a function f and some appropriate boundary values, such that Lu = f and such that u has the appropriate boundary values and normal derivatives. The existence theory for elliptic operators, using G√•rding's inequality and the Lax‚ÄìMilgram lemma, only guarantees that a weak solution u exists in the Sobolev space Hk. This situation is ultimately unsatisfactory, as the weak solution u might not have enough derivatives for the expression Lu to even make sense. The elliptic regularity theorem guarantees that, provided f is square-integrable, u will in fact have 2k square-integrable weak derivatives. In particular, if f is infinitely-often differentiable, then so is u. Any differential operator exhibiting this property is called a hypoelliptic operator; thus, every elliptic operator is hypoelliptic. The property also means that every fundamental solution of an elliptic operator is infinitely differentiable in any neighborhood not containing 0. As an application, suppose a function f satisfies the Cauchy‚ÄìRiemann equations. Since the Cauchy-Riemann equations form an elliptic operator, it follows that f is smooth. General definition Let D be a (possibly nonlinear) differential operator between vector bundles of any rank. Take its principal symbol \\\\sigma_\\\\xi(D) with respect to a one- form \\\\xi. (Basically, what we are doing is replacing the highest order covariant derivatives abla by vector fields \\\\xi.) We say D is weakly elliptic if \\\\sigma_\\\\xi(D) is a linear isomorphism for every non-zero \\\\xi. We say D is (uniformly) strongly elliptic if for some constant c > 0, :\\\\left([\\\\sigma_\\\\xi(D)](v), v\\\\right) \\\\geq c\\\\v\\\\^2 for all \\\\\\\\xi\\\\=1 and all v. It is important to note that the definition of ellipticity in the previous part of the article is strong ellipticity. Here (\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot) is an inner product. Notice that the \\\\xi are covector fields or one-forms, but the v are elements of the vector bundle upon which D acts. The quintessential example of a (strongly) elliptic operator is the Laplacian (or its negative, depending upon convention). It is not hard to see that D needs to be of even order for strong ellipticity to even be an option. Otherwise, just consider plugging in both \\\\xi and its negative. On the other hand, a weakly elliptic first-order operator, such as the Dirac operator can square to become a strongly elliptic operator, such as the Laplacian. The composition of weakly elliptic operators is weakly elliptic. Weak ellipticity is nevertheless strong enough for the Fredholm alternative, Schauder estimates, and the Atiyah‚ÄìSinger index theorem. On the other hand, we need strong ellipticity for the maximum principle, and to guarantee that the eigenvalues are discrete, and their only limit point is infinity.

In mathematics, the braid group on strands (denoted B_n), also known as the Artin braid group, is the group whose elements are equivalence classes of -braids (e.g. under ambient isotopy), and whose group operation is composition of braids (see ). Example applications of braid groups include knot theory, where any knot may be represented as the closure of certain braids (a result known as Alexander's theorem); in mathematical physics where Artin's canonical presentation of the braid group corresponds to the Yang‚ÄìBaxter equation (see ); and in monodromy invariants of algebraic geometry. Introduction In this introduction let ; the generalization to other values of will be straightforward. Consider two sets of four items lying on a table, with the items in each set being arranged in a vertical line, and such that one set sits next to the other. (In the illustrations below, these are the black dots.) Using four strands, each item of the first set is connected with an item of the second set so that a one-to-one correspondence results. Such a connection is called a braid. Often some strands will have to pass over or under others, and this is crucial: the following two connections are different braids: : { valign=\\"centre\\" -----  The braid sigma 1‚àí1  is different from The braid sigma 1 } On the other hand, two such connections which can be made to look the same by \\"pulling the strands\\" are considered the same braid: : { valign=\\"centre\\" -----  The braid sigma 1‚àí1  is the same as  Another representation of sigma 1‚àí1 } All strands are required to move from left to right; knots like the following are not considered braids: : { valign=\\"centre\\" -----  Not a braid  is not a braid } Any two braids can be composed by drawing the first next to the second, identifying the four items in the middle, and connecting corresponding strands: : { valign=\\"centre\\" -----  File:braid s3.png  composed with  File:braid s2.png  yields  File:braid s3s2.png } Another example: : { valign=\\"centre\\" -----  File:braid s1 inv s3 inv.png  composed with  File:braid s1 s3 inv.png  yields  File:braid s3 inv squared.png } The composition of the braids and is written as . The set of all braids on four strands is denoted by B_4. The above composition of braids is indeed a group operation. The identity element is the braid consisting of four parallel horizontal strands, and the inverse of a braid consists of that braid which \\"undoes\\" whatever the first braid did, which is obtained by flipping a diagram such as the ones above across a vertical line going through its centre. (The first two example braids above are inverses of each other.)  Applications  Braid theory has recently been applied to fluid mechanics, specifically to the field of chaotic mixing in fluid flows. The braiding of (2 + 1)-dimensional space-time trajectories formed by motion of physical rods, periodic orbits or \\"ghost rods\\", and almost-invariant sets has been used to estimate the topological entropy of several engineered and naturally occurring fluid systems, via the use of Nielsen‚ÄìThurston classification. Another field of intense investigation involving braid groups and related topological concepts in the context of quantum physics is in the theory and (conjectured) experimental implementation of so-called anyons. These may well end up forming the basis for error-corrected quantum computing and so their abstract study is currently of fundamental importance in quantum information. Formal treatment To put the above informal discussion of braid groups on firm ground, one needs to use the homotopy concept of algebraic topology, defining braid groups as fundamental groups of a configuration space. Alternatively, one can define the braid group purely algebraically via the braid relations, keeping the pictures in mind only to guide the intuition. To explain how to reduce a braid group in the sense of Artin to a fundamental group, we consider a connected manifold X of dimension at least 2. The symmetric product of n copies of X means the quotient of X^n, the n-fold Cartesian product of X by the permutation action of the symmetric group on n strands operating on the indices of coordinates. That is, an ordered n-tuple is in the same orbit as any other that is a re-ordered version of it. A path in the n-fold symmetric product is the abstract way of discussing n points of X, considered as an unordered n-tuple, independently tracing out n strings. Since we must require that the strings never pass through each other, it is necessary that we pass to the subspace Y of the symmetric product, of orbits of n-tuples of distinct points. That is, we remove all the subspaces of X^n defined by conditions x_i = x_j for all 1\\\\le i. This is invariant under the symmetric group, and Y is the quotient by the symmetric group of the non-excluded n-tuples. Under the dimension condition Y will be connected. With this definition, then, we can call the braid group of X with n strings the fundamental group of Y (for any choice of base point - this is well-defined up to isomorphism). The case where X is the Euclidean plane is the original one of Artin. In some cases it can be shown that the higher homotopy groups of Y are trivial. =Closed braids= When X is the plane, the braid can be closed, i.e., corresponding ends can be connected in pairs, to form a link, i.e., a possibly intertwined union of possibly knotted loops in three dimensions. The number of components of the link can be anything from 1 to n, depending on the permutation of strands determined by the link. A theorem of J. W. Alexander demonstrates that every link can be obtained in this way as the \\"closure\\" of a braid. Compare with string links. Different braids can give rise to the same link, just as different crossing diagrams can give rise to the same knot. In 1935, Andrey Markov Jr. described two moves on braid diagrams that yield equivalence in the corresponding closed braids. A single-move version of Markov's theorem, was published by in 1997. Vaughan Jones originally defined his polynomial as a braid invariant and then showed that it depended only on the class of the closed braid. The Markov theorem gives necessary and sufficient conditions under which the closures of two braids are equivalent links. = Braid index = The \\"braid index\\" is the least number of strings needed to make a closed braid representation of a link. It is equal to the least number of Seifert circles in any projection of a knot. History Braid groups were introduced explicitly by Emil Artin in 1925, although (as Wilhelm Magnus pointed out in 1974) they were already implicit in Adolf Hurwitz's work on monodromy from 1891. Braid groups may be described by explicit presentations, as was shown by Emil Artin in 1947. Braid groups are also understood by a deeper mathematical interpretation: as the fundamental group of certain configuration spaces. As Magnus says, Hurwitz gave the interpretation of a braid group as the fundamental group of a configuration space (cf. braid theory), an interpretation that was lost from view until it was rediscovered by Ralph Fox and Lee Neuwirth in 1962. Basic properties =Generators and relations= Consider the following three braids: { -----  File:braid s1.png  File:braid s2.png  File:braid s3.png -----  \\\\sigma_1  \\\\sigma_2  \\\\sigma_3 } Every braid in B_4 can be written as a composition of a number of these braids and their inverses. In other words, these three braids generate the group B_4. To see this, an arbitrary braid is scanned from left to right for crossings; beginning at the top, whenever a crossing of strands i and i+1 is encountered, \\\\sigma_i or \\\\sigma_i^{-1} is written down, depending on whether strand i moves under or over strand i+1. Upon reaching the right end, the braid has been written as a product of the \\\\sigma's and their inverses. It is clear that ::(i) \\\\sigma_1 \\\\sigma_3 = \\\\sigma_3 \\\\sigma_1, while the following two relations are not quite as obvious: ::(iia) \\\\sigma_1 \\\\sigma_2 \\\\sigma_1 = \\\\sigma_2 \\\\sigma_1 \\\\sigma_2, ::(iib) \\\\sigma_2 \\\\sigma_3 \\\\sigma_2 = \\\\sigma_3 \\\\sigma_2 \\\\sigma_3 (these relations can be appreciated best by drawing the braid on a piece of paper). It can be shown that all other relations among the braids \\\\sigma_1, \\\\sigma_2 and \\\\sigma_3 already follow from these relations and the group axioms. Generalising this example to n strands, the group B_n can be abstractly defined via the following presentation: :B_n= \\\\left \\\\langle \\\\sigma_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\sigma_{n-1}\\\\mid \\\\sigma_i \\\\sigma_{i+1} \\\\sigma_i = \\\\sigma_{i+1} \\\\sigma_i \\\\sigma_{i+1}, \\\\sigma_i \\\\sigma_j=\\\\sigma_j\\\\sigma_i \\\\right \\\\rangle, where in the first group of relations 1 \\\\le i\\\\le n-2 and in the second group of relations, i-j\\\\ge 2. This presentation leads to generalisations of braid groups called Artin groups. The cubic relations, known as the braid relations, play an important role in the theory of Yang‚ÄìBaxter equations. =Further properties= * The braid group B_1 is trivial, B_2 is an infinite cyclic group \\\\Z, and B_3 is isomorphic to the knot group of the trefoil knot ‚Äì in particular, it is an infinite non-abelian group. * The -strand braid group B_n embeds as a subgroup into the (n+1)-strand braid group B_{n+1} by adding an extra strand that does not cross any of the first strands. The increasing union of the braid groups with all n \\\\ge 1 is the infinite braid group B_{\\\\infty}. * All non-identity elements of B_n have infinite order; i.e., B_n is torsion-free. *There is a left-invariant linear order on B_n called the Dehornoy order. * For n\\\\ge 3, B_n contains a subgroup isomorphic to the free group on two generators. * There is a homomorphism B_n \\\\to \\\\Z defined by . So for instance, the braid is mapped to . This map corresponds to the abelianization of the braid group. Since , then is the identity if and only if k=0. This proves that the generators have infinite order. Interactions =Relation with symmetric group and the pure braid group= By forgetting how the strands twist and cross, every braid on strands determines a permutation on elements. This assignment is onto and compatible with composition, and therefore becomes a surjective group homomorphism from the braid group onto the symmetric group. The image of the braid œÉi ‚àà is the transposition . These transpositions generate the symmetric group, satisfy the braid group relations, and have order 2. This transforms the Artin presentation of the braid group into the Coxeter presentation of the symmetric group: :S_n = \\\\left \\\\langle s_1,\\\\ldots,s_{n-1} s_i s_{i+1} s_i=s_{i+1} s_i s_{i+1}, s_i s_j = s_j s_i \\\\text{ for } i-j\\\\geq 2, s_i^2=1 \\\\right\\\\rangle. The kernel of the homomorphism is the subgroup of called the pure braid group on strands and denoted . In a pure braid, the beginning and the end of each strand are in the same position. Pure braid groups fit into a short exact sequence : 1\\\\to F_{n-1} \\\\to P_n \\\\to P_{n-1}\\\\to 1. This sequence splits and therefore pure braid groups are realized as iterated semi-direct products of free groups. =Relation between B_3 and the modular group= B_3 is the universal central extension of the modular group. The braid group B_3 is the universal central extension of the modular group \\\\mathrm{PSL}(2, \\\\Z), with these sitting as lattices inside the (topological) universal covering group :\\\\overline{\\\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\\\R)} \\\\to \\\\mathrm{PSL}(2,\\\\R). Furthermore, the modular group has trivial center, and thus the modular group is isomorphic to the quotient group of B_3 modulo its center, Z(B_3), and equivalently, to the group of inner automorphisms of B_3. Here is a construction of this isomorphism. Define :a = \\\\sigma_1 \\\\sigma_2 \\\\sigma_1, \\\\quad b = \\\\sigma_1 \\\\sigma_2. From the braid relations it follows that a^2 = b^3. Denoting this latter product as c, one may verify from the braid relations that :\\\\sigma_1 c \\\\sigma_1^{-1} = \\\\sigma_2 c \\\\sigma_2^{-1}=c implying that c is in the center of B_3. Let C denote the subgroup of B_3 generated by , since , it is a normal subgroup and one may take the quotient group . We claim ; this isomorphism can be given an explicit form. The cosets and map to :\\\\sigma_1C \\\\mapsto R=\\\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 1  0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\qquad \\\\sigma_2C \\\\mapsto L^{-1}=\\\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0  -1 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} where and are the standard left and right moves on the Stern‚ÄìBrocot tree; it is well known that these moves generate the modular group. Alternately, one common presentation for the modular group is :\\\\langle v,p\\\\, \\\\, v^2=p^3=1\\\\rangle where :v=\\\\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1  -1 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix}, \\\\qquad p=\\\\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1  -1 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}. Mapping to and to yields a surjective group homomorphism . The center of is equal to , a consequence of the facts that is in the center, the modular group has trivial center, and the above surjective homomorphism has kernel . =Relationship to the mapping class group and classification of braids= The braid group can be shown to be isomorphic to the mapping class group of a punctured disk with punctures. This is most easily visualized by imagining each puncture as being connected by a string to the boundary of the disk; each mapping homomorphism that permutes two of the punctures can then be seen to be a homotopy of the strings, that is, a braiding of these strings. Via this mapping class group interpretation of braids, each braid may be classified as periodic, reducible or pseudo-Anosov. =Connection to knot theory= If a braid is given and one connects the first left-hand item to the first right-hand item using a new string, the second left-hand item to the second right-hand item etc. (without creating any braids in the new strings), one obtains a link, and sometimes a knot. Alexander's theorem in braid theory states that the converse is true as well: every knot and every link arises in this fashion from at least one braid; such a braid can be obtained by cutting the link. Since braids can be concretely given as words in the generators , this is often the preferred method of entering knots into computer programs. = Computational aspects = The word problem for the braid relations is efficiently solvable and there exists a normal form for elements of in terms of the generators . (In essence, computing the normal form of a braid is the algebraic analogue of \\"pulling the strands\\" as illustrated in our second set of images above.) The free GAP computer algebra system can carry out computations in if the elements are given in terms of these generators. There is also a package called CHEVIE for GAP3 with special support for braid groups. The word problem is also efficiently solved via the Lawrence‚ÄìKrammer representation. In addition to the word problem, there are several known hard computational problems that could implement braid groups, applications in cryptography have been suggested. Actions In analogy with the action of the symmetric group by permutations, in various mathematical settings there exists a natural action of the braid group on -tuples of objects or on the -folded tensor product that involves some \\"twists\\". Consider an arbitrary group and let be the set of all -tuples of elements of whose product is the identity element of . Then acts on in the following fashion: : \\\\sigma_i \\\\left (x_1,\\\\ldots,x_{i-1},x_i, x_{i+1},\\\\ldots, x_n \\\\right)= \\\\left (x_1,\\\\ldots, x_{i-1}, x_{i+1}, x_{i+1}^{-1}x_i x_{i+1}, x_{i+2},\\\\ldots,x_n \\\\right ). Thus the elements and exchange places and, in addition, is twisted by the inner automorphism corresponding to ‚Äî this ensures that the product of the components of remains the identity element. It may be checked that the braid group relations are satisfied and this formula indeed defines a group action of on . As another example, a braided monoidal category is a monoidal category with a braid group action. Such structures play an important role in modern mathematical physics and lead to quantum knot invariants. =Representations= Elements of the braid group can be represented more concretely by matrices. One classical such representation is Burau representation, where the matrix entries are single variable Laurent polynomials. It had been a long-standing question whether Burau representation was faithful, but the answer turned out to be negative for . More generally, it was a major open problem whether braid groups were linear. In 1990, Ruth Lawrence described a family of more general \\"Lawrence representations\\" depending on several parameters. In 1996, Chetan Nayak and Frank Wilczek posited that in analogy to projective representations of , the projective representations of the braid group have a physical meaning for certain quasiparticles in the fractional quantum hall effect. Around 2001 Stephen Bigelow and Daan Krammer independently proved that all braid groups are linear. Their work used the Lawrence‚ÄìKrammer representation of dimension n(n-1)/2 depending on the variables and . By suitably specializing these variables, the braid group B_n may be realized as a subgroup of the general linear group over the complex numbers. Infinitely generated braid groups There are many ways to generalize this notion to an infinite number of strands. The simplest way is to take the direct limit of braid groups, where the attaching maps f \\\\colon B_n \\\\to B_{n+1} send the n-1 generators of B_{n} to the first n-1 generators of B_{n+1} (i.e., by attaching a trivial strand). Paul Fabel has shown that there are two topologies that can be imposed on the resulting group each of whose completion yields a different group. One is a very tame group and is isomorphic to the mapping class group of the infinitely punctured disk--a discrete set of punctures limiting to the boundary of the disk. The second group can be thought of the same as with finite braid groups. Place a strand at each of the points (0, 1/n) and the set of all braids--where a braid is defined to be a collection of paths from the points (0, 1/n, 0) to the points (0, 1/n, 1) so that the function yields a permutation on endpoints --is isomorphic to this wilder group. An interesting fact is that the pure braid group in this group is isomorphic to both the inverse limit of finite pure braid groups P_n and to the fundamental group of the Hilbert cube minus the set :\\\\\\\\{(x_i)_{i\\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}} \\\\mid x_i=x_j\\\\text{ for some }i e j\\\\\\\\}. Cohomology The cohomology of a group G is defined as the cohomology of the corresponding Eilenberg‚ÄìMacLane classifying space, K(G, 1), which is a CW complex uniquely determined by G up to homotopy. A classifying space for the braid group B_n is the th unordered configuration space of \\\\R^2, that is, the set of n distinct unordered points in the plane: :\\\\operatorname{UConf}_n(\\\\R^2) = \\\\\\\\{ \\\\\\\\{u_1, ..., u_n\\\\\\\\} : u_i \\\\in \\\\R^2, u_i eq u_j \\\\text{ for } i eq j \\\\\\\\}. So by definition : H^*(B_n) = H^*(K(B_n, 1)) = H^*(\\\\operatorname{UConf}_n(\\\\R^2)). The calculations for coefficients in \\\\Z/2\\\\Z can be found in Fuks (1970). Similarly, a classifying space for the pure braid group P_n is \\\\operatorname{Conf}_n(\\\\R^2), the th ordered configuration space of \\\\R^2. In 1968 Vladimir Arnold showed that the integral cohomology of the pure braid group P_n is the quotient of the exterior algebra generated by the collection of degree-one classes \\\\omega_{ij} \\\\; \\\\; 1 \\\\leq i < j \\\\leq n, subject to the relations :\\\\omega_{k,\\\\ell} \\\\omega_{\\\\ell,m} + \\\\omega_{\\\\ell,m} \\\\omega_{m,k} + \\\\omega_{m,k} \\\\omega_{k,\\\\ell} =0.

Julian Baltazar J√≥zef Marchlewski (17 May 1866 ‚Äì 22 March 1925) was a Polish communist politician, revolutionary activist, publicist and chairman of the Provisional Polish Revolutionary Committee. He was also known under the aliases Karski and Kujawiak. Life and career Julian Marchlewski was born in W≈Çoc≈Çawek into a Polish family. In 1889 he co-founded the Polish Workers' Union. In 1893 he co-founded the Social Democratic Party of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania with Rosa Luxemburg. He took part in the Russian Revolution of 1905 in the Polish territories. In 1906, he joined the Bolsheviks. After the failure of the revolution he emigrated to Germany. During World War I, he participated in the German social democratic movement and was a co-founder of its left-wing. He was arrested and later exchanged with Russia for a German spy. In 1919, during the Polish-Soviet War, he took part in the negotiations with Poland. During the Red Army counterattack under Mikhail Tukhachevsky, he headed the Polish Provisional Revolutionary Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Rewolucyjny Polski) in Bia≈Çystok in 1920, which planned to declare the Polish Soviet Socialist Republic. He was the first rector of the Communist University of the National Minorities of the West. As an economist, he was an expert in agriculture and took part in the preparation of the Bolshevik program with respect to the peasantry. He published a number of scientific and ideological works. He died near Nervi, Italy in 1925 during a vacation.

He was a practitioner of the Piedmont blues, which was popular in the southeastern United States in the 1920s and 1930s. He was sometimes credited as Dipper Boy Council and promoted as \\"The Devil's Daddy-in-Law\\". Biography Born in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, to Harrie and Lizzie Council, he began his musical career on the streets of Chapel Hill in the 1920s, performing with two brothers, Leo and Thomas Strowd, as the Chapel Hillbillies. In the late 1920s and early 1930s he and Blind Boy Fuller busked in the Chapel Hill area.Harris 1994, p. 133. Council recorded twice for ARC at sessions with Fuller in the mid-1930s, all examples of the Piedmont style. Council suffered a stroke in the late 1960s, which partially paralyzed his throat muscles and slowed his motor skills but did not significantly damage his cognitive abilities. The folklorist Peter B. Lowry attempted to record him one afternoon in 1970, but Council never regained his singing or playing abilities. Accounts say that he remained sharp in mind. Council died in 1976 of a heart attack, after moving to Sanford, North Carolina. He was buried at White Oak AME Zion Cemetery in Sanford. The Floyd in Pink Floyd Syd Barrett, of the English psychedelic rock band Pink Floyd, created the band's name by juxtaposing the first names of Council and South Carolina bluesman Pink Anderson, having noticed the names in the liner notes of a 1962 album by Blind Boy Fuller (Philips BBL-7512), written by the blues historian Paul Oliver: \\"Curley Weaver and Fred McMullen, ... Pink Anderson or Floyd Council‚Äîthese were a few amongst the many blues singers that were to be heard in the rolling hills of the Piedmont, or meandering with the streams through the wooded valleys.\\" Discography No records are available which exclusively feature Council's work. The CD Carolina Blues features six songs he recorded: \\"I'm Grievin' and I'm Worryin'\\", \\"I Don't Want No Hungry Woman\\", \\"Lookin' for My Baby\\", \\"Poor and Ain't Got a Dime\\", \\"Runaway Man Blues\\" and \\"Working Man Blues\\". In a 1969 interview, Council stated he had recorded 27 songs over his career, seven of them backing Blind Boy Fuller. Fuller's Complete Recorded Works contains many songs with Council playing guitar.

Traditionally, mindfulness is thought to be applied to four domains, \\"constantly watching sensory experience in order to prevent the arising of cravings which would power future experience into rebirths,\\" namely mindfulness of the body, feelings/sensations, mind/consciousness, and dhammƒÅs. The modern Theravadan Buddhism and the Vipassana or Insight Meditation Movement promote satipatthana as key techniques for achieving mindfulness, promoting \\"mindfulness\\" as meaning careful attention instead of the recollection of the dhamma. Etymology is a compound term that has been parsed (and thus translated) in two ways, namely ' and '. The separate terms can be translated as follows: * Sati - Pali; Sanskrit sm·πõti. Sm·πõti originally meant \\"to remember,\\" \\"to recollect,\\" \\"to bear in mind,\\" as in the Vedic tradition of remembering the sacred texts. The term sati also means \\"to remember.\\" In the Satipa»õ»õhƒÅna-sutta the term sati means to remember the wholesome dhammƒÅs, whereby the true nature of phenomena can be seen, such as the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening-factors, the Noble Eightfold Path, and the attainment of insight. * ' (Sanskrit: upasthƒÅna) - \\"attendance, waiting on, looking after, service, care, ministering\\"The Pali Text Society's Pali-English Dictionary, Upa·π≠·π≠hƒÅna * ' - \\"setting forth, putting forward;\\" in later Buddhist literature also \\"origin,\\" \\"starting point,\\" \\"cause.\\"The Pali Text Society's Pali-English Dictionary, Pa·π≠·π≠hƒÅna The compound terms have been translated as follows: *' - \\"presence of mindfulness\\" or \\"establishment of mindfulness\\" or \\"arousing of mindfulness,\\" underscoring the mental qualities co-existent with or antecedent to mindfulness. *' - \\"foundation of mindfulness,\\" underscoring the object used to gain mindfulness. While the latter parsing and translation is more traditional, the former has been given etymological and contextual authority by contemporary Buddhist scholars such as Bhikkhu Analayo and Bhikkhu Bodhi. AnƒÅlayo argues from an etymological standpoint that, while \\"foundation ['] of mindfulness\\" is supported by the PƒÅli commentary, the term ' (foundation) was otherwise unused in the PƒÅli nikayas and is only first used in the Abhidhamma. In contrast, the term ' (presence or establishment) can in fact be found throughout the nikayas and is readily visible in the Sanskrit equivalents of the compound PƒÅli phrase ' (Skt., ' or '). Thus AnƒÅlayo states that \\"presence of mindfulness\\" (as opposed to \\"foundation of mindfulness\\") is more likely to be etymologically correct.AnƒÅlayo (2006), pp. 29-30 Like AnƒÅlayo, Bodhi assesses that \\"establishment [] of mindfulness\\" is the preferred translation. However, Bodhi's analysis is more contextual than AnƒÅlayo's. According to Bodhi, while \\"establishment of mindfulness\\" is normally supported by the textual context, there are exceptions to this rule, such as with SN 47.42 where a translation of \\"foundation of mindfulness\\" is best supported.Bodhi (2000), p. 1504 Soma uses both \\"foundations of mindfulness\\" and \\"arousing of mindfulness.\\"Soma (1941/2003) Four domains or aspects Traditionally, mindfulness is thought to be applied to four domains, \\"constantly watching sensory experience in order to prevent the arising of cravings which would power future experience into rebirths.\\" The four domains are: * mindfulness of the body (kaya);(PƒÅli: kƒÅya-sati, kƒÅyagatƒÅ-sati; Skt. kƒÅya-sm·πõti)Salient sections of the PƒÅli canon on kƒÅya-sati (kƒÅya-gatƒÅ-sati): http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/g_m/kaaya_gata_sati.htm * mindfulness of feelings or sensations (vedanƒÅ);(PƒÅli vedanƒÅ-sati; Skt. vedanƒÅ-sm·πõti) * mindfulness of mind or consciousness (citta);(PƒÅli citta-sati; Skt. citta- sm·πõti) and * mindfulness of dhammƒÅs.(PƒÅli dhammƒÅ-sati; Skt. dharma-sm·πõti) =Mindfulness of dhammas= \\"DhammƒÅ\\" is often translated as \\"mental objects\\". According to AnƒÅlayoAnƒÅlayo 2006, pp. 182-86 translating dhamma as \\"mental object\\" is problematic for multiple reasons. The three prior satipatthƒÅna (body, sensations, mind) can become mental objects in themselves, and those objects, such as the hindrances, aggregates and sense bases, identified under the term dhamma are far from an exhaustive list of all possible mental objects. AnƒÅlayo translates dhammƒÅ as \\"mental factors and categories,\\" \\"classificatory schemes,\\" and \\"frameworks or points of reference to be applied during contemplation\\".AnƒÅlayo 2006 p. 183 AnƒÅlayoAnƒÅlayo 2006 p. 183, nn. 2, 3 quotes GyoriGyori 1996, p. 24 as stating that contemplation of these dhammƒÅ \\"are specifically intended to invest the mind with a soteriological orientation.\\" He further quotes GombrichGombrich 1996, p. 36 as writing that contemplating these dhammƒÅ teaches one \\"to see the world through Buddhist spectacles.\\" Within Buddhist teachings In the Satipatthana Sutta the term sati means to remember the dharmas, whereby the true nature of phenomena can be seen. According to Paul Williams, referring to Erich Frauwallner, mindfulness provided the way to liberation, \\"constantly watching sensory experience in order to prevent the arising of cravings which would power future experience into rebirths.\\" According to Vetter, dhyƒÅna may have been the original core practice of the Buddha, which aided the maintenance of mindfulness. The four foundations of mindfulness are one of the seven sets of \\"states conducive to enlightenment\\" (PƒÅli bodhipakkhiyƒÅdhammƒÅ) identified in many schools of Buddhism as means for progressing toward bodhi (awakening). In the Noble Eightfold Path, they are included in sammƒÅ-sati and, less directly, sammƒÅ-samƒÅdhi. Sati is recommended as a \\"one-way path\\" for the purification from unwholesome factors, and the realization of Nibbana. In the PƒÅli Canon, this framework for systematically cultivating mindful awareness can be found in the Mahasatipatthana Sutta (\\"Greater Discourse on the Foundation of Mindfulness,\\" DN 22); the ' (\\"Discourse on the Foundations of Mindfulness,\\" MN 10), and throughout the ' (SN, Chapter 47). The ' itself contains 104 of the Buddha's discourses on the 'Samyutta Nikaya, Ch. 47. See Bodhi (2000), pp. 1627ff. including two popular discourses delivered to the townspeople of Sedaka, \\"the Acrobat\\"The Acrobat, Thanissaro, 1997a and \\"the Beauty Queen\\".The Beauty Queen, Thanissaro, 1997b The Sutta Pitaka contains texts in which The Buddha is said to refer to the fourfold establishment of mindfulness as a \\"direct\\" or \\"one-way path\\" for purification and the realisation of nirvana. The Chinese Tripitaka also contains two parallels to the Satipatthana sutta; Madhyama ƒÄgama No. 26 and Ekottara Agama 12.1. The four foundations of mindfulness are also treated in scholastic and Abhidharma works. In the Theravada tradition, they are found in the Visuddhimagga, the Abhidhammattha- sa·πÖgaha and the works of Mahasi Sayadaw. The Buddhist texts used in the Mahayana Buddhist tradition also contain teachings on the four sm·πõtyupasthƒÅnƒÅni. These include the YogƒÅcƒÅrabh≈´mi, the Abhidharmako≈õa, the long Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ sutra and the BodhisattvacaryƒÅvatƒÅra. Contemporary exegesis The four establishments of mindfulness are regarded as fundamental in modern Theravadan Buddhism and the Vipassana or Insight Meditation Movement. In this approach the emphasis is on mindfulness itself, as bare attention, instead of on the objects, mental states to be guarded, and the teachings to be remembered. The four establishments () meditation practices gradually develop the mental factors of samatha (\\"calm\\") and vipassana (\\"insight\\"). Thanissaro Bhikkhu notes that \\"satipatthana practice is often said to be separate from the practice of jhana,\\" but argues that mindfulness is also an aid in the development of concentration.\\" Maha-satipatthana Sutta: The Great Frames of Reference\\" (DN 22), translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu. Access to Insight (Legacy Edition), 30 November 2013, http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.22.0.than.html . According to Buddhadasa, the aim of mindfulness is to stop the arising of disturbing thoughts and emotions, which arise from sense-contact. According to Grzegorz Polak, the four upassanƒÅ have been misunderstood by the developing Buddhist tradition, including Theravada, to refer to four different foundations. According to Polak, the four upassanƒÅ do not refer to four different foundations of which one should be aware, but are an alternate description of the jhanas, describing how the samskharas are tranquilized: * the six sense- bases which one needs to be aware of (kƒÅyƒÅnupassanƒÅ); * contemplation on vedanƒÅs, which arise with the contact between the senses and their objects (vedanƒÅnupassanƒÅ); * the altered states of mind to which this practice leads (cittƒÅnupassanƒÅ); * the development from the five hindrances to the seven factors of enlightenment (dhammƒÅnupassanƒÅ).  In Indo-Tibetan Buddhism  The four establishments of mindfulness also known as \\"the four close placements of mindfulness\\" (dran-pa nyer-bzhag) are also taught in Indo Tibetan Buddhism as they are part of the 37 factors leading to a purified state (byang-chub yan- lag so-bdun). They are discussed in Tibetan commentaries on ≈öƒÅntideva‚Äôs BodhicaryƒÅvatƒÅra, such as Pawo Tsugla Trengwa Rinpoche‚Äôs 16th century commentary and Kunzang Pelden‚Äôs (1862-1943) commentary The Nectar of Manjushri‚Äôs Speech.Weiser, Thomas A.

Naropa University. The Tibetan canon also contains a True Dharma Application of Mindfulness Sutra (Tohoku Catalogue # 287, dam chos dran pa nyer bzhag, saddharmasm·πõtyupasthƒÅnasutra). This sutra is cited by various Tibetan Buddhist figures, such as Atisha (in his Open Basket of Jewels) and the Third Dzogchen Rinpoche (1759‚Äì1792).Apple, James B (2019).

Introduction to Buddhist Tantric Systems: Translated from Mkhas Grub Rje's Rgyud Sde Spyihi Rnam Par Gzag Pargyas Par Brjod with Original Text and Annotation. p. 45. This sutra is a large text that dates from the second and fourth centuries CE and survives in Tibetan, Chinese and Sanskrit manuscripts.Stuart, Daniel Malinowski (2012) A Less Traveled Path: Meditation and Textual Practice in the Saddharmasmrtyupasthana(sutra) pp. 25-27.

The earliest layer of the text, which can be found in chapter two, contains the core meditation teachings of the text, which include an extensive exposition of six elements (dhatus) meditation, meditations on feeling (vedana), meditations on the skandhas and ayatanas, meditation on the mind and impermanence, and other meditation topics organized into a structure of ten levels (bhumi).Stuart, Daniel Malinowski (2012) A Less Traveled Path: Meditation and Textual Practice in the Saddharmasmrtyupasthana(sutra) pp. 46, 70-75. According to Jigme Lingpa's (1730‚Äì1798) Treasury of Precious Qualities, the four applications of mindfulness are emphasized during the path of accumulation and in Mahayana are practiced with a focus on emptiness: > \\"If one practices according to the Hinayana, one meditates on the impurity > of the body, on the feelings of sufferings, on the impermanence of > consciousness and on the fact that mental objects are \\"ownerless\\" (there is > no self to which they belong). If one practices according to the Mahayana, > during the meditation session one meditates on the same things as being > spacelike, beyond all conceptual constructs. In the post-meditation period > one considers them as illusory and dreamlike.\\"Longchen Yeshe Dorje, Jigme > Lingpa (2010). Treasury of Precious Qualities: Book One, p. 391. Shambhala > Publications. The four applications of mindfulness are also discussed by Nyingma scholars like as Rong-zom-pa (eleventh century), Longchenpa (1308‚Äì1364), and Ju Mipham (1846‚Äì1912).Dorji Wangchuk, ‚ÄúThe Diachronic and Synchronic Relationship between Philosophical Theory and Spiritual Praxis in Buddhism: With Special Reference to the Case of the Four Applications of Mindfulness (sm·πõtyupasthƒÅna: dran pa nye bar gzhag pa) in VajrayƒÅna.‚Äù In Buddhist Meditative Praxis: Traditional Teachings and Modern Applications, edited by K.L. Dhammajoti. Hong Kong: Centre of Buddhist Studies, University of Hong Kong, 2015, pp. 177‚Äì201. These authors describe specifically Vajrayana modes of the four sm·πõtyupasthƒÅnas, which have been adapted to the Vajrayana philosophy. These four \\"mantric\\" sm·πõtyupasthƒÅnas described by Mipham as summarized by Dorji Wangchuk as follows: > (1) Contemplating (blo bzhag pa) the physical bodies of oneself and others > as being characterized by primordial or intrinsic purity (dag pa), on the > one hand, and by emptiness (stong pa nyid), freedom from manifoldness (spros > bral), great homogeneity (mnyam pa chen po), and integrality (zung du ‚Äôjug > pa), on the other, is called kƒÅyasm·πõtyupasthƒÅna. (2) Transforming > ‚Äúconceptual constructions whose occurrence one feels/senses (or is aware > of)‚Äù (byung tshor gyi rtog pa) into gnosis characterized by great bliss (bde > ba chen po‚Äôi ye shes) is called vedanƒÅsm·πõtyupasthƒÅna. (3) Channelling or > containing/constraining (sdom pa) all kinds of manifoldness associated with > mind and mental factors into/in/to the innate sphere of the luminous nature > of the mind is called cittasm·πõtyupasthƒÅna. (4) Conducting oneself in a way > (or with an attitude) that all sa·πÉsƒÅric and nirvƒÅ·πáic, universal and > particular phenomena are pure and equal and hence beyond adoption or > rejection, is dharmasm·πõtyupasthƒÅna. Examples of contemporary figures in Indo-Tibetan Buddhism that have taught this practice include Chogyam Trungpa who often taught these practices in the USA and Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche, a contemporary Tibetan lama.See for example, Ch√∂gyam Trungpa (1991) The Heart of the Buddha: Entering the Tibetan Buddhist Path.

They have also been taught by the 14th Dalai Lama and students of his like Alexander Berzin and Thubten Chodron. The general presentation of this practice in the Indo-Tibetan Buddhist tradition focuses on cultivating ≈õamatha first, and then practicing vipa≈õyanƒÅ.

Common attributes  In comparison with the upper house, lower houses frequently display certain characteristics (though they vary per jurisdiction). ;Powers: * In a parliamentary system, the lower house: **In the modern era, has much more power, usually based on restrictions against the upper house. **Is able to override the upper house in some ways. **Can vote a motion of no confidence against the government, as well as vote for or against any proposed candidate for head of government at the beginning of the parliamentary term. **Exceptions are Australia, where the Senate has considerable power approximate to that of the House of Representatives, and Italy, where the Senate has exactly the same powers as the Chamber of Deputies. * In a presidential system, the lower house: ** Debatably somewhat less, the lower house also has exclusive powers in some areas. ** Has the sole power to impeach the executive (the upper house then tries the impeachment). ** Typically initiates appropriation/supply-related legislation. ;Status of lower house: * Always elected directly, while the upper house may be elected directly, indirectly, or not elected at all. * Its members may be elected with a different voting system to the upper house. * Most populated administrative divisions are better represented than in the upper house; representation is usually proportional to population. * Elected more frequently. * Elected all at once, not by staggered terms. * In a parliamentary system, can be dissolved by the executive. * More members. * Has total or initial control over budget, supply, and monetary laws. * Lower age of candidacy than the upper house. The government of the day is usually required to present its budget to the lower house, which must approve the budget. It is a widespread practice for revenue (i.e., appropriation) bills to originate in the lower house.

It is a term used in law in a variety of senses. Sometimes it is employed roughly and has no technical meaning; this indicates the distribution of a benefit (e.g. salvage or damages under the Fatal Accidents Act 1846, ¬ß 2), or liability (e.g. general average contributions, or tithe rent-charge), or the incidence of a duty (e.g. obligations as to the maintenance of highways). In its strict legal interpretation apportionment falls into two classes: \\"apportionment in respect of estate\\" and \\"apportionment in respect of time.\\" Apportionment in respect of estate Apportionment in respect of estate may result either from the act of the parties or from the operation of law. =Apportionment by act of the parties= Where a lessee is evicted from, or surrenders or forfeits possession of part of the property leased to him, he becomes liable at common law to pay only a rent apportioned to the value of the interest which he still retains. So where the person entitled to the reversion of an estate assigns part of it, the right to an apportioned part of the rent incident to the England,Law of Property Amendment Act 1859, ¬ß 3; Conveyancing Act 1881, ¬ß 12. and in many of the British colonies.For example, Ontario, Rev. Stats., 1897, c. 170, ¬ß 9; Barbados, No. 12 of 1891, ¬ß 9. In the cases just mentioned there is apportionment in respect of estate by act of the parties. = Apportionment by operation of law = Apportionment by operation of law may be brought about where by act of law a lease becomes inoperative as regards its subject-matter, or by the \\"act of God\\", as, for instance, where part of an estate is submerged by the encroachments of the sea. To the same category belongs the apportionment of rent which takes place under various statutes (e.g. the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act 1845, ¬ß 119, when land is required for public purposes; the Agricultural Holdings Act 1883, ¬ß 41, in the case of a tenant from year to year receiving notice to quit part of a holding; and the Irish Land Act 1903 ¬ß 61, apportionment of quit and crown rents).  Apportionment in respect of time  At common law, there was no apportionment of rent in respect of time. Such apportionment was, however, in certain cases allowed in England by the Distress for Rent Act 1737, and the Apportionment Act 1834, and is now allowed generally. Under that statute (¬ß2) all rents, annuities, dividends and other periodical payments in the nature of income are to be considered as accruing from day to day and to be apportionable in respect of time accordingly. It is provided, however, that the apportioned part of such rents, etc., shall only be payable or recoverable in the case of a continuing payment, when the entire portion of which it forms part itself becomes payable, and, in the case of a payment determined by re-entry, death or otherwise, only when the next entire portion would have been payable if it had not so determined (¬ß 3). Persons entitled to apportioned parts of rent have the same remedies for recovering them when payable as they would have had in respect of the entire rent; but a lessee is not to be liable for any apportioned part specifically. The rent is recoverable by the heir or other person who would, but for the apportionment, be entitled to the entire rent, and he holds it subject to distribution (¬ß 4). The Apportionment Act 1870 extends to payments not made under any instrument in writing (¬ß2), but not to annual sums made payable in policies of insurance (¬ß 6). Apportionment under the act can be excluded by express stipulation. The apportionment created by this statute is \\"apportionment in respect of time.\\" The cases to which it applies are mainly cases of either: # apportionment of rent due under leases where at a time between the dates fixed for payment the lessor or lessee dies, or some other alteration in the position of parties occurs; or # apportionment of income between the representatives of a limited owner and the remainder-man when the limited interest determines at a time between the date when such income became due. = Apportionment of rent = With regard to the former of these classes, it may be noticed that although apportioned rent becomes payable only when the whole rent is due, the landlord, in the case of the bankruptcy of an ordinary tenant, may prove for a proportionate part of the rent up to the date of the receiving order;Bankruptcy Act 1883, Sched. ii. r. 19. and that a similar rule holds good in the winding up of a company;In South Kensington Co-operative Stores, 1881, 17 Ch.D. 161. and further that the act of 1870 applies to the liability to pay, as well as to the right to receive, rent.Wilson, 1893, 62 L.J.Q.B. 628, 632. Accordingly, where an assignment of a lease is made between two half-yearly rent-days, the assignee is not liable to pay the full amount of the half-year's rent falling due on the rent-day next after the date of the assignment, but only an apportioned part of that half- year's rent, computed from the last mentioned date.Glass v. Patterson, 1902, 2 Ir.R. 660. If someone pays a ground rent on a leasehold property or a rentcharge on a freehold property that is also payable on other neighbouring properties, they can apply to the Department for Communities and Local Government for an 'order of apportionment' that legally separates their share of the ground rent or rentcharge. = Apportionment of income = With regard to the apportionment of income, the only points requiring notice here are that all dividends payable by public companies are apportionable, whether paid at fixed periods or not, unless the payment is, in effect, a payment of capital (¬ß 5).

Kent Hewitt USN (1887-1972), was a built by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Division of Litton Industries at Pascagoula, Mississippi and launched on 14 September 1974 by Mrs. Leroy Hewitt Taylor and Mrs. Gerald Hewitt Norton, daughters of Admiral Hewitt. History Hewitt was the fourth of the Spruance-class destroyers. Known as the \\"Greyhounds of the fleet\\" for their speed, versatility and reliability, they were the largest general purpose destroyers ever to fly the flag of the United States. Hewitt, 1986. Hewitt was commissioned on 25 September 1976. After an intensive period of initial training, Hewitt deployed to the Western Pacific in September 1978 and was assigned to the U.S. 7th Fleet. In addition to serving as a front line unit, Hewitt also acted as a good will ambassador with port visits to Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Hong Kong. Hewitt returned to San Diego in April 1979. In preparation for her next deployment, Hewitt participated in a multinational Rim-of-the-Pacific (RIMPAC) battle group exercise in February and March 1980. She departed on her second overseas deployment on 15 May 1980. During that deployment, Hewitt and other members of Battle Group Charlie operated in the Indian Ocean to show U.S. resolve to protect free world access to Middle East petroleum resources, and to help obtain the release of 52 Americans held hostage in Iran. Hewitt earned the Navy Expeditionary Medal for her contributions. During the latter part of the deployment, Hewitt also earned the Humanitarian Service Medal for rescuing a group of Vietnamese boat refugees adrift in the South China Sea. For her superior performance, Hewitt was awarded the Battle \\"E\\" as the most outstanding ship in Destroyer Squadron 21 (DesRon 21) from 1979 to 1980. Hewitt entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard on 19 May 1981 for its first regular overhaul. Extensive modifications were performed to improve survivability, and new combat systems capabilities were added to improve quick reaction to missile attacks. After a rigorous re-qualification and retraining period, Hewitt departed on 21 March 1983 for its third deployment. Highlights included a three aircraft carrier fleet exercise with , and , and independent operations in the South China Sea. Hewitt c.1986. Hewitt departed on her fourth deployment on 18 October 1984. Once again a member of Battle Group Charlie, she spent seven highly successful months in the Western Pacific and Indian Oceans. In January 1985, Hewitt set a record at the Tabones Firing Range in the Philippines by earning the highest score ever recorded at the range for Naval Gunfire Support (NGFS) exercise. From February to April 1985, Hewitt operated in the North Arabian Sea and Gulf of Oman. For its achievements during the deployment, Hewitt received the Meritorious Unit Commendation. Hewitt returned home to San Diego on 24 May 1985. On 1 September 1985, Hewitt and other members of Destroyer Squadron 31 became the first Pacific Fleet Anti-Submarine Warfare Squadron. The squadron's basic mission was to locate and track submarines in the Eastern Pacific, to develop USW tactics and training, and to serve as a ready response force under Commander, U.S. 3rd Fleet. From September 1985 to April 1987, Hewitt and the other ships in DesRon 31 set new standards of excellence in USW. During Hewitt's second overhaul (May 1987 to November 1988) at National Steel and Shipbuilding Company Shipyard in San Diego, California, she underwent a modernization which included installation of the Vertical Launch System, the Tomahawk Missile System, the Close-In Weapons System (CIWS), LAMPS MK III, and the SQQ-89 Sonar System. After a brief but extensive training and inspection cycle, Hewitt joined DesRon 21 and once again deployed to the Persian Gulf on 18 September 1989. Hewitt's fifth Western Pacific deployment ended on 16 March 1990. Five months later, Hewitt was underway to her new homeport at Yokosuka, Japan. Hewitt during FLEETEX '89. Hewitt joined Destroyer Squadron 15 on 25 August 1990. In Yokosuka, she operated with numerous multi-national forces, including the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force, and the South Korean, Bruneian, Greek, French, Spanish, Australian, Saudi Arabian, Russian, British, and Singaporean navies. Hewitt participated as flagship for Maritime Interception Force (MIF) Commander Red Sea for Boarding Operations in support of Operation Desert Storm in 1991 as part of United Nations sanctions against Iraq. Hewitt concluded an intensive six-month deployment to the Persian Gulf in April 1993. Her seventh deployment was highlighted by a Tomahawk strike against Iraq and combined operations with numerous navies, the Russian destroyer . Hewitt also served as Maritime Action Group (MAG) Commander in October 1993, helping to develop the new MAG warfare concept. Hewitt was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation for the 1992-1993 Persian Gulf deployment and the U.S. 7th Fleet's USW Excellence Award for 1993. Following a brief maintenance availability in early 1994. Hewitt participated in RIMPAC '94. Directly following the exercise, Hewitt conducted live missile firings near Barking Sands, Kauai, Hawaii which included a successful NATO Sea Sparrow engagement and the first fleet firing of the Penguin anti-ship missile with HSL 51 Detachment 6 on 25 June 1994. Hewitt again deployed to the Persian Gulf on 5 September 1994 as a primary component of the multinational Middle East peacekeeping unit, enforcing United Nations sanctions against Iraq. Hewitt returned to Yokosuka, Japan 10 January 1995 and received U.S. 7th Fleet's Surface Warfare Award for 1994. On 17 March 1995, Hewitt entered the yards for an extended availability period which ended 5 September 1995. Afterwards, Hewitt participated in several multinational USW exercises and was awarded the Battle \\"E\\" for her performance in 1995. On 3 June 1996, Hewitt deployed to the Persian Gulf for Middle East Force deployment (MEF) 96-2. While supporting U.S. 5th Fleet operations, Hewitt participated in Operation Desert Strike and launched two Tomahawk missiles on 4 September 1996 against Iraq. Hewitt received a Meritorious Unit Commendation for her actions during the deployment and returned home to Yokosuka, Japan on 30 October 1996. USS Hewitt firing a NATO Sea Sparrow missile, 2000. Hewitt waits in the background while a boarding team member stands on the bridge of the merchant ship Ibn Abdoon. In March 1997, Hewitt conducted battle group exercises with and in April Destroyer Squadron 15 for the Sharem 120B exercise in the Yellow Sea conducted with the Republic of Korea Navy. In May Hewitt entered an availability and received the women at-sea modification to berth the first females permanently assigned to the ship. The first female Sailors reported on board in July. On 24 August 1997, Hewitt departed Yokosuka, Japan for a homeport change to NS San Diego, California. Hewitt joined Destroyer Squadron 23 on 29 August 1997 during her transit to San Diego. On 27 January 1999, Hewitt deployed to the Persian Gulf for Middle East Force Deployment (MEF) 99-1. In support of U.N. Sanctions against Iraq. Hewitt conducted visit, board, search and seizure of merchants in the area. Hewitt returned to San Diego on 26 July 1999 followed by a two-month Selected Restricted Availability which ended 7 November 1999. =Awards= * Joint Meritorious Unit Award - (13 Jan 1993) * Navy Unit Commendation - (Aug 1990-Nov 1991, Nov 1992-Apr 1993, Jul 1994-Apr 1996, Jul- Sep 1996) * Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation - (Nov 1984-May 1985, Sep 1985-Dec 1986, Aug-Dec 1994, Dec 2000-Mar 2001) * Battle \\"E\\" - (1979, 1987, 1995) * Navy Expeditionary Medal - (Jun-Aug 1980) * Southwest Asia Service Medal - (Jun-Sep 1991) * Humanitarian Service Medal - (3 Sep 1980) Fate Hewitt was decommissioned 19 July 2001; she was sold for scrap to International Shipbreaking, Incorporated, of Brownsville, Texas on 9 August 2001.

Red mercury is purportedly a substance of uncertain composition used in the creation of nuclear weapons, as well as a variety of unrelated weapons systems. Because of the great secrecy surrounding the development and manufacture of nuclear weapons, there is no proof that red mercury exists. However, all samples of alleged \\"red mercury\\" analyzed in the public literature have proven to be well-known, common red substances of no interest to weapons makers. Red mercury is therefore considered a hoax, perpetrated by con artists who sought to take advantage of gullible buyers on the black market for arms. There have been reports of \\"red mercury\\" on the international black markets since 1979, but the hoax seems to have been most common in the early 1990s, with very high asking prices.  History  References to red mercury first appeared in major Soviet and western media sources in the late 1980s. The articles were never specific as to what exactly red mercury was, but nevertheless claimed it was of great importance in nuclear bombs, or that it was used in the building of boosted fission weapons. Almost as soon as the stories appeared, people started attempting to buy it. At that point the exact nature of the substance started to change, and eventually turned into anything the buyer happened to be interested in. As New Scientist reported in 1992, a Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory report outlined that: > When red mercury first appeared on the international black market 15 years > ago, the supposedly top secret nuclear material was 'red' because it came > from Russia. When it resurfaced last year in the formerly communist states > of Eastern Europe it had unaccountably acquired a red colour. But then, as a > report from the US Department of Energy reveals, mysterious transformations > are red mercury's stock in trade. The report, compiled by researchers at the > Los Alamos National Laboratory, shows that in the hands of hoaxers and > conmen, red mercury can do almost anything the aspiring Third World > demagogue wants it to. You want a short cut to making an atom bomb? You want > the key to Soviet ballistic missile guidance systems? Or perhaps you want > the Russian alternative to the anti-radar paint on the stealth bomber? What > you need is red mercury. An article in the daily Russian newspaper states that Pravda in 1993, claiming to be based on leaked top secret memos, described red mercury as: > [A] super-conductive material used for producing high-precision conventional > and nuclear bomb explosives, 'Stealth' surfaces and self-guided warheads. > Primary end-users are major aerospace and nuclear-industry companies in the > United States and France along with nations aspiring to join the nuclear > club, such as South Africa, Israel, Iran, Iraq, and Libya. Two TV documentaries about red mercury were made by British Channel 4 television, airing in 1993 and 1994, Trail of Red Mercury and Pocket Neutron, which claimed to have \\"startling evidence that Russian scientists have designed a miniature neutron bomb using a mysterious compound called red mercury\\". Samuel T. Cohen, an American physicist who worked on building the atomic bomb, said in his autobiography that red mercury is manufactured by \\"mixing special nuclear materials in very small amounts into the ordinary compound and then inserting the mixture into a nuclear reactor or bombarding it with a particle-accelerator beam.\\" When detonated, this mixture allegedly becomes \\"extremely hot, which allows pressures and temperatures to be built up that are capable of igniting the heavy hydrogen and producing a pure-fusion mini neutron bomb.\\" Red mercury was offered for sale throughout Europe and the Middle East by Russian businessmen, who found many buyers who would pay almost anything for the substance even though they had no idea what it was. A study for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists in 1997 has perhaps the best summary of the topic: > The asking price for red mercury ranged from $100,000 to $300,000 per > kilogram. Sometimes the material would be irradiated or shipped in > containers with radioactive symbols, perhaps to convince potential buyers of > its strategic value. But samples seized by police contained only mercury(II) > oxide, mercury(II) iodide, or mercury mixed with red dye ‚Äì hardly materials > of interest to weapons-makers. Following the arrest of several men in Britain in September 2004, on suspicion that they were trying to buy a kilogram of red mercury for ¬£900,000, the International Atomic Energy Agency made a statement dismissing claims that the substance is real. \\"Red mercury doesn't exist,\\" said the spokesman. \\"The whole thing is a bunch of malarkey.\\" When the case came to trial at the Old Bailey in April 2006, it became apparent that News of the Worlds \\"fake sheikh\\" Mazher Mahmood had worked with the police to catch the three men, Dominic Martins, Roque Fernandes and Abdurahman Kanyare. They were tried for \\"trying to set up funding or property for terrorism\\" and \\"having an article (a highly dangerous mercury-based substance) for terrorism\\". According to the prosecutor, red mercury was believed to be a material which could cause a large explosion, possibly even a nuclear reaction, but whether or not red mercury actually existed was irrelevant to the prosecution. All three men were acquitted in July 2006.  Analysis  Several common mercury compounds are indeed red, such as mercury sulfide (from which the bright-red pigment vermilion was originally derived), mercury(II) oxide, and mercury(II) iodide, and others are explosive, such as mercury(II) fulminate. No use for any of these compounds in nuclear weapons has been publicly documented. \\"Red mercury\\" could also be a code name for a substance that contains no mercury at all, perhaps another name for the mysterious, but acknowledged, FOGBANK compound. A variety of different items have been chemically analyzed as putative samples of \\"red mercury\\" since the substance first came to the attention of the media, but no single substance was found in these items. A sample of radioactive material was seized by German police in May 1994. This consisted of a complex mixture of elements, including about 10% by weight plutonium, with the remainder consisting of 61% mercury, 11% antimony, 6% oxygen, 2% iodine and 1.6% gallium. The reason why somebody had assembled this complex mixture of chemicals is unknown; equally puzzling was the presence of fragments of glass and brush bristles, suggesting that someone had dropped a bottle of this substance and then swept it up into a new container. In contrast, an analysis reported in 1998 of a different \\"red mercury\\" sample concluded that this sample was a non-radioactive mixture of elemental mercury, water and mercury(II) iodide, which is a red colored chemical. Similarly, another analysis of a sample recovered in Zagreb in November 2003 reported that this item contained only mercury. One formula that had been claimed previously for red mercury was Hg2Sb2O7 (mercury(II) pyroantimonate), but no antimony was detected in this 2003 sample.  Explanations  Red mercury was described by many commentators, and the exact nature of its supposed working mechanism varied widely among them. In general, however, none of these explanations appear to be scientifically or historically supportable. =Background= Traditional staged thermonuclear weapons consist of two parts, a fission \\"primary\\" and a fusion/fission \\"secondary\\". The energy released by the primary when it explodes is used to (indirectly) compress the secondary and start a fusion reaction within it. Conventional explosives are far too weak to provide the level of compression needed. The primary is generally built as small as possible, due to the fact that the energy released by the secondary is much larger, and thus building a larger primary is generally inefficient. There is a lower limit on the size of the primary that can be built, known as the critical mass. For weapons grade plutonium, this is around 10 kg. This can be reduced through the use of neutron reflectors or clever arrangements of explosives to compress the core, but these methods generally add to the size and complexity of the resulting device. Due to the need for a fission primary, and the difficulty of purifying weapons-grade fissile materials, the majority of arms control efforts to limit nuclear proliferation rely on the detection and control of the fissile material and the equipment needed to obtain it. =Shortcut to fissionable material= A theory popular in the mid-1990s was that red mercury facilitated the enrichment of uranium to weapons-grade purity. Conventionally, such enrichment is usually done with Zippe-type centrifuges, and takes several years. Red mercury was speculated to eliminate this costly and time-consuming step. Although this would not eliminate the possibility of detecting the material, it could escape detection during enrichment as the facilities hosting centrifuges normally used in this process are very large and require equipment that can be fairly easily tracked internationally. Eliminating such equipment would in theory greatly ease the construction of a clandestine nuclear weapon. =Shortcut to fusible material= A key part of the secondary in a fusion bomb is lithium-6-deuteride. When irradiated with high-energy neutrons, Li-6 creates tritium, which mixes with the deuterium in the same mixture and fuses at a relatively low temperature. Russian weapon designers have reported (1993) that red mercury was the Soviet codename for lithium-6, which has an affinity for mercury and tends to acquire a red colour due to mercuric impurities during its separation process.M. Ragheb Isotopic Separation and Enrichment Nuclear Power Engineering, 2010 =Red mercury as a ballotechnic= Samuel T. Cohen, the \\"father of the neutron bomb\\", claimed for a long time that red mercury is a powerful explosive-like chemical known as a ballotechnic. The energy released during its reaction is allegedly enough to directly compress the secondary without the need for a fission primary in a thermonuclear weapon. He claimed that he learned that the Soviet scientists perfected the use of red mercury and used it to produce a number of softball-sized pure fusion bombs weighing as little as , which he claimed were made in large numbers. He went on to claim that the reason this is not more widely known is that elements within the US power structure are deliberately keeping it \\"under wraps\\" due to the frightening implications such a weapon would have on nuclear proliferation. Since a red mercury bomb would require no fissile material, it would seemingly be impossible to protect against its widespread proliferation given current arms control methodologies. Instead of trying to do so, they simply claim it does not exist, while acknowledging its existence privately. Cohen also claimed that when President Boris Yeltsin took power, he secretly authorized the sale of red mercury on the international market, and that fake versions of it were sometimes offered to gullible buyers. Cohen's claims appear to be difficult to support scientifically. The amount of energy released by the fission primary is thousands of times greater than that released by conventional explosives, and it appears that the \\"red mercury\\" approach would be orders of magnitude smaller than required. Furthermore, ballotechnic materials are those that do not explode, so it is difficult to understand how their energy could be used to produce compression at all. Additionally, it appears there is no independent confirmation of any sort of Cohen's claims to the reality of red mercury. The scientists in charge of the labs where the material would have been made have publicly dismissed the claims (see below), as have numerous US colleagues, including Edward Teller. According to Cohen, veteran nuclear weapon designer Dr. Frank Barnaby conducted secret interviews with Russian scientists who told him that red mercury was produced by dissolving mercury antimony oxide in mercury, heating and irradiating the resultant amalgam, and then removing the elemental mercury through evaporation. The irradiation was reportedly carried out by placing the substance inside a nuclear reactor. =Stealth paint= As mentioned earlier, one of the origins of the term \\"red mercury\\" was in the Russian newspaper Pravda, which claimed that red mercury was \\"a super-conductive material used for producing high-precision conventional and nuclear bomb explosives, 'stealth' surfaces and self-guided warheads.\\" Any substance with these sorts of highly differing properties would be suspect to most, but the stealth story continued to have some traction long after most had dismissed the entire story. =Nuclear \\"sting\\" operations= Red mercury is thought by some to be the invention of an intelligence agency or criminal gang for the purpose of deceiving terrorists and rogue states who were trying to acquire nuclear technology on the black market. One televised report indicated that the Soviet Union encouraged the KGB and GRU to arrange sting operations for the detection of those seeking to deal in nuclear materials. The Soviet intelligence services allegedly created a myth of the necessity of \\"red mercury\\" for the sorts of nuclear devices that terrorists and rogue governments might seek. Political entities that already had nuclear weapons did nothing to debunk the myth. In 1999 Jane's Intelligence Review suggested that victims of red mercury scams may have included Osama bin Laden. = Red mercury in southern Africa = Organizations involved in landmine clearance and unexploded munitions disposal noted a belief amongst some communities in southern Africa that red mercury may be found in certain types of ordnance. Attempting to extract red mercury, purported to be highly valuable, was reported as a motivation for people dismantling items of unexploded ordnance, and suffering death or injury as a result. In some cases it was reported that unscrupulous traders may be deliberately promoting this misconception in an effort to build a market for recovered ordnance. An explosion in Chitungwiza, Zimbabwe that killed five people is attributed to a quest to reclaim red mercury from a live landmine. =Saudi Arabia= In April 2009 it was reported from Saudi Arabia that rumors that Singer sewing machines contained \\"red mercury\\" had caused the prices of such machines to massively increase in the Kingdom, with some paying up to SR200,000 for a single machine which could previously have been bought for SR200. Believers in the rumor claimed that the presence of red mercury in the sewing machines' needles could be detected using a mobile telephone; if the line cut off when the telephone was placed near to the needle, this supposedly proved that the substance was present. In Medina there was a busy trade in the sewing machines, with buyers seen using mobile phones to check the machines for red mercury content, while it was reported that others had resorted to theft, with two tailors' shops in Dhulum broken into and their sewing machines stolen. At other locales, there were rumors that a Kuwait-based multinational had been buying up the Singer machines, while in Al-Jouf, the residents were led to believe that a local museum was buying up any such machines that it could find, and numerous women appeared at the museum offering to sell their Singer machines. There was little agreement among believers in the story as to the exact nature or even color of the red mercury, while the supposed uses for it ranged from it being an essential component of nuclear power, to having the ability to summon jinn, extract gold, or locate buried treasure and perform other forms of magic. The official spokesman for the Riyadh police said that the rumors had been started by gangs attempting to swindle people out of their money, and denied the existence of red mercury in sewing machines. Fictional references In the 2006 video game Splinter Cell: Double Agent, Red Mercury is used by the terrorist group JBA, to create multiple nuclear devices intended to bomb three major American cities. In the 1995 PlayStation game Warhawk, red mercury is used by the mad warlord Kreel in his bid for world domination. In the second episode of the third series of Spooks, a rumour that a chemist has developed red mercury is spread by MI5 to draw out a terrorist group. Red mercury is the basis of a 2005 film of the same name. In the 2013 Red 2, red mercury was the fissionable ingredient used to create a nuclear bomb with no fallout. The \\"red matter\\" seen in the 2009 reboot of Star Trek may have been inspired by red mercury. In the Bengali movie Sagardwipey Jawker Dhan, red mercury is described as a possible substitute for exhausting fossil fuels. In season four of Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, Lucifer offers red mercury to Nick Scratch as a powerful drug. In the season four episode ‚ÄúMayhem‚Äù of Criminal Minds, Reid claims that a bomb that had exploded was likely made from oxidizing agents including red mercury. In season 3 of Salem, Red Mercury is said to be a weapon used by agents of evil to destroy whole cities; setting everything afire.

Built by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Division of Litton Industries at Pascagoula, Mississippi, the ship was named for Lieutenant Commander Arthur J. Elliot II, USN (1933-1968), who as commanding officer of Patrol Boat River Squadron 57, was killed in action in the Republic of Vietnam on 29 December 1968.  1977 - 1981  Elliot got underway on 24 January 1977 for her maiden voyage, transiting from Pascagoula, Mississippi, to San Diego, California, via the Panama Canal. She was assigned to the U.S. Pacific Fleet as a unit of Destroyer Squadron 9 (DesRon 9), under the administrative control of Commander, Cruiser Destroyer Group Five and Commander, Naval Surface Forces Pacific. After arrival, Elliot conducted five weeks of shakedown training and participated in a combat exercise. Following these evolutions, she returned to her builders for a post shakedown yard availability. After leaving the yard, Elliot sailed to Rockland, Maine arriving on 25 August. Neighboring Thomaston was the hometown of the sailor for whom the ship was named. During a four-day stay, the ship hosted several thousand guests and embarked 650 guests for a six-hour guest cruise. On 24 September Elliot reported to Long Beach Naval Shipyard for a six-month restricted yard availability during which her NATO Sea Sparrow and Harpoon missile systems were installed. On 1 August 1978 Elliot shifted from the operational command of Destroyer Squadron Nine to Destroyer Squadron 31 (DesRon 31). Elliot departed for her first deployment, a seven-month Western Pacific tour, on 21 February 1979 as flagship of DesRon 31 in company with the aircraft carrier . On 31 March, Elliot departed Subic Bay, Philippines with Ranger, for operations in the Indian Ocean. Less than a week later, Elliot was transiting the Strait of Malacca in lead of Ranger when the carrier was involved in a collision with the oil tanker M/V Fortune resulting in the carrier having to return to Subic Bay for repairs. Elliot arrived in Diego Garcia on 12 April. Elliot then joined a battle group centered around and participated in operations in the Gulf of Aden to maintain a U.S. military presence in the area. Elliot returned to Subic Bay on 15 June. Elliot was awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal for Indian Ocean contingency operations. Elliot arrived back at her homeport from her first deployment on 9 September 1979. Also notable on this deployment was Elliot tailing Soviet carrier Minsk for five days of observation of operations. Elliot (foreground) conducting surveillance operations against the Soviet carrier Minsk Elliot began her second deployment in 1980. On 23 January 1981, Elliot suffered a main bearing casualty resulting in one of her gas turbine engines having to be replaced. This replacement was completed at Subic Bay in 2 days. On 21 April Elliot encountered the first of several refugee boats. Over the next eight days Elliot picked up 158 refugees for which the crew was awarded the Humanitarian Service Medal. Port visits on this deployment included stops in Hawaii, Guam, Korea, Thailand, Hong Kong, Philippines, Japan, and Singapore. She returned from this deployment on 23 May.  1981 - 1985  On 1 June 1981 Elliot was transferred to Destroyer Squadron 21. Elliot reported to Todd Pacific Shipyard in Seattle, Washington on 17 August for the first private sector overhaul ever conducted of a Spruance-class destroyer. Among other refurbishments and installations during this overhaul Elliot received an SLQ-32(V)2 electronic warfare system. Elliot completed overhaul on 30 April 1982. She returned to her homeport of NS San Diego on 21 May. On 1 July Elliot was reassigned from DesRon 21 to DesRon 17. Elliot departed San Diego, California on 13 April 1983 for the third deployment of her career. Port visits on this deployment included stops in Hawaii, Philippines, Korea, Japan, Thailand, Guam and Hong Kong. On 31 July, a small boat was spotted by the forward lookout. A total of 68 Vietnamese refugees were subsequently rescued and were turned over to state officials in Subic Bay. Elliot was again awarded the Humanitarian Service Medal for her rescue operation. During August, Elliot endured being at sea through the combined forces of two typhoons, though no significant damage resulted. On 1 September, Elliot departed Sasebo, Japan on four hours' notice, to respond to the downing of KAL 007. Elliot steamed at 32 knots (60 km/h) for a thousand miles (1,900 km) and arrived approximately 48 hours later, the first Allied ship on station. \\"Elliot\\" remained on scene until 14 September along with other units of Allied nations (U.S., Korea, Japan). During the tense days immediately after the downing, \\"Elliot\\" encountered some thirty-two Soviet ships in the SAS area, most of which were men-of-war. \\"Elliot\\" and all Soviet combatant ships were at a continuous state of General Quarters (Battle Stations), with deck weapons ready to fire. Elliot returned from her third deployment on 18 November 1983. On 27 January 1984, Elliot conducted a safe weapons offload at the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station. Shortly after departing this facility, Elliot struck a subsurface obstruction in the Seal Beach channel, causing some limited damage to the underwater hull and the starboard propeller. On 2 February, Elliot commenced a planned three month selected repair availability (SRA) period in San Diego. On 30 April, Elliot proceeded to the Todd Shipyard facilities in San Pedro, California for repairs to her starboard propeller and sonar dome. In May, Elliot shifted operational command to Destroyer Squadron 5. In October, Elliot participated in Fleet Week '84 festivities with 18 other ships in San Francisco, California. Elliot hosted more than 10,000 visitors during this event.  1985 - 2003  On 10 July 1985, Elliot departed on her fourth deployment as part of the battle group. Port visits on this deployment included stops in Hawaii, Japan, Korea, Philippines, Brunei, and Hong Kong. In mid-September Elliot was engaged in an exercise with Republic of Korea ships. During the exercise, Elliot rendered on-scene assistance to the which was disabled during a collision with the merchant ship Kansas Getty. On 1 December Elliot departed Subic Bay in company with the battle group for transit to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii arriving on 12 December. Elliot returned to her San Diego homeport on 21 December, ending her fourth deployment. In May 1986 Elliot began a two-month selected repair availability which included installation of flight deck modifications necessary to support LAMPS Mk III helicopter operations. On 11 October Elliot arrived at San Francisco to participate in Fleet Week '87 festivities. Elliot in November 1987 prior to removal of ASROC and addition of CIWS. In January 1987, Elliot departed on her fifth deployment. Highlights off this deployment included operations in the Bering Strait. Elliot received a major overhaul in the 1988 / 1989 time frame, receiving, among other things, VLS, Phalanx CIWS, new TACAN and an upgraded Sea Sparrow system including MK 23 TAS radar. Elliot during PACEX '89 showing CIWS, Sea Sparrow modifications. Additional MK 23 TAS and new TACAN on aft mast. Elliot departed San Diego on 9 September 1989 to participate in PACEX-89, said to be the largest major naval exercise in the Pacific since the close of World War II.Elliot's course took it north to the Gulf of Alaska, then on to the Bering Sea, the northwest Pacific, East China Sea, and the Sea of Japan. Elliot made its sole port stop at Sasebo, Japan before returning home on 9 November 1989. During PACEX-89, Elliot conducted joint operations with other units of the Pacific Fleet as well as elements of the Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force. Elliot and its battlegroup were also overflown by two Soviet TU-95 Bear D reconnaissance aircraft. Another highlight was the group photograph Elliot participated in as one of fifty ships gathered in formation. Elliot departed San Diego for WestPac-90 on 1 February 1990 as part of the Carrier Battlegroup \\"Charlie.\\" Ports visited included Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; Pusan, Korea; Subic Bay, Philippines; Singapore; Pattaya Beach, Thailand; Diego Garcia, BIOT; Muscat, Oman; Fremantle; and Hong Kong. Elliot also participated in Team Spirit 1990 exercises with the South Korean military. While transiting the South China Sea on 20 April 1990, Elliot rescued 35 Vietnamese refugees left adrift in a derelict boat and claiming to be the victims of pirates. Elliot's captain, CDR Timothy LaFleur, made the determination to embark the refugees and scuttle their boat. After the refugees were fed and clothed (many in clothes donated by crewmembers), Elliot turned them over to a representative of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees in Singapore on 21 April. Elliot returned from deployment on 1 August 1990, one day before Iraq invaded Kuwait. Elliot then entered the NASSCO yards on 9 September 1990 and remained there until 17 December, thus spending the majority of the Persian Gulf War on the sidelines. Elliot deployed for WestPac-91 on 31 July 1991 with COMDESRON 17 embarked. Port visits were made to Pearl Harbor; Subic Bay; Phuket, Thailand; Bahrain; Oman; Abu Dhabi, UAE; and Hong Kong. On 21 October, while deployed off the coast of Kuwait, Elliot was alerted by the French DGSE ship Le Berry to the presence of a drifting Iraqi LUGM-145 mine approximately 12 nm offshore from Kuwait's Mina Al-Ahmadi port. Explosive Ordnance Disposal Mobile Unit One, Detachment 31 team members were flown in from Bahrain. With the assistance of Elliot's air detachment the mine was safely detonated, resulting in a plume of water hundreds of feet tall. Elliot spent the Christmas holiday in Hong Kong before returning to San Diego on 20 January 1992. Elliot reported to Southwest Marine Shipyard, San Diego in May 1992 for a yard period where she remained until August. On 16 November Elliot departed San Diego for a five-week counter narcotics cruise. This cruise included a port stop in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Elliot returned from this cruise on 21 December. In June 1993, Elliot arrived in Portland, Oregon for the Portland Rose Festival. On 9 July Elliot departed San Diego for her next deployment. Port visits on this deployment included Hawaii, Guam, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Diego Garcia, Australia, and Fiji. By late August, Elliot was operating off the coast of Iran. Elliot continued operating in this region into November, serving as anti-air warfare commander and Persian Gulf force over-the-horizon track coordinator for portions of this time period. She also frequently conducted contingency strike operations exercises. During these operations, Elliot participated in boardings of merchant vessels in support of United Nations Security Council resolutions. :[1993-2003] Elliot operated out of San Diego, California until she was decommissioned on 2 December 2003. =Awards= * Navy Unit Commendation - (Aug 1998) * Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation - (Sep 1983, Sep 1989-Jul 1990, Dec 1992-May 1993, Jan 1999-Sep 2001) * Battle \\"E\\" - (1979, 1981, 1992, 1993) * Navy Expeditionary Medal - (Apr-Jun 1979) * Southwest Asia Service Medal - (Sep-Dec 1991) * Humanitarian Service Medal - (21-27 Apr 1981, 31 Jul 1983) Fate The decommissioned Elliot and were sunk off the eastern coast of Australia as part of Exercise Talisman Sabre, Elliot on 22 June 2005 and William H.

It is located northeast of Downtown Toronto, in the vicinity of Eglinton Avenue East and Bayview Avenue. The area takes its name from William Lea and the Lea family, who settled there in the early years of the 19th century.Brown, p. 198. The area first developed as farmland along with Toronto through the 19th century. It was incorporated as a town in 1913. In 1967, it amalgamated with the township of East York to form the borough of East York. In 1998, it became part of the city of Toronto. It is commonly seen as one of the most expensive and exclusive neighbourhoods in the city with a median household income of $129,930, serving upper-middle-class families. History =Early history= The general area of Toronto had been inhabited by various Natives at least as early as 3000 BCE, when the Laurentian peoples moved south into the area just east of Toronto.Pitfield, p. 3. The first European known to travel to the area was √âtienne Br√ªl√©, who passed through the area in the early part of the 17th century. Surveying by Europeans began in earnest in the 1780s, with people fleeing the American Revolution.Pitfield, p. 4. John Lea Sr. was born in 1773 in Lancashire and immigrated to York, Upper Canada in 1819, coming from Philadelphia in the United States where they immigrated to in 1818.Rempel, p. 2.Pitfield, p. 5. Before immigrating, he married Mary Hutchison (born in Cumberland) and they had their first child in Lanchester on May 28, 1814 and named him William Lea. He purchased Lot 13 in the third concession from Alexander McDonnell on January 23, 1820 and settled there with his family.Rempel, p. 3. John Lea Sr. had three children - William, John Jr. and Mary. In 1851, William Lea bought land just south of his father's farm, and began constructing a large, octagonal brick house, which he named \\"Leaside\\". The house was completed in 1854, the same year John Lea Sr. died, aged 81.Rempel, p. 4.Pitfield, p. 7. The building served not only as a home and court house for William Lea's family, but after he became a Magistrate in the County of York, soon served as a residence, a town hall and a post office as well.Pitfield, p. 8. The property became the possession of William's eldest son Joseph upon his death in 1893. Joseph lived in the octagonal house until 1903. Afterwards, it was abandoned and later demolished by the Canadian Northern Railway in 1913. The company later set fire to the old landmark in order to clear the land to make way for the company's proposed sidings and townsite.Pitfield, p. 11. Original Leaside railway station in 1899. The station was completed in 1894 by Canadian Pacific Railway. In the 1870s, the Ontario and Quebec Railway Company purchased a few acres (hectares) of land on the south-east corner of William Lea's property to run its railway across. The Ontario and Quebec Railway Company encountered financial difficulties in 1884, and leased part of its railway, including the section of track running through Leaside, to the Canadian Pacific Railway for 999 years.Rempel, p. 13. The Canadian Pacific Railway decided to establish a maintenance stop and a sliding by-pass on the railway on the land purchased from William Lea, which was considered attractive because it was uniformly flat. The station was completed in September 1894 and named \\"Leaside\\" in honour of William Lea.Rempel, p. 14. In 1892, a junction was built in the Leaside area, and a railway line named the Don Branch was constructed south along the Don River towards the original Union Station on Toronto's waterfront.Pitfield, p. 17. =Development of a model town= Road map of Leaside (highlighted in green) in 1915. A planned community was developed around the railway's maintenance yard in the early 20th century. In 1912, William Mackenzie and Donald Mann, the owners of the Canadian Northern Railway, hired landscape architect Frederick Todd to plan development for a community to be built around a maintenance yard for their railway,Brown, p. 199. which ran beside the CP lines through the Leaside area. Mackenzie and Todd founded the York Land Company to purchase land for such a town. The company purchased over , including most of the third concession and some land north of Eglinton Avenue. The purchased lands extended from the railway tracks in the south to three farms north of Eglinton Avenue, from Leslie Street in the east to Bayview Avenue in the west.Pitfield, p. 22. The town of Leaside was planned by Todd for the company, which put its name to many of the local streets; Laird Drive, Hanna Road, and Wicksteed Avenue all bear the name of Canadian Northern Railway company executives. The new community was planned with commercial areas, residential areas, and a town centre west of Laird Drive, and space was laid out east of Laird Drive for industrial development. The goal of the company was to create Leaside as a new upper class residential area of Toronto, the \\"New Rosedale\\". The developers first approached the town of North Toronto, hoping that North Toronto would annex the area and provide services such as streets, sewers, and public transportation. The town council of North Toronto refused.Pitfield, p. 32. A similar request to the city of Toronto was met with a similar reply. With their attempts to include Leaside within another city or town rebuffed, Colonel Davidson and Randolph McRae applied to the province of Ontario to incorporate Leaside as a town. The Town of Leaside was officially incorporated on April 23, 1913.Rempel, p. 1. The population of Leaside was 43. The Canadian Northern Railway company approved Todd's town plan on May 8, 1913.Rempel, p. 17. A town council for Leaside was elected on May 8, 1913 and they approved the plan for the town on May 21, 1913, which was the final legal approval needed before the plan could be implemented. On June 21, 1913, the Toronto World carried the announcement that properties in Leaside's planned community would be marked in the fall of that year. In September 1913, lots went on sale within the planned community. In 1914, the industrial area that had been set aside east of Laird Drive received its first tenant. Canada Wire and Cable began construction of a factory for production of 9.2 inch shells for World War I.Rempel, p. 21. In addition to the new factory, Canada Wire and Cable moved their other Toronto production plants to the same location to increase efficiency. Canada Wire and Cable also created the subsidiary company Leaside Munitions Company to oversee shell production. Soon after, construction began on a federal government owned airstrip, named Leaside Aerodrome. The York Land Company leased about to the government for the airfield, between Wicksteed Avenue and Eglinton Avenue. On May 21, 1917 construction began on the airfield. At the close of the war, there were accommodations for around 1000 military personnel.Rempel, p. 22. Members of the Toronto Flight Club prepare to take-off from Leaside Aerodrome, 1930. The Aerodrome was operated from 1917 to 1944. While the industrial development in the area went ahead as planned during World War One, the anticipated residential development did not occur.Pitfield, p. 23. As late as 1929 the population remained under 500. World War I spurred the demand for industrial output but diminished the call for new housing. The bankruptcy of Canadian Northern Railway left the project at a loss and Leaside's isolated location made it unappealing to workers from Toronto. =Growth as a suburb of Toronto= After the war, the strip became the site of Canada's first delivery of airmail on June 18, 1918, when pilot Brian Peck delivered 120 letters from Montreal, Quebec. This delivery was initially organised at the behest of some of his friends in Montreal who wanted letters delivered to Toronto; however, when Canada Post heard of the plans, they gathered together the letters as a test of an airmail system. After the war, with little need for shells and other war materials, the factories of the Leaside Munition Company were closed. These buildings were quickly occupied by the Durant Motor Company, which produced cars named Durants and Stars as well as the Rugby truck. Leaside's growth slowed after World War I, with its primary industry being war industry. The existing houses had all been built for employees of the Leaside Munitions Company by the company.Rempel, p. 25. However, at this time Leaside stood on the edge of Toronto and was increasingly an appealing place for investment. Investors from Baltimore bought property that had previously belonged to Robert T. Davies for the construction of a race track. They formed the Thorncliffe Park Racing and Breeding Association Ltd. to operate the track. Street view of Leaside Viaduct in April 1928, nearly six months after its official opening. The Leaside Viaduct was completed on October 29, 1927, providing easy connection between east Toronto and Leaside. This led to the rapid growth of Leaside at the time, and in the future. The impassibility of the Don River valley had previously made it difficult for people employed in Toronto to reside in Leaside. The same month, an underpass on Millwood Road was opened through the valley. In 1928, the Lincoln Electric Company of Canada Ltd. relocated from Toronto's west end to Leaside. The company originally sold Lincoln motors in Canada, but incorporated in 1930 and began the manufacture of motors in Leaside.Pitfield, p. 66. At the onset of the Great Depression, the Durant Motor Company ran into financial troubles. The last cars were produced in 1933, and the buildings were occupied by the Canada Wire and Cable company.Pitfield, p. 54. At the start of World War II, Lincoln Electric moved their operations to Leaside industrial park, adjacent to the Canada Wire and Cable plant. The new location, constructed in 1940, covered .Pitfield, p67. On July 16, 1940, Research Enterprises Limited was incorporated. The company operated only during the war, closing in 1946. It was, however, the largest single employer in Leaside's history, employing over 7500 men and women at its peak.Pitfield, p. 84. The site manufactured military radio equipment and optical supplies, with a total value of $220 million (CDN) in goods produced during the war. Aerial photograph of Leaside, 1942. During the Second World War, the area was home to several industrial operations. As part of a Royal Canadian Air Force public relations plan, the town of Leaside officially \\"adopted\\" No. 432 Squadron RCAF of No. 6 Group RCAF. Formed and adopted on 1 May 1943, the squadron took the town's name as its nickname, becoming 432 \\"Leaside\\" squadron RCAF. The sponsorship lasted the duration of the war. In 1945, at the end of World War II, the population of Leaside stood at 9,800. In 1949, Leaside's population had grown to 14,826. On May 14, 1952, the Sunnybrook Plaza, located on the north-east corner of Bayview Avenue and Eglinton Avenue East, became one of the first shopping centres in Toronto. The site was previously a marsh where people dug loam for their gardens. In 1952 the Lincoln Electric company expanded to a plant, and their site expanded to cover almost . They leased an additional building in Leaside to house their distribution center. The last horse race at Thorncliffe Park was run on June 23, 1952.Rempel, p.26. Investors from Toronto bought the racetrack that year. The rapid growth of Thorncliffe in the 1950s necessitated the construction of a second north‚Äìsouth bridge across the Don Valley. In 1955, Leaside's population had grown to 16,779 and the Leaside town council approved the second bridge. Construction of the bridge was completed on September 7, 1960 and it was opened by Leslie Frost. The bridge was named the Charles Hiscott Bridge in honour of Leaside's mayor at the time. =Amalgamation and recent history= In 1967, Leaside amalgamated with the township of East York to form the borough of East York. As such Leaside became a neighbourhood within East York. Passenger train service to Leaside Station ended in 1970, and the station was closed.Pitfield, p. 20. The station would reopen briefly in the 1980s as a restaurant, but would see no further passenger traffic. Leaside Airport fell into disuse, and in 1971 the last hangar was demolished.Brown, p. 200. Canada Wire and Cable was purchased by Alcatel in 1991, and the operations relocated to Markham in 1996, with the location being converted to a shopping centre.Pitfield, p 46. The plant had expanded through the years and been a major influence in Leaside, employing over 2700 workers at its peak. It had also been a strong influence over the community in other ways, investing in the community in various ways, including the construction of a water main in 1918.Pitfield, p.42 East York merged with five other municipalities in 1998 to form the new City of Toronto. Line 5 Eglinton, also known as the Eglinton Crosstown LRT, will have 3 stations in Leaside when completed in 2021: underground stations at Bayview Avenue and at Laird Drive, and a grade level station at Leslie Street.  Geography  Crothers Woods is a local park that is a part of the Toronto ravine system and sits south of Leaside. The neighbourhood is situated on the Iroquois Plains around the ravine system. Leaside lies on the Iroquois Plain.Pitfield, p. 2. The actions of the glacial Lake Iroquois made the Leaside area into a flat plateau, surrounded on three sides by deep river valleys.  Culture  Leaside is made up predominantly of single-family homes housing upper-middle-class families. The most famous house in Leaside is James Lea's, located at 201 Sutherland Drive. Built in 1909, it is unique in that the back of the house faces Sutherland Drive. It was originally built to face a street that no longer exists. Due to city expansion, Leaside has become prime real estate with the GTA, and has attracted many local celebrities, such as NHL goaltender Trevor Kidd, Avalanche winger Darcy Tucker, Ex-NHL player Doug Gilmour, and comedian Colin Mochrie and his actress wife Deb McGrath. =Recreation= The largest recreation centre in Leaside is Leaside Memorial Community Gardens which includes an indoor swimming pool, two ice rinks, a curling rink, and a large auditorium. It also was where Peter Mahovlich Sr., father of the famous NHL brothers, worked after coming to Toronto in the 1950s from the Timmins area, because of Frank's impressive hockey skills as a youth in the Porcupine. Serena Gundy Park is in the north-east corner of Leaside. The parkland was donated to Leaside in 1960 by the estate of James H. Gundy. The park covers which are generally in a natural state. The park is used for picnicking and hiking in the summer and cross country skiing in the winter. The park is also connected by walking paths to Sunnybrook Park. Trace Manes Park is in south Leaside. The park is home to the Leaside Tennis club and sports six tennis courts. Other facilities in the park include a playground, a baseball diamond, and an outdoor ice rink in winter. Howard Talbot park in south-west Leaside features two baseball diamonds. Additionally it features a \\"splash pad\\", a water playground for young children. Education Northlea Elementary and Middle School is located on the site of the old Divadale Estate on Rumsey Road north of Eglinton Avenue. It was opened in 1944 and had 15 classrooms. In 1991‚Äì93, the school underwent extensive renovations and the school now educates over 800 students. The renovation provided additional classroom space to the school as well as a new library, and second gymnasium. The playing field is artificial turf. The school is operated by the Toronto District School Board. Northlea is a dual track school offering regular English programs from Junior Kindergarten to Grade 8, and French Immersion programs from Senior Kindergarten to Grade 8. Northlea welcomes commuters for the impressive French Immersion programs. Opened in 1945, Leaside High School is a secular English public secondary school operated by the Toronto District School Board. Bessborough Elementary and Middle School, located close to Leaside High School in South Leaside, has offered education to those living in the older part of Leaside. St. Anselm Catholic School, also located on Bessborough Drive, opened in 1939 and presently has an enrollment of 340 students from Junior Kindergarten to Grade 8. Rolph Road Elementary School, an elementary school for junior kindergarten to grade 6, is the other elementary school in the neighbourhood. Located on Rolph Road, it is in South Leaside and is a feeder school to Bessborough. Leaside High School began on the top floor of Rolph Road School in 1945. The \\"new\\" high school opened in September 1948 and welcomed back local students who had been attending Lawrence Park and Jarvis Collegiate. Along with the growth of these schools in the 1940s and 1950s, the growing population of Leaside also supported one of North Toronto's first preschools. Sunnybrook School was founded in 1952 in the basement of St. Augustine of Canterbury Church in Leaside. In 1960 the school moved to its present 469 Merton Street location, just west of Leaside in Davisville. In addition to the Toronto District School Board, three other public school boards also operate in the city. The Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB), is a public English separate school board; Conseil scolaire Viamonde is a secular French public school board; and the Conseil scolaire de district catholique Centre-Sud is a French separate public school board. However, the French school boards do not operate a school in the Leaside neighbourhood. St. Anselm Catholic School is a coeducational, Catholic, elementary school in the south of Toronto, Ontario. It was named after the philosopher and theologian of Canterbury, Saint Anselm. It was established in 1939, with only 2 classrooms under principal Mary Breen. Additions to the school were made in 1943, 1947 and 1951. The library and gymnasium were added in 1966. Today the school serves students from Kindergarten to 8th grade. In 1997, the MSSB/TCDSB made funds for the school to be a two-story building. When the school was being renovated, the students were moved to 1107 Avenue Road, which is now Marshall McLuhan. The students came back to the newly renovated school in 1998. Bloorview School Authority is an educational facility physically located within the Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital in north Leaside, although they are each separate legal entities. The Bloorview School Authority offers various educational programs for children, some of whom are patients in the hospital.

Politics  The first town council for Leaside was elected on May 8, 1913. The council had five members: Randolph McRae, who served as the mayor, and Harvey Fitzsimmons, Laurence Boulton, George Saunders and Archibald McRae who served as aldermen. All were acclaimed in the election, all were employees of the Canadian Northern Railway. From 1913 to 1966, Leaside had its own mayor. The last four occupants were - Howard T. Burrell (1951‚Äì1955); Charles H. Hiscott (1956‚Äì1961); Lloyd M. Dickinson (1962); Beth Nealson (1963‚Äì1966). In 1967, Leaside was amalgamated with the township of East York to form the borough of East York, from this point forward Leaside was a community within East York, and governed by the municipal council of East York. Amalgamation was opposed by Leaside residents fearing residential tax increases and the loss of the Leaside community identity. Taxes in Leaside were lower than the surrounding regions as residential taxes in Leaside were subsidized by those from industrial areas; residential taxes climbef in Leaside every year from 1967 to 1972.Pitfield, p. 26. Beth Nealson, the last mayor of Leaside ran against True Davidson (the reeve of East York) for mayor of the amalgamated borough. Nealson lost to Davidson. In 1998, East York (including Leaside) was amalgamated with the City of Toronto to form the City of Toronto, from this point forward Leaside was a community within Toronto, and governed by the municipal council of Toronto. In 2006, incumbent Don Valley West councillor Jane Pitfield, whose ward included Leaside, ran for mayor. Former Progressive Conservative MPP John Parker won her former seat in that year's election. In the 2010 Toronto municipal election that saw Rob Ford elected to the office of Mayor of Toronto, Parker won another tight race for councillor of Ward 26, beating runner up Jon Burnside by only 415 votes. After a tumultuous term of increased traffic in the neighbourhood and rapid development along the Laird Drive corridor and in Thorncliffe Park, Parker lost the seat to Burnside by a margin of 3,248 votes. =Mayors of the Town of Leaside= Mayors of Leaside fron the town's incorporation until its merger into East York. *1913-1914 Randolph McRae - former official in the Canadian Northern Railway's Land Department *1915-1923 Robert Phipps Ormsby - secretary of the Canadian National RailwaySAY THIS MAYOR SHOULD LOSE JOB: C.N.R.

Written by Brian Hayles and an uncredited Terrance Dicks and directed by Michael Ferguson, it originally aired in six weekly parts on BBC1 from 25 January to 1 March 1969. It sees the return of the Ice Warriors, previously introduced by Hayles in the 1967 serial The Ice Warriors. The serial is set in London and on the Moon in the 21st century. In the serial, the time traveller the Second Doctor (Patrick Troughton) and his travelling companions Jamie McCrimmon (Frazer Hines) and Zoe Heriot (Wendy Padbury), along with the technicians Gia Kelly (Louise Pajo) and Phipps (Christopher Coll), try to prevent the Ice Warriors' plot to make the Earth's atmosphere inhospitable to humans but viable for the Ice Warriors to invade. Plot At the end of the twenty-first century, a teleportation technology called \\"T-Mat\\" has replaced all traditional forms of transport, allowing people and objects to travel instantly anywhere on Earth. Manned space exploration has ceased due to the ease of life on Earth. The Doctor, Jamie McCrimmon and Zoe Herriot arrive in a museum on Earth run by Professor Daniel Eldred dedicated to the obsolete technology of rockets. However, something goes amiss at the T-Mat vital relay station on the Moon and the system breaks down. With communications out, and no way to reach the Moon without T-Mat, those responsible for the system, Commander Radnor and his assistant Gia Kelly, turn to Professor Eldred to help. He has been privately building a rocket in hopes of re-igniting interest in space travel. The Doctor and his companions volunteer to crew the rocket. The Doctor also comments that the TARDIS is not suitable for short range use after Zoe informs Jamie that the TARDIS would most likely overshoot by a couple of million years. The relay station on the Moon has been invaded by Ice Warriors, a militant Martian race, who plan to use it as a staging point for an invasion of Earth. The technicians attempt to fight the invaders but several are killed, while Phipps goes into hiding and Fewsham is pressed into assisting the invaders. Fewsham repairs the T-Mat link on receive mode and Miss Kelly beams through to start repairing the T-Mat system. When the Doctor and his companions arrive on the Moon they make contact with Phipps, who is hiding in the moonbase. The Doctor accidentally reveals himself to the Ice Warriors and their leader Commander Slaar. The Ice Warriors have a deadly plan: they have seeds, which they send to various parts of Earth using T-mat, of a fungus that will multiply and suck all the oxygen from the surrounding atmosphere, making it more comfortable for the Martians but uninhabitable for humans. Once the full T-Mat relay is repaired, one seed is sent to Earth Control and explodes, killing a technician and alerting Radnor and Eldred of the danger. The seed soon creates foam, which multiplies its effects and imperils more and more people. Other T-Mat terminals across the world receive more seeds. The Ice Warriors also use T-Mat to dispatch a small advance force to seize Earth's weather control systems in London and ensure good conditions for the growth of the fungus. On the Moon Miss Kelly and Phipps work with Zoe and Jamie to stage diversions and attacks against the Ice Warriors. During their main assault to free the Doctor, Phipps is killed. The Ice Warriors have now retreated to their spacecraft to plan the next stage of their invasion, leaving an opportunity for most of the captives to flee. Fewsham, however, remains behind, seemingly fearing an enquiry into his actions if he returns to Earth. In T-Mat control on Earth, the Doctor works out that the seed pods can be defeated using water. This explains where the Ice Warrior beamed to Earth has gone, and the Doctor tracks him down to the weather control system, where the alien has been stationed to prevent any rain fall that would be deadly to the pods. The Doctor and his allies recapture the weather control system and summon rain, destroying the fungus, which is used to the dry conditions on Mars. Fewsham has meanwhile delivered a crushing blow to the Ice Warriors. He dupes Slaar into revealing in a live link with Earth that the main invasion force is following a homing signal to the Moon, for which he is killed. But at least the Doctor now knows the full extent of the Ice Warrior plans. He returns to the moonbase by T-mat to set a new signal for the Martian fleet from there. The Doctor confronts Slaar while substituting the alternative signal. This draws the Martian fleet away and lures it into the Sun. Slaar moves to kill the Doctor in revenge but the arrival of Jamie in a T-Mat cubicle causes chaos, and Slaar is killed in one of the sonic beams of the last of his warriors. Jamie then kills the surviving Martian and the invasion is over. The Doctor and Jamie return to Earth and then make their goodbyes before departing in the TARDIS with Zoe. Production Although Brian Hayles is solely credited as the story's author, series script editor Terrance Dicks rewrote Episodes 3 to 6 of the script. This was partly because he considered Hayles's original ending lacklustre and unworkable, but also because originally Jamie McCrimmon was to have been replaced by a new companion called Nik by this story; actor Frazer Hines postponed his departure, however. Dicks was co-credited on the sleeve of the VHS release for his writing duties on the serial. Patrick Troughton does not appear in Episode 4 as he was on holiday when it was being recorded. A double stands in for him in some shots where the Doctor is seen unconscious on the floor. =Cast notes= This story is the first story to feature Alan Bennion in the role of an Ice Lord, this one named Slaar. Bennion would return as the Ice Lords Izlyr in The Curse of Peladon (1972) and Azaxyr in The Monster of Peladon (1974). Sonny Caldinez, who played Slaar's second in command, is the only actor to appear as an Ice Warrior in all four televised Doctor Who stories in the classic series to feature the Ice Warriors. Caldinez also appeared as Kemel in The Evil of the Daleks (1967). Ronald Leigh-Hunt played Commander Radnor in this story. Leigh-Hunt would play Commander Stevenson in Revenge of the Cybermen (1975). Harry Towb later played McDermott in Terror of the Autons (1971). Christopher Coll would later play Stubbs in The Mutants (1972). Steve Peters, who played an Ice Warrior, was billed simply as \\"Alien\\" in the Radio Times listing for episode one, so as not to spoil the surprise of the Ice Warriors' appearance. Commercial releases =In print= A novelisation of this serial, written by Dicks, was published by Target Books in July 1986. =Home media= This story was released on VHS and Betamax in 1985 in an omnibus format. In February 2003, an unedited remastered, VidFIREd version was released on Region 1 and Region 2 DVD. The story was chosen to represent the Patrick Troughton era as part of the Doctor Who 40th Anniversary releases. A special edition Region 1 and 2 DVD with expanded special features and improved picture quality was released along with similarly expanded special editions of the Carnival of Monsters and Resurrection of the Daleks as part of the Revisitations 2 DVD boxed set on 28 March 2011 exclusively in the UK.

Radford (DD-968) was a in the United States Navy. She was named for Admiral Arthur W. Radford USN (1896‚Äì1973), the first naval officer to be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Arthur W. Radford was laid down 31 January 1974 by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Division of Litton Industries at Pascagoula, Mississippi and launched on 1 March 1975, sponsored by Mrs. Arthur Radford, the admiral's widow. Arthur W. Radford was commissioned on 16 April 1977, and decommissioned on 18 March 2003, after serving 26 years. On 10 August 2011, her hull was scuttled off the coast of Delaware, to form part of an artificial reef.  Early operations  Underway for the East Coast the day she was commissioned, Arthur W. Radford was forced to return to her builder's yard for repairs soon thereafter, but got underway again on 30 April. Touching at Charleston, South Carolina, on 3 and 4 May, the ship proceeded to her home port Norfolk, Virginia, which she reached on 6 May. Three days later, she steamed for Newport, Rhode Island, to provide support for the Naval Surface Warfare Officer Training Command. While the ship proceeded north, a LAMPS helicopter practice-landed on her helo deck to prepare for the embarkation of a LAMPS III detachment. The helicopter returned to Norfolk later that day 11 May. Mooring at Newport on 13 May, the destroyer remained there until 17 May, when she headed home. Soon after returning to Norfolk, she conducted gunnery exercises and helicopter operations off the Virginia Capes. The ship headed down the coast on 24 May and reached Port Canaveral, Florida, the following day. After embarking Capt. R. K. Albright, Commander, Destroyer Squadron 22 (DesRon 22) the destroyer got underway on 27 May and, for the next few days, conducted air, surface, and sub-surface surveillance of the surrounding waters while President Jimmy Carter, observed operations on board the attack submarine . The destroyer rendezvoused with the submarine prior to her initial dive and then again when the submarine surfaced. Throughout the operation, she provided support services for local and national press covering the Chief Executive's voyage. Underway for Norfolk on 31 May, Arthur W. Radford reached her home port on 2 June for local operations. While returning from waters off the Virginia Capes on 6 June, the ship ran into low-visibility conditions and winds in excess of 90 knots (170 km/h) which disabled a radar antenna and drove the ship outside the main shipping channel. At one point her fathometer read only 30 centimeters of water under the keel. Ship's crest Fighting her way back to the channel in the teeth of the gale Arthur W. Radford sighted a capsized motor vessel, Dixie Lee II, 300 yards south of Thimble A Shoals Channel buoy 21\\\\. Unable to assist due to the shallow water and high winds, the destroyer notified the United States Coast Guard of bodies seen floating in the water. The destroyer then anchored in Hampton Roads until the wind had dropped and shipping, adrift in the vicinity, had moved off. Arthur W. Radford then proceeded to the West Indies for training operations including gunfire support. En route to Frederickstad, Saint Croix, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, in late June she conducted further weapons tests. Firing a gunnery exercise at Vieques, Puerto Rico, the destroyer returned to the eastern seaboard with a port visit to Fort Lauderdale, Florida on Independence Day 1977. During this firing exercise, a dummy shell hit which was towing a target sled. Further work in the Bahamas, and at Guantanamo Bay, preceded her return to Charleston, South Carolina, on the last day of July. She then headed home where she arrived on 3 August. The ship returned to Pascagoula on 11 September for post- shakedown availability and remained in her builder's hands until she returned to Norfolk in mid-October. Entering the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 25 October for restricted availability, she remained there into the spring of 1978 before resuming local operations out of her home port. She principally engaged in ship qualification trials and underway training before steaming south to Guantanamo Bay and Vieques for refresher training and gunfire support practice, respectively. Following these evolutions, the ship returned to Norfolk on 30 July 1978. On 23 August, Arthur W. Radford got underway from the Naval Weapons Station Yorktown Virginia, and headed for NATO exercises in the North Atlantic. En route, she participated in Exercise \\"Common Effort\\", carrying out escort duties in an \\"opposed Atlantic transit\\", and briefly embarked Vice Admiral Wesley L. McDonald, Commander, U.S. 2nd Fleet. Next came Operation \\"Northern Wedding\\" a joint NATO exercise which began on 4 September and involved several carrier groups in an amphibious landing and many other facets of simulated naval warfare. During that operation, Arthur W. Radford operated alongside Royal Navy, Royal Danish Navy, Royal Norwegian Navy, Swedish Navy, West German Navy, and Canadian Forces Maritime naval units. During this exercise, the ship encountered huge seas from Hurricane Flossie. Following the conclusion of \\"Northern Wedding\\", the destroyer visited Copenhagen, Denmark; Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and Portsmouth, England. She again embarked VADM McDonald at Portsmouth on 16 October and wore his flag during the return voyage to Norfolk. The admiral disembarked upon her arrival at Norfolk on 25 October. The destroyer then operated locally through the winter, varying periods between in port for upkeep and getting underway for training.  First deployment and interim  Arthur W. Radford cleared Norfolk on 13 March 1979, bound for the Mediterranean and a tour with the U.S. 6th Fleet. Over the next six months, she participated in a variety of exercises and visited the ports of Catania, Sicily; Split, Yugoslavia; Trieste, Italy; Alexandria, Egypt; Cannes, France, Palma, Spain; Barcelona, Spain; Toulon, France, Th√©oule, France, Rota, Spain and Valencia, Spain. During the deployment, the vessel fired her first Harpoon missile in the Mediterranean on 28 July. Her target was the hulk of a destroyer, ex- (later the Turkish TCG Gaziantep (D-344)). Arthur W. Radford also participated in Exercise \\"Multiplex 1-79\\" in the Ionian Sea, Exercise \\"Dawn Patrol\\" in the Tyrrhenian Sea and Ionian Seas, Exercise \\"Tridente\\" out of Alexandria, and Exercise \\"National Week\\" XXVII, Phases 1 and 2. While en route from Toulon to Theoule, France, she rescued the French ketch, Laurca, adrift from the French resort of St. Tropez. Clearing Rota on 12 September, Arthur W. Radford reached Norfolk on 22 September. Underway for Miami, Florida on 23 October, she served as the platform for deck landing qualifications for helicopter pilots en route, and, after touching at Mayport, Florida to unload a crippled H 3 helicopter from HSL-30, reached Miami on 27 October for a two-day port visit. After returning briefly to Norfolk from 31 October to 5 November, the destroyer proceeded to Halifax, Nova Scotia, and participated in a training exercise with American and Canadian warships. During the course of Exercise \\"Canus-Marcot\\" she logged her 1,000th helicopter landing of 1979. Returning to Norfolk on 21 November, she remained in port for the remainder of the year 1979. For the first half of 1980, the warship principally operated off the eastern seaboard of the United States, and ranged as far north as Halifax and as far south as the Caribbean, working briefly out of Vieques and Roosevelt Roads Naval Station, as well as out of Jacksonville, Florida. During this time, she also visited Annapolis, Maryland, where United States Naval Academy midshipmen toured the ship's engineering plant on an orientation visit. Admiral James L. Holloway III, the former Chief of Naval Operations, visited the ship as well.  Second deployment and interim  Arthur W. Radford (DD-968) transits the Panama Canal during Unitas XXI. Following a brief period at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Arthur W. Radford prepared for another extended deployment. She departed Norfolk on 21 June 1980, embarking HSL-34, Detachment 2 and proceeded to Roosevelt Roads, where she embarked Rear Admiral Peter K. Cullins, Commander, South Atlantic Force and his staff to become Cullins' flagship for UNITAS XXI. Visits to Saint Kitts and to Bridgetown, Barbados, followed before the destroyer sailed for Venezuelan waters. Over the next four months, Arthur W. Radford operated with elements of the Venezuelan, Ecuadorian, Peruvian, Colombian, Trinidad and Tobagonian, Argentine, Uruguayan, and Brazilian navies. Her ports of call included Puerto La Cruz and La Guaira, Venezuela, Rodman, Panama, Manta, Ecuador, Paito and Callao, Peru, Cartagena, Colombia; Trinidad and Tobago, Puerto Belgrano, and Bah√≠a Blanca, Argentina, Montevideo, Uruguay, and the Brazilian ports of Santos, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador and Recife.

Completing UNITAS XXI on 4 November, Arthur W. Radford sailed for Gabon, as a unit of the West Africa Training Cruise (WATC), reaching Libreville, the capital of Gabon, on 12 November. Over the next few weeks, she visited Tema, Ghana Freetown, Sierra Leone, and Dakar, Senegal. Clearing Dakar on 1 December, the destroyer stopped at Guadeloupe and at Roosevelt Roads on the return voyage and arrived at Norfolk on 15 December. The ship spent the next two years engaged in operations along the East Coast and in the West Indies mostly in underway training out of Norfolk, Roosevelt Roads, and Vieques and in refresher training at Guantanamo Bay. During the summer of 1981, she operated out of Annapolis, training midshipmen. She underwent upkeep at Norfolk and Boston, Massachusetts, and received an overhaul at her builder's yard. En route to Puerto Rico, the ship had a Coast Guard detachment embarked from 20 to 23 September 1982, and cooperated with the Coast Guard on drug interdiction duties.  Third deployment and interim  For the first few months of 1983, Arthur W. Radford operated primarily in the Virginia Capes area, but ranged into the Atlantic as far as the Bahamas. After embarking Commander, Destroyer Squadron 26, at Norfolk on 7 March to begin a nine-month period on board, Arthur W. Radford hosted Secretary of the Navy John F. Lehman, Jr., on 29 March. A little less than one month later the destroyer cleared Norfolk on 27 April for a six-month deployment in the Mediterranean. Touching at Gibraltar on 10 May, Arthur W. Radford proceeded to Augusta Bay, Sicily, and thence moved to waters off the coast of Lebanon. After supporting the multinational peacekeeping force in Beirut from 20 May to 28 May, the destroyer visited Taranto, Italy, before returning to Lebanese waters for another brief period. During a port call at the Romanian port of Constan≈£a along with guided-missile frigate , the destroyer served as flagship for Vice Admiral William H. Rowden, Commander, 6th Fleet. Visiting Catania, Sicily, Monte Carlo, Monaco, and Livorno, Italy, Arthur W. Radford exercised with U.S. 6th Fleet battle groups later that summer, later visiting Gaeta and Naples, Italy. While visiting Istanbul, Turkey, she hosted the retired Army leader and former presidential advisor General Alexander M. Haig. Arthur W. Radford returned to the waters off Beirut on 18 September 1983 to assume duty as ready gunfire support ship. She conducted gunfire support missions against forces threatening the peacekeeping force on 21 and 22 September until relieved on station by the battleship on 8 October. Visits to La Maddalena, Sardinia, and to Tangier, Morocco rounded out the destroyer's time in the U.S. 6th Fleet. Operating briefly with Spanish Navy units en route to the turnover port of Rota, Arthur W. Radford cleared Rota on 10 November with the battle group formed around the carrier . She arrived at Norfolk 11 days later, remaining there for the rest of 1983. Arthur W. Radford operated briefly in the Virginia Capes area in January 1984 before undergoing an overhaul at the Metro Machine Shipyard at Portsmouth, Virginia, between 16 February and 27 April. Subsequently undergoing sea trials and repairs in the floating drydock , Arthur W. Radford conducted routine training out of Norfolk through early August. Arthur W. Radford performing an underway replenishment with Iowa. The destroyer next operated out of Roosevelt Roads and off St. Croix before returning to Norfolk at the end of August and becoming flagship for Destroyer Squadron 10. After then conducting underway training in the Virginia Capes area in September and October, Arthur W. Radford accompanied the recommissioned battleship to Roosevelt Roads. She later conducted gunfire support exercises off Vieques. Returning northward the destroyer took part in exercises off the coast of North Carolina before reaching to Norfolk on 20 November.  Fourth deployment and interim  After local operations, Arthur W. Radford sailed for a deployment with the Middle East Force (MidEastFor) on 4 February 1985, in company with . Rendezvousing with and near Bermuda two days later, and refueling from , the destroyer reached Rota on 16 February. She then visited Naples before heading for Egypt to transit the Suez Canal on 27 February 1985. The destroyer touched briefly at Raysut, Oman, on 8 March before transiting the Strait of Hormuz the following day and entering the Persian Gulf. After touching briefly at Bahrain Arthur W. Radford got underway on 14 March for the Persian Gulf radar picket station. Five days into her time on station, she responded to a \\"Mayday\\" from the Liberian-flag tanker Caribbean Breeze which had been attacked and set afire in the central Persian Gulf. The destroyer provided medical advice over the emergency radio channel and launched a helicopter to render assistance. Refueling on 25 March at Sitrah Anchorage, Bahrain, Arthur W. Radford got underway to resume her radar picket duty later the same day, remaining employed thus until she moored alongside for availability. The destroyer resumed steaming on radar picket station again on 8 April, also conducting surveillance operations simultaneously. Arthur W. Radford embarked Rear Admiral John Addams, Commander, Middle East Force, on 17 April, and served as his flagship until 5 June. During that time, the destroyer served twice on radar picket duties in the Persian Gulf, the first from 17 to 26 April and the second from 23 to 29 June, and once on routine cruising. She visited the Sitrah anchorage twice during this period, and visited Manama, Bahrain, twice. After Rear Admiral Addams shifted his flag from Arthur W. Radford, the ship served two more tours of radar picket duty in the Persian Gulf from 6 to 16 June and 20 to 29 June. During the first of these periods, on 7 June, the destroyer's embarked Sikorsky SH-3 \\"Sea King\\" helicopter from squadron HS-1 transported a civilian rescued from drowning and in need of medical attention to Bahrain hospital, saving the person's life. Arthur W. Radford underwent her final upkeep in the Persian Gulf at Mina Sulman, Manama, Bahrain, from 29 June to 4 July observing Independence Day there before getting underway that afternoon to transit the Persian Gulf for the Strait of Hormuz. She conducted turnover to the destroyer the following day, and exited from the gulf. Stopping for fuel at Mina Raysut, Oman, on 8 July, Arthur W. Radford transited the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb in company with Antrim on 10 July, and the two warships conducted freedom of navigation operations off the coast of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen on 11 July. The destroyer transited the Suez Canal on 14 July, and replenished from the oiler that same day. Fueling from the following day, Arthur W. Radford conducted a port visit to Benidorm, Spain, from 20 to 23 July before reaching Rota on 24 July. Proceeding thence with Antrim, Barney, and Charles F. Adams, the destroyer sailed for Norfolk on 24 July. After visiting Ponta Delgada, Azores, and Bermuda en route, Arthur W. Radford reached her home port on 5 August 1985. The destroyer remained at Norfolk into late October, preparing for a command inspection and operating locally in the Virginia Capes operating area. Early in this period, Hurricane Gloria prompted Arthur W. Radford to depart Norfolk on 13 September 1985, and proceed to the upper Chesapeake Bay anchorage to ride out the storm. The destroyer returned to her home port on 21 September. Departing Norfolk on 25 October, Arthur W. Radford sailed for Nova Scotia, and arrived at Halifax on 28 October. After being briefed for her participation in an exercise, SHAREM 62, the ship departed Halifax on the following day for Notre Dame Bay Newfoundland. Transiting the Strait of Belle Isle on 31 October Arthur W. Radford reached her destination on 1 November, and took part in SHAREM 62 until 6 November, when she sailed for Halifax. Arthur W. Radford underway near Norfolk after VLS installation, 1990. Following the post-exercise debriefing, Arthur W. Radford sailed for Norfolk, arriving at her home port on 13 November. Moving up the eastern seaboard, the destroyer visited Boston, Massachusetts (5 to 8 December) before spending a brief period at Newport serving as Surface Warfare Officer School school ship from 9 to 12 December. Arthur W. Radford then returned to the Norfolk area, unloading weapons at Naval Weapons Station Yorktown from 15 to 18 December before conducting a dependents' cruise on 18 December. The destroyer underwent a restricted availability until late March 1986, running her post-repair trials on 29 and 30 March before proceeding to Yorktown to take on weapons. Arthur W. Radford operated locally out of Norfolk into late July, interspersing this work with a drydocking in Sustain from 30 May to 17 June, for repairs to her struts and stern tubes, as well as an inspection of her sonar dome. Following refresher training in Guantanamo Bay, the ship touched at Roosevelt Roads before operating at Vieques for gunfire support practice, surface gunnery exercises, and missile shoots. After visiting Fort Lauderdale, and Florida en route, the ship returned to Norfolk on 12 September. Arthur W. Radford returned to Guantanamo Bay soon thereafter to embark HSL-36, detachment 6, and then proceeded to Roosevelt Roads, where she arrived on 6 October to load ammunition, to take on fuel, and to embark a Coast Guard law enforcement detachment along with Commander, Caribbean Squadron and his staff. The ship operated in her assigned waters from 6 October to 19 October, returning to Roosevelt Roads to debark Commander, Caribbean Squadron and his staff. Detaching the Coast Guardsmen at Nassau, Bahamas, on 22 October at the commencement of the ship's port visit there, Arthur W. Radford sailed for Norfolk on 25 October, arriving two days later. As before, her stay in port proved brief, for she got underway on 3 November for the Bermuda operating area for exercises. One day out of Norfolk, she assisted in searching for a crewman who had been lost in the Cape Hatteras area. Arthur W. Radford conducted her exercises, SHAREM 1-87, before returning to Norfolk on 16 November. With the exception of a period underway in the Virginia Capes operating area on 9 and 10 December, Arthur W. Radford spent the month of December in port in Norfolk. In early 1987, the ship participated in a major FLEETEX and other exercises, and from 20 July to 10 December 1987, the ship took part in UNITAS XXVIII. Arthur W. Radford fires a Harpoon missile during operation Red Reef III, 1992. A vertical launching system (VLS) was installed in January 1990 during a major overhaul at Avondale Shipyard. On 26 September 1991, the ship departed for a six-month deployment to the Persian Gulf with the battle group, returning 26 March 1992. It was her first deployment in five years. The ship deployed to the Mediterranean sea in 1994 and in 1996. The ship and crew received awards for service relating to Bosnia during both deployments.  Later career and collision  Arthur W. Radford replenishes from (CVN-73) in the Mediterranean in 1996. As of 31 August 1995, Arthur W. Radford was to become part of Destroyer Squadron 26. In May 1997, Arthur W. Radford received the first shipboard installation of the Advanced Enclosed Mast/Sensor System which fully integrates advanced materials, structures, and manufacturing technologies with sensor technology, electromagnetics, and signature reduction to achieve improved warfighting capabilities. On 4 February 1999 at about 23:34, Arthur W. Radford collided with the Saudi Riyadh, () a 29,259-ton, -long, roll-on/roll-off container ship, which was preparing to enter the Chesapeake Bay bound for Baltimore. According to the Navy, Arthur W. Radford was conducting calibration tests on electronic warfare equipment at the time of the collision. As a part of that test, the ship had been sailing in circles around an electronic buoy for six hours prior to the collision. Saudi Riyadh, meanwhile, was approaching the Chesapeake Bay from the northeast, preparing to line up in the shipping lanes before taking on a marine pilot for its eventual trip to Baltimore. When the two ships collided, Saudi Riyadhs bow struck the starboard side of Arthur W. Radford, about behind its bow. Saudi Riyadh sustained a four-foot-high, -long gash along the port and starboard sides of its bow, with most of the damage to its port side. Arthur W. Radford, more heavily damaged, sustained a deep gash on its starboard side, penetrating nearly into the main deck, ripping a pie-shaped gash and penetrating into the centerline of Arthur W. Radford. A hole ran from the deck to the waterline. The collision toppled its 5-inch 54-caliber gun and damaged Tomahawk cruise missile tubes. One sailor aboard suffered a broken arm, and 12 more had various injuries. The ship entered Norfolk Naval Shipyard Drydock #3 25 February 1999. Arthur W. Radford returning to duty following collision repairs, September 1999. Arthur W. Radford sustained an estimated $32.7 million in damages and the damage prevented the ship from leaving 26 March on a scheduled six-month deployment to the Mediterranean Sea with the carrier battle group. Repairs aboard Arthur W. Radford were completed on 13 September and the destroyer then deployed with the battle group. As a result of the collision, the commanding officer was relieved 13 February 1999. In June 2000, a US court affixed liability at 65% Saudi Riyadh / 35% Arthur W. Radford. Neither the US Navy commanding officer nor the cargo ship's master were on the bridge or consulted prior to the collision. Arthur W. Radford deployed to the Mediterranean Sea and Persian Gulf 3 April to 1 October 2000.  Fate  Arthur W. Radford was decommissioned 18 March 2003, then stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 6 April 2004 and eventually assigned to the Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On 8 June 2010, the ex-Arthur W. Radford was transferred to the State of Delaware for preparation for eventual sinking as an artificial reef onto the Del-Jersey- Land Inshore Reef site on a project lead by Captain Tim Mullane of The American Marine Group (), about southeast of Cape May, New Jersey, and northeast of Ocean City, Maryland. After being scuttled on 10 August 2011, the ship became part of the largest artificial reef on the east coast and the longest vessel to be used for this purpose in the Atlantic.

Marching refers to the organized, uniformed, steady walking forward in either rhythmic or route-step time; and, typically, it refers to overland movements on foot of military troops and units under field orders. It is a major part of military basic training in most countries and usually involves a system of drill commands. A soldier learning to march to drum cadences, martial music and shouted commands is considered an essential element of teaching military discipline. Marching is often performed to march music and is typically associated with military and civilian ceremonial parades. For rhythmic marching, individuals must maintain their dress, cover, interval, and distance (DCID): * dress ‚Äî alignment with the person to the side; * cover ‚Äî alignment with the person in front; * interval ‚Äî space between the person(s) to the side; * distance ‚Äî space between the person in front. In Northern Ireland, for some people, marching is a major provocative ritual. Hundreds of marches occur annually. These are usually organized by groups such as the Orange Order, which provide most of the participants. Music is provided by marching bands including silver bands, flute bands and others. Marching is often seen as a symbol of control over a particular area, and marching is often seen as a sectarian activity. The Royal Marines refer to a long distance march carrying full kit as a yomp. The most famous yomp of recent times was during the 1982 Falklands War. Military paces In the military venue there are various rhythmic military steps or standard paces. One step occurs on each beat. A pace is the length of one step, assumed to be 75 cm or 30\\"; (not to be confused with the ancient Roman unit of length (2 steps or 5 Roman feet = 148 cm or 58\\")). * Quick March: The basic mobility. 120 beats/min. In the US this is called \\"quick time\\". * Double March: The basic run. 180 beats/min. In the US this is called \\"double time\\". * Highland March: Regiment-specific pace, 80 beats/min. when wearing kilts. * Rifles March: Regiment-specific pace, 140-beats/min. Like double-time, this is a rapid trot, with the rifle usually carried at the trail, not on the shoulder. * Slow March: Ceremonial pace, 60 beats/min. * Parade March: Usually seen combined with music, 116AP818, RAF Drill and Ceremonialhttps://learning.bader.mod.uk/Global/AP818%20Drill%20and%20Ceremonial/20061003%20-%20AP%20818%20-%20u.pdf beats/min. in the UK (except the Rifles who march at 140bpm), ~120 beats/min. in the US and Russia * French Foreign Legion Pace: 88 beats/min * Paso Legionario: Specific march used by the Spanish Legion, 144 beats/min, embodiment of their \\"esp√≠ritu de marcha\\". * Typical German speed is 112 bpm. For mechanical efficiency, opposite arms usually swing with each leg while marching. British and Commonwealth armed forces keep their arms straight and swing the hand as high as the shoulder while forward and in theory to the level of the belt when backward. US Marines swing the arm six inches to the front and three inches to the rear whileMARINE CORPS ORDER P5060.20 US Army Soldiers swing the arm nine inches to the front and six inches to the rear.FM 3-21.5 Some European armies bend the arm during the swing. Most foot drill instructors believe these differing practices are efficient i.e. maintain rhythm for long route marches. US troops usually march long distances at \\"route step\\" which does not require them to maintain a specific pace or length of step. Some South American and Eastern European countries march on parade with the stiff leg earlier famous as the \\"goose step\\" of German troops. German and Scandinavian military bands and units swing with only the right arm, 90 degrees straight out. Some troops (like the Royal Swedish Lifeguard) swing with their left arm. This is because they carry their rifle in their right arm.

In August 1979 Soviet planes staged a mock missile attack against the Caron in the Black Sea. In late October, 1983 the Caron participated in Operation Urgent Fury in the vicinity of Grenada. Near H-hour on D-Day, Oct. 25, 1983, the Caron recovered a 20-man Navy SEAL/Air Force reconnaissance team from waters off the island's southwest coast. The recon team had sortied from the USS Clifton Sprague to assess the condition of a 9,000-foot runway then under construction by Cuban workers at Point Salines. Heavy swells swamped the engines of the team's small boats before they could reach shore. The Caron spotted them drifting offshore as dawn approached. Much later that day, the Caron recovered 10 more SEALs from the waters northwest of the island's capital after another commando team was driven off a radio transmitter site by a Grenadian counter- attack. The next afternoon, the Caron made yet a third recovery. The destroyer took aboard 11 Army Rangers on a raft who had been left behind on Grand Anse Beach following the successful helicopter rescue of 233 medical students and staff from St. George's University School of Medicine‚Äôs beachfront campus. From November 1983 to March 1984 Caron was part of the Multi National Peacekeeping Force in Beirut, Lebanon. On 10 March 1986, Caron departed Norfolk, Virginia with the carrier battle group, for a Mediterranean deployment. During this deployment, the Action in the Gulf of Sidra took place during a freedom of navigation exercise in the Gulf of Sidra. This action saw U.S. Navy fighter aircraft shoot two Libyan Air Force fighters down. On 23 March 1986, operating with and , Caron moved south of the Libya-claimed \\"Line of Death\\". Libya reacted with two days of low intensity conflict in which Caron did not fire any weapons.

Caron was deployed to the Middle East after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, and from 14 January 1991 she participated in Operation Desert Storm. On 14 October 1993 she began participation in United Nations-mandated, U.S.-executed sanctions enforcement operations against Haiti. She was one of six US Navy ships prepositioned off Haiti as a result of an order by President Bill Clinton.* united-states-navy.com: USS Caron, accessed January 2011 Clinton's order allowed the ships to be in position to enforce United Nations sanctions fully on the date at which they went into effect. In April 1995 Caron took part in a NATO mine countermeasures exercise off Denmark. From January to July 1996 she deployed to the Persian Gulf upholding United Nations sanctions against Iraq and aiding in Operation Southern Watch. From February to 3 July 1998 she deployed to the Mediterranean and Persian Gulf, operating with and Carrier Group Seven. During this deployment, Helicopter Antisubmarine Squadron Light 46 (HSL-46) Detachment 3 maintained 2 SH-60B Seahawk onboard Caron. One of the first exercises during this deployment was Exercise Shark Hunt 98 in April 1998 off the coast of Spain. From January to 4 June 1999 she completed a regular overhaul at Newport News Shipbuilding. This overhaul included modifications to accommodate female crew. In June to December 2000 she deployed to the Mediterranean Sea and Persian Gulf, operating with the battle group. On 15 October 2001 the ship was decommissioned. On 4 December 2002 Caron was sunk prematurely off the coast of Puerto Rico as a result of explosives tests. USS Caron sinking off Puerto Rico = Incidents in Soviet waters = On 13 March 1986, in an unprecedented move, Caron and entered Soviet territorial waters to the south of the Crimean Peninsula, which prompted a Soviet diplomatic protest. Administration officials claimed it was \\"simply an exercise of the right of innocent passage\\", although Pentagon officials readily confirmed that one purpose of the exercise was to collect intelligence. In February 1988, Caron, again operating with , entered Soviet territorial waters limit in the Black Sea off the Crimean Peninsula. Under international law, this act could be permissible if the ship was progressing from one point in international waters to another point in international waters via the shortest course possible, but according to the Soviet Union, it was the right of the USSR to authorize or prohibit travel in selected areas within the 12 mile limit. The United States, however, did not recognize the Soviet claim in this case. To prevent the claim from becoming accepted precedent, the US Navy asserted that it had sailed warships through such areas at regular intervals in the past in accordance with established international law. In response, the Soviets deployed a frigate \\"Bezzavetnyy\\" (rus.: \\"–ë–µ–∑–∑–∞–≤–µ—Ç–Ω—ã–π\\", Burevestnik M-class frigate) and a SKR-6 (rus.: C–ö–†-6) Mirka II class light frigate as well as many other Soviet Navy, Coast Guard, KGB and \\"civilian\\" ships to intercept the U.S. ships. Soviet aircraft continuously buzzed the Caron and Yorktown as smaller vessels weaved to and fro in front of the American ships. Several times, Soviet vessels and aircraft obtained radar \\"lock\\" on the Caron and Yorktown. Both American ships maintained a constant course and speed throughout the incident. Eventually, the Soviets lightly rammed both ships. No significant damage resulted to any of the ships involved.  Ship's crest  The design of the shield and crest of the coat of arms is based on service of Wayne Maurice Caron, Hospital Corpsman Third Class, United States Navy, who heroically sacrificed his life on 28 July 1968 while aiding wounded Marines on the field of fire in Vietnam. The Medal of Honor was awarded him posthumously. Caron is named in his honor. The light blue center section and the white five-pointed star allude to the Medal of Honor ribbon; the star is also inverted in reference to the silhouette of the Medal of Honor pendant. The one light blue and the two Navy blue sections refer to the courage, steadfast determination and selfless dedication of Petty Officer Caron in performance of duty while serving as Platoon Corpsman with Company K, Third Battalion, Seventh Marines, 1st Marine Division. The sweep of his unit through an open rice field in Qu·∫£ng Nam Province is indicated by the scarlet base and the embattled gold chevron. Navy blue and gold and scarlet and gold are the colors of the Navy and Marine Corps. The Navy-blue caduceus is the insignia worn on white uniforms by Hospital Corpsmen, United States Navy. This insignia and the crossed bayonets (in the colors of the Marine Corps) allude to the medical services customarily provided to the Marine Corps by the Navy. In particular, the caduceus and bayonets symbolize the combat operation in which Petty Officer Caron, though grievously wounded, was killed while giving medical assistance to his wounded comrades.

The ship's quick response and control of the elements of the Surface Action Group averted a potentially disastrous oil spill. The ship and her crew earned the Coast Guard Unit Commendation with Operational Device for its participation in this effort. On 16 April 1999 the David R. Ray deployed to the Persian Gulf on PACMEF 99-2 as the Surface Action Group Commander. The ship and crew conducted 55 boardings and over 850 hours of flight operations. David R. Ray was again in the news when her crew helped to delivery a healthy baby girl on aboard an Iraqi ferry. The ship returned to its homeport on 4 October 1999. Since returning from deployment, David R. Ray participated in various training opportunities, including Anti-Air Warfare and Naval Surface Fire Support exercises. Prior to the ship's change of command on 29 April 2000, David R. Ray visited Puerto Vallarta and escorted the ex-USS South Carolina (CGN-37) as she was towed to Bremerton, Washington, for deactivation and nuclear-powered vessel recycling. In May 2001 the \\"David R.

Ship's crest  The coat of arms of David R. Ray serves as a heraldic reminder of the ship's namesake. The light blue center section and white inverted star allude to the Medal of Honor pendant. The light blue and two Navy blue stripes represent the courage, perseverance and selfless devotion of Petty Officer Ray in the performance of his duties as corpsman with Battery D, Second Battalion, Eleventh Marine Regiment, First Marine Division (Reinforced), Fleet Marine Force, in South Vietnam. The battery's position is indicated by the scarlet and gold embattled border.http://www.navysite.de/dd/dd971.htm Navy blue, gold and scarlet are the colors of the Navy and Marine Corps. The navy blue caduceus is the insignia worn by hospital corpsmen in the U.S. Navy. The artillery howitzer cartridges allude to the medical services the Navy provides to Marine Corps artillery units, in particular, the action in which Petty Officer Ray, though fatally wounded, gave medical assistance and protection to wounded Marine comrades. The ship's motto, \\"Determined, Ready, Resourceful\\" alludes to the initials of Petty Officer Ray and epitomizes his legacy to the ship that bears his name. The motto served as a guide and inspiration for the men and women who served on the David R.

They were created in an attempt to live up to the postulate of Leninism about the rights of nations for self- determination. Also, creation of these regions served one of purposes of the Bolsheviks to export the revolution since after their defeat in the Polish- Soviet War, the Soviets did not give up their idea of creating a Soviet Republic in Poland. Polish National Districts were supposed to be the origin of future Soviet Poland,Jerzy Waszkiewicz, Polish autonomy in the Soviet ethnic policy system (in Polish) but they both were disbanded in mid-1930s and their populations expelled to Kazakhstan, with many of them killed during the Great Purge. Origins The possibility of granting autonomy to Polish- populated areas of the Soviet Union was discussed during the Polish-Soviet war by key persons involved in the Provisional Polish Revolutionary Committee. However, there were no plans to create whole districts; autonomy would be granted to separate villages. In 1925 it was decided that a district would be created in Soviet Ukraine, where, according to the 1926 survey, 476,435 Poles lived. This was 1.6% of the Ukrainian population, but in the Zhitomir Oblast, their number reached 10%. Among persons who supported the district were Soviet communists of Polish origin, such as Feliks Kon, Julian Marchlewski, Felix Dzerzhinsky and Tomasz DƒÖbal. Thus Marchlewszczyzna was created, and later Dzier≈ºy≈Ñszczyzna.

Dovbysh community. 7 July 2018 The district was one of 32 other national districts that were created in the Ukrainian SSR during that period (1924-1939). Creation of the district was based on standards adopted by the 4th session of the All-Ukrainian Central Executive Committee (15-19 February 1925) and recommendations of Central Commission in affairs of National Minorities at that executive committee. It was created to implement an idea in creation of Polish national districts on territories of Ukrainian and Belarusian SSRs. The district was located far away from railroad in which numerically dominated settlements of khutir type (farmsteads). Village Dovbysh was a small settlement around porcelain factory. The district did not have telephone and telegraph communications and by general estimates it was economically backwards. At the beginning stage the district was composed of 26 rural communities (so called selsoviet) with general area of 620 km2. Later 108 populated places were united into 34 communities (30 Polish, 2 Ukrainian, 2 German). In percentage relation the population consisted of 68.8% of Polish people, 19.2% of Ukrainians, 8.8% of Germans, 2.5% of Jews, 0.5% of Russians. In 1932 the number of communities increased to 38 with 34 being Polish. Official opening ceremony of the district took place on 27 March 1926 with participation of Felix Dzerzhinsky, Feliks Kon, Samuil Lazovert, Boleslav Skarbek, J√≥zef Unszlicht at the First district congress of Soviets (27-30 April 1926) where in total took part 103 delegates and 500 visitors. The newly created district received valuable presents: from Moscow Factory \\"Tribuna\\" were 2 tractors with ploughs, from \\"Pratsia\\" association ‚Äì radio receivers, from Polish department of the People's Commissariat of Enlightenment of the Ukrainian SSR ‚Äì otoscopes. In 1927 took place the Second congress of Soviets of Marchlewski District at which were present Tomasz DƒÖbal, Samuil Lazovert, Boleslav Skarbek. During celebration of the 10th Anniversary of 1917 October Revolution the Polish District was visited by Polish delegation. As a type of Soviet propaganda, the subdivision was located just from the eastern border of the Second Polish Republic and was named after the Polish Bolshevik Julian Marchlewski, who was a rector of the Communist University of the National Minorities of the West and dreamed of Poland becoming part of the Soviet Union. The Marchlewszczyzna had to become an exemplary autonomous district where Bolsheviks sought to demonstrate to their western neighbor Poland that Polish as nation also will submit to \\"government of workers and peasants\\".Marchlewszczyzna, Polish autonomous district (–ú–∞—Ä—Ö–ª–µ–≤—â–∏–Ω–∞ ‚Äì –ø–æ–ª—å—Å—å–∫–∏–π –∞–≤—Ç–æ–Ω–æ–º–Ω–∏–π —Ä–∞–π–æ–Ω). Studentskyi polskyi klub. 19 November 2015 Function of the Polish District had boldly expressed political composition. About that more than once had spoken the leader of Polish section of the Central Commission in affairs of National Minorities Jan Saulewicz. The raion was established out of the already existing Pulyny Raion. Later in 1930 the rest of Pulyny Raion was transformed into German National District. Soon after the establishment of Marchlewski Polish National District, territorial division by governorates in the Ukrainian SSR was abolished and Marchlewszczyzna became part at first of Zhytomyr Okruha and after establishing of Kiev Oblast in 1932 part of Novohrad Volynskyi Okruha. In the initial years of the district's existence, local Poles enjoyed limited autonomy, with 55 Polish-language schools, 80 reading rooms and a Polish daily Marchlewszczyzna Radziecka (Soviet Marchlewszczyzna). At the same time, its inhabitants were subject to intense communist propaganda. Polish grammar rules, regarded as bourgeoisie, were changed; however, the district lacked educated people. The majority of its inhabitants were Catholic peasants who were not interested in communist ideas. Therefore, such persons as Tomasz DƒÖbal were brought there to propagate atheism. An organization named the Polish Anti-Catholic Section was also founded. As one of Dovbysh residents recall, after local elections some newly elected officials were soon arrested and taken away in \\"Chornyi voronok\\" (a special NKVD car that was used to carry detained).Kabachiy, Roman. Polish in Polissia. The Ukrainian Week. 29 May 2009 Among such was father of Halyna (Helena) Trybel, Jan Trybel who spent in exile 20 years. Halyna Trybel happened to be a mother of Yuriy Yekhanurov. Soviet authorities, who wanted to create Polish laborers, future citizens of the Polish Soviet Republic, built several factories as well as power plants and telephone lines. This also brought about improvement in the quality of life, but all efforts were destroyed in the early 1930s, when collectivization began (see collectivization in the Soviet Union). Polish peasants opposed it fiercely, and thousands of them perished in the Holodomor (Enforced famine). Initially, ethnic Poles constituted around 70% of district's population, which in 1926 totalled around 41,000. Other inhabitants were Ukrainians (20%), Germans (7%) and Jews. In 1930, after several adjacent villages were added to Marchlewszczyzna, the population grew to 52,000, with Poles still constituting 70%. It has been estimated that the district consisted of around 100 villages, settlements and smaller towns. In 1935 on resolution of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union (signed by Grigoriy Petrovskiy) the Polish national raion was abolished and split between newly formed Chervonoarmiyskyi Raion and Baranivka Raion, Kiev Oblast, while some communities were also transferred to either Novohrad-Volynskyi or Zhytomyr municipalities. In Zhytomyr Oblast former Marchlewszczyzna appeared upon creation of the oblast in 1938. Soon after dissolution of the Soviet Union, since 1996 in local town school Polish language is being taught once again on efforts of the local Polish Society of Jan Paul II. Already in 1990 in Dovbysh was revived local Catholic parish.  Dzier≈ºy≈Ñszczyzna  Felix Dzerzhinsky Dzier≈ºy≈Ñszczyzna was a Polish National District (–î–∑–µ—Ä–∂–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π –ø–æ–ª—å—Å–∫–∏–π –Ω–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π —Ä–∞–π–æ–Ω, Dzierzhynsky Polish national district) in Belarus, near Minsk and close to the Soviet-Polish border of the time.

Similarly to Marchlewszczyzna, limited Polish autonomy in the area was a real fact, with Polish-language schools, libraries and institutions. At the same time, the inhabitants were subject to intensive communist propaganda. Religious life was suppressed, and the campaign of collectivization, carried out in mid-1930s, met resistance of local Polish peasants. Unlike Marchlewszczyzna, which was the real center of Polish cultural life in the Soviet Union, Dzier≈ºy≈Ñszczyzna's influence was limited.  Disbanding  Polish districts were among those which resisted Soviet collectivization and atheization. For political reasons, drastic measures were initially not applied in these areas. Eventually, Marchlewszczyzna was disbanded in 1935 at the onset of the Great Purge and most of the administration was executed. In the following years, many men were shot (111,091 according to NKVD 00485 Order, women and children deported to Kazakhstan and other remote areas of the Soviet Union. Dzier≈ºy≈Ñszczyzna was disbanded in 1937. All Polish schools and libraries were closed, Tomasz DƒÖbal was executed in 1938. After World War II, in both Polish and Soviet historiographies, the existence of the districts was omitted, perhaps because the authorities of both countries wanted to avoid uneasy questions about sudden rejection of the Leninist postulate of the rights of nations for self- determination. The area of Marchlewszczyzna is still inhabited by the Polish minority, in the town of Dovbysh they make half of the population. There are also Poles in Dzier≈ºy≈Ñszczyzna.

Oldendorf USN, was a built by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Division of Litton Industries at Pascagoula, Mississippi. Construction Oldendorf was the tenth Spruance- class destroyer and the first ship in the Navy named after Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf, one of the most distinguished surface warfare flag officers to serve during World War II. She was built by Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi beginning 27 December 1974. Was Launched on 21 October 1975 and was commissioned on 4 March 1978. Ship's history Oldendorf in Seattle c.1983. Oldendorf was originally stationed in San Diego, California, although the ship's first year was marked by shipyard work in Long Beach, California and another visit to Litton Shipbuilders in Pascagoula, Mississippi. This schedule meant three Panama Canal transits for most of the ship's pre-commissioning crew within the a ship's first 12 months of service. During her first Westpac deployment which took place between May to November 1980 Oldendorf took part in a joint Australian-American-New Zealand anti- submarine exercise off the Western Australian coast during August 1980, which saw the destroyer conduct visits to the Western Australian town of Bunbury and the city of Perth. Oldendorf conducted her second Westpac deployment, this time with the aircraft carrier and her Carrier Battle Group in October 1981 to the Persian Gulf, during which Oldendorf returned to visit the Western Australian city of Perth. She returned home in May 1982 before undergoing an overhaul from September 1982 to July 1983, then conducted work ups for the ship's third Westpac deployment which took place from January to May 1984. Oldendorf was re-based to Yokosuka, Japan as part of the United States Seventh Fleet in August 1984. She was a member of the battle group until being transferred to San Diego in 1991. During her time in the 7th Fleet she was involved with numerous events including regular exercises with all major navies in the area. In November 1986, along with and , she visited the port of Quingdao, China, the first group of US warships to visit mainland China since 1949. In 1988 Oldendorf deployed as part of the Seoul Olympics security force with the battle group for which she received the Meritorious Unit Citation. During two separate deployments Oldendorf was responsible for rescuing Vietnamese refugees fleeing governmental oppression and during mid-1989 Oldendorf was the first warship to be granted access to the small Australian village of Gove since 1975, when a seafaring naval tug was last to visit. Oldendorf had received approval from the Aboriginal tribe leaders to make a port of call there as a sign of good will to the US Navy. She received numerous awards for achievement and excellence. The commanding officer during her deployment to the Gulf War was Commander Cyrus H Butt IV. Oldendorf was part of the first United States response to the invasion of Kuwait in 1990. She served with distinction throughout the war earning the Combat Action Ribbon escorting the various major warships and supporting the naval blockade of Iraq. She returned to Japan in mid-1991. The summer of 1991 had the ship change its homeport to Long Beach, California for a year and a half long overhaul in the Long Beach Naval Shipyards. In late 1993 the command was shifted to her final homeport of San Diego. In early 1993 she participated in LEO operations off the South American coast returning in March 1993. Oldendorf took part in the surface exercise Eager Sentry, as part of the larger Exercise Native Fury '94. Involving Kuwaiti and British military members, it was the largest naval exercise ever conducted in Kuwait. It was conducted from 4 April through 25 April, to demonstrates U.S. resolve to support the peace in the Persian Gulf region after ousting Iraq from Kuwait three years prior. Native Fury comprised several exercises under one umbrella. In the namesake exercises, two Maritime Prepositioning Ships sailed from their homeport of Diego Garcia and discharged more than 1,000 tanks, artillery pieces and vehicles at the port of Shuaibah, starting 5 April. Approximately 2,000 marines and sailors from I Marine Expeditionary Force, 7th Marine Regiment, 1st Force Service Support Group and Naval Beach Group One arrived by air, off- loaded and convoyed the equipment to a training range north of Kuwait City. There, they trained with the Kuwaiti Army and British Royal Marines, perfecting tactics which would delay, and perhaps turn back, any repeat of the invasion of Kuwait. Other elements of Native Fury involved the surface exercise Eager Sentry; Eager Archer, an aerial exercise; and Eager Express with explosive ordnance disposal units training on the southern Kuwaiti beaches. Oldendorf aerial view As part of a reorganization by the Pacific Fleet's surface ships into six core battle groups and eight destroyer squadrons, with the reorganization scheduled to be completed by 1 October 1995, and homeport changes to be completed within the following, year, Oldendorf was reassigned to Destroyer Squadron 23. Oldendorf departed on 1 December 1995, as part of the Battle Group, for a regularly scheduled Western Pacific deployment. In March 1996, and in response to the announcement of missile tests and military live-fire exercises to be conducted by the Chinese in the waters surrounding the island of Taiwan, the United States dispatched forward deployed naval assets, including a carrier and other combatants to the area to monitor the situation. and other units in its battle group, operating in international waters, were on the scene from the beginning of the exercises. However, to augment the monitoring efforts, and further demonstrate U.S. commitment to peace and stability in the region, Nimitz and elements of its battle group, including Oldendorf, were ordered to sail from the Persian Gulf to the Western Pacific earlier than planned, after two months in the Persian Gulf for Operation Southern Watch. Oldendorf underway c.1984. Oldendorf took part, from 13 April through 24 April in Pacific Joint Task Force Exercise 98-1 (PAC JTFEX 98-1) off the Southern California coast. The aim of the exercise was to prepare naval forces to participate in joint operations with other U.S. forces. Naval operations included Maritime Interception Operations (MIO), Non-Combatant Evacuation Operations (NEO), various air strike and support missions, operational testing of various weapons systems, Theater Ballistic Missile Defense (TBMD), logistics support, search and rescue, and command and control. An amphibious landing at Camp Pendleton, California, on 21 April, involved Navy surface and helicopter assault forces, U.S. Air Force aircraft, as well as units from Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom. Oldendorf deployed on 9 November 1998, for a six-month overseas assignment, as part of the battle group. Joining Carl Vinson was the Amphibious Ready Group (ARG). The Carl Vinson battle group and the Boxer ARG were to relieve the battle group and the ARG, which had been forward deployed for the previous five months to the Western Pacific, Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf. Oldendorf arrived on station in the Persian Gulf with the Carl Vinson battle group and took part in Operation Desert Fox in December 1998. The operation was designed to degrade Saddam Hussein's ability to deliver chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, and wage war against his neighbors. It also took part in Operation Southern Watch. The Carl Vinson battle group, led by Carl Vinson and Carrier Air Wing (CVW) Eleven departed the Persian Gulf on 18 March 1999, after spending three intense months supporting Operations Southern Watch and Desert Fox in Southern Iraq. The ships returned home in May. As of early 2000, developmental tests were in progress on Oldendorf as part of the SPQ-9B Radar Improvement Program. The program aimed at using COTS systems and NDI to improve the performance of the AN/SPQ-9 Radar in the Mk 86 Gun Fire Control System (GFCS), which would be integrated into the Mk 1 Ship Self-Defense System. In August 2000, Oldendorf was directed to the scene of a crash into the Persian Gulf, on 23 August, by a commercial passenger jet, in order to assist in the recovery of the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder. The jet, a twin-engine Airbus A320 operated by Gulf Air which originated in Cairo, plunged into shallow water about 3 to 4 miles north of Bahrain International Airport while making its approach. Oldendorf was relieved of this duty by , which was much closer to the proximity of the site of the crash. The bodies of all 143 people aboard the aircraft were recovered. Oldendorf took part in the first Joint Task Force Exercise (JTFEX) of 2001 during the month of February. Together with the Special Operations Capable certification (SOCCERT), the JTFEX aimed at providing progressive and realistic pre-deployment training for a carrier battle group, an amphibious ready group, a Marine Expeditionary Unit and other deployers. The name Joint Task Force Exercise reflects the focus on preparing naval forces to participate fully in joint operations with other U.S. forces and the armed forces of allied countries. Naval operations included Maritime Interdiction Operations (MIO), Non-Combatant Evacuation Operations (NEO), various air strike and support missions, operational testing of various weapons systems, Theater Ballistic Missile Defense (TBMD), logistics support, search and rescue and command and control. U.S. Navy and Marine Corps forces were joined in the exercise by U.S. Air Force aircraft as well as units from Canada. Sea swap The U.S. Navy Surface Force was scheduled to begin, in the summer of 2002, an initiative to test the effectiveness of deploying a single ship for 18 months while swapping out crews at six-month intervals. Called Sea Swap, this initial two-phased initiative would involve three Spruance-class destroyers (DDs) ‚Äì , and Oldendorf, and three Arleigh Burke- destroyers (DDGs) ‚Äì , and . For the DD phase, Fletcher and her crew would deploy with their battle group this summer, but after six months, only the crew would return. The ship would remain deployed and be manned by the crew from Kinkaid. After completing their training cycle and decommissioning Kinkaid, these sailors would fly to a port in either Australia or Singapore to assume ownership of Fletcher and steam her back on-station. After six months, they would be replaced by the crew from Oldendorf who would have completed the same training and decommissioning schedule with their ship before flying out to relieve the Kinkaid crew. After four more months on station, the Oldendorf crew would then bring Fletcher back to the United States where it too would be decommissioned. Additionally, by executing this plan, the Navy would be able to eliminate the deployment of because the additional on-station time generated by swapping out the crews meant a ship would already be in theater meeting that requirement. Fate Oldendorf was decommissioned 20 June 2003 and berthed at Bremerton, Washington NISMF. She was stricken 6 April 2004.

The shield commemorates Admiral Oldendorf's crossing of the \\"T\\" in the epic sea Battle of Surigao Strait during World War II, which resulted in a brilliant and decisive victory for the United States. The vertical blue bar, alluding to a narrow passage or waterway, refers to Surigao Strait, and the eight red and white sections of the background represents the total losses of the enemy in terms of the number of ships sunk, damaged or crippled. The blue chief at the top crossing of the \\"T\\" battle plan, with upper section simulating red sky over the night battle of Surigao Strait. The four stars denote Admiral Oldendorf's highest rank. The crest symbolizes the award of the Navy Cross, The Navy's highest decoration, awarded to Admiral Oldendorf for exceptional leadership and heroism in the Battle of Surigao Strait. The trident signifies authority and power and the annulet with red center suggest the muzzle of a gun in action. The two wavy bars are indicative of World War II and the Pacific area. The ship's motto, \\"Ad Proelium Victoriamque Futuram\\" (To the Fight and Victory Ahead) is the Latin translation of a line taken from Admiral Oldendorf's memoirs regarding his charge to his forces on the eve of the decisive Battle of Surigao Strait.

Early life and education Born in 1946 at Egerton, Nova Scotia, Cameron graduated from McGill University with a Bachelor of Science degree. Political career Cameron entered provincial politics in the 1974 election, defeating Liberal Lester MacLellan by 272 votes in the Pictou East riding. He was re-elected in the 1978 election by almost 2,000 votes. On October 5, 1978, Cameron was appointed to the Executive Council of Nova Scotia as Minister of Fisheries and Minister of Recreation. He resigned from cabinet on June 25, 1980. He was re-elected in the 1981 and 1984 elections. On April 20, 1988, Cameron was reappointed to cabinet as Minister of Industry, Trade and Technology. Cameron was re-elected in the 1988 election, defeating Liberal Wayne Fraser by 753 votes. In September 1990, John Buchanan resigned as premier, and a leadership convention was scheduled for February 1991. On November 2, 1990, Cameron announced his candidacy for the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party of Nova Scotia. At the leadership convention, on February 9, 1991, Cameron led through the first two ballots and defeated Roland J. Thornhill by 143 votes on the third ballot to win the leadership. He was sworn-in as the 22nd Premier of Nova Scotia on February 26. =Premier of Nova Scotia= Cameron's administration was known for a smaller cabinet, supporting anti-discrimination measures, and amending the human rights act to extend protection to gays and lesbians. His government also privatized Nova Scotia Power Incorporated, the largest privatization move in Canada at the time. Cameron also introduced merit-based hiring codes, signed on to the Atlantic Procurement Agreement and introduced mandatory testing in grades 3, 6, 9 and 12 with public release of test scores. Cameron's government established a nonpartisan electoral boundaries revision commission in an attempt to end gerrymandering. Cameron began the practice of non- political appointment of judges, deregulation of gasoline prices and made investments in double-stack rail service from the Port of Halifax (benefitting the TrentonWorks rail car plant in his riding) as well as four-lane highways. His efforts in ending party patronage marked a change in politics in Nova Scotia that his successors, John Savage, and John Hamm were able to continue, making appointments more transparent. Cameron is also remembered as an aggressive supporter of a disastrous development project. He was instrumental, first as a local MLA, then as industry minister in the government of John Buchanan, and then as premier, in the development of the Westray Mine in Pictou County, Nova Scotia. Concerns, expressed by many, appeared in the provincial media regarding the safety of those working in such a mine. While coal mining typically releases explosive methane gas, the location of the mine was in an area of Pictou County that had an unusually-high level of methane. However, despite the opposition from federal bureaucrats, opposition politicians and a Government of Canada crown agency responsible for coal mining in Cape Breton, the Cape Breton Development Corporation (Devco), Westray Mine was developed through the late eighties and opened in 1991 with significant provincial and federal government assistance. On May 9, 1992 a methane gas explosion killed 26 miners. Cameron's government is also remembered for continuing the Buchanan policy in supporting development of the controversial Point Aconi Generating Station project. In the 1993 election, Cameron won personal re-election in his Pictou East riding, but his government was defeated in a landslide by the Nova Scotia Liberal Party under John Savage. On election night, Cameron announced his resignation as both party leader and MLA for Pictou East.

USS John Young (DD-973), named for Captain John Young, USN, was a of the United States Navy. The ship was built by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Division of Litton Industries at Pascagoula, Mississippi. History In 1987, John Young deployed off the coast of Iran in support of Operation Earnest Will and participated in Operation Nimble Archer. John Young deployed with Battle Group Echo, which included the aircraft carrier , battleship , cruisers , , destroyers and , frigates , , , and auxiliaries , , , . John Young, following appropriate Congressional notification, became one of eight combat ships that began receiving women as crewmembers in 1994. As part of a reorganization by the Pacific Fleet's surface ships into six core battle groups and eight destroyer squadrons, with the reorganization scheduled to be completed by 1 October 1995, and homeport changes to be completed within the following, year, John Young was reassigned to Destroyer Squadron 23. John Young departed San Diego on 9 February 1996 en route to the Persian Gulf for a six-month deployment as part of the Middle East Force (MEF). This deployment was remarkable because a main engineering space was completely gutted and refitted following a major fuel oil leak earlier in the week. On 28 April 1998, Navy and Coast Guard inspectors aboard John Young boarded a merchant ship thus marking the 10,000th such boarding in support of United Nations sanctions against Iraq. As part of a multinational maritime interception force, operating in the Persian Gulf, the team boarded an Indian flagged dhow in the Persian Gulf to make the milestone boarding. The vessel was empty and permitted to proceed. John Young departed San Diego on 18 November 1997 en route to the Persian Gulf for a six- month deployment as part of the Middle East Force (MEF). John Young teamed up with a Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment (LEDET) in late March 2001 for a major drug bust at sea.

Daucus has about 25 species. The oldest carrot fossil is 1.3 Ma, and was found in Madeira island (Atlantic ocean)  Description  Members of Daucus are distinguished within the family Apiaceae by their leaves which are 2‚Äì3 pinnatisect with narrow end sections. The genus primarily consists of biennial plants but also includes some annual plants and some perennial herbs. All Daucus have bristly stems. The inflorescences are umbels. The flowers are mostly white, with bracts and bracteoles. The petals may be pure white, reddish, pinkish or yellowish. They are emarginate above and have pointed, wrapped lobules. The petals are often unequal in size, with petals at the outermost edge of the inflorescence often being larger. The fruit is an ovoid to ellipsoidal schizocarp, cylindrical or compressed, with ciliate primary ribs and secondary ribs with a row of hooked spines. Some species have a small pale or white edible taproot, similar to a radish, which may or may not be bitter in taste. Ecology Daucus pollination is carried out by insects, primarily: Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Diptera, and Hymenoptera. It is a cosmopolitan genus with endemic species on most continents as well as on many islands and in isolated areas. The genus centre is in North Africa and Southwest Asia in the Temperate Zone. Prolonged dry or cold weather tends to retard growth in Daucus species, but the genus as a whole is evolutionarily adaptative to these conditions. Some Daucus species accumulate substantial resources in large underground taproots without impeding plant development. Native to Europe is the Carrot, with two subspecies: Wild Carrot and (subsp carota Daucus carota), a cultivated form of carrot, also called garden carrot. Four members of the Daucus genus were examined to determine differences in isoenzyme patterns and plastid DNA. The four were: Daucus carota subspecies sativus cultivar Danvers, D. carota subsp. gummifer, D. capillifolius, and D. pusillus. Although only one form of HSDH (homoserine dehydrogenase) was present in each Daucus line, the rate of migration of HSDH from cv. Danvers was different from that of the others. Multiple isoenzymic forms of ADH were present in each Daucus cultivar. Comparison of endonuclease restriction fragment patterns from plastid DNAs digested by BamHI revealed only small differences between plastid DNAs of cv. Danvers and subsp. gummifer, whereas large differences were observed between cv. Danvers and D. pusillus plastid DNA patterns. No differences were found between cv. Danvers and D. capillifolius plastid DNA patterns when examined using eight different restriction enzymes. The data indicate that specific isoenzyme and organelle DNA restriction fragment patterns will be useful markers for precise identification of genomes of different Daucus species.  Systematics  The genus comprises about 20 species divided into three sections.S√°enz Lain C. 1981. \\"Research on Daucus L (Apiaceae)\\". Anales Jardin Botanico De Madrid. 37: 481‚Äì533.

During her fifth deployment, O'Brien became part of the Middle East Force. O'Brien participated in Operation Earnest Will, escorting reflagged Kuwaiti tankers, and Operation Praying Mantis, during which O'Brien was a key member of the three-ship surface action group that engaged and sank the Iranian guided missile frigate . O'Brien underwent an extensive overhaul and received major weapon systems improvements in 1988 including the Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) for the Tomahawk cruise missile, the SQR-1 tactical towed array sonar system and the LAMPS MK III helicopter system. While assigned to the Middle East Force from September to December 1990, O'Brien participated in Operation Desert Shield. Conducting Persian Gulf patrols in support of the United Nations embargo of Iraq, O'Brien investigated over four hundred vessels. In December 1991 and again from February to April 1992, O'Brien conducted counter narcotic operations off the coasts of Central and South America. In August 1992, O'Brien departed San Diego to become a member of the Forward Deployed Naval Forces. En route from San Diego to Yokosuka, O'Brien conducted follow-on testing and evaluation of the vertically launched anti-submarine rocket and the SQQ-89 sonar system on the Pacific Missile Test Range off Kauai, Hawaii. O'Brien arrived in Yokosuka, Japan, in October 1992. In June 1993, O'Brien departed Yokosuka for her third deployment to the Middle East Force where she conducted Persian Gulf patrols in support of Operation Southern Watch and surveillance operations in the Gulf of Oman. O'Brien participated in several joint exercises with the U.S. Marines and Air Force, as well as combined exercises with the Armed Forces of Singapore, Brunei, and the Republic of Korea. O'Brien departed on her fourth Middle East Force deployment on 17 February 1995 and continued to conduct operations in support of the United Nations embargo on Iraq. O'Briens operational tempo remained very high throughout 1996, including her fifth Middle East Force Deployment, participating in the large naval exercise RIMPAC '96 as well as a member of the Taiwan contingency force. During Pacific Middle East Force (PACMEF), O'Brien continued conducting operations in support of the United Nations embargo on Iraq and her efforts resulted in the seizure of over 1.5 million gallons of contraband oil. O'Brien was away from homeport for 233 days in 1996, but was awarded with the Battle E Device, Meritorious Unit Commendation, Humanitarian Service Award and the nominated for the prestigious Spokane Trophy.

History William Nicoll, a son of New York City Mayor Matthias Nicoll, became a patentee in the 1680s of the east end of what is now the Town of Islip. He accumulated over and named his estate Islip, after the Nicolls' ancestral home in East Northamptonshire, England. His domain included what are now the hamlets of Islip, East Islip, Bayport, Sayville, West Sayville, Oakdale, Great River, Islip Terrace, Central Islip, Hauppauge, Holbrook, Bohemia, Brentwood, Holtsville, and a portion of Ronkonkoma. This land was purchased from Winnequaheagh, Sachem of Connetquot in 1683. The annual fee paid to Governor Thomas Dongan of New York was five bushels of good winter wheat or 25 shillings. The name \\"Islip\\" was chosen by local residents for their local post office when it opened in 1802. Islip was originally a farming community, gradually transforming into a posh enclave for wealthy families in the 19th and 20th centuries. Many of the Colonial Revival, Greek Revival, Romanesque Revival, Federal, Moorish and Victorian mansions that once lined the streets of Islip have been razed, though some remain, adjacent to many newer, large homes. Islip has a wealth of extant Queen Anne Revival homes. Located along the picturesque Great South Bay, Islip has a long history associated with fishing, clamming (the world-famous Doxsee Clam Company started in Islip), swimming and boating. Islip Hamlet has its own public bathing beach, under the jurisdiction of the town. Boating and yachting are as popular today as they were years ago, if not more so, with the development of the communities on the adjacent barrier beach of Fire Island. Main Street Islip Hamlet is known widely for its quaint shopping district along Main Street (NY 27A). There are gift shops, hairdressers, boutiques, restaurants, pubs, natural food stores and many other types of establishments.

Merill served as the US Navy's test platform for the Tomahawk cruise missile. In the 1980s, the destroyer took part in Operation Earnest Will in the Persian Gulf during heightened tensions with Iran. The destroyer was decommissioned in 1998. The vessel was used as a target ship in 2003 and sunk off Hawaii in 2003. Service history Merill was laid down on 16 June 1975 by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Division of Litton Industries at Pascagoula, Mississippi. She was launched on 1 September 1976 and commissioned on 11 March 1978. On 21 August 1980, while on a Western Pacific Ocean deployment, Merrill rescued 62 Vietnamese refugees, over southeast of Saigon. During the next years, Merrill served as the Navy's test platform for the Tomahawk Cruise Missile Program, earning the Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation. In this function, the ship did not participate in the Pacific Fleet's deployment rotation. In 1986, while serving as flagship for Destroyer Squadron 21 (COMDESRON 21), Merrill was deployed to the Western Pacific as part of Battle Group Romeo, which featured as its centerpiece the battleship , and as such became the first Battleship Battle Group to sail since aircraft carriers assumed that role during World War II. In 1989, Merrill stood out on a deployment to the Middle East. Serving as a unit of Joint Task Force Middle East, the ship conducted operations in support of Operation Earnest Will and was back in San Diego in May 1990. In August 1990 Merrill was host to the Soviet Navy in San Diego. Assigned to the carrier battle group, Merrill again deployed to the Middle East in 1991. On the way to Persian Gulf Merrill took part in Operation Fiery Vigil in June 1991. Arriving in the region after the ceasefire of the Gulf War, Merrill became the flagship for the coalition minesweeping forces in the Persian Gulf and was the second warship to visit the liberated port of Kuwait City after the Iraqi invasion. 1992 found Merrill underway on a counter-narcotics deployment in the Central America area of operations. In September 1992 Merrill was sent to Long Beach Naval Shipyard for an extensive overhaul which lasted into late 1993. This overhaul consisted of upgrades to the control panels of the radar systems, an entire level added to the ship to contain previously installed CIWS control computers, and most importantly, RAM (Radar Absorbent Material) was added to the entire ship, a first for a destroyer. Upon receiving notice of the planned closure of Long Beach, The USS Merrill relocated to San Diego Naval Base in 1994 and spent the next few months as a test platform in deployment for the RAM material, which was designed to make the ship appear as small as a tug boat on radars. Merrill deployed in 1995 as part of the Abraham Lincoln battle group. During the first half of the deployment, the battle group conducted a variety of multinational operations and exercises designed to support U.S. interests and relationships in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Persian Gulf. The battle group maintained a continuous watch on all merchant shipping going to and from Iraq. Numerous ships were queried and boarded to verify their cargo manifests. In July 1995, as part of a reorganization of the Pacific Fleet's surface ships into six core battle groups and eight destroyer squadrons, Merrill was reassigned to Destroyer Squadron 7. The reorganization was scheduled to be completed by 1 October, with homeport changes to be completed within the following year. From 10 February through 21 February 1997, Merrill took part in Pacific Joint Task Force Exercise (PACJTFEX) 97-1, off the Southern California coast. The U.S. 3rd Fleet exercise involved 20 ships, fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters from the carrier battle group and Amphibious Ready Group with the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit embarked. Army, Air Force, National Guard and Coast Guard units also participated. The exercise included various air strike and support missions, maritime interdiction operations, humanitarian operations, operational testing of weapons systems, logistics support, search and rescue, and command and control. Amphibious operations supporting the exercise culminated with an amphibious landing at Camp Pendleton, California, involving surface and helicopter assault forces. PAC JTFEX 97-1 was part of a series of exercises previously named \\"FLEETEX\\". The change in name reflected the increasing focus on preparing naval forces for joint operations with other U.S. military services. During the previous several years this exercise placed increasing emphasis on incorporating joint procedures, planning, and command and control structures into task group training. Merrill then deployed with the Constellation battle group, as part of a routine six-month deployment in the waters of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The Constellation battle group departed Fifth Fleet's Area of Responsibility (AOR) on 17 August 1997. The battle group had entered the Arabian Sea on 16 May, and conducted high tempo operations there that included more than 4,400 sorties during more than 10 weeks in the Persian Gulf. Operations included exercises with friendly forces in the region. After departing the Persian Gulf, the Constellation battle group concluded its tour in the 5th Fleet with a joint-combined exercise with the Pakistani Armed Forces. Dubbed Inspired Siren 97-2 and Inspired Alert 97-2, the exercises incorporated both surface combatants and air components, respectively. The purpose of this four-day training mission was to exercise the joint-combined naval and air capabilities of both countries, improve their respective levels of readiness and interoperability, and enhance military relations between the two nations. Fate Merrill was decommissioned and stricken 26 March 1998 awaiting disposal at Pearl Harbor Naval Intermediate Ship Maintenance Facility. On 1 August 2003 she was sunk as a target northwest of Hawaii. The wreckage is located at .

The comic is about a woman, Cathy, who struggles through the \\"four basic guilt groups\\" of life‚Äîfood, love, family, and work. The strip gently pokes fun at the lives and foibles of modern women. The strip debuted on November 22, 1976, and appeared in over 1,400 newspapers at its peak. The strips have been compiled into more than 20 books. Three television specials were also created. Guisewite received the National Cartoonists Society Reuben Award in 1992 for the strip. History Initially, the strip was based largely on Guisewite's own life as a single woman. \\"The syndicate felt it would make the strip more relatable if the character's name and my name were the same,\\" Guisewite said in an interview.\\"The Cathy Guisewite Interview\\" , Hogan's Alley April 24, 2012. \\"They felt it would make it a more personal strip, and it would help people to know it was a real woman who was going through these things. I hated the idea of calling it 'Cathy.' Guisewite had Cathy's longtime boyfriend Irving propose marriage on Valentine's Day 2004. The two characters married in the February 5, 2005 strip. That same year, Cathy appeared in the 75th anniversary party of Blondie and Dagwood. On August 11, 2010, Cathy Guisewite announced the decision to end the run of Cathy. On October 3, 2010, the final strip ran, with the revelation that Cathy is pregnant with a girl. On June 1, 2020, Cathy Commiserations began on GoComics. The earliest strip was dated March 15, 2020. Main characters * Cathy Andrews Hillman (born Katharine Marianna Martucci): the protagonist of the strip and the only one not shown with a nose (although a small one was occasionally seen in side views). Cathy is also the only character that does not have beady eyes; instead, hers are drawn in an inverted heart-shape. * Andrea: initially Cathy's feminist foil and best friend and really her younger sister (Cathy was the eldest of four children, all girls), Andrea's role was reduced in the later years. Andrea is married to Luke, whom she met during an on-line chat, and has two children, Zenith and Gus, who grew from infants to uninhibited teens (not seen in the strips), illustrating‚Äîespecially Zenith‚Äîthat the characters do age, albeit very slowly. With Zenith, Andrea was obsessed with motherhood, to the point of eating special diets while pregnant and playing music on headphones into her pregnant womb to ensure her baby was born with a high IQ, and then bonding so tightly with Zenith that she understood her baby babble perfectly. Gus, however, entered a playgroup and she did not have as strong a connection with him (which initially left her distraught). * Electra: Cathy's dog‚Äîrescued from the animal shelter as a puppy. * Vivian: Irving's dog‚Äîalso a rescue dog from the shelter. Both Cathy and Irving said that the dogs rescued them. * Anne (Annamaria) Andrews (n√©e Martucci): Cathy's mother. Just as likely to provide frustration as inspiration. Refused to throw anything out, even online. Was highly marriage obsessed and was constantly either asking Cathy when she was getting married or trying to fix her up. * Bill Andrews (born Willy Baba): Cathy's father. More often than not, a helpless bystander to Cathy's mom. Cathy went to him when she needed advice about work, something Cathy's mom (even though she had created jobs‚ÄîM.O.Ms, Mothers on the Move, or Granny Nannies, the daycare center in Flo's house) said she knows little about. * Charlene McGuire (n√©e Markota): one of Cathy's best friends and really her cousin, receptionist at her office. Charlene's role expanded greatly once Andrea got married. Charlene announced her pregnancy on Sunday, May 20, 2007.Cathy, May 20, 2007, from gocomics.com * Simon: Charlene's husband. He and Cathy dated ten times before she decided that he wasn't for her. But (at first) Cathy was adamant that Charlene should have adhered to the \\"woman's rules\\" one of which is to never date a woman's old boyfriend. He and Charlene broke up briefly, which led to both her and Cathy signing up for video dating, but they eventually got back together. * Irving Hillman: former on-again-off-again love interest, golf and electronics addict and her husband as of February 5, 2005. The more complex the machinery, the better he liked it‚Äîeven if he did not understand how to set it up. * Mr. Earl Pinkley: Cathy's boss, who often managed to make what little control he actually had of his work environment go a very long way. At one point, he sexually harassed Cathy by coming on to her in her apartment. Cathy solved the problem by telling Charlene what really happened and the gossip about her boss \\"spending the night\\" (he forgot to mention it was due to the fact that he was knocked out when Cathy punched him in the nose). * Mrs Hillman (n√©e Polanski): Irving's mother who treated him like a \\"king\\". Did everything in her power to aggravate Cathy, especially regarding the 2007 Hillman family reunion. * Mr. Hillman: Irving's father. He seemed content to let his wife do all the talking. * Mabel represented multiple people (she was usually seen as the salesperson at any given store). She seemed to work at every single store, bank, travel agency etc. that Cathy or other characters went to (including Andrea's nurse when she had Zenith) and always had a pencil in her hair. She was easily aggravated by Cathy and vice versa. She sometimes had a co-worker with her. In at least one strip, the co-worker was referred to as Edith. * Emerson was one of the first boyfriends introduced (Irving was first) when the strip debuted. He pursued Cathy who figured she could do better and irritated Irving. He was eventually dropped in favor of Irving, but is often mentioned in Cathy's list of those she dated. * Many, many men that Cathy dated briefly. Animated specials Three animated specials were made from the strip: Cathy, Cathy's Last Resort and Cathy's Valentine. All aired on CBS, and the former won Guisewite an Emmy Award. The four basic guilt groups Defined by Cathy Guisewite, the four basic guilt groups are four types of temptation that the character Cathy faces in her daily life. =Food= Cathy had a love/hate affair with food (especially carbs). She loved it, but hated what it did to her thighs. She was visibly overweight, but not obese; she was often shown in a department store fitting room trying to stuff herself into a bathing suit. She was constantly on a diet, weighed herself obsessively and many mornings feared to get up, believing that she had ballooned overnight. Cathy was particularly fond of chocolate, pizza, and her mother's cooking (including her aunt's homemade nut rolls every Christmas, evidence of Cathy being of part Croatian descent, her mother's maiden name being Martucci). =Love= Cathy had dated extensively, but was unable to find \\"Mr. Right\\". Although a number of love interests had come and gone over the years, none had come back like Irving, who had left her initially due to her dislike of cats. Later in the series, they finally marry. At the end of the comic series, Irving and Cathy find out that they are expecting a child. =Mom= Although well-meaning, Mom's advice often frustrated Cathy, whether or not Mom was right. Cathy and her mother were from two different generations: Cathy grew up in the era of feminism, women's rights, and the sexual revolution. Mom was from the earlier, more conservative World War II‚Äî1950s era. Although an equal in her marriage to Cathy's Dad, Mom held many old-fashioned ideas. Prior to Cathy's marriage, she seemed to have an obsession with seeing Cathy married, right down to keeping a current copy of Bride magazine in her purse and going as far as trying to send Christmas cards to some of Cathy's ex-boyfriends, one of whom was incarcerated for swindling investors, until Cathy stopped her. =Work= Cathy had to juggle many tasks at Product Testing, Inc. Her boss, Mr. Pinkley, often asked the impossible, and Cathy always seems to pull through in the end and give him and the client exactly what they wanted, albeit with quite a bit of drama. Cathy also worked at Jamba Juice. She was fired for bringing home smoothies for her cats. She also had numerous other jobs including as a nurse, social worker, pop music artist (her other job when she finally married Irving) and even occasional presidential candidate.

In the season 1 episode \\"Caroline and the Bad Back\\", Caroline hurts her back and is unable to meet a deadline. To prevent the newspapers from double running Cathy strips, Del (Eric Lutes) and Richard (Malcolm Gets) create one for Caroline. The strip is presented as being only funny to men. Upon seeing the strip, Caroline declares that: \\"Cathy is gonna have a field day with this\\". In Sex and the City season 3, \\"Cock-a-doodle-doo\\", Miranda compares her lonely and repetitive take-out orders to a Cathy cartoon, and Carrie asks her never to refer to Cathy again, indicating Cathy's status by 2000 as a symbol of an earlier generation's sad, contemptuous view of single women. (Miranda: \\"I'm sitting home with my cat, ordering the same thing almost every night. The only thing sadder would be a Cathy comic pasted on my refrigerator door.\\" Carrie: \\"Never say Cathy comic to me again\\"). On the series 30 Rock, Cathy has been referenced more than once. On the episode \\"Don Geiss, America and Hope\\", Liz Lemon's boyfriend Wesley compares her obsession with food to being like \\"a Cathy cartoon that just won't end\\". In another episode, Liz exclaims \\"Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, aack!\\", which had been exclaimed by Cathy herself in an earlier cartoon. Broad City season 3, episode 8: \\"Burning Bridges\\" featured a reference to the comic strip. On Saturday Night Live, Andy Samberg would portray Cathy on Weekend Update (Season 34, Episode 17; aired March 7, 2009). In the 2010 The Big Bang Theory episode \\"The Wheaton Recurrence\\", Sheldon, having studied the comic, brings Penny some ice cream after she gets into a fight with her boyfriend Leonard, saying, \\"If you were a cat, I would have brought you a lasagna.\\" In The Simpsons episode \\"Girls Just Wanna Have Sums\\", a painting of Cathy is shown as part of a hall of famous female artists; in the painting, Cathy is shown in a two-piece swimsuit, saying \\"I'm finally able to fit into my bathing suit.... and it's September!\\". In a Simpsons comic strip, Comic Book Guy owns a rare Cathy cartoon - the only one that men find funny.

Telling designated units to leave the parade square/ground. *Attention (United States: Ten-Hut) Have the soldiers adopt the At Attention position *Stand Fast - individual soldiers remain at the attention position regardless of the movement of others in the formation  Rest positions  *Stand at Ease (United States: Parade Rest) has the soldiers in a more relaxed position. *Stand Easy (United States: At Ease) has the soldiers adopt the next easiest stance, where hands are still clasped behind the back, however, the soldiers can relax their upper bodies (the shoulders can be slacked) and quietly speak. This is often, but not always, followed by an implicit 'Relax' ('Rest'). This is typically used when being addressed/lectured for a long period of time where the positions of attention or at ease would be too painful/uncomfortable to hold. *Relax (United States: Rest): The only parade instruction given in an ordinary voice, rather than the raised, emphatic parade voice. This is the only position that actually offers soldiers freedom of movement. Soldiers are typically allowed to move other than moving their feet, though, when it is given by a high-ranking officer, soldiers typically move a minimal amount after a bit of stretching.  Dressing  *Right Dress, ‚Äì all personnel except the right marker bring up their left arms parallel to the ground. At the same time, all members of the formation snap their heads so they are facing right. After this, they pause, and then shuffle back to a new position, where their hand is extremely close to the soldier's shoulder on their right, unless otherwise specified. The American version of this is called Dress Right, DRESS. *Left Dress ‚Äì all personnel except the left marker bring up their right arms parallel to the ground. At the same time, all members of the formation snap their heads so they are facing left. After this, they pause, and then shuffle back to a new position, where their hand is extremely close to the soldier's shoulder on their right, unless otherwise specified. The American version of this is called Dress Left, DRESS. *Inwards Dress/Centre Dress ‚Äì used when a parade is formed up in two or more groups with Colours, Guidons, or Banners on parade. This is used so that dressing is off the colours. The formations to the left of the Colour Party will dress to the right and the formations to the right of the Colour Party will dress to the left. All personnel to the right of the Colours in front row and left column except the left marker take one step forward, pause, and only the front rank bring up their left arms parallel to the ground. At the same time, all members of the formation snap their heads so they are facing left. All personnel to the left of the colours in front row and right side column except the right marker take one step forward, pause, and only the front rank bring up their right arms parallel to the ground. At the same time, all members of the formation snap their heads so they are facing right. *Eyes Front (United States:Ready Front) ‚Äì the front rank snaps their arms down and faces forward, while all other ranks simply face forward. = With weapons =  Rifleshttps://www.merriam- webster.com/dictionary/order%20armshttp://www.907sqn.com/resources/drill/Army%20Drill%20Reference%20401_e.pdf  *Shoulder/Slope Arms: The rifle is brought on the left or right sides by the shoulder. *Change Arms (Commonwealth only): The rifle is changed from one shoulder to another, only possible when in Slope Arms position. *Present Arms: The soldiers bring their weapons to the front of their bodies, and adjust their right foot position. Soldiers without weapons use a salute appropriate for their headdress. In the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth of Nations, the command is often preceded with a General Salute or Royal/Presidential/National Salute, when appropriate. *Order Arms: Servicemen carrying a weapon will lower it to the ground. * Port Arms: The weapon is brought out in front of the soldier, and held by the right hand on small of the butt, or equivalent, and the left hand about the forestock, or equivalent. * High Port Arms: The weapon is brought out in front of the soldier in the form similar to Port Arms but higher so that the butt and forestock or equivalent is raised. *For inspection, Port Arms (United States:Inspection Arms): The weapon are raised at the port position in order that it can be properly inspected. *Reverse arms: The weapon is held reversed as a sign of mourning. * Ground Arms: Servicemen bring their rifles to the ground. * Trail Arms: Servicemen bring their grip from the pistol grip to the carrying handle of the rifle in order to carry the rifle horizontally * Sling Arms: If the soldiers have a \\"sling\\" (strap) on their rifles, then this command can be called. The soldiers will loosen the sling so they can now have their rifles strapped around their shoulders. * Unsling Arms: Servicemen will unloosen the sling so they can now have their rifles at the port or high port position. * Front Sling Arms: Servicemen holding weapons with slings attached to the chest now sling those weapons in the Port or High Port Arms position. *Fire of Joy, load weapons: This command is used in parades such as the National Day Parade in Singapore, and Trooping the Colour. Soldiers will load the rifle with the blank round in preparation of the Feu de joie, French for Fire of Joy in parades. This is called in Polish as the Salwa Honorowa or Honor Volley. *Fix Bayonets: In US ceremonies, whenever the bayonets are to be fixed to the weapons, this command is called out. In times, the accompanying bugle call for it is used before the order is done. The troops pull out their bayonets from their uniforms and attach them to the weapon. *Unfix Bayonets: Soldiers in formation remove their bayonets from their rifles and return them to their uniforms. Sabres *Draw Sabres: used to draw the sabres. *Return Sabres: used to return the sabres. *Present Sabres: used for officers to salute using their sabres. *Shoulder/Slope Sabres: used for officers to slope the sabre in their left-hand shoulder. *Order Sabres: the sabre is lowered to the ground after presenting or sloping. A British soldier in the port arms position. = Forming the parade for the march past/pass in review = *Pass in Review ‚Äì used in the US to denote the start of the march past segment of parades. When this command is said the parade prepares in readiness for the march past. It is also used as a way for a newly assigned commander to inspect the troops he/she commands. * Parade, in close order, left/right dress ‚Äì in the UK, this command is used to commence dressing of parade units in close order * Company, in close order, form three/four ranks ‚Äì in the UK, this command is used to form companies into three or four ranks of personnel each * Staff behind me, (forward) march ‚Äì in the US, this command is used by the parade commander to form his parade staff in readiness for the march past/pass in review segment of parades * Parade will now advance/retire in slow/quick time, about turn ‚Äì in the Commonwealth the command is used to form parade formations when arranged in line formation for the march past * Distance by a single lineman - in the former Soviet Union and in countries that were trained by the Soviet Armed Forces (except the Baltics) this ensures that the distance of the formations of parade (either of company or battalion size) be equal to those of the parade armed linemen that line the parade grounds or square for the march past * Move to the right/left in twos/threes/fours - in the Commonwealth, this command is used for a company or companies to execute left/right turn forming either two, three or four ranks = Saluting on the march = In the Commonwealth countries, the following saluting on the march commands are ordered with a preparatory command of 'Saluting on the march...'. For example, 'Saluting on the march, to the front Salute' and always called on the left foot. *To the front Salute or Salute: The parade is halted and the right arm is raised so the forearm is placed at a 90¬∞ angle, while pointing at the temple. This is lowered and then repeated again, followed by an about turn and a resume in marching (off the left foot). The timing is: \\"Call, Check, Halt, 2, 3, Up, 2, 3, Down, 2, 3, 4, 5, Up, 2, 3, Down, 2, 3, About, 2, 3, In, 2, 3, Left, Right, Left!\\" It is one of, if not the longest drill movement in the military. In British Corps, the drill movement for saluting to the front is the following. Two, three, up. Two, three, down. *To the Right Salute: The right arm is raised so the forearm is placed at a 90¬∞ angle, while pointing at the temple. It is generally to a count of \\"Up, two, three, four, five, down, swing!\\" :This is done while looking to the right, except the right marker, who must stay looking to the front, to keep the flight, squad, platoon, etc. staying straight. *To the Left Salute: The right arm is raised so the forearm is placed at a 90¬∞ angle, while pointing at the temple. It is generally to a count of \\"Up, two, three, four, five, down, away!\\" :This is done while looking to the left, except the left marker (as they are the front most of the saluting flank), who must stay looking to the front, to keep the flight, squad, platoon, etc. staying straight. In the United States, the command for saluting on the march is \\"Eyes, RIGHT/LEFT.\\" The parade formation commander and other officers execute the hand salute or execute sabre salute if available (especially if full dress uniform is worn) (and if present on parade the company guidon bearers dip them in salute about 90 degress above the ground), while everyone but the right file or left file in either case turns their heads to the right. The command for recovery is \\"Ready, FRONT.\\" If the command does not have rifles, they will salute if given the command present ARMS. The arms will be lowered back to their normal position on the commands Order ARMS. They can also salute if given the command Hand SALUTE. The salute is raised when the parade leader finishes saying \\"salute\\", and is lowered in after being held for the same amount of time elapsed between the words \\"hand\\" and \\"salute.\\" = Compliments on the March = *Eyes Right: The parade turn their heads to the right after a check pace. The parade leader salutes while looking in the direction they gave. :This is done while looking to the right, except the right marker, who must stay looking to the front, to keep the flight, squad, platoon, etc. staying straight. *Eyes Left: Similar to the Eyes Right except the parade looks to the left. :This is done while looking to the left, except the left marker, who must stay looking to the front, to keep the flight, squad, platoon, etc. staying straight. Saluting at the halt (static) *To the front Salute or Salute: The right arm is raised so the forearm is placed at a 90¬∞ angle, while pointing at the temple. It is generally to a count of \\"Up, two, three, down!\\" *To the Right Salute: The right arm is raised so the forearm is placed at a 90¬∞ angle, while pointing at the temple. It is generally to a count of \\"Up, two, three, down!\\" *To the Left Salute: The right arm is raised so the forearm is placed at a 90¬∞ angle, while pointing at the temple. It is generally to a count of \\"Up, two, three, down!\\" In the United States, salutes at a halt are given on the command \\"Hand Salute\\". They are lowered in the same amount of time elapsed between the two words. The command \\"present arms\\" will cause the command to salute if the command is not given rifles for the ceremony, but the salute will be held until they are ordered to lower it with the command \\"order arms\\". *Advance in Review Order, by the centre, Quick March: This is used to pay final compliments to the reviewing officer. On this very command the unit being reviewed advances 15 paces and halts automatically before presenting arms to the reviewing officer. It is usually employed by the British Army and the Canadian Army, as well as by other Commonwealth armed forces. =Colour commands= Marching with colours *Let Fly the Colours: The colours are normally held in a semi-taut position. This is a simple, ceremonial letting fly and catching of the colours. *Slant Colours: The colours are normally kept upright, but this can represent a problem both when dealing with standard doors. This slants the colours forward sufficiently to negate this, and they are brought back up afterward. *Slope/Shoulder Colours: The normal method for carrying colours can be tiresome for the bearer. This has the colours taken out of their frogs and sloped over the right shoulder at about 45¬∞. * March on/off (Retire) the Colours - this vocal command by the parade commander orders the colour guard or massed colour guards either to get into position or prepare for departure in the parade square or ground during the ceremony * Colours, (by the) centre, (quick) march - this command is used whenever the Colours are to be marched on to the center of the parade ground to take post Colour commands at the halt (static) *Order Colours: Essentially the same as Order Arms, except used exclusively for the Colour Party. *Carry Colours: This is equivalent to Shoulder Arms. The right arm lifts the colours up so they line up with the body's centre line, with the right arm held in front of the soldier, at mouth level parallel to the ground. It is caught and guided into its frog with the left hand, which is then returned to its side. *Change colours: This is used when the senior flag officer decides that he/she and the other flag holding members, have held their flags for a long time, and that their arms are tired, so, when the command \\"Change - colours!\\" is given, the flag holders put their arms in line with the flag, their other hand on top of their first hand and move the first hand down to attention, so that the other hand is now at the first hands' original position. =Turning motions= =Turning motions at the march= *Right Turn (U.S.:Column right, MARCH): A 90¬∞ turn to the right done by rotating on the right heel and left ball. The cautionary and executive are both called on the left foot. The left leg is then brought up to be parallel to the ground (although exceptions are made for kilted regiments) and slammed into the ground in the position of attention. This motion is done at a particular fixed point. *Left Turn (U.S.:Column left, MARCH): A 90¬∞ turn to the left, done by rotation on the right ball and the left heel. The right leg is then brought up to be parallel to the ground and slammed down into attention. This motion is done at a particular fixed point. *About Turn (U.S.: To the rear, MARCH): A 180¬∞ turn to the right, done as an exaggerated version of the right turn. United States units do not make exaggerated gestures with the legs or arms. *Right Flank MARCH or Right turn, it is still the same even on the march for some countries: All members marching execute 90¬∞ turn to the right done by rotating on the right heel and left ball. *Left Flank MARCH or Left turn, it is still the same even on the march for some countries: All members marching 90¬∞ turn to the left, done by rotation on the right ball and the left heel. *Right Incline (U.S.:Column half-right, MARCH), is a half turn to the right, usually used when a flight, squad, platoon, etc. is not in its proper alignment. All members marching turn by 45¬∞ to the right, done by rotation on the left ball and the right heel. *Left Incline (U.S.:Column half- left, MARCH), is a half turn to the left, usually used when a flight, squad, platoon, etc. is not in its proper alignment. All members marching turn by 45¬∞ to the left, done by rotation on the right ball and the left heel. *Right Wheel, is a turn to the right, differentiated from a Right Turn in that the order of march remains the same. *Left Wheel, is a mirror of the Right Wheel. Turning motions at the halt (static) United States Armed Forces: *Right Face: The body is rotated on the heel of the right foot and then the left heel is brought forward to meet the right heel in the position of attention. *Left Face: A mirror image of Right Face. *About Face: The right toe is brought back to behind the left heel; the body pivots on the right toe and left heel 180¬∞. *Half-Left Face: Exactly the same as a left face, but one turns only 45¬∞. *Half-Right Face: Exactly the same as a right face, but one turns only 45¬∞. Commonwealth of Nations *Right Turn: The body is rotated 90¬∞ to the right members shall bend the left knee, straighten it in double time and smartly place the left foot beside the right to assume the position of attention. In the Royal Navy, the heel movements mirror that of the US Armed Forces. *Left Turn: A mirror image of Right Turn. *About Turn: The body is rotated 180¬∞ in a clockwise direction, knees locked. Members shall bend the left knee, straighten it in double time and smartly place the left foot beside the right to assume the position of attention. In the Royal Navy heel movements are the same for Right Face. *Right Incline: Exactly the same as a right turn, but one turns only 45¬∞. *Left Incline: Exactly the same as a left turn, but one turns only 45¬∞. =Marching motions= *Quick March: The standard pace is typically 116 beats/minute with a 30in. step. There is also a Rifleman's Pace, 140 beats/minute and a Highland Pace, 110 beats/minute (typically done with a kilt.) The pace is based on the individual regiments, the pace given by the commander, and the speed of the band's rhythm. The way the march is performed depends on the regiment's nationality. *Slow March: This is a ceremonial pace, used for funerals and when a unit's colours are marched out in front of the troops. The standard pace is 65 beats per minute. *Half Step March or Cut the pace: :*This is a U.S. march pace. It is at the same tempo as Quick Time, but instead of 30 inches, the step is 15 inches. :*There is also a Canadian and Commonwealth version of this, used for when the front file/rank is getting too far ahead of the rest of the flight, squad, or platoon, it means that front file/rank should make their steps smaller, to allow for the rest of the flight, squad, or platoon, to get back into a proper dressing. *Double March: This is essentially a moderate jog at approximately 180 paces per minute. It creates a travel speed of approximately double that of Quick Time, designed to be used even when carrying heavy burdens. This is often erroneously used to describe a sprint or an ordinary run. The U.S. command is \\"Double Time, MARCH.\\" *Easy March: This is an unrestricted march at approximately Quick Time. This is designed for field marches and other rough conditions, though is not used in combat areas. The U.S. command is \\"Route Step, MARCH.\\" In the Canadian Forces the command \\"March at, EASE\\" is given while the unit is on the march. It can not be given from the halt. *Mark Time: This is essentially a stationary march with the knees coming up parallel to the ground or the foot dangling six inches off of the ground. This is designed to maintain the time of large parades when portions need no forward speed. The U.S. equivalent command is \\"Mark Time, MARCH.\\" *Step For -Ward or Forward or Forward, March: This causes troops marking time to resume a normal march. Historical drill commands for parade =Musket drill= The 18th-century musket, as typified by the Brown Bess, was loaded and fired in the following way: #Upon the command \\"Prime and load\\". The soldier will bring the musket to the priming position, with the pan opened. #Upon the command \\"Handle Cartridge\\". The soldier will draw a cartridge. Cartridges consist of a spherical lead bullet wrapped in a paper cartridge which also holds the gunpowder propellant. The bullet is separated from the powder charge by a twist in the paper. #The soldier should then bite off the top of the cartridge (the end without the bullet) and hold it closed with the thumb and index finger. #Upon the command \\"Prime\\". The soldier should pour a small pinch of the powder from the cartridge into the priming pan. He should then close the frizzen so that the priming powder is trapped. #Upon the command \\" 'Bout\\" (About). The butt of the musket is then dropped to the ground by the left foot with the trigger guard facing to the rear and the soldier having just poured the rest of the powder into the barrel. Once all of the powder is poured into the barrel, the soldier should have stuffed the paper and the ball into the barrel, the paper acts as wadding to keep the gunpowder in the barrel and also packing it down. #Upon the command \\"Draw ramrods\\". The soldier should draw his ramrod from below the barrel. First forcing it half out before seizing it backhanded in the middle, followed by drawing it entirely out, while simultaneously turning it to the front and placing it one inch into the barrel. #Upon the command \\"Ram down the cartridge\\". He should then use the ramrod to firmly ram the bullet, wadding, and powder down to the bottom followed by tamping it down with two quick strokes. #Upon the command \\"Return ramrods\\". The ramrod is then returned to its hoops under the barrel. Then the musket is returned to the shoulder arms position. #Upon the command \\"Make Ready\\". The musket is brought to the recover position (held vertically in front of the body with the trigger guard facing forward) and the cock (hammer) is drawn back to the full-cock position. #Upon the command \\"P'sent\\" (Present). The musket is brought up to the firing position in anticipation of the command \\"Fire\\". *Under battle conditions, many of these commands were combined for speed and efficiency. On the command \\"Prime and Load\\" troops would, without further order, carry out all movements up to and including \\"Make Ready\\". Because of the size of the companies and the general noise of battle, these commands could be and were often communicated through specialized drum beatings. *This process was drilled into troops until they could do it by instinct and feel. The main advantage of the British Redcoat was that he trained at this procedure almost every day. The standard for the British Army was the ability to load and fire three rounds per minute. A skilled unit of musketeers was often able to fire four rounds per minute. =Cavalry drill= Cavalry drill had the purpose of training cavalrymen and their horses to work together during a battle. It survives , albeit in a much-diminished form, in the modern sporting discipline of dressage. The movements sideways or at angles, the pirouettes, etc., were the movements needed for massed cavalrymen to form and reform and deploy. Of the proponents of classical dressage from which modern dressage evolved, probably the best known are the Lipizzaner Stallions of the Spanish Riding School in Vienna. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police's Musical Ride gives an inkling of what massed cavalry drill at speed would have looked like. =Other drills= Other tasks may be broken down into drills; for example, weapons maintenance in the British army used the rhythmic \\"naming of parts\\" as a memory aid in the teaching and learning of how to strip, clean, and reassemble the service rifle.

They have no structural purpose but may be considered lucky, akin to a horseshoe mounted over a doorway. They are especially common in Pennsylvania and frequently seen in German-American farming communities. They are also found in Canada, particularly in the province of Ontario. History Barnstars were meant to represent the mark of the builder but became more frequently used for aesthetic purposes and were added to the building after construction was complete. Enthusiasts have traced a number of wooden barnstars to individual builders in the Pennsylvania area, where numerous examples can still be seen. Barnstars were used in the United States during the 18th century and as late as 1870 in Pennsylvania, where their popularity increased greatly following the Civil War. Their regular use preceded that time, however, and stars were commonplace on large buildings, particularly factories, in pre-war Richmond, Virginia. Barnstars remain a popular form of decoration, and modern houses are sometimes decorated with simple, metal, five-pointed stars which the makers describe as \\"barn-stars\\". They are often deliberately distressed or rusted, alluding to the traditional decoration. Other star-shaped plates On older buildings in the Pennsylvania Dutch area of the United States, it is still possible to find barnstar-like building adornments that are painted, rather than wooden or metal, known as hex signs. Strictly speaking, they are defined apart from barnstars and visually bear only passing resemblance, but the two are often confused and their names are even regarded as interchangeable. Some hex signs incorporate star shapes, while others may take the form of a rosette or contain pictures of birds and other animals. The term barnstar has been applied to star-shaped anchor plates that are used for structural reinforcement, particularly on masonry buildings from the 18th and 19th centuries. These are made of cast iron and are used as tie plates serving as the washers for tie rods. The tie-rod-and-plate assembly serves to brace the masonry wall against tilting or lateral bowing.

It is filled to a depth of about with water that is heavily acidic (2.5 pH level), about the acidity of Coca-Cola, lemon juice,Edwin Dobb. \\"New Life in a Death Trap\\". Discover, 2000. or gastric acid. As a result, the pit is laden with heavy metals and dangerous chemicals that leach from the rock, including copper, arsenic, cadmium, zinc, and sulfuric acid. The mine was opened in 1955 and operated by the Anaconda Copper Mining Company, and later by the Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO), until its closure on Earth Day in 1982. When the pit was closed, the water pumps in the nearby Kelley Mine, below the surface, were turned off, and groundwater from the surrounding aquifers began to slowly fill the Berkeley Pit, rising at about the rate of a month. Since its closure, the water level in the pit has risen to within of the natural water table. The Berkeley Pit is currently one of the largest Superfund sites. The water, with dissolved oxygen, allows pyrite and sulfide minerals in the ore and wall rocks to decay, releasing acid. The acidic water in the pit carries a heavy load of dissolved heavy metals. A water treatment plant has been operating since October 2019 The Berkeley Pit is a tourist attraction, with an adjacent gift shop. An admission fee is charged to go out on the viewing platform. History The Berkeley Pit in May 1984. The underground Berkeley Mine was located on a prominent vein extending to the southeast from the main Anaconda vein system. When open pit mining operations began in July 1955, near the Berkeley Mine shaft, the older mine gave its name to the pit. The open-pit style of mining superseded underground operations because it was far more economical and much less dangerous than underground mining. Within the first year of operation, the pit extracted 17,000 tons of ore per day at a grade of 0.75% copper. Ultimately, about 1,000,000,000 tons of material were mined from the Berkeley Pit. Copper was the principal metal produced, although other metals were also extracted, including silver and gold. Two communities and much of Butte's previously crowded east side were consumed by land purchases to expand the pit during the 1970s. The Anaconda Company bought the homes, businesses and schools of the working-class communities of Meaderville, East Butte, and McQueen, east of the pit site. Many of these homes were either destroyed, buried, or moved to the southern end of Butte. Residents were compensated at market value for their acquired property.  Pollution, toxicity, and cleanup  Composite Fisheye View of the Berkeley Pit, April 2005 Perspective: Power line poles descending the walls of the pit. The poles are located slightly to the right of center in the above Composite Fisheye View, April 2005. The Berkeley Pit is a part of the Silver Bow Creek/Butte Area Environmental Protection Agency Superfund site, considered one of the largest in America, and the pit itself was added to the federal Superfund site list in 1987. It is one of sixteen Superfund sites in Montana, and the Berkeley Pit is the final unrestored section of the Silver Bow Creek/Butte Area site. In 1995, a flock of migrating geese landed in the Berkeley Pit and died. A total of 342 carcasses were recovered. ARCO, the custodian of the pit, denied that the toxic water caused the death of the geese, attributing the deaths to an acute aspergillosis infection that may have been caused by a grain fungus, as substantiated by Colorado State University necropsy findings. These findings were disputed by the State of Montana on the basis of its own lab tests. Necropsies showed their insides were lined with burns and festering sores from exposure to high concentrations of copper, cadmium, and arsenic. (Levels of copper are high enough that Montana Resources has mined copper directly from the water.) On November 28, 2016, several thousand snow geese died after a large flock landed in the pit's water to avoid a snow storm. Immediately after the event, officials made efforts to scare birds away and prevent more from landing in the area. An official report issued in 2017 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service found that the 3,000 to 4,000 snow geese that died at the Berkeley Pit were killed by exposure to sulfuric acid and heavy metals. The Berkeley Pit started utilizing Phoenix Wailers, which have been effective in deterring birds from landing at or staying in Berkeley Pit for an extended period of time. Studies have shown that the Wailers have been effective in limiting bird deaths in most cases, but they have not worked as well when faced with a large number of birds. Staff also use firearms to scare away birds during spring migration seasons. Construction began on a treatment plant at the Berkeley Pit in 2018, to treat water in the Pit before the water level before it contaminates local groundwater. The treatment facility will be able to treat ten million gallons of water per day. Construction of the $19 million facility was completed in August 2019 and the first discharge of treated water into a local creek happened in October of 2019. =Important dates= *1994 ‚Äì September, EPA/DEQ issue Record of Decision (ROD) for Butte Mine Flooding Operable Unit. *1996 ‚Äì April, Montana Resources (MR) and ARCO divert Horseshoe Bend (HSB) drainage water away from Berkeley Pit to slow filling rate, per ROD. *2000 ‚Äì July, MR suspends mining operations due to high energy costs; HSB water allowed to flow back into pit, increasing pit filling rate. *2002 ‚Äì March, USEPA and Montana Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) enter into a Consent Decree with BP/ARCO and the Montana Resources Group (known as the Settling Defendants) for settlement of past and future costs for this site. *2002 ‚Äì Fall, USEPA and MDEQ issue order for Settling Defendants to begin design of water treatment plant for HSB water.

Geography The mine is at , at an altitude of 4,698 feet (1432 m) above mean sea level. =Geology= The Butte mining district is characterized by the Late Cretaceous Boulder batholith which metamorphosed surrounding rocks during the Laramide orogeny. Ore formation occurred with the intrusion of the Butte quartz monzonite pluton. Mining of sulfide minerals began in the district in 1864. Placer deposits were mined out by 1867. Silver vein lodes were then the most productive until copper was discovered in 1888. Open-pit mining started in 1955. Copper has historically been the main metal produced, though lead, zinc, manganese, silver and gold have been produced at various times.

Stierle and Donald B. Stierle, and the protozoans have been found to have adapted to the harsh conditions of the water. Intense competition for the limited resources caused these species to evolve the production of highly toxic compounds to improve survivability; natural products such as Berkeleydione, berkeleytrione, and Berkelic acid have been isolated from these organisms which show selective activity against cancer cell lines. Some of these species ingest metals and are being investigated as an alternative means of cleaning the water. Photos File:BerkeleyPit2.jpgThe Berkeley Pit mine in Butte Montana.

The strip focused on a career woman facing the issues and challenges of eating, work, relationships, and having a mother‚Äîor as the character put it in one strip, \\"the four basic guilt groups.\\" Early life Guisewite was born in Dayton, Ohio to William L. and Anne Guisewite. She was raised in Midland, Michigan with older sister Mary Anne Nagyfineartamerica.com, Mary Anne Nagy. and younger sister Mickey. Guisewite graduated from Midland High School in 1968. She attended the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, where she was a member of the Delta Delta Delta sorority. In 1972, she earned a bachelor's degree in English. Career After college, Guisewite followed her father's vocation and began working in advertising at Campbell-Ewald, then Norman Prady before settling at W.B. Doner & Co. near Detroit. She became a vice president of the firm in 1976. She continued to draw funny pictures as an \\"emotional coping mechanism\\" to events in her life and work, and she would forward them to her parents. Her mother kept urging her to send them to a publisher, so finally, she did. \\"My entire goal with my submission package was to get my mother off my back. My goal was not to do a comic strip. It was to make Mom quit telling me I could do a comic strip.\\" Guisewite was flabbergasted when the company sent her a contract to produce a comic strip. Cathy was syndicated to 66 newspapers in 1976 by Universal Press Syndicate, now Universal Uclick, and Guisewite did both‚Äîher advertising job during the day, and comics at night. By 1980, the strip was carried by 150 dailies and she was earning $50,000 per year for Cathy, so she finally quit the advertising business to work on Cathy full-time and moved to Santa Barbara, California. The comic strip was a \\"running social commentary\\" for her confusion. Guisewite explained, \\"You were a liberated woman or you were a traditionalist. To even voice vulnerability if you were a feminist was wrong and to voice interest in liberation if you were a more traditional woman was wrong. So I believe the women I was speaking to in the early years of my strip were women like me, who were at that age in our 20s where we were kind of launched into adulthood with a foot in both worlds and no way to really express it.‚Äù Guisewite appeared several times as a guest on the late night TV series The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. At the peak of the strip's popularity in the mid-1990s, it appeared in almost 1,400 papers. However, on August 11, 2010, Guisewite announced the strip's retirement after 34 years. Its run ended on October 3, 2010 (a Sunday strip). Awards In 1987, she received an Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program for the TV special Cathy, which aired on CBS. Guisewite is a member of the National Cartoonists Society and received in 1993 their highest honor, the Reuben Award for Outstanding Cartoonist of the Year for her work of 1992. Guisewite has been granted three honorary degrees from Russell Sage College, Rhode Island College and Eastern Michigan University. Personal life Guisewite adopted daughter Ivy in 1992, then married screenwriter Christopher Wilkinson in 1997. Wilkinson has a son, Cooper, but the couple had no children together. Guisewite and Wilkinson divorced in 2010. One of Guisewite's classmates at the University of Michigan was screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan. When Kasdan's movie The Big Chill (1983) opened, Guisewite devoted an entire week of Cathy strips to it, with Cathy and her co-workers enthusing over the film and seeing it repeatedly.

R. pachyptila lives on the floor of the Pacific Ocean near hydrothermal vents, and can tolerate extremely high hydrogen sulfide levels. These worms can reach a length of , and their tubular bodies have a diameter of . Ambient temperature in their natural environment ranges from 2 to 30¬∞C. Its common name \\"giant tube worm\\" is, however, also applied to the largest living species of shipworm, Kuphus polythalamia, which despite the name \\"worm\\", is a bivalve mollusc rather than an annelid. DSV Alvin, the Navy research submarine Discovery R. pachyptila was discovered in 1977 on an expedition of the American bathyscaphe DSV Alvin to the Gal√°pagos Rift led by geologist Jack Corliss. The discovery was unexpected, as the team was studying hydrothermal vents and no biologists were included in the expedition. Many of the species found living near hydrothermal vents during this expedition had never been seen before. At the time, the presence of thermal springs near the midoceanic ridges was known. Further research uncovered aquatic life in the area, despite the high temperature (around 350 ‚Äì 380 ¬∞C). Many samples were collected, for example, bivalves, polychaetes, large crabs, and R. pachyptila. It was the first time that species was observed. Development R. pachyptila develops from a free-swimming, pelagic, nonsymbiotic trochophore larva, which enters juvenile (metatrochophore) development, becoming sessile, and subsequently acquiring symbiotic bacteria. The symbiotic bacteria, on which adult worms depend for sustenance, are not present in the gametes, but are acquired from the environment through the skin in a process akin to an infection. The digestive tract transiently connects from a mouth at the tip of the ventral medial process to a foregut, midgut, hindgut, and anus and was previously thought to have been the method by which the bacteria are introduced into adults. After symbionts are established in the midgut, they undergo substantial remodelling and enlargement to become the trophosome, while the remainder of the digestive tract has not been detected in adult specimens. Body structure Hydrothermal vent tubeworms get organic compounds from bacteria that live in their trophosome. Isolating the vermiform body from white chitonous tube, a small difference exists from the classic three subdivisions typical of phylum Pogonophora: the prosoma, the mesosoma, and the metasoma. R. pachyptila community with extroflexion of red branchial plume The first body region is the vascularized branchial plume, which is bright red due to the presence of hemoglobin that contain up to 144 globin chains (each presumably including associated heme structures). These tube worm hemoglobins are remarkable for carrying oxygen in the presence of sulfide, without being inhibited by this molecule, as hemoglobins in most other species are. The plume provides essential nutrients to bacteria living inside the trophosome. If the animal perceives a threat or is touched, it retracts the plume and the tube is closed due to the obturaculum, a particular operculum that protects and isolates the animal from the external environment. The second body region is the vestimentum, formed by muscle bands, having a winged shape, and it presents the two genital openings at the end. The heart, extended portion of dorsal vessel, enclose the vestimentum. In the middle part, the trunk or third body region, is full of vascularized solid tissue, and includes body wall, gonads, and the coelomic cavity. Here is located also the trophosome, spongy tissue where a billion symbiotic, thioautotrophic bacteria and sulfur granules are found. Since the mouth, digestive system, and anus are missing, the survival of R. pachyptila is dependent on this mutualistic symbiosis. This process, known as chemosynthesis, was recognized within the trophosome by Colleen Cavanaugh. The soluble hemoglobins, present in the tentacles, are able to bind O2 and H2S, which are necessary for chemosynthetic bacteria. Due to the capillaries, these compounds are absorbed by bacteria. During the chemosynthesis, the mitochondrial enzyme rhodanase catalyzes the disproportionation reaction of the thiosulfate anion S2O32- to sulfur S and sulfite SO32- . The R. pachyptila‚Äôs bloodstream is responsible for absorption of the O2 and nutrients such as carbohydrates. Nitrate and nitrite are toxic, but are required for biosynthetic processes. The chemosynthetic bacteria within the trophosome convert nitrate to ammonium ions, which then are available for production of amino acids in the bacteria, which are in turn released to the tube worm. To transport nitrate to the bacteria, R. pachyptila concentrates nitrate in its blood, to a concentration 100 times more concentrated than the surrounding water. The exact mechanism of R. pachyptila‚Äôs ability to withstand and concentrate nitrate is still unknown. In the posterior part, the fourth body region, is the opistosome, which anchors the animal to the tube and is used for the storage of waste from bacterial reactions.  Symbiosis  The discovery of bacterial invertebrate chemoautotrophic symbiosis, particularly in vestimentiferan tubeworms R. pachyptila and then in vesicomyid clams and mytilid mussels revealed the chemoautotrophic potential of the hydrothermal vent tube worm. Scientists discovered a remarkable source of nutrition that helps to sustain the conspicuous biomass of invertebrates at vents. Many studies focusing on this type of symbiosis revealed the presence of chemoautotrophic, endosymbiotic, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria mainly in R. pachyptila, which inhabits extreme environments and is adapted to the particular composition of the mixed volcanic and sea waters. This special environment is filled with inorganic metabolites, essentially carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. In its adult phase, 'R. pachyptila lacks a digestive system. To provide its energetic needs, it retains those dissolved inorganic nutrients (sulfide, carbon dioxide, oxygen, nitrogen) into its plume and transports them through a vascular system to the trophosome, which is suspended in paired coelomic cavities and is where the intracellular symbiotic bacteria are found. The trophosome is a soft tissue that runs through almost the whole length of the tube's coelom. It retains a large number of bacteria on the order of 109 bacteria per gram of fresh weight. Bacteria in the trophosome are retained inside bacteriocytes, thereby having no contact with the external environment. Thus, they rely on R. pachyptila for the assimilation of nutrients needed for the array of metabolic reactions they employ and for the excretion of waste products of carbon fixation pathways. At the same time, the vestimentiferan depends completely on the microorganisms for the byproducts of their carbon fixation cycles that are needed for its growth. Initial evidence for a chemoautotrophic symbiosis in R. pachyptila came from microscopic and biochemical analyses showing Gram-negative bacteria packed within a highly vascularized organ in the tubeworm trunk called the trophosome. Additional analyses involving stable isotope, enzymatic, and physiological characterizations herbely confirmed that the end symbionts of R. pachyptila oxidize reduced-sulfur compounds to synthesize ATP for use in autotrophic carbon fixation through the Calvin cycle. The host tubeworm enables the uptake and transport of the substrates required for thioautotrophy, which are HS‚àí, O2, and CO2, receiving back a portion of the organic matter synthesized by the symbiont population. The adult tubeworm, given its inability to feed on particulate matter and its entire dependency on its symbionts for nutrition, the bacterial population is then the primary source of carbon acquisition for the symbiosis. Discovery of bacterial‚Äìinvertebrate chemoautotrophic symbioses, initially in vestimentiferan tubeworms and then in vesicomyid clams and mytilid mussels, pointed to an even more remarkable source of nutrition sustaining the invertebrates at vents.  Endosymbiosis with thioautotrophic bacteria  A wide range of bacterial diversity is associated with symbiotic relationships with R. pachyptila. Many bacteria belong to the class Epsilonproteobacteria as supported by the recent discovery in 2016 of the new species Sulfurovum riftiae belonging to the class Epsilonproteobacteria, family Helicobacteraceae isolated from R. pachyptila collected from the East Pacific Rise. Other symbionts belong to the class Delta-, Alpha- and Gamma- proteobacteria. The Candidatus Endoriftia persephone is a facultative R. pachyptila symbiont and has been shown to be a mixotroph, thereby exploiting both Calvin Benson cycle and reverse TCA cycle (with an unusual ATP citrate lyase) according to availability of carbon resources and whether it is free living in the environment or inside a eukaryotic host. The bacteria apparently prefer a heterotrophic lifestyle when carbon sources are available. Evidence based on 16S rRNA analysis affirms that R. pachyptilachemoautotrophic bacteria belong to two different phyla of Proteobacteria superphylum: Gammaproteobacteria phylum and Epsilonproteobacteria phylum (e.g. Sulfurovum riftiae) that get energy from the oxidation of inorganic sulfur compounds such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S, HS‚àí, S2-) to synthetize ATP for carbon fixation via the Calvin cycle. Unfortunately, most of these bacteria are still uncultivable. Symbiosis works so that R. pachyptila provides nutrients such as HS‚àí, O2, CO2 to bacteria, and in turn it receives organic matter from them. Thus, because of lack of a digestive system, R. pachyptila depends entirely on its bacterial symbiont to survive. In the first step of sulfide-oxidation, reduced sulfur (HS‚àí) passes from the external environment into R. pachyptila blood, where, together with O2, it is bound by hemoglobin, forming the complex Hb-O2-HS‚àí and then it is transported to the trophosome, where bacterial symbionts reside. Here, HS‚àí is oxidized to elemental sulfur (S0) or to sulfite (SO32-). In the second step, the symbionts make sulfite-oxidation by the \\"APS pathway\\", to get ATP. In this biochemical pathway, AMP reacts with sulfite in the presence of the enzyme APS reductase, giving APS (adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate). Then, APS reacts with the enzyme ATP sulfurylase in presence of pyrophosphate (PPi) giving ATP (substrate-level phosphorylation) and sulfate (SO42-) as end products. In formulas: * AMP + SO3^2- ->[APSreductase] APS * APS + PPi ->[ATP sulfurylase] ATP + SO4^2- The electrons released during the entire sulfide-oxidation process enter in an electron transport chain, yielding a proton gradient that produces ATP (oxydative phosphorylation). Thus, ATP generated from oxidative phosphorylation and ATP produced by substrate-level phosphorylation become available for CO2 fixation in Calvin cycle, whose presence has been demonstrated by the presence of two key enzymes of this pathway: phosphoribulokinase and RubisCO. To support this unusual metabolism, R. pachyptila has to absorb all the substances necessary for both sulfide- oxidation and carbon fixation, that is: HS‚àí, O2 and CO2 and other fundamental bacterial nutrients such as N and P. This means that the tubeworm must be able to access both oxic and anoxic areas. Oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds requires the presence of oxidized reagents such as oxygen and nitrate. Hydrothermal vents are characterized by conditions of high hypoxia. In hypoxic conditions, sulfur-storing organisms start producing hydrogen sulfide. Therefore, the production of in H2S in anaerobic conditions is common among thiotrophic symbiosis. H2S can be damaging for some physiological processes as it inhibits the activity of cytochrome c oxidase, consequentially impairing oxidative phosphorilation. In R. pachyptila the production of hydrogen sulfide starts after 24h of hypoxia. In order to avoid physiological damage some animals, including Riftia pachyptila are able to bind H2S to haemoglobin in the blood to eventually expel it in the surrounding environment.  Carbon fixation and organic carbon assimilation  Unlike metazoans, which respire carbon dioxide as a waste product, R. pachyptila-symbiont association has a demand for a net uptake of CO2 instead, as a cnidarian-symbiont associations. Ambient deep-sea water contains an abundant amount of inorganic carbon in the form of bicarbonate HCO3‚àí, but it is actually the chargeless form of inorganic carbon, CO2, that is easily diffusible across membranes. The low partial pressures of CO2 in the deep-sea environment is due to the seawater alkaline pH and the high solubility of CO2, yet the pCO2 of the blood of R. pachyptila may be as much as two orders of magnitude greater than the pCO2 of deep-sea water. CO2 partial pressures are transferred to the vicinity of vent fluids due to the enriched inorganic carbon content of vent fluids and their lower pH. CO2 uptake in the worm is enhanced by the higher pH of its blood (7.3 ‚Äì 7.4), which favors the bicarbonate ion and thus promotes a steep gradient across which CO2 diffuses into the vascular blood of the plume. The facilitation of CO2 uptake by high environmental pCO2 was first inferred based on measures of elevated blood and coelomic fluid pCO2 in tubeworms, and was subsequently demonstrated through incubations of intact animals under various pCO2 conditions. Once CO2 is fixed by the symbionts, it must be assimilated by the host tissues. The supply of fixed carbon to the host is transported via organic molecules from the trophosome in the hemolymph, but the relative importance of translocation and symbiont digestion is not yet known. Studies proved that within 15 min, the label first appears in symbiont-free host tissues, and that indicates a significant amount of release of organic carbon immediately after fixation. After 24 h, labeled carbon is clearly evident in the epidermal tissues of the body wall. Results of the pulse-chase autoradiographic experiments were also evident with ultrastructural evidence for digestion of symbionts in the peripheral regions of the trophosome lobules.  Sulfide acquisition  In deep-sea hydrothermal vents, sulfide and oxygen are present in different areas. Indeed, vent fluid of hydrothermal vents is rich in sulfide, but poor in oxygen, whereas sea water is rich in oxygen. Moreover, sulfide reacts immediately with oxygen to form sulfur compounds like S2O32- or SO42-, unusable for microbial metabolism. This causes the substrates to be less available for microbial activity, thus bacteria are constricted to compete with oxygen to get their nutrients. In order to avoid this issue, several microbes have evolved to make symbiosis with eukaryotic hosts. In fact, R. pachyptila is able to cover the oxic and anoxic areas to get both sulfide and oxygen. Thanks to its hemoglobin that can bind sulfide reversibly and apart from oxygen by means of two cysteine residues, and then transport it to the trophosome, where bacterial metabolism can occur.  Symbiont acquisition  The acquisition of a symbiont by a host can occur in these ways: *Environmental transfer (symbiont acquired from a free-living population in the environment) * Vertical transfer (parents transfer symbiont to offspring via eggs) * Horizontal transfer (hosts that share the same environment) Evidence suggests that R. pachyptila acquires its symbionts through its environment. In fact, 16S rRNA gene analysis showed that vestimentiferan tubeworms belonging to three different genera: Riftia, Oasisia, and Tevnia, share the same bacterial symbiont phylotype. This proves that R. pachyptila takes its symbionts from a free-living bacterial population in the environment. Other studies also support this thesis, because analyzing R. pachyptila eggs, 16S rRNA belonging to the symbiont was not found, showing that the bacterial symbiont is not transmitted by vertical transfer. Another proof to support the environmental transfer comes from several studies conducted in the late 1990s. PCR was used to detect and identify a R. pachyptila symbiont gene whose sequence was very similar to the fliC gene that encodes some primary protein subunits (flagellin) required for flagellum synthesis. Analysis showed that R. pachyptila symbiont has at least one gene needed for flagellum synthesis. Hence, the question arose as to the purpose of the flagellum. Flagellar motility would be useless for a bacterial symbiont transmitted vertically, but if the symbiont came from the external environment, then a flagellum would be essential to reach the host organism and to colonize it. Indeed, several symbionts use this method to colonize eukaryotic hosts. Thus, these results confirm the environmental transfer of R. pachyptila symbiont.  Reproduction  R. pachyptila is a dioecious vestimentiferan. Individuals of this species are sessile and are found clustered together around deep-sea hydrothermal vents of the East Pacific Rise and the Galapagos Rift. The size of a patch of individuals surrounding a vent is within the scale of tens of metres. The male's spermatozoa are thread- shaped and are composed of three distinct regions: the acrosome (6 Œºm), the nucleus (26 Œºm) and the tail (98 Œºm). Thus, the single spermatozoa is about 130 Œºm long overall, with a diameter of 0.7 Œºm, which becomes narrower near the tail area, reaching 0.2 Œºm. The sperm is arranged into an agglomeration of around 340-350 individual spermatozoa that create a torch-like shape. The cup part is made up of acrosomes and nucleus, while the handle is made up by the tails. The spermatozoa in the package are held together by fibrils. Fibrils also coat the package itself to ensure cohesion. The large ovaries of females run within the gonocoel along the entire length of the trunk and are ventral to the trophosome. Eggs at different maturation stages can be found in the middle area of the ovaries, and depending on their developmental stage, are referred to as: oogonia, oocytes, and follicular cells. When the oocytes mature, they acquire protein and lipid yolk granules. Males release their sperm into sea water. While the released agglomerations of spermatozoa, referred to as spermatozeugmata, do not remain intact for more than 30 seconds in laboratory conditions, they may maintain integrity for longer periods of time in specific hydrothermal vent conditions. Usually, the spermatozeugmata swim into the female's tube. Movement of the cluster is conferred by the collective action of each spermatozoon moving independently. Reproduction has also been observed involving only a single spermatozoon reaching the female's tube. Generally, fertilization in R. pachyptila is considered internal. However, some argue that, as the sperm is released into sea water and only afterwards reaches the eggs in the oviducts, it should be defined as internal- external. R. pachyptila is completely dependent on the production of vulcanic gases and the presence of sulfide-oxidizing bacteria. Therefore, its metapopulation distribution is profoundly linked to vulcanic and tectonic activity that create active hydrothermal vent sites with a patchy and ephemeral distribution. The distance between active sites along a rift or adjacent segments can be very high, reaching hundreds of km. This raises the question regarding larval dispersal. R. pachytpila is capable of larval dispersal across distances of 100 to 200 km and cultured larvae show to be viable for 38 days. Though dispersal is considered to be effective, the genetic variability observed in R. pachyptila metapopulation is low compared to other vent species. This may be due to high extinction events and colonization events, as R. pachyptila is one of the first species to colonize a new active site. The endosymbionts of R. pachyptila are not passed to the fertilized eggs during spawning, but are acquired later during the larval stage of the vestimentiferan worm. R. pachyptila planktonic larvae that are transported through sea-bottom currents until they reach active hydrothermal vents sites, are referred to as trophocores. The trophocore stage lacks endosymbionts, which are acquired once larvae settle in a suitable environment and substrate. Free-living bacteria found in the water column are ingested randomly and enter the worm through a ciliated opening of the branchial plume. This opening is connected to the trophosome through a duct that passes through the brain. Once the bacteria are in the gut, the ones that are beneficial to the individual, namely sulfide- oxidizing strains are paghocytized by epithelial cells found in the midgut and are then retained. Bacteria that do not represent possible endosymbionts are digested. This raises questions as to how R. pachyptila manages to discern between essential and nonessential bacterial strains. The worm's ability to recognise a beneficial strain, as well as preferential host-specific infection by bacteria have been both suggested as being the drivers of this phenomenon. Growth rate and age R. pachyptila has the fastest growth rate of any known marine invertebrate. These organisms have been known to colonize a new site, grow to sexual maturity, and increase in length to 4.9 feet (1.5 m) in less than two years. Because of the peculiar environment in which R. pachyptila thrives, this species differs greatly from other deep-sea species that do not inhabit hydrothermal vents sites; the activity of diagnostic enzymes for glycolisis, citric acid cycle and transport of electrons in the tissues of R.pachyptila is very similar to the activity of these enzymes in the tissues of shallow-living animals. This contrasts with the fact that deep-sea species usually show very low metabolic rates, which in turn suggests that low water temperature and high pressure in the deep sea do not necessarily limit the metabolic rate of animals and that hydrothermal vents sites display characteristics that are completely different from the surrounding environment, thereby shaping the physiology and biological interactions of the organisms living in these sites.

Early life and career Peterson was born in Prentice, Wisconsin, and enlisted in the Navy on December 8, 1920. After his initial training, he spent his entire Navy career of over twenty years on sea duty aboard various ships. He and his wife Lola had two sons, Fred and Donald. By the United States' entry into World War II, Peterson had achieved the rank of chief watertender. He was assigned to the , an oiler ship operating in the Pacific theater. Battle of the Coral Sea On May 7, 1942, during the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Neosho was heavily damaged by Japanese dive bombers. In one bombing raid, Peterson and members of the repair party he led were severely wounded. Despite his injuries, he managed to close four bulkhead steam line valves, but suffered third-degree burns to his face, shoulders, arms and hands in the process. By shutting the valves, Peterson isolated the steam to the engine room and helped keep the ship operational. The Neosho was eventually scuttled on May 11 by gunfire from the destroyer USS Henley. The Henley had taken aboard 123 survivors from the Neosho.USS Neosho (AO-23) USS Henley (DD-391)Peterson died of his burn injuries on May 13 and was buried at sea, several hundred miles off the coast of Australia. For his actions during the battle, Peterson was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor later that year, on December 7. For unknown reasons, his family did not receive his medal in a formal presentation ceremony as was typical. Instead, the medal and accompanying certificate were mailed to his widow. Peterson's official Medal of Honor citation reads: > For extraordinary courage and conspicuous heroism above and beyond the call > of duty while in charge of a repair party during an attack on the U.S.S. > Neosho by enemy Japanese aerial forces on 7 May 1942. Lacking assistance > because of injuries to the other members of his repair party and severely > wounded himself, Peterson, with no concern for his own life, closed the > bulkhead stop valves and in so doing received additional burns which > resulted in his death.

Established in 1956, it is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Since at least the late 1960s, the University of Dallas has been ranked by some commentators as a leading university for both Catholic orthodoxy and traditional academic excellence. William F. Buckley, Brad Miner, and Pat Buchanan are just a few of the American conservative leaders who have spoken at UD over the years. Additionally, 80% of 2010 graduates participated in international programs, which is the sixth highest percentage of students from any higher education institution in the US to study abroad. The university comprises four academic units: the Braniff Graduate School of Liberal Arts, the Constantin College of Liberal Arts, the Satish & Yasmin Gupta College of Business, and the School of Ministry. Dallas offers several master's degree programs and a doctoral degree program with three concentrations. There are 136 full-time faculty and 102 part-time faculty. History The University of Dallas' charter dates from 1910 when the Western Province of the Congregation of the Mission (Vincentians) renamed Holy Trinity College in Dallas, which they had founded in 1905. The provincial of the Western Province closed the university in 1928, and the charter reverted to the Diocese of Dallas. In 1955, the Western Province of the Sisters of Saint Mary of Namur obtained it to create a new higher education institution in Dallas that would subsume their junior college, Our Lady of Victory College, located in Fort Worth. The sisters, together with Eugene Constantin, Jr. and Edward R. Maher, Sr., petitioned the Diocese of Dallas to sponsor the university, though ownership was entrusted to a self-perpetuating independent board of trustees. The University character was defined from its first day as being quite unlike the other Catholic universities of Texas and in fact unlike most Catholic colleges nationwide because of the understanding in Bishop Gorman of what a great University was supposed to be. This understanding came in great part from his own education in Europe between the wars at the Louvain, the Catholic University in Belgium often thought to be the greatest Catholic University in the world. \\"Bishop Gorman, as chancellor of the new university, announced that it would be a Catholic coeducational institution welcoming students of all faiths and races and offering work on the undergraduate level, with a graduate school to be added as soon as possible. The new University of Dallas opened to ninety-six students in September 1956 on a 1,000-acre tract of rolling hills northwest of Dallas.\\" The Sisters of Saint Mary of Namur, monks from the Order of Cistercians (Cistercians), friars from the Order of Friars Minor (Franciscans), and several lay professors formed the university's original faculty. The Franciscans departed three years later; however, friars from the Order of Preachers (Dominicans) joined the faculty in 1958 and built St. Albert the Great Priory on campus. The Cistercians established Our Lady of Dallas Abbey in 1958 and Cistercian Preparatory School in 1962, which are both adjacent to campus. The School Sisters of Notre Dame arrived in 1962 and opened the Notre Dame Special School for children with learning difficulties in 1963 and a motherhouse for the Dallas Province in 1964, which were both on campus. The sisters moved the school to Dallas in 1985 and closed the motherhouse in 1987. The faculty now is almost exclusively lay and includes several distinguished scholars. A grant from the Blakley-Braniff Foundation established the Braniff Graduate School in 1966 and allowed the construction of the Braniff Graduate Center. The Constantin Foundation similarly endowed the undergraduate college, and, in 1970, the Board of Trustees named the undergraduate college the Constantin College of Liberal Arts. The Graduate School of Management, begun in 1966, offers a large MBA program. Programs in art and English also began in 1966. In 1973, the Institute of Philosophic Studies, the doctoral program of the Braniff Graduate School and an outgrowth of the Kendall Politics and Literature Program, was initiated. The School of Ministry began in 1987. The College of Business, incorporating the Gupta Graduate School of Management and undergraduate business, opened in 2003. Since the first class in 1960, university graduates have won significant honors, including 39 Fulbright awards. Accreditation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools came in 1963 and has been reaffirmed regularly. In 1989, it was the youngest higher education institution to ever be awarded a Phi Beta Kappa chapter. The university briefly considered a large expansion into adult education in 2017. That idea proved unpopular with many faculty and was shelved. President Keefe was hired from Benedictine University. Like his predecessors, he quickly ran into controversy as he oversaw efforts to adapt the way the University operates to those associated with more conventional American Catholic colleges and universities. In 2017, his leadership was strongly and publicly challenged by over half the faculty and thousands of alumni members of an independent alumni group called UD Alumni for Liberal Education. Their complaint was over a proposal to add a new college within the university that it was believed would have watered down standards. After almost nonstop controversy and multiple efforts by Trustees to rein in the controversies, on Good Friday of 2018, after an extended and unexplained absence from work, the university's trustees voted to fire Thomas W. Keefe as university president effective at the end of the academic year. = The Role of the Cistercians = Bishop Thomas Gorman wrote as early as 1954 to Fr. Anselm Nagy, O. Cist. to ask the displaced Hungarian Cistercian fathers from the Monastery of Zirc, Hungary to come assist in founding the University. On the first day of classes in September 1956, 9 Cistercian fathers, half the entire faculty, were employed at this new University. Led by Father Anselm Nagy, these refugees from Communist Hungary brought with them a level of education that a brand new college in the Protestant south could not even have imagined possible. And the history of UD to this day is greatly connected to both those founding Cistercian priests and the many more Hungarians who would move to Dallas over the next decade and begin teaching at UD. The founding UD Faculty including the 9 Cistercian Fathers from Zirc, Hungary. In a 2008 interview for the magazine of the Cistercian Prep School, longtime UD employee, Sybil Novinski said \\"To be able to start a university with bright, educated monks, with traditions reaching back to the 11th century, was just amazing. The university‚Äôs intellectual reach and aspirations were strongly influenced by the Cistercians, and everyone knew that, even back then.\\" The first Academic Dean of UD, Dr. Gene Curtsinger said \\"I‚Äôm sure we could have made it without them. We just would have been a lot dumber and slower. They were an amazing group of men.\\" = Donald and Louise Cowan = In the spring of 1959, Louise and Donald Cowan were recruited to come bring their teaching excellence to the English and Physics departments respectively. In a 2006 speech, Louise Cowan related the encounter this way: \\"When this University was completing its third year, and Gene Constantin, Ed Maher, Bishop Gorman, and Msgr. Maher took Don and me to dinner, confiding in us their hopes for this new institution that they, along with the Sisters of Mary of Namur, had founded. They wanted it to make a difference in America and the world. We saw that we shared with them a piety toward the ideals of our nation (a cast of mind already becoming rare) and a conviction that we were witnessing the end of a long cultural era. We all agreed that the hope for our national ideals and indeed the world lay in American education. Further, like them, we held the conviction that not a college, but only a very fine university, even if small, could make any difference in the nation‚Äôs educational scheme.\\" Louise Cowan described that unique curriculum that defined UD this way in the same 2006 speech to faculty \\"We conceived of a Catholic university as an opportunity for generosity on the part of the Church‚Äîthe great texts from the past having been preserved in a Christian culture and now in danger again of being lost, a treasure trove as definite as the collection of art in the Vatican museum. And this meant, of course, that we conceived of a Catholic university‚Äôs chief task as educational, not specifically religious. We all agreed‚Äîthe Bishop too, who had earned a doctoral degree at Louvain‚Äîthat the kind of liberal learning that had developed ex corde ecclesia was something the Church could offer a world much in need of it.\\" \\"Assured that we would have freedom to plan a curriculum if we came here, Don and I imagined what could be done with Catholic higher education. If we did cast our lot in with this new school, we made clear, it would have to be a real university‚Äìone dedicated to liberal learning for all its students. The world did not need another moderately good college. We were eager to develop innovative programs that would give an entire school a genuine education, for we felt sure that such a curriculum would ignite sparks, spread into a kind of firestorm, and eventually illumine an entire nation. We had converted to Catholicism in 1956 and had both taught at Vanderbilt University before coming to TCU. Our ideas of education had been shaped by our friendship with the Southern Agrarians, along with study of Newman, Dawson, Maritain, Gilson, and intense reading in the brilliant theology of the forties and fifties‚Äîde Lubac, Guardini, Sertillanges, Rahner, John Courtney Murray‚Äîas well as C.S. Lewis and T.S. Eliot. All these writers were concerned with the relation of truth to culture. And all recognized that the culture we took for granted was in decline.\\" Louise Cowan was hired that summer to run the English department and in that role she designed the Literary Tradition sequence of four courses which is at the heart of the text based core curriculum which developed in those first few years of the 1960s and which would go on to define a UD education thenceforth. Donald Cowan was also hired in 1959 to teach Physics. At the end of the sixth year of the University, when the school's prominent though controversial 2nd President, Robert Morris, left UD, Dr. Donald Cowan was asked by the Board of Trustees to become the President of the college. From 1962 to his resignation in 1977, Donald Cowan was both the leader of UD and its defining force. With his wife's charismatic personality and his collaboration with the Board of Trustees, the University of Dallas became a nationally prominent school especially in the world of classical learning and orthodox Catholic belief. \\"Under Donald Cowan, the university set its mission as a place of intellectual inquiry rooted in Catholic philosophy and a spiritual world view\\" In their years together at UD, the Cowans cultivated relationships among Dallas' rich and powerful citizens very well. Though some occasionally considered the reverence given to the Cowans by high society to be a little too strong, few would dispute that the Cowans left a mark both on the college and on Dallas society that lasted long after their official leadership ended in the late 1970s. After the resignation of Don Cowan in 1977, there was a period of about a decade where the Cowans did not have any role at UD, but they returned in 1989 and Louise resumed to teaching a class in the Russian Novel and advising graduate students in the Braniff Graduate School. Donald Cowan was less visible in those years leading up to his death in 2002. Louise continued to speak and interact with students at UD almost up to her death at 98 years old on November 16, 2015. Governance and leadership The current President is Thomas S. Hibbs, an American philosopher who previously chaired the philosophy department at Boston College and served as Dean of the Honors College at Baylor University. Hibbs is an alumnus of the University of Dallas and the University of Notre Dame. The University of Dallas is governed by a board of trustees, which is currently chaired by Thomas Zellers, MD. According to the university's by- laws, the Bishop of Dallas is an ex-officio voting member. Edward Burns, Bishop of the Diocese of Dallas, currently serves as the chancellor. The office, held by a Catholic bishop per the constitution of the university, is an unpaid, honorary position.

The university is located in Irving, Texas on a 744-acre (301 hectare) campus in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. The Las Colinas development is nearby. It is 10 miles (16 km) from downtown Dallas. The campus consists mostly of mid-century modernist, earth-toned brick buildings set amidst the native Texas landscape. Several of these buildings were designed by the well-known Texas architect O'Neil Ford (dubbed the Godfather of Texas modernism).See Mary Carolyn Hollers George, O'Neil Ford, Architect (College Station, Tex.: Texas A&M; University Press, 1992), 154, 236, 238.

SB Hall on the University of Dallas campus, seen with the Braniff Tower in the background Braniff Graduate Center designed by O'Neil Ford Perhaps reflecting prevailing biases against mid-century modern architecture, the Princeton Review once mentioned the University of Dallas as having the fourth-least beautiful campus among the America's top colleges and universities, along with several other campuses with abundant modern architecture. Travel + Leisure's October 2013 issue lists it as one of America's ugliest college campuses, citing its \\"low-profile, boxy architecture that bears uncanny resemblance to a public car park,\\" but noting that a recent $12 million donation from alumni Satish and Yasmin Gupta would bring new campus construction.\\"America's Ugliest College Campuses\\", Travel + Leisure, October 2013 A Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) Orange-Line light rail station opened near campus on July 30, 2012.

The university's \\"Core Curriculum\\" is a collection of approximately twenty courses (two years) of common study covering philosophy, theology, history, literature, politics, economics, mathematics, science, art, and a foreign language. The curriculum not only includes a slate of required courses, but includes specific standardized texts, which permit professors to assume a common body of knowledge and speak across disciplines. Classes in these core subjects typically have an average class size of 16 students to permit frequent discussion. Dallas is one of 25 schools graded \\"A\\" by the American Council of Trustees and Alumni for a solid core curriculum. There is a similar Core Curriculum for graduate studies in the Braniff Graduate School of Liberal Arts. =Departments= Constantin College of Liberal Arts *Department of Classics (includes Philology, Greek, and Latin) *Department of English *Department of History *Department of Modern Languages (includes French, German, Italian, and Spanish) *Department of Philosophy *Department of Theology *Department of Biology *Department of Chemistry *Department of Mathematics *Department of Physics *Department of Economics *Department of Politics *Department of Psychology *Department of Art and Art History *Department of Drama *Department of Music *Department of Education Braniff Graduate School of Liberal Arts *Institute for Philosophic Studies (Note that departments in Constantin College also teach graduate courses for Braniff.)

Rome Program In 1970, the university started its own study abroad program in which Dallas students, generally sophomores, spend a semester at its campus southeast of Rome in the Alban Hills along the Via Appia. In June 1994, the property was renovated (12 acres [4.86 hectares]) and dedicated as the Eugene Constantin Rome Campus. It includes a library, a chapel, housing, a dining hall, classrooms, a tennis court, a bocce court, a swimming pool, an outdoor Greco-Roman theater, working vineyards, and olive groves. =Graduate programs= Braniff Graduate School of Liberal Arts The Braniff Graduate Center on the campus of the University of Dallas, one of the buildings designed by Texas architect O'Neil Ford.The Braniff Graduate School of Liberal Arts administers master's degrees in American studies, art, English, humanities, philosophy, politics, psychology, and theology, as well as an interdisciplinary doctoral program with concentrations in English, philosophy, and politics. Satish & Yasmin Gupta College of Business The University of Dallas Satish and Yasmin Gupta College of Business is an AACSB-accredited business school offering a part- time MBA program for working professionals, a Master of Science program, a Doctor of Business Administration (DBA), Graduate Certificates, graduate preparatory programs, and professional development courses.

The goal of the series is to build a library that will represent the whole breadth and variety of medieval civilization. The series is open-ended; as of May, 2016, it has published 21 volumes. =Haggerty Art Village= The University of Dallas Braniff Graduate School of Liberal Arts features a small, graduate art program, located in what is called Haggerty Art Village. Haggerty Art Village is separated from the rest of campus by a wooded grove, and the social atmosphere around the village is considerably different from the rest of the university. One notable feature of the graduate art program is that it provides all accepted graduates a full tuition scholarship, allowing them to study for three years and receive both their MA and MFA degrees. Offerings Haggerty Art Village itself features printmaking (all forms, plus papermaking and letterpress studios), painting, sculpture (well-equipped and spacious woodworking and metalworking studios), and ceramics facilities, though graduate students are not bound to a single medium, and receive their degree as a broader \\"art\\" classification (despite this, students are required to choose an adviser, based on which medium they might employ the most). There is also a Mac lab for digital photography and web design seminars. The program is small and intimate, and allows students to exhibit work both on and off campus. University of Dallas MFA candidates typically go on to successful artistic careers nationwide, and students come from a variety of backgrounds (there have also been numerous international students). Each student receives a private studio space in a collective studio environment. At this time, there are 16 graduate art students, indicative of the competitive nature of the acceptance process. In addition to flexible studio art courses and independent studio work, graduate art students are required to fulfill numerous art seminar credits, as well as take four art history courses throughout their time at UD (modern and contemporary art, plus two others; many students choose to create their own independent coursework). Because the UD art faculty are linked to the Dallas - Ft. Worth arts community, there are often graduate field trips to various Dallas - Ft. Worth art institutions, such as the Nasher Sculpture Center, the Dallas Museum of Art, the Modern in Ft. Worth, and several others. Beatrice Haggerty The University's gallery is named after Beatrice Haggerty who was influential in forming the Art Village. Haggerty's involvement with the art program emerged from a personal need when her daughter Kathleen was seriously injured in an auto accident. The Haggerty gift of the first art building in 1960 was engineered for her therapy. At the time Dallas was not highly developed, so Haggerty suggested to her husband Patrick E. Haggerty that the new university could benefit by a small building for sculpture. In return, their daughter had access to the needed therapeutic work. Giving an alternative opportunity of recovery for her daughter, Beatrice Haggerty simultaneously cultivated partnerships and future opportunity for the university's art program to flourish. After the completion of the Patrick and Beatrice Haggerty Museum of Art in Wisconsin, Haggerty again donated to fund the building of the first art building at the University of Dallas in 1960. It is currently one of six structures that make up the Haggerty Art Village. In 1994 a ‚ÄúBelong, Believe, Become‚Äù campaign was launched to fund the completion of the entire art village. Haggerty promised the ‚Äúseed money,‚Äù remarking: ‚ÄúI would like to see the art center finished.‚Äù The funds would renovate the older art buildings and add a multipurpose art history building, a new sculpture facility, and an art foundations building. This donation served the first part of the 125 million dollar campus wide aid campaign. The original investments of the Haggerty family helped to establish a respectful, healthy, safe environment that promotes the values of quality and creativity in the visual communication of artist and their art. As a prominent member of gardening clubs and possessing an eye for aesthetic landscaping, Beatrice advocated to uphold the natural beauty of the campus‚Äô trees and to maintain an environment for all artists to find inspiration. Currently, the exhibitions in the Beatrice M. Haggerty Gallery are designed to encourage a dialogue between the University of Dallas and the broader artistic community by inviting an array of contemporary artists, both national and international, to the university's campus. O'Neil Ford Buildings The first University of Dallas art building was completed in 1960 through the benevolence of Mr. and Mrs. Patrick E. Haggerty. The objective was to create a space that would allow artists to be cultivated and challenged. Designed by O'Neil Ford and his firm Ford, Powell and Carson of San Antonio, the associated architects Landry and Landry of Dallas, the building is separate from the rest of campus by a wooded grove. Using simple materials, the building features both exhibition and gathering spaces with high ceilings and natural light. To further encourage the making of art, the building includes three, semi private studios. This first building was opened in 1960 and was dedicated by the Bishop of Dallas, most Reverend Thomas K. Gorman, and attended by Sr.Mary Corita Kent, renowned contemporary print-maker from Immaculate Heart College in Los Angeles In 1965, the University of Dallas welcomed its second art building designed by Ford. This building provided studios and a frame shop for both painting and printmaking studios. In 1975, a third art building designed by Ford was established. The space was created for both ceramics and graduate studios. Additionally, the building served as a printmaking expansion, drawing room, and art history classroom and kiln shed. These buildings were the first of six structures to form the Haggerty Art Village. O'Neil Ford also designed the main buildings on the Mall of the university. Those buildings, built thanks to the large gift in 1964 from Mr. Blakely and Mr. Braniff, and the tower on the end of the mall built later were designed by Mr. Ford to be both typical of the architecture of the American Southwest and were built using stronger and more durable building methods than most modern construction. A view of the printmaking studios through a grove of trees, Haggerty Art Village, University of Dallas, Texas Galleries Haggerty Art Village features the Upper Gallery, which can be merged for one, large exhibition, or separated into two distinct exhibitions. The Upper Gallery is fully equipped with track lighting and movable walls. Many students show in the Upper Gallery for their MA on-campus exhibitions. In addition to the Upper Gallery, there is a small studio space gallery, which usually shows group exhibitions featuring recent graduate work. The art history building features the Beatrice M. Haggerty Gallery, which hosts an eclectic array of exhibits, featuring works by artists from around the United States and the rest of the world. There are other places outside of the Art Village to show work: Gorman Lecture Center Foyer is commonly used, as is the Braniff Lounge (called \\"the fishbowl\\" by students for its many windows and natural light). National Print Invitational Started by Juergen Strunck in 1974, the National Print Invitational was an annual exhibit that allowed printmakers from all over the US to share their work without paying entry fees. With no fee, a couple hundred submissions were narrowed down to roughly 50 by the university printmaking graduate students. After the initial $2000 university funding was spent and not replenished, continued fundraising was mostly accomplished through membership fees: for $200 a year, members received a print as well as funded future exhibits.Interview with Juergen Strunck With Strunck‚Äôs retirement, the National Print Invitational ended after many successful years of supporting not only artists in the immediate community, but nationally as well. Hardcopies of all invites are located in the Matrix and Printmaking Collection in the Beatrice M. Haggerty Gallery, with the exception of the first NPI, which does not have an invite. Matrix Program The Matrix Program invites visiting artists from around the country. It allows students to print an edition of that artist's work. Artists have included Endi E. Poskovic. Students who participate in printing the edition typically receive a finished, numbered print to add to their personal print collection. Matrix donors feature several citizens of the Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth metroplex community appreciative of the arts. For their donations, they receive a print by every other Matrix artist (Matrix artists are divided into \\"small edition\\" and \\"large edition\\" semesters; donors receive \\"large edition\\" prints). The program also features a student-curated exhibition of the artists' work, complete with an opening reception and an artist demo session. NCECA Conference The University of Dallas was the local sponsor for the National Council on Education for the Ceramic Arts' (NCECA) 32nd annual Conference in 1998 with the central theme of ‚ÄúHeroes, Icons, History, Memory.‚Äù The University‚Äôs Dan Hammett acted as the Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth Onsite Conference Chair and has served the organization in various capacities for seventeen years.Interview with Lyle Novinski. \\"Notes on the History of the Art Department Graduate Program\\". 2017. pp. 22 A Clay Traditions exhibition appeared in conjunction with the March Conference, promoting the mission of ceramic education. Instructors from various institutions combined the different roles of teacher and artist, providing a cross section of contemporary work in clay. The University started the ceramic exhibition and elevated the Conference's visibility through exhibitions and P.B.S. style films released throughout the country. In all, three exhibitionsInterview with Lyle Novinski. \\"Notes on the History of the Art Department Graduate Program\\". 2017. pp. 20 were presented on the campus to make available the visual icons of the organization to students. Hammett mounted the work of Professor Harding Black, a regionally respected Texas artist, in upstairs Haggar; the work of Maria Martinez, an artist from New Mexico; and a national Student Competition in the University Gallery in Haggar which no longer exists. On the Irving Campus by the Madonna Pond, the Constantin Arch serves as a continuing testament to the organization. Designer Robert Harrison constructed the brick, cement, steel, and ceramic tile structure over four days with University art professors, Dan Hammett and Cameron Schoepp, and students.\\"University of Dallas Magazine\\" Spring/Summer 1998, pp. 8 Hammett's position on the national Board of NCECA has been beneficial for the Graduate and undergraduate ceramic students, whom he takes to the national Conference each year. The Celebration of Japanese Arts The university agreed to house one of the most renowned and respected swordsmiths in Japan in the spring of 1980. Master Yoshindo Yoshihara hoped to come to the United States and demonstrate how blades were forged and ultimately produce the first Samurai blades forged in the Western Hemisphere. In the early spring of 1980, the garden between the art buildings was transformed into a Japanese setting with plants and a gravel surface to welcome the guests. The project began on Holy Saturday, after the lighting of the fire of sacramental order. Yoshihara, inside the Kaji-Ba, struck the first fire with flint and steel at the forge, and began with raw ore that had been transported from Japan. Along with Yoshihara and his assistants there was also a hibaki maker, grinder, and a polisher. The scabbard and hibaki makers sat on tatami mats inside the sculpture studio, which is currently the printmaking studio at the university. 16 blades were completed, and three from raw ore. One is in the Metropolitan, one in Boston, and the third in on the University of Dallas Campus. A week long Shinsa was offered in upstairs Haggar. Here the blades made by Yoshihara were evaluated and approved for transportation. Along with the smithing, The Samurai Sword Museum in Kyoto offered to send an exhibition of spear heads, blades, kutani, and Tsuba. The University also housed an exhibition of Japanese ceramics in the Art building. The blades were displayed in the University Gallery, located then where the student life offices are now. They were considered so valuable that they were guarded during the day. So precious were they that no catalogue or identifying labels were permitted. The oldest was 10th century. Also offered in the Campus wide Celebration of the Japanese Arts was a tea ceremony, flower arranging, and kite flying. Among the UD Community Education programs was an eight-week instructional class on \\"Beginning Ikebana Japanese Floral Art\\" along with a four-week lecture series on \\"Zen and Contemporary American Literature\\" and an eight-week lecture series on \\"Treasures of Japanese Civilization.\\" A 30-minute, 16mm film ‚ÄúSamurai‚Äù was made by Lowell Jordan that shows the process of the forging of the blades on the University campus. The film was shown on PBS and also won a silver medal at an International film Festival. =Media= The University of Dallas' student-ran media is diverse. The student newspaper is The University News, published weekly on Wednesdays both in-print and online. The yearbook, first published in 1957, is The Crusader. Ramify, the official journal of the Braniff Graduate School of Liberal Arts, has been published since 2009 to showcase \\"serious but jargon-free intellectual treatments\\" on subjects of the liberal arts. OnStage Magazine has been operated by the Drama Department since 2016. The Mockingbird, a student-ran and student-funded publication, began monthly printing in September 2020. Since 2011, the Phi Beta Kappa liberal arts honor society has published the University Scholar once a semester to showcase the \\"undergraduate writing, comprising essays, short stories, poems, and scientific abstracts\\" of the university's undergraduates. The Office of Advancement publishes Tower Magazine for alumni on a regular basis, usually once in Summer and once in Winter. =Residence life= On campus residency is required of all students who have not yet attained senior status or who are under 21 and are not married, not a veteran of the military, or who do not live with their parents or relatives in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. These requirements change from year to year depending upon the size of the incoming freshman class; for instance, in 2009, all students with senior credit standing were required to live off campus. Freshmen live in traditional single-sex halls, while upperclassmen live either in the University's co-ed dormitory or off-campus. There are five traditional halls for freshmen students. Jerome, Augustine and Gregory halls are all-female halls. These halls were last renovated in 1998, 1995, and 2014 respectively. Theresa and Madonna halls are all-male halls. These halls were renovated in 2000 and 1999 respectively. Clark Hall is the only co-ed dormitory and was built in 2010. The final hall is O'Connell Hall. Renovated in 2010, O'Connell Hall housing is based upon campus population housing needs for any given year. This hall may house new students, continuing students or a combination of both by floor if necessary. =Cost of Attendance= The cost of attendance for the University of Dallas is dependent on the student's commuter status. For an on-campus student, the cost of attendance for the 2019-2020 school year is $59,600. For an off-campus resident in Texas, the cost of attendance for the 2019-2020 school year is $55,640. For a student living with parents or relatives, the cost of attendance for the 2019-2020 school year is $51,340.  Controversies  = Guadalupe art print scandal = On February 14, 2008 an image of Our Lady of Guadalupe was removed without permission from the Upper Gallery of the Haggerty Art Village. The image, entitled \\"Saint or Sinner\\", was on loan from Murray State University in Kentucky as part of a larger exhibit of works by Murray State University students. The piece reportedly portrayed the Virgin Mary as a stripper. Immediate responses to the piece by students when it went on display were largely negative; to appease concerns, signage was put up warning students that \\"some items [on display] might be considered offensive.\\" Responding to the incident, President Frank Lazarus released the following statement: \\"By committing an intrinsically evil act before the administration has had a reasonable chance to formulate a response, this theft severely damages the prospects of dealing with this issue in a measured and rational manner as befits the dignity of a university community. Nevertheless, I will respond in a timely fashion to the substantive issues surrounding the display of this work of art in view of our Catholic character, our religious values, and the urgent question of the proper meaning of academic freedom.\\" Reaction to Dr. Lazarus' statement prompted heated campus discussion and faced negative reception from online Catholic & conservative tabloids. Opinions ranged from support of academic freedom to open hostility towards the university's administration and calls for the president to resign. Some Catholic students questioned whether the theft was actually an \\"intrinsically evil act\\", arguing that it was within the prerogative of a Catholic student to remove an image that desecrates the Mother of God.

Brewster arrived in British Columbia in 1893, and had various careers working on a ship and then in a cannery. He eventually became owner of his own canning company. He was elected to the provincial legislature in the 1907 election, and was one of only two Liberals elected to the legislature in the 1909 election. Brewster became leader of the opposition, and was elected party leader in March 1912. He lost his seat a few weeks later in the 1912 election, which returned no Liberals at all. In 1916, he won election to the legislature again through a by-election, and led his party to victory in a general election later that year by campaigning on a reform platform. Brewster promised to end patronage in the civil service, end political machines, improve workmen's compensation and labour laws, bring in votes for women, and other progressive reforms. In government, Carey brought in women's suffrage, instituted prohibition, and combatted political corruption before his unexpected death in 1918.

It was directed by veteran anime director Osamu Dezaki and features character designs by Akio Sugino. The series aired from September 8, 1984 to December 15, 1984 on Saturday mornings in the United States on ABC. Series history Mighty Orbots was developed from an idea pitched by Fred Silverman, possibly in response to the popularity of other robot-related properties such as Hasbro and Sunbow's Transformers. The original six-minute \\"pilot\\" featured a slightly different version of Mighty Orbots called Broots (pronounced \\"Brutes\\"). Rob and Ohno looked similar to their 'finished' selves, though definitively more late 70s-like. The Orbots, while having the same names as in the finished product, are subtly different, and obviously unfinished. Even their combined form aka \\"Super-Broots\\" would go through some more developmental evolution before becoming Mighty Orbots. It was produced by Tokyo Movie Shinsha and Intermedia Entertainment in association with MGM/UA Television for both the United States for the television broadcast and Japan via home video. Unlike many other shows of its kind, Mighty Orbots was not simply a translated Japanese import. The series was directed by anime industry veteran Osamu Dezaki with storyboard work by Dezaki's brother Satoshi Dezaki, character designs by Akio Sugino, and animation by Shingo Araki. The main theme song used in the show introduction and throughout the series was created by Steve Rucker and Thomas Chase, with lead vocals provided by Warren Stanyer. The music was composed by Yuji Ohno. The series lasted only a single season of thirteen episodes, mostly due to a lawsuit between the show's creators and toymaker Tonka, who accused them of causing brand confusion with their GoBots franchise's \\"Mighty Robots, Mighty Vehicles\\" advertising campaign. The episodes aired on ABC and some episodes were later released on VHS by MGM/UA Home Video. Despite its short run, the series has a dedicated fan base today. The series' narration was done by voice-actor Gary Owens, who was the voice of Hanna-Barbera's Space Ghost in the 1960s and Dynomutt, Dog Wonder's human straight man Blue Falcon in the late 1970s. Series plot The 23rd Century, the future is a time of robots and aliens. The people of Earth have banded together along with several other peaceful alien races to promote peace throughout the galaxy, forming the United Planets. As part of the United Planets, the Galactic Patrol -- a body of law-enforcers -- works to maintain order, under the leadership of Commander Rondu. However, a powerful criminal organization called SHADOW is out to destroy both the Galactic Patrol and the U.P. Led by Lord Umbra, a massive cyborg-computer, SHADOW employs sinister agents and incredible schemes to attack and someday rule over all corners of the known-galaxy. There is one thing that helps to fight against SHADOW: ingenious inventor Rob Simmons -- secretly a member of the Galactic Patrol -- creates six special robots who can use their unique powers to battle against the forces of Umbra. Together, these robots can unite to form a giant robot called Mighty Orbots, to fight for truth, justice and peace for all. Mighty Orbots is one of only a small number of Saturday morning cartoons to have a definite series finale: the final episode, \\"Invasion of the Shadow Star,\\" ends with a sequence in which the SHADOW homeworld is destroyed and the arch- villain Umbra defeated \\"once and for all.\\" This differs from most other animated series, where the villain always escaped to fight another day. Characters =Hero characters= * Rob Simmons ‚Äì A brilliant inventor and scientist, he is the creator of Mighty Orbots and as such is also a secret member of the Galactic Patrol. In general, he poses as a mild-mannered robotics engineer and tinkers in his own laboratory complex (in some unnamed location) on Earth, but when needed, he uses a transformation matrix to change his regular lab clothes ‚Äì called an Omni-Suit ‚Äì into the uniform and helmet of his alter-ego, the Orbots' Commander. It is by this alternate persona that the rest of the Galactic Patrol knows of him publicly, including Dia. Only Commander Rondu knows that the bespectacled Rob and the heroic Orbots' Commander are the same. : Rob has curly blond hair and blue eyes. He can summon the Orbots from their recharge chambers with a remote signal from a device he wears on his wrist. He pilots the Beam Car; a special vehicle that acts as a \\"command center\\" when linked up within Mighty Orbots' core body. From there, he and Ohno can operate Mighty Orbots with maximum effectiveness in battle. : Voiced by Barry Gordon (English) and Y≈´ Mizushima (Japanese) * Commander Rondu ‚Äì The primary leader of the Galactic Patrol, Rondu is of a race of alien humanoids that somewhat resemble Earth humans (save he has slanted eyes and pointed ears, similar to archetypal fantasy elves; It could also be a reference to the Vulcan species from Star Trek). Rondu is a calm, wise leader and ‚Äì as it appears throughout the series ‚Äì has been in charge of the Galactic Patrol for many years. He serves along with his daughter, Dia, who serves as a senior officer. Only Rondu knows about the Orbots' Commander's secret identity, as well as the six robots (who apparently also have dual identities as well). : Rondu has long silver-white hair and facial hair, and grey-white eyes. He exhibits formidable psionic powers; something that must be key to his race (since a space pirate named Shrike wanted to use his \\"unique life-force\\" to power a super-weapon in the episode \\"Raid on the Stellar Queen\\"). : Voiced by Don Messick (English) and Shozo Hirabayashi (Japanese) * Dia ‚Äì A senior officer and agent of the Galactic Patrol, Dia serves under her father's command, and is considered one of the \\"top\\" agents on the force. She is a good starship pilot and warrior, but occasionally finds herself in jeopardy, needing to be rescued by Mighty Orbots. She has a fascination and apparent love-interest in the Orbots' Commander, but doesn't see his alter ego, Rob, as anything more than a good friend and fellow supporter for peace (she is unaware of the fact Rob and the Orbots' Commander are the same). : Dia has long, silver-white hair and dark eyes. Aside from being highly skilled in fighting, acrobatics and flying ships, Dia often captures agents of SHADOW in a force-field projector stored in a wrist band on her left arm. It is never said if she possesses the same psionic powers her father does. It is hinted at in \\"Operation: Eclipse\\", however, when she volunteers to aid her father in mental battle with Dreneon, who is a member of the same race working for Shadow. : Voiced by Jennifer Darling (English) and Atsuko Koganezawa (Japanese) =The Orbots= * Ohno ‚Äì The first robot of the team, so named for her propensity to exclaim \\"Oh no!\\" and quite possibly the most important of them all, Ohno resembles a small, female child in size and demeanor with the \\"mother hen\\" personality of a bossy little sister that can often get on the nerves of Rob and the others. Feisty, yet supportive in her role as Rob's assistant, Ohno helps keep the lab running and the rest of the team in line. At times she feels neglected and unappreciated, but through thick and thin she's always there to lend the team a hand (and a nag when needed). : Ohno's primary colors are pink, red and white. When Mighty Orbots forms its gestalt form, it's Ohno that completes the final circuit \\"link\\" that allows the full power of the giant robot form to come online. Without this vital piece, Mighty Orbots cannot become fully functional (a flaw that was exploited once by Umbra, under the machinations of the Shadow Agent called Plasmus, in the episode \\"The Wish World\\"). If necessary, Ohno can operate the controls alone for basic functions, but combat is simply too demanding without the Commander on board. Ohno also carries the repair tools and recharge kit needed should the Orbots be caught off-world away from their base recharge chambers. : Voiced by Noelle North (English) and Miki Ito (Japanese) * Tor ‚Äì A boastful, burly brute-sized male robot with a voice like Link Hogthrob, he is the strongest of the five team members. Although quite often portrayed as being a bit slow and with a very high opinion of himself, Tor had the ability to think on his feet during battles with SHADOW monsters and henchmen. Kind and supportive towards his friends although often with a good-naturedly egotistical macho attitude that annoys his female teammates, Tor sometimes is the de facto leader (when Rob ‚Äì as the Orbots Commander ‚Äì isn't leading them directly at the time), but he will take cues from the others when the situation merits it. : Tor's primary colors are silver, red and blue. When forming the gestalt form of Mighty Orbots, Tor retracts his arms and legs into himself to form the central body and head. : Voiced by Bill Martin (English) and Tessho Genda (Japanese) * Bort ‚Äì A gaunt-thin male robot with a nervous personality and a voice like Lou Costello, he is the one member of the team that is the most handy due having been built with quick-change circuits and other abilities that allow Bort to reconfigure himself into literally any machine or device he can think of. Often showing a lack of confidence in himself, Bort is portrayed as being clumsy, indecisive and self-depressive. Yet, when the chips are down, Bort always comes through in the clutch for his team. : Bort's primary colors are silver and blue. When forming the gestalt form of Mighty Orbots, he retracts into a boxy unit that forms the lower right leg. While connected, he can use his quick-change circuits to modify the hands of Mighty Orbots into a variety of offensive and defensive weapons. : Voiced by Jim MacGeorge and the late Ken Yamaguchi (Japanese) * Bo ‚Äì One of the three female robot team members she is most outgoing, assertive and confident female on the team. Sometimes she likes to play practical jokes, but at times they can backfire (like when she removed Crunch's appetite chip, only to have it broken when they needed it in the episode \\"Trapped on The Prehistoric Planet\\"). She is a caring soul and will do what she can to support her teammates. She has the ability to manipulate the elements ‚Äì fire, water, wind, etc. ‚Äì to use in a myriad of offensive and defensive effects (whirlwinds, water geysers, etc.). : Bo's primary colors are pale yellow and orange. When forming the gestalt form of Mighty Orbots, she transforms in the left arm, which forms a hand after it is connected to the main body. Through her connection, she can channel her elemental powers throughout the body of Mighty Orbots. : Voiced by Sherry Alberoni (English) and Akari Hibino (Japanese) * Boo ‚Äì The third female team member and twin sister to Bo, she is the shyest member of the team, yet she can prove to be as brave as her twin in combat, even standing up for herself and others (especially when Bo's pranks go too far). Boo has the ability to create and manipulate effects on light and energy that would appear to be \\"magic\\"; she can turn herself and others invisible, create force fields, levitate objects and even teleport. She can also channel energy to form optical illusions and holograms. : Boo's primary colors are white and yellow. When forming the gestalt form of Mighty Orbots, she transforms into the right arm of the giant robot. Like Bo, she can channel her defensive abilities throughout the larger body, allowing it to benefit from all of her \\"magic\\" effects. : Voiced by Julie Bennett (English) and Hitomi Oikawa (Japanese) * Crunch ‚Äì A stoutly robust (sic \\"chubby\\") male robot whose personality seems to be focused on one thing; simply put, Crunch loves to eat. His prime ability ‚Äì coupled with his steel trap-like jaws and teeth ‚Äì allows him to consume any materials available (metal, stone, glass, circuits, garbage, etc.) and digest it so it can be converted into energy. Often he's a subject of comic-relief due to his eating habits. Crunch seems simple-minded, but he does prove to have some brains, and is a good friend and a steadfast supportive personality. : Crunch's primary colors are purple and black. When forming the gestalt form of Mighty Orbots, Crunch forms a boxy unit that forms the lower left leg. While connected, Crunch also serves as the back-up power source for the giant robot, and at times will detach so he can consume on any available items to give his team mates a much-needed power boost. : Voiced by Don Messick (English) and Ikuya Sawaki (Japanese) =Villain characters= * Lord Umbra ‚Äì The leader of SHADOW, Umbra is a massive, bio-mechanical computer the size of a planet's core; often depicted as a large globe with a mouth, a vestigial nose and five eyes. It is through his efforts, organizing through his minions and agents, that Umbra strives to conquer the galaxy. Operating from inside a massive base called the Shadow Star, which is essentially a Dyson sphere, or a shell around a star that can capture all of the available light, his network of informants and spies keep him abreast of any developments within the United Planets. The weaponry and defensive systems of the Shadow Star are so ominous that a direct assault by Galactic Patrol forces is considered to be out of the question. The Shadow Star can generate so much power that it is able to move under Umbra's direction, and any sector of space it occupies will be totally under Shadow control. : Umbra himself has no real means of directly fighting his enemies, so he employs massive monsters, sinister aliens and elaborate plans to combat the threat of the Galactic Patrol and Mighty Orbots. * Draconis ‚Äì An agent of SHADOW, who works with Umbra in a diabolical plan to discredit and defeat the Orbots. He works with a duplicate, giant robot impostor, named Tobor, who resembles the assembled gestalt form of Mighty Orbots. Together, they first attack the peaceful peoples of the galaxy to make the Galactic Patrol believe that the Orbots have turned evil. Then, after the Orbots are put on trial and sentenced to 'life' on the Great Prison Planet, Draconis ‚Äì who had managed to infiltrate the prison and put himself as the chief warden ‚Äì would put the Orbots through grueling, demeaning and deadly tasks that would have destroyed them. However, Draconis and Tobor were exposed, and eventually defeated by Dia and the Orbots. * Capt. Shrike ‚Äì The leader of a gang of space pirates, Captain Shrike lashes out against unsuspecting ships and travelers from within the Sargasso Star Cluster; wherein lies his secret base. He battled Mighty Orbots after he hijacked a starliner, the Stellar-Queen, to use her hyperdrive engine along with the life-force of Commander Rondu to create a super weapon. : Shrike uses a cybernetic eye to control his Master Computer, as well as stun his foes with a stasis-ray. Using his Master Computer, Shrike used Rondu's life-force to create a creature called a Titan (which looked like a Japanese Oni), to battle Mighty Orbots. : Shrike was the only villain who was not a member of SHADOW. * Plasmus ‚Äì An alien shape-shifter, Plasmus was ordered by Umbra to find a weakness in Mighty Orbots so SHADOW could destroy them. Plasmus discovered that Ohno was a key to Mighty Orbots power, after he tricked her into traveling to the Wish World, where she was turned into a human girl. Plasmus later battled Mighty Orbots in the Emerald Nebula, in an attempt to defeat them, but was shoved into a hyper-warp and was never seen again. : Plasmus could change his shape to resemble any type of non-robotic life form. He mostly traveled as a mass of gaseous, green/white vapor, which is what appeared as he transformed. As well, he could draw upon energy and matter to enlarge his strength and mass exponentially.

While hamburger has become the most common meat on a horseshoe, the original meat was ham. The \\"horseshoe\\" name has been variously attributed to the horseshoe-like shape of a slice of bone-in ham, or to the horseshoe-like arrangement of potato wedges around the ham. It's not uncommon to substitute other meat for the hamburger, such as chicken or ham, or use more than one type of meat. The fries may also be substituted with tater tots, waffle fries, or other forms of fried potatoes. Though cheese sauces vary by chef, it is generally derived from Welsh rarebit. Common ingredients include eggs, stale beer, butter, sharp cheddar cheese, Worcestershire sauce, flour, dry mustard, paprika, salt and pepper, and a dash of cayenne pepper. A smaller portion, with one slice of bread and one serving of meat, is called a pony shoe. A breakfast horseshoe is also available. The hamburger and french fries are replaced with sausage or bacon, eggs, and hash browns. The cheese sauce can also be substituted with milk gravy. Ross' Restaurant in Bettendorf, Iowa is known for a similar dish called the Magic Mountain. Instead of a hamburger patty, the sandwich contains steamed loose-meat. It has been enjoyed by politicians and celebrities including Barack Obama and Bette Midler. The horsehoe was invented at the Leland Hotel in Springfield, but its inventorship has been the subject of controversy. The sandwich was created in 1928 by Leland Hotel chef Joe Schweska. His kitchen assistants included Tony Wables and Steve Tomko, who has also sometimes been credited as the inventor of the horseshoe and who served the horseshoe in his own restaurants later on. The Leland, located on the corner of Sixth and Capitol (now an office building), was one of Springfield's leading hotels. It was built in 1867 and has housed hundreds of prominent Americans. The structure is five stories high and contained 235 rooms. Chef Tomko also took his horseshoe recipe to the Red Coach Inn after leaving the Leland Hotel. In the 2015 Thomas' Breakfast Battle, hosted by Thomas' Breads, Mike Murphy won a $25,000 prize for his breakfast horseshoe. The contest featured chefs from throughout the country combining local flavor with Thomas' English muffins. Murphy's winning horseshoe included eggs, bacon, cheese sauce, sausage gravy and hash browns on top of the English muffin. He prepared the dish on an episode of Fox & Friends to promote the contest.

He established a one-party state, with his Mauritanian People's Party being the sole legal political entity in the country, and followed a policy of \\"Islamic socialism\\" with many nationalizations of private businesses; in foreign affairs, he joined the Non-Aligned Movement and maintained strong links with Mao Zedong and the People's Republic of China, but he also accepted Western (especially French) foreign aid.Jeremy Friedman, Shadow Cold War: The Sino-Soviet Competition for the Third World, 2015, p. 166 Background Ould Daddah was born to an important marabout family of the Ouled Birri tribe in Boutilimit, Mauritania, French West Africa. After attending elite Islamic academies, he worked for the French colonial administrators as a translator. As a law student in Paris, he graduated as the first Mauritanian to hold a university degree. He was later admitted to the bar at Dakar, Senegal in 1955. Upon his return to Mauritania in the late 1950s, Daddah joined the centre-left Mauritanian Progressive Union, and was elected President of its Executive Council. In 1959, however, he established a new political party, the Mauritanian Regroupment Party. In the last pre-independence legislative elections held later that year, his party won every seat in the National Assembly, and he was appointed Prime Minister. He was known for his ability to establish a consensus among different political parties, as well as between the White Moors, Black Moors and Black Africans, Mauritania's three main ethnic groups. The balanced representation of different ethnic and political groups in his government won the confidence of the French authorities, who granted independence to Mauritania under his leadership in 1960. Daddah was named Acting President of the new republic, and was confirmed in office in the first post-independence election in August 1961.  President of Mauritania  As President, Daddah pursued policies that differed markedly from those he had professed prior to independence. In September 1961, he formed a \\"government of national unity\\" with the main opposition party, and in December, he arranged for the four largest parties to merge as the Mauritanian People's Party (PPM), which became the sole legal party. He formalized the one-party state in 1964 with a new Constitution, which set up an authoritarian presidential regime. Daddah justified this decision on the grounds that he considered Mauritania unready for western-style multi-party democracy. Under this one-party constitution, Daddah was reelected in uncontested elections in 1966, 1971 and 1976. President Daddah with Mao Zedong in 1968. In 1971, Daddah served as President of the Organization of African Unity (OAU). At home, however, his policies were criticized. The economy remained strongly dependent on Chinese and French foreign aid. Moreover, drought in the Sahel, principally in the period between 1969 and 1974, and a decline in export revenues due to fall in international prices of iron, had lowered living standards considerably. In 1975, he presented a charter which called for Mauritania to become an \\"Islamic, nationalist, centralist, and socialist democracy.\\" This charter was initially popular, and the opposition, in general, welcomed it. On the 18th of July 1974, president Moktar Ould Daddah, who was on a state visit to Nigeria, paid a visit to Sultan Abubakar, a fellow Islamic scholar, and friend in the company of General Yakubu Gowon. War in Western Sahara What brought an end to Ould Daddah's regime was Mauritania's war in Western Sahara against the Polisario Front, an indigenous movement fighting against the Moroccan- Mauritanian attempt to jointly annex the territory, starting in 1975. Ould Daddah had claimed the territory as part of Greater Mauritania since 1957, three years before independence, but the idea had only limited support in the general population. The Mauritanian Moors are closely related to the Sahrawis, and virtually all northern tribes had members on both sides of the (former) frontier, many of whom sympathized with the Polisario's demands for independence. In addition to the government's support for guerrillas in northern Mauritania, several thousand Mauritanians left the country to join the Polisario in its Tindouf camps. Further dissatisfaction arose in the South, from where Black troops were sent to fight what they regarded as an essentially inter-Arab conflict, and one which could, if successful, entrench Ould Daddah's discriminatory rule even further by the addition of several thousand new Moorish citizens. But Ould Daddah additionally sought the territory in order to prevent it from falling into Moroccan hands, still wary of the officially defunct Moroccan territorial demands on Mauritania. Following the Madrid Accords with Spain, Mauritania annexed a southern portion of the territory, renaming it Tiris al-Gharbiya. However, the small and poorly trained Mauritanian army failed to stop the guerilla incursions, despite backing from the French Air Force. Polisario then turned to attacking the iron mines in Zouerate, at which point the country's economy started backsliding, and Daddah's public support tumbled. In 1976, the capital Nouakchott was attacked by the Polisario Front, and Daddah was forced to appoint a military officer to head the ministry of defence. Downfall and later life On 10 July 1978, Lt. Col. Mustafa Ould Salek ousted Daddah in a military coup, and installed a junta to rule the country in his place. His successors would surrender Mauritania's claims to Western Sahara and withdraw from the war the following year. After a period of imprisonment, Ould Daddah was allowed to go into exile in France in August 1979, where he organized an opposition group, the Alliance pour une Mauritanie Democratique (AMD) in 1980. Attempts to overthrow the regime from abroad were unsuccessful. Ould Daddah was allowed to return to Mauritania on 17 July 2001,\\"Ousted Mauritanian president due home from 23 years in exile\\". Agence France Presse, 17 July 2001. but died soon after at a military hospital, following a long illness, in Paris, France on 14 October 2003. His body was subsequently flown back to Mauritania, where it is buried.

Teikei is closely associated with small- scale, local, organic farming, and volunteer-based, non-profit partnerships between producers and consumers. Millions of Japanese consumers participate in teikei. It is widely cited as the origin of community-supported agriculture around the world. While there is some disagreement as to the \\"first\\" teikei group, the concept can be traced back to the mid-1960s, when a group of Japanese women banded together to purchase fresh milk. A general movement towards consumer-farmer partnerships in Japan in the late 1960s and early 1970s was driven by environmental issues and distrust of the quality of food in the conventional food system. One of the founding teikei groups, the Japan Organic Agriculture Association (JOAA), founded in 1971, describes teikei as \\"an idea to create an alternative distribution system, not depending on the conventional market. Though the forms of teikei vary, it is basically a direct distribution system. To carry it out, the producer(s) and the consumer(s) have talks and contact to deepen their mutual understanding: both of them provide labor and capital to support their own delivery system.... Teikei is not only a practical idea but also a dynamic philosophy to make people think of a better way of life either as a producer or as a consumer through their interaction.\\"Japan Organic Agriculture Association In the beginning there was \\"teikei\\" Teikei in Japanese means \\"cooperation\\", \\"joint business\\", or \\"link- up\\".

Teikei abroad While there is no evidence that teikei was the inspiration for community-supported agriculture (CSA) in the United States, there have been a few examples of CSA programs that have followed the Japanese model closely. The system is valued for its ability to make small-scale agriculture more economically viable and give more control to consumers over the food they consume. Although the CSA movement was born out of anthroposophical and biodynamic farming initiatives, CSA has also enjoyed the benefit of gaining popularity through the booming organic farming movement in the United States that experienced rapid and growth in the late '90s and early '00s, leading to the establishment of organic produce in mainstream retail sales.

The PAG was gradually dismantled from 2006 to 2010 with the divestiture of its constituent brands. History The Premier Automotive Group was formed in 1999 under then-CEO Jacques Nasser. It grew to include responsibility for the Lincoln, Mercury, Aston Martin, Jaguar, Land Rover and Volvo brands. Forbes estimated that, by 2004, Ford had spent $17 billion building on acquisitions to form PAG. Lincoln and Mercury were returned to Ford direct control in 2002. Lincoln's headquarters had been merged into PAG's North American office, where it was run by a German executive who was based in London, England. The four other marques in the PAG, Aston Martin, Jaguar, Land Rover and Volvo, were essentially completely different car companies with their own unique markets and dealer networks, so there were few synergies that could be achieved by combining them under one division. Ford attempted to push these brands to share parts and engineering in order to cut costs. This made some vehicles too similar to mass-market Fords, notably the Jaguar X-Type which was a capable compact executive car yet its reputation suffered mainly because it shared a platform with the Ford Mondeo. While Volvo had been one of the more successful entry-level luxury brands in the United States with the Volvo 740/940 and S70 when it was independent, it lost market share to the German luxury marques like BMW and Mercedes-Benz who had expanded their entry-level offerings extensively. When Alan Mulally became Ford's president and CEO in September 2006, the Premier Automotive Group began to be dismantled. Ford sold 92% of Aston Martin, to a consortium of investors, headed by David Richards in 2007. In September 2006, the rights to use the defunct Rover brand were secured from BMW by Ford to protect the Land Rover brand.Ford buys Rover brand name from BMW from leftlanenews.com In March 2008, Ford sold Jaguar and Land Rover to Indian carmaker Tata Motors. In 2010, Ford sold the Swedish brand Volvo Cars, the last of the PAG, to the parent of Chinese carmaker Geely for $1.8 billion. Management * 1999‚Äì2002: Wolfgang Reitzle * 2002‚Äì2005: Mark Fields * 2005‚Äì2008: Lewis Booth Headquarters The Premier Automotive Group was based in London, England. The Premier Automotive Group's North American headquarters were located at 1 Premier Place in Irvine, California. It is next door to the Mazda North American Operations office, and is now the main office for Taco Bell. The Premier Automotive Group office in the United States was completed in 2001 at a cost of $68 million. It was the first Ford building and the first building in Orange County to qualify for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design classification from the U.S. Green Building Council.\\"Ford Opens PAG Headquarters In California\\" from autointell.com When the headquarters first opened, some of its floors were each specifically dedicated to one of PAG's brands. The complex also included a separate product development centre. In late 2008, a deal was announced to lease the former PAG headquarters building in Irvine to the Taco Bell restaurant chain. Although Ford planned to leave a small product development staff on the property, this was widely seen as the end of the PAG story and an ironic comment on the expensive failure of Ford's luxury-car strategy. The New York Times asked dryly, \\"Will they install a drive-up window?\\" Members =Aston Martin= Aston Martin was a member of PAG. Ford acquired an interest in Aston Martin in 1987 and had full control from 1991. It was sold on 12 March 2007 for ¬£479 million. However, Ford retained a ¬£40 million (8%) stake in Aston Martin.Ford sells Aston Martin for $925 million at egm CarTech, 12 March 2007 =Lincoln= Ford's luxury car division, Lincoln, was part of the Premier Auto Group in the late 1990s, but was pulled out in 2002 as part of Ford's marketing strategy to separate its \\"import\\" marques from its domestic ones. During the creation of PAG, Lincoln's line-up received a complete overhaul, beginning with the 1998 redesign of the Lincoln Town Car. The same year also saw the introduction of the Lincoln Navigator SUV and in 2000 the Lincoln LS, which shared its engines and platform with the Jaguar S-Type, was introduced. All three cars were designed in Irvine, California and were, according to many critics, heavily influenced by Jaguar design themes. In both years 1998 and 2000 Lincoln was the best-selling luxury car brand in the US. After Cadillac surged back into the market in 2002, however, Ford pulled Lincoln out of the PAG in what is according to Jerry Flint of Forbes magazine an \\"impossible to make sense out of... strategy.\\" =Jaguar= Ford made an offer for Jaguar stock in 1989. It was placed in Premier Automotive Group when it was formed. After acquiring Land Rover, Ford market Jaguar and Land Rover together and sold them off together in 2008. =Land Rover= Ford purchased Land Rover in 2000 and added it to the Premier Automotive Group. On 18 September 2006, Ford announced the purchase of the rights to use the Rover name from BMW. As part of Ford's initial purchase of Land Rover, Ford had the option to veto the sale of the Rover name by BMW to any other company. BMW originally intended to sell the Rover name to Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, but had to wait 90 days to allow Ford time to discuss the deal. Ford decided in the end to buy the name outright. However, Ford did not plan to use the name in production, instead buying it merely to protect their use of the name Land Rover.Ford buys Rover brand name from BMW Ford sold Jaguar and Land Rover to Tata Motors in March 2008 for ¬£1.15 billion. As part of Ford's sale of Jaguar and Land Rover to Tata Motors, the defunct Rover brand name was included, as well as the Daimler and Lanchester marques. =Volvo Cars= Ford purchased Volvo's automotive division in 1999 while Volvo's commercial vehicles division became a separate company. Both share the use of symbols and trademarks. Geely was reported to have approached Ford in mid-2008 about a possible takeover of Volvo Cars. On 28 October 2009, Geely was named as the preferred buyer of Volvo Cars by Ford. On 23 December 2009, Ford confirmed that all substantive commercial terms for the sale to Geely had been settled. Geely signed a deal with Ford to acquire Volvo Cars for $1.8 billion on 28 March 2010 and closed the deal on 2 August 2010.

It is more than a guess but less than an accurate calculation or mathematical proof. The defining characteristic of back-of-the-envelope calculations is the use of simplified assumptions. A similar phrase in the U.S. is \\"back of a napkin\\", also used in the business world to describe sketching out a quick, rough idea of a business or product. In British English, a similar idiom is \\"back of a fag packet\\".  History  In the natural sciences, back-of-the-envelope calculation is often associated with physicist Enrico Fermi,Where Fermi stood. - Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists  Encyclopedia.com who was well known for emphasizing ways that complex scientific equations could be approximated within an order of magnitude using simple calculations. He went on to develop a series of sample calculations, which are called \\"Fermi Questions\\" or \\"Back- of-the-Envelope Calculations\\" and used to solve Fermi problems. Back of the Envelope CalculationsHigh School Mathematics at Work: Essays and Examples for the Education of All Students Fermi was known for getting quick and accurate answers to problems that would stump other people. The most famous instance came during the first atomic bomb test in New Mexico on 16 July 1945. As the blast wave reached him, Fermi dropped bits of paper. By measuring the distance they were blown, he could compare to a previously computed table and thus estimate the bomb energy yield. He estimated 10 kilotons of TNT; the measured result was 18.6.Nuclear Weapons Journal, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Issue 2 2005. Perhaps the most influential example of such a calculation was carried out over a period of a few hours by Arnold Wilkins after being asked to consider a problem by Robert Watson Watt. Watt had learned that the Germans claimed to have invented a radio-based death ray, but Wilkins' one-page calculations demonstrated that such a thing was almost certainly impossible. When Watt asked what role radio might play, Wilkins replied that it might be useful for detection at long range, a suggestion that led to the rapid development of radar and the Chain Home system.

The name \\"Geneseo\\" is an anglicization of the Iroquois name for the earlier Iroquois town there, Gen-nis-he-yo, which means \\"beautiful valley\\". The village of Geneseo is entirely contained within the western part of the town of Geneseo at the junction of State Routes 39 and 63 with U.S. Route 20A. The population of the village was 8,031 at the 2010 census, out of 10,483 in the entire town. A portion of the village‚Äîthe Geneseo Historic District‚Äîwas designated a National Historic Landmark by the United States Department of the Interior in 1991.  History  The town of Geneseo was established in 1789, prior to the formation of Livingston County. Settlement began shortly after the arrival of James and William Wadsworth in 1790. The brothers came to the Genesee Valley from Connecticut as agents of their uncle, Colonel Jeremiah Wadsworth, to care for and sell the land he had purchased. The Wadsworths were participants in the negotiations of the Treaty of Big Tree between Robert Morris and the Senecas at the site of Geneseo in 1797. Geneseo, as well as nearby Mount Morris, were part of the Morris Reserve that Morris held back from his sale of much of western New York to the Holland Land Company. The village of Geneseo became the county seat of Livingston County in 1821 and was incorporated in 1832. The State Normal School, now SUNY Geneseo, was opened in 1871. A portion of the village was designated a National Historic Landmark by the United States Department of the Interior in 1991. By 1835 the village consisted of 83 families, and the streets were Main, Second, North, South, Center and Temple Hill. The village grew steadily, and in the 1850s Elm Street was opened. With the advent of the State Normal School in 1871, there was a new surge of development, and Oak Street was opened in the late 1880s. The private Temple Hill Academy, part of which still stands on Temple Hill Road, educated Chester A. Arthur among others. During the Civil War, Union soldiers trained at Camp Union, located at what is now the corner of Lima Road and Rorbach Lane. During World War II, a prisoner-of-war camp was built in Geneseo; it housed mostly Italian soldiers. = Present day = The Doty building, which was purchased and is being renovated for usage by SUNY Geneseo, was once Geneseo's high school. The Livingston County Courthouse and offices are located at the end of Main Street. In its addition of Geneseo to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991, the National Park Service said, The valley of the Genesee is wide and fertile, with some of the best agricultural land in New York, but it was very prone to flooding, and Geneseo suffered several bad floods until the Army Corps of Engineers' construction of the Mount Morris Dam upstream of the community in the 1950s. Agriculture is still a large contributor to Geneseo's economy. Geneseo is also used by many as a bedroom community for jobs in the Rochester area to the north. The village of Geneseo is governed by a mayor and four trustees. The Association for the Preservation of Geneseo (APOG) is a civic organization dedicated to preserving, improving, and restoring the places of civic, architectural, and historic interest to Geneseo and to educate members of the community to their architectural and historical heritage. Additional aims and purposes are to encourage others to contribute their knowledge, advice, and financial assistance. In July 2007, Money magazine ranked Geneseo 10th of 25 on its places with the highest percentage of singles, with 65.1% of the 7,500 inhabitants reported to be single. In addition to the Geneseo Historic District, one individual building, The Homestead, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. One of the village's landmarks, a fountain in the middle of Main Street that was built in the 1880s, was damaged when a tractor trailer crashed into it on April 7, 2016.Tractor trailer crashes into, destroys Geneseo Bear fountain Education The Geneseo Central School District encompasses Geneseo and Groveland, and consists of Geneseo Central School, which graduates approximately 75 students each year. The school mascot is the Blue Devils and wear blue and white, with a gray accent color. Past accent colors included red and black. The school was located on Temple Hill from about 1830 to 1871 when it moved to Center Street. In 1933 it moved to its own building on School Street and in 1963 added a wing. In 1974 it moved into a new building at its present location on Avon Road.Jen-o-see 1933, '63 & 1974-75, yearbooks of the school The State University of New York at Geneseo has approximately 5,000 undergraduate students. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all of it recorded as land. The Genesee River defines the western village line. U.S. Route 20A passes through the village from east to west, while New York State Routes 39 and 63 pass through the village running north to south. Interstate 390 passes south and east of the village, with Exit 8 east of the village on US 20A, and Exit 7 to the south via NY 63. Geneseo is southwest of Rochester, southeast of Batavia, and northwest of Dansville. Climate Geneseo has a mild climate; summers typically bring temperatures between , while winters average .

The town is at the south end of Letchworth State Park. The name of the town stems from the need to portage (carry) canoes around the falls of the Genesee River. The population of Portage was 884 at the 2010 census.  History  The town was first settled around 1810. Portage was formed from part of the town of Nunda in 1827. The \\"High Bridge at Portage\\", built in 1853, was once considered an engineering wonder for wood construction. It was destroyed by a fire in 1875. That same year the bridge was rebuilt in iron according to a design by the railroad engineer Octave Chanute, who later became a pioneer of aviation. In 2015 construction began to build a new high bridge to replace the current bridge due to the structure and age of the current bridge.  Geography  According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and , or 0.89%, are water.

The term comes from the Japanese pronunciation of , which is shortened to puroresu. The term became popular among English-speaking fans due to Hisaharu Tanabe's activities in the online Usenet community. Growing out of origins in the traditional US style of wrestling, it has become an entity in itself. Japanese pro wrestling is distinct in its psychology and presentation of the sport. It is treated as a legitimate fight, with fewer theatrics; the stories told in Japanese matches are about a fighter's spirit and perseverance. In strong style, the style most typically associated with puroresu, full contact martial arts strikes and shoot submission holds are implemented.  Overview  Despite some similarities to the much more popular style of professional wrestling in the United States, Japanese wrestling is known for many differences from the Western style. Puroresu is known for its \\"fighting spirit\\" (, toukon), and the wrestlers are known for their full contact strikes. Many Japanese wrestlers have some degree of knowledge in many different martial arts and wrestling styles; because of this, there are usually doctors and trainers at ringside for assisting the wrestlers after a match. Most matches have clean finishes and many of the promotions don't use any angles or gimmicks. Japanese wrestling is also known for its relationship with fellow mixed martial arts promotions. Wrestling and martial arts icon Antonio Inoki usually organizes wrestling matches and MMA fights on the same card. Puroresu still remains popular and it draws huge crowds from the major promotions. With this and its relationship with other martial arts disciplines, the audiences and wrestlers treat puroresu as a combat sport. It should be also noted that the term \\"Puroresu\\" in Japan refers to all professional wrestling, regardless of country of origin. For example, American promotions WWE and Ring of Honor are referred to as \\"Puroresu\\" in Japan.  Rules  Puroresu has a variety of different rules, which can differ completely from wrestling in other countries. While there is no governing authority for puroresu, there is a general standard which has developed. Each promotion has their own variation, but all are similar enough to avoid confusion. Any convention described here is simply a standard, and may or may not correspond exactly with any given promotion's codified rules. = General structure = Matches are held between two or more sides (\\"corners\\"). Each corner may consist of one wrestler, or a team of two or more. Most team matches are governed by tag team rules (see below). The match is won by scoring a \\"fall\\", which is generally consistent with standard professional wrestling: * Pinning an opponent's shoulders to the mat for the referee's count of three. * Submission victory, which sees the wrestler either tap out or verbally submit to their opponent. * Knockout, the failure to regain composure at the referee's command * Countout, the failure of a party to return to the ring at the referee's command, which is determined by a count of twenty (some federations use ten, but in Japanese wrestling they use twenty). * Disqualification, the act of one wrestler breaking the rules. Additional rules govern how the outcome of the match is to take place. One such example would be the Japanese Universal Wrestling Federation, as it does not allow pinfall victories in favor of submissions and knockouts; this is seen as an early influence of mixed martial arts, as some wrestlers broke away from traditional wrestling endings to matches in favor of legitimate outcomes. Another example is that most promotions disallow punches so a lot of wrestlers utilize open handed strikes and stiff forearms; this rule was also applied in the early stages of Pancrase.  Styles  = Strong style = New Japan Pro- Wrestling, headed by Antonio Inoki, used Inoki's \\"strong style\\" approach of wrestling as a combat sport. Wrestlers incorporated kicks and strikes from martial arts disciplines, and a strong emphasis was placed on submission wrestling. Many of New Japan's wrestlers including top stars such as Shinya Hashimoto, Riki Choshu, Shinsuke Nakamura and Keiji Mutoh came from a legitimate martial arts background. = ≈åd≈ç (\\"King's Road\\") = ≈åd≈ç (\\"King's Road\\"; also translated as \\"Royal Road\\") is a style which originated in All Japan Pro Wrestling, and is most closely associated with the Four Pillars (ÂõõÂ§©Áéã,Shitenn≈ç), the informal nomenclature for 1990s AJPW wrestlers Toshiaki Kawada, Kenta Kobashi, Mitsuharu Misawa, and Akira Taue. However, matches involving these four have been also referred to in Japan as Shitenn≈ç puroresu (). As opposed to strong style's European catch wrestling influences, ≈çd≈ç opted for a more \\"narrative\\" style, derived from the American model of professional wrestling as physical storytelling. However, ≈çd≈ç distinguished itself from American professional wrestling by largely eschewing many of its storytelling devices. Angles, gimmicks, and feuds were virtually non-existent, as all the storytelling in ≈çd≈ç occurred through the matches themselves. Blading was also banned outright. However, as Baba disliked submissions, they were also eschewed for decisive pinfalls. In 2011, Japanese wrestling magazine G Spirits cited Misawa's July 29, 1993 Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship title defense against Kawada as the first match in the Shitenn≈ç style, and the 1993 World's Strongest Tag Determination League final, in which Misawa and Kobashi wrestled Kawada and Taue, was referred to as the \\"completed form\\" of the style by Tokyo Sports in 2014. According to Kawada, ≈çd≈ç matches, which placed a heavy emphasis on fighting spirit, were about \\"breaking the limit you set in the last\\". AJPW referee Kyohei Wada, who recounted that Baba told his talent \\"whatever you want to do, do it, and whatever you can show the people, show it\\", would later compare his job officiating these matches to \\"conducting a symphony\\". However, this escalation eventually manifested through the use of dangerous maneuvers that focused on the head and neck, particularly during the finishing stretches of ≈çd≈ç matches. The physical consequences of this style, or at least its use of head drops, has often been cited as the underlying reason for Misawa's death after an in-ring accident in 2009. Professional wrestling journalist and historian Dave Meltzer noted after his death that Misawa \\"regularly took psychotic bumps\\", including back suplexes where he would land on his head. AJPW would steer away from ≈çd≈ç after Misawa led a mass exodus to form Pro Wrestling Noah, particularly when Motoko Baba sold her stock to Keiji Mutoh, but Noah would continue to practice ≈çd≈ç in its booking. This element of ≈çd≈ç has been criticized for its negative influence on professional wrestling, and 1990s All Japan been cited as a cautionary tale in response to legitimately dangerous maneuvers. Meltzer wrote in 2009 that head drops were \\"never necessary\\", as Misawa and his peers in AJPW were already \\"having the best matches in wrestling\\" before they incorporated these maneuvers into their style. = Other styles = Throughout the 1990s, three individual styles -- shoot style, lucha libre, and hardcore‚Äîwere the main divisions of independent promotions, but as a result of interpromoting, it is not unusual to see all three styles on the same card.  Joshi puroresu  Puroresu done by female wrestlers is called or joshi puro for short.See Keiko Aiba, Transformed Bodies and Gender: Experiences of Women Pro Wrestlers in Japan (Osaka, 2017) () for a full study. Women's professional wrestling in Japan is usually handled by promotions that specialize in joshi puroresu, rather than divisions of otherwise male-dominated promotions as is the case in the United States (the only exception was FMW, a men's promotion which had a small women's division, but even then depended on talent from women's federations to provide competition). However, joshi puroresu promotions usually have agreements with male puroresu promotions such that they recognize each other's titles as legitimate, and may share cards. All Japan Women's Pro- Wrestling was the dominant joshi organization from the 1970s to the 1990s. AJW's first major star was Mach Fumiake in 1974, followed in 1975 by Jackie Sato and Maki Ueda, known as the \\"Beauty Pair\\". The early 1980s saw the fame of Jaguar Yokota and Devil Masami, major stars of the second wave of excellent workers who took the place of the glamour-based \\"Beauty Pair\\" generation. That decade would later see the rise of Chigusa Nagayo and Lioness Asuka, known as the \\"Crush Gals\\", who as a tag team achieved a level of unprecedented mainstream success in Japan, unheard of by any female wrestler in the history of professional wrestling all over the world. Their long running feud with Dump Matsumoto and her \\"Gokuaku Domei\\" (\\"Atrocious Alliance\\") stable would become extremely popular in Japan during the 1980s, with their televised matches resulting in some of the highest rated broadcasts in Japanese television as well as the promotion regularly selling out arenas.. In 1985, Japan's second women's wrestling promotion formed in Japan Women's Pro- Wrestling. The promotion ran their first show on August 17, 1986. It featured Jackie Sato who returned from retirement and future stars such as Shinobu Kandori, Mayumi Ozaki, Cutie Suzuki and Dynamite Kansai, who would go on to be top stars in LLPW and JWP. In 1992, Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling dissolved, splitting into LLPW and JWP. These promotions worked together with FMW and All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling to create a critically acclaimed era with several classic matches authorized by the American wrestling publication Wrestling Observer Newsletter featuring wrestlers such as Manami Toyota, Aja Kong, Kyoko Inoue, Bull Nakano, Mayumi Ozaki, Megumi Kudo, Dynamite Kansai amongsts others. This era was also notable for multiple wrestlers returning from retirement such as Chigusa Nagayo, Lioness Asuka, Jaguar Yokota, Devil Masami and Bison Kimura, which increased interest.

People awarded ejidos in the modern era farm them individually in parcels and collectively maintain communal holdings with government oversight.

(2003) Is Geography Destiny? Lessons from Latin America, Stanford University Press in the twentieth century ejidos are government controlled. After the Mexican Revolution, ejidos were created by the Mexican state to grant lands to peasant communities as a means to stem social unrest. The awarding of ejidos made peasants dependent on the government, with the creation of a bureaucracy to register and regulate them through the National Agrarian Registry (Registro Agrario Nacional). As Mexico prepared to enter the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1991, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari declared the end of awarding ejidos and allowed existing ejidos to be rented or sold, ending land reform in Mexico.Markiewicz, Dana. The Mexican Revolution and the Limits of Agrarian Reform, 1915-1946. Boulder: Lynne Rienner Publishers 1993 Colonial- era indigenous community land holdings In central Mexico following the Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire (1519-1521), indigenous communities remained largely intact, including their system of land tenure. The Spanish crown guaranteed that indigenous communities had land under its control, the fundo legal. It also set up the General Indian Court so that individual natives and indigenous communities could defend their rights against Spanish encroachment.Borah, Woodrow. Justice by Insurance: The General Indian Court of Colonial Mexico and the Legal Aides of the Half-Real. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press 1983. Spanish translation: El Juzgado General de Indios en la Nueva Espa√±a. Mexico: Fondo de Cultura Econ√≥mica 1985. Spaniards applied their own terminology to indigenous community lands, and early in the colonial era began calling them ejidos.Markiewicz, The Mexican Revolution, p. 173. Nineteenth century Mexico achieved its independence from Spain in 1821, following the Mexican War of Independence, the new sovereign nation abolished crown protections of natives and indigenous communities, making them equal before the law rather than vassals of the Spanish crown. The disappearance of the General Indian Court was one effect independence. With political instability and economic stagnation following independence, indigenous communities largely maintained their land holdings, since large landed estates were not expanding to increase production. For nineteenth-century Mexican liberals, the continuing separateness of natives and indigenous villages from the Mexican nation was deemed \\"The Indian Problem,\\" and the breakup of communal landholding identified as the key to integrating of Indians into the Mexican nation. When the Liberals came to power in 1855, they embarked on a major reform that included the expropriation and sale of corporate lands, that is, those held by indigenous communities and by the Roman Catholic Church. The Liberal Reform first put in place the Lerdo Law, calling for the end of corporate landholding and then incorporated that law into the Constitution of 1857. Ejidos were thus legally abolished, although many continued to survive.Van Young, \\"Ejidos\\", p. 471 Mexico was plunged into civil unrest, civil war, and a foreign invasion by the French, so not until the expulsion of the French in 1867 and the restoration of the Mexican republic under liberal control did land reform begin to take effect. Under liberal general Porfirio D√≠az, who came to power by coup in 1876, policies to promote political stability and economic prosperity, \\"order and progress\\", meant that large haciendas began expanding and many villages lost their lands leaving the peasantry landless. Twentieth century Many peasants participated in the Mexican Revolution, with the expectation that their village lands could be restored. In particular, many peasants in the state of Morelos under the leadership of Emiliano Zapata waged war against the presidency of Francisco I. Madero, a wealthy landowner whose reformist political movement sought to oust the regime of Porfirio D√≠az; Victoriano Huerta, the leader of a reactionary coup that ousted and assassinated Madero; and Venustiano Carranza, a wealthy landowner who led the Constitutionalist faction, which defeated all others. In 1917, a new Constitution was drafted, which included empowerment of the government to expropriate privately held resources. Many peasants expected Article 27 of the Constitution to bring about the breakup of large haciendas and to return land to peasant communities. Carranza was entirely resistant to the expropriation of haciendas, and in fact returned many to their owners that had been seized by revolutionaries. Distribution of large amounts of land did not begin until L√°zaro C√°rdenas became president in 1934. The ejido system was introduced as an important component of the land reform in Mexico. Under C√°rdenas, land reform was \\"sweeping, rapid, and, in some respects, structurally innovative... he promoted the collective ejido (hitherto a rare institution) in order to justify the expropriation of large commercial estates.\\"Knight, Alan. \\"Cardenismo: Juggernaut or Jalopy?\\". Journal of Latin American Studies, vol. 26. No. 1 (Feb. 1994, p. 82. The typical procedure for the establishment of an ejido involved the following steps: # landless farmers who leased lands from wealthy landlords would petition the federal government for the creation of an ejido in their general area; #the federal government would consult with the landlord; #the land would be expropriated from the landlords if the government approved the ejido; and #an ejido would be established and the original petitioners would be designated as ejidatarios with certain cultivation/use rights. Ejidatarios do not actually own the land but are allowed to use their allotted parcels indefinitely as long as they do not fail to use the land for more than two years. They can pass their rights on to their children. Criticism Opponents of the ejido system pointed to widespread corruption within the Banco Nacional de Cr√©dito Rural (Banrural)‚Äîthe primary institution responsible for providing loans to ejiditarios‚Äîillegal sales and transfers of ejido lands, ecological degradation, and low productivity as evidence of the system's failure, but defendants countered these arguments by pointing out that every administration since that of C√°rdenas had been either indifferent or openly hostile to ejidos, that the land assigned to ejidos was often of lower quality and therefore inherently less productive than privately held land, that the majority of agricultural research and support was biased towards large-scale commercial enterprises, that the politicians complaining about Banrural were the people responsible for the corruption, and that, regardless of its productivity, subsistence production is an important survival strategy for many peasants. Change As part of a larger program of neoliberal economic restructuring that had already been weakening support for ejidal and other forms of small-scale agriculture and negotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), President Carlos Salinas de Gortari in 1992 pushed legislation through Congress that modified article 27 of the Mexican Constitution to permit the privatization and the sale of ejidal land. This was a direct cause of the Chiapas conflict. The changes to the ejidal system have largely failed to improve ejidal productivity, and have been implicated as significant contributing factors to worsening rural poverty, forced migration, and the conversion of Mexico, where the cultivation of maize originated, into a net-importer of maize and food in general.

The Oregon State Office of Degree Authorization identified Saint Regis University as a diploma mill linked to 18 other front \\"schools\\".\\"List of unaccredited schools and diploma mills\\" Oregon State Office of Degree Authorization, 2006 The school issued degrees based on \\"life experience\\" instead of requiring the taking of academic classes or a formal course of study. It sold both college degrees and high school diplomas. In 2006 the Associated Press reported that \\"at least 135 federal employees\\" held bogus degrees from the Saint Regis operation. This included a White House staffer, a State Department employee in Kuwait, and a Department of Justice employee in Spokane, Washington. Operation and history In November 2005, Times Higher Education noted that prosecutors discovered the university formed part of an elaborate online scam masterminded by a former estate agent called \\"Dixie\\". Furthermore, \\"Dixie Ellen Randock, her husband, Steven Karl Randock Sr, and six alleged accomplices were indicted after a US Secret Service sting. Experts say the group was one of the biggest fish in the booming $1 billion (¬£584 million) a year phony degree and diploma-granting racket.\\" The ring began operating in 1999 and during its operation sold more than $6 million worth of phony high school diplomas and undergraduate and graduate degrees to people in more than 130 countries. In addition to Saint Regis, the ring operated under the names of Ameritech University, Pan America University, James Monroe University, James Monroe High School, All Saints American University, and New Manhattan University.Strauss, Valerie, \\"Hundreds Linked to Diploma Mill\\", Washington Post, July 31, 2008, Pg. B1. Dixie E. and Stephen K. Randock Sr. were indicted in October 2005 on charges of conspiring to commit fraud and laundering nearly $2 million in diploma mill receipts from 2002 to 2005. Dixie E. Randock, Steven K. Randock, Heidi Kae Lorhan, and Blake Carlson entered guilty pleas to conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud in a U.S. District Court in Washington in March 2008.\\"Husband, daughter of Spokane diploma mill operator enter pleas,\\" Seattle Times March 27, 2008 Seattle Times\\"3 Operators of Major Diploma-Mill Chain Plead Guilty to Fraud Charges\\" by Thomas Bartlett Chronicle of Higher Education, April 4, 2008 In July 2008 Dixie Randock was sentenced to three years in prison. Her daughter was sentenced to one year and one day in prison, and Randock's husband was scheduled to be sentenced August 5, 2008. Others involved were to be sentenced later in 2008. On January 31, 2007, the New York City Department of Investigation reported that several members of the New York City Fire Department had used \\"phony degrees\\" from St. Regis University to qualify for promotions.Report Says 14 in Fire Dept. Used Fake Degrees, New York Times, February 1, 2007The City of New York Department of Investigation news release , January 31, 2007 Fourteen firefighters received disciplinary fines as a result.The City of New York Department of Investigation news release, September 7, 2007 Investigations and litigation =Teachers in Georgia= Saint Regis University made national news when 11 teachers in Gwinnett County, Georgia, United States were found using degrees from this institution to increase their salaries. In July 2004, the Georgia Professional Standards Commission revoked the licenses of all 11 teachers.\\"11 educators will lose state licenses.\\" Atlanta Journal Constitution. July 9, 2004. When it was discovered St. Regis University was a diploma mill, six teachers resigned. Georgia officials accepted those credentials because of letters they received from a credential evaluator, Career Consultants International in Sunrise, Florida. CCI said the credentials were equal to those from a regionally accredited U.S. university. The officials now suspect that CCI was not giving independent evaluations, according to the Georgia Professional Standards Commission executive secretary, F.D. Toth. Toth said the commission received letters from CCI for 11 of the 12 educators, stating that their Saint Regis degrees met the same rigor and content standards as do those from regionally accredited U.S. colleges and universities, which is the standard for Georgia's recognition of degrees. CCI is part of National Success Marketing Inc., based in Sunrise, Florida, and owned by Sheila Danzig and William H. Danzig. Sheila Danzig described a relationship with Saint Regis that throws into question the company's objectivity as an evaluator of credentials. She said her company receives a fee, paid by Saint Regis, every time CCI evaluates the academic credentials of one of its students. Danzig also said she was a paid consultant to Saint Regis. =Liberian controversy= CCI is currently operating under the name \\"The Degree People\\". Calls to the ministry of education of Liberia resulted in callers being told that SRU was accredited. Later it was learned that the accreditation was part of a bribery scheme but no one in Liberia appeared to be punished. CCI withdrew all SRU evaluations as soon as this scheme was revealed. The operators \\"falsely asserted\\" Liberian and Indian government approval and actually operated \\"mainly from State of Washington but may have operations elsewhere\\". The Oregon office notes the linkages between James Monroe International University (aka James Monroe University), St. Regis University, Robertstown University, and over 15 other named institutions. On October 4, 2004 the Liberian Embassy in Washington, D.C. posted the message \\"URGENT DISCLAIMER ON THE ILLEGAL ESTABLISHMENT AND RECOGNITION OF HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS IN THE REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA\\" declaring \\"null and void whatever documents St. Regis University may claim to possess emanating from the [National] Commission [of Higher Education].\\"Urgent Disclaimer on the illegal establishment and recognition of higher education institutions in the Republic of Liberia The Embassy of Liberia, 2004. The regionally accredited Regis University of Denver, Colorado filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against St. Regis on December 6, 2004. This action, case no. CV-04-462-RHW, was publicly filed in the U.S. District Court of the Eastern District of Washington State. Most St. Regis academic material was transferred to the James Monroe University site after the lawsuit was filed. A few months later the domain administrator for .lr (Liberia) internet domains cancelled saintregis.edu.lr, in effect eliminating the Web presence of St. Regis. =Arrests and convictions= In October 2005 the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Washington announced the indictments of eight alleged operators of St. Regis. Charged with violations of Title 18 of the United States Code were Dixie Randock, Steven Randock Sr., Blake Carlson, Richard Novak, Heidi Lorhan, Amy Hensley, Roberta Markishtum, and Kenneth Pearson. In January 2006 Pearson was also indicted for possession and receipt of child pornography, a federal felony. According to prosecutors, four computers seized from Pearson's home in association with the diploma mill investigation were found to contain more than 10,000 sexually explicit images of children. Carlson pleaded guilty to one Class D felony count of \\"Conspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud and Mail Fraud\\" on March 7, 2006. Novak pleaded guilty to one Class D felony count of \\"Conspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud and Mail Fraud and to Violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act\\" and a second Class D felony count of \\"Violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act\\" on March 20, 2006. In his plea agreement, Novak said he had paid Liberian officials $44,000 in return for allowing the operation to claim accreditation in Liberia.Thomas Bartlett, Diploma-Mill Operators Bribed Liberian Officials for Bogus Credentials, Court Documents Say, The Chronicle of Higher Education, March 22, 2006 Pearson pleaded guilty on October 10, 2006 to one count of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and one count of receipt of child pornography.United States of America v. Kenneth Wade Pearson, Plea Agreement, U.S. State District Court, Eastern District of Washington =United States government employees= In October 2006, the Associated Press reported that employees of the federal government in the United States had received diplomas from St. Regis and its affiliates. Though they have not been identified by name, the employees reportedly included a White House staff member, National Security Agency employees, a senior State Department official, and a Department of Justice employee.White House, NSA staff said to be buyers from online diploma mill, The Associated Press, October 12, 2006 On July 31, 2008 the Washington Post announced that it had obtained a list of 9,600 names of people who had inquired into or purchased degrees from the diploma mill. Two-hundred ninety- four of the names were of people living in the Virginia, Maryland, or District of Columbia area with 20 of them appearing to be military members and 10 government employees or government contractors. =Washington state employees= In 2009, a social worker and two counselors in the state of Washington were accused of misrepresenting their professional credentials by using \\"fake degrees\\" from Saint Regis. James Monroe International University James Monroe International University, formerly known as James Monroe University, claimed to be based in Seborga and have accreditation from the Minister of Education in Seborga and from the Distance Education Council (DEC) of India. Previously it claimed to be in Liberia and accredited by the Liberian government. It was revealed to be run by some of the same operators as Saint Regis University.Bail granted for operators of alleged diploma mill, Associated Press, 28 October 2005 =CNN coverage= On December 15, 2005, CNN aired a report on diploma mills and terrorism.

Robertstown University Robertstown University formerly claimed that it was in Liberia and was accredited by the Liberian Government. It was to be closed until the issues involving its accreditation by the Liberian government were resolved. However, it was later revealed to be run by the same operators as Saint Regis University.

It has been awarded since 1917 for distinguished editorial writing, the test of excellence being clearness of style, moral purpose, sound reasoning, and power to influence public opinion in what the writer conceives to be the right direction. Thus it is one of the original Pulitzers, for the program was inaugurated in 1917 with seven prizes, four of which were awarded that year.\\"1917 Winners\\". The Pulitzer Prizes (pulitzer.org). Retrieved 2013-12-19. The program has also recognized opinion journalism with its Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning from 1922. Finalists have been announced from 1980, ordinarily two others beside the winner. One person ordinarily wins the award for work with one newspaper or with affiliated papers, and that was true without exception between 1936 (the only time two prizes were given) and 1977. In the early years, several newspapers were recognized without naming any writer, and that has occasionally happened recently. Several times from 1977, two or three people have shared the award for their work with one paper. Winners and citations In its first 97 years to 2013, the Editorial Writing Pulitzer was awarded 89 times. In nine years there was no award given and there were two prizes in 1936.

(also known as Wazzup) was a commercial campaign for Anheuser-Busch Budweiser beer from 1999 to 2002. The first spot aired during Monday Night Football on December 20, 1999. The ad campaign was run worldwide and became a pop culture catchphrase. The phrase itself is a slurred version of the phrase \\"What's up?\\". The commercials were based on a short film, entitled True, written and directed by Charles Stone III, that featured Stone and several of his childhood friends ‚Äì Fred Thomas, Paul Williams, Terry Williams, Jimmy \\"Puerto Rock\\" Perez and Kevin Lofton. The characters sat around talking on the phone and saying \\"whassup?\\" to one another in a comical way. The short was popular at a number of film festivals around the country and eventually caught the attention of creative director Vinny Warren and art director Chuck Taylor at the Chicago-based ad agency DDB, who took the idea to August A. Busch IV, vice president of Anheuser-Busch, and signed Stone to direct Budweiser TV commercials based on the film. Scott Martin Brooks won the role of Dookie when Kevin Lofton declined to audition. Whassup? won the Cannes Grand Prix award and the Grand Clio award, among others. In May 2006, the campaign was inducted into the CLIO Hall of Fame. Eight years later, Stone made another version of the ad with the same cast, called Wassup 2008. The two-minute short film was heavily critical of the presidency of George W. Bush and was a clear endorsement of the presidential campaign of Barack Obama. The 2008 video was nominated for the Favorite User Generated Video award at the 35th People's Choice Awards. In popular culture The film Scary Movie (2000) parodied the ad in one scene. In 2001, the British music duo Shaft released a song and video titled \\"Wassuup!\\" under the name Da Muttz, referencing the Budweiser ad, set to a sample of \\"U Can't Touch This\\" by MC Hammer (which, in turn, sampled Rick James' \\"Super Freak\\"). It reached number 11 on the UK Singles Chart, and was also a hit on charts across Europe and in Australia. Professional wrestling tag team The Dudley Boyz incorporated part of the ad as one of their signature moves. D-Von would climb to the top rope while Bubba Ray held an opponent's legs apart, before they both stuck out their tongues and did the Whassup head shake. D-Von would then execute a diving headbutt to the crotch of the opponent. The Simpsons episodes \\"The Bart Wants What It Wants\\" (2002) and \\"See Homer Run\\" (2005) both feature the character Milhouse using the expression in an attempt to be cool. The Greg the Bunny episode \\"Father and Son Reunion\\" (2002) featured the character Gil trying to bond with his son Jimmy. Gil thinks all young people use the expression to be cool. They go out together along with Greg the Bunny and Gil shouts the expression at everyone they meet, much to the embarrassment of Jimmy. In the 2003 Friends episode \\"The One With Phoebe's Rats\\", Ross enters Monica and Chandler's apartment saying \\"Whassup\\" trying to imitate the commercial, to which Chandler replies, \\"Seriously dude, three years ago!\\" The Office episode \\"Pilot\\" has Michael Scott, Jim, and Dwight exchanging the expression with each other. Jim wryly tells the camera that Scott is still doing it constantly, seven years after the ad was popular. The Aqua Teen Hunger Force episode \\"Multiple Meat\\" (2010) had Frylock using the expression to Master Shake and when the latter does not react to it he asks \\"I'm sorry, is that out now?\\" The ad is also parodied in four episodes of the web series The Annoying Orange. It has since become a staple running gag. The band Falling in Reverse parodied the ad in the music video of the song \\"Good Girls, Bad Guys\\" (2011). The phrase is used as a recurring joke in the film That's My Boy (2012 film), starting Adam Sandler and Andy Samberg. There are also multiple occurrences of Budweiser product placement throughout the film. In the film Central Intelligence (2016), Bob Stone sends Calvin Joyner a video clip of the ad and asks, \\"remember those commercials?\\" In the How I Met Your Mother episode \\"Trilogy Time\\", Barney Stinson uses the expression in supposed \\"dream\\" futures. In the Letterkenny episode \\"The Election\\" (2016), Stewart parodies the ad with Reilly & Jonesy in a campaign video for Wayne. In Season 1, Episode 8 of Santa Clarita Diet, Drew Barrymore‚Äôs character says \\"Whassup?\\" to a ‚Äúdead‚Äù undead character Loki, played by DeObia Oparei. In the film Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018) Luis pulls up next to Scott and says it multiple times. June 2018, Burger King and Budweiser partnered to create a new Whassup? commercial. In episode 148 of \\"Being the Elite\\" titled, \\"Dead Friend 1\\", Socal Uncensored (SCU) parodied the ad but instead of \\"Whassup\\", they say SCU. A new version of the Budweiser ad was aired during the COVID-19 pandemic, encouraging friends to check in with each other during lockdown.

Since the first reports in the late nineteenth century, various names have been applied to these organisms, sometimes with the same name being applied to different species. More recently, not only have there been changes to the nomenclature, but also attempts to differentiate between species which are believed to be either pathogenic or commensal or both. Because of their asaccharolytic nature, and a general paucity of positive results in routine biochemical tests, laboratory identification of the fusobacteria has been difficult. However, the application of novel molecular biological techniques to taxonomy has established a number of new species, together with the subspeciation of Fusobacterium necrophorum and F. nucleatum, and provided new methods for identification. The involvement of fusobacteria in a wide spectrum of human infections causing tissue necrosis and septicaemia has long been recognised, and, more recently, their importance in intra-amniotic infections, premature labour and tropical ulcers has been reported. Since the first reports of fusobacteria in the late nineteenth century, the variety of species names has led to some confusion within the genera Fusobacterium and Leptotrichia. However, newer methods of investigation have led to a better understanding of the taxonomy, with the description of several new species of fusobacteria. Among the new species described are F. ulcerans from tropical ulcers, and several species from the oral cavity. Subspeciation of the important species F. necrophorum and F. nucleatum has also been possible. It is probable that the taxonomy of the fusobacteria may be further developed in the future. Phylogeny The currently accepted taxonomy is based on the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LSPN) and the phylogeny is based on 16S rRNA-based LTP release 123 by The All-Species Living Tree Project.See the All-Species Living Tree Project .

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration defines cream cheese as containing at least 33% milk fat with a moisture content of not more than 55%, and a pH range of 4.4 to 4.9. Similarly, under Canadian Food and Drug Regulations cream cheese must contain at least 30% milk fat and a maximum of 55% moisture. In other countries, it is defined differently and may need a considerably higher fat content. Cream cheese is not naturally matured and is meant to be consumed fresh, so it differs from other soft cheeses such as Brie and Neufch√¢tel. It is more comparable in taste, texture, and production methods to Boursin and mascarpone. Origin =Europe= Early types of cream cheese are mentioned in England as early as 1583 and in France as early as 1651.Harold McGee, On Food And CookingLa Varenne, Le Cuisinier fran√ßois Recipes are recorded soon after 1754, particularly from Lincolnshire and the southwest of England.An English and Danish Dictionary, Andreas Berthelson, London, 1754 =United States= Recipes for cream cheese can be found in U.S. cookbooks and newspapers beginning in the mid-18th century. By the 1820s, dairy farms in the vicinity of Philadelphia and New York City had gained a reputation for producing the best examples of this cheese. Cream cheese was produced on family farms throughout the country, so quantities made and distributed were typically small. Around 1873 William A. Lawrence, a dairyman in Chester, New York, was the first to mass-produce cream cheese. In 1872, he purchased a Neufch√¢tel factory. By adding cream to the process, he developed a richer cheese that he called ‚Äúcream cheese‚Äù.The story, found in numerous cheese histories, that Lawrence ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù made cream cheese or had stolen the recipe from another Chester dairyman, Charles Green, is a fabrication. Jeffrey A. Marx, \\"The Days Had Come of Curds and Cream\\": The Origins and Development of Cream Cheese in America, in Journal of Food, Culture and Society, Vol. 15, Issue 2, June 2012. In 1877 Lawrence created the first brand of cream cheese: its logo was a silhouette of a cow followed by the words \\"Neufchatel & Cream Cheese\\". In 1879, to build a larger factory, Lawrence entered into an arrangement with Samuel S. Durland, another Chester merchant.Marx (2012). In 1880, Alvah Reynolds, a New York cheese distributor, began to sell the cheese of Lawrence & Durland and called it \\"Philadelphia Cream Cheese\\".Jeffrey A. Marx, ‚ÄúPhiladelphiaÔ£® Comes to New York: The Marketing of Cream Cheese in New York State,‚Äù New York History, Quarterly Journal of the New York State Historical Association and The State University of New York College at Oneonta, 96, no. 2 (2015). Histories that imply the cheese was produced in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, or Philadelphia, New York, are incorrect. Marx (2012); International Cheese Company v. Phenix Cheese Company (1906). By the end of 1880, faced with increasing demand for his Philadelphia-brand cheese, Reynolds turned to Charles Green, a second Chester dairyman, who by 1880 had been manufacturing cream cheese as well. Some of Green‚Äôs cheese was also sold under the Philadelphia label. In 1892 Reynolds bought the Empire Cheese Co. of South Edmeston, New York, to produce cheese under his \\"Philadelphia\\" label. When the Empire factory burned down in 1900, he asked the newly formed Phenix Cheese Company to produce his cheese, instead. In 1903 Reynolds sold rights to the \\"Philadelphia\\" brand name to Phenix Cheese Company, which was under the direction of Jason F. Whitney, Sr. (It merged with Kraft in 1928).Marx (2012, 2015); International Cheese Company v. Phenix Cheese Company (1906). By the early 1880s Star cream cheese had emerged as Lawrence & Durland's brand, and Green made World and Globe brands of the cheese. At the turn of the 20th century, New York dairymen were producing cream cheese sold under a number of other brands, as well: Triple Cream (C. Percival), Eagle (F.X. Baumert), Empire (Phenix Cheese Co.), Mohican (International Cheese Co.), Monroe Cheese Co. (Gross & Hoffman), and Nabob (F.H. Legget). Marx (2012); W.A. Lawrence et al v. P. E. Sharpless Co. (1912); International Cheese Company v. Phenix Cheese Company (1906). Cream cheese became popular in the Jewish cuisine of New York City, where it is commonly known as a \\"schmear\\". It is used on bagels, and is the basis of the bagel and cream cheese, a common open-faced sandwich. Lox, capers, and other ingredients are often added to this dish. The basic bagel and cream cheese has become a ubiquitous breakfast and brunch food throughout the United States. =Canada= While industrial cream cheeses, such as \\"Philadelphia\\", are the most commonly found varieties, traditional fresh cream cheeses, not containing stabilizers or preservatives maintain a presence in the Canadian market, such as the cream cheese sold by the Western Dairy division of Gay Lea and Liberte Inc. Manufacture A block of Philadelphia cream cheese Cream cheese is easy to make at home, and many methods and recipes are used. Consistent, reliable, commercial manufacture is more difficult. Normally, protein molecules in milk have a negative surface charge, which keeps milk in a liquid state; the molecules act as surfactants, forming micelles around the particles of fat and keeping them in emulsion. Lactic acid bacteria are added to pasteurized and homogenized milk. During the fermentation around , the pH of the milk decreases (it becomes more acidic). Amino acids at the surface of the proteins begin losing charge and become neutral, turning the fat micelles from hydrophilic to hydrophobic state and causing the liquid to coagulate. If the bacteria are left in the milk too long, the pH lowers further, the micelles attain a positive charge, and the mixture returns to liquid form. The key, then, is to kill the bacteria by heating the mixture to at the moment the cheese is at the isoelectric point, meaning the state at which half the ionizable surface amino acids of the proteins are positively charged and half are negative. Inaccurate timing of the heating can produce inferior or unsalable cheese due to variations in flavor and texture. Cream cheese has a higher fat content than other cheeses, and fat repels water, which tends to separate from the cheese; this can be avoided in commercial production by adding stabilizers such as guar or carob gums to prolong its shelf life. In Canada, the regulations for cream cheese stipulate that it be made by coagulating cream with the help of bacteria, forming a curd which is then formed into a mass after removing the whey. Some of its ingredients include cream (to adjust milk fat content), salt, nitrogen (to improve spreadability) and several gelling, thickening, stabilizing and emulsifying ingredients such as xanthan gum or gelatin, to a maximum of 0.5 percent. Regulations on preservatives used are that either sorbic acid, or propionic acid may be used independently or combined, but only to a maximum of 3,000 parts per million when used together. The only acceptable enzymes that can be used in manufacturing of cream cheese to be sold in Canada are chymosin A and B, pepsin and rennet. In Spain and Mexico, cream cheese is sometimes called by the generic name queso filadelfia, following the marketing of Philadelphia-branded cream cheese by Kraft Foods. Uses Cream cheese on a bagel Cream cheese is often spread on bread, bagels, crackers, etc., and used as a dip for potato chips and similar snack items, and in salads. It can be mixed with other ingredients, such as yogurt or pepper jelly, to make spreads. Cream cheese can be used for many purposes in sweet and savoury cookery, and is in the same family of ingredients as other milk products, such as cream, milk, butter, and yogurt. It can be used in cooking to make cheesecake and to thicken sauces and make them creamy. Cream cheese is sometimes used in place of or with butter (typically two parts cream cheese to one part butter) when making cakes or cookies, and cream cheese frosting. It is the main ingredient in the filling of crab rangoon, an appetizer commonly served at U.S. Chinese restaurants. It can also be used instead of or in conjunction with butter or olive oil in mashed potatoes, and in some westernized sushi rolls. It can also be used for ants on a log. American cream cheese tends to have lower fat content than elsewhere, but \\"Philadelphia\\" branded cheese is sometimes suggested as a substitute for petit suisse.Julia Child, Mastering the Art of French Cooking See also * Bagel and cream cheese * List of spreads  References  Category:Sour foods ","title":"Cream cheese"},{"id":"550450","text":"Cristobalite is a mineral polymorph of silica that is formed at very high- temperatures. It is used in dentistry as a component of alginate impression materials as well as for making models of teeth It has the same chemical formula as quartz, SiO2, but a distinct crystal structure. Both quartz and cristobalite are polymorphs with all the members of the quartz group, which also include coesite, tridymite and stishovite. Cristobalite occurs as white octahedra or spherulites in acidic volcanic rocks and in converted diatomaceous deposits in the Monterey Formation of the US state of California and similar areas. Cristobalite is stable only above 1470 ¬∞C, but can crystallize and persist metastably at lower temperatures. It is named after Cerro San Crist√≥bal in Pachuca Municipality, Hidalgo, Mexico. The persistence of cristobalite outside its thermodynamic stability range occurs because the transition from cristobalite to quartz or tridymite is \\"reconstructive\\", requiring the breaking up and reforming of the silica framework. These frameworks are composed of SiO4 tetrahedra in which every oxygen atom is shared with a neighbouring tetrahedron, so that the chemical formula of silica is SiO2. The breaking of these bonds required to convert cristobalite to tridymite and quartz requires considerable activation energy and may not happen on a human time frame. Framework silicates are also known as tectosilicates. There is more than one form of the cristobalite framework. At high temperatures, the structure is cubic, Fdm, No. 227, Pearson symbol cF104. A tetragonal form of cristobalite (P41212, No. 92, Pearson symbol tP12) occurs on cooling below about 250 ¬∞C at ambient pressure and is related to the cubic form by a static tilting of the silica tetrahedra in the framework. This transition is variously called the low-high or \\\\alpha{-}\\\\beta transition. It may be termed \\"displacive\\"; i.e., it is not generally possible to prevent the cubic Œ≤-form from becoming tetragonal by rapid cooling. Under rare circumstances the cubic form may be preserved if the crystal grain is pinned in a matrix that does not allow for the considerable spontaneous strain that is involved in the transition, which causes a change in shape of the crystal. This transition is highly discontinuous. The exact transition temperature depends on the crystallinity of the cristobalite sample, which itself depends on factors such as how long it has been annealed at a particular temperature. The cubic Œ≤ phase consists of dynamically disordered silica tetrahedra. The tetrahedra remain fairly regular and are displaced from their ideal static orientations due to the action of a class of low-frequency phonons called rigid unit modes. It is the \\"freezing\\" of one of these rigid unit modes that is the soft mode for the Œ±‚ÄìŒ≤ transition. In the Œ±‚ÄìŒ≤ phase transition only one of the three degenerate cubic crystallographic axes retains a fourfold rotational axis in the tetragonal form. The choice of axis is arbitrary, so that various twins can form within the same grain. These different twin orientations coupled with the discontinuous nature of the transition can cause considerable mechanical damage to materials in which cristobalite is present and that pass repeatedly through the transition temperature, such as refractory bricks. When devitrifying silica, cristobalite is usually the first phase to form, even when well outside its thermodynamic stability range. This is an example of Ostwald's step rule. The dynamically disordered nature of the Œ≤-phase is partly responsible for the low enthalpy of fusion of silica. The micrometre-scale spheres that make up precious opal exhibit some x-ray diffraction patterns that are similar to that of cristobalite, but lack any long-range order so they are not considered true cristobalite. In addition, the presence of structural water in opal makes it doubtful that opal consists of cristobalite.https://www.osha.gov/dsg/topics/silicacrystalline/smithdk/pdf/nomenc.pdf.

States which wield unrivalled power and influence within a region of the world possess regional hegemony.  Characteristics  Regional powers shape the polarity of a regional area. Typically, regional powers have capabilities which are important in the region but do not have capabilities at a global scale. Slightly contrasting definitions differ as to what makes a regional power. The European Consortium for Political Research defines a regional power as: > \\"A state belonging to a geographically defined region, dominating this > region in economic and military terms, able to exercise hegemonic influence > in the region and considerable influence on the world scale, willing to make > use of power resources and recognized or even accepted as the regional > leader by its neighbours\\". The German Institute of Global and Area Studies states that a regional power must: * form part of a definable region with its own identity * claim to be a regional power (self-image as a regional power) * exert decisive influence on the geographic extension of the region as well as on its ideological construction * dispose over comparatively high military, economic, demographic, political and ideological capabilities * be well integrated into the region * define the regional security agenda to a high degree * be appreciated as a regional power by other powers in the region and beyond, especially by other regional powers * be well connected with regional and global forums  Regional powers  Below are states that have been described as regional powers by international relations and political science academics, analysts, or other experts.

With economic turmoil, Japan's expulsion from the League of Nations, and its interest in expansion on the mainland, Japan became one of the three main Axis powers in World War II. Since the late 20th century, regional alliances, economic progress, and contrasting military power have changed the strategic and regional power balance in Asia. In recent years, a re-balancing of military and economic power among countries such as China and India has resulted in significant changes in the geopolitics of Asia. China and Japan have also gained greater influence over regions outside Asia, with the former now contending with the United States for geopolitical clout in most major regions. With close economic and military ties to the United States, Japan was the main Asian base of operations of America's \\"containment\\" strategy during the Cold War.

Brehm (January 14, 1925 ‚Äì August 11, 1996) was a very close witness to the assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963. Early life Brehm was a World War II veteran who served in the United States Army Rangers who fought and was wounded at the Omaha beach invasion at Pointe du Hoc, France during D-Day. He later also served during the Korean War. Watched presidential motorcade with his son Charles F. Brehm and his 5-year-old son, Joe, were standing in the Dealey Plaza north infield grass, a few feet south of the south curb of Elm Street. They were across the street from Abraham Zapruder and the Dealey Plaza grassy knoll. Both Brehm and Joe can be clearly seen in the Zapruder film. When the presidential limousine turned from Main Street onto Houston Street, Brehm and his son watched from the northwest side of the intersection. After watching the turn, Brehm and his son quickly ran northwestward across the \\"north infield grass\\" towards the south curb of Elm Street. They hoped to catch another glimpse of the President. They were standing close to the south curb, directly across the street from Bill and Gayle Newman and their two boys. The location was about 20 feet northeast from close assassination witnesses Jean Hill, and Mary Moorman, as the limousine rounded the 120-degree slow turn from Houston Street onto Elm Street. The movie-filming \\"babushka lady\\" was standing nearby to Brehm's right backside. Description of shots which wounded and killed JFK Brehm said President Kennedy was approaching him, and was only 30 feet away, when his son began to wave to President Kennedy. President Kennedy started to wave back, then Brehm heard the first shot he remembered hearing. Kennedy did not start waving until Zapruder film frame Z-171, which was after live oak tree branches and foliage had already temporarily hidden the President from Z-162 to Z-208 from being seen by anyone in the Texas School Book Depository's sixth-floor window. Brehm stated to the Federal Bureau of Investigation that \\"he could see the President's face very well, the President was seated, but was leaning forward when he stiffened perceptibly. He seemed to stiffen and come to a pause. The first shot Brehm remembered hearing was also the first shot that impacted the President. The President reacted immediately to the impact.\\" When the President was 15 to 25 feet away, just past Brehm's location, Brehm remembered hearing a second shot that struck President Kennedy in the head. Brehm watched the President's \\"hair fly up, ripple, and bits of brain and bone went flying, and then roll over to his side.\\" President Kennedy \\"slumped all the way down\\". On the third anniversary of the assassination, Brehm stated that he was \\"more than satisfied\\" with the Warren Commission's findings. Although he was not called to provide testimony to the Commission, Brehm stated: \\"I see no reason why I should be called. I did not see the man who shot him. I did not see the shots fired. I don't feel that anything I would have said would have had any bearing on their outcome.\\" He described books recent published by Warren Commission critics as \\"nothing but cheap sensationalism\\". Contributions to assassination documentaries In the 1966 video documentary Rush to Judgment while speaking of the blood cloud and the bits of brain and bone matter that Brehm saw flying in the air when the President's head exploded, Brehm stated he was specifically attracted to watch a piece fly towards himself, \\"over in the area of the curb where I was standing.\\" ... \\"It seemed to have come left, and back.\\" ... \\"Sir, whatever it was that I saw did fall, both, in that direction, and, over into the curb there.\\" Charles Brehm was located behind, and to the President's left when the President's head first exploded. On November 22, 1963, only minutes after the assassination, and while he was still standing within Dealey Plaza, Brehm was quoted by a newspaper reporter as saying, \\"He was waving, then the first shot hit him and that awful look crossed his face,\\" and that Brehm \\"seemed to think the shots came from in front of, or, beside the President.\\"11-22-63 \\"Dallas Times Herald\\" newspaper, fifth and final edition, that mis-spelled his name as \\"Drehm\\" In his November 24, 1963, FBI statement, and, during the 1987 Showtime cable-TV mock trial, The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald, Brehm testified that the shots came from either the Texas School Book Depository or the Dal-Tex building. In a 1967 interview with Playboy Magazine, Mark Lane said \\"[Brehm] told me in a filmed interview that a portion of the President's skull was driven back and sharply to the left, over the rear of the President's car. Unless the laws of physics were temporarily suspended, this offers impressive corroboration for those who say the shot came from the right front of the car‚Äîin substantially the opposite direction from the Depository.\\" Like many other supporting witnesses, Brehm stated that he distinctly remembered hearing another separate shot after the shot which wounded the President's head. The latter shot missed hitting anyone and was the reason that Brehm quickly dragged his son to the ground, covering him protectively. In 1988 Brehm told author Larry Sneed, \\"After the car passed the building coming toward us, I heard a... surprising noise, and (the President) reached with both hands up to the side of his throat and kind of stiffened out.... And when he got down in the area just past me, the second shot hit which damaged, considerably damaged, the top of his head.... That car took off in an evasive motion... and was just beyond me when a third shot went off. The third shot really frightened me! It had a completely different sound to it because it had really passed me as anybody knows who has been in down under targets in the Army or been shot at like I had been many times. You know when a bullet passes over you, the cracking sound it makes, and that bullet had an absolute crack to it. I do believe that that (third) shot was wild. It didn't hit anybody. I don't think it could have hit anybody. But it was a frightening thing to me because here was one shot that hit him, obviously; here was another shot that destroyed his head, and what was the reason for that third shot? That third shot frightened me more than the other two, and I grabbed the boy and threw him on the ground because I didn't know if we were going to have a 'shoot-'em- up' in this area.\\" References External links * Category:1925 births Category:1996 deaths Category:Witnesses to the assassination of John F.

In human‚Äìcomputer interaction, WIMP stands for \\"windows, icons, menus, pointer\\", denoting a style of interaction using these elements of the user interface. Other expansions are sometimes used, such as substituting \\"mouse\\" and \\"mice\\" for menus, or \\"pull- down menu\\" and \\"pointing\\" for pointer. Though the acronym has fallen into disuse, it has often been likened to the term graphical user interface (GUI). Any interface that uses graphics can be called a GUI, and WIMP systems derive from such systems. However, while all WIMP systems use graphics as a key element (the icon and pointer elements), and therefore are GUIs, the reverse is not true. Some GUIs are not based in windows, icons, menus, and pointers. For example, most mobile phones represent actions as icons and menus, but do not often don't rely on a conventional pointer or containerized windows to host program interactions. WIMP interaction was developed at Xerox PARC (see Xerox Alto, developed in 1973) and popularized with Apple's introduction of the Macintosh in 1984, which added the concepts of the \\"menu bar\\" and extended window management.Andries van Dam: Post-WIMP User Interfaces. In: Communications of the ACM, 40(2) (February 1997), pp. 63‚Äì67. Citeseer The WIMP interface has the following components: * A window runs a self-contained program, isolated from other programs that (if in a multi-program operating system) run at the same time in other windows. **These individual program containers enable users to move fluidly between different windows. **The window manager software is typically designed such that it is clear which window is currently active. Design principles of spacing, grouping, and simplicity help the user maintain focus when working between more than one window. * An icon acts as a shortcut to an action the computer performs (e.g., execute a program or task). **Text labels can be used alongside icons to help identification for small icon sets. * A menu is a text or icon-based selection system that selects and executes programs or tasks. Menus may change depending on context in which they are accessed. * The pointer is an onscreen symbol that represents movement of a physical device that the user controls to select icons, data elements, etc. This style of system improves human‚Äìcomputer interaction (HCI) by emulating real-world interactions and providing better ease of use for non-technical people. Because programs contained by a WIMP interface subsequently rely on the same core input methods, the interactions throughout the system are standardized. This consistency allows users' skills carry from one application to another. Criticism Some human‚Äìcomputer interaction researchers consider WIMP to be ill-suited for multiple applications, especially those requiring precise human input or more than three dimensions of input.Past, Present and Future of User Interface Software Tools. Brad Myers, Scott E. Hudson, Randy Pausch, Y Pausch. ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction, 2000. Drawing and writing are example of these limitations; a traditional pointer is limited by two dimensions, and consequently doesn't account for the pressure applied when using a physical writing utility. Pressure sensitive graphics tablets are often used to overcome this limitation. Another issue with WIMP-style user interfaces is that many implementations put users with disabilities at a disadvantage. For example, visually impaired users may have difficulty using applications when alternative text-based interfaces are not made available. People with motor impairments, such as Parkinson's disease, may not be able to navigate devices precisely using the traditional mouse pointer for input. To overcome these barriers, researchers continue to explore ways to make modern computer systems more accessible.Marcelo Medeiros Carneiro, Luiz Velho, Assistive Interfaces For The Visually Impaired Using Force Feedback Devices And Distance Transforms, Information Technology and Disabilities Journal, Vol. X, No. 2, December 2004 Recent developments in artificial intelligence, specifically machine learning, have opened new doors for accessibility in technology, or assistive technology.  Moving past the WIMP interface  Multiple studies have explored the possibilities of moving past the WIMP interface, such as using reality-based interaction, making the interface \\"three-dimensional\\" by adding visual depth through the use of monocular cues, and even combining depth with physics. The latter resulted in the development of BumpTop desktop and its acquisition and release by Google.

His 1947 book, Darwin's Finches, on the finches of the Galapagos Islands was a landmark work as were his other popular science books on Life of the Robin and Swifts in a Tower. He developed what is now known as Lack's Principle which explained the evolution of avian clutch sizes in terms of individual selection as opposed to the competing contemporary idea that they had evolved for the benefit of species (also known as group selection). His pioneering life-history studies of the living bird helped in changing the nature of ornithology from what was then a collection-oriented field. He was a longtime director of the Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology at the University of Oxford. Education and early life Lack was born in London, the oldest of four children of Harry Lambert Lack MD FRCS, who later became President of the British Medical Association. The name 'Lack' is derived from 'Lock'. His father grew up in a farming family from Norfolk and became a leading ear, nose and throat surgeon at the London Hospital. Although his father had some interest in birds as a boy it does not appear that he influenced David's interest. His mother Kathleen was the daughter of Lt. Col. McNeil Rind of the Indian army. Kathleen's father was Scottish and on her mother's side was part Irish, Greek and Georgian. Kathleen had been an actor and was a supporter of women's suffrage. At home they organized meetings of the poetry society. David was schooled at home until seven and then went to the Open Air School in Regent's Park before going to The Hall, Hampstead followed by Foster's School, Stubbington and Gresham's School, Holt, Norfolk. Lack was taught biology at Gresham's by W.H. Foy and G.H. Lockett.Anderson (2013):6-9. He went to Magdalene College, Cambridge and received a BA second class in 1933 after studying botany, zoology and geology for part I of the Tripos and zoology for part II.Anderson (2013):15. Until the age of fifteen, Lack lived in a large house in Devonshire Place, London. The family spent their summers in New Romney Kent where Lack became familiar with the local birds especially on Romney Marsh.Anderson (2013):6-7. By the age of nine, he had learnt the names of most birds and had written out an alphabetically arranged life-list. In 1926, Lack won the Holland-Martin Natural History Prize for an essay on \\"Three Birds of Kelling Heath\\".Anderson (2013):12. In 1928, with an essay on 'My favourite birds' he was the national winner of the senior prize (a silver medal) in the Public School Essay Competition, organised by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.\\"Public School Essay Competition\\", The Times, 17 December 1928; p. 12; Issue 45078; col C David did not wish to follow his father's profession in medicine and took an interest in zoology. His father then considered entomology which was then the only professional field in zoology and found work for David at the Frankfurt museum in the summer of 1929. He spent four months pinning insects in the Senckenberg Museum and fount it ‚Äúextremely‚Äù boring.Anderson (2013):14. He joined the Cambridge Ornithological Club whose members included Peter Scott, Arthur Duncan, Dominic Serventy, and Tom Harrisson. His first scientific paper was on the display of nightjars, published in the Ibis in 1932. He joined on several expeditions with Cambridge researchers including two to the Arctic.Anderson (2013):17-18. Lack wrote The Birds of Cambridgeshire (1934) which was published by the Cambridge Bird Club. In this work, he departed from the contemporary style with a distinct de-emphasis on rare and accidental birds.Anderson (2013):3. Lack received an Sc.D. from Cambridge University in 1948. Career and research After Cambridge, Lack, on the recommendation of Julian Huxley took up a position as a science mentor at Dartington Hall School,Anderson (2013):27-28. Devonshire from 1934 until Summer 1938 when he took a year off to study bird behaviour on the Galapagos Islands. In 1935 he made his first trip to the United States as a chaperone for a Dartington Hall student returning to California. Here he met Joseph Grinnell and Robert McCabe and gave a talk at the Cooper Ornithological Club. In New York, he met Ernst Mayr at the American Museum of Natural History. He returned via the SS Bremen, only one of about four English speakers on the German ship.Anderson (2013):43-45. He was only in the Galapagos for part of that year, starting August 1938. With the data that he collected in the Galapagos, especially on the finches he went to the United States. April to August 1939 was spent at the California Academy of Sciences which held a large collection of the finches of Galapagos that had been studied earlier by Harry Swarth and at Ernst Mayr's home in New Jersey. While in the US he made a study of the tricoloured blackbird with John T. Emlen.Anderson (2013):58-59. He returned home in September 1939, after the outbreak of war.Provine, William B (1986) Sewall Wright and evolutionary biology. Chicago. p. 406 Lack published The Galapagos Finches (Geospizinae), A Study in Variation in which he examined variations within species across islands and considered that many of them were non-adaptive and due to founder effect and genetic drift.Anderson (2013):59-60. Lack's first major work was The Life of the Robin, which was based on four years of field work that he conducted while teaching at Dartington Hall School. He examined robin behaviour, song, territory, pairing and breeding using ringing to mark and track individual birds.Anderson (2013):25-27. The manuscript was completed in 1942 and it went through five editions from 1943 to 1970. One of Lack's students at Dartington Hall was Eva Ibbotson. A colleague who helped in filming some of the robins for Lack was the geography teacher Bill Hunter. In 1934 Lack went to Tanganyika on an invitation from R.E. Moreau.Anderson (2013):34-35. The Common Swift, one of many subjects studied by Lack. Lack was committed to pacificism and debated the philosophy even during his Dartington days with the founder of the college, Leonard Knight Elmhirst. During World War II Lack however served with a British Army unit called the Army Operational Research Group on the Orkney Islands working on radar use. During this work he met other biologists who had been inducted into the war including George Varley, an entomologist who introduced him to the idea of density-dependent regulation of animal populations.Anderson (2013):47. Lack's observations on spurious echoes produced by birds would later allow him to establish the field of radar ornithology to study bird migration.Anderson (2013):48-49. Lack was released from wartime duty in August 1945 so as to take a position to as Director (succeeding W.B. Alexander) of the Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology at Oxford University, a position that he held until his death in 1973. Lack's work in ornithology was almost entirely based on studies of the living bird. He was one of the pioneers of life-history studies in Britain, especially those based on quantitative approaches, when some traditional ornithologists of the time were focussing their studies on morphology and geographic distribution. Lack's major scientific research included work on population biology and density dependent regulation. His work suggested that natural selection favoured clutch sizes that ensured the greatest number of surviving young. This interpretation was however debated by V.C. Wynne-Edwards who suggested that clutch size was density-independent. This was one of the earliest debates on group selection. Lack's studies were based on nidicolous birds and some recent studies have suggested that his findings may not hold for other groups such as seabirds. As a mentor for numerous doctoral students, Lack followed a hands-off method, letting students decide their own research topics. He encouraged students to sort out their ideas and find the \\"simplest explanation, which was probably best.\\" He would make students work on their papers and give only one reading to their thesis asking them to choose either a draft or a final version to submit.Anderson (2013):159-160. He wrote numerous papers in ornithological journals, and had a knack of choosing memorable titles: he once claimed to have single-handedly caused the renaming of a group of birds through the submission of a scientific paper with the title \\"Territory and Polygamy in a Bishop\\". This 1935 publication was subsequently titled \\"Territory and polygamy in a bishop bird, Euplectes hordeacea hordeacea (Linn.)\\" in the journal Ibis as the journal editor felt that the title might cause misunderstanding.Anderson (2013):39. = Darwin's finches = Lack's most famous work is Darwin's Finches, a landmark study whose title linked Darwin's name with the Galapagos group of species and popularised the term \\"Darwin's finches\\" in 1947, though the term had been introduced by Percy Lowe in 1936. There are two versions of this work, differing significantly in their conclusions. The first is a book-length monograph, written after his visit to the Galapagos, but not published until 1945. In it Lack interprets the differences in bill size as species recognition signals, that is, as isolating mechanisms. The second is the later book in which the differences in bill size are interpreted as adaptations to specific food niches, an interpretation that has since been abundantly confirmed.Lack, David 1947. Darwin's Finches. Cambridge University Press reissued in 1961 by Harper, New York, with a new preface by Lack; reissued in 1983 by Cambridge University Press with an introduction and notes by Laurene M. Ratcliffe and Peter T. Boag). This change of mind, according to Lack's Preface, came about as a result of his reflections on his own data whilst he was doing war work. The effect of this change in interpretation is to put the emphasis for speciation onto natural selection for appropriate food handling instead of seeing it primarily as a by-product of an isolating mechanism. In this way his work contributed to the modern evolutionary synthesis, in which natural selection came to be seen as the prime mover in evolution, and not random or mutational events. Lack's work laid the foundations for the much more extensive work of Peter and Rosemary Grant and their colleagues.Grant, Peter R. 1999. Ecology and evolution of Darwin's finches. Princeton NJ. Lack's work feeds into studies of island biogeography which continue the same range of issues presented by the Galapagos fauna on a more varied canvas.MacArthur R. and Wilson E.O. 1967. The theory of island biogeography. Princeton 1967. According to Ernst Mayr, :\\"The person who more than anyone else deserves credit for reviving an interest in the ecological significance of species was David Lack... It is now quite clear that the process of speciation is not completed by the acquisition of isolating mechanisms but requires also the acquisition of adaptations that permit co-existence with potential competitors.\\"Mayr, Ernst (1985). The growth of biological thought: diversity, evolution, and inheritance. Harvard University Press. , pp. 274‚Äì5. =Lack's Principle= In 1943 Lack took an interest in clutch size after reading Moreau's manuscript sent to the Ibis. Lack was then an assistant to the editor of the Ibis.Anderson (2013):62. Lack postulated what is now known as Lack's Principle, which states that \\"the clutch size of each species of bird has been adapted by natural selection to correspond with the largest number of young for which the parents can, on average, provide enough food\\".Lack D (1954) The regulation of animal numbers. Clarendon Press, Oxford = Population regulation = Lack took a keen interest in the mechanisms involved in regulating populations in nature. The Natural Regulation of Animal Numbers is one of Lack's most frequently cited works. Here he gave primacy to natural selection in determining the rate of reproduction and he especially countered the idea that it was adjusted with mortality rates so that constant populations are maintained. It was critiqued by J.B.S. Haldane who found it lacking mathematical precision and biased to bird studies. The other major critic was V.C. Wynne-Edwards with whom he clashed for nearly a decade.Anderson (2013):78-81.

The centenary of Lack's birth, 16 July 2010, was marked by a 'David Lack Centenary Symposium', hosted by the Edward Grey Institute. A programme of talks focused on and celebrated the scientific contributions of Lack to ornithology, and the broader fields of ecology and evolution, and assessed the development of these fields in the 21st century. Personal life David Lack married Elizabeth Lack (n√©e Silva) who was also an ornithologist. Elizabeth Silva was born in Hertfordshire in 1916 and took an early interest in music. She wished to joined the Royal Academy of Music in London but the war led to her serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service as an ambulance driver in Europe. After the war she applied for work and due to her interest in birds she sent her resume to Richard Fitter who passed it on to David Lack with a note \\"Here's another for your reject file.\\" Lack however interviewed her and appointed her as a secretary. Noting her interest in birds, he also invited her to serve as a field assistant for studies in the Wytham Woods. She also helped in the study of swifts. One day Elizabeth did not return to her office after her observations of the swifts and David, worried that she might have fallen off a ladder, found her engrossed in observation. They became engaged in 1948 and were married on July 9, 1949. The best man was George Varley.Anderson (2013):105-107. They had four children: Peter Lack (born 1952, a biologist), Andrew Lack (born 1953, also a biologist and academic), Paul Lack (born 1957, a freelance teacher), and Catherine Lack (born 1959, a university chaplain). In Oxford, the Lacks initially lived in a flat in Park Town, Oxford, and later on Boars Hill, just south of Oxford. Lack enjoyed music and was also a fan of field hockey and tennis in which he also participated.Anderson (2013):119-107. Lack died from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma despite radiation treatments.Anderson (2013):214-215. =Religious beliefs= Lack's parents belonged to the Church of England and he was an agnostic as an early adult but became a convert to Anglicanism in 1948, possibly influenced by Dan and Mary Neylan, friends at Dartington Hall.Anderson (2013):127. He sought to find a compromise between science and religion and wrote, in 1957, Evolutionary theory and Christian belief, on the relationship between Christian faith and evolutionary theory. Lack believed that evolution could not account for morality, truth, beauty, free will, self-awareness and individual responsibility.Anderson (2013):123-124. This book foreshadows, in some ways, the non-overlapping magisteria conception of the relationship between religion and science later popularised by Stephen Jay Gould. Arthur Cain remarked of him \\"David Lack was the only religious man I knew at that period who did not allow his religion to dictate his view of natural selection.\\"Cain, A. J. and Provine, W. B.

The Electronic Product Code (EPC) is designed as a universal identifier that provides a unique identity for every physical object anywhere in the world, for all time. The EPC structure is defined in the EPCglobal Tag Data Standard , which is an open standard freely available for download from the website of EPCglobal, Inc.. The canonical representation of an EPC is a URI, namely the 'pure-identity URI' representation that is intended for use when referring to a specific physical object in communications about EPCs among information systems and business application software. The EPCglobal Tag Data Standard also defines additional representations of an EPC identifier, such as the tag-encoding URI format and a compact binary format suitable for storing an EPC identifier efficiently within RFID tags (for which the low-cost passive RFID tags typically have limited memory capacity available for the EPC/UII memory bank). The EPCglobal Tag Data Standard defines the structure of the URI syntax and binary format, as well as the encoding and decoding rules to allow conversion between these representations. The EPC is designed as a flexible framework that can support many existing coding schemes, including many coding schemes currently in use with barcode technology. EPC identifiers currently support 7 identification keys from the GS1 system of identifiers, as well as a General Identifier and EPC identifiers that can be used for encoding supplies to the US Department of Defense. EPCs are not designed exclusively for use with RFID data carriers. They can indeed be constructed based on reading of optical data carriers, such as linear bar codes and two-dimensional bar codes, such as Data Matrix symbols. The 'pure identity URI' canonical representation of an EPC is agnostic to the data carrier technology that was used to attach the unique identifier to the individual physical object. The EPC is designed to meet the needs of various industries, while guaranteeing uniqueness for all EPC- compliant tags. Some of the existing GS1 identification keys (such as the Global Returnable Asset Identifier (GRAI)) already provide for unique identification of individual objects. However, the Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) only identifies the product type or stock-keeping unit (SKU) rather than an individual instance of a particular product type. To ensure that an EPC always uniquely identifies an individual physical object, in the case of a GTIN, the EPC is constructed as a Serialised Global Trade Item Number (SGTIN) by combining a GTIN product identifier with a unique serial number. Both the Universal Product Code and EAN-13 identifiers that are still found on many trade items can be mapped into a 14-digit GTIN identifier, by padding to the left with zero digits to reach a total of 14 digits. An SGTIN EPC identifier can therefore be constructed by combining the resulting GTIN with a unique serial number and following the encoding rules in the EPCglobal Tag Data Standard. The EPC accommodates existing coding schemes and defines new schemes where necessary. Each coding scheme within the EPC identifier framework is distinguished through the use of a separate namespace. In the URI notations, this is indicated using a URI prefix such as \`urn:epc:id:sgtin\` or \`urn:epc:id:sscc\` In the compact binary encoding of an EPC identifier, the namespace is instead indicated using a compact binary header (typically the first 8 bits of the binary encoding of an EPC identifier). The EPCglobal Tag Data Standard provides details of the URI prefixes and corresponding binary header values. Low-cost passive RFID tags were designed to uniquely identify each item manufactured. In contrast, bar codes for trade items and consumer products have limited capacity and typically only identify the manufacturer and class of products. Although RFID tags are currently still more expensive than a simple optically readable label, they offer additional capabilities such as the ability to be read by radio waves, without requiring 'line of sight' between the reader or interrogator and the tag; this enables individual items within a large cardboard box (case) to be read without first unpacking each individual item from the box. Some RFID tags offer additional read/write user memory that could be used for storage of additional information, such as an expiry date or date of manufacture. The EPC tag will never entirely replace both plain text and barcoding, as liability obligations for the producer require durable and sufficiently fail-safe labels. Currently (2010) there are no applications in which RFID tags have completely replaced conventional labeling. The EPC was the creation of the MIT Auto-ID Center, a consortium of over 120 global corporations and university labs. EPC identifiers were designed to identify each item manufactured, as opposed to just the manufacturer and class of products, as bar codes do today. The EPC system is currently managed by EPCglobal, Inc., a subsidiary of GS1. The specifications for the EPC identifiers can be found in the EPCglobal, Inc. Tag Data Standard, which is an open standard, freely available for anyone to download. The Electronic Product Code is one of the industrial standards for global RFID usage, and a core element of the EPCglobal Network, an architecture of open standards developed by the GS1 EPCglobal community. Most currently deployed EPC RFID tags comply with ISO/IEC 18000-6C for the RFID air interface standard.  Structure  The canonical representation of an EPC is a URI - the 'pure-identity URI' that is intended for use when referring to a specific physical object in communications about EPCs among information systems and business application software. Each coding scheme within the EPC identifier framework is distinguished through the use of a separate namespace. In the URI notations, this is indicated using a URI prefix such as \`urn:epc:id:sgtin\` or \`urn:epc:id:sscc\` In the compact binary encoding of an EPC identifier, the namespace is instead indicated using a compact binary header (typically the first 8 bits of the binary encoding of an EPC identifier). The EPCglobal Tag Data Standard provides details of the URI prefixes and corresponding binary header values. This namespace indicator (URI prefix or compact binary header value) in turn dictates the length, type and structure of the EPC. EPC encoding schemes are used to uniquely identify one object. Most EPCs include an element within their structure that corresponds to a serial number. EPC Version 1.3 supports the following alternative coding schemes: * General Identifier (GID) GID-96 * a serialized version of the GS1 Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) SGTIN-96 SGTIN-198 * GS1 Serial Shipping Container Code (SSCC) SSCC-96 * GS1 Global Location Number (GLN), SGLN-96 SGLN-195 * GS1 Global Returnable Asset Identifier (GRAI) GRAI-96 GRAI-170 * GS1 Global Individual Asset Identifier (GIAI) GIAI-96 GIAI-202 and * DOD Construct DoD-96 From Version 1.4 these new coding schemas are also additionally supported: * Global Service Relation Number (GSRN) GSRN-96 * Global Document Type Identifier (GDTI) GDTI-96 As of January 2014, the current version of the Tag Data Standard is v1.8, which additionally defines the formatting of the Tag Identifier (TID) memory bank and how to use Packed Objects for the formatting of additional data within the user memory bank.

The music used in the film was composed by Iain Ballamy. It was produced by The Jim Henson Company. The film's story revolves around a young girl named Helena Campbell, who is sick of her family's career as circus performers. Helena's mother is hospitalized after they have an argument, and Helena finds herself trapped in a fantasy world shortly after. Gaiman and McKean worked on the film concepts over the course of two weeks at Jim Henson's family's home, and actual production of the film took seventeen months. Created on a budget of $4 million, the film was originally made as a direct-to-video film, but had a limited theatrical run in the United States on September 30, 2005, resulting in a domestic theatrical gross of $867,000. The film was also screened at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival where it received positive responses. The overall critical reaction to the film was mixed, with critics praising the film's visuals while complaining about the overall story and script. Plot Helena (Stephanie Leonidas) works with her parents (Gina McKee and Rob Brydon) at their family circus, but desires to run away and join real life. At the next performance, after Helena and her mother have a heated argument, Helena's mother collapses and is taken to the hospital. Ten days later, while Helena is staying with her grandmother, she finds that the doctors determine that Helena's mother requires an operation, and Helena can only blame herself for the situation. That night, she wakes up in a dream-like state and leaves her building to find three performers outside. As they try to perform for Helena, a shadow encroaches on the area and two of the performers are consumed by it. The third performer, Valentine (Jason Barry), a juggler, helps to quickly direct Helena to safety through the use of magical flying books. She learns they are in the City of Light which is slowly being consumed by shadows, causing its widely varied citizens to flee. Soon Helena is mistaken for the Princess. She and Valentine are taken to the Prime Minister (Brydon). He explains that the Princess from the Land of Shadow stole a charm from the White City, leaving their Queen of Light (McKee) in a state of unnatural sleep and the City vulnerable to the Shadows. Helena notes the resemblance of the Queen and Minister to her mother and father, and offers to help recover the charm along with Valentine. They are unaware their actions are being watched by the Queen of Shadows (also McKee) who has mistaken Helena for her daughter. Helena and Valentine attempt to stay ahead of the shadows as they follow clues to the charm, learning that it is called the \\"MirrorMask\\". Helena discovers that by looking through the windows of the buildings, she can see into her bedroom in the real world, through the drawings of windows that she created and hung on the wall of her room. She discovers that a doppelg√§nger of herself is living there and behaving radically differently from her. The doppelganger soon becomes aware of her presence in the drawings and begins to destroy them, causing parts of the fantasy world to collapse. Valentine betrays Helena to the Queen of Shadows in exchange for a large reward of jewels. The Queen's servants warp Helena's mind so she will believe she is the Princess of Shadows. Valentine has a change of heart and returns to the Queen's palace, and helps Helena to break the spell on her. They search the Princess' room, and Helena discovers the MirrorMask hidden in the Princess' mirror. They flee the castle with the charm. As they escape to Valentine's flying tower, Helena realizes that her doppelganger in the real world is the Princess of Shadows, who had used the MirrorMask to step through the windows in Helena's drawings. The Princess destroys the rest of the drawings in Helena's room, preventing Helena from returning, and Helena and Valentine disappear in the collapsed world. The Princess takes the drawings to the building's roof to disperse the shreds into the wind, but discovers one more drawing Helena had made on the back of the roof door. Helena successfully returns to the real world, sending the Princess back to her realm. At the same time, the Queen of Light finally awakens and the two Cities are restored to their natural balance. Helena returns to her apartment to learn that her mother's operation was successful; Helena returns to happily help at the circus. Sometime later, Helena becomes fascinated by a young man, strongly resembling Valentine, who wants to be a juggler for the circus. Cast * Stephanie Leonidas as Helena Campbell, a young circus performer and aspiring artist who is drawn into a mysterious world of masked people and monsters shortly after her mother is hospitalized. It is eventually revealed that the world she entered was created through her own drawings that she hung up on the walls of her room. Leonidas stated that she expected that filming would be difficult because most of the scenes were done with one or two other actors just with a bluescreen in the background, but also said that \\"it all came alive\\" for them when they started working. ** Leonidas also portrays The Princess, the rebellious daughter of the Queen of Shadows, who is Helena's parallel self. She uses the MirrorMask to switch places with Helena and hides it in her room. After escaping to the \\"real world\\", she takes advantage of her new freedom: dressing like a teenage punk, kissing boys, smoking, and arguing with Helena's father. * Jason Barry as Valentine, a juggler who keeps describing himself as a \\"very important man.\\" He becomes Helena's companion in the dream world, although he betrays Helena by handing her over to the Queen of Shadows. He regrets this decision, however, and returns to rescue Helena. He is very proud of his tower, though he mentions that he had an argument with it and that they parted ways. As he and Helena are being pursued by the Queen of Shadows, he calls the tower to aid their escape by shouting an apology to it. When Helena reawakens in her world, she meets him again auditioning as a juggler for the circus. * Rob Brydon as Morris Campbell, Helena's father. A juggler and ringmaster of his family circus, he is a gentle and kind man with an artistic temperament. He is frightened and overwhelmed by his wife's illness. Rob Brydon also plays the Queen of Light's majordomo. * Gina McKee as Joanne Campbell, Helena's mother. A circus acrobat and ticket-seller, Joanne collapses during a skit and is confined in the hospital shortly after having an argument with Helena. After successful operation, Joanne recovers and returns to circus life with her family. ** McKee also plays The Queen of Shadows, a possessive mother who treats her daughter like a pet. She mistakes Helena for the Princess who has run away, but when Helena reveals who she is, the Queen does not care as long as she has a daughter. ** McKee also plays The Queen of Light, a kind ruler. She falls into a deep sleep when the MirrorMask is stolen from her, leaving her city vulnerable to the Shadows. * The film also features appearances by Dora Bryan and the voices of Stephen Fry, Lenny Henry, Robert Llewellyn, and others. Production =Development= Executive producer Michael Polis mentioned that the idea of creating MirrorMask began when The Jim Henson Company and Sony Pictures expressed interest in making a film that would sell as well in video release as Labyrinth and The Dark Crystal based on the two films' consistent DVD sales in 1999. They had considered creating a prequel to Dark Crystal and sequels for Labyrinth, but decided that \\"it made the most sense to try and create something similar or in the spirit of those films and attribute it as a Jim Henson Company fantasy title.\\" After being shown a short film directed by McKean, Lisa Henson contacted Gaiman in 2001 about the project, asking if McKean would be interested in directing and if Gaiman was interested in coming up with the story for the film. Gaiman agreed to write for the film if McKean agreed to direct. Production for the film took seventeen months, with a budget of $4 million. Though limited by the $4 million budget, McKean viewed this as a good thing, saying \\"It's very good to have a box to fight against, and to know where your limitations are, because it immediately implies a certain kind of thing... a certain kind of shape... a certain approach to things.\\" =Setting= According to McKean, the film's setting was originally in London, but that had opted to film it in Brighton at producer Simon Moorhead's suggestion. McKean described Brighton as \\"more bohemian, so that fits with the whole circus thing, with Helena‚Äôs family\\", and that he liked the specific apartment building - Embassy Court - that they used because \\"it‚Äôs very distinctive, imposing, it does have this character, but it also represents Helena‚Äôs collapse and her disintegration into this other world and it‚Äôs a potent symbol for her mother.\\" =Writing= McKean and Gaiman worked on the story and concepts for the film over a span of two weeks in February 2002 at the Henson's family home. Gaiman stated that he wanted to do \\"a sort of Prince and Pauper idea. Something with a girl who was somehow split into two girls who became one at the end.\\" He went on to say that he \\"had an idea of a girl who was part of a traveling theatre and her mother getting sick and having to go off the road\\", and mentioned that McKean preferred to have a circus over a theatre \\"because it was more interesting visually.\\" McKean was the one who came up with the idea of the masks and the two mothers. McKean said that Labyrinth provided something of a starting point for the project, and that he liked the \\"human element of that film,\\" but that ultimately the story of MirrorMask was something that he and Gaiman came up with on their own. Gaiman wrote the screenplay in February 2002, and said that they always knew that it would be a coming of age story about a girl on a quest, but that later they learned \\"that it really was just the story of the relationship between a girl and her mother.\\" =Design= Polis initially spoke to both McKean and Brian Froud, the concept artist for Labyrinth and The Dark Crystal. The initial intention was to have McKean direct the film with Froud doing the designs, but Polis stated that it \\"made more sense\\" to have McKean do the designs seeing as he was the one directing the film. Since they had a tight budget, McKean designed creatures who were comparatively simple. He assigned entire sequences rather than tiny pieces to individual artists, so that the young professionals working on the film would have the creative opportunity to make part of it their own. He worked with them very closely in a single room. About the animators, he said that, \\"All but two were straight from art school and almost all from Bournemouth. We took half the class. They all knew each other already.\\" McKean says that one example of the spirit of the film is that they only had one peach during the filming of the scene where Valentine eats the future fruit. Artist Ian Miller also contributed to the designs of trees and certain other objects in the film, and also provided some of the illustrations pinned to Helena's bedroom wall. =Music= The music used in the film was composed by Iain Ballamy, McKean's friend whom he describes as \\"one of Europe's best sax players\\" and \\"a terrific composer.\\" McKean stated that he \\"wanted a musical landscape that never quite settled on anywhere geographically or time-wise as well.\\" He also noted that Ballamy has composed music for and performed in circuses before, and that \\"[h]e just seemed to be perfect for it.\\" McKean said that they could not afford to have a full orchestra due to budget constraints, but that they commissioned several of Ballamy's contacts to help record the music. Digital recordings were used with the aid of Ashley Slater, but McKean stated that most of the instruments used were real. Swedish singer Josefine Cronholm provided the vocals for the songs used in the film. The circus band are musicians from Farmers Market. The film's soundtrack, containing thirty tracks of background music and songs used in the film, was released by La-La Land Records in 2005. Release The film was first screened at a high school, where it got a positive response. The film also received positive reactions when it was screened at the Sundance Film Festival. The film was originally made for a direct-to-video release, but had its limited theatrical release on September 30, 2005, in the United States. The North American DVD was released on February 14, 2006. The DVD contains additional content such as commentaries, interviews, behind-the- scenes clips, and an art gallery. The film was listed as #31 on the Billboard Top DVD Sales chart the week of March 11, 2006. Neil Gaiman commented that the DVD sold \\"better than expected\\" and that it was \\"gathering an audience\\". Reception = Box office = The film earned a total domestic gross of $866,999, earning $126,449 on its opening weekend. = Critical response = The film received mixed reactions from critics, was given a 54% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 89 reviews. Metacritic gave the film a weighted average score of 55% based on 27 reviews. Critic Roger Ebert gave the film two out of four stars, praising the film's visual artistry but stating that there is \\"no narrative engine to pull us past the visual scenery\\", and that he \\"suspected the filmmakers began with a lot of ideas about how the movie should look, but without a clue about pacing, plotting or destination.\\" Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a rating of A-, saying that the film is a \\"dazzling reverie of a kids-and-adults movie, an unusual collaboration between lord-of-the-cult multimedia artist Dave McKean and king- of-the-comics Neil Gaiman (The Sandman)\\" and that it \\"has something to astonish everyone.\\" Stephen Holden of The New York Times described the film's look as \\"hazy, indistinct, sepia-tinted, overcrowded and flat\\", and that \\"its monochromatic panoramas are too busy and flat to yield an illusion of depth or to convey a feeling of characters moving in space.\\" He went on to say that the film is \\"The embodiment of a cult film, one destined for a rich life on home video\\". Desson Thomson of The Washington Post described the film as \\"so single-minded in its reach for fantasy, it becomes the genre's evil opposite: banality.\\" = Award nominations = The film was nominated for the Golden Groundhog Award for Best Underground Movie, other nominated films were Lexi Alexander's Green Street, Rodrigo Garc√≠a's Nine Lives, the award-winning baseball documentary Up for Grabs and Opie Gets Laid. Other media In 2005, Tokyopop, in partnership with The Jim Henson Company, announced plans to publish a manga-style comic prequel to the film, which would center around the Princess' escape from the Dark Palace and how she acquired the MirrorMask. The manga was reportedly canceled in 2007. A children's book based on the film, authored by Gaiman and illustrated by McKean, was published by HarperCollins Children's Books in September 2005. An audiobook based on the children's book has also been released by HarperCollins in December 2005. A book containing the film's complete storyboard and script as well as some photographs and archival text by Gaiman and McKean, titled The Alchemy of MirrorMask, was also published by HarperCollins in November 2005. The band The Cr√ºxshadows wrote and performed \\"Wake the White Queen\\", which retells the story of MirrorMask. This track appears on the Neil Gaiman-inspired compilation album, Where's Neil When You Need Him? Dark Horse Comics released a number of MirrorMask related merchandise in 2005. Three PVC figure sets, which included three figures per set, were released from May to June 2005. These sets included figures of characters such as Helena, Valentine, the Dark Queen, as well as figures of minor characters like the Librarian and the Small Hairy Guy. A journal made to look like the Really Useful Book, which provided aid for Helena in the film, was released in July 2005, and a seven-inch tall bust of the Dark Queen was released in August 2005.

She was built during World War II but not completed until after the end of the war and in use for only a few years. Huntington was launched by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden, New Jersey, on 8 April 1945, sponsored by Mrs. M. L. Jarrett, Jr., and commissioned 23 February 1946, Captain Donald Rex Tallman in command. Service history After shakedown training off Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba, Huntington sailed from Philadelphia on 23 July 1946 for duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. During the cruise she visited many ports, including Naples, Malta, Villefranche, and Alexandria, helping to stabilize the volatile post-war situation in Europe. Departing Gibraltar on 8 February 1947, she took part in exercises off Guant√°namo Bay, stopped at Norfolk and Newport, Rhode Island, and departed the latter port 20 May 1947 for another tour of duty in the Mediterranean. Returning from her cruise on 13 September 1947, Huntington departed Philadelphia on 24 October with Naval Reserve personnel for exercises off Bermuda and Newfoundland until 14 November 1947. The ship then entered Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and underwent an extensive overhaul until 12 April 1948. During that period Captain Arleigh Burke, future CNO, assumed command in December 1947 until December 1948. Returning to Norfolk on 27 April from her refresher training cruise in the Caribbean, Huntington sailed to Newport and departed for another tour of duty in the Mediterranean on 1 June 1948. Huntington visited a variety of ports during June to August 1948, and after transiting the Suez Canal on 22 September, embarked on a good will tour of Africa and South America, arriving Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 6 November. There the ship was honored by an official visit from President Juan Per√≥n, and continuing to Uruguay received a similar visit from President Luis Berres on 10 November. Huntington called at Rio de Janeiro and Trinidad before returning from this valuable good will cruise on 8 December 1948. The cruiser made one short cruise from Philadelphia to the Caribbean, returned to Newport on 22 January, and decommissioned on 15 June 1949. She was finally struck from the Navy List on 1 September 1961 after being in reserve, and was sold to Boston Metals, Baltimore, Maryland, on 16 May 1962.

It has two subspecies: H. s. smithii, which occurs throughout Africa, and H. s. filifera, which is found in southern and southeastern Asia. It is mainly resident, but populations in Pakistan and northern India migrate further south in winter. The genus name Hirundo is the Latin word for swallow.Jobling (2010), p. 193. The species name smithii commemorates Christen Smith, a Norwegian botanist and geologist.Jobling (2010), p. 358. Description The wire-tailed swallow is a small swallow, measuring in length. It has bright blue upperparts, bright white underparts and a chestnut cap. Immature birds lack tail wires, and have dull brown (rather than chestnut) caps. The species is named for the very long filamentous outermost tail feathers, which trail behind like two wires. The sexes are similar in appearance, but the female has shorter \\"wires\\". Juveniles have a brown crown, back and tail. The Asian form, H. s. filifera, is larger and longer-tailed than the abundant African H. s. smithii. Habits This bird is found in open country near water and human habitation. Wire-tailed swallows are fast flyers and they generally feed on insects, especially flies, while airborne. They are typically seen low over water, with which they are more closely associated than most swallows. Nesting The neat half-bowl nests are lined with mud collected in the swallows' beaks. They are placed on vertical surfaces near water under cliff ledges or nowadays more commonly on man-made structures such as buildings and bridges. The clutch is three to four eggs in Africa, up to five in Asia (Turner and Rose). These birds are solitary and territorial nesters, unlike many swallows, which tend to be colonial. Taxonomy and systematics The wire-tailed swallow is a member of the genus Hirundo, a cosmopolitan group of \\"barn swallows\\". It has two subspecies: * H. s. smithii was first described by William Elford Leach and K. D. Koenig in 1818. Known as the African wire-tailed swallow, it is found throughout Africa. * H. s. filifera was first described by Stephens in 1826. Also known as the Asian wire-tailed swallow, it is found in southern and southeastern Asia.

He was a pioneering ornithologist who described numerous species of birds in India. Several species of plants (including the genus Jerdonia) and birds including Jerdon's baza, Jerdon's leafbird, Jerdon's bushlark, Jerdon's nightjar, Jerdon's courser, Jerdon's babbler and Jerdon's bush chat are named after him. Early life Thomas was the eldest son of Archibald Jerdon of Bonjedward, near Jedburgh, and was born at Biddick House in County Durham. His early education was at Bishopton Grove near Ripon and later at Bawtry near Doncaster. His father influenced an interest in natural history and although not a well-known naturalist, he was a careful observer and while Thomas took an interest mainly in zoology, his younger brother became an active botanist. Thomas joined Edinburgh University in 1828 as a literary student but attended classes in natural history by Professor Robert Jameson. He joined the Plinian Society, an association of naturalists (another member of which was Charles Darwin), on 23 June 1829. He graduated as a medical student in 1829-1830 and continued medical studies before obtaining an assistant surgeonship in the East India Company's service. He was appointed on 11 September 1835 and he arrived at Madras on 21 February 1836. India Jerdon (second from left) and other naturalists His initial work in India was in dealing with fever and dysentery that affected the troops posted in the Ganjam district. During this posting, he described the birds of the Eastern Ghats. On 1 March 1837 he moved to the 2nd Light Cavalry and was posted at Trichinopoly and moved with the regiment to Jalnah in central India. He remained in the Deccan region for the next four years. In 1841 he visited the Nilgiri Hills on leave and in July of the same year he married Flora Alexandrina Matilda Macleod, niece of General Lewis Wentworth Watson. Flora had an interest in botanical art and took an interest in orchids. She was also an excellent guitarist. Around 1845 the Jerdon's lived in their Ooty home Woodside, (Woodside originally belonged to General Watson) and their children were baptised at the local St. Stephens church. Six months later he was appointed Civil Surgeon of Nellore. At Nellore, he interacted with the Yanadi tribes and obtained information on local names of birds and studied the natural history of the area. On 25 October 1844 he was transferred to Fort St. George as Garrison Assistant-Surgeon. During this time he took an interest in the fishes of the Bay of Bengal. On 12 February 1847 he was appointed Civil Surgeon of Tellicherry. This position led him to describe many species from the Malabar region including ants such as the distinctive Harpegnathos saltator. He resigned from civil charge on 3 June 1851 and was promoted as Surgeon with the 4th Light Cavalry in Sagar on 29 February 1852. After peace regained following the 1857 revolts, he was made Surgeon Major on 1 October 1858.London Gazette, 20 December 1864 PDF He subsequently went to Darjeeling on sick leave and studied the Himalayan fauna before joining back into the 11th Native Infantry regiment in Burma and making use of that opportunity to study the region. Around 1861 a mission to Tibet was to be conducted by Captain E. Smythe and Jerdon was to accompany the group (which included Dr Stewart of the Saharanpur botanical garden; Capt. Bassevi, meteorologist; and Medlicott, geologist) as botanist but failure to obtain passports from Pekin led to the mission being cancelled. Around the same time Lord Canning enabled him to take special duty that would allow him to work on the publication of a series of books on the vertebrates of India. This began with his works on the Birds of India, followed by works on the mammals, reptiles and fish. On 28 February 1868 he retired from service and he was given the honorary position of Deputy Inspector-General of hospitals in Madras on 28 October 1868.London Gazette 27 October 1868 PDF While still in Gauhati, Assam he suffered a severe attack of fever and moved to Calcutta to convalesce but his condition deteriorated leading to his return to England in June 1870. In 1871 he became a member of the Berwickshire Natural History Society and joined them on walks. His health however continued to decline and he died at Aubyns Road, Upper Norwood on 12 June 1872, and was buried in West Norwood Cemetery.London Gazette. 13 August 1872. p. 3673 He discussed the birds of India with his friend Dresser even hours before his death. Flora died at her home in 40 Marina on 24 August 1910 and was buried at the Hastings Borough Cemetery. Natural history Jerdon started collecting birds almost immediately on arrival in India on 21 February 1836. He sent his collections of birds collected during his early travels to William Jardine for identification, but by the time they arrived at Jardine's house in Scotland they had become infested by moths. Jerdon trusted his own identifications from then on, publishing A Catalogue of the Birds of the Indian Peninsula for the Madras Journal of Literature and Science (1839‚Äì40). This included 420 species, almost doubling the list produced earlier by Colonel W. H. Sykes. Dedication page from the Birds of India > The want of brief, but comprehensive Manual of the Natural History of India > has been long felt by all interested in such inquiries. At the present, it > is necessary to search through voluminous transactions of learned Societies, > and scientific Journals, to obtain any general acquaintance with what has > been already ascertained regarding the Fauna of India, and, excepting to a > few more favorably placed, even these are inaccessible. The issue of a > Manual, which should comprise all available information in sufficient detail > for the discrimination and identification of such objects of Natural History > as might be met with, without being rendered cumbrous by minutiae of > synonymy or of history, has therefore long been considered a desideratum. > To meet this want it is proposed to publish a series of such Manuals for > all the Vertebrated Animals of India, containing characters of all the > classes, orders, families, and genera, and descriptions of all the species > of all Mammals, Birds, Reptiles, and Fishes, found in India. > Prospectus in his Birds of India regarding the proposed The Fauna of > British India, Including Ceylon and Burma. Jerdon's most important publication was The Birds of India (1862‚Äì64), which included over 1008 species in two volumes with the second volume in two parts. This work was dedicated to Lord Canning and Lord Elgin who supported the venture. This work was not without its critics. A reviewer pointed out that Jerdon seemed unaware of the significance of geographic distributions in evolutionary relatedness. Jerdon was an admirer of the Quinarian classification of Swainson. Jerdon's opinion on Darwin's theory was that it \\"perhaps, lays too much stress on external and fortuitous circumstances as producing varieties, and not enough on the inherent power of change.\\" The reviewer also pointed out problems in his usage of George Gray's arrangement of the bird classes and states: \\"In thus following the phantasies of Kaup, and the mad vagaries of Bonaparte (in his latest writings), we cannot believe that Dr. Jerdon has acted well for his own reputation, nor wisely as regards the class of readers for whom his volumes are specially intended.\\" Jerdon documented the local names of many birds although he did not follow a consistent spelling for Hindi and Urdu words. Jerdon's other major work was the Illustrations of Indian Ornithology in 1844, which included illustration made by Indian artists (some from Trichinopoly), about which he wrote in his later works: Other works included The Game Birds and Wildfowl of India (1864) and Mammals of India (1874). He had a wide interest in natural history and his studies include descriptions of plants, ants, amphibians, reptiles, birds as well as mammals. Jerdon was instrumental in the birth of The Fauna of British India, Including Ceylon and Burma series. The need for a work on the Indian fauna was felt and it was finally approved by the Secretary of state and was placed under the editorship of W. T. Blanford. R. A. Sterndale mentions a note from Jerdon on an otter that he kept as a pet (probably at Tellicherry) Impatiens jerdoniae was named after Flora Jerdon by Robert Wight His work on the reptiles of India was not completed and it was only after his death that the proofs were sent to his home. In 1874 several volumes with his original drawings of reptiles were auctioned by Messrs. Sotheby, Wilkinson and Hodge. Some of these illustrations were purchased by Lord Lilford. Apart from zoology, he also took an interest in botany, although he did not publish on the topic and instead communicated notes to botanists such as Robert Wight. Wight notes that: In his personal matters he was said to be careless and forgetful. He often had trouble with his creditors and during the time of his death he was found to be insolvent. Jerdon has also been noted as being rash. On one occasion, he tried catching a cobra by the tail and got bitten on the tip of finger which he slashed with a pocket knife. He was also nearly strangled by a pet python that he kept. Eponyms Jerdon is honored in the specific names of three species of lizards (Calotes jerdoni, Cnemaspis jerdonii, Ophisops jerdonii ) and three species of snakes (Hydrophis jerdonii, Protobothrops jerdonii, Indotyphlops jerdoni ).Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

In most mammals, it is the sensory system that provides the leading contribution to the sense of balance and spatial orientation for the purpose of coordinating movement with balance. Together with the cochlea, a part of the auditory system, it constitutes the labyrinth of the inner ear in most mammals. As movements consist of rotations and translations, the vestibular system comprises two components: the semicircular canals, which indicate rotational movements; and the otoliths, which indicate linear accelerations. The vestibular system sends signals primarily to the neural structures that control eye movement; these provide the anatomical basis of the vestibulo-ocular reflex, which is required for clear vision. Signals are also sent to the muscles that keep an animal upright and in general control posture; these provide the anatomical means required to enable an animal to maintain its desired position in space. The brain uses information from the vestibular system in the head and from proprioception throughout the body to enable the mammal to understand its body's dynamics and kinematics (including its position and acceleration) from moment to moment. How these two perceptive sources are integrated to provide the underlying structure of the sensorium is unknown. Semicircular canal system Cochlea and vestibular system The semicircular canal system detects rotational movements. The semicircular canals are its main tools to achieve this detection. =Structure= Since the world is three-dimensional, the vestibular system contains three semicircular canals in each labyrinth. They are approximately orthogonal (at right angles) to each other, and are the horizontal (or lateral), the anterior semicircular canal (or superior), and the posterior (or inferior) semicircular canal. Anterior and posterior canals may collectively be called vertical semicircular canals. *Movement of fluid within the horizontal semicircular canal corresponds to rotation of the head around a vertical axis (i.e. the neck), as when doing a pirouette. *The anterior and posterior semicircular canals detect rotations of the head in the sagittal plane (as when nodding), and in the frontal plane, as when cartwheeling. Both anterior and posterior canals are orientated at approximately 45¬∞ between frontal and sagittal planes. The movement of fluid pushes on a structure called the cupula which contains hair cells that transduce the mechanical movement to electrical signals. =Push-pull systems= Push-pull system of the semicircular canals, for a horizontal head movement to the right. The canals are arranged in such a way that each canal on the left side has an almost parallel counterpart on the right side. Each of these three pairs works in a push-pull fashion: when one canal is stimulated, its corresponding partner on the other side is inhibited, and vice versa. This push-pull system makes it possible to sense all directions of rotation: while the right horizontal canal gets stimulated during head rotations to the right (Fig 2), the left horizontal canal gets stimulated (and thus predominantly signals) by head rotations to the left. Vertical canals are coupled in a crossed fashion, i.e. stimulations that are excitatory for an anterior canal are also inhibitory for the contralateral posterior, and vice versa. =Vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR)= The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) is a reflex eye movement that stabilizes images on the retina during head movement by producing an eye movement in the direction opposite to head movement, thus preserving the image on the center of the visual field. For example, when the head moves to the right, the eyes move to the left, and vice versa. Since slight head movements are present all the time, the VOR is very important for stabilizing vision: patients whose VOR is impaired find it difficult to read, because they cannot stabilize the eyes during small head tremors. The VOR reflex does not depend on visual input and works even in total darkness or when the eyes are closed. The vestibulo-ocular reflex. A rotation of the head is detected, which triggers an inhibitory signal to the extraocular muscles on one side and an excitatory signal to the muscles on the other side. The result is a compensatory movement of the eyes. This reflex, combined with the push- pull principle described above, forms the physiological basis of the Rapid head impulse test or Halmagyi-Curthoys-test, in which the head is rapidly and forcefully moved to the side while observing whether the eyes keep looking in the same direction. =Mechanics= The mechanics of the semicircular canals can be described by a damped oscillator. If we designate the deflection of the cupula with \\\\theta, and the head velocity with \\\\dot q, the cupula deflection is approximately : \\\\theta (s) = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha s}{(T_1 s+1)(T_2 s+1)} \\\\dot{q} (s) Œ± is a proportionality factor, and s corresponds to the frequency. For humans, the time constants T1 and T2 are approximately 3 ms and 5 s, respectively. As a result, for typical head movements, which cover the frequency range of 0.1 Hz and 10 Hz, the deflection of the cupula is approximately proportional to the head-velocity. This is very useful since the velocity of the eyes must be opposite to the velocity of the head in order to maintain clear vision. =Central processing= Signals from the vestibular system also project to the cerebellum (where they are used to keep the VOR effective, a task usually referred to as learning or adaptation) and to different areas in the cortex. The projections to the cortex are spread out over different areas, and their implications are currently not clearly understood. =Projection pathways= The vestibular nuclei on either side of the brainstem exchange signals regarding movement and body position. These signals are sent down the following projection pathways. *To the cerebellum. Signals sent to the cerebellum are relayed back as muscle movements of the head, eyes, and posture. *To nuclei of cranial nerves III, IV, and VI. Signals sent to these nerves cause the vestibulo-ocular reflex. They allow for the eyes to fix on a moving object while staying in focus. *To the reticular formation. Signals sent to the reticular formation signal the new posture the body has taken on, and how to adjust circulation and breathing due to body position. *To the spinal cord. Signals sent to the spinal cord allow quick reflex reactions to both the limbs and trunk to regain balance. *To the thalamus. Signals sent to the thalamus allow for head and body motor control as well as being conscious of body position. Otolithic organs While the semicircular canals respond to rotations, the otolithic organs sense linear accelerations. Humans have two otolithic organs on each side, one called the utricle, the other called the saccule. The utricle contains a patch of hair cells and supporting cells called a macula. Similarly, the saccule contains a patch of hair cells and a macula. Each hair cell of a macula has 40-70 stereocilia and one true cilium called a kinocilium. The tips of these cilia are embedded in an otolithic membrane. This membrane is weighted down with protein-calcium carbonate granules called otoconia. These otoconia add to the weight and inertia of the membrane and enhance the sense of gravity and motion. With the head erect, the otolithic membrane bears directly down on the hair cells and stimulation is minimal. When the head is tilted, however, the otolithic membrane sags and bends the stereocilia, stimulating the hair cells. Any orientation of the head causes a combination of stimulation to the utricles and saccules of the two ears. The brain interprets head orientation by comparing these inputs to each other and to other input from the eyes and stretch receptors in the neck, thereby detecting whether the head is tilted or the entire body is tipping. Essentially, these otolithic organs sense how quickly you are accelerating forward or backward, left or right, or up or down. Most of the utricular signals elicit eye movements, while the majority of the saccular signals projects to muscles that control our posture. While the interpretation of the rotation signals from the semicircular canals is straightforward, the interpretation of otolith signals is more difficult: since gravity is equivalent to a constant linear acceleration, one somehow has to distinguish otolith signals that are caused by linear movements from those caused by gravity. Humans can do that quite well, but the neural mechanisms underlying this separation are not yet fully understood. Humans can sense head tilting and linear acceleration even in dark environments because of the orientation of two groups of hair cell bundles on either side of the striola. Hair cells on opposite sides move with mirror symmetry, so when one side is moved, the other is inhibited. The opposing effects caused by a tilt of the head cause differential sensory inputs from the hair cell bundles allow humans to tell which way the head is tilting, Sensory information is then sent to the brain, which can respond with appropriate corrective actions to the nervous and muscular systems to ensure that balance and awareness are maintained. Experience from the vestibular system Experience from the vestibular system is called equilibrioception. It is mainly used for the sense of balance and for spatial orientation. When the vestibular system is stimulated without any other inputs, one experiences a sense of self-motion. For example, a person in complete darkness and sitting in a chair will feel that he or she has turned to the left if the chair is turned to the left. A person in an elevator, with essentially constant visual input, will feel she is descending as the elevator starts to descend. There are a variety of direct and indirect vestibular stimuli which can make people feel they are moving when they are not, not moving when they are, tilted when they are not, or not tilted when they are.Lawson, B. D., & Riecke, B. E. (2014). The Perception of Body Motion. Handbook of Virtual Environments, CRC Press, 163-196. Although the vestibular system is a very fast sense used to generate reflexes, including the righting reflex, to maintain perceptual and postural stability, compared to the other senses of vision, touch and audition, vestibular input is perceived with delay. Pathologies Diseases of the vestibular system can take different forms, and usually induce vertigo and instability or loss of balance, often accompanied by nausea. The most common vestibular diseases in humans are vestibular neuritis, a related condition called labyrinthitis, M√©ni√®re's disease, and BPPV. In addition, the function of the vestibular system can be affected by tumors on the vestibulocochlear nerve, an infarct in the brain stem or in cortical regions related to the processing of vestibular signals, and cerebellar atrophy. When the vestibular system and the visual system deliver incongruous results, nausea often occurs. When the vestibular system reports movement but the visual system reports no movement, the motion disorientation is often called motion sickness (or seasickness, car sickness, simulation sickness, or airsickness). In the opposite case, such as when a person is in a zero-gravity environment or during a virtual reality session, the disoriented sensation is often called space sickness or space adaptation syndrome. Either of these \\"sicknesses\\" usually ceases once the congruity between the two systems is restored. Alcohol can also cause alterations in the vestibular system for short periods and will result in vertigo and possibly nystagmus due to the variable viscosity of the blood and the endolymph during the consumption of alcohol. The term for this is positional alcohol nystagmus (PAN): * PAN I - The alcohol concentration is higher in the blood than in the vestibular system, hence the endolymph is relatively dense. * PAN II - The alcohol concentration is lower in the blood than in the vestibular system, hence the endolymph is relatively dilute. PAN I will result in subjective vertigo in one direction and typically occurs shortly after ingestion of alcohol when blood alcohol levels are highest. PAN II will eventually cause subjective vertigo in the opposite direction. This occurs several hours after ingestion and after a relative reduction in blood alcohol levels. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a condition resulting in acute symptoms of vertigo. It is probably caused when pieces that have broken off otoliths have slipped into one of the semicircular canals. In most cases, it is the posterior canal that is affected. In certain head positions, these particles shift and create a fluid wave which displaces the cupula of the canal affected, which leads to dizziness, vertigo and nystagmus. A similar condition to BPPV may occur in dogs and other mammals, but the term vertigo cannot be applied because it refers to subjective perception. Terminology is not standardized for this condition. A common vestibular pathology of dogs and cats is colloquially known as \\"old dog vestibular disease\\", or more formally idiopathic peripheral vestibular disease, which causes sudden episode of loss of balance, circling, head tilt, and other signs. This condition is very rare in young dogs but fairly common in geriatric animals, and may affect cats of any age. Vestibular dysfunction has also been found to correlate with cognitive and emotional disorders, including depersonalization and derealization.  Other vertebrates  Though humans as well as most other vertebrates exhibit three semicircular canals in their vestibular systems, Lampreys and Hagfish are vertebrates that deviate from this trend. The vestibular systems of lampreys contain two semicircular canals while those of hagfish contain a single canal. The lamprey's two canals are developmentally similar to the anterior and posterior canals found in humans. The single canal found in hagfish appears to be secondarily derived. Additionally, the vestibular systems of lampreys and hagfish differ from those found in other vertebrates in that the otolithic organs of lampreys and hagfish are not segmented like the utricle and saccula found in humans, but rather form one continuous structure referred to as the macula communis.  Other Vestibular systems  Birds possess a second vestibular organ in the back, the lumbosacral canals. Behavioral evidence suggests that this system is responsible for stabilizing the body during walking and standing. The presence of this second system explains how many birds are capable of sleeping on one leg while putting their head under a wing.

His main work concerned the evolution of signals, particularly those signals that are indicative of fitness, and their selection for \\"honesty\\". Biography Amotz Zahavi was influenced to study zoology by the director of the zoo at Tel Aviv, Heinrich Mendelssohn. He received his Ph.D from Tel Aviv University in 1970. He was married to Avishag Zahavi, a biologist and a co- investigator. He died in Tel Aviv, Israel on May 12, 2017, aged 88. Scientific career Zahavi with wild Arabian babblers, whose social behavior he studied Zahavi is best known for his work on the handicap principle, which explains the evolution of characteristics, behaviors or structures that appear contrary to the principles of Darwinian evolution in that they appear to reduce fitness and endanger individual organisms. Evolved by sexual selection, these act as signals of the status of the organism, functioning to e. g. attract mates. He expanded it with theories on honest signalling and the idea that selection would favour signals that impose a higher cost, those that are not easily cheated on. He worked in particular on the Arabian babbler, a long- lived and social bird with altruistic behaviour among unrelated individuals, not explainable by kin selection. Zahavi reinterpreted these behaviours according to his signal theory and its correlative, the handicap principle. The altruistic act is costly to the donor, but may improve attractiveness to potential mates, a form of competitive altruism.Zahavi, Amotz (1990). \\"Arabian Babblers: The quest for social status in a cooperative Breeder\\", pp. 105‚Äì130 in Cooperative Breeding in Birds, P. B. Stacey and W. D. Koenig (eds.), Cambridge University Press Zahavi is credited with co-developing the information centre hypothesis in 1973 with Peter Ward. The information centre hypothesis states that birds live in communal roosts primarily to gain information on food resource locations from other roost individuals. Towards the end of his life he attempted to apply his theory at the molecular scale and sought to examine for example whether the neuro-transmitter acetyl choline was selected due to its toxicity. Awards In 1980, The Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel, Zahavi and two other colleagues, was awarded the Israel Prize for SPNI's special contribution to society and the State, for the environment. In 2011, Zahavi received the Fyssen Foundation's International Prize for the evolution of social communication.

He was best known as the co- founder, guitarist, bassist, and co-songwriter of the jazz rock band Steely Dan.Russonello, Giovanni, \\"Listen to 13 Essential Walter Becker Songs.\\" New York Times, 2017-09-04. Accessed 2019-05-29. Becker met future songwriting partner Donald Fagen while they were students at Bard College. After a brief period of activity in New York City, the two moved to Los Angeles in 1971 and formed the nucleus of Steely Dan, which enjoyed a critically and commercially successful ten-year career. Following the group's dissolution, Becker moved to Hawaii and reduced his musical activity, working primarily as a record producer. In 1985, he briefly became a member of the English band China Crisis, producing and playing synthesizer on their album Flaunt the Imperfection. Becker and Fagen reformed Steely Dan in 1993 and remained active, recording Two Against Nature (2000), which won four Grammy Awards. Becker released two solo albums 11 Tracks of Whack (1994) and Circus Money (2008). Following a brief battle with esophageal cancer, he died on September 3, 2017. Early life and career (1950‚Äì1971) Becker was born in Queens, New York City. After Becker's parents separated when he was a boy, his mother, who was British, returned to England. He was raised in Queens and Scarsdale, New York by his father and grandmother. His father sold paper-cutting machinery in Manhattan. He graduated from Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan in 1967. After starting out on saxophone, he switched to guitar and received instruction in blues technique from neighbor Randy California, who later formed the band Spirit. Donald Fagen overheard Becker playing guitar at a campus caf√© when they were both students at Bard College in Annandale-on- Hudson, New York. In an interview many years later, Fagen said, \\"I hear this guy practicing, and it sounded very professional and contemporary. It sounded like, you know, like a black person, really.\\" They formed the band Leather Canary, which included fellow student Chevy Chase on drums. At the time, Chase called the group \\"a bad jazz band.\\" Becker left the school in 1969 before completing his degree and moved with Fagen to Brooklyn, where the two began to build a career as a songwriting duo. They were members of the touring band for Jay and the Americans but used pseudonyms. They also composed music for the soundtrack to You've Got to Walk It Like You Talk It or You'll Lose That Beat, a film starring Richard Pryor that was released in 1971. With Steely Dan (1971‚Äì1981) In 1971, Becker and Fagen moved to Los Angeles and formed Steely Dan with guitarists Denny Dias and Jeff \\"Skunk\\" Baxter, drummer Jim Hodder, and vocalist David Palmer. Fagen played keyboards and sang, while Becker played bass guitar. Steely Dan spent the next three years touring and recording before swearing off touring in 1974, confining themselves to the studio with personnel that changed for every album. In addition to co-writing all of the band's material, Becker played guitar and bass guitar and sang background vocals. Pretzel Logic (1974) was the first Steely Dan album to feature Becker on guitar. \\"Once I met (session musician) Chuck Rainey\\", he explained, \\"I felt there really was no need for me to be bringing my bass guitar to the studio anymore\\". Despite the success of Aja in 1977, Becker suffered from setbacks during this period, including an addiction to narcotics. After the duo returned to New York in 1978, Becker's girlfriend Karen Roberta Stanley, who was an employee of ABC Dunhill Records and personal manager for the band, died of a drug overdose in his apartment on January 30, 1980, resulting in a wrongful death lawsuit against him. Soon after, he was hit by a cab in Manhattan while crossing the street and was forced to walk with crutches while recovering. His exhaustion was exacerbated by commercial pressure and the complicated recording of the album Gaucho (1980). Becker and Fagen suspended their partnership in June 1981. Work in record production (1981‚Äì1993) Following Steely Dan's breakup, Becker and his family moved to Maui. Becker ceased using drugs, stopped smoking and drinking, and became an \\"avocado rancher and self-styled critic of the contemporary scene.\\" He produced albums for the new wave bands Fra Lippo Lippi and China Crisis, and is credited on the latter's 1985 album Flaunt the Imperfection as a member of the band. He also produced albums for Michael Franks and John Beasley. Becker produced Rickie Lee Jones's album Flying Cowboys and played bass on the main title track co-written by Pascal Nabet Meyer, which was certified Gold by the RIAA in 1997. Becker and Fagen reunited in 1986 to collaborate on Zazu, the debut album by Rosie Vela. In 1991, Becker appeared in Fagen's New York Rock and Soul Revue. Steely Dan reformation (1993‚Äì2017)  Becker and Donald Fagen at Pori Jazz, 2007 In 1993, Becker produced Fagen's album Kamakiriad. A year later, Fagen co-produced Becker's debut album 11 Tracks of Whack. Also in 1993, Steely Dan began touring for the first time in nineteen years, resulting in the 1995 release of their first live album, Alive in America, a compilation of live recordings from different American tour dates in 1993 and 1994. In a column for Guitar Player magazine published in 1994, Becker coined the acronym G.A.S. (\\"Guitar Acquisition Syndrome\\") denoting the uncontrolled accumulation of music gear.Walter Becker: \\"The Dreaded G.A.S.\\", in: Guitar Player, April 1994, p. 15. The term was later adapted as Gear Acquisition Syndrome in online forums and music magazines. In 2000 they released Two Against Nature, their first album of new material in twenty years. The album won four Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year. In 2001 they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and received honorary doctorates from the Berklee College of Music, which they accepted in person. In 2003, they released the album Everything Must Go with Becker singing lead vocal on \\"Slang of Ages\\". They followed the album with a tour. In 2005, Becker co-produced and played bass guitar on the album All One by Krishna Das and played guitar on the album Tough on Crime by Rebecca Pidgeon. He co-wrote \\"I'm All Right\\" from the album Half the Perfect World (2006) by Madeleine Peyroux and \\"You Can't Do Me\\" and the title track from her album Bare Bones (2009). He was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in 2008. His second solo album, Circus Money, was released on June 10, 2008, fourteen years after its predecessor. The songs were inspired by reggae and other styles of Jamaican music. Personal life In 1984 Becker married Elinor Roberta Meadows, a yoga teacher, and the couple had two children, including adopted daughter Sayan. They divorced in 1997. Becker wrote the song \\"Little Kawai\\" for his son, and it became the final song on the album 11 Tracks of Whack. Becker was also married to Delia Cioffi and Juanna Fatouros. Death On September 3, 2017, Becker died of esophageal cancer at his home in Manhattan, New York City. At the time of his death, no cause or other details were announced, but a statement released in November by Becker's widow, Delia Becker, detailed his struggle with the disease. Musicians such as Julian Lennon, Steve Lukather, and John Darnielle of the Mountain Goats made public statements mourning Becker's death. Rickie Lee Jones, whose album Flying Cowboys was produced by Becker, recalled her long friendship with him in an editorial she wrote for Rolling Stone. In a statement released to the media the day of Becker's death, Fagen recalled his long-time friend and musical partner as \\"smart as a whip, an excellent guitarist and a great songwriter,\\" and closed by stating that he intended to \\"keep the music we created together alive as long as I can with the Steely Dan band.\\" Solo discography =As leader= * 11 Tracks of Whack (1994) * Circus Money (2008) =As sideman or producer= * 1969 Alias Boona, Terence Boylan * 1974 First Grade, Thomas Jefferson Kaye * 1985 Flaunt the Imperfection, China Crisis * 1986 Zazu, Rosie Vela * 1987 Light and Shade, Fra Lippo Lippi * 1989 Diary of a Hollow Horse, China Crisis * 1989 Flying Cowboys, Rickie Lee Jones * 1993 Kamakiriad, Donald Fagen * 1994 Mose the Fireman, John Beasley * 2005 All One, Krishna Das * 2005 Tough on Crime, Rebecca Pidgeon * 2011 Fra Lippo Lippi, Fra Lippo Lippi References External links * * Companion media website - www.walterbeckermedia.com * * Category:1950 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Stuyvesant High School alumni Category:Bard College alumni Category:Record producers from New York (state) Category:American rock guitarists Category:American male guitarists Category:American rock bass guitarists Category:American male bass guitarists Category:American male songwriters Category:American people of British descent Category:Grammy Award winners Category:People from Forest Hills, Queens Category:Deaths from esophageal cancer Category:Deaths from cancer in New York (state) Category:Jazz-rock guitarists Category:20th-century American guitarists Category:21st-century American guitarists Category:20th-century American male musicians Category:21st-century American male musicians ","title":"Walter Becker"},{"id":"550558","text":"Christ Washing the Feet of the Apostles by Meister des Hausbuches, 1475 (Gem√§ldegalerie, Berlin) The Paschal Triduum (Latin: Triduum Paschale),For the etymology of the term Paschal see Names of Easter. Holy Triduum (Latin: Triduum Sacrum), or Easter Triduum, or the Three Days, is the period of three days that begins with the liturgy on the evening of Maundy Thursday,Catholic Liturgy, Holy Thursday Evening Mass of the Lord's Supper reaches its high point in the Easter Vigil, and closes with evening prayer on Easter Sunday. It recalls the Passion, Crucifixion, Death, burial, and Resurrection of Jesus, as portrayed in the canonical Gospels.{{Cite weburl=http://bibleresources.americanbible.org/bible-resources/bible In the Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist, Moravian and Reformed traditions, the Paschal Triduum straddles the two liturgical seasons of Lent and Easter in the Church calendar (Holy Saturday is the last day of Lent, with the Easter Vigil being the first liturgy of Eastertide); however, in the Roman Catholic tradition, since the 1955 reform by Pope Pius XII, the Easter Triduum has been more clearly distinguished as a separate liturgical period. Previously, all these celebrations were advanced by more than twelve hours. The Mass of the Lord's Supper and the Easter Vigil were celebrated in the morning of Thursday and Saturday respectively, and Holy Week and Lent were seen as ending only on the approach of Easter. After the Gloria in excelsis Deo at the Mass of the Lord's Supper, all church bells are silenced and the organ is not used. The period that lasted from Thursday morning to before Easter Sunday began was once, in Anglo-Saxon times, referred to as \\"the still days\\". In the Catholic Church, weddings, which were once prohibited throughout the entire season of Lent and during certain other periods as well, are prohibited during the Triduum. Lutherans still discourage weddings during the entirety of Holy Week and the Easter Triduum. Maundy Thursday (also called Holy Thursday) altar of this Methodist church was stripped and the crucifix of this Methodist church was veiled in black for Good Friday (black is the liturgical colour for Good Friday in the United Methodist Church). A wooden cross sits in front of the bare chancel for the veneration of the cross ceremony, which occurs during the United Methodist Good Friday liturgy. In some Protestant denominations, the Triduum begins with an evening worship service on Maundy Thursday. In the Catholic Church and in the Anglo-Catholic tradition of Anglicanism, in the Mass of the Lord's Supper, during the Gloria in Excelsis Deo, all church bells may be rung and the organ played; afterwards, bells and organ are silenced until the Gloria of the Easter Vigil.Catholic Liturgy, Holy Thursday Evening Mass of the Lord's Supper After the homily or sermon of the Mass, \\"where a pastoral reason suggests it\\", a ritual washing of the feet follows.Roman Missal, \\"Thursday of the Lord's Supper\\", 10 The Mass concludes with a procession of the Blessed Sacrament to the altar of repose. In the Anglican tradition, this is usually followed by the stripping of the altars. Eucharistic adoration is encouraged after this, but if continued after midnight should be done without outward solemnity. In the form of the Roman Rite in use before 1955, Mass was celebrated in the morning. Some faithful travelled to several churches to pray at each one's Altar of Repose, a practice called Seven Churches Visitation, which now is associated rather with the morning of Good Friday. The Mass included no washing of the feet, which could instead be done in a separate ceremony later in the day. The Mass itself concluded with a ritual stripping of all altars except the altar of repose, leaving only the cross and candlesticks. In the present form as revised in 1955, the altar is stripped bare without ceremony at some time after the evening Mass. The liturgical colour for the Mass vestments and other ornaments is white in the Catholic and Anglican Churches.General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 346 In the Lutheran Church, the liturgical colour for Maundy Thursday is white. In the Reformed tradition, white or gold may be used. Good Friday Ecce Homo by Antonio Ciseri (19th century). On Good Friday, Christians recall the passion and crucifixion of Jesus. In the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Anglo-Catholic rites, a cross or crucifix (not necessarily the one that stands on or near the altar on other days of the year) is ceremonially unveiled. (In pre-1955 services, other crucifixes were to be unveiled, without ceremony, after the Good Friday service.) In the Catholic ritual, clergy traditionally begin the service prostrate in front of the altar. Mass is not celebrated on Good Friday and the communion distributed at the Celebration of the Lord's Passion is consecrated on Holy Thursday, hence the pre-1955 name \\"Mass of the Presanctified\\". In Anglican churches, there is no prayer of consecration on Good Friday, and the Reserved Sacrament is distributed at services on that day. Also in Catholicism, images of saints may, in accordance with local custom, be veiled throughout the last two weeks of Lent. Votive lights before these images are not lit. Crucifixes that are movable are hidden, while those that are not movable are veiled until after the Good Friday service.Covering of Crosses and Images in Lent Catholic faithful typically venerate the crucifix by kissing the feet of the corpus. Veneration of a simple wooden cross is common in Anglican worship, with the faithful touching or kissing it. Colors of vestments (and hangings, if kept) vary: no color, red, or black are used in different traditions. The Catholic Church uses red vestments, symbolic of the blood of Jesus Christ, but in the pre-1970 form of the Roman Missal the priest wears black, changing to violet for the communion part of the service. In Anglican services, black vestments are sometimes used. In the United Methodist Church, black is the liturgical colour used on Good Friday. In the Lutheran churches, there is no liturgical color on Good Friday. Altars remain stripped and clergy wear no vestments on this day. Moravians hold a Lovefeast on Good Friday as they receive Holy Communion on Maundy Thursday. Communicants of the Moravian Church practice the Good Friday tradition of cleaning gravestones in Moravian cemeteries. Holy Saturday Jesus Resurrected by Piero della Francesca (15th century). Also called Black Saturday, is a vigil service that is held after nightfall on Holy Saturday, or before dawn on Easter Sunday, in commemoration Jesus' death and harrowing of Hell. Many of the details that follow hold for Anglican and Evangelical Lutheran churches as well as Catholic worship. The ceremony of darkness and light is held at the beginning of the Easter Vigil Mass. The paschal candle, whose lighting symbolizes the resurrection of Christ from the dead,How do we use a paschal candle is lit from the new Easter fire. The solemn procession to the altar with the Paschal candle is formed. Once everyone has processed in, the Exsultet is intoned. After the Exsultet, everyone is seated and listens to seven readings from the Old Testament and seven Psalms. At least three of these readings and associated psalms must be read, which must include the account of the first Passover from the Book of Exodus. Pastoral conditions are taken into account when deciding on the number of readings.Catholic Culture accessed 12 August 2010United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. Accessed 12 August 2010Catholic Liturgy, Easter Sunday of the Lord's Resurrection, The Easter Vigil. Accessed 12 August 2010 These readings account salvation history, beginning with Creation. In Anglican worship, there are nine possible readings from the Old Testament, and a minimum of two must be read, which must include the account of Israel's deliverance at the Red Sea. In Catholic practice, during the Gloria at the Mass, the organ and church bells are used in the liturgy for the first time in two days.Catholic City Tenbrae Retrieved on April 5, 2007 If the lights of the Church have been previously left off, they are turned on as the Gloria begins. The Paschal candle is used to bless the baptismal font to be used in the celebration of the sacrament. The Great Alleluia is sung before the Gospel is read, Alleluia being used for the first time since before Lent. People receiving full initiation in the Church, who have completed their training, are given the Sacraments of Christian initiation (Baptism, confirmation, and the Holy Eucharist). In Catholic and Anglican tradition, the Easter Vigil is an especially appropriate day for Holy Baptism. In current practice, the use of lighting to signify the emergence from sin and the resurrection of Jesus varies, from the use of candles held by parishioners as well as candelabra lit throughout the church. If statues and images have been veiled during the last two weeks of Lent, they are unveiled, without ceremony, before the Easter Vigil service begins. (In the 1962 Catholic missal and earlier missals, they are unveiled during the \\"Gloria in Excelsis\\" of the Easter Vigil Mass.) Color of vestments and hangings: white, often together with gold, with yellow and white flowers often in use in many parishes. Easter Masses are held throughout the day and are similar in content to the Easter Vigil Mass. Easter time The date of Easter varies from year to year. It occurs on the first Sunday after the first full moon on or after 21 March, a date taken, in accordance with an ancient ecclesiastical tradition, to be that of the spring equinox, but which does not always correspond to the astronomical equinox. The Julian Calendar is taken as the basis of the calculations by nearly all Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Orthodox Churches and is accepted even by Latin Church Catholics in countries such as Ethiopia and Greece. In the 20th and 21st centuries, the Julian Calendar's 21 March corresponds to 3 April in the Gregorian Calendar, the calendar used for civil purposes in most countries. The earliest possible date for Easter is 22 March, and the latest 25 April. These dates in the Julian Calendar now correspond to the Gregorian Calendar's 4 April and 8 May. During the Easter octave (and also during Holy Week) no other feast is celebrated. If Easter is very early, the solemnity of the Annunciation (25 March) may fall within the octave or Holy Week and is then transferred to the Monday after the octave.Universal Norms on the Calendar, 60. This is an exception to the normal rule that impeded solemnities are transferred to the closest day not ranked as feast or higher. The Sundays of Advent, Lent, and Easter have precedence over all feasts and solemnities, solemnities being then transferred to the following Monday, unless they occur on Palm Sunday or on Sunday of the Lord's Resurrection.Universal Norms on the Calendar, 5 \\"The Solemnity of Saint Joseph, where it is observed as a Holyday of Obligation, should it fall on Palm Sunday of the Lord's Passion, is anticipated on the preceding Saturday, 18 March. Where, on the other hand, it is not observed as a Holyday of Obligation, it may be transferred by the Conference of Bishops to another day outside Lent.\\"Universal Norms on the Calendar, 56 The solemnity of the Ascension is on the fortieth day of Easter, which is always a Thursday, although it may be observed on the following Sunday. Pentecost (or Whitsun) is the fiftieth day. The Easter season extends from the Easter Vigil through Pentecost Sunday on the Roman Catholic, Anglo- Catholic and Protestant calendars. In the pre-1970 Roman Catholic calendar the octave of Pentecost is included in Eastertide, which thus ends at None of the following Ember Saturday. During the 50-day Easter period, vestments are generally white or gold, but red when celebrating apostles and martyrs and on the solemnity of Pentecost. In the pre-1970 Roman Catholic calendar, with its 56-day Eastertide, red was used during the octave of Pentecost.

She was the lead ship of her class of destroyers in the United States Navy. History Farragut was laid down by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation's Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts, on 20 September 1932, launched on 15 March 1934 by Mrs. James Roosevelt, daughter- in-law of the President, and commissioned on 18 June 1934, with Commander Elliott Buckmaster in command. Farragut underway in September 1939. Because it was nearly 14 years since a new destroyer had been commissioned in the U.S. Navy, Farragut devoted much of her early service to developmental operations, cruising out of her homeport of Norfolk, Virginia, to the Caribbean and along the east coast. On 26 March 1935, she embarked with President Franklin D. Roosevelt at Jacksonville, Florida, and the next day carried him to a rendezvous with a private yacht. Farragut escorted the President's yacht on a cruise to the Bahamas; on 7 April he embarked on her for passage to Jacksonville, where he left the ship on 8 April 1935. Farragut sailed for San Diego, California, arriving there on 19 April 1935 to join Destroyer Squadron 20 as flagship. Fleet maneuvers on the west coast, training operations in the Hawaiian Islands, and cruises during the summer to train men of the Naval Reserve in Alaskan waters continued until 3 January 1939. Farragut then sailed for fleet maneuvers in the Caribbean, returning to San Diego on 12 April. From 2 October she was based at Pearl Harbor, and made two voyages to the west coast to screen carriers to Pearl Harbor. From 1 August 1941, Farragut was pretty much at sea for exercises with carrier task forces. World War II Farragut was berthed in a nest of destroyers in East Loch, Pearl Harbor, at the time of the Japanese attack on 7 December 1941. Ensign James Armen Benham, her engineering officer and senior on board at the time, got her underway, and as she sailed down the channel, she kept up a steady fire. For his action, Ensign Benham was awarded the Bronze Star.Princeton Alumni Weekly - Memorials Through March 1942, Farragut operated in Hawaiian waters, and from Oahu to San Francisco, California, on antisubmarine patrols and escort duty. On 15 April 1942, Farragut sortied from Pearl Harbor with the Lexington (CV-2) task force, bound for the Coral Sea and a rendezvous with the Yorktown (CV-5) task force. Together these forces engaged Japanese forces in the Battle of the Coral Sea from 4 to 8 May 1942. For the first 2 days of the battle, Farragut sailed with the Attack Force, while the aircraft carriers in another group launched air strikes on Tulagi. On 6 May, all ships were united as TF 17, and sailed to the northwestward to make contact with the Japanese Port Moresby Invasion Group. Next day, Farragut was detached in the Support Group assigned to continue the search for the Japanese invasion forces. Farragut's group came under heavy air attack that afternoon, but downed at least five aircraft, and received no damage to any ship. Farragut arrived at Cid Harbor, Australia, 11 May 1942, and until returning to Pearl Harbor 29 June, called at Brisbane, Noum√©a, Suva, Tongatapu, and Auckland while on escort duty. She next sortied from Pearl Harbor 7 July 1942, in the Saratoga (CV-3) task force, bound for action in the Solomon Islands. She served as screening ship and plane guard during the air operations covering the assault on Guadalcanal 7 August, and then patrolled the eastern Solomons to protect sea lanes to Guadalcanal. On 24 and 25 August, the carrier she guarded engaged Japanese forces in the air Battle of the Eastern Solomons. Farragut in December 1943. The destroyer remained in the southwest Pacific, patrolling off Guadalcanal to guard unloading transports, and escorting convoys from Australia to Espiritu Santo, Noum√©a, and the Fiji Islands. She returned to Pearl Harbor 27 January 1943, and after a west coast overhaul and training, arrived at Adak 16 April. She patrolled Alaskan waters until 11 May, when she screened transports landing troops on Adak from submarine attack. Next day she made several depth charge attacks on an enemy submarine and she continued antisubmarine patrol off the Aleutian Islands through June. Farragut patrolled and blockaded off Kiska from 5 July, joining in the bombardment of the island many times in the days before the landings of 15 August. She continued to protect the troops ashore at Kiska until 4 September, when she left Adak in convoy for San Francisco and a brief overhaul. Farragut put to sea, from San Diego 19 October 1943, bound for training in the Hawaiian Islands and at Espiritu Santo. Again guarding carriers, she took part in the air operations covering the landings on Tarawa 20 November, and screened the carriers until the task force shaped course for Pearl Harbor 8 December. The destroyer continued on to the west coast for a brief repair period and training, sailing from San Diego 13 January 1944 for action in the Marshall Islands. During the assaults on Kwajalein and Eniwetok, she screened carriers, patrolled, and conducted antisubmarine searches, then sailed for air strikes on Woleai and Wakde. Late in April, she was off New Guinea as the carriers supported the landings in the Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura) area, and through May joined in training operations out of Majuro. From her arrival off Saipan 11 June 1944, Farragut guarded the carriers covering the landings of 15 June, bombarded the shores of Saipan and Guam, and served as radar picket through the Battle of the Philippine Sea on 19 and 20 June. Farragut sailed to replenish at Eniwetok 28 June to 14 July. On 17 and 18 July, she closed the beach at Agat, Guam, to provide covering fire for underwater demolition teams preparing for the assault on the island. After screening a cruiser to Saipan she returned to Guam 21 July to patrol seaward of the Fire Support Group covering the assault landings. On 25 July, she joined in the bombardment of Rota, and 5 days later cleared for overhaul at Puget Sound Navy Yard. Farragut in dazzle pattern camouflage, September 1944. Farragut arrived at Ulithi 21 November 1944, and sailed 4 days later to screen a group of oilers serving the fast carrier task force as it sent strikes against Taiwan and Luzon in preparation for the assault on Lingayen. Based on Ulithi, she served with this group as it supported the carriers in their operations of the Iwo Jima and Okinawa invasions, then from 25 to 28 April 1945 served on carrier screening duty for air operations on islands of the Ryukyus not yet invaded. From 11 May to 6 August, she escorted convoys between Ulithi and Okinawa, and during the last 2 weeks of May, served on radar picket duty at Okinawa.

He spent much of the period from 1937 to 1951 imprisoned in forced-labor camps in the arctic region of Kolyma, due in part to his having supported Leon Trotsky and praised the anti-Soviet writer Ivan Bunin. In 1946, near death, he became a medical assistant while still a prisoner. He remained in that role for the duration of his sentence, then for another two years after being released, until 1953. From 1954 to 1978, he wrote a set of short stories about his experiences in the labor camps, which were collected and published in six volumes, collectively known as Kolyma Tales. These books were initially published in the West, in English translation, starting in the 1960s; they were eventually published in the original Russian, but only became officially available in the Soviet Union in 1987, in the post-glasnost era. The Kolyma Tales are considered Shalamov's masterpiece, and \\"the definitive chronicle\\" of life in the labor camps.  Early life  Shalamov's house Varlam Shalamov was born in Vologda, Vologda Governorate, a Russian city with a rich culture famous for its wooden architecture, to the family of a hereditary Russian Orthodox priest and teacher, Father Tikhon Nikolayevich Shalamov, a graduate of the . At first young Shalamov was named and baptized after the patron of Vologda, Saint Varlaam Khutinskiy (1157‚Äì1210); Shalamov later changed his name to the more common Varlam. Shalamov's mother, Nadezhda (Nadia) Aleksandrovna, was a teacher as well. She also enjoyed poetry, and Varlam speculated that she could have become a poet if not for her family. His father worked as a missionary in Alaska for 12 years from 1892, and Varlam's older brother, Sergei, grew up there (he volunteered for World War I and was killed in action in 1917); they returned as events were heating up in Russia by 1905. In 1914, Varlam entered the gymnasium of St. Alexander's and graduated in 1923. Although he was a son of a priest, he used to say that he lost faith and became an atheist at the age of 13. His father was of very progressive views and even supported the October Revolution in a way. Upon his graduation it became clear that the Regional Department of People's Education (RONO, Regionalnoe Otdelenie Narodnogo Obrazovania) would not support his further education because Varlam was a son of a priest. Therefore, he found a job as a tanner at the leather factory in the settlement of Kuntsevo (a suburb of Moscow, since 1960 part of the Moscow city). In 1926, after having worked for two years, he was accepted into the department of Soviet Law at Moscow State University through open competition. While studying there Varlam was intrigued by the oratory skills displayed during the debates between Anatoly Lunacharsky and Metropolitan Alexander Vvedensky. At that time Shalamov was convinced that he would become a literature specialist. His literary tastes included Modernist literature (later, he would say that he considered his teachers not Tolstoy, of whom he was very critical, or other classic writers, but Andrei Bely and Aleksey Remizov) and classic poetry. His favorite poets were Alexander Pushkin and Boris Pasternak, whose works influenced him his entire life. He also praised Dostoevsky, Savinkov, Joyce and Hemingway, about whom he later wrote a long essay depicting the myriad possibilities of artistic endeavors. First imprisonment, 1929‚Äì1932 USSR PD photo of V. Shalamov, 1929 Shalamov joined a Trotskyist-leaning group and on February 19, 1929, was arrested and sent to Butyrskaya prison for solitary confinement. He was later sentenced to three years of correctional labor in the town of Vizhaikha, convicted of distributing the \\"Letters to the Party Congress\\" known as Lenin's Testament, which were critical of Joseph Stalin, and of participating in a demonstration marking the tenth anniversary of the Soviet revolution with the slogan \\"Down with Stalin\\". Courageously he refused to sign the sentence branding him a criminal. Later, he would write in his short stories that he was proud of having continued the Russian revolutionary tradition of members of the Socialist Revolutionary Party and Narodnaya Volya, who were fighting against tsarism. He was taken by train to the former Solikamsk monastery, which was transformed into a militsiya headquarters of the Vishera department of Solovki ITL\\"ITL\\" stands for Ispravitelno-Trudovoi Lager which means Correctional Labor Camp OGPU (VishLAG). Shalamov was released in 1931 and worked in the new town of Berezniki, Perm Oblast at the local chemical plant construction site. He was given the opportunity to travel to Kolyma for colonization. Sarcastically, Shalamov said that he would go there only under enforced escort. Coincidentally, fate would hold him to his promise several years later. He returned to Moscow in 1932, where he worked as a journalist and managed to see some of his essays and articles published, including his first short story, \\"The three deaths of Doctor Austino\\" (1936). Second imprisonment, 1937‚Äì1942 NKVD photo of V. Shalamov, 1937 At the outset of the Great Purge, on January 12, 1937, Shalamov was arrested again for \\"counter- revolutionary Trotskyist activities\\" and sent to Kolyma, also known as \\"the land of white death\\", for five years. He was already in jail awaiting sentencing when one of his short stories was published in the literary journal Literary Contemporary. Third imprisonment, 1943‚Äì1951 In 1943 Shalamov was sentenced to another term, this time for 10 years, under Article 58 (anti- Soviet agitation), for having called anti-Soviet writer Ivan Bunin a \\"classic Russian writer\\". The conditions he endured were extreme, first in gold mining operations, and then in coal mining. He was repeatedly sent to punishment zones, both for his political \\"crimes\\" and for his attempt to escape. There he managed to survive while sick with typhus of which Shalamov was not aware until he became well. At that time, as he recollects in his writings, he did not care much about his survival. In 1946, while becoming a dokhodyaga (one in an emaciated and devitalized state, which in Russian literally means one who is walking towards the ultimate end), his life was saved by a doctor-inmate A. I. Pantyukhov, who risked his own life to get Shalamov a place as a camp hospital attendant. The new \\"career\\" allowed Shalamov to survive and concentrate on writing poetry. After release In 1951, Shalamov was released from the camp, and continued working as a medical assistant for the forced labor camps of Sevvostlag while still writing. After his release, he was faced with the dissolution of his former family, including a grown-up daughter who now refused to recognize her father. In 1952, Shalamov sent his poetry to Boris Pasternak, who praised his work. Shalamov was allowed to leave Magadan in November 1953 following Stalin's death in March of that year, and was permitted to go to the village of Turkmen in Kalinin Oblast, near Moscow, where he worked as a supply agent. Kolyma Tales From 1954 to 1973, Shalamov worked on his book of short stories of labour camp life, Kolyma Tales. During the Khrushchev thaw, enormous numbers of inmates were released from the Gulag and politically rehabilitated. Many were also rehabilitated posthumously. Shalamov was allowed to return to Moscow after having been officially exonerated (\\"rehabilitated\\") in 1956. In 1957, he became a correspondent for the literary journal Moskva, and his poetry began to be published. His health, however, had been broken by his years in the camps, and he received a disability pension. Shalamov proceeded to publish poetry and essays in the major Soviet literary magazines while writing his magnum opus, Kolyma Tales. He was acquainted with Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Boris Pasternak, and Nadezhda Mandelstam. The manuscripts of Kolyma Tales were smuggled abroad and distributed via samizdat. The translations were published in the West in 1966. The complete Russian-language edition was published in London in 1978, and reprinted thereafter both in Russian and in translation. As the Soviet scholar David Satter writes, \\"Shalamov's short stories are the definitive chronicle of those camps\\".Satter, \\"David Satter on life in the Soviet police state\\", The Wall Street Journal, May 3, 2013. Kolyma Tales is considered to be one of the great Russian collections of short stories of the twentieth century.Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek. \\"The Dreams of Others\\". In These Times.

SolzhenitsynRecollection works of Shalamov Shalamov also wrote a series of autobiographical essays that vividly bring to life Vologda and his life before prison. Last years As his health deteriorated, he spent the last three years of his life in a house for elderly and disabled writers operated by Litfond (Union of Soviet Writers) in Tushino. The quality of this nursing home can be judged from the memoirs of Yelena Zakharova, who was introduced to Shalamov by her father, who had translated some of his works, and was close to Shalamov in the last six months of his life: Despite his impairments, he continued to compose poems, which were written down and published by . Following a cursory examination, it was determined that he should be transferred to a psychiatric facility. On the way there, he became ill and contracted pneumonia. Shalamov died on January 17, 1982, and, despite having been an atheist, was given an Orthodox funeral ceremony (at the insistence of his friend, Zakharova) and was interred at Kuntsevo Cemetery, Moscow. The historian Valery Yesipov wrote that only forty people attended Shalamov's funeral, not counting plainclothes policemen. Kolyma Tales was finally published on Russian soil in 1987, as a result of Mikhail Gorbachev's glasnost policy. Legacy In 1991, the Shalamov family house in Vologda, next to the town's cathedral, was turned into the Shalamov Memorial Museum and local art gallery. The cathedral hill in Vologda has been named in his memory.

Shalamov's friend, Fedot Fedotovich Suchkov, erected a monument on the burial plot, which was destroyed by unknown vandals in 2001. The criminal case was closed as uncompleted. With the help of some workers from SeverStal the monument was reestablished in 2001.

As a novelist, Banks is best known for his \\"detailed accounts of domestic strife and the daily struggles of ordinary often-marginalized characters\\". His stories usually revolve around his own childhood experiences, and often reflect \\"moral themes and personal relationships\\". Banks is a member of the International Parliament of Writers and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.  Life and career  Banks was born in Newton, Massachusetts on March 28, 1940 and grew up \\"in relative poverty.\\" He is the son of Florence (Taylor), a homemaker, and Earl Banks, a plumber, and was raised in Barnstead, New Hampshire.https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/1104/the-art-of-fiction- no-152-russell-banks His father deserted the family when Banks was aged 12. While he was awarded a scholarship to attend Colgate University, he dropped out six weeks into university and travelled south instead, with the \\"intention of joining Fidel Castro's insurgent army in Cuba, but wound up working in a department store in Lakeland, Florida\\". He married a sales clerk and they had a daughter. According to an interview with The Independent, he started to write when he was living in Miami in the late-1950s, though an interview with The Paris Review dates this to Banks's subsequent spell living in Boston. He moved back to New England in 1964 and then to North Carolina, where he attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, funded by the family of his second wife, Mary Gunst. In Chapel Hill, Banks was involved in Students for a Democratic Society and protest during the Civil Rights Movement. In 1976, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship. Banks divorced Mary Gunst in 1977 after 14 years of marriage. He was subsequently married to Kathy Walton, an editor at Harper & Row, for five years. Banks now lives in Keene, upstate New York, wintering in Miami. He was a New York State Author for 2004‚Äì2006. He is also Artist-in-Residence at the University of Maryland. He has taught creative writing at Princeton University. He is married to the poet Chase Twichell, his fourth wife. Banks has four daughters from his previous marriages. Banks was the 1985 recipient of the John Dos Passos Prize for fiction. Continental Drift and Cloudsplitter were finalists for the 1986 and 1999 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction respectively. Banks was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1996. Works and themes His work has been translated into twenty languages and has received numerous international prizes and awards. He has written fiction, and more recently, non-fiction, with Dreaming up America. His main works include the novels Continental Drift, Rule of the Bone, Cloudsplitter, The Sweet Hereafter, and Affliction. The latter two novels were each made into feature films in 1997 (see The Sweet Hereafter and Affliction). Many of Banks's works reflect his working-class upbringing. His stories often show people facing tragedy and downturns in everyday life, expressing sadness and self-doubt, but also showing resilience and strength in the face of their difficulties. Banks has also written short stories, some of which appear in the collection The Angel on the Roof, as well as poetry. Banks has also lived in Jamaica. Interviewed in 1998 for The Paris Review, he stated that: The themes of Continental Drift (1985) include globalization and unrest in Haiti. His 2004 novel The Darling is largely set in Liberia and deals with the racial and political experience of the white American narrator. Writing in the Journal of American Studies, Anthony Hutchison argues that, \\"[a]side from William Faulkner it is difficult to think of a white twentieth-century American writer who has negotiated the issue of race in as sustained, unflinching and intelligent a fashion as Russell Banks\\". Critics According to Robert Faggen in The Paris Review, Banks's debut novel, Family Life, \\"was not a critical success\\". His next volume, a collection of short stories called Searching for Survivors, won Banks an O. Henry Award. A second collection of short stories, The New World, published in 1978, \\"received acclaim for its blending of historical and semi- autobiographical material\\". Many have admired Russell Banks' realistic writing, which often explores American social dilemmas and moral struggles. Reviewers have appreciated his portrayal of the working-class people struggling to overcome destructive relationships, poverty, drug abuse, and spiritual confusion. Scholars have variously compared Banks's fiction to the works of Raymond Carver, Richard Ford, and Andre Dubus. Christine Benvenuto has commented that \\"Banks writes with an intensely focused empathy and a compassionate sense of humor that help to keep readers, if not his characters, afloat through the misadventures and outright tragedies of his books.\\" In 2011, The Guardian's Tom Cox selected Cloudsplitter as one of his \\"overlooked classics of American literature\\".

In: The Guardian. 29 June 2014.) was a British sociologist.  Early life  Lockwood was born in Holmfirth, England and was the youngest child in his working-class family. His father, Herbert, was a dyer and then retrained as a cobbler after being wounded during World War I and he died when Lockwood was 10. His mother, Edith, was a cleaner. He served in the Army Intelligence Corps from 1947-49.  Life and works  His book, The Blackcoated Worker, (1958 & 1989) seeks to analyse the changes in the stratification position of the clerical worker by using a framework based on Max Weber's distinction between market and work situations. Lockwood argued that the class position of any occupation can be most successfully located by distinguishing between the material rewards gained from the market and work situations, and those symbolic rewards deriving from its status situation. His work became a very important contribution to the 'proletarianisation' debate which argued that many white-collar workers were beginning to identify with manual workers by identifying their work situation as having much in common with the proletariat. Other published work included The Affluent Worker in the Class Structure (1969) and Solidarity and Schism (1992).

The name means \\"Dharma protector or defender\\" in Sanskrit, and the dharmapƒÅlas are also known as the Defenders of the Law (Dharma), or the Protectors of the Law. There are two kinds of dharmapala, Worldly Protectors and Wisdom Protectors. Only Wisdom Protectors are enlightened beings. https://www.himalayanart.org/search/set.cfm?setID=2404 Buddhist Protectors, Wisdom Deities: Dharmapalas at Himalayan Art Resource  Description  A protector of Buddhist dharma is called a dharmapala. They are typically wrathful deities, depicted with terrifying iconography in the Mahayana and tantric traditions of Buddhism. The wrathfulness is intended to depict their willingness to defend and guard Buddhist followers from dangers and enemies. The A·π£·π≠agatya·∏• (the eight kinds of nonhuman beings) is one category of dharmapƒÅlas, which includes the Garuda, Deva, Naga, Yaksha, Gandharva, Asura, Kinnara and Mahoraga. In Vajrayana iconography and thangka depictions, dharmapala are fearsome beings, often with many heads, many hands, or many feet. Dharmapala often have blue, black or red skin, and a fierce expression with protruding fangs. Although dharmapala have a terrifying appearance, they only act in a wrathful way for the benefit of sentient beings. The devotional worship of dharmapƒÅlas in the Tibetan tradition is traceable to early 8th-century. =Tibetan Buddhism= Citipati mask depicting MahƒÅkƒÅla There are many different dharmapalas in Tibetan Buddhism. Each school has its own principle dharmapalas and most monasteries have a dedicated dharmapƒÅla which was originally comparable to a genius loci. The many forms of Mahakala are emanations of Avalokiteshvara. Kalarupa and Yamantaka are considered by practitioners to be emanations of Manjushri the Bodhisattva of Wisdom. Principal wisdom protector dharmapalas include: * Prana Atma (Tib. Begtse) * Ekaja·π≠ƒ´ (Tib. ral chig ma) * Mahakala (Tib. Nagpo Chenpo) * Shri Devi (Tib. Palden Lhamo) * Yama (Tib.

Bishop's will established a trust called the \\"Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estate\\" that is Hawaii's largest private landowner. Originally established in 1887 as an all-boys school for native Hawaiian children, it shared its grounds with the Bishop Museum. After it moved to another location, the museum took over two school halls. Kamehameha Schools opened its girls' school in 1894. It became coeducational in 1965. The KapƒÅlama campus opened in 1931, while the Maui and Hawaii campuses opened in 1996 and 2001, respectively. It was developed at the bequest of Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop to educate children of Hawaiian descent, and is designed to serve students from preschool through twelfth grade. The school teaches in the English language a college-prep education enhanced by Hawaiian culture, language and practices, imparting historical and practical value of continuing Hawaiian traditions. It operates 31 preschools statewide and three grade K‚Äì12 campuses in KapƒÅlama, Oahu, Pukalani, Maui, and Keaau, Hawaii. By the terms of its founding, the schools' admissions policy prefers applicants with Native Hawaiian ancestry. Since 1965 it has excluded all but two non-Hawaiians from being admitted. A lawsuit challenging the school's admission policy resulted in a narrow victory for Kamehameha in the Ninth Circuit Court; however, Kamehameha ultimately settled, paying the plaintiff $7 million. As of the 2011‚Äì12 school year, Kamehameha had an enrollment of 5,398 students at its three main campuses and 1,317 children at its preschools, for a total enrollment of 5,416. Beyond its campuses, Kamehameha served an estimated 46,923 Hawaiians in 2011 through its support for public schools, charter schools, and families and caregivers throughout Hawaii. According to the Kamehameha Schools home website, the mission statement is as follows: \\"Kamehameha Schools' mission is to fulfill Pauahi's desire to create educational opportunities in perpetuity to improve the capability and well- being of people of Hawaiian ancestry.\\" History In 1883, Bernice Pauahi Bishop, a member of the Hawaiian Royal Family, directed in her will, after naming heirs for gifts of money and land, that the remainder of her estate be held in trust to create the Kamehameha Schools. A majority of the Bishop estate was inherited from her parent and her cousin Ruth Keelik≈çlani, who in turn had inherited a substantial amount from her first husband Leleiohoku I and her half-siblings Victoria KamƒÅmalu and Kamehameha V, all who were given substantial amounts of land in the Great Mahele of 1848 which had divided the land of the kingdom amongst the King, the ali'i and the common people. During her lifetime, she experienced and encountered the decline of her Hawaiian people. She was well aware that education was key to the survival of her people and culture; therefore, she left 375,000 acres of ancestral land, entrusting her trustees to use this gift to educate her people. Bernice named Samuel Mills Damon, William Owen Smith, Charles Montague Cooke, Charles McEwen Hyde, and her husband, Charles Reed Bishop, as the original five trustees to invest her estate at their discretion, use the income to operate the schools, and also \\"to devote a portion of each year's income to the support and education of orphans, and others in indigent circumstances, giving the preference to Hawaiians of pure or part aboriginal blood.\\" She also directed the Hawaii (Kingdom) Supreme Court to appoint replacement trustees and required that all teachers be Protestant, without regard to denomination. After Bishop's death in 1884, her husband Charles Reed Bishop carried out her will. Reverend William Brewster Oleson (1851‚Äì1915), former principal of the Hilo boarding school founded by David Belden Lyman in 1836, helped organize the schools on a similar model of European-American education. The original Kamehameha School for Boys opened in 1887; after it moved to a new campus, that site was later taken over by the Bishop Museum. The girls' school opened nearby in 1894. The preparatory school, originally serving grades K‚Äì6, opened in 1888 adjacent to the boys' school. By 1955, all three schools had moved to the current campus in KapƒÅlama Heights. The schools became co-ed in 1965 In 1996, the school opened a campus on Maui, followed in 2001 by the campus on Hawaii. In 1991, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) brought suit against Kamehameha Schools alleging that its requirement that all teachers be Protestant was religious discrimination in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Kamehameha Schools/Bishop Estate, 780 F.Supp. 1317 (D.Haw.1991). Although Kamehameha Schools conceded the practice was discriminatory, the School maintained that it was bound by the provisions of Bernice Pauahi Bishop's will, which established the charitable trust creating the School as well as mandating that all the teachers \\"be persons of the Protestant religion.\\"Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Kamehameha Schools/Bishop Estate, 780 F.Supp. 1317 (D.Haw.1991) Accordingly, the School sought to be included within one of the applicable exemptions to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The United States District Court for the District of Hawaii found in the School's favor, ruling that the religious education exemption, the religious curriculum exemption, and the bona fide occupational qualification exemption were each applicable to Kamehameha Schools. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the decision of the District Court, holding that none of the exemptions to the Civil Rights Act was applicable since the School was essentially a secular and not primarily a religious institution despite certain historical traditions including Protestantism.Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Kamehameha Schools/Bishop Estate 990 F.2d 458 (9th Cir.1993); As a result, the requirement that all teachers be Protestant was held to be a violation of the Civil Rights Act. =Reorganization= According to the will, the Supreme Court of Hawaii appointed trustees. After the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1893 and the annexation of the Republic of Hawaii by the United States, the Territorial and State Supreme Court assumed that responsibility. However, many trustees were political insiders. By 1997 trustees were paid $800,000 to $900,000 annually. At that time, critics alleged that the trustees were micromanaging the schools and that they had vastly over-rewarded themselves in their pay. Trustees were appointed to positions as \\"lead trustee\\" of a particular part of estate operations. In particular, Lokelani Lindsey, lead trustee for educational affairs, was blamed for low morale among students and faculty. On August 9, 1997, University of Hawaii (UH) Board of Regents Chair (and former Kamehameha Schools Principal) Gladys Brandt, retired judge Walter Heen, Msgr. Charles Kekumano, federal judge Samuel Pailthorpe King, and UH William S. Richardson School of Law professor Randall Roth published a report titled Broken Trust in the Honolulu Star Bulletin. They called on the State Attorney General to fully investigate KSBE management. The report alleged, among other things, that: * the method of selecting trustees (appointment by the Hawaii Supreme Court) was flawed * the trustees did not fully understand their responsibilities * the trustees were not accountable for their actions. On August 12, 1997, Governor Ben Cayetano directed Attorney General Margery Bronster to perform a preliminary investigation into the allegations. In her report on September 10, 1997, she found that \\"the rights of the beneficiaries may be at substantial risk,\\" and that there were \\"credible allegations that the intent of Bernice Pauahi Bishop is not being implemented.\\" Another essay appeared in November, with Brandt, UH Professor Isabella Abbott, respected Hawaiian cultural educator Winona Beamer, and others as authors. Its headline was \\"Tyranny, distrust, poor decisions reign at Kamehameha\\". The investigation continued through 1998, when Attorney General Bronster sought the permanent removal of Lindsey and fellow trustees Richard Wong and Henry Peters. On May 6, 1999, after a six-month trial, Lindsey was permanently removed as trustee (Lindsey later appealed her removal). A day later, trustees Wong, Peters, and Gerard Jervis were also temporarily removed. The fifth trustee, Oswald Stender, voluntarily resigned. An interim board was appointed by the Hawaii Probate Court to run the estate. Bronster had been re-appointed as attorney general by Governor Cayetano, who was a Democrat. Since 23 of the 25 state senators were Democrats, some political observers thought approval of Bronster's renomination would be assured. However, the investigation proved costly for Bronster, whose confirmation was defeated by the Hawaii State Senate on April 28, 1999 by a vote of 14-11. The US Internal Revenue Service retroactively revoked Bishop Estate's tax exempt status because of the trustees' breach of duties and unlawful use of tax exempt charitable trust assets for political lobbying. This action triggered charges of about $1 billion in back taxes and penalties. Jervis resigned permanently on August 20, 1999. The trials for permanent removal of the remaining three trustees were set for December 13, 1999. Wong offered his permanent resignation on December 3, 1999; Peters did the same on December 13; and Lindsey voluntarily resigned on December 17. Many of the court files relating to Bishop Estate were ordered sealed by the court, citing the need for \\"closure and healing.\\" Although new Bishop Estate trustees were appointed, they had continued to use the same attorneys and law firms as their predecessors. Deputy attorneys general advised the replacement trustees that these attorneys and law firms either had provided flawed legal advice to the previous trustees, or stood by silently while the trustees had ignored good advice. Some claimed \\"there had been no thorough housecleaning; instead, the old guard had been put in charge and handed the keys.\\" In 2002, the Hawaii Supreme Court threw out the criminal indictments against three Bishop Estate trustees on procedural grounds and ruled no new charges could be brought.State v. Wong, 97 Haw. 512, 40 P.3d 914 (Haw. 2002) In 2005, two of the authors of the newspaper series published a book exploring the issues in the full-scale investigation. The controversy was costly to the schools. In 2009, after a large decline in the endowment, trustee compensation ranged from $97,500 to $125,000 per year, and trustees turned down any pay increases. Campuses and governance Ka ªiwakƒ´loumoku Hawaiian Cultural Center: Myron \\"Pinky\\" Thompson Hale Kamehameha Schools operates three campuses, which together served 5,398 students K-12 in the 2011‚Äì12 school year. The main campus, established in 1887 as the Kamehameha Schools for Boys, occupies on KapƒÅlama Heights in Honolulu and served 3,200 students, including 550 boarding students from neighbor islands. The campus has more than 70 buildings, including numerous classroom buildings, dormitories, and maintenance shops. It also features extensive athletic facilities, including a 3,000-seat stadium, an Olympic-size swimming pool, three gymnasiums, and several tennis courts. In 2010, Kamehameha undertook a $118.5 million construction project featuring a brand-new middle school, a Hawaiian cultural center, a new athletics building, and a parking structure. The Ka ªiwakƒ´loumoku Hawaiian Cultural Center opened in October 2012, followed by the other projects in 2013. The Maui campus, established in 1996 in Pukalani, served 1,084 students. The campus on the island of Hawaii, established in 2001 in Keaau, served 1,118 students. In addition to these three campuses, Kamehameha Schools operates thirty-one preschools throughout Hawaii, which served 1,317 students statewide. The five-member Board of Trustees of the Estate of Bernice Pauahi Bishop administers the Schools. Each trustee may serve up to two five-year terms. The 1999 reorganization limited Board micromanagement. A Chief Executive Officer manages day-to-day operations and has autonomy over educational matters. Endowment A 1995 Wall Street Journal article described the Bishop Estate as \\"the nation's wealthiest charity,\\" with an endowment estimated at $10 billion ‚Äì greater than the combined endowments of Harvard and Yale universities. As of June 2011, the endowment was US$9.06 billion. Approximately 75% of the endowment is in financial assets, and 25% is in real estate. When compared against the endowments of major U.S. colleges and universities, only six schools (Harvard University, Yale University, Stanford University, Princeton University, University of Texas System, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology), each with much higher enrollments, have higher endowments than Kamehameha Schools. In 2016, the endowment was $11.1 billionhttps://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/news/2016/01/05/kamehameha-schools- endowment-reaches-11-1b-annual.html Land holdings The Royal Hawaiian Hotel is located on land owned by Kamehameha Schools. Bishop's original bequest consisted of of land worth around $474,000. More than are still controlled by the estate. The book value of the land for accounting purposes is probably much lower than fair market value. Kamehameha Schools' Land Assets Division manages nearly of this land, which is used for agricultural and conservation purposes. The remaining are designated for commercial use; approximately of those acres actively generate revenue. Kamehameha Schools' commercial real estate includes owned and operated properties and ground lease holdings. Commercial properties operating on Kamehameha Schools land include shopping centers, such as Windward Mall, Pearlridge, Kahala Mall, and Royal Hawaiian Center; and hotels, such as the Kahala Hotel & Resort, the Four Seasons Resort HualƒÅlai, and the Royal Hawaiian Hotel. Kamehameha is also redeveloping several of its urban real estate properties in Haleiwa, KƒÅhala, Kakaako, KapƒÅlama, and M≈ç ªili ªili to revitalize those areas and increase commercial revenue. On October 22, 2013, Kamehameha Schools announced that it would sell the buildings of its largest single real estate property (in terms of value), the Royal Hawaiian Center. The shopping center encompasses three blocks of prime Waikƒ´kƒ´ real estate on KalƒÅkaua Avenue. Admission Kamehameha Schools is a private organization to which students apply for admission. At the KapƒÅlama campus, the process is highly selective. Acceptance rates range from approximately 6.7% to 14.7% depending on the grade for which a student applies. Acceptance rates at the Maui and Hawaii campuses are generally higher, ranging from approximately 9.2% to 24%, due to those islands' smaller populations and the lack of boarding students at those facilities. The current enrollment is >6,900 students. In accordance with a century-old interpretation of the will of Bernice Pauahi Bishop, Kamehameha Schools gives preference to applicants of Native Hawaiian descent \\"to the extent permitted by law.\\" Orphans and indigent applicants receive special consideration as adjured in Pauahi's will. Preference applicants must submit evidence verifying that at least one of their pre-1959 ancestors is Hawaiian. The schools' admissions policy has been a subject of controversy. Because far more applicants claim Hawaiian ancestry than the schools can admit, virtually all students have some Native Hawaiian ancestry. Non-Hawaiians have attended, but this is extremely rare. In 2002, Kamehameha admitted one non-Hawaiian student, Kalani Rosell, to its Maui campus, for the first time in 40 years. Rosell was admitted after all qualified Hawaiian applicants had been admitted. This decision sparked alumni protest. Kamehameha's admissions policy was the focus of two federal lawsuits, which contended that preferring Native Hawaiians is a race-based exclusion that violates U.S. civil rights law. Both lawsuits have since been settled and the admission policy stands today. = Mohica-Cummings lawsuit = In August 2003, Brayden Gay Mohica-Cummings was a seventh-grader admitted to KapƒÅlama Heights after his mother, who is the hƒÅnai (adopted) daughter of a Hawaiian family, said he was Hawaiian. The school rescinded its admission offer when his mother was unable to document his ancestry. Because Kamehameha rescinded the offer only a week before the school year started, his family sued the school for admission. District Judge David Ezra issued a temporary restraining order requiring Kamehameha to admit Mohica-Cummings. The case was settled out- of-court in November 2003, when Kamehameha Schools agreed to let Mohica- Cummings attend, in exchange for dropping the lawsuit. =John Doe v. Kamehameha= In June 2003 a suit was filed on behalf of an unidentified non- Hawaiian student, claiming that preferring Hawaiian applicants violates provisions of the Civil Rights Act that prohibits racial discrimination in private contracts. In November, District Judge Alan Cooke Kay dismissed the lawsuit, finding that Kamehameha Schools' policy served a \\"legitimate, remedial purpose by improving native Hawaiians' socioeconomic and educational disadvantages\\". In August 2005, however, a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit of Appeals reversed 2‚Äì1, and ruled that the policy was racially exclusionary. A protest march by native Hawaiians, including Hawaii's governor and lieutenant governor, to Iolani Palace and a rally on the palace grounds attracted an estimated 10‚Äì15,000 participants. The Ninth Circuit agreed to rehear the appeal before a 15-judge en banc panel in February 2006. On December 5, 2006, by a vote of 8‚Äì7, the en banc panel reversed the earlier decision by the three-judge panel, affirming Kay's earlier ruling. The majority ruled that Kamehameha's policy does not run afoul of a civil rights law, citing what it said were unique factors in the history of Hawaii, the socioeconomic plight of Native Hawaiians, and the schools' distinctively remedial mission, which Congress has repeatedly endorsed. The dissent stated that civil rights law \\"prohibits a private school from denying admission to prospective students because of their race.\\" It was very skeptical of the majority interpretation, stating, \\"The fact that Congress has passed some measures promoting Native Hawaiian education says nothing about whether Congress intended to exempt Native Hawaiian schools from ¬ß 1981 [civil rights law]\\". Following the decision, attorneys appealed to the United States Supreme Court. However, before the Supreme Court decided whether to hear the case, Doe v. Kamehameha was also settled. Both this settlement and the Ninth Circuit's decision prompted a procession at the Kapalama High School, leading to an all- school assembly. On February 8, 2008, Goemans, attorney for John Doe, disclosed that the amount of the settlement was $7 million USD. On August 6, 2008, Kamehameha Schools announced that it had sued John Doe for releasing the settlement amount. On the same day, John Doe's attorneys, Eric Grant and David Rosen, filed another lawsuit against Kamehameha on behalf of four non-Hawaiian children who wanted to attend the school. =Sex abuse settlements= On April 24, 2020, it was revealed that Kamehameha Schools was paying $80 million in settlements. The settlements involve sex abuse claims against psychiatrist Robert Browne, who was said to have sexually abused children in the 1960s and 1970s while serving at the schools. Academics All three of Kamehameha's campuses are college-preparatory and offer honors courses. In addition, the KapƒÅlama campus offers 15 Advanced Placement courses, while the Hawaii campus offers four. The KapƒÅlama high school administered 344 Advanced Placement exams in 2014. Upper-class students at the Maui and Hawaii high schools select a \\"Career Academy\\" based on their individual interests. They develop course schedules designed to enhance skills for potential careers within their academy's scope. The campuses offer academies for arts and communication, business and leadership, engineering and design, health and wellness, and science and natural resources. Approximately 70% of Kamehameha graduates enroll in four-year universities, while 25% enroll in two-year colleges or technical schools. Students in the 2010 graduating class of the KapƒÅlama campus had an average composite SAT score of 1560 out of 2400. In the 2014 graduating class, there were 4 National Merit semi-finalists and 9 commended students. As students each have Native Hawaiian ancestry, Kamehameha emphasizes Hawaiian language and culture in its curriculum. The KapƒÅlama high school offers a six-year program in Hawaiian language and requires its students to achieve Hawaiian language proficiency equivalent to one year of study. It also offers various supplementary courses in Hawaiian culture, history, literature, song composition and performance, chant, dance, and crafts. Community outreach Kamehameha offers several distance learning programs for high school students, adults, and educators to learn Hawaiian language and culture over the Internet. The program includes an archived series of instructional videos entitled KulƒÅiwi for learning the Hawaiian language; these are available for free online streaming. Kamehameha also operates Kamehameha Publishing, which prints and sells Hawaiian-language books, posters, and multimedia. As a part of its 2000-2015 Strategic Plan, generated by wide community input, Kamehameha Schools partners with more than 20 community-based organizations across the archipelago through its Aina Ulu program to deliver natural and cultural resource stewardship education programs and services to over 25,000 participants annually. Aina Ulu provides an asset-management strategy by integrating community, education, cultural, environmental and economic outcomes to manage resources and lands to enhance prudent and sustainable use, responsible stewardship and supportive community relationships. By engaging community volunteers and expertise, Aina Ulu partners manage, protect and restore native watershed, dryland and rain forests; riparian, coastal, and estuarine ecosystems, including Hawaiian fishponds; and Hawaiian food systems, including dry field systems, as well as wet field systems call loi. Kamehameha also offers several programs and services for high school graduates. Along with the Ke Alii Pauahi Foundation, Kamehameha offers a variety of need- and merit-based scholarships for those pursuing undergraduate and postgraduate education. Its career counseling program provides advice and counseling for post-high school students and operates an internship program for various companies statewide. The First Nations' Futures Program, operated in conjunction with Stanford University and the University of Hawai ªi at MƒÅnoa, is a fellowship program designed to develop \\"a select team of emerging leaders... to become significant community contributors in natural, cultural and land stewardship.\\" Song contest alt=Program from the first song contest of the School for Boys, on May 26, 1921 The Kamehameha Schools Song Contest is an annual choral competition in which groups of students of the KapƒÅlama campus perform Hawaiian mele. The event held in Honolulu is broadcast live on TV and is also streamed live online. According to the 2008 program, the goals of the contest are to develop leadership and foster cooperation and class spirit among the students as well as to increase student awareness of their cultural heritage by allowing them to use their singing voices to express themselves. The first contest (then called the Inter-class Sing Competition) was held in 1921. It was started to perpetuate the memory of George Alanson Andrus, a music teacher at the School. The event was originally held on campus, but moved to the Neal Blaisdell Center (formerly the Honolulu International Auditorium) in 1964 where it has been held ever since. The 2008 contest was featured in the PBS documentary One Voice. Notable people * Isabella Abbott ‚Äì Class of 1937, authority on Central Pacific Algae and Hawaiian Plants * Daniel K.

Present in marine environments such as estuaries, brackish ponds, or coastal areas, V. vulnificus is related to 'V. cholerae', the causative agent of cholera. Infection with V. vulnificus leads to rapidly expanding cellulitis or sepsis. It was first isolated as a source of disease in 1976. Signs and symptoms V. vulnificus is an extremely virulent bacterium that can cause three types of infections: *Acute gastroenteritis from eating raw or undercooked shellfish: V. vulnificus causes an infection often incurred after eating seafood, especially raw or undercooked oysters. It does not alter the appearance, taste, or odor of oysters. Symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. *Necrotizing wound infections can occur in injured skin exposed to contaminated marine water. V. vulnificus bacteria can enter the body through open wounds when swimming or wading in infected waters, or by puncture wounds from the spines of fishes such as stingrays. People may develop a blistering dermatitis sometimes mistaken for pemphigus or pemphigoid. *Invasive sepsis can occur after eating raw or undercooked shellfish, especially oysters. V. vulnificus is 80 times more likely to spread into the bloodstream in people with compromised immune systems, especially those with chronic liver disease. When this happens, severe symptoms including blistering skin lesions and septic shock can sometimes lead to death. This severe infection may occur regardless of whether the infection began from contaminated food or an open wound. Among healthy people, ingestion of V. vulnificus can cause vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. In someone with a compromised immune system, particularly those with chronic liver disease, it can infect the bloodstream, causing a severe and life-threatening illness characterized by fever and chills, decreased blood pressure (septic shock), and blistering skin lesions. While men have been shown to be more at risk from this infection than women, co-morbidities such as alcoholic cirrhosis and diseases affecting the endocrine system (diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.) put a person far more at risk to develop infection from V. vulnificus. Pathogenesis Capsule: V. vulnificus has a capsule, made of polysaccharides, and is thought to protect against phagocytosis. The capsule also aids the bacteria in escaping opsonization. Different strains of the bacteria are capable of shifting through the unencapsulated and encapsulated forms. Mouse models have shown that the unencapsulated forms are avirulent. These same strains however, are shown to have a higher predisposition to shift to the virulent encapsulated form when taken up by oysters. Endotoxin: Like all gram negative bacteria, V. vulnificus has LPS (lipopolysaccharide as the major component of its outer membrane). However, the LPS the bacteria produces isn't as efficient at triggering the immune system's release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha and other cytokines that produce shock syndromes. The capsular proteins the bacteria express however, are capable of producing an immune response contributing to shock syndrome. Exotoxin: V. vulnificus produces a number of extracellular toxins such as metalloprotease VvpE, cytolysin/hemolysin VvhA, and the multifunctional autoprocessing repeats-in-toxins (MARTX) toxin. While the VvhA and MARTX toxin are factors in the bacteria's virulence, in vivo studies in mice suggest that the MARTX toxin is more responsible for bacterial dissemination from the intestine to produce sepsis. Iron: Growth of V. vulnificus is dependent on the amount of iron that is accessible to the bacteria. The observed association of the infection with liver disease (associated with increased serum iron) might be due to the capability of more virulent strains to capture iron bound to transferrin.Oxford handbook of Infect Dis and Microbiol, 2009  Strains  The most harmful strains of V. vulnificus documented have been observed in three different forms. The first is in an anti-phagocytic polysaccharide capsule that protects the bacteria. By encapsulating the bacteria, phagocytosis and opsonization are not able to occur, thus allowing the bacteria to continue throughout the organism it is in. The second way that V. vulnificus has been most harmful is with some of the toxins that it creates. These toxins are not part of the infection that V. vulnificus causes but instead they are part of a secondary infection in the GI tract that most certainly will lead to systemic infection. Lastly, V. vulnificus has been seen to cause more harm in patients who have higher levels of iron. Treatment V. vulnificus wound infections have a mortality rate around 25%. In people in whom the infection worsens into sepsis, typically following ingestion, the mortality rate rises to 50%. The majority of these people die within the first 48 hours of infection. The optimal treatment is not known, but in one retrospective study of 93 people in Taiwan, use of a third-generation cephalosporin and a tetracycline (e.g., ceftriaxone and doxycycline, respectively) was associated with an improved outcome. Prospective clinical trials are needed to confirm this finding, but in vitro data support the supposition that this combination is synergistic against V. vulnificus. Likewise, the American Medical Association and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend treating the person with a quinolone or intravenous doxycycline with ceftazidime. The first successful documented treatment of fulminant V. vulnificus sepsis was in 1995. Treatment was ceftazidime and intravenous (IV) ciprofloxacin and IV doxycycline, which proved successful. Prevention of secondary infections from respiratory failure and acute renal failure is crucial. Key to the diagnosis and treatment were the early recognition of bullae in an immunocompromised person with liver cirrhosis and oyster ingestion within the previous 48 hours, and the request by the physician for STAT Gram staining and blood cultures for V. vulnificus. V. vulnificus often causes large, disfiguring ulcers that require extensive debridement or even amputation. Prognosis V. vulnificus may not be a commonly known bacteria, but it is, however, the most common cause of death due to seafood in the United States. Infection and mortality due to V. vulnificus causes over 95% of deaths in the United States that are known to have occurred due to ingested seafood. Surprisingly enough, while V. vulnificus claims 95% of seafood related deaths, if treatment with tetracycline or other cephalosporin antibiotics is initiated at the onset of symptoms and is managed appropriately, patients will experience no long term effects, provided they continue to take the full course of antibiotics -- typically about two weeks. The worst prognosis is in those people arriving at hospital in a state of shock. Total mortality in treated people (ingestion and wound) is around 33%. People especially vulnerable are those with liver disease (especially cirrhosis and hepatitis) or immunocompromised states (some kinds of cancer, bone marrow suppression, HIV, diabetes, etc.). With these cases, V. vulnificus usually enters the bloodstream, where it may cause fever and chills, septic shock (with sharply decreased blood pressure), and blistering skin lesions. About half of those who contract blood infections die. V. vulnificus infections also disproportionately affect males; 85% of those developing endotoxic shock from the bacteria are male. Females having had an oophorectomy experienced increased mortality rates, as estrogen has been shown experimentally to have a protective effect against V. vulnificus. Epidemiology V. vulnificus is commonly found in the Gulf of Mexico, where more than a dozen people have died from the infection since 1990. Most deaths at that time were occurring due to fulminant sepsis, either in the area of oyster harvest and ingestion, or in tourists returning home. Lack of disease recognition, and also of the risk factors, presentation, and cause, were and are major obstacles to good outcome and recovery. After the successful treatment of the first person, the Florida Department of Health was able to trace the origin of the outbreak to Apalachicola Bay oysters and their harvesting in water prone to excessive growth of the organism. This contamination was due to warmth of the water and change in freshwater dilution because of a change in flow of the Chattahoochee River into the Apalachicola River, and in turn into Apalachicola Bay. A similar situation occurred after Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.  Further Treatment Research  While the treatment for V. vulnificus can be as straightforward as making the rapid choice of appropriate antibiotics, there have been cases in which the genes mutated, thus rendering antibiotics ineffective. While looking for an answer to this problem, researchers found that one way to stop the infection from spreading is to again mutate the bacteria. This mutation happens on the flagellum of the bacteria. When injected with flgC and flgE (two genes in the flagella that cause the mutation), the flagellum no longer function properly. When unable to move normally, the bacteria is no longer able to spread toxins through the body, thus decreasing the effect that V. vulnificus has on the body systemically. History The pathogen was first isolated in 1976 from a series of blood culture samples submitted to the CDC in Atlanta. It was described as a \\"lactose-positive vibrio\\". It was subsequently given the name Beneckea vulnifica, and finally Vibrio vulnificus by Farmer in 1979. Increasing seasonal temperatures and decreasing coastal salinity levels seem to favor a greater concentration of Vibrio within filter-feeding shellfish of the US Atlantic seaboard and the Gulf of Mexico, especially oysters (Crassostrea virginica). Scientists have frequently demonstrated the presence of V. vulnificus in the gut of oysters and other shellfish and in the intestines of fish that inhabit oyster reefs. The vast majority of people who develop sepsis from V. vulnificus became ill after they ate raw oysters; most of these cases have been men. In 2005, health officials clearly identified strains of V. vulnificus infections among evacuees from New Orleans due to the flooding there caused by Hurricane Katrina. In 2015 in Florida, eight cases of V. vulnificus infection with two resulting in death were reported. Natural transformation Natural transformation is a bacterial adaptation for DNA transfer between individual cells. V. vulnificus was found to become naturally transformable during growth on chitin in the form of crab shells. The ability to now carry out transformation experiments in the laboratory should facilitate molecular genetic analysis of this opportunistic pathogen.

A tetraquark state has long been suspected to be allowed by quantum chromodynamics, the modern theory of strong interactions. A tetraquark state is an example of an exotic hadron which lies outside the conventional quark model classification. History and Discoveries Several tetraquark candidates have been reported by particle physics experiments in the 21st century. The quark contents of these states are almost all qQ, where q represents a light (up, down or strange) quark, Q represents a heavy (charm or bottom) quark, and antiquarks are denoted with an overline. The existence and stability of tetraquark states with the qq (or QQ) have been discussed by theoretical physicists for a long time, however these are yet to be reported by experiments. Colour flux tubes produced by four static quark and antiquark charges, computed in lattice QCD. Confinement in Quantum Chromo Dynamics leads to the production of flux tubes connecting colour charges. The flux tubes act as attractive QCD string-like potentials. In 2003 a particle temporarily called X(3872), by the Belle experiment in Japan, was proposed to be a tetraquark candidate, as originally theorized. The name X is a temporary name, indicating that there are still some questions about its properties to be tested. The number following is the mass of the particle in . In 2004, the DsJ(2632) state seen in Fermilab's SELEX was suggested as a possible tetraquark candidate. In 2007, Belle announced the observation of the Z(4430) state, a tetraquark candidate. There are also indications that the Y(4660), also discovered by Belle in 2007, could be a tetraquark state. In 2009, Fermilab announced that they have discovered a particle temporarily called Y(4140), which may also be a tetraquark. In 2010, two physicists from DESY and a physicist from Quaid-i-Azam University re-analyzed former experimental data and announced that, in connection with the (5S) meson (a form of bottomonium), a well-defined tetraquark resonance exists. In June 2013, the BES III experiment in China and the Belle experiment in Japan independently reported on Zc(3900), the first confirmed four-quark state. In 2014, the Large Hadron Collider experiment LHCb confirmed the existence of the Z(4430) state with a significance of over 13.9 œÉ. In February 2016, the D√ò experiment reported evidence of a narrow tetraquark candidate, named X(5568), decaying to . In December 2017, D√ò also reported observing the X(5568) using a different final state. However, it was not observed in searches by the LHCb, CMS, CDF, or ATLAS experiments. In June 2016, LHCb announced the discovery of three additional tetraquark candidates, called X(4274), X(4500) and X(4700).Announcement by LHCb In 2020, LHCb announced the discovery of a tetraquark: X(6900).

From 1985 to 1997, it was known as the Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Journalism. The Pulitzer Prize Board announced the new category in November 1984, citing a series of explanatory articles that seven months earlier had won the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing. The series, \\"Making It Fly\\" by Peter Rinearson of The Seattle Times, was a 29,000-word account of the development of the Boeing 757 jetliner. It had been entered in the National Reporting category, but judges moved it to Feature Writing to award it a prize. In the aftermath, the Pulitzer Prize Board said it was creating the new category in part because of the ambiguity about where explanatory accounts such as \\"Making It Fly\\" should be recognized. The Pulitzer Committee issues an official citation explaining the reasons for the award.

Founded in 1889, it is the largest museum in Hawai'i and has the world's largest collection of Polynesian cultural artifacts and natural history specimens. Besides the comprehensive exhibits of Hawaiiana, the museum's total holding of natural history specimens exceeds 24 million, of which the entomological collection alone represents more than 13.5 million specimens (making it the third-largest insect collection in the United States). The museum is accessible on public transit: TheBus Routes A, 1, 2, 7, 10. The museum complex is home to the Richard T. Mamiya Science Adventure Center. Establishment Ke Ali ªi Bernice Pauahi Paki Bishop's husband, Charles Reed Bishop, created the museum to preserve royal heirlooms passed down to him upon his wife's death. Charles Reed Bishop (1822‚Äì1915), a businessman and philanthropist, co- founder of the First Hawaiian Bank and Kamehameha Schools, built the museum in memory of his late wife, Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop (1831‚Äì1884). Born into the royal family, she was the last legal heir of the Kamehameha Dynasty, which had ruled the Kingdom of Hawaii between 1810 and 1872. Bishop had originally intended the museum to house family heirlooms passed down to him through the royal lineage of his wife. Bishop hired William Tufts Brigham as the first curator of the museum; Brigham later served as director from 1898 until his retirement in 1918. The museum was built on the original boys' campus of Kamehameha Schools, an institution created at the bequest of the Princess, to benefit native Hawaiian children; she gave details in her last will and testament. In 1898, Bishop had Hawaiian Hall and Polynesian Hall built on the campus, in the popular Richardsonian Romanesque architectural style. The Pacific Commercial Advertiser newspaper dubbed these two structures as \\"the noblest buildings of Honolulu\\". Today both halls are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Hawaiian Hall is home to a complete sperm-whale skeleton, accompanied by a papier-m√¢ch√© body suspended above the central gallery. Along the walls are prized koa wood display cases; today this wood in total is worth more than the original Bishop Museum buildings. Later development In 1940, Kamehameha Schools moved to its new campus in KapƒÅlama, allowing the museum to expand at the original campus site. Bishop Hall, first built for use by the school, was adapted for museum use. Most other school structures were razed, and new museum facilities were constructed. By the late 1980s, the Bishop Museum had become the largest natural and cultural history institution in Polynesia. In 1988, construction of the Castle Memorial Building was begun. Dedicated on January 13, 1990, Castle Memorial Building houses all the major traveling exhibits that come to the Bishop Museum from institutions around the world. The Richard T. Mamiya Science Adventure Center opened in November 2005. The building is designed as a learning center for children, and includes many interactive exhibits focused on marine science, volcanology, and related sciences. Library and archives The museum library has one of the most extensive collections of books, periodicals, newspapers and special collections concerned with Hawai'i and the Pacific. The archives hold the results of extensive studies done by museum staff in the Pacific Basin, as well as manuscripts, photographs, artwork, oral histories, commercial sound recordings and maps. Many of Hawai ªi's royalty, including Bernice Pauahi Bishop and Queen Lili ªuokalani, deposited their personal papers at Bishop Museum. Manuscripts in the collection also include scientific papers, genealogical records, and memorabilia. The book collection consists of approximately 50,000 volumes with an emphasis on the cultural and natural history of Hawai'i and the Pacific, with subject strengths in anthropology, music, botany, entomology, and zoology. The library provides extra access to the collection of published diaries, narratives, memoirs, and other writings relating to 18th- and 19th-century Hawai'i.

Also on the campus is Pauahi Hall, home to the J. Linsley Gressit Center for Research in Entomology, which houses some 14 million prepared specimens of insects and related arthropods, including over 16,500 primary types. It is the third- largest entomology collection in the United States and the eighth-largest in the world. An active research facility, Pauahi Hall is not open to the public. Nearby is PƒÅkƒ´ Hall, home to the Hawaii Sports Hall of Fame, a museum library and archives, which are open to the public. From 1988 until 2009, the Bishop Museum also administered the Hawaii Maritime Center in downtown Honolulu. Built on a former private pier of Honolulu Harbor for the royal family, the center was the premier maritime museum in the Pacific Rim with artifacts in relation to the Pacific whaling industry and the Hawaii steamship industry. On the Big Island of Hawai'i, the Bishop Museum administers the Amy B.H. Greenwell Ethnobotanical Garden, specializing in indigenous Hawaiian plant life. Since 1920, the Secretariat of the Pacific Science Association (PSA), founded that year as an independent regional, non-governmental, scholarly organization, has been based at Bishop Museum. It seeks to advance science and technology in support of sustainable development in the Asia-Pacific.  Kaimiloa Expedition  In 1924, American millionaire, Medford Ross Kellum, outfitted a four masted barquentine for a scientific expedition which, even the naming of the ship Kaimiloa, was left entirely to the scientific circles of Honolulu.\\"The Trustees and staff of the Museum are fairly bubbling with pleasure at finding that their dream of an exploring ship, reaching places otherwise inaccessible, has become a reality through interest of yourself and Mrs. Kellum. (...) It takes some talking to convince the trustees that you want your name submerged and that you don't care a whoop what the ship does or where it goes so long as you two friendly souls can render service by increasing knowledge of the Pacific.\\" Director Gregory, Honolulu Museum, May 31, 1924. The goal of the expedition was a five-year exploration of many of the then inaccessible spots of the Pacific. Under the auspices of the Bishop Museum, a group of Hawaiian scientists joined the ship: Gerrit P. Wilder, botanist; Mrs. Wilder, historian; Kenneth Emory, ethnologist; Dr. Armstrong Sperry, writer and illustrator; and Dr. Stanley Ball. The vessel was a complete floating laboratory, possibly the most complete of any craft that has undertaken a similar trip. Bottles, crates, and boxes were stowed below, along with gallons of preservatives for insects and plant specimens for the Bishop Museum. The goals of the expedition were exhaustive: * complete collections of islands subjects ranging from insects, plants, minerals, and archaeological and ethnological specimens, * study of the fish and sea life, * chart as accurately as possible the ocean currents, * for the United States government, conform and correct to the findings of the expedition the charts of the island groups, * attempt to trace the origin of the Polynesians, their language and their migrations, * photograph the natives and measure accurately portions of their bodies, * record phonographically records of the speech, the songs, their chants, * sound the ocean floor and study the formation of the islands in an effort to prove the unfounded but at the time prevalent theory that some Pacific islands were once a part of the mainland and that they formed a \\"lost continent\\". Falls of Clyde From 1968 until September 2008, the Bishop Museum owned the Falls of Clyde, the oldest sail-driven oil tanker, which was moored at the Hawai‚Äòi Maritime Center. In early 2007, the ship was closed to public tours for safety reasons and in order to facilitate repairs to the deteriorating tank, which frequently caused the ship to list (tilt) dramatically. Marine experts conducted a thorough inspection of the ship. Between 1998 and 2008 the museum incurred more than $2 million in preservation costs. The museum threatened to sink the ship by the end of 2008 unless private funds were raised for a perpetual care endowment. On September 28, 2008, ownership was transferred to the non-profit group, Friends of Falls of Clyde, which intends to restore the ship. In October of that same year, the Bishop Museum was criticized for having raised $600,000 to preserve the ship, and spent only about half that on the ship, and that for sandblasting that was determined to damage the integrity of the vessel. The media also pointed out other questionable spending decisions.

Bombard players from Bagad Ronsed-Mor. A bagad (, ) is a Breton band, composed of bagpipes (Breton: binio√π, French: cornemuse), bombards and drums (including snare, tenor and bass drums). The pipe band tradition in Brittany was inspired by the Scottish example and has developed since the mid-20th century. A bagad plays mainly Breton music, but a bagad's music is evolutionary: new forms and musical ideas are experimented with at each annual national competition. The plural for bagad is unusual in that many are referred to as bagado√π but for two, three or any other specified number they are simply referred to as bagad (following the rules of Breton grammar). Every major town and city in Brittany has at least one bagad and there are over eighty in total. There are also many bagado√π outside Brittany, owing to large-scale Breton emigration throughout France. Bagad Lann Bihoue is well known to belong to the French Navy. For competition purposes the bagado√π are ranked into five categories. Major competitions take place annually in Brest and in Lorient, where the National Championship takes place during the Interceltic Festival in August.

Spline interpolation is often preferred over polynomial interpolation because the interpolation error can be made small even when using low degree polynomials for the spline. Spline interpolation avoids the problem of Runge's phenomenon, in which oscillation can occur between points when interpolating using high degree polynomials. Introduction Originally, spline was a term for elastic rulers that were bent to pass through a number of predefined points (\\"knots\\"). These were used to make technical drawings for shipbuilding and construction by hand, as illustrated by Figure 1. Figure 1: Interpolation with cubic splines between eight points. Hand-drawn technical drawings were made for shipbuilding etc. using flexible rulers that were bent to follow pre-defined points The approach to mathematically modelling the shape of such elastic rulers fixed by knots \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ (x_i,y_i) : i=0,1,\\\\cdots,n \\\\right \\\\\\\\} is to interpolate between all the pairs of knots (x_{i-1}, y_{i-1}) and (x_{i}, y_{i}) with polynomials y=q_i(x), i=1,2,\\\\cdots,n. The curvature of a curve y=f(x) is given by: :\\\\kappa= \\\\frac{y}{(1+y'^2)^{3/2}} As the spline will take a shape that minimizes the bending (under the constraint of passing through all knots) both y' and y will be continuous everywhere and at the knots. To achieve this one must have that :\\\\begin{cases} q'_i(x_i) = q'_{i+1}(x_i)  q_i(x_i) = q_{i+1}(x_i) \\\\end{cases} \\\\qquad 1 \\\\le i \\\\le n-1 This can only be achieved if polynomials of degree 3 or higher are used. The classical approach is to use polynomials of degree 3 -- the case of cubic splines. Algorithm to find the interpolating cubic spline A third-order polynomial q(x) for which :q(x_1)=y_1 :q(x_2)=y_2 :q'(x_1)=k_1 :q'(x_2)=k_2 can be written in the symmetrical form where As :q'= \\\\frac{d q}{d x} = \\\\frac{d q}{d t} \\\\frac{d t}{d x} = \\\\frac{d q}{d t} \\\\frac{1}{x_2-x_1} one gets that: \\\\+ \\\\left(\\\\frac {1}{x_i- x_{i-1}}+ \\\\frac {1}{{x_{i+1}-x_i}}\\\\right) 2k_i+ \\\\frac {k_{i+1}}{{x_{i+1}-x_i}} = 3 \\\\left(\\\\frac {y_i - y_{i-1}}{{(x_i-x_{i-1})}^2}+\\\\frac {y_{i+1} - y_i}{{(x_{i+1}-x_i)}^2}\\\\right)}} for i = 1, ..., n-1. The relations () are linear equations for the values . For the elastic rulers being the model for the spline interpolation one has that to the left of the left-most \\"knot\\" and to the right of the right-most \\"knot\\" the ruler can move freely and will therefore take the form of a straight line with . As should be a continuous function of one gets that for \\"Natural Splines\\" one in addition to the linear equations () should have that :q_1(x_0) =2 \\\\frac {3(y_1 - y_0)-(k_1+2k_0)(x_1-x_0)}{{(x_1-x_0)}^2}=0, :q_n(x_n) =-2 \\\\frac {3(y_n - y_{n-1})-(2k_n+k_{n-1})(x_n-x_{n-1})}{{(x_n-x_{n-1})}^2}=0, i.e. that k_{n-1} +\\\\frac{2}{x_n-x_{n-1}}k_n = 3 \\\\frac{y_n-y_{n-1}}{(x_n-x_{n-1})^2}.}} Eventually, () together with () and () constitute linear equations that uniquely define the parameters . There exist other end conditions: \\"Clamped spline\\", that specifies the slope at the ends of the spline, and the popular \\"not-a-knot spline\\", that requires that the third derivative is also continuous at the and points. For the \\"not-a-knot\\" spline, the additional equations will read: :q_1(x_1) =q_2(x_1) \\\\Rightarrow \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Delta x_1^2} k_0 + \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Delta x_1^2} - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Delta x_2^2} \\\\right) k_1 - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Delta x_2^2} k_2 = 2 \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\Delta y_1}{\\\\Delta x_1^3} - \\\\frac{\\\\Delta y_2}{\\\\Delta x_2^3} \\\\right) :q_{n-1}(x_{n-1}) =q_n(x_{n-1}) \\\\Rightarrow \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Delta x_{n-1}^2} k_{n-2} + \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Delta x_{n-1}^2} - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Delta x_n^2} \\\\right) k_{n-1} - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Delta x_n^2} k_n = 2\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\Delta y_{n-1} }{\\\\Delta x_{n-1}^3 }- \\\\frac{ \\\\Delta y_n}{ \\\\Delta x_n^3 } \\\\right) where \\\\Delta x_i = x_i - x_{i-1}, \\\\Delta y_i = y_i - y_{i-1} . Example Figure 2: Interpolation with cubic \\"natural\\" splines between three points. In case of three points the values for k_0,k_1,k_2 are found by solving the tridiagonal linear equation system : \\\\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & 0  a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23}  0 & a_{32} & a_{33}  \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} k_0  k_1  k_2  \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} b_1  b_2  b_3  \\\\end{bmatrix} with :a_{11}=\\\\frac{2}{x_1-x_0} :a_{12}=\\\\frac{1}{x_1-x_0} :a_{21}=\\\\frac{1}{x_1-x_0} :a_{22}=2\\\\ \\\\left(\\\\frac {1}{x_1-x_0}+ \\\\frac {1}\\\\right) :a_{23}=\\\\frac {1} :a_{32}=\\\\frac{1}{x_2-x_1} :a_{33}=\\\\frac{2}{x_2-x_1} :b_1=3\\\\ \\\\frac{y_1-y_0}{(x_1-x_0)^2} :b_2=3\\\\ \\\\left(\\\\frac {y_1 - y_0}{{(x_1-x_0)}^2}+\\\\frac {y_2 - y_1}{{(x_2-x_1)}^2}\\\\right) :b_3=3\\\\ \\\\frac{y_2-y_1}{(x_2-x_1)^2} For the three points :(-1,0.5)\\\\ ,\\\\ (0,0)\\\\ ,\\\\ (3,3), one gets that :k_0=-0.6875\\\\ ,\\\\ k_1=-0.1250\\\\ ,\\\\ k_2=1.5625 and from () and () that :a_1= k_0(x_1-x_0)-(y_1 - y_0)=-0.1875 :b_1=-k_1(x_1-x_0)+(y_1 - y_0)=-0.3750 :a_2= k_1(x_2-x_1)-(y_2 - y_1)=-3.3750 :b_2=-k_2(x_2-x_1)+(y_2 - y_1)=-1.6875 In Figure 2, the spline function consisting of the two cubic polynomials q_1(x) and q_2(x) given by () is displayed.

Most production aircraft were constructed under contract by various private companies, both established aircraft manufacturers and firms that had not previously built aircraft. Around 3,500 were manufactured in all. Early versions of the B.E.2 entered squadron service with the Royal Flying Corps in 1912; the type continued to serve throughout the First World War. It was initially used as a front-line reconnaissance aircraft and light bomber; modified as a single-seater it proved effective as a night fighter, destroying several German airships. By late 1915, the B.E.2 was proving inadequate in defending itself against German fighters such as the then-new Fokker Eindecker, leading to increased losses during the period known as the Fokker Scourge. Although by now obsolete, it had to remain on the front line while suitable replacements were designed, tested and brought into service. Following its belated withdrawal from operations, the type served in various second-line capacities, seeing use as a trainer and communications aircraft, as well as performing anti-submarine coastal patrol duties. The B.E.2 has always been a subject of controversy, both at the time and in later historical assessment. From the B.E.2c variant on it had been carefully adapted to be \\"inherently stable\\"; this feature was considered helpful in its artillery observation and aerial photography duties, most of which were assigned to the pilot, who was able to fly without constant attention to his flight controls. Despite a tendency to swing on takeoff and a reputation for spinning, the type had a relatively low accident rate. The stability of the type was however achieved at the expense of heavy controls, making rapid manoeuvring difficult. The observer, often not carried because of the B.E.'s poor payload, occupied the front seat, where he had a limited field of fire for his gun. Development =Background= The B.E.2 was one of the first fixed-wing aircraft to be designed at what was then called the Royal Balloon Factory (the organisation was formally renamed as the Royal Aircraft Factory on 26 April 1911).Hare 1990, p. 36. The team responsible for its design came under the direction of British engineer Mervyn O'Gorman, the factory's superintendent. The B.E.2 designation was formulated in accordance with the system devised by O'Gorman, which classified aircraft by their layout: B.E. stood for Bl√©riot Experimental, and was used for aircraft of tractor configuration (although in practice, all of the B.E. types were biplanes rather than the monoplanes typical of the Bleriot company).Hare 1990, p. 35. At first, the activities of the Factory were limited to the conduct of research into aerodynamics and aircraft design and the construction or design of actual aircraft was not officially sanctioned. O'Gorman got around this restriction by using the factory's responsibility for the repair and maintenance of aircraft belonging to the Royal Flying Corps; existing aircraft that needed major repairs were nominally reconstructed but often actually transformed into new designs, which generally retained few original elements apart from the engine.Cheesman 1962, p. 46. The first pair of B.E. aircraft were flown within two months of each other and had the same basic design, the work of Geoffrey de Havilland, who was at the time both the chief designer and the test pilot at the Balloon Factory.Hare 1990, p. 31. The layout of these aircraft came to be seen as conventional, but when it first appeared this was not the case. Rather, in common with the contemporary Avro 500, the B.E.2 was one of the designs which established the tractor biplane as the dominant aircraft layout for a considerable time.Gibbs-Smith 2003, pp. 192‚Äì193. Following its first public appearance in early January 1912, aviation publication Flight commented that: \\"everything one could see of the machine was of singular interest\\".\\"The New Army Aeroplane.\\" Flight, 6 January 1912.Bruce 1966, p. 3. =B.E.1= B.E.1., originally captioned 'The Silent Army Aeroplane'. Note radiator between cabane struts. This was ostensibly a rebuild of a Voisin biplane, powered by a 60 hp (45 kW) water-cooled Wolseley engine; however, the B.E.1 used only the engine and radiator from this machine, the radiator being mounted between the front pair of cabane struts. The B.E.1 was a two-bay tractor biplane ‚Äì it had parallel-chord unstaggered wings with rounded ends, using wing warping for roll control. The wings were of unequal span: upper wingspan was and lower .Hare 2012, p. 15. The fuselage was a rectangular section fabric-covered wire- braced structure, with the pilot seated aft, behind the wings and the observer in front, under the centre section. This arrangement was adopted so that the aircraft could be flown \\"solo\\" without affecting the aircraft's centre of gravity. Behind the pilot's position, a curved top decking extended aft to the tail, although the forward decking and cowling of later variants was not fitted at this stage. The aircraft's tail surfaces consisted of a half-oval horizontal stabiliser with a split elevator mounted above the upper longerons and an ovoid rudder hinged to the sternpost; there was no fixed vertical fin. The main undercarriage consisted of a pair of skids each carried on an inverted V-strut at their rear and a single raked strut at the front: an axle carrying the wheels was bound to the skids by bungee cords and restrained by radius rods. A sprung tailskid was fitted, while the wings were also protected by semicircular skids located beneath the lower wings.Bruce 1982, p. 394. The B.E.1 represented several firsts for aviation, including possibly being the first aeroplane to be outfitted with radio apparatus.Bruce 1966, p. 4. It was first flown by de Havilland on 4 December 1911.Hare 2012, p. 19. The aircraft was not flown again until 27 December, modified by the substitution of a Claudel carburettor in place of the original Wolseley, which allowed no throttle control. Other minor modifications were made over the following weeks: the undercarriage wheels were moved back 12 in (30.4 cm), the wings (which originally had no dihedral), were re-rigged to have 1¬∞ dihedral, and the propeller was cut down in an attempt to increase the engine speed. Later, the Wolseley engine was replaced by a 60 hp (45 kW) air-cooled Renault.Hare 2012, p. 18. =B.E.2= The B.E.2 was almost identical to the B.E.1, differing principally in being powered by a 60 hp (45 kW) air-cooled Renault V-8 engine and in having equal-span wings. Its new number was not allocated because it was considered a separate type. The numbers allocated to early Royal Aircraft Factory prototypes are more properly regarded as constructor's numbers than as type designations.Hare 2012, p. 23. Sometimes described as a \\"rebuild\\" of an existing aircraft, either a Bristol Boxkite or a Breguet, it seems in fact to have been the first aeroplane built at the factory without the subterfuge of being a \\"reconstruction\\". It first flew on 1 February 1912, again with de Havilland as the test pilot.Bruce 1982, p. 344. The Renault proved a much more satisfactory powerplant than the Wolseley fitted to the B.E.1, and performance was further improved when a 70 hp (52 kW) model was fitted in May that year.Hare 1990, p. 138. The B.E.2 was flown extensively at the Military Aeroplane Competition held on Salisbury Plain during August 1912. It was not allowed to formally compete in the trials since O'Gorman was one of the judges, but its performance was clearly superior to most of the aircraft competing: on 12 August 1912, the B.E.2 established a new British altitude record of 10,560 ft (3,219 m), while being flown by de Havilland and with Major F. H. Sykes on board as a passenger.Bruce 1954, p. 394. Several other prototypes of the production B.E.2 series were produced, including the B.E.5 and the B.E.6. These essentially only differed from the B.E.2 in the powerplant, initially an ENV liquid cooled engine, and since both aircraft were eventually fitted with the standard 70 hp Renault, they became effectively equivalent to the production standard B.E.2.Hare 2012, pp. 35‚Äì37. =B.E.2a= Early production B.E.2a: note lack of decking between cockpits and the unequal span wings. The designation B.E.2a was assigned to the first production aircraft. The B.E.2a designation first appeared on a drawing dated 20 February 1912, which showed an aircraft with unequal span wings with slight dihedral. These differed from preceding B.E.1 and B.E.2 in possessing a revised fuel system, in which the streamlined gravity tank below the centre section of the wing was moved to a position behind the engine. The main fuel tank remained under the observer's seat.Hare 2012, pp. 40‚Äì42. A B.E.2a in France, 1915 ‚Äì note \\"pre-roundel\\" markings Early production aircraft had unequal span wings, similar to those fitted on the B.E.1, and at first there was no decking between the pilot and observer's seats, although this was added later. Sandbag loading tests revealed that the safety margin of the rear spar was somewhat less than that of the front; to remedy this, a revised wing was designed with a deeper rear spar, and consequently a different aerofoil section. Later production aircraft also had equal-span wings. These modifications were retrofitted to the majority of the remaining earlier production aircraft. The first production order was placed with British manufacturing conglomerate Vickers;Hare 2012, p. 40. shortly afterwards, a second order was issued for the type's production by the Bristol Aeroplane Company.Hare 1990, p. 55. The first contractor-built B.E.2as appeared during the first weeks of 1913; during February of that year, at least two such aeroplanes were delivered to No.2 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps, these were possibly the first examples of the type to enter service.Bruce 1966, p. 6. =B.E.2b= The B.E.2b which followed the original production standard benefitted from various improvements. It featured revised cockpit coamings, which afforded better protection from the elements, along with revised controls to both the elevator and rudder.Bruce 1966, p. 8. Some aircraft ordered as B.E.2bs were completed as B.E.2cs, and others were built with some of the B.E.2c modifications, such as sump cowlings and \\"V\\" undercarriages. At the outbreak of war, these early B.E.2s formed part of the equipment of the first three squadrons of the RFC to be sent to France. A B.E.2a of No.2 Squadron was the first aircraft of the Royal Flying Corps to arrive in France after the start of the First World War, on 26 August 1914. Early model B.E.2c, with Renault engine, skid undercarriage, no cowling on sump, no cut-out in upper centre section =B.E.2c= The B.E.2c was a major redesign, the result of research by E.T. Busk intended to provide an inherently stable aeroplane. This was considered desirable to allow the crew's full attention to be devoted to reconnaissance duties. The first example, a converted B.E.2b, flew on 30 May 1914 and the type went into squadron service just before the outbreak of war.Hare 1990, pp. 147‚Äì148. Relatively large orders were placed for the new version, with deliveries of production aircraft starting in December 1914. During 1915, this model replaced the early B.E.2s in the squadrons in France.Bruce 1982, pp. 355‚Äì357. The B.E.2c used the same fuselage as the B.E.2b, but was otherwise really a new type, being fitted with new wings of different planform with increased dihedral and forward stagger, and ailerons replaced the wing warping of the earlier models. The tailplane was also completely new, and a triangular fin was fitted to the rudder. Operational B.E.2c with RAF 1a engine, \\"V\\" undercarriage, streamlined cowling on sump, and cut-out in upper centre section to improve field of fire for gunner After the first few aircraft, production machines were powered by a development of the Renault engine, the RAF 1a, and the twin skid undercarriage was replaced by a plain \\"V\\" undercarriage. A streamlined cowling to the sump was also fitted to later models, while a cut-out in the rear of the centre section marginally improved the observer's field of fire, as well as giving the pilot a better view forward over the wing. On later machines, the fin was enlarged to reduce the aircraft's tendency to swing on take-off and to improve spin recovery.Hare 2012, pp. 71‚Äì72. =B.E.2d= The B.E.2d was a dual control version of the \\"c\\" variant: provided with full controls in the front cockpit as well as in the rear.Hare 2012, p. 112. This modification meant that there was no longer room for the fuel tank under the observer's seat, which had to be replaced by a centre section gravity tank; in order to give the \\"d\\" a superior endurance this tank was unusually large, adding extra weight and drag that reduced the type's performance, particularly in the climb.Hare 2012, p. 112. Most B.E.2ds were used as trainers, and the few used on operations by the RFC seem to have been flown from the normal (rear) pilots' seat. Much modified B.E.2d in Belgian service, with Hispano engine, synchronised Vickers gun, improvised gun mounts and revised fuel system. On the other hand, photographs of B.E.2ds supplied to Belgium make it clear that not only were these re-engined with Hispano engines, but at least some of them had the pilot and observer's seating positions reversed, giving the latter a much better field of fire for his gun(s). Some of the Belgian B.E.2cs were similarly modified, while at least one was fitted with a Scarff ring over the rear cockpit. =B.E.2e= During 1916, the \\"c\\" began to be superseded by the final version, the B.E.2e. This variant was again distinguished by completely new wings, braced by a single pair of interplane struts per side (as a \\"single-bay\\" biplane), and a set of shorter wingspan lower wing panels. The ailerons, on upper and lower wings, were joined by light struts. The tailplane was again a new unit ‚Äì being smaller than that of the B.E.2c and d ‚Äì and the larger, quadrant shaped vertical fin of the late B.E.2c became standard.Hare 2012, pp. 114‚Äì115. A B.E.2e ‚Äì note the single bay wings with large overhang It was intended to fit a new, uprated version of the RAF 1 ‚Äì the RAF 1b ‚Äì but in the event this engine did not achieve production status, and the B.E.2e used the same engine as its predecessor, considerably reducing the expected improvement in performance.Hare 2012, p. 115. Many B.E.2c and B.E.2d aircraft still under construction when the new model entered production were completed with B.E.2e wings. To rationalise the supply of spare parts these aircraft were officially designated as the \\"B.E.2f\\" and \\"B.E.2g\\".Cheesman 1962, p. 50. About 3,500 B.E.2s were built by over 20 different manufacturers. An exact breakdown between the different models has never been produced, if only because so many B.E.2s were completed as later models than originally ordered.Hare 2012, pp. 115‚Äì156. The B.E.9 and the B.E.12 were variants developed to provide the B.E.2 with an effective forward-firing armament. The B.E.12 (a single-seater) went into production and saw squadron service, however neither variant was ultimately a great success; both designs having been superseded by newer fighter aircraft by the time they were completed.Penrose 1969, p. 100.Hare 1990, pp. 182‚Äì189. Operational history =Prewar service= During the pre-war period, those B.E.2s that had reached service were primarily flown by No 2, No 4 and No 6 Squadrons, who rapidly accumulated an unusually high number of flight hours on the type. Aviation author J.M. Bruce has commented that during this time, compared with their contemporaries, the early B.E.2s demonstrated a high standard of serviceability and reliability: as borne out by the squadrons' maintenance records.Bruce 1966, p. 7. During this time, multiple long-distance flights were conducted using individual B.E.2s, especially by personnel of No. 2. Squadron. On 22 May 1913, Captain Longcroft flew his aircraft from Farnborough Airport to Montrose Aerodrome, covering the 550 mile distance in ten hours, 55 minutes, with two intermediary stops. On 19 August 1913, Longcroft repeated this trip using a B.E.2 outfitted with an additional fuel tank, lowering the journey time to seven hours, 40 minutes with only one stop midway. A good deal of experimental flying was undertaken during this period, influencing later fuel system and undercarriage design as well as structural strengthening and aerodynamic changes.Bruce 1966, pp. 7‚Äì8. =Western Front= An aerial reconnaissance camera of 1916 as operated by the pilot of a B.E.2c The early models of the B.E. 2 had already served in the RFC for two years prior to the outbreak of the Great War, and were among the aircraft that arrived with the British Expeditionary Force in France during 1914. Like all service aircraft of this period, they had been designed at a time when the qualities required by a warplane were largely a matter for conjecture and speculation, in the absence of any actual experience of the use of aircraft in warfare: at this stage all the combatants were still feeling their way and aerial combat, especially the need for reconnaissance aircraft to be able to defend themselves, was not widely anticipated. As a result, the B.E.2 was originally designed without any provision for armament. In the absence of any official policy regarding armament, more aggressive crews improvised their own.Bruce 1966, pp. 9‚Äì10. While some flew entirely unarmed, or perhaps carried service revolvers or automatic pistols, others armed themselves with hand-wielded rifles or carbines as used by ground troops, or even fitted a Lewis gun. The performance of the early Renault powered models of the B.E. was degraded by any additional weight, and in any case the carriage of this weaponry proved of questionable effectiveness.Bruce 1966, p. 10. It was still necessary for the observer to be located over the centre of gravity, in front of the pilot, to ensure fore and aft balance when the aircraft was flown \\"solo\\". In this awkward position, his view was poor, and the degree to which he could handle a camera (or, later, a gun) was hampered by the struts and wires supporting the centre section of the top wing. In practice, the pilot of a B.E.2 almost always operated the camera, and the observer, when he was armed at all, had a rather poor field of fire to the rear, having, at best, to shoot back over his pilot's head.Woodman 189, p. 61. Whenever bombs were to be carried, or maximum endurance was required, the observer would normally have to be left behind. Nonetheless, the B.E.2s were already in use as light bombers as well as for visual reconnaissance; an attack on Courtrai Railway station on 26 April 1915 earning a posthumous Victoria Cross for 2nd Lt. William Rhodes-Moorhouse, the first such award to be made for an aerial operation.Bruce 1966, p. 9. By this time, prewar aircraft were already disappearing from RFC service. The type that replaced the B.E.2a and B.E.2b (as well as the assortment of other types in use at the time) in the reconnaissance squadrons of the RFC in 1915 was the B.E.2c, which had also been designed before the war. The most important difference in the new model was an improvement in stability ‚Äì a genuinely useful characteristic, especially in aerial photographic work, using the primitive plate cameras of the time, with their relatively long exposures. Unfortunately, in this case the stability was coupled with \\"heavy\\" controls and relatively poor manoeuvrability. A suitable engine was not available in sufficient quantities to replace the air-cooled Renault ‚Äì the RAF 1a being essentially an uprated version of the French engine ‚Äì so that the improvement in the B.E.2c's performance was less than startling. The vulnerability of the B.E.2c to fighter attack became plain in late 1915, with the advent of the Fokker Eindecker. This led the British press to disparagingly refer to the aircraft as being \\"Fokker Fodder\\", while German pilots also gave it the nickname of kaltes Fleisch (\\"cold meat\\"). British ace Albert Ball described the B.E.2c as \\"a bloody awful aeroplane\\". Unable to cope with such a primitive fighter as the Fokker E.I, it was virtually helpless against the newer German fighters of 1916‚Äì17. The aircraft's poor performance against the Fokker and the failure to improve the aircraft or replace it caused great controversy in England, with Noel Pemberton Billing attacking the B.E.2c and the Royal Aircraft Factory in the House of Commons on 21 March 1916, claiming that RFC pilots in France were being \\"rather murdered than killed\\".Bruce 16 April 1954, p. 478. This agitation prompted the setting up of two enquiries; one into the management of the Royal Aircraft Factory, and another into the high command of the Royal Flying Corps, the latter of which being headed by a judge. These reports largely cleared both Factory management and the RFC commanders responsible for ordering the B.E.2, but Mervyn O'Gorman was effectively dismissed as supervisor of the Factory by a \\"sideways promotion\\", while many of the most talented individuals amongst the factory's designers and engineers followed de Havilland into private industry.Hare 1990, pp. 92‚Äì100.\\"R.F.C Inquiry Committee:Interim Report.\\" Flight, 17 August 1916, pp. 696‚Äì699. Fokker Eindecker, the nemesis of the B.E.2 in 1915/early 1916 Once the threat from the Fokker monoplanes had been effectively contained by the introduction of a new generation of Allied fighters, such as the Airco D.H.2 and Nieuport 11, the rate of B.E.2c losses over the Western Front dropped to an acceptable level; official records indicate that during the second quarter of 1916, the B.E.2 actually had the lowest loss rates of all the major types then in use by the service.Bruce 1982, pp. 360‚Äì360. Encouraged by this, the RFC took delivery of large numbers of the BE.2e, which promised improved performance, and combined the stability of the B.E.2c with rather \\"lighter\\" controls (which held the promise of better manoeuvrability).Hare 1990, p. 160. By the spring of 1917, however, conditions on the Western Front had changed again; the German fighter squadrons having been re-equipped with better fighters, especially the Albatros D.III. It had been planned that by this time B.E.2s in front-line service would have been replaced by newer aircraft, such as the Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8 and Armstrong Whitworth F.K.8, but delivery of these types was initially slower than hoped. This situation culminated in what became known as \\"Bloody April\\", with the RFC losing 60 B.E.2s during that month.Bruce 1982, pp. 365‚Äì368. An incident illustrating both the poor level of piloting skills with which new RFC pilots were sent to France in 1917 and the level of popularity of the B.E.2e on the Western Front at that time is recorded by Arthur Gould Lee, then a young RFC novice, in his book No Parachute. On 19 May 1917, six pilots, newly arrived in France and still to be allocated to a squadron, were each given a new B.E.2e to ferry between RFC depots at St Omer and Candas. One crashed in transit, three crashed on landing and one went missing (the pilot was killed). Lee, the pilot of the only aircraft to arrive safely, wrote in a letter to his wife: :I felt rather a cad not crashing too because everyone is glad to see death-traps like Quirks written off, especially new ones.Lee 1968, p. 5. Fortunately, by this time, the B.E.2e was already being rapidly replaced on the Western Front by later types, but this was from several points of view more than a year too late. =Night fighter= As early as 1915, the B.E.2c entered service as a pioneer night fighter, being used in attempts to intercept and destroy the German airship raiders. The interceptor version of the B.E.2c was flown as a single- seater, outfitted with an auxiliary fuel tank on the centre of gravity in the position of the observer's seat. Among other projected weapons intended to attack airships from above, including Ranken darts and small incendiary bombs, was the Fiery Grapnel. Developed at the Royal Aircraft Factory, the grapnel consisted of a two-inch long hollow steel shaft packed with an explosive charge and fitted with a sharp four-sided nose and metal plates that acted as fins; this would have been attached to a winch-mounted cable and carried by a single B.E.2. It was intended for the fighter to approach a Zeppelin from above, after which the grapnel would be dropped and appropriate manoeuvring employed to strike the surface of the Zeppelin with it: it then would bury itself and explode, causing ignition of the airship's hydrogen gas. A simpler and much more practical solution proved to be to attack from below, using a Lewis gun firing a mixture of explosive and incendiary ammunition at an upwards angle of 45¬∞.Bruce 1968, pp. 15‚Äì18.A similar tactic of firing from below was employed in the Second World War by German night fighters armed with the so-called Schr√§ge Musik cannon installation. The new tactic proved to be highly effective. On the night of 2‚Äì3 September 1916, a single B.E.2c was credited with the downing of SL 11, the first German airship to be shot down over Britain after over a year of night raids.Knell 2003, pp. 109‚Äì111. This feat led to the pilot, Captain William Leefe Robinson, being awarded a Victoria Cross and various cash prizes, totalling up to ¬£3,500, that had been put up by a number of individuals.Penrose 1969, pp. 172‚Äì174. This was not an isolated victory; five more German airships were destroyed by Home Defence B.E.2c interceptors between October and December 1916. As a consequence of these losses, the German Army's airship fleet ceased raids over England: German naval airship raiders of 1917 flew at higher altitudes to avoid interception, reducing their effectiveness. Daylight raids by heavier-than-air bombers were also planned.Robinson 1971, pp. 204‚Äì209. The performance of the B.E.2 was inadequate to intercept airships flying at 15,000 feet much less the Gotha bombers that emerged during 1917, and its career as an effective home defence fighter was over. =Other fronts= While the majority of operational B.E.2s served on the Western Front, the type also saw limited use in other overseas theatres. At least one pair of B.E.2s were among the aircraft dispatched with No 3 Squadron for use in the Gallipoli Campaign. They were used to spot in support of naval bombardments, as well as being occasionally used to directly bomb ships and other targets.Bruce 1966, pp. 9, 12. As early as 1914, some B.E.2as went to Australia, where they served as trainer aircraft for the nascent Australian Flying Corps at Point Cook, Victoria. In a similar fashion, the type also was adopted at the Indian Flying School at Sitapur. At least one B.E.2 was dispatched to Egypt to reinforce friendly forces fighting in the Eastern Mediterranean; on 16 April 1915, this aircraft participated in the bombing of El Murra. A BE2e was lost in aerial combat over Salonika on 3 October 1917: the British pilot and observer were both killed and were buried by \\"The Bulgurs\\" with full military honours. Both were reinterred in Struma military cemetery.De Ruvigny‚Äôs Roll of Honour 1914-19, Vol 4, p226 =Airship gondola= An SS class airship using a B.E.2 fuselage as a gondola A number of B.E.2 fuselages were employed as makeshift gondolas for the hastily designed SS class \\"blimps\\", which were introduced into service by the Royal Naval Air Service for anti-submarine duties during March 1915. Later classes featured purpose-built gondolas.SS class airship. Airship Heritage Trust, Retrieved: 19 October 2015. =Non-combat use= From 1917 onwards, the B.E.2 was generally withdrawn from both the front line and night fighter use.Bruce 1966, p. 10. The surviving examples continued in use for submarine spotting and as trainers throughout the rest of the conflict. In spite of the type's rather unresponsive controls, it was capable of executing comprehensive (if somewhat stately) aerobatics, and was by no means a bad trainer.Lewis, Cecil. (Chapter II, The Somme), Corgi Edition, 1936, pp. 38‚Äì40. On 19 February 1917, a B.E.2c was used to conduct the British Army's first aeromedical evacuation when it flew out the sole casualty of the raid on Bir el Hassana in the Sinai Peninsula. The man had a shattered ankle, and the 45-minute flight in the observer's seat spared him an agonizing multi-day journey by camel.Dolev (1986), Vol. 132, pp. 34‚Äì36. A B.E.2c at the Imperial War Museum in London. =Post-war use= A B.E.2e was used to conduct the first flight across Australia, flying from Melbourne to Port Darwin. It was piloted by Captain H. N. Wrigley, accompanied by Sergeant A. W. Murphy. The journey, made between 16 November and 12 December 1919, involved a combined 46 hours of flying time.\\"Side-winds.\\" Flight, Volume XII, No. 577, 15 January 1920, p. 88.

It is commonly seen in the aquarium trade. Appearance This fish is of roughly tetragonal shape, light grey in coloring, with a black patch, surrounded by iridescent silver edging, posterior of the gills on each side. The male's fins are black, as is the female's dorsal fin; the female's pelvic, anal, and adipose fins are reddish in color. A long-finned variety, apparently developed by captive breeders, is sometimes sold in the aquarium trade (the male has elongated dorsal and anal fins even in the wild form). The black phantom tetra reaches a maximum standard length of . = Sex = A female black phantom tetra identified by its reddish pelvic, anal and adipose fins The male black phantom tetras have longer fins than the females and when in breeding condition, the females become plumper, but the biggest difference is in their color. The males have no red, while the smaller fins of the female both on the top and underneath them are red. The adipose fin, on the top of the body behind the larger dorsal fin, is much more noticeable in the females than the males, because in females it is red while in the males it is grey. The female's dorsal fin has a more intense black than the male's. When the fish are in breeding condition, the colors of both sexes become more distinct, with the male showing its black fins more obviously. Feeding The black phantom tetra's natural diet consist of small crustaceans, insects, and worms. In the aquarium H. megalopterus is one of the more popular tetras sold in the aquarium trade. While it is not particularly colorful, it makes up for this by its display behavior: the males are territorial and defend their space against their neighbors by presenting themselves in profile with the dorsal and anal fins fully extended, and the dark color intensified, making the edging of the body patch stand out prominently. Sometimes they exchange blows which can tear the fins, but this damage heals quickly. Unlike other tetras who prefer to live in large shoals, they will also do fine when kept in a group of four or five individuals, making them suitable for smaller aquaria. There should still be enough space for the males to stake territories and present themselves to best effort, however. Male Black Phantom Tetra with fins fully extended =Breeding= The fish should be well conditioned to induce spawning. When possible, live foods are included in the conditioning period. Frozen foods like bloodworms are also used as conditioning food. The Black phantom tetra is an egg-scattering species. To stimulate breeding, pH is lowered to about 5.5-6, the general hardness of the water is also reduced below four degrees. The breeding tank should have plants, both rooted and floating, and low light. A female black phantom tetra will produce about 300 eggs. These fish will eat their own eggs and fry, so the parents are usually removed after spawning. =Raising the fry= The babies are fed infusoria (protozoa) at first. Commercial fry foods of suitable sizes can be used but at all stages the young fish benefit from live food of the right size.

Previously, he was the bassist for A Perfect Circle and a touring member of Nine Inch Nails, and is currently the vocalist for Goon Moon. He left Marilyn Manson in 2002, later rejoined the band in 2008, and was dismissed in 2017. He has been a principal songwriter for the band and has also contributed to some of the Desert Sessions recordings. He also hosts the Hour of Goon podcast with fellow musician Fred Sablan, on the Feral Audio network. Early life Born in Pompton Lakes, New Jersey, he moved to Florida during his childhood.Staff. \\"De-Tour Hole Has Left, Monster Magnet Is Missing, But Marilyn Manson Rolls On\\", Fort Wayne News Sentinel, April 15, 1999. Accessed September 13, 2018. \\"Twiggy a 26-year-old native of Pompton Lakes, NJ, real name Jeordie White, says he had a normal childhood for a divorced kid before relocating to Fort Lauderdale.\\" He has an older brother, James. He did not know his father for most of his life but united with him in 2008 (which was mentioned in the Love Line radio interview in 2008). Influenced by the likes of M√∂tley Cr√ºe, Van Halen and Iron Maiden, he first picked up a guitar at age thirteen. Although a New Jersey native, he spent the better portion of his youth in the Fort Lauderdale area, where he quickly embraced South Florida's growing music scene and, by age 15, had joined his first band, The Ethiopians. Musical career Early in his career, White was in a speed metal cover band called The Ethiopians covering songs such as Metallica's \\"Trapped Under Ice\\". Between 1989 and 1993, White played rhythm guitar and provided backing vocals for Amboog-a-Lard. =(1993‚Äì2002;2008‚Äì2017) Marilyn Manson= White met Brian Warner on numerous occasions in the late 1980s. After an unexpected meeting at a used records store in the Coral Springs Mall where White was working, the two realized they had much in common, but had yet to work on a musical endeavor. White actively attempted to join Manson's band while playing in another project. Video, TV-14, 1:19. He became an honorary spooky kid, and went by the groupie name Gordy White. In March 1993, White took part in Manson's side project Mrs. Scabtree and shared vocal duties with then girlfriend Jessicka. Jeordie did not join Marilyn Manson and the Spooky Kids until Gidget Gein was ejected from the band by the manager in December 1993. White was given the Manson band member name Twiggy Ramirez, which was derived by taking the first name from English supermodel Twiggy and the surname from American serial killer Richard Ramirez. White never played bass until Manson bought him his first instrument right after he joined Manson's band. In 1998, White made a cameo in Monster Magnet's music video for \\"Space Lord\\". In 2001, White appeared on an MTV Cribs episode: the \\"Ozzfest Edition\\". As a result of many lineup changes (specifically guitarists), White was largely responsible for most of the songwriting on the albums Antichrist Superstar, Mechanical Animals and Holy Wood; for the latter album, he shared credits with John 5. In 2007, White said that he is proud of the work that he did in the band. On January 9, 2008 Marilyn Manson posted a bulletin on MySpace confirming that Tim Skold was leaving Marilyn Manson and that White had rejoined the band in his place. He toured with Manson as the band's new guitarist in support of their seventh studio album. However, he stayed with Goon Moon after the touring of The High End of Low finished. White also mentioned in an interview that he would keep working with Manson for their next album, Born Villain, which was released on May 1, 2012. While he didn't participate in the writing or recording of Marilyn Manson's 2015 album, The Pale Emperor, he continued to tour with the band. Manson confirmed on Reddit that he intends on collaborating with White for the follow-up to The Pale Emperor. Despite this, the band's latest album, Heaven Upside Down, features no contributions from White. On October 24, 2017 Marilyn Manson posted on Facebook that the band parted ways with White following allegations of sexual misconduct made against him, and announced that there will be a replacement for the upcoming tour. =(2003‚Äìpresent) Other projects= After departing Marilyn Manson, White played two live shows with California punk metal band Mondo Generator, and auditioned for the role of second guitar in Queens of the Stone Age, which he lost to Troy Van Leeuwen of A Perfect Circle. He also auditioned for a spot as bass player (after Jason Newsted's departure) in Metallica, but lost out to former Suicidal Tendencies/Ozzy Osbourne bassist Robert Trujillo, which is documented briefly in their film, Metallica: Some Kind of Monster. Several months later, White replaced Paz Lenchantin in A Perfect Circle, the project of Tool frontman Maynard James Keenan and former Tool guitar tech Billy Howerdel as a full member of the band on bass guitar. White later joined Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme on the ninth and tenth volumes of Homme's music project The Desert Sessions. He contributed to Melissa Auf der Maur's solo debut and second solo album Out of Our Minds. He toured with Nine Inch Nails in support of their album With Teeth, from 2005‚Äì06 and then again in 2007 for Year Zero. White has composed for a range of artists from fictional band Steel Dragon to Bif Naked to his namesake, model Twiggy Lawson with whom he recorded and produced a duet of Dusty Springfield's \\"I Only Want To Be With You\\" for the soundtrack of the MTV film Dead Man on Campus. In 2005, White worked with Goon Moon and with them released the EP I Got a Brand New Egg Layin' Machine, recorded at Rancho De La Luna, Prescription and Regime Studios. The band released their first full-length album \\"Licker's Last Leg\\" in May 2007. White appeared on the UNKLE album War Stories playing bass and synths on the track \\"Burn My Shadow\\". ' White was invited to return to play with A Perfect Circle for their Fall and Winter 2010 Tour in North America, but ultimately did not participate in the reunion and was permanently replaced by Matt McJunkins. Personal life White cites Oasis, The Who, The Kinks and the Bee Gees as his influences and as his favorite bands. White has a Don't Believe the Truth tattoo as a tribute to Oasis on his left arm. Due to his friendship with Oasis producer Dave Sardy, White got to play bass on a new version of Oasis' \\"Cast No Shadow\\" that was submitted to the soundtrack for the 2005 movie Goal!, and contributed remixes of \\"I'm Outta Time\\" and \\"Falling Down\\" that the band used as b-sides. It has been emphasized by White personally that if there was one single piece of information the public should know about him it would be that he smells like baby powder. =Rape accusation= On October 21, 2017, White's ex-girlfriend Jessicka Addams, lead singer of the band Jack Off Jill, published a Facebook post accusing White of rape, as well as physical and emotional abuse throughout their five year relationship, from 1992 to 1997. White issued a statement following the allegations: \\"I have only recently been made aware of these allegations from over 20 years ago. I do not condone non- consensual sex of any kind. I will be taking some time to spend with my family and focus on maintaining my several years of sobriety. If I have caused anyone pain I apologize and truly regret it.\\" Preferred equipment \\"Twiggy Ramirez\\" performing on the \\"Dead to the World Tour\\" in Argentina, August 6, 1997 with Marilyn Manson While in Marilyn Manson, White used the following bass guitars, among many things, showing a strong preference for Gibson instruments, and bass guitars used by his classic rock mentors: *White owns multiple Gibson Thunderbird bass guitars.

They were carved on stone or metal and presented in message boards in public places like the Forum of Rome. They were also called simply Acta. In many ways, they functioned like an early newspaper for the Roman citizenry. The Acta were begun in 59 BC and continued until AD 222. History Acta Diurna, also called Acta Populi, Acta Publica and simply Acta or Diurna, in ancient Rome was a sort of daily government gazette, containing an officially authorized narrative of noteworthy events at Rome. Its contents were partly official (court news, decrees of the Roman emperor, Roman Senate and Roman magistrates), partly private (notices of births, marriages and deaths). Thus to some extent it filled the place of the modern newspaper. The origin of the Acta is attributed to Julius Caesar, who first ordered the keeping and publishing of the acts of the people by public officers (59 B.C.; Suetonius, Caesar, 20). The Acta were drawn up from day to day, and exposed in a public place on a whitened board called an Album. After remaining there for a reasonable time they were taken down and preserved with other public documents, so that they might be available for purposes of research. The Acta differed from the Annals (which were discontinued in 133 B.C.) in that only the greater and more important matters were given in the latter, while in the former things of less note were recorded. Their publication continued till the transference of the seat of the empire to Constantinople. There are no genuine fragments extant. Sometimes scribes made copies of the Acta and sent them to governors for information. Later emperors used them to announce royal or senatorial decrees and events of the court. Other forms of Acta were legal, municipal and military notices. Acta Diurna introduced the expression ‚Äúpublicare et propagare‚Äù, which means \\"make public and propagate.\\" This expression was set in the end of the texts and proclaimed a release to both Roman citizens and non-citizens. Legacy Today, there are many academic periodicals with the word acta in their titles (the publisher Elsevier has 64 such titles). Acta Diurna was also used as the title of a Latin newspaper, published by Centaur Books.  References   External links  * Brian J.

The siege marked the height of the struggle between the Catholics and the Protestants in France, and ended with a complete victory for King Louis XIII and the Catholics. Background Huguenots areas of France (marked purple and blue) The 1598 Edict of Nantes that ended the French Wars of Religion granted Protestants, commonly known as Huguenots, a large degree of autonomy and self- rule. La Rochelle was the centre of Huguenot seapower, and a key point of resistance against the Catholic royal government. The assassination of Henry IV of France in 1610 led to the appointment of Marie de' Medici as regent for her nine-year-old son, Louis XIII. Her removal in 1617 caused a series of revolts by powerful regional nobles, both Catholic and Protestant, while religious tensions were heightened by the outbreak of the 1618 to 1648 Thirty Years War. In 1621, Louis re-established Catholicism in the formerly Huguenot region of B√©arn, resulting in an uprising led by Henri de Rohan and his brother Soubise. Despite the Royalist capture of Saint-Jean d'Ang√©ly, a blockade of La Rochelle was unsuccessful and the revolt ended in stalemate with the October 1622 Treaty of Montpellier. Taking La Rochelle was a priority for Louis and his chief minister Cardinal Richelieu; it was then the second- or third-largest city in France, with over 30,000 inhabitants, and one of its most important ports. In addition to the customs duties generated by imports, it was also among the biggest producers of salt, a major source of taxes for the state; this made it economically crucial. Defeating Rohan and taking possession of La Rochelle were both essential for Richelieu's policy of centralisation, but since the French Crown did not have a navy strong enough to capture it, he asked England for help. When James I refused, he approached the Dutch Republic. The Huguenots were supported by Spain, who the Protestant Dutch were then fighting for their independence; in return for French subsidies, they agreed to provide naval backing in the 1624 Treaty of Compi√®gne. English intervention Duke of Buckingham attempted to lift the siege. The Anglo-French conflict followed the failure of their alliance of 1624, in which England had tried to find an ally in France against the power of the Habsburgs. In 1626, France under Richelieu concluded a secret peace with Spain, and disputes arose around Henrietta Maria's household. Furthermore, France was building the power of its Navy, leading the English to be convinced that France must be opposed \\"for reasons of state\\".Historical dictionary of Stuart England, 1603-1689 by Ronald H. Fritze, p.203 In June 1626, Walter Montagu was sent to France to contact dissident noblemen, and from March 1627 attempted to organize a French rebellion. The plan was to send an English fleet to encourage rebellion, triggering a new Huguenot revolt by Duke Henri de Rohan and his brother Soubise. =First La Rochelle expedition= On the first expedition, the English king Charles I sent a fleet of 80 ships, under his favourite George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, to encourage a major rebellion in La Rochelle. In June 1627, Buckingham organised a landing on the nearby island of √éle de R√© with 6,000 men in order to help the Huguenots, thus starting the Anglo-French War of 1627, with the objectives being to control the approaches to La Rochelle and to encourage the rebellion in the city. The city of La Rochelle initially refused to declare itself an ally of Buckingham against the crown of France and effectively denied access to its harbour to Buckingham's fleet. An open alliance would be declared only in September, during the first fights between La Rochelle and royal troops. Although it was a Protestant stronghold, √éle de R√© had not directly joined the rebellion against the king. On √éle de R√©, the English under Buckingham tried to take the fortified city of Saint-Martin in the Siege of Saint-Martin-de-R√© (1627) but were repulsed after three months. Small French royal boats managed to supply St Martin in spite of the English blockade. Buckingham ultimately ran out of money and support, and his army was weakened by disease. After a last attack on Saint-Martin, they were repulsed with heavy casualties and left with their ships. Siege La Rochelle during the siege.

Construction of a Royal fort in the area of Les Minimes. Meanwhile, in August 1627 French royal forces started to surround La Rochelle, with an army of 7,000 soldiers, 600 horses and 24 cannons, led by Charles of Angoul√™me. They started to reinforce fortifications at Bongraine (modern Les Minimes), and at the Fort Louis. On September 10, the first cannon shots were fired by La Rochelle against royal troops at Fort Louis, starting the third Huguenot rebellion. La Rochelle was the greatest stronghold among the Huguenot cities of France, and the centre of Huguenot resistance. Cardinal Richelieu acted as commander of the besiegers when the King was absent. Once hostilities started, French engineers isolated the city with entrenchments long, fortified by 11 forts and 18 redoubts. The surrounding fortifications were completed in April 1628, manned with an army of 30,000. Four thousand workmen also built a long seawall to block the seaward access between the city and harbor, stopping all supplies. The initial idea for blocking the channel came from the Italian engineer Pompeo Targone, but his structure was broken by winter weather, before the idea was taken up by the royal architect Cl√©ment M√©tezeau in November 1627. The wall was built on a foundation of sunken hulks filled with rubble. French artillery battered English ships trying to supply the city. Meanwhile, in southern France, Henri de Rohan vainly attempted to raise a rebellion to relieve La Rochelle. Until February, some ships were able to go through the seawall under construction, but after March this became impossible. The city was completely blockaded, with the only hope coming from possible intervention by an English fleet. =Foreign support for the French Crown= Louis XIII at the Siege of La Rochelle. Dutch support The Roman Catholic government of France rented ships from the Protestant city of Amsterdam to conquer the Protestant city of La Rochelle. This resulted in a debate in the city council of Amsterdam as to whether the French soldiers should be allowed to have a Roman Catholic sermon on board of the Protestant Dutch ships. The result of the debate was that it was not allowed. The Dutch ships transported the French soldiers to La Rochelle. France was a Dutch ally in the war against the Habsburgs. Spanish alliance In the occasion of the Siege of La Rochelle, Spain manoeuvered towards the formation of a Franco-Spanish alliance against the common enemies that were the English, the Huguenots and the Dutch.The Thirty Years' War by Geoffrey Parker, p.74 Richelieu accepted Spanish help, and a Spanish fleet of 30 to 40 warships was sent from Cadiz to the Gulf of Morbihan as an affirmation of strategic support, arriving three weeks after the departure of Buckingham from √éle de R√©. At one point, the Spanish fleet anchored in front of La Rochelle, but did not engage in actual operations against the city. =English relief efforts= England attempted to send two more fleets to relieve La Rochelle. Second La Rochelle expedition A naval force led by William Feilding, Earl of Denbigh, left on April 1628, but returned without a fight to Portsmouth, as Denbigh said that he had no commission to hazard the king's ships in a fight, and returned shamefully to Portsmouth.An apprenticeship in arms by Roger Burrow Manning, p.119 Third La Rochelle expedition A third fleet was dispatched under the Admiral of the Fleet, the Earl of Lindsey in August 1628, consisting of 29 warships and 31 merchantmen.Ships, money, and politics by Kenneth R. Andrews, p.150 In September 1628, the English fleet tried to relieve the city. After bombarding French positions and failing to force the sea wall, the English fleet had to withdraw. Following this last disappointment, the city surrendered on 28 October 1628. Epilogue Jean Guitton and the defenders vowing to defend La Rochelle to the death. The surrender of La Rochelle, 17th century. Entrance of Louis XIII in La Rochelle, by Pierre Courtilleau. Residents of La Rochelle had resisted for 14 months, under the leadership of the mayor Jean Guitton and with gradually diminishing help from England. During the siege, the population of La Rochelle decreased from 27,000 to 5,000 due to casualties, famine, and disease. Surrender was unconditional. By the terms of the Peace of Alais, the Huguenots lost their territorial, political and military rights, but retained the religious freedom granted by the Edict of Nantes. However, they were left at the mercy of the monarchy, unable to resist later when Louis XIV abolished the Edict of Nantes altogether and embarked on active persecution. Aside from its religious aspect, the Siege of La Rochelle marks an important success in the creation of a strong central government of France, in control throughout its territory and able to suppress regional defiance. In the immediate aftermath was the growth of the absolute monarchy, but it had long-term effects upon all later French regimes up to the present. The French philosopher Descartes is known to have visited the scene of the siege in 1627. The siege was depicted in detail by numerous artists, such as Jacques Callot. =Birdeye views by Jacques Callot= File:Siege de la Rochelle par louis XIII et Richelieu du 10 aout 1627 au 28 octobre 1628 planche 1 Jacques Callot 1592 1635.jpgThe Siege of La Rochelle, plate 1.

In popular culture The siege forms the historical background for the novel The Three Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas, p√®re and the book's numerous adaptations to stage, screen, comics and video game. The 11th book of Robert Merle's Fortune de France series, La Gloire et les perils, deals entirely with the siege. In Lawrence Norfolk's 1991 novel, Lempri√®re's Dictionary, the siege is the central cause of events (entirely fictional) 160 years later in London around the writing of John Lempri√®re's Classical Dictionary containing a full Account of all the Proper Names mentioned in Ancient Authors. Taylor Caldwell writes about the siege in great detail in her 1943 novel The Arm and the Darkness but has as its commander the fictional Huguenot nobleman Arsene de Richepin, one of the central characters of the book.

Early life  Jean-Claude Romand was born in Lons-le-Saunier and grew up in the village Clairvaux-les-Lacs in the d√©partement of Jura. He studied at the lyc√©e of Lons-le-Saunier until his baccalaur√©at. In 1971, he registered at the classes pr√©paratoires of Lyc√©e du Parc in Lyon, but dropped out after one term. Afterwards he enrolled as a medical student.  Deception  The deception began with a simple lie: Romand claimed that he had passed a second-year medical examination that he did not take. He therefore never qualified as a doctor, a fact unknown to his parents. Romand fooled his family and friends for 18 years; they thought he was a successful medical professional and researcher in the World Health Organization (WHO). He managed to give an impression that he had researched arteriosclerosis and that he had contacts with political figures. In reality, he spent his days wandering and used the free information services of the local WHO building. He lived close by in Pr√©vessin-Mo√´ns, France. Periodically he left for a supposed work trip but only traveled to Geneva International Airport and spent a couple of days in a hotel room there, studying medical journals and a travel guide about the various countries he lied about visiting. Romand lived off the money his wife and he had made by selling an apartment, from his wife's salary, and from sums of money which were given to him by various relatives, who relied on his assurances that he was investing the money in various imaginary hedge funds and foreign ventures.Le Roman d'un menteur, France 2 documentary, 1999  Actions on the night of the murders  On 9 January 1993 Romand withdrew 2000 francs and borrowed a .22 long rifle from his father for which he purchased a suppressor, and gas canisters, and asked for them to be gift wrapped. That night, he beat his wife to death on the couple's double bed with a rolling pin. He left her body until the morning, sleeping as normal. The next morning, he woke his children, had breakfast, and watched cartoons. He put them to bed that night, and once they had fallen asleep, shot them both in the head. After these killings, the only people who could expose him were his parents and his ex-mistress, who wanted back 900,000 francs that she had given him as a favour. The next morning, Romand travelled to his parents' house, where he joined them for a meal. Immediately after the meal he repeatedly shot both of them and the family dog. That night he picked up his ex-mistress, telling her they were invited to a dinner with the then health minister, Bernard Kouchner. Pretending that they were lost, he made her exit the car, and as she did so he attempted to strangle her with a cord and sprayed tear gas into her face. After she fought back, he apologized and drove her back to her home, after making her promise to never tell anyone about his attempt to murder her. He then returned to his family home, which still contained the bodies of his dead wife and children. He sat and watched television before he poured petrol around the house, set it on fire, and took an overdose of sleeping pills to create the appearance of an intended suicide. Whether this attempt was genuine is doubtful, since the pills he took were long expired, and he had access to more effective barbiturates; additionally, the manner in which the fire was set and the timing of his taking the pills made his rescue inevitable.L'Adversaire (The Adversary), Emmanuel Carr√®re book, 2000 He was rescued by local firefighters who were alerted by the road cleaners at 4:00 the next morning. He survived the blaze, but refused to talk to police during subsequent questioning. Aftermath Romand's trial began on 25 June 1996. On 6 July 1996 Romand was sentenced to life imprisonment with no possibility of parole for 22 years; he became eligible for parole in 2015. The appeals court in Bourges granted Romand a parole in 2019 after being imprisoned for 26 years. Romand is reputed to suffer from narcissistic personality disorder.  Documentary and fiction  French author Emmanuel Carr√®re entered into correspondence with imprisoned Romand to write a book, published in 2000, L'Adversaire (The Adversary), based on the case. Nicole Garcia directed a movie, L'Adversaire (2002), based on the book; actor Daniel Auteuil played the part of Romand (renamed Jean-Marc Faure in the film). Two other movies were loosely based on Romand's life: the French L'Emploi du temps (2001) (English title: Time Out) and the Spanish ' (English title: Nobody's Life). Romand's deception also formed the basis of the \\"Subterraneans\\" episode of the BBC crime drama Waking The Dead (third episode of the fifth season in 2005). The episode 16 (season 1) \\"Phantom\\" of Law & Order: Criminal Intent is also constructed around this story.

(17 October 1253 ‚Äì 19 May 1303), also known Yvo, Yves, or Ives (and in Breton as Erwan, Iwan, Youenn or Eozenn, depending on the region, and known as Yves H√©lory (also Helori or Heloury) in French), was a parish priest among the poor of Louannec, the only one of his station to be canonized in the Middle Ages. He is the patron of Brittany, lawyers and abandoned children. His feast day is 19 May. Poetically, he is referred to as \\"Advocate of the Poor\\". Life Born at Kermartin, a manor near Tr√©guier in Brittany, on 17 October 1253, Ivo was the son of Helori, lord of Kermartin, and Azo du Kenquis. In 1267 Ivo was sent to the University of Paris, where he graduated in civil law. While other students partied, Ivo studied, prayed and visited the sick. He also refused to eat meat or drink wine. Among his fellow- students were the scholars Duns Scotus and Roger Bacon. He went to Orl√©ans in 1277 to study canon law under Peter de la Chapelle, a famous journalist who later became bishop of Toulouse and a cardinal.Staley, Tony. \\"Good as lawyer, judge and priest\\", The Compass News, Catholic Diocese of Green Bay, Wisconsin, 13 May 2013 Landscape with the preaching of Saint Ivo, by Lucas van Uden On his return to Brittany, having received minor orders he was appointed an \\"official\\", the title given to an ecclesiastical judge, of the archdeanery of Rennes (1280). He protected orphans and widows, defended the poor, and rendered fair and impartial verdicts. It‚Äôs said that even those on the losing side respected his decisions. Ivo also represented the helpless in other courts, paid their expenses and visited them in prison. He earned the title ‚ÄúAdvocate of the Poor.‚Äù Although it was common to give judges ‚Äúgifts,‚Äù Ivo refused bribes. He often helped many disputing parties settle out of court so they could save money. Meanwhile, he studied Scripture, and there are strong reasons for believing the tradition held among Franciscans that he joined the Third Order of St. Francis sometime later at Guingamp. Ivo was ordained to the priesthood in 1284. He continued to practice law and once, when a mother and son couldn‚Äôt resolve many of their differences, he offered a Mass for them. They immediately reached a settlement. Ivo was soon invited by the Bishop of Tr√©guier to become his official, and accepted the offer in 1284. He displayed great zeal and rectitude in the discharge of his duty and did not hesitate to resist taxation by the king, which he considered an encroachment on the rights of the Church. Due to his charity he gained the title of advocate and patron of the poor. Having been ordained he was appointed to the parish of Tredrez in 1285 and eight years later to Louannec, where he died of natural causes after a life of hard work and repeated fasting. The Widow of Tours St Ivo Giving Alms to the Poor by Josse van der Baren John Wigmore retells the famous story of St. Ives and the Widow of Tours, writing in the Fordham Law Review in 1936: :Tours was near Orleans; the bishop held his court there; and Ivo, while visiting the court, lodged with a certain widow. One day he found his widow- landlady in tears. Her tale was that next day she must go to court to answer to the suit of a traveling merchant who had tricked her. It seemed that two of them, Doe and Roe, lodging with her, had left in her charge a casket of valuables, while they went off on their business, but with the strict injunction that she was to deliver it up again only to the two of them jointly demanding it. That day, Doe had come back, and called for the casket, saying that his partner Roe was detained elsewhere. She in good faith in his story had delivered the casket to Doe, but then later came Roe demanding it, charging his partner with wronging him, and holding the widow responsible for delivering up the casket to Doe contrary to the terms of their directions. She stated if she had to pay for those valuables it would ruin her. \\"Have no fear,\\" said young Ivo, \\"You should indeed have waited for the two men to appear together, but I will go to court tomorrow, for you, and will save you from ruin.\\" So when the case was called before the Judge, and the merchant Roe charged the widow with breach of faith, \\"Not so,\\" pleaded Ivo, \\"My client need not yet make answer to this claim. The plaintiff has not proved his case. The terms of the bailment were that the casket should be demanded by the two merchants coming together, but here is only one of them making the demand. \\"Where is the other? Let the plaintiff produce his partner.\\" The judge promptly approved his plea, whereupon the merchant, required to produce his fellow, turned pale, fell a-trembling, and would have retired. The judge, suspecting something from his plight, ordered him to be arrested and questioned; the other merchant was also traced and brought in, and the casket was recovered; which, when opened, was found to contain nothing but old junk. In short, the two rascals had conspired to plant the casket with the widow, and then to coerce her to pay them the value of the alleged contents. Thus the young advocate saved the widow from ruin. :The fame of this clever defense of the widow soon went far and wide.... Legacy Tugdual in a procession at the gate of Tr√©guier's cathedral in 2005. In the reliquary is the skull of Saint Ivo On the occasion of the 700th anniversary of the birth of St. Ivo, Pope John Paul II said, \\"The values proposed by St Ivo retain an astonishing timeliness. His concern to promote impartial justice and to defend the rights of the poorest persons invites the builders of Europe today to make every effort to ensure that the rights of all, especially the weakest, are recognized and defended.\\" Saint Yves is the patron of lawyers. As a result, many law schools and association of catholic lawyers have taken his names. For instance, the Society of St. Yves in Jerusalem (a Catholic Center for Human Rights and Legal Aid, Resources and Development), the Conf√©rence Saint Yves in Luxembourg (the Luxembourg Catholic Lawyers Association), or the Association de la Saint Yves Lyonnais. Veneration He was buried in Minihy-Tr√©guier in the church he founded. There is a tomb of his in the cathedral in Tr√©guier where it was supposedly inscribed in Latin: Relic skull and reliquary of St. Ivo in Tr√©guier, Brittany, France Ivo was canonized in June 1347 by Clement VI at the urging of Philip I, Duke of Burgundy. At the inquest into his sanctity in 1331, many of his parishioners testified as to his goodness, that he preached regularly in both chapel and field, and that under him \\"the people of the land became twice as good as they had been before\\". The connection between religion and good behaviour was especially stressed in his sermons and he is reported to have \\"chased immorality and sin from the village of Louannec\\". Shortly after 1362, the future saint Jeanne-Marie de Maill√© reported a vision of Yves (and an ecstasy, raptus), during which he told her, \\"If you are willing to abandon the world, you will taste here on earth the joys of heaven.\\" Ivo is often represented with a purse in his right hand (for all the money he gave to the poor during his life) and a rolled paper in the other hand (for his charge as a judge). Another popular representation of Ivo is between a rich man and a poor one. The churches of Sant'Ivo alla Sapienza and Sant'Ivo dei Bretoni in Rome are dedicated to him.

In 1898 she moved to Worpswede and learned sculpture with Fritz Mackensen. She befriended Paula Becker (later Modersohn-Becker) a painter there.

A commodity at its most basic, according to Arjun Appadurai, is \\"anything intended for exchange,\\" or any object of economic value.For the quote, Arjun Appadurai, \\"Definitions: Commodity and Commodification,\\" in Martha Ertman, Joan C.

Sharp, \\"The Commodification of the Body and Its Parts,\\" Annual Review of Anthropology, 29, 2000 (pp. 287‚Äì328) p. 295ff. Human commodity is a term used in case of human organ trade, paid surrogacy also known as commodification of the womb, and human trafficking. Slave trade as a form of human trafficking is a form of the commodification of people. According to G√∏sta Esping-Andersen people are commodified or 'turned into objects' when selling their labour on the market to an employer. Terminology The earliest use of the word commodification in English attested in the Oxford English Dictionary dates from 1975.commodification, n. Second edition, 1989; online version November 2010. ; accessed 6 January 2011. Use of the concept of commodification became common with the rise of critical discourse analysis in semiotics. Business and economics The word commodification, which describes assignment of economic value to something not previously considered in economic terms, is sometimes also used to describe the transformation of the market for a unique, branded product into a market based on undifferentiated products. These two concepts are fundamentally different and the business community more commonly uses commoditization to describe the transformation of the market to undifferentiated products through increased competition, typically resulting in decreasing prices. While in economic terms, commoditization is closely related to and often follows from the stage when a market changes from one of monopolistic competition to one of perfect competition, a product essentially becomes a commodity when customers perceive little or no value difference between brands or versions. Commoditization can be the desired outcome of an entity in the market, or it can be an unintentional outcome that no party actively sought to achieve. (For example, see Xerox#Trademark.) According to Neo-classical economic theory, consumers can benefit from commoditization, since perfect competition usually leads to lower prices. Branded producers often suffer under commoditization, since the value of the brand (and ability to command price premiums) can be weakened. However, false commoditization can create substantial risk when premier products do have substantial value to offer, particularly in health, safety and security. Examples are counterfeit drugs and generic network services (loss of 911). Commodification and commoditization The terms commodification and commoditization are sometimes used synonymously,Robert Hartwell Fiske‚Äôs Dictionary of Unendurable English: A Compendium of Mistakes in Grammar, Usage, and Spelling with commentary on lexicographers and linguists, Robert Hartwell Fiske, p. 99 particularly in the sense of this article, to describe the process of making commodities out of anything that was not used to be available for trade previously; compare anthropology usage.Appadurai 1986, also cited in Martha M. Ertman, Joan C. Williams, Rethinking commodification, 2005, in Afterword by Carol Rose, pp. 402‚Äì403. This cites various uses of commodification to mean \\"become a commodity market\\", and considers the use of commodification (Peggy Radin, 1987) and commoditization (Appadurai 1986) as equivalent. However, other authors distinguish them (as done in this article), with commodification used in social contexts to mean that a non-commercial good has become commercial, typically with connotations of \\"corrupted by commerce\\", while commoditization is used in business contexts to mean when the market for an existing product has become a commodity market, where products are interchangeable and there is heavy price competition. In a quip: \\"Microprocessors are commoditized. Love is commodified.\\" The difference between the terms of commodification (Marxist political theory) and commoditization (business theory) has been drawn by James Surowiecki (1998) and Douglas Rushkoff (2005). In particular, Rushkoff argued that the words commodification and commoditization were used to describe the two different processes of the assignment of value to a social good, and the movement towards undifferentiated competition, respectively: Commodification (beginning early 1950s) is used to describe the process by which something which does not have an economic value is assigned a value and hence how market values can replace other social values. It describes a modification of relationships, formerly untainted by commerce, into commercial relationships in everyday use. Commoditization (early 1990s in business theory) is the process by which goods that have economic value and are distinguishable in terms of attributes (uniqueness or brand) end up becoming simple commodities in the eyes of the market or consumers. It is the movement of a market from differentiated to undifferentiated price competition and from monopolistic to perfect competition.  Cultural commodification  American author and feminist bell hooks thinks about the cultural commodification of race and difference as the dominant culture \\"eating the other\\". To hooks, cultural expressions of Otherness, even revolutionary ones, are sold to the dominant culture for their enjoyment. And any messages of social change are not marketed for their messages but used as a mechanism for the dominant ones to acquire a piece of the \\"primitive\\".hooks, bell 1992. Black Looks: Race and Representation (South End Press) Any interests in past historical culture almost always have a modern twist. According to Mariana Torgovnick: > What is clear now is that the West's fascination with the primitive has to > do with its own crises in identity, with its own need to clearly demarcate > subject and object even while flirting with other ways of experiencing the > universe.Torgovnick, Marianna 1991. Gone Primitive: Savage Intellects, > Modern Lives (Chicago) hooks states that marginalized groups are seduced by this concept because of \\"the promise of recognition and reconciliation\\". > When the dominant culture demands that the Other be offered as sign that > progressive political change is taking place, that the American Dream can > indeed be inclusive of difference, it invites a resurgence of essentialist > cultural nationalism. Commodification of indigenous cultures refers to \\"areas in the life of a community which prior to its penetration by tourism have not been within the domain of economic relations regulated by criteria of market exchange‚Äù (Cohen 1988, 372). An example of this type of cultural commodification can be described through viewing the perspective of Hawaiian cultural change since the 1950s. A Hawaiian Luau, which was once a traditional performance reserved for community members and local people, but through the rise of tourism, this tradition has lost part of its cultural meaning and is now mostly a \\"for profit\\" performance. Digital commodification is when a business or corporation uses information from an online community without their knowledge for profit. The commodification of information allows a higher up authority to make money rather than a collaborative system of free thoughts. In Marxist theory The Marxist understanding of commodity is distinct from its meaning in business. Commodity played a key role throughout Karl Marx's work; he considered it a cell-form of capitalism and a key starting point for an analysis of this politico-economic system. Marx extensively criticized the social impact of commodification under the name commodity fetishism and alienation.

Such geodesics are called prime geodesics because, among other things, they obey an asymptotic distribution law similar to the prime number theorem. Technical background We briefly present some facts from hyperbolic geometry which are helpful in understanding prime geodesics. =Hyperbolic isometries= Consider the Poincar√© half-plane model H of 2-dimensional hyperbolic geometry. Given a Fuchsian group, that is, a discrete subgroup Œì of PSL(2, R), Œì acts on H via linear fractional transformation. Each element of PSL(2, R) in fact defines an isometry of H, so Œì is a group of isometries of H. There are then 3 types of transformation: hyperbolic, elliptic, and parabolic. (The loxodromic transformations are not present because we are working with real numbers.) Then an element Œ≥ of Œì has 2 distinct real fixed points if and only if Œ≥ is hyperbolic. See Classification of isometries and Fixed points of isometries for more details. =Closed geodesics= Now consider the quotient surface M=Œì\\\\H. The following description refers to the upper half-plane model of the hyperbolic plane. This is a hyperbolic surface, in fact, a Riemann surface. Each hyperbolic element h of Œì determines a closed geodesic of Œì\\\\H: first, by connecting the geodesic semicircle joining the fixed points of h, we get a geodesic on H called the axis of h, and by projecting this geodesic to M, we get a geodesic on Œì\\\\H. This geodesic is closed because 2 points which are in the same orbit under the action of Œì project to the same point on the quotient, by definition. It can be shown that this gives a 1-1 correspondence between closed geodesics on Œì\\\\H and hyperbolic conjugacy classes in Œì. The prime geodesics are then those geodesics that trace out their image exactly once -- algebraically, they correspond to primitive hyperbolic conjugacy classes, that is, conjugacy classes {Œ≥} such that Œ≥ cannot be written as a nontrivial power of another element of Œì. Applications of prime geodesics The importance of prime geodesics comes from their relationship to other branches of mathematics, especially dynamical systems, ergodic theory, and number theory, as well as Riemann surfaces themselves. These applications often overlap among several different research fields. =Dynamical systems and ergodic theory= In dynamical systems, the closed geodesics represent the periodic orbits of the geodesic flow. =Number theory= In number theory, various \\"prime geodesic theorems\\" have been proved which are very similar in spirit to the prime number theorem. To be specific, we let œÄ(x) denote the number of closed geodesics whose norm (a function related to length) is less than or equal to x; then œÄ(x) ‚àº x/ln(x). This result is usually credited to Atle Selberg. In his 1970 Ph.D. thesis, Grigory Margulis proved a similar result for surfaces of variable negative curvature, while in his 1980 Ph.D. thesis, Peter Sarnak proved an analogue of Chebotarev's density theorem. There are other similarities to number theory -- error estimates are improved upon, in much the same way that error estimates of the prime number theorem are improved upon. Also, there is a Selberg zeta function which is formally similar to the usual Riemann zeta function and shares many of its properties. Algebraically, prime geodesics can be lifted to higher surfaces in much the same way that prime ideals in the ring of integers of a number field can be split (factored) in a Galois extension. See Covering map and Splitting of prime ideals in Galois extensions for more details. =Riemann surface theory= Closed geodesics have been used to study Riemann surfaces; indeed, one of Riemann's original definitions of the genus of a surface was in terms of simple closed curves. Closed geodesics have been instrumental in studying the eigenvalues of Laplacian operators, arithmetic Fuchsian groups, and Teichm√ºller spaces.

It served during the mid-20th century in the United States Navy, the United States Marine Corps, and the air forces of other nations. It was Grumman Aircraft's last piston engined fighter aircraft. Modified versions of the Bearcat have broken speed records for piston-engined aircraft. Today, the Bearcat is popular among warbird owners and air racers. Design and development =Concept= The Bearcat concept began during a meeting between Battle of Midway veteran F4F Wildcat pilots and Grumman Vice President Jake Swirbul at Pearl Harbor on 23 June 1942. At the meeting, Lieutenant Commander Jimmie Thach emphasized one of the most important requirements in a good fighter plane was \\"climb rate\\".Ewing 2004, pp. 182, 308. Climb performance is strongly related to the power-to- weight ratio, and is maximized by wrapping the smallest and lightest possible airframe around the most powerful available engine. Another goal was that the G-58 (Grumman's design designation for the aircraft) should be able to operate from escort carriers, which were then limited to the obsolescent F4F Wildcat as the Grumman F6F Hellcat was too large and heavy. A small, lightweight aircraft would make this possible. After intensively analyzing carrier warfare in the Pacific Theater of Operations for a year and a half, Grumman began development of the G-58 Bearcat in late 1943. There is considerable debate among sources as to whether or not the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 influenced the design of the G-58. It is known that test pilots from Grumman examined and flew a captured Fw 190 in England in early 1943, and the G-58 has a number of design notes in common with the Fw 190 that the Hellcat did not, especially in the cowling and landing gear arrangements. However, no definitive evidence has been presented that these tests had a direct input to the G-58 design. =Design= F6F Hellcat (picture). In 1943, Grumman was in the process of introducing the F6F Hellcat, powered by the Pratt & Whitney R-2800 engine which provided . The R-2800 was the most powerful American engine available at that time, so it would be retained for the G-58. This meant that improved performance would have to come from a lighter airframe. To meet this goal, the Bearcat's fuselage was about shorter than the Hellcat, and was cut down vertically behind the cockpit area. This allowed the use of a bubble canopy, the first to be fitted to a US Navy fighter. The vertical stabilizer was the same height as the Hellcat's, but increased aspect ratio, giving it a thinner look. The wingspan was 7 feet less than the Hellcat's. Structurally the fuselage used flush riveting as well as spot welding, with a heavy gauge 302W aluminum alloy skin suitable for carrier landings. Armor protection was provided for the pilot, engine and oil cooler. The Hellcat used a 13 ft 1 in three-bladed Hamilton Standard propeller. A slight reduction in size was made by moving to a 12 ft 7 in Aeroproducts four-bladed propeller. Keeping the prop clear of the deck required long landing gear, which, combined with the shortened fuselage, gave the Bearcat a significant \\"nose-up\\" profile on land. The hydraulically operated undercarriage used an articulated trunnion which extended the length of the oleo legs when lowered; as the undercarriage retracted the legs were shortened, enabling them to fit into a wheel well which was entirely in the wing. An additional benefit of the inward retracting units was a wide track, which helped counter propeller torque on takeoff and gave the F8F good ground and carrier deck handling.Scrivner 1990, p. 4. The design team had set the goal that the G-58 should weigh 8,750 lb/3,969 kg fully loaded. As development continued it became clear this was impossible to achieve as the structure of the new fighter had to be made strong enough for aircraft carrier landings. Ultimately much of the weight-saving measures included restricting the internal fuel capacity to 160 gal (606 l) (later 183)Scrivner 1990, p. 7. and limiting the fixed armament to four .50 cal Browning M2/AN machine guns, two in each wing. The limited range due to the reduced fuel load would mean it would be useful in the interception role, but meant that the Hellcat would still be needed for longer range patrols. A later role was defending the fleet against airborne kamikaze attacks.\\"F8F Bearcat.\\" U.S. Naval Air Museum. Retrieved: 18 August 2010. Compared to the Hellcat, the Bearcat was 20% lighter, had a 30% better rate of climb and was 50 mph (80 km/h) faster.Swanborough and Bowers 1991, p. 241. Another weight-saving concept the designers came up with was detachable wingtips. The wings were designed to fold at a point about out along the span, reducing the space taken up on the carrier. Normally the hinge system would have to be built very strong in order to transmit loads from the outer portions of the wing to the main spar in the inner section, which adds considerable weight. Instead of building the entire wing to be able to withstand high-g loads, only the inner portion of the wing was able to do this. The outer portions were more lightly constructed, and designed to snap off at the hinge line if the g-force exceeded 7.5 g. In this case the aircraft would still be flyable and could be repaired after returning to the carrier. This saved of weight.Meyer, Corwin W. \\"Clipping the Bearcat's wing.\\" Flight Journal, August 1998, p. 1. Retrieved: 18 August 2010. NACA Langley Research Facility in 1945. =Prototypes= The design was completed in November 1943 and an order for two prototypes was placed on 27 November 1943 under the BuAir designation XF8F-1. The first prototype flew on 21 August 1944, only nine months after the design effort started.Gunston 1988, p. 48.Francillon 1989, p. 243. The initial flight test demonstrated a per minute climb rate and a top speed of . Compared to the Vought F4U Corsair, the Bearcat was marginally slower but more maneuverable and climbed more quickly. Testing demonstrated a number of problems, notably a lack of horizontal stability, an underpowered trim system, landing gear that could be extended only at slow speeds, an unreliable airspeed indicator, and a cramped cockpit. The test pilots also requested that six guns be installed. The stability problem was addressed on the second prototype by adding a triangular fillet to the front of the vertical stabilizer. The extra guns could not be incorporated due to weight and balance considerations. =Production= The Navy placed a production contract for 2,023 aircraft based on the second prototype on 6 October 1944. On 5 February 1945 they awarded another contract for 1,876 slightly modified aircraft from General Motors, given the designation F3M-1. These differed primarily in having the R-2800-34W engine and a small increase in fuel capacity. Deliveries from Grumman began on 21 May 1945. The end of the war led to the Grumman order being reduced to 770 examples, and the GM contract being cancelled outright. An additional order was placed for 126 F8F-1B's replacing the .50 cal machine guns with the 20 mm M2 cannon, the US version of the widely used Hispano-Suiza HS.404. Fifteen of these were later modified as F8F-1N night fighters with an APS-19 radar mounted under the starboard wing. An unmodified production F8F-1 set a 1946 time-to-climb record (after a run of 115 ft/35 m) of 10,000 ft (3,048 m) in 94 seconds (6,383 fpm). The Bearcat held this record for 10 years until it was broken by a jet fighter (which still could not match the Bearcat's short takeoff distance). In 1948 Grumman introduced a number of improvements to produce the F8F-2. Among the changes were a modified cowling design, taller vertical fin, and the slightly more powerful R-2800-30W engine producing . A total of 293 F8F-2s were produced, along with 12 F8F-2N night fighters and 60 F8F-2P reconnaissance versions. Production ended in 1949, and the first units began to convert off the type that year. The last Bearcats were withdrawn in 1952. Operational history On 25 August 1946, the Blue Angels converted to the Grumman F8F-1 Bearcat and introduced the famous \\"diamond\\" formation. A fully restored Bearcat in Blue Angels colors; seen at EAA AirVenture 2011 The F8F prototypes were ordered in November 1943 and first flew on 21 August 1944, a mere nine months later. The first production aircraft was delivered in February 1945 and the first squadron, Fighter Squadron 19 (VF-19), was operational by 21 May 1945, but World War II was over before the aircraft saw combat service. One problem that became evident in service was the snap-off wingtips not working as expected. While they worked well under carefully controlled conditions in flight and on the ground, in the field, where aircraft were repetitively stressed by landing on carriers and since the wings were slightly less carefully made in the factories, there was a possibility that only one wingtip would break away with the possibility of the aircraft crashing.Scrivner 1990, p. 14. This was replaced with an explosives system to blow the wingtips off together, which also worked well, but this ended when a ground technician died due to an accidental triggering. In the end, the wings were reinforced and the aircraft limited to 7.5 g. Postwar, the F8F became a major U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps fighter, equipping 24 fighter squadrons in the Navy and a smaller number in the Marines. Often mentioned as one of the best-handling piston-engine fighters ever built, its performance was sufficient to outperform many early jets. Its capability for aerobatic performance is illustrated by its selection as the second demonstration aircraft for the navy's elite Blue Angels flight demonstration squadron in 1946, replacing the Grumman F6F Hellcat. The Blue Angels flew the Bearcat until the team was temporarily disbanded in 1950 during the Korean War and pressed into operational combat service. The F9F Panther and McDonnell F2H Banshee largely replaced the Bearcat as their performance and other advantages eclipsed piston-engine fighters. =First combat= The first combat for the F8F Bearcat was during the French Indochina War (1946‚Äì1954) when nearly 200 Bearcats were delivered to the French forces in 1951. When the war ended in 1954, 28 surviving Bearcats were supplied to the Republic of Vietnam Air Force and entered service in 1956.Francillon 1989, pp. 252‚Äì253. The Vietnamese Bearcats were retired in 1960, replaced with Douglas A-1 Skyraiders and North American T-28 Trojans as the Vietnam War (1957‚Äì1975) continued.Grandolini, A. \\"Indo-Chinese fighting: 'Cats: Grumman's superb Bearcat in Vietnam.\\" Air Enthusiast, No. 70, July‚ÄìAugust 1997, pp. 12‚Äì21.

A stock Bearcat flown by Mira Slovak and sponsored by Bill Stead won the first Reno Air Race in 1964. Rare Bear, a highly modified F8F owned by Lyle Shelton, went on to dominate the event for decades, often competing with Daryl Greenamyer, another famous racer with victories in his own Bearcat (Conquest I, now at the Smithsonian's NASM) and holder of a piston-engined aircraft world speed record in it. Rare Bear also set many performance records, including the 3 km World Speed Record for piston-driven aircraft (528.33 mph/850.26 km/h), set in 1989, and a new time-to-climb record (3,000 m in 91.9 seconds (6,425.9 fpm), set in 1972, breaking the 1946 record cited above).\\"Lyle Shelton's \\"Rare Bear.\\" www.RareBear.com.

He is the leader of all the who dwell on the Sumeru's slopes. He is often portrayed with a yellow face. He carries an umbrella or parasol (chatra) as a symbol of his sovereignty. He is also sometimes displayed with a mongoose, often shown ejecting jewels from its mouth. The mongoose is the enemy of the snake, a symbol of greed or hatred; the ejection of jewels represents generosity.

Like other beings of the CƒÅtummahƒÅrƒÅjika world, his lifespan is 90,000 years (other sources say nine million years). has the authority to grant the yakkhas particular areas (e.g., a lake) to protect, and these are usually assigned at the beginning of a 's reign. When Gautama Buddha was born, became his follower, and eventually attained the stage of sotƒÅpanna, one who has only seven more lives before enlightenment. He often brought the Buddha and his followers messages from the gods and other humans, and protected them. He presented to the Buddha the verses, which Buddhists meditating in the forest could use to ward off the attacks of wild yakkhas or other supernatural beings who do not have faith in the Buddha.

Bishamon is portrayed holding a spear in one hand and a small pagoda in the other hand, the latter symbolizing the divine treasure house, whose contents he both guards and gives away. In Japanese folklore, he is one of the Seven Lucky Gods. Bishamon is also called Tamonten (Â§öËÅûÂ§© lit. \\"listening to many teachings\\") because he is seen as the guardian of the places where the Buddha preaches.

When shown seated, his right foot is generally pendant and supported by a lotus-flower on which is a conch shell. His mount is a snow lion.

Built in the mid-1970s as the main venue for the 1976 Summer Olympics, it is nicknamed \\"The Big O\\", a reference to both its name and to the doughnut-shape of the permanent component of the stadium's roof. The tower standing next to the stadium, The Montreal Tower, is the tallest inclined tower in the world with an angle elevation of 45 degrees. It is also called \\"The Big Owe\\" to reference the astronomical cost of the stadium and the 1976 Olympics as a whole. The stadium is the largest by seating capacity in Canada. After the Olympics, artificial turf was installed and it became the home of Montreal's professional baseball and football teams. The Montreal Alouettes of the CFL returned to their previous home of Molson Stadium in 1998 for regular season games, but continued to use Olympic Stadium for playoff and Grey Cup games until 2014 when they returned to Molson Stadium for all of their games. Following the 2004 baseball season, the Expos relocated to Washington, D.C., to become the Washington Nationals. The stadium currently serves as a multipurpose facility for special events (e.g. concerts, trade shows) with a permanent seating capacity of 56,040. The capacity is expandable with temporary seating. The Montreal Impact of Major League Soccer (MLS) use the venue on occasion, when demand for tickets justifies the large capacity or when the weather restricts outdoor play at nearby Saputo Stadium in the spring months. The stadium has not had a main tenant since the Expos left in 2004.

The stadium and Olympic Park grounds border Maisonneuve Park, which includes the Montreal Botanical Garden, adjacent to the west across Rue Sherbrooke (Route 138). History =Background and architecture= As early as 1963, Montreal Mayor Jean Drapeau sought to build a covered stadium in Montreal.Costello, Rory. Olympic Stadium (Montreal). Society for American Baseball Research, 2013. A covered stadium was thought to be all but essential for Drapeau's other goal of bringing a Major League Baseball team to Montreal, given the cold weather that can affect the city in April, October and sometimes even September. In 1967, soon after the National League granted Montreal an expansion franchise for 1969, Drapeau wrote a letter promising that any prospective Montreal team would be playing in a covered stadium by 1971. However, even as powerful as he was, he did not have the power to make such a guarantee on his own authority. Just as Charles Bronfman, who was slated to become the franchise's first owner, was ready to walk away, Drapeau had his staffers draw up a proposal for a stadium. It was enough to persuade Bronfman to continue with the effort. Tower with cables for retractable roof The stadium was designed by French architect Roger Taillibert to be an elaborate facility featuring a retractable roof, which was to be opened and closed by cables suspended from a huge tower ‚Äì the tallest inclined structure in the world, and the sixth tallest structure in Montreal. The design of the stadium resembles that of the Australian Pavilion at Expo '70 in Osaka, Japan. Soon after Montreal was awarded the 1976 Games, Drapeau struck a secret deal with Taillibert to build the stadium. It only came to light in 1972. The 1976 Montreal Olympic Swimming Pool on July 25, 2017 The Olympic swimming pool is located under this tower. An Olympic velodrome (since converted to the Montreal Biodome, an indoor nature museum) was situated at the base of the tower in a building similar in design to the swimming pool. The building was built as the main stadium for the 1976 Summer Olympic Games. The stadium was host to various events including the opening and closing ceremonies, athletics, football finals, and the team jumping equestrian events.1976 Summer Olympics official report. Volume 2. pp. 42‚Äì65. The building's design is cited as a masterpiece of Organic Modern architecture.R√©millard, 196. Taillibert based the building on plant and animal forms, aiming to include vertebral structures with sinews or tentacles, while still following the basic plans of Modern architecture. =Construction= Back view at night The stadium was originally slated to be finished in 1972, but the grand opening was cancelled due to a strike by construction workers. The Conseil des m√©tiers de la construction union headed by Andr√© \\"D√©d√©\\" Desjardins kept the construction site in \\"anarchic disorder\\" until the Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa bought him off in a secret deal. In his 2000 book Notre Cher Stade Olympique, Taillibert wrote \\"If the Olympic Games took place, it was thanks to D√©d√© Desjardins. What irony!\\" Further delays ensued due to the stadium's unusual design and Taillibert's unwillingness to back down from his original vision of the stadium even in the face of escalating costs for raw materials. It did not help that the original project manager, Trudeau et Associ√©s, seemed to be incapable of handling some of the most basic construction tasks. The Quebec provincial government finally lost patience with the delays and cost overruns in 1974, and threw Taillibert off the project. Additionally, the project was plagued by circumstances beyond anyone's control. Work slowed to a snail's pace for a third of the year due to Montreal's typically brutal winters. As a result, the stadium and tower remained unfinished at the opening of the 1976 Olympic Games. The roof materials languished in a warehouse in Marseille until 1982, and the tower and roof were not completed until 1987. It would be another year before the 66-tonne, Kevlar roof (designed and built by Lavalin) could retract. Even then, it could not be used in winds above . Ultimately, it was only opened and closed 88 times. =Observatory= North-east view from elevator lower deck compartment When construction on the stadium's tower resumed after the 1976 Olympics, a multi-storey observatory was added to the plan, accessible via an inclined elevator, opened in 1987, that travels along the curved tower's spine. The elevator cabin ascends from base of the tower to upper deck in less than two minutes at a rate of , with space for 76 persons per trip and a capacity of 500 persons per hour. The cabin is designed to remain level throughout its trip, while providing a panoramic view to its passengers. The elevator faces north-east, offering a view to the north, south and east. It overlooks the Olympic Village, the Biodome, the Botanical Gardens and Saputo Stadium. The Olympic Park, the stadium's suspended roof and downtown Montreal can be viewed from the south-west facing Observatory at the top of the tower. =Stadium financing= Aerial view at night Despite initial projections in 1970 that the stadium would cost only C$134 million to construct, strikes and construction delays served to escalate these costs. By the time the stadium opened (in an unfinished form), the total costs had risen to C$1.1 billion. The Quebec government introduced a special tobacco tax in May 1976 to help recoup its investment. By 2006, the amount contributed to the stadium's owner, the Olympic Installations Board (OIB) (fr: R√©gie des Installations Olympiques), accounted for 8% of the tax revenue earned from cigarette sales. The 1976 special tobacco tax act stipulated that once the stadium was paid off, ownership of the facility would be returned to the City of Montreal. In mid-November 2006, the stadium's costs were finally paid in full, more than 30 years after it opened. The total expenditure (including repairs, renovations, construction, interest, and inflation) amounted to C$1.61 billion, making it‚Äîat the time all costs were paid off‚Äîthe second most expensive stadium built (after Wembley Stadium in London). Despite initial plans to complete payment in October 2006, an indoor smoking ban introduced in May 2006 curtailed the revenue gathered by the tobacco tax. By 2014, the stadium's expense ranking had fallen to fifth, with the construction of costlier venues like MetLife Stadium, AT&T; Stadium, and the new Yankee Stadium. Perceived by many to be a white elephant, the stadium has also been dubbed The Big Owe due to its astronomical cost. The stadium has generated on average $20 million in revenue each year since 1977. It is estimated that a large-scale event such as the Grey Cup can generate as much as $50 million in revenue. =Continuing problems= Although the tower and retractable roof were not completed in time for the 1976 Olympics, construction on the tower resumed in the 1980s. During this period, however, a large fire set the tower ablaze, causing damage and forcing a scheduled Expos home game to be postponed. In 1986, a large chunk of the tower fell onto the playing field prior to another Expos game August 29 vs. San Diego Padres forcing a doubleheader on August 30. In January 1985, approval was given by the Quebec government to complete the project and install a retractable roof, financed by an Olympic cigarette tax in the province. The tower construction and installation of the orange-coloured Kevlar roof were completed by April 1987, a decade later than planned. The roof experienced numerous rips, allowing rain to leak into the stadium. As part of various renovations made in 1991 to improve the stadium's suitability as a baseball venue, 12,000 seats were eliminated, most of them in distant portions of the outfield, and home plate was moved closer to the stands. Olympic Stadium's blue roof and new scoreboard installed in 2015 On September 8 of that year, support beams snapped and caused a concrete slab to fall onto an exterior walkway. No one was injured, but the Expos had to move their final 13 home games of that season to the opponents' cities. The Expos hinted that the 1992 season was at risk unless the stadium was certified safe. In early November, engineers found the stadium was structurally sound. However, it took longer to certify the roof as safe because it had been badly ripped in a June windstorm. For the 1992 season, it was decided to keep the roof closed at all times. The Kevlar roof was removed in May 1998, making the stadium open-air for the 1998 season. Later in 1998, a $26 million non-retractable opaque blue roof was installed. In 1999, a portion of the roof collapsed on January 18, dumping ice and snow on workers that were setting up for the annual Montreal Auto Show. The auto show and a boat show the following month were canceled, and the auto show left the venue for good (since then, the Montreal Auto Show has usually been held at the Palais des congr√®s de Montr√©al). Repaired once again, the roof was modified to better withstand winter conditions: the OIB installed a network of pipes to circulate heated water under the roof to allow for snow melting. Despite these corrective measures, the stadium floor remained closed from December to March. Birdair, the fabric provider and designer of the roof, was later sued for the roof failure. The installer of the roof, Danny's Construction, having suffered tremendous cost overruns along with its subcontractor Montacier, due to changes in the plans and specifications and delays, was terminated during the construction, and Birdair completed the project. Danny's Construction sued Birdair in 1999. In February 2010, after a lengthy trial, the Quebec Superior Court awarded a judgement in favour of Danny's Construction and dismissed Birdair's countersuit.La Presse, Actualites, Samedi 13 Fevrier 2010, p. A9 The stadium's condition suffered considerably in the early 21st century. During the Expos' final years in Montreal, it was coated with grime, and much of the concrete was chipped, stained, and soiled. =Plans for a third roof= In 2009, the stadium received approval to remain open in the winter, provided weather conditions are favourable. However, the Olympic Installations Board issued a report stating that the roof was unsafe during heavy rainfall or more than of snow, and that it rips 50 to 60 times a year. The city fire department warned in August 2009 that without corrective measures, including a new roof, it may order the stadium closed. Events cannot be held if more than of snow are predicted 24 hours in advance, such as caused postponement of the Montreal Impact home opener soccer match in March 2014. A contract for a new permanent steel roof was awarded in 2004, with an estimated $300 million price tag. In June 2010, the Olympic Installations Board sought approval from the provincial government for the contract. In May 2011 a committee was formed to study the future of the stadium and improve the usage of the stadium, pool, and sports centre. A slab of concrete measuring approximately fell from the roof of the stadium's underground parking facility on March 4, 2012. There were no injuries. The roof continues to deteriorate, with 7,453 tears as of May 2017, limiting use of the venue in winter to when there are three or fewer centimetres of snow on the roof. In 2015, a new high definition scoreboard was installed, replacing the aging two-panel display dating back to the stadium's renovations in 1992. In November 2017 the Quebec government approved a new roof, estimated to cost $250 million. The Olympic Installations Board has estimated the cost of demolishing the stadium would be between $500 and $700 million, though this figure is based on a preliminary two-month study and thus has a high margin of error. The new roof would be removable, allowing the stadium to either be open-air or enclosed, consistent with the intent of the original roof. Post-Olympic use = Gridiron football= The Alouettes in action in 2010 The Canadian Football League's Montreal Alouettes became the stadium's first major post-Olympic tenant when they moved their home games there halfway through the 1976 season. Capacity was reduced from its Olympic capacity of 72,000 to 58,500, but leapt to 66,308 when the natural grass was replaced with AstroTurf ahead of the 1977 season. The Alouettes remained there through 1986, the franchise's final season of operations; the team would shut down shortly after the start of the 1987 season. A revived Alouettes franchise returned for the 1996 and 1997 seasons, but then moved to the Percival Molson Stadium in 1998, only using the larger Olympic Stadium for select regular- season and home playoff games. As of 2008, the franchise uses Olympic Stadium for playoff games only. Due to the increased popularity of the Alouettes and the small capacity of Percival Molson Stadium, the team considered returning to Olympic Stadium on a full-time basis, but instead renovated Percival Molson Stadium to increase its capacity. In addition, the stadium holds the record for the largest Grey Cup attendance, that of the 1977 Grey Cup game, in which the hometown Montreal Alouettes defeated the Edmonton Eskimos, 41-6 before 68,318 spectators; this despite a local transit strike and harsh winter weather conditions. Olympic Stadium has hosted the Grey Cup a total of six times, most recently in 2008 when the Calgary Stampeders defeated the hometown Alouettes. The stadium holds the record for nine of the ten largest crowds in CFL history, which include five regular-season and four Grey Cup games. A single-game record crowd numbering 69,083 attended a game played on September 6, 1977 between the Alouettes and Toronto Argonauts. In 1991 and 1992, the stadium was the home of the Montreal Machine of the World League of American Football. This included hosting World Bowl '92 on June 6, 1992, in which the Sacramento Surge defeated the Orlando Thunder 21‚Äì17 before 43,789. In 1988 (Jets and Browns) and 1990 (Steelers and Patriots), NFL pre-season games were played at Olympic Stadium. =Baseball= Detail of the roof including the foul lines In 1977, the stadium replaced Jarry Park Stadium as the home ballpark of the National League's Montreal Expos. As a part of the team's franchise grant, a domed stadium was supposed to be in place for the 1972 baseball season. However, due to the delays in constructing Olympic Stadium, until 1977, the Expos annually sought and received a waiver to remain at Jarry. As late as January 1977, it was thought the Expos would have to play at least part of the 1977 season at Jarry as well. The Parti Qu√©b√©cois' landslide victory in the 1976 provincial elections caused the Expos to break off lease talks. However, an agreement was reached in February, and an official announcement came in March. The Expos regularly played 81 home games every season until 2003, when they played 22 home games in Puerto Rico at Hiram Bithorn Stadium in San Juan. The Expos played 59 home games at Olympic Stadium in each of their final two seasons of 2003 and 2004; the franchise moved south to Washington, D.C. for the 2005 season and became the Washington Nationals. Olympic Stadium's first baseball game was played on April 15, 1977. In front of 57,592, the Expos lost 7‚Äì2 to the Philadelphia Phillies. However, the Expos had to use a hacksaw to cut open the locks because the OIB did not have a master key. The Expos played five home playoff games in 1981; two in the NLDS against the Phillies, and three in the NLCS against the Los Angeles Dodgers, who went on to win the World Series. On October 19, the Expos lost the decisive fifth game, 2‚Äì1, to the Dodgers on Rick Monday's ninth-inning home run. In 1982, the Major League Baseball All-Star Game was played at Olympic Stadium in front of 59,057‚Äîa stadium record for baseball. On September 29, 2004, the Expos played their last game in Montreal, losing 9‚Äì1 to the Florida Marlins before 31,395. Olympic Stadium panoramic during an MLB preseason game in 2014 Olympic Stadium proved to be somewhat problematic as a baseball venue. As in all multipurpose stadiums, the lower seating tier was set further back than in baseball-specific parks to accommodate the football field. However, since Canadian football fields are longer and wider than American football fields, Olympic Stadium's lower tier was set back even further than comparable seats at American multipurpose stadiums. The upper deck was one of the highest in the majors; as was the case with most of its multipurpose counterparts, most of the upper-deck seats, particularly those in the outfield, were too far away to be of any use during the regular season. The Expos felt considerable chagrin that they were not consulted on the stadium's location, design, or construction even though they were slated to be its primary tenants. Nonetheless, for most of their tenure they put considerable effort into making the atmosphere friendlier for baseball. During the 1970s and early 1980s, fans arriving at the stadium from the Metro were greeted by an oom-pah band playing \\"The Happy Wanderer.\\" Whenever an opposing pitcher tried to hold a runner at first rather than pitch, the sound system would cluck at him like a chicken. Before the 1991 season, the OIB began a major overhaul on the stadium's baseball configuration. The lower deck in center field was removed to make room for a larger scoreboard with replay capability.Clem's Baseball Blog entry on Olympic Stadium That scoreboard was installed ahead of the 1992 season. Also ahead of the 1992 season, the running track was removed, home plate was moved closer to the stands and new seats closer to the field were installed. Several distant sections of permanent seating beyond the outfield fence were closed, replaced with bleacher seats directly behind the fence. The total seating capacity for baseball was reduced from a high of around 60,400 to 46,000. The Expos were very successful in the stadium for a time, with above National League median attendance in 1977 and from 1979 to 1983. The Expos outdrew the New York Mets from 1977 to 1983, and 1994 to 1996, as well as the New York Yankees in 1982 and 1983. The stadium's playing conditions left much to be desired. For most of the Expos' tenure, the playing surface was an extremely thin AstroTurf carpet, with only equally thin padding between it and the concrete floor. It was so hard on players' knees that visiting teams frequently ran at a nearby park. Longtime Expos trainer Ron McClain begged for a replacement, but the OIB was unwilling to spend the $1 million needed for a new surface. Before the roof finally arrived, players had to contend with huge patches of ice in early April or late September. Additionally, for most of the Expos' tenure, the padding on the fence was so thin that fielders risked severe injury by going after long fly balls. However, the OIB was also unwilling to replace the padding. By the 1990s, several free agents specifically demanded that the Expos be taken out of consideration due to the poor playing conditions. By the mid-1990s, owner Claude Brochu concluded that Olympic Stadium was not suitable as a baseball venue, and actively campaigned for a replacement. Brochu sold the team to Jeffrey Loria in 2000, who was equally dissatisfied with Olympic Stadium; he bluntly stated, \\"We cannot stay here.\\" However, Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard refused to authorize public funding deemed necessary for a replacement, in part because Olympic Stadium still had not been paid for. The poor conditions played a role in the Expos nearly being disbanded in the 2001 Major League Baseball contraction plan, which fell through due to court rulings. Ten years after the last Expos game at Olympic Stadium, the Toronto Blue Jays played two spring training games at the stadium against the New York Mets on March 28 and 29, 2014, with combined attendance of 96,350. The Jays have continued this practice in subsequent years, against the Cincinnati Reds on April 3 and 4, 2015, with combined attendance of 96,545, the Boston Red Sox on April 1 and 2, 2016, with combined attendance of 106,102, the Pittsburgh Pirates on March 31 and April 1, 2017, combined attendance of 95,382, the St. Louis Cardinals on March 26 and 27, 2018, with combined attendance of 51,151 and the Milwaukee Brewers on March 25 and 26, 2019. The New York Yankees were scheduled to play there on March 23 and 24, 2020 but the games were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Longest home runs Willie Stargell of the Pittsburgh Pirates hit the longest home run at Olympic Stadium on May 20, 1978, driving the ball into the second deck in right field for an estimated distance of 535 feet. The yellow seat that marked the location where the ball landed has been removed from the 300 level. The seat is now preserved at the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame. Stargell also hit a notable home run at the Expos' original Montreal home, Jarry Park, which landed in a swimming pool beyond the right field fence. On April 4, 1988, the Expos' Opening Day, Darryl Strawberry of the New York Mets hit a ball off a speaker which hangs off a concrete ring at Olympic Stadium, estimated to have traveled 525 feet. \\"Oh Henry\\" Rodr√≠guez hit a ball on June 15, 1997, that bounced off the concrete ring in right field, caromed up to hit the roof, and came down, hitting a speaker. The distance traveled by this ball is also estimated at 525 feet. The longest home run hit to left field was Vladimir Guerrero's blast on July 28, 2003, that hit an advertising sign directly below the left field upper deck. The ad was later replaced with a sign reading \\"VLAD 502\\". =Soccer= Olympic Stadium with natural grass field The Olympic Stadium was the home of the NASL's Montreal Manic soccer team from 1981 to 1983. A 1981 playoff game against the Chicago Sting attracted a crowd of over 58,000. Several games of the 2007 FIFA Under 20 World Cup were played at Olympic Stadium and drew the largest crowds of the tournament, including two sell-outs of 55,800. Olympic Stadium hosted a CONCACAF Champions League quarter-final game pitting the original Montreal Impact ‚Äì who played primarily in the adjacent Saputo Stadium ‚Äì against Club Santos Laguna of the Liga MX (Mexico First Division) on February 25, 2009. This was the first time an international soccer game took place in Montreal during the winter months. The Impact won 2‚Äì0 in front of a record crowd of 55,571. The stadium was also home to a friendly match between the Impact and A.C. Milan of the Italian Serie A on June 2, 2010 before 47,861. On July 25, 2009, Olympic Stadium became the first stadium outside France to host Ligue 1's Troph√©e des Champions, a super cup played by the winner of Ligue 1 and the Coupe de France. Over 34,000 attended the game. Bordeaux defeated Guingamp, 2‚Äì0. The game was held in Montreal to help Ligue 1 break into the growing North America soccer market. On March 17, 2012, a record crowd of 58,912 packed Olympic Stadium to cheer on the current version of the Montreal Impact for their MLS debut on home soil, in an entertaining 1‚Äì1 draw with the Chicago Fire, setting a new attendance record for professional soccer in Quebec. That record was later broken on May 12, 2012 with 60,860 people for a match against the LA Galaxy, also setting a new attendance record for professional soccer in Canada. On August 24, 2014, the Olympic Stadium hosted the final match of the 2014 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup. On April 29, 2015, a record crowd of 61,004 attended the final match of the CONCACAF Champions League between the Montreal Impact and Club Am√©rica, establishing a new record attendance for professional soccer in Canada. The Olympic Stadium hosted tournament matches for the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup along with other stadiums across Canada. One notable game was the semi-final match-up between the United States and Germany that took place on June 30, 2015, which drew a crowd of 51,176 people. The Americans won 2‚Äì0 in front of a largely partisan crowd and then went on to win their record third FIFA Women's World Cup trophy the following Sunday in Vancouver. This stadium is one of Canada's three candidate venues for the 2026 FIFA World Cup and is expected to get a retractable roof during the renovations for this sports event. = Office space = Starting in 2018, the Desjardins Group plans to move approximately 1000 of its employees into the Montreal Tower. The company plans to occupy 7 of the 12 floors available in the tower. It is estimated that around $60 million in renovations are required before Desjardins can move in. =Other= Olympic Stadium hosted the 1978 World Junior Speed Skating Championships where they crowned the American siblings Eric and Beth Heiden as junior world champions. In August 1979 the Olympic Stadium hosted the 1979 IAAF World Cup in Athletics. The Catholic Charismatic Renewal Assembly took place in the presence of Father Emiliano Tardif in 1979. On June 20, 1980, Roberto Dur√°n defeated Sugar Ray Leonard to win the WBC boxing world's welterweight championship at the Olympic Stadium. The Drum Corps International World Championship finals were held at this arena in 1981 and 1982. On September 11, 1984, Pope John Paul II participated in a youth rally with about 55,000 people in attendance. Full view of the Montreal Olympic Stadium's mast from the side A view from the upper deck of the monster truck layout Montreal Biodome in front of Olympic Stadium and its tower On October 30, 2010, a special mass, to commemorate the ascension to sainthood of Brother Andr√©, was held at the stadium. Over 30,000 people attended. In 2017, the venue was the site of the 2017 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships. =Attendance record= Pink Floyd attracted the largest paid crowd to the Olympic Stadium: 78,322 people on July 6, 1977. The second-largest crowd was 73,898 for Emerson, Lake & Palmer on August 26, 1977. The largest crowds for an opera performance were on June 16 and 18, 1988, with 63,000 to watch a production of Aida. Transit The stadium is directly connected to the Pie-IX metro station on the Green Line of the Montreal Metro. Viau metro station on the Green Line is also nearby. Facts and figures *At , the Olympic Stadium is the world's tallest inclined structure. *Well over its original budget, the stadium ended up costing $770 million to construct. By 2006, the final cost had risen to $1.47 billion when calculating in repairs, modifications and interest paid out. It took 30 years to finally pay off the cost, leading to its nickname of \\"The Big Owe\\" (a play on \\"The Big O\\"). *The roof is only above the field of play. As a result, a number of pop-ups and long home runs hit the roof over the years, necessitating the painting of orange lines on the roof to separate foul balls from fair balls. *During their years playing in Olympic Stadium the Expos were one of only two teams not to employ the traditional yellow-painted foul poles with the New York Mets being the other; Olympic's poles were painted red while the Mets' home, Shea Stadium (and later Citi Field), used orange poles. *The Olympic Stadium holds the record for a soccer game attendance in Canada. At the 1976 Summer Olympics soccer final, 72,000 people witnessed East Germany's 3‚Äì1 win over Poland. *A yellow seat on the 300 level commemorated a home run by Willie Stargell of the Pittsburgh Pirates.

The character was created by writer Scott Lobdell and artist Brandon Peterson and first appeared in The Uncanny X-Men #299 (April 1993). He is the son of Sabretooth and Mystique.  Fictional character biography  Posing as German spy Leni Zauber, Mystique seduced freelance supervillain Victor Creed (Sabretooth) while he was in Germany on a mission. Mystique later gave birth to a normal human child‚ÄîGraydon‚Äîwhom she gave up for adoption, although she kept an eye on him. When Graydon learned that he was the son of two mutants who had abandoned him as an inconvenience, he grew resentful of all mutants, and that resentment colored his outlook for the rest of his life.Sabretooth #1-4 In his adult years, Graydon formed a group called the Friends of Humanity, dedicated to opposing mutant civil rights by committing acts of terrorism against peaceful mutants and mutant sympathizers, and using the acts of violent mutants such as Magneto to rally support for their cause. =Upstarts= Creed also came to join the Upstarts, a group of wealthy and powerful individuals who had been brought together by Selene and the enigmatic telepathic Gamesmaster with the sole purpose of killing mutants for points in a twisted game. After learning of his parents' identities, Creed sought to kill them as part of the Upstarts' game. Disguised as the armored Tribune, Creed hired assassins to kill his mother and had his father implanted with a bomb. His father managed to remove the device and confronted his son, who callously stabbed Sabretooth's assistant Birdy, a mutant telepath whom Sabretooth employed to keep his homicidal rages in check. During the Upstarts' self-professed \\"Younghunt\\", Creed was blackmailed into revealing the location of the Upstarts' prisoners by the New Warriors, who threatened to expose Creed as a mutant collaborator and the son of mutants.\\"New Warriors\\" Vol. 1 # 45 (March 1994) =Death= Later, using the resources he had gained through the Friends of Humanity, and with the support of the government-sponsored anti- mutant taskforce Operation: Zero Tolerance, Creed nominated himself as a presidential candidate and ran on an anti-mutant platform. Capitalizing on a near-hysterical fear of mutants in the general public, Creed's popularity swelled, which led to the Daily Bugle newspaper launching an investigation into Creed's activities. When a reporter from the Bugle obtained information regarding Creed's parentage, Zero Tolerance's leader Bastion killed the journalist to prevent the news from leaking out. Although they stopped the reporter, Creed did not manage to catch that the X-Men had also infiltrated his presidential campaign, by planting Bobby Drake (under the alias of \\"Drake Roberts\\") and Sam Guthrie (under the alias of \\"Samson Guthry\\") as Creed's assistants. On the eve of the election, Creed was assassinated during a campaign speech when a plasma beam completely disintegrated him.X-Factor #130 Several years later, the miniseries X-Men Forever revealed that a future version of Mystique had fired the shot, having sworn to kill Graydon for his part in the Friends of Humanity's brutal attack on Trevor Chase, the grandson of her lover Destiny. =Purifiers= The pages of X-Force show a group of Purifiers digging up the corpse of Graydon Creed, his body is then taken back to their base. It is re-animated by Bastion using the techno-organic virus taken from an \\"offspring\\" of Magus.X-Force vol. 3 #3 Creed later went public with his return, claiming that his death was faked all along to allow him to go underground and avoid persecution from mutants. During the Second Coming storyline, Graydon Creed, alongside Steven Lang, is killed by Hope Summers.X-Force vol. 3 #28 =Hunt for Wolverine= During the \\"Hunt for Wolverine\\" storyline, Sabretooth, Lady Deathstrike, and Daken fight their way past the zombies and soldiers from Soteira Killteam Nine in order to get to the power station where the glowing green box suspected of causing the zombie outbreak is located. Sabretooth discovers that one of the soldiers is a zombie version of his son Graydon. After Lady Deathstrike and Daken are stabbed by a zombie version of Lord Dark Wind, Sabretooth fights his zombified son who states that there is 10 minutes left before Maybelle is burned to the ground.Hunt for Wolverine: Claws of a Killer #3. Marvel Comics. As Sabretooth continues his fight with Graydon, he tries to get answers on how Graydon came back from the dead. He doesn't get an answer. After slaying the zombie Lord Dark Wind, Lady Deathstrike stabs the zombie Graydon in the neck.Hunt for Wolverine: Claws of a Killer #4. Marvel Comics. Other versions =Age of Apocalypse= Graydon Creed goes by the name 'Horror Show' in the Age of Apocalypse reality. He's a part of the X-Terminated team with a handful of other humans. He's wearing an armor and appears to have a flamethrower and other firearms.Age of Apocalypse #1 He mentions that his father, Sabretooth, was apparently a brutal, abusive father.Age of Apocalypse #3 During the X-Termination crossover, AoA Nightcrawler's trip home resulted in the release of three evil beings that destroy anyone they touch. Several casualties resulted, including the AoA's Sabretooth, Horror Show, and Fiend, as well as the X-Treme X-Men's Xavier and Hercules.Astonishing X-Men #60 =Age of X= In the Age of X reality, Graydon Creed had led a strike force that put the mutant race on the verge of extinction. =House of M= After Magneto's takeover of Genosha, Graydon Creed rose to prominence as an anti-mutant activist, becoming friends with vice-president Bolivar Trask. His prominence was short-lived as Magneto (who compared Graydon Creed to Adolf Hitler) viewed it as his duty to rid the world of the man. Magneto sent his assassin Sabretooth to kill him. Graydon Creed's massacred body was found by government agents, and Trask ordered his death ruled an accident to prevent panic.Civil War: House of M #3 (2008) =Mutant X= In this reality, Graydon Greed is still the son of Mystique and Sabretooth and the founder of the Friends of Humanity. He became President of the United States after Mister Fantastic went missing. Graydon also reinstated S.H.I.E.L.D. and promoted Nick Fury to General.\\"Mutant X\\" (vol. 1) #18 (April 2000) In other media =Television= Graydon Creed appeared in the X-Men animated series voiced by John Stocker. As in the comics, Creed hates mutants because he is ashamed of being part mutant himself, and because his parents, Mystique and Sabretooth, were abusive to him. Many years later, Graydon founded the Friends of Humanity, an anti-mutant hate group that sought to vilify mutants. After the Beast's pardon by the President, Graydon's resentment grew even more and the Friends of Humanity began targeting the X-Men. In the episode, \\"Time Fugitives\\", he hires a scientist to create a virus that would wipe out the mutant race, but would be relatively harmless to ordinary humans. While giving a speech about the plague's effects, Graydon attempts to infect Beast with the virus but is stopped by Bishop. During the struggle, Graydon accidentally infects himself and retreats back to the lab for medical aid. The X-Men follow him, attack the base and the scientist reveals himself to be Apocalypse. The X-Men help him get clear of the battle. The X-Men destroy the virus and Graydon returns to the Friends of Humanity headquarters. In \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", Beast begins dating a former patient, named Carly. The FOH protest outside the clinic, and later kidnap Carly. Beast begins searching for her and Wolverine infiltrates the Friends of Humanity, pretending to be the victim of an assault by evil mutants. Graydon gladly accepts him into the fold. As they get to know each other, Wolverine begins to suspect that Graydon Creed is Sabretooth's son. An enraged Beast attacks the FOH headquarters and the X-Men use a holographic projector to display information on Sabretooth in front of the Friends of Humanity, including his real name (given in this episode as Graydon Creed Senior). Ruined, Graydon suffers a nervous breakdown as his followers abandon him. Creed spends months in a psychiatric hospital. Once he recovers, Graydon tries to return to the folds of the Friends of Humanity organisation in the episode \\"Bloodlines\\"; the council that now rules over Friends of Humanity, however, after having been made aware of his having a mutant for a father, have been digging further into his past and uncovered that his family tree \\"bears much mutant/rotten fruit\\"; they declare that, in order to lead the Friends of Humanity once more, he has to prove himself by killing Mystique (his birth mother) and Nightcrawler (his younger half- brother): Creed then kidnaps Mystique and sends Nightcrawler a letter, telling him that he must come to the Friends of Humanity base or they will kill his mother. Nightcrawler seeks the help of Rogue and Wolverine; they locate the base and walk straight into a trap. Graydon captures and tries to kill all of them, but the mutants break free and destroy the base. Creed is recovered by the Friends of Humanity and callously delivered via parachute to Sabretooth's cabin in the woods, who presumably tortures him.

U.N.C.L.E. is an organization consisting of agents of all nationalities. Responsible for \\"maintaining political and legal order anywhere in the world\\", it is multinational in makeup and international in scope, protecting and defending nations regardless of size or political persuasion. U.N.C.L.E. operates in Communist and Third World countries the same way that it does in the Western nations. In the episode entitled \\"The Shark Affair,\\" (episode 4 from season 1, from 1964) enforcement agent of U.N.C.L.E. Napoleon Solo reveals that U.N.C.L.E. is sponsored by the US, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Greece, Spain, Italy and Yugoslavia. Its primary opponent is the independent international criminal organization, THRUSH. Headquarters U.N.C.L.E. headquarters is in New York City near the lower East 40's United Nations. U.N.C.L.E. headquarters has four levels: one ground level; two higher levels (Waverly's office is on the top floor) and one sub-level. The roof has radar, a laser beam weapon, a helipad and communication antennas, disguised as billboards, that have a worldwide reach. Below the sub-level, there is an underground docking area and a tunnel that runs under the United Nations headquarters giving U.N.C.L.E.'s boats access to the East River. The headquarters is designed as a fortress hidden in the center of a block of buildings with Brownstone apartments serving as the exterior facade. On one end of the block is a public parking garage (complete with machine gun bays hidden in the ceiling). On the other end is a three- story whitestone building. The first and second floors of the whitestone are occupied by The Masque Club, a private, members-only \\"key club\\" (like the Playboy Club) in which the waitresses wear masks. On the third floor are located the offices of U.N.C.L.E.'s propaganda front, a charity fundraising organization. There are four primary entrances to U.N.C.L.E. headquarters. In the daytime, field agents are admitted by way of Del Floria's, a small, nondescript tailor/dry-cleaning shop located one flight below street level. The agents go to the single fitting booth and turn the coat hook on the back wall. Outside in the shop, an operator activates a mechanism on the pressing machine that releases the disguised armored door. The wall swings inward and an agent finds him/herself in the main admissions area. There, a receptionist pins on a security badge (white or later, yellow for highest security clearance; red and green for low clearance and visitors). A chemical on the receptionist's fingers activates the badge. There are also entrances through the Men's and Women's lockers at the rear of the parking garage (admissions for non-field personnel). After hours, when Del Floria's is closed, agents may also enter through the Masque Club or through the offices of the charitable organization. Although in theory the location of U.N.C.L.E.'s New York headquarters is supposed to be secret, the very first episode of the series, \\"The Vulcan Affair\\", demonstrated that it was a poorly-kept secret, at best, as the very teaser of that episode shows THRUSH operatives infiltrating U.N.C.L.E. headquarters through Del Floria's entrance in an attempt to mount an armed assault and kill U.N.C.L.E.'s Section One, Number 1, Mr. Waverly. Other episodes showing THRUSH's knowledge of the location of U.N.C.L.E. headquarters include \\"The Deadly Games Affair\\", \\"The Deadly Decoy Affair\\" and \\"The Mad Mad Tea Party Affair\\" (all first-season episodes). In \\"The Deadly Decoy Affair\\", the Del Floria entrance is even used for egress during a high- profile prisoner transfer during daylight hours. Although, as noted in \\"The Double Affair\\" and other episodes, THRUSH has a very effective intelligence service and has also, as demonstrated in \\"The Mad, Mad Tea Party Affair\\" successfully corrupted U.N.C.L.E. personnel, or infiltrated their own as moles. The New York office is but one of several located around the world -- and some also use the Del Floria tailor shop as a front (as seen, for example, with U.N.C.L.E.'s Italian headquarters in \\"The King of Knaves Affair\\"). Logo The official logo of the organization is a black Nicolosi-projection globe with some lines of longitude and latitude picked out in white. Black concentric rings surround the globe; to the right of it is the black silhouette of a man in a black suit holding a gun at his side, and a black band beneath the globe and the man features the name \\"U.N.C.L.E.\\" in the \\"Decorated 035\\" font. The logo is normally superimposed on a Mercator-style map of the world--yellow-brown continents with no country borders (a tribute to the one-world philosophy of U.N.C.L.E.) and blue seas--but is also used plain or with tones inverted on official U.N.C.L.E. documents. Structure U.N.C.L.E. is subdivided into eight sections, though six of these have overlapping areas of responsibility: =Section I: Policy and Operations= This is the administrative branch. It contains the five chiefs of U.N.C.L.E. as well as all sector and station chiefs. There is a conference for everyone in this section yearly as well as an annual meeting of the five chiefs alone. The five chiefs administer the business of U.N.C.L.E. from five regional offices that correspond loosely (but not exactly --- there is overlap) to the five major continents. The five offices are: New York, Caracas, Nairobi, New Delhi and Berlin. Alexander Waverly designated as \\"Number One, Section One\\" and is in charge of U.N.C.L.E.'s New York headquarters. However, in the season one episode \\"The Brain Killer Affair\\", under T.H.R.U.S.H. mind control, Mr Waverly states that the home address of one of the other four chiefs was in France. =Section II: Operations and Enforcement= This is the section that contains the field agents like Napoleon Solo and Illya Kuryakin. Solo is assigned to Section Two, Number One and is U.N.C.L.E.'s Chief Enforcement Agent. Illya Kuryakin is appointed Section Two Number Two and operates out of the New York office. Waverly sometimes worries that Solo \\"will not be with us very long\\", which will benefit no one except Illya, who is right behind him on the promotions list. =Section III: Enforcement and Intelligence= These are the armed, active-duty field agents, including all \\"junior\\" enforcement agents. Intelligence also controls couriers and similar functionaries. =Section IV: Intelligence and Communications= This is the beginning of the support personnel sections. Any agent who works at a computer terminal or provides information for the field agents is a member of this section. As with such organization as the C.I.A. and NSA, U.N.C.L.E. maintains a staff of trained analysts who evaluate everything from maps and strike photos to data obtained in a raid. =Section V: Communication and Security= Given the global responsibilities of U.N.C.L.E., communications is a key supportive function. Security overlaps, providing guards for such things as field meetings, including the \\"Summit Five\\" conference attended yearly by Waverly and the other Section Heads. =Section VI: Security and Personnel= Internal security is the responsibility of this section, supplying the various internal guards and also conducting the \\"sanitizing\\" or \\"clean-up\\" operations after a field operation - including the removal of bodies, which would attract unwanted police attention and prove very hard to explain. Those who handle basic personnel matters (like hiring and medical insurance processing, among other normal business functions) are also members of this section. =Section VII: Propaganda and Finance= The Propaganda section is located on the third floor of the whitestone building adjacent to the N.Y. headquarters and functions as U.N.C.L.E.'s public \\"front\\" as one of the \\"think tanks\\" common in New York and Washington and also houses a charity fundraising organization. It is part of this section's job to see to it that the public never sees the very secret face of the real U.N.C.L.E. =Section VIII: Camouflage and Deception= Known more colloquially as \\"The Lab.\\" Origins According to The Cloak and Swagger Affair, a documentary about the making of the series included with the 2007 DVD release, the producers of The Man from U.N.C.L.E. originally intended to leave the meaning of the U.N.C.L.E. acronym a mystery (just as the meaning of THRUSH was never revealed in the series -- although the 4th book, \\"The Dagger Affair\\", in The Man from U.N.C.L.E. paperback series postulated that THRUSH stood for the \\"Technological Hierarchy for the Removal of Undesirables and the Subjugation of Humanity\\" http://www.manfromuncle.org/reviewp1.htm). The documentary states that after a protest from the [United Nations], which did not want to be connected to a fictional organization (such as, for example, \\"United Nations Criminal Law Enforcement\\"), the writers came up with a meaning that also became part of the series' trademark closing credit, thanking the United Network Command for Law and Enforcement for its cooperation with the producers of The Man from U.N.C.L.E. Other sources credit producer Sam Rolfe as originally intending that U.N.C.L.E. be identified as an arm of the United Nations (\\"Behind that door is a man who reports only to the Secretariat of the United Nations!\\" supposedly was part of his network pitch). As noted above, this idea was discarded for reasons still debated.

This system was discovered by Haskell Curry in his doctoral thesis Grundlagen der kombinatorischen Logik, whose results are set out in Curry (1930). Definition The combinators are defined as follows: * B x y z = x (y z) * C x y z = x z y * K x y = x * W x y = x y y Intuitively, * B x y z is the composition of the arguments x and y applied to the argument z; * C x y z swaps the arguments y and z; * K x y discards the argument y; * W x y duplicates the argument y. Connection to other combinators In recent decades, the SKI combinator calculus, with only two primitive combinators, K and S, has become the canonical approach to combinatory logic. B, C, and W can be expressed in terms of S and K as follows: * B = S (K S) K * C = S (S (K (S (K S) K)) S) (K K) * K = K * W = S S (S K) Going the other direction, SKI can be defined in terms of B,C,K,W as: * I = W K * K = K * S = B (B (B W) C) (B B) = B (B W) (B B C).Raymond Smullyan (1994) Diagonalization and Self-Reference. Oxford Univ. Press: 344, 3.6(d) and 3.7. Connection to intuitionistic logic The combinators B, C, K and W correspond to four well-known axioms of sentential logic: :AB: (B ‚Üí C) ‚Üí ((A ‚Üí B) ‚Üí (A ‚Üí C)), :AC: (A ‚Üí (B ‚Üí C)) ‚Üí (B ‚Üí (A ‚Üí C)), :AK: A ‚Üí (B ‚Üí A), :AW: (A ‚Üí (A ‚Üí B)) ‚Üí (A ‚Üí B). Function application corresponds to the rule modus ponens: :MP: from A and A ‚Üí B infer B. The axioms AB, AC, AK and AW, and the rule MP are complete for the implicational fragment of intuitionistic logic.

Two sequences that differ in the order of their terms define different compositions of their sum, while they are considered to define the same partition of that number. Every integer has finitely many distinct compositions. Negative numbers do not have any compositions, but 0 has one composition, the empty sequence. Each positive integer n has 2n‚àí1 distinct compositions. Bijection between 3 bit binary numbers and compositions of 4 A weak composition of an integer n is similar to a composition of n, but allowing terms of the sequence to be zero: it is a way of writing n as the sum of a sequence of non-negative integers. As a consequence every positive integer admits infinitely many weak compositions (if their length is not bounded). Adding a number of terms 0 to the end of a weak composition is usually not considered to define a different weak composition; in other words, weak compositions are assumed to be implicitly extended indefinitely by terms 0\\\\. To further generalize, an A-restricted composition of an integer n, for a subset A of the (nonnegative or positive) integers, is an ordered collection of one or more elements in A whose sum is n.  Examples  The 32 compositions of 6 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 . . . 1 + 5 6 The 11 partitions of 6 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 . . . 3 + 3 6 The sixteen compositions of 5 are: *5 *4 + 1 *3 + 2 *3 + 1 + 1 *2 + 3 *2 + 2 + 1 *2 + 1 + 2 *2 + 1 + 1 + 1 *1 + 4 *1 + 3 + 1 *1 + 2 + 2 *1 + 2 + 1 + 1 *1 + 1 + 3 *1 + 1 + 2 + 1 *1 + 1 + 1 + 2 *1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1. Compare this with the seven partitions of 5: *5 *4 + 1 *3 + 2 *3 + 1 + 1 *2 + 2 + 1 *2 + 1 + 1 + 1 *1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1. It is possible to put constraints on the parts of the compositions. For example the five compositions of 5 into distinct terms are: *5 *4 + 1 *3 + 2 *2 + 3 *1 + 4. Compare this with the three partitions of 5 into distinct terms: *5 *4 + 1 *3 + 2.  Number of compositions  Conventionally the empty composition is counted as the sole composition of 0, and there are no compositions of negative integers. There are 2n‚àí1 compositions of n ‚â• 1; here is a proof: Placing either a plus sign or a comma in each of the n ‚àí 1 boxes of the array : \\\\big(\\\\, \\\\overbrace{1\\\\, \\\\square\\\\, 1\\\\, \\\\square\\\\, \\\\ldots\\\\, \\\\square\\\\, 1\\\\, \\\\square\\\\, 1}^n\\\\, \\\\big) produces a unique composition of n. Conversely, every composition of n determines an assignment of pluses and commas. Since there are n ‚àí 1 binary choices, the result follows. The same argument shows that the number of compositions of n into exactly k parts (a k-composition) is given by the binomial coefficient {n-1\\\\choose k-1}. Note that by summing over all possible number of parts we recover 2n‚àí1 as the total number of compositions of n: : \\\\sum_{k=1}^n {n-1 \\\\choose k-1} = 2^{n-1}. For weak compositions, the number is {n+k-1\\\\choose k-1} = {n+k-1 \\\\choose n}, since each k-composition of n + k corresponds to a weak one of n by the rule : a_1+a_2+ \\\\ldots + a_k = n +k \\\\quad \\\\mapsto \\\\quad (a_1 -1) + (a_2-1) + \\\\ldots + (a_k - 1) = n It follows from this formula that the number of weak compositions of n into exactly k parts equals the number of weak compositions of k ‚àí 1 into exactly n + 1 parts. For A-restricted compositions, the number of compositions of n into exactly k parts is given by the extended binomial (or polynomial) coefficient \\\\binom{k}{n}_{(1)_{a\\\\in A}}=[x^n]\\\\left(\\\\sum_{a\\\\in A} x^a\\\\right)^k, where the square brackets indicate the extraction of the coefficient of x^n in the polynomial that follows it.  Homogeneous polynomials  The dimension of the vector space K[x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n]_d of homogeneous polynomial of degree d in n variables over the field K is the number of weak compositions of n. In fact, a basis for the space is given by the set of monomials x_1^{d_1}\\\\cdots x_n^{d_n} such that d_1 + \\\\ldots + d_n = d. Since the exponents d_i are allowed to be zero, then the number of such monomials is exactly by the number of weak compositions of n.

Her best-known book is the No. 1 New York Times bestselling book Embraced by the Light, (1992) describing her near-death experience. It was followed by The Awakening Heart (1996), which was also a best-seller. The Ripple Effect (1999) and Embraced by the Light: Prayers and Devotions for Daily Living (2001) were both published independently. Early life and career Eadie, who is part Native American, was born in Valentine, Nebraska and raised on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota. When she was four, Betty's parents separated and she was placed in St. Francis Indian School, one of the American Indian boarding schools at the time, along with six of her siblings. While in high school, she dropped out to care for a younger sister. She later returned to receive her diploma, eventually pursuing a college degree. She converted to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), in which she says she was largely inactive until her Near Death Experience (NDE), after which she became active and served church callings in her ward in Seattle. After her NDE, Betty began volunteering her time at a cancer research center comforting dying patients and their families. She then studied hypnotherapy, graduating at the top of her class, and later opened her own clinic. After \\"Embraced\\" was published, Betty gave up her hypnotherapy practice and began traveling extensively throughout the United States, Canada, Great Britain and Ireland, speaking on death and the afterlife. Today, after more than 37 years of NDE studies, Betty J. Eadie continues to collect and evaluate near-death accounts, as well as giving speeches and lectures. NDE account In her NDE account, Eadie reports many phenomena similar to other NDE accounts, such as going through a dark tunnel, seeing a bright light and experiencing a Life review, as well as other features unique to her story. In 1973, at age 31, Eadie was recovering from a surgical operation. Eadie reported that she first felt herself fading to lifelessness, then felt a surge of energy followed by a \\"pop\\" and feeling of release, a sense of freedom and movement unhindered by inertia or gravity. She was met by three angelic beings who spoke with her about her prior existence and hitherto suppressed memories in order to participate in earthly experience. She traveled to terrestrial locations such as her home merely by thinking about them, returned to her hospital, and then passed on through a dark tunnel-like medium in which she reported sensing other beings in a transitory preparatory stage. Exiting the tunnel, Eadie approached an intense white light and met in heaven the embrace of Jesus Christ. During this encounter, she reported a strong sense of love and a high-speed transfer of answers to her many questions. Possessing a corporeal identity of an ethereal kind, she visited numerous places, persons, and phenomena such as natural settings and gardens beyond the character of the conventionally material, and was taken on a tour of sorts of learning experiences that she said felt equivalent to weeks or months. In addition to discussing traditional Christian subjects such as prayer, creation, and the Garden of Eden, Eadie reported visiting a library of the mind. Here it became possible to know anything or anyone in history or the present, in minute and unambiguous detail, as well as being able to observe individuals on Earth and being taken to distant reaches and civilizations of the universe. Warned initially upon arrival that she had died prematurely, Eadie was at last told she must return in order to fulfill the personal mission allocated her. Its specific character, like numerous other details, were removed from her memory, in order, she said she was told, to prevent difficulties in her fulfilling it. Upon protesting, she was made to understand the reason behind the necessity for her return and reluctantly agreed to do so. She exacted a promise that she would not be made to stay on earth longer than necessary. She reported her return to material corporeality as extremely heavy-feeling and unpleasant, initially intermittent in phases, and accompanied not long after by a demonic visitation that was cut short by an angelic reappearance. Eadie's doctor reportedly verified her clinical death on a return visit to the hospital, attributing it to a hemorrhage during a nurses' shift change, and took great interest in her recollections. Independent verification of the length of her death was not possible, but she speculated it could have lasted up to four hours based on her memory of certain details preceding and following it. After Subsequent to her experience, she spoke of it very little and suffered a long-term depression. This, she attributed to the anticlimactic nature of returning to corporeality after experiencing the heaven of afterlife. She slowly became involved in near-death groups and studies and gave talks, subsequently going on to write her account in book form, which met with runaway success. While her account incorporated elements of traditional Christianity, it also met with a certain degree of resistance as well. This was largely, in part, to its teaching (as she reported she was given it) that some denominations might approximate truth better than others. She explains, however, that different teachings were more appropriate for certain individuals at their given stage of spiritual development, and therefore judgment should not be passed on them for where they were. Unlike many fundamentalist Christians,http://www.allanturner.com/ss01.html and despite her own strict Catholic upbringing, and her conversion to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), after her near-death experience, Eadie refers to God as \\"he\\" instead of \\"He\\" and insists that all religions are necessary for each person. She claims that each religion is necessary for each person, because of their different levels of spiritual enlightenment. This is contrary to the views, shared by many Christians worldwide, that Christianity is the one true, valid religion. Curiously, Eadie also claims that after her encounter with Jesus, she learned that Christ and God were in fact two separate entities, a view conflicting with that of her Protestant-taught tradition of the Holy Trinity. This is, however, in keeping with the teachings of the LDS Church. In addition, unlike some other Near-Death Experiencers, Eadie claims that reincarnation, as it is typically thought of, does not truly exist. ‚ÄúWe understood that memories would be contained in the cells of our new bodies. This was an idea that was completely new to me. I learned that all thoughts and experiences in our lives are recorded in our subconscious minds. They are also recorded in our cells, so that, not only is each cell imprinted with a genetic coding, it is also imprinted with every experience we have ever had. Further, I understood that these memories are passed down through the genetic coding to our children. These memories then account for many of the passed on traits in families, such as addictive tendencies, fears, strengths, and so on. I also learned that we do not have repeated lives on this earth; when we seem to \\"remember\\" a past life, we are actually recalling memories contained in these cells.‚Äù In Embraced by the Light (Hardcover Edition) (pg. 93) Eadie claims she was told that only a few return to this earth more than once, that some are sent back as teachers to help others.\\"Often, when I am asked what I understand about reincarnation, I think about this little girl. Life on earth is like going away to college. Our spirits stay here until we graduate, then we leave the campus and go on to further our development elsewhere. Some graduating students can return if they have acquired enough knowledge to return as teachers.\\" Betty J. Eadie, The Awakening Heart: My Continuing Journey to Love, p.157. Pocket Books, 1996 She taught similar withholding of censure on individuals for things like atheism and homosexuality and rejected a common traditional image of hell as an eternity of suffering, suggesting that her life review experience, in which she was made to live and feel the full positive and negative consequences of her cumulative actions in intense detail, including their effects on all around her, were a more than adequate equivalent and probably what the term truly signified. She also stressed that her key lesson was that life's purpose was to learn love and to grow through the exercise of free will, including making mistakes. Other teachings she recounted being given included the idea that there were few if any true accidents and that human lives and paths were chosen, agreed to, and prepared for in advance, with memory of such details suppressed and veiled. Suicide, she said she was told, was wrong because it deprived people of opportunities to learn and grow, and that there was always hope in life. Sequels The Awakening Heart is Eadie's second book and also became a NYT Bestseller in which she describes her challenges and experience that followed her NDE up through the time that Embraced By The Light was published, as well as giving additional details about her NDE that were not included in her first book.Eadie, Betty J., The Awakening Heart, cover matter, Pocket Books, 1996 The Ripple Effect pursued these further, incorporating discussion of the numerous letters she began to receive in response from readers, as well as discussing other NDE contacts she later developed. Eadie formed her own Publishing house,\\"Media Talk; Inspirational Author Founds Her Own Press,\\" The New York Times: Archives, By Karen Angel July 13, 1998 Onjinjinkta Publishing,Open Library, Onjinjinkta Publishing, Publisher, openlibrary.org through which she published her third book and her fourth book, Embraced By The Light Prayers and Devotions for Daily Living, as well as various works from other authors. Because of their appeal to the innate human desire for an understanding of afterlife, her works led to a strong reader response which she initially attempted to answer in detail but became forced to limit. To meet some of this demand, she developed a website for general information and inspirational materials, as well as distribution of her books and related materials. During a 2004 interview on Coast to Coast AM radio with George Noory, she said she was disappointed, following her first book's publication, that she was not permitted to return to the Celestial realm. While she could not presently know the full scope of her earthly purpose, she understood a film based on Embraced would also follow. Personal life Her husband, Joe, worked in aerospace computing and died in 2011. Together they had eight children, and as of 2011, fifteen grandchildren and 7 great- grandchildren.

This cuisine has a rich tradition of many distinct and local ways of cooking. One is a special form of tandoori cooking that is now famous in other parts of India, UK, Canada, Hong Kong and in many parts of the world. The local cuisine of Punjab is heavily influenced by the agriculture and farming lifestyle prevalent from the times of the ancient Indus Valley Civilization. Locally grown staple foods form the major part of the local cuisine. Distinctively Punjabi cuisine is known for its rich, buttery flavours along with the extensive vegetarian and meat dishes. Main dishes include sarhon dƒÅ sa√¢g (a stew whose main ingredient is mustard greens) and makki di roti (flatbreads made with cornmeal). Karrhi is a spicy, yellow gravy with cakes made of chickpea flour (besan), containing lemon juice, red pepper and turmeric. It is commonly served with rice or naan. Basmati rice is the indigenous variety of Punjab, and various meat- and vegetable-based rice dishes have been developed using it. Chicken tikka is a popular dish in Punjabi cuisine Mint paratha from Punjab, India Lassi from Punjab Style of cooking There are many styles of cooking in Punjab. In the villages many people still employ the traditional infrastructure for cooking purposes. This includes wood-fired and masonry ovens. Modern methods include cooking on gas cookers. Tandoori style of cooking involves use of the tandoor. In India, tandoori cooking is traditionally associated with Punjab The Rough Guide to Rajasthan, Delhi and Agra By Daniel Jacobs, Gavin Thomas as Punjabis embraced the tandoor on a regional level. This style of cooking became popular throughout India after the 1947 partition when Punjabis resettled in places such as Delhi. According to Planalp (1971), \\"the Panjab-style underground oven known as tandur is becoming increasingly popular in New Delhi\\" pointing to the Punjabi style of the tandoor.Planalp, Jack M. (1971) Heat Stress and Culture in North India. U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command, In rural Punjab, it is common to have communal tandoors,Pind Diyan Gallian PTC Channel - Bilga (Jalandhar) which are also called Kath tadoors in Punjabi. Staple foods Punjabi food thali Punjab is a major producer of wheat, rice and dairy products. These products also form the staple diet of the Punjabi people. The state of Punjab has one of the highest capita usage of dairy products in India.Times of India 30 06 2014 Therefore, dairy products form an important component of Punjabi diet. =Dairy products= Dairy products are a staple in Punjabi cuisine. Both cow milk and water buffalo milk are popular. Milk is used for drinking, to add to tea or coffee, to make homemade dahi (yogurt), for butter and making traditional Punjabi cottage cheese called paneer.Traditionally, yogurt is made every day using previous day's yogurt as the starting bacterial culture to ferment the milk. The Dahee is used as dressing for many raita dishes,to prepare Kadhi, to prepare cultured buttermilk (Chaas), and as a side dish in a meal.Misra, R., 2011. Indian Foods: AAPI‚Äôs Guide Indian Foods: AAPI‚Äôs Guide To Nutrition, Health and Diabetes page 46. Buttermilk is used in making various kinds of Lassi.Kaur, K., 2004. Postmodernity and Popular Culture in Amritsar'. Indian Social Science Review, 6(1), pp.107-34. It may also be used in curry preparations. Milk is also the prerequisite ingredient for butter and Ghee (clarified butter). Food additives and condiments Food additives and condiments are usually added to enhance the flavor of the food. Food coloring as additive is used in sweet dishes and desserts. Starch is used as a bulking agent. Common dishes =Breakfast= Aloo paratha with butter Breakfast recipes with respect to different regions within Punjab varies. Common ones are chana masala, chole kulche, aloo paratha, panner paratha, gobi paratha, paratha with curd, halwa poori,khana pakana : Halwa Puri bhatoora, falooda, makhni doodh, Amritsari lassi, masala chai, tea, Amritsari kulchas, dahi vada, dahi, khoa, paya, aloo paratha with butter, panjeeri with milk. In the upper Punjab Pakistan the Lahori Katlama is famous for breakfast as well. =Meat= Poultry, lamb and goat meat are the preferred meat sources in different regions of Punjab. Many dishes of meat variety is available and some of them are named below. Tandoori chicken * Biryani: lamb and chicken * Kebab: braised chicken or lamb meat, commonly served with naan and flat bread. * Keema: Braised minced lamb meat, commonly served with naan. * Lamb: including rogan josh, Bhuna Gosht,Know your state Punjab by gurkirat Singh and Anil Mittal Airhunt Publications Kadhai Gosht, Raan Gosht, Dal Gosht, Saag Gosht, Nihari, Rara Gosht, Paye da Shorba *Shami kebab, chicken karahi, Amritsari tandoori chicken, Punjabi Karhi (the chicken yogurt curry of Punjab), Butter Chicken (Murgh Makhni), chicken tikka, Paye. * Kunna Gosht, slow cooked meat prepared in Kunna (mitti ki bartan (clay utensil)) * Haleem is made of meat (beef or chicken) slow cooked with a mixture of legumes softened by overnight cooking it is a protein rich food with spices and aromatics like nutmeg served with wedge of lemon and saut√©ed onions. =Fish= Since Punjab is a landlocked region, freshwater fish, and not marine fish, forms an important part of the cuisine. Carp, rohu and catfish are the most commonly prepared fish. Other fish types include thela machi and tilapia. Recently shrimp has been introduced. Fish tikka is an Amritsari speciality. =Vegetarian= Kulcha amritsari Paneer, one of the South Asian cheese variants commonly used in cooking in Punjab Panjeeri * Khichdi, a grain-and-lentil dish:Alop ho riha Punjabi virsa by Harkesh Singh Kehal Pub Lokgeet Parkashan In the Punjab, khichdi is made of millet flour, mung beans and moth lentils (Vigna aconitifolia). However, khichdi made of rice and red lentils or mung beans is also consumed. * Paneer (freshly made cottage cheese) Recipes like Shahi Paneer; Khoya Paneer, Paneer Kofta (paneer chunks battered and fried, then simmered in a spicy gravy), Amritsari Paneer, Matar Paneer (paneer with green peas), paneer paratha (wheat flatbread stuffed with paneer),Palak Paneer * Panjiri: This is a traditional Punjabi dessert dish which has a generous amount of almonds, walnuts, pistachios, dry dates, cashew nuts along with whole wheat flour, sugar, edible gum, poppy seeds and fennel seeds to make the traditional dish of 'panjri' or also known as 'dabra'. * Legumes: a variety of legumes are used, including chickpeas, pigeon peas, red lentils, mung bean, red kidney beans (originally an import from the Americas) and black gram. Legumes may be used singly or in combination.Maah Daal : Maah Daaldaal ambarsari *Saag: a variety of leafy greens (including spinach and mustard greens), typically cooked down to a stew, seasoned with ginger, garlic, chilies and other spices, and often enriched with paneer or cream. Bathua is also added to enhance the flavor. It is served with butter on top and with makki ki roti. Saag is a winter and spring delicacy; it is one of the most popular dishes of Punjab. * Eggplant: Baingan bharta is similar to baba ghanoush in the way the eggplant is prepared by roasting and peeling the skin off, but much richer, with the incorporation of much cooked tomato, browned onion and a variety of spices instead of tahini. * Punj Ratani Dal: A thick gravy that uses 5 legumes, with tomato, browned onion and spices. * Punjabi Kadhi Pakora (traditional curry with rice. Kadhi is a type of curry made with yogurt or buttermilk, which is thickened with chickpea flour and seasoned with ginger, turmeric, chilies, and tempered spices. Deep-fried lumps of spiced chickpea-flour batter (pakoras) are also added. * Punjabi Lassi paneer: In the Punjab, it is traditional to prepare lassi and then extract the paneer which would then be consumed by adding water, salt and chili. Lassi paneer can also be added to potatoes and spices to make a curry which resembles scrambled eggs. Lassi paneer cannot be cut into cubes as paneer from milk can be. =Snacks= * Toasted grains: In Punjab, toasting corn and wheat grains on the Punjabi bhathi is a traditional delicacy. * Samosas. =Raita and chutney= Along with all types of main dishes chutney is also served. Sweets and desserts Gajar ka halwa, a dessert made from carrot Punjabi cuisine includes various types of desserts and Mithyai which include: * Amritsari * Kheer, dessert made of rice milk and dry fruits * Khoya * Kulfi, an ice-cream-like dessert * Malpua * Rabri * Semolina-based desserts: Halva * Sheer korma Bread Punjabis eat a variety of breads. Flatbreads and raised breads are eaten on a daily basis. Raised breads are known as khamiri roti. Sunflower and flax seeds are also added in some breads occasionally. The breads may be made of different types of flour and can be made in various ways: * Baked in the tandoor like naan, tandoori roti, kulcha, or lachha paratha * Dry baked (Indian griddle), jowar ki roti, baajre ki roti and makki ki roti (these are also smeared with white butter) * Shallow fried like paratha * Deep fried like puri, Kachori and bhatoora (a fermented dough) * Salt-rising bread: Salt rising bread is a unique bread found only in the Salt Range region of Punjab, Pakistan. Since rock salt is readily available in salt range so many people in the past made use of salt instead of yeast to leaven the bread. * Papar Herbs and spices Mortar and pestle (Old method to mix spices) Indian subcontinent based spices are used in Punjabi cuisine which are ground in the Mortar and pestle or the food processor. Beverages Punjab has a diverse range of beverages. Some are dairy-based such as lassi and butter milk. Water buffalo milk-based products are especially common around Punjab. Examples are mango lassi, mango milkshake,Mango Milkshake :Mango MilkshakeMango Milkshake : Mango Milkshake and chaas. Others are juices derived from vegetables and fruits, such as watermelon shakes, carrot juice and tamarind juice (imli ka paani). Shikanjvi and neembu paani drinks are especially preferred during the summer. Jal-jeera is also common as well. Sattu is a traditional North Indian drink which is also traditionally consumed in the Punjab. Sattu is made by roasting barley grains and then grinding them into powder, mixed with salt and turmeric and water. The local regional drinks in Punjab also include Doodh soda (milk soda) and Bantay (local soda drink) in Pakistan. Fermented foods Achar gosht, famous dish made from chicken and pickles mixture Fermented foods are common in Punjabi cuisine. Also fermented foods are added in the preparation of some dishes as well.Gobhi achar : Punjabi Mix Vegetable Pickle Recipe Mango pickle is especially famous in many villages of Punjab.Mango pickle :Mango Pickle RecipeMango Pickle recipe : Mango Pickle Recipe Cooking methods A traditional Punjabi stove (Chulla) and oven (Bharolli) Traditional and modern methods are employed for cooking Punjabi cuisine. The traditional stoves and ovens used to cook Punjabi food include: =Chullah= The traditional name of the stove in the Punjabi language is chulla.Asian Perspectives, Volume 42 (2003) University Press of Hawaii Traditional houses also have ovens (wadda chulla or band chulla) that are made from bricks, stones, and in many cases clay. Older communities in Punjab also used earth ovens (khadda chulla), but this tradition is dying out now. =Bhathi= A masonry oven is known as a bhathi. Outdoor cooking and grilling have many different types of bhathi. A bhathi is used to roast wheat or corn for which Kalsi (1992) describes as a \\"special oven with an open pan in which sand is heated to roast corn.\\"Kalsi, Sewa Singh (1992) The evolution of a sikh community in Britain: religious and social change among the sikhs of Leeds and Bradford.

Amazon. The tandoor is traditionally made of clay and is a bell-shaped oven, set into the earth and fired with wood or charcoal reaching high temperatures. According to Hayter (1992) the original versions of the tandoor \\"in the Punjab, a province in the north-west of India, were sunk neck deep in the ground\\". He further states that modern versions can also rest above the ground.Hayter, Roy (1992) Food Preparation and Cooking: Levels 1 & 2\\\\.

It increase the longevity of the food products for many months. Also in the old infrastructure smoke houses are a common occurrence that are used for smoking the meat products that increase the shelf life of the meat and also add taste in it as well. Smoked meat is known as bhaapi gosht as well. Etiquette of Punjabi dining Etiquette of eating is considered a major part of the cuisine. Every Punjabi household follows certain regional etiquette. The word etiquette has many local names depending on the particular region of Punjab. Though certain etiquette varies regionally, there are many etiquette practices that are common throughout Punjab. Communal dining is a norm in Punjabi families. Bringing and sending fresh fruits, sweets and food items as gifts to family members is a common practice in Punjab, particularly during the spring season. Food items are distributed among neighbors as well on special occasions and as a sign to show hospitality. Mango is considered a delicacy and produced widely in Punjab, and mango parties are common during the fruit's harvest season. Watermelon and radish at food stalls are shared among friends and relatives. = Major features of etiquette =  Invitation to dine  * Invitation to a meal or tea is generally distributed few days beforehand. * Denying the invitation for no major reason is considered a breach of etiquette.  Table manners  * The invited guest or elder person is given special respect and attention. * Usually the invited guest is requested to start the meal. It is considered rude if the host starts eating without taking into account the attendance of all guests. * Table setting is done before the arrival of the guests. * Family members or any occupants within one home make sure to eat together during the dinner. * If any other person is present in the vicinity then they are offered meals as a way of giving respect. It is considered rude to start eating food without asking others to participate in a meal. It is customary to offer food to anyone in your vicinity before eating. * Chewing food with one's mouth open and burping in front of others is considered rude. * In the villages of Punjab, an additional common plate is usually placed on the table for any bones left from the consumption of bone meat. Placing left overs on the floor or on the table floor is considered bad etiquette.  Eating utensil etiquette  * Punjabi families use a hybrid style of South Asian and European utensil etiquette most of the times. The bread is eaten with the hands. Rice and desserts are eaten with spoons. Soup spoons are used for consuming soup and forks are used for eating noodles. Punjabi dhaba The road side is suburban eatery centres. It is also a communal place to sit and chat. Some serve on the same concept of greasy spoon.  Punjabi Restaurants  Selection of signature dishes at New Punjab Club Punjabi cuisine has spread internationally. Notably, Punjab in London has been family-run since 1946. The restaurant is the UK's oldest North Indian restaurant. The New Punjab Club, located in Hong Kong, became the world's first Punjabi restaurant to earn One Michelin Star in 2019.

In 1864, Shimla was declared as the summer capital of British India. After independence, the city became the capital of Punjab and was later made the capital of Himachal Pradesh. It is the principal commercial, cultural and educational centre of the state. It was the capital city of British Burma (present-day Myanmar) from 1942 to 1945. Small hamlets were recorded prior to 1815 when British forces took control of the area. The climatic conditions attracted the British to establish the city in the dense forests of the Himalayas. As the summer capital, Shimla hosted many important political meetings including the Simla Accord of 1914 and the Simla Conference of 1945. After independence, the state of Himachal Pradesh came into being in 1948 as a result of the integration of 28 princely states. Even after independence, the city remained an important political centre, hosting the Simla Agreement of 1972. After the reorganisation of the state of Himachal Pradesh, the existing Mahasu district was named Shimla. Shimla is home to a number of buildings that are styled in the Tudorbethan and neo-Gothic architectures dating from the colonial era, as well as multiple temples and churches. The colonial architecture and churches, the temples, and the natural environment of the city attracts tourists. Attractions include the Viceregal Lodge, the Christ Church, the Jakhoo Temple, the Mall Road, the Ridge and Annadale which together form the city centre. The Kalka‚ÄìShimla Railway line built by the British, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is also a major tourist attraction. Owing to its steep terrain, Shimla hosts the mountain biking race MTB Himalaya, which started in 2005 and is regarded as the biggest event of its kind in South Asia. Shimla also has the largest natural ice skating rink in South Asia. Apart from being a tourism centre, the city is also an educational hub with a number of colleges and research institutions.  Etymology  Shimla city gets its name from Shyamala Mata, a fearless incarnation of the goddess Kali. The temple of the goddess is situated on Bantony Hill, near The Ridge, named Kali Bari temple. According to another version Shimla gets its name from the word 'Shyamalaya' meaning blue slate by faqir on Jakhu. But generally, the society finds the first version more believable, acceptable and reasonable. Recently the state government decided to change the city's name from Shimla to Shyamala, but seeing the negative response of public and the locals, state government dismissed the plan. History Most of the area occupied by present-day Shimla city was dense forest during the 18th century. The only civilisation was the Jakhoo temple and a few scattered houses. The area was called 'Shimla', named after a Hindu goddess, Shyamala Devi, an incarnation of Kali. The bridge connecting Shimla with Chhota Shimla, originally erected in 1829 by Stapleton Cotton, Shimla, 1850s The area of present-day Shimla was invaded and captured by Bhimsen Thapa of Nepal in 1806. The British East India Company took control of the territory as per the Sugauli Treaty after the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814‚Äì16). The Gurkha leaders were quelled by storming the fort of Malaun under the command of David Ochterlony in May 1815. In a diary entry dated 30 August 1817, the Gerard brothers, who surveyed the area, describe Shimla as \\"a middling-sized village where a fakir is situated to give water to the travellers\\". In 1819, Lieutenant Ross, the Assistant Political Agent in the Hill States, set up a wood cottage in Shimla. Three years later, his successor and the Scottish civil servant Charles Pratt Kennedy built the first pucca house in the area in 1822, near Annadale, what is now the Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly building. The accounts of the Britain-like climate started attracting several British officers to the area during the hot Indian summers. By 1826, some officers had started spending their entire vacation in Shimla. In 1827, William Amherst, the Governor-General of Bengal, visited Shimla and stayed in the Kennedy House. A year later, Stapleton Cotton, the Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in India, stayed at the same residence. During his stay, a three-mile road and a bridge were constructed near Jakhoo. In 1830, the British acquired the surrounding land from the chiefs of Keonthal and Patiala in exchange for the Rawin pargana and a portion of the Bharauli pargana. The settlement grew rapidly after this, from 30 houses in 1830 to 1,141 houses in 1881. In 1832, Shimla saw its first political meeting: between the Governor- General Lord William Bentinck and the emissaries of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. In a letter to Colonel Churchill, he wrote:Researches and Missionary Labours Among the Jews, Mohammedans, and Other Sects By Joseph Wolff, published by O. Rogers, 1837 Jakhoo temple Combermere's successor Earl Dalhousie visited Shimla in the same year. After this, the town was under Nawab (King) Kumar Ghosal of Bally, West Bengal, and saw regular visits from the Governors- General and Commanders-in-Chief of British India. A number of young British officers started visiting the area to socialise with the higher-ups; they were followed by ladies looking for marriage alliances for their relatives. Shimla thus became a hill station famous for balls, parties, and other festivities. Subsequently, residential schools for pupils from upper-class families were established nearby. By the late 1830s, the city also became a centre for theatre and art exhibitions. As the population increased, a number of bungalows were built and a big bazaar was established in the town. The Indian businessmen, mainly from Sood and Parsi communities, arrived in the area to cater to the needs of the growing European population. On 9 September 1844, the foundation of the Christ Church was laid. Subsequently, several roads were widened and the construction of the Hindustan-Tibet road with a 560-feet tunnel was taken up in 1851‚Äì52. This tunnel, now known as the Dhalli Tunnel, was started by a Major Briggs in 1850 and completed in the winter of 1851‚Äì52. The 1857 uprising caused a panic among the European residents of the town, but Shimla remained largely unaffected by the rebellion. In 1863, the Viceroy of India, John Lawrence, decided to shift the summer capital of the British Raj to Shimla. He took the trouble of moving the administration twice a year between Calcutta and this separate centre over 1,000 miles away, despite the fact that it was difficult to reach.Charles Allen, Kipling Sahib, London, Little Brown, 2007 Robert Bulwer-Lytton (Viceroy of India 1876‚Äì1880) made efforts to plan the town from 1876, when he first stayed in a rented house, but began plans for a Viceregal Lodge, later built on Observatory Hill. A fire cleared much of the area where the native Indian population lived (the \\"Upper Bazaar\\" nowadays known as the Ridge), and the planning of the eastern end to become the centre of the European town forced them to live in the Middle and Lower Bazaars on the lower terraces descending the steep slopes from the Ridge. The Upper Bazaar was cleared for a town hall, with many facilities such as library and theatre, as well as offices for police and military volunteers as well as municipal administration. During the \\"Hot Weather\\", Shimla was also the headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief, India, the head of the Indian Army, and many departments of the government. The summer capital of the regional Government of the Punjab moved from Murree, in modern-day Pakistan, to Shimla in 1876. They were joined by many of the British wives and daughters of the men who remained on the plains. Together these formed Shimla Society, which, according to Charles Allen,Kipling Sahib, London, Little Brown, 2007: p. 134 \\"was as close as British India ever came to having an upper crust.\\" This may have been helped by the fact that it was very expensive, having an ideal climate and thus being desirable, as well as having limited accommodation. British soldiers, merchants, and civil servants moved here each year to escape from the heat during summer in the Indo-Gangetic plain. The presence of many bachelors and unattached men, as well as the many women passing the hot weather there, gave Shimla a reputation for adultery, and at least gossip about adultery: as Rudyard Kipling said in a letter cited by Allen, it had a reputation for \\"frivolity, gossip, and intrigue\\". The Lower Bazaar tunnel was built in 1905 and christened Khachhar Surang. The Elysium Tunnel (now known as the Auckland Tunnel), about in length, was also built in 1905. The Simla Convention , an ambiguous treaty concerning the status of Tibet negotiated by representatives of the Republic of China, Tibet and Great Britain was signed in Simla in 1913 and 1914. At the convention a demarcation line between Tibet and the North-east region of India was proposed by Sir Henry McMahon. The line came to be known as McMahon Line and is currently the effective boundary between China and India, although its legal status is disputed by the Chinese government. Passenger train on the Kalka-Shimla Railway route The Kalka‚ÄìShimla railway line, opened in 1903, added to Shimla's accessibility and popularity. The railway route from Kalka to Shimla, with more than 806 bridges and 103 tunnels, was touted as an engineering feat and came to be known as the \\"British Jewel of the Orient\\". In 2008, it became part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site. In addition, Shimla was the capital of the undivided state of Punjab in 1871, and remained so until the construction of the new city of Chandigarh (the present-day capital of the Indian states of Punjab and Haryana). Upon the formation of the state of Himachal Pradesh in 1971, Shimla was named its capital. Entrance of the Crowborough Rest House built in 1921 After independence, the Chief Commissioner's Province of H.P. came into being on 15 April 1948 as a result of the integration of 28 petty princely states (including feudatory princes and zaildars) in the promontories of the western Himalaya, known in full as the Shimla Hills States and four Punjab southern hill states by the issue of the Himachal Pradesh (Administration) Order, 1948 under Sections 3 and 4 of the Extra-Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1947 (later renamed as the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1947 vide A.O. of 1950). The State of Bilaspur was merged in the Himachal Pradesh on 1 April 1954 by the Himachal Pradesh and Bilaspur (New State) Act, 1954. Himachal became a part C state on 26 January 1950 with the implementation of the Constitution of India and the Lt. Governor was appointed. Legislative Assembly was elected in 1952. Himachal Pradesh became a Union Territory on 1 November 1956. Following area of Punjab State namely Shimla, Kangra, Kulu and Lahul and Spiti Districts, Nalagarh tehsil of Ambala District, Lohara, Amb and Una kanungo circles, some area of Santokhgarh kanungo circle and some other specified area of Una tehsil of Hoshiarpur District besides some parts of Dhar Kalan Tehsil of Pathankot district; were merged with Himachal Pradesh on 1 November 1966 on the enactment of Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966 by the Parliament. On 18 December 1970, the State of Himachal Pradesh Act was passed by Parliament and the new state came into being on 25 January 1971. Thus Himachal emerged as the eighteenth state of the Indian Union. The Simla Agreement treaty was signed in Shimla by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, the President of Pakistan, and Indira Gandhi, the Prime Minister of India. The agreement paved the way for diplomatic recognition of Bangladesh by Pakistan. Technically the document was signed at 0040 hours in the night of 3 July; despite this official documents are dated 2 July 1972. Pre-independence structures still dot Shimla; buildings such as the former Viceregal Lodge, Assembly Chamber, Auckland House, Christ Church, Gorton Castle, Shimla Town Hall and the Gaiety Theatre are reminders of British rule in India. The original Peterhoff, another Viceregal residence, burned down in 1981. British Shimla extended about a mile and a half along the ridge between Jakhoo Hill and Prospect Hill. The central spine was the Mall Road, which ran along the length of the Ridge, with a Mall Extension southwards, closed to all carriages except those of the viceroy and his wife. Geography Shimla is on the south-western ranges of the Himalayas at . It has an average altitude of above mean sea level and extends along a ridge with seven spurs. The city stretches nearly from east to west. Shimla was built on top of seven hills: Inverarm Hill, Observatory Hill, Prospect Hill, Summer Hill, Bantony Hill, Elysium Hill and Jakhoo Hill. The highest point in Shimla is the Jakhoo hill, which is at a height of . Simla and Jutogh, 1911 map The city is a Zone IV (High Damage Risk Zone) per the Earthquake hazard zoning of India. Weak construction techniques and an increasing population pose a serious threat to the already earthquake prone region. There are no water bodies near the main city and the closest river, the Sutlej, is about away. Other rivers that flow through the Shimla district, although further from the city, are the Giri, and Pabbar (both tributaries of Yamuna). The green belt in the Shimla planning area is spread over . The main forests in and around the city are of Pine, Deodar, Oak and Rhododendron. Environmental degradation due to the increasing number of tourists every year without the infrastructure to support them has resulted in Shimla losing its popular appeal as an ecotourism spot. Another rising concern in the region are the frequent number of landslides that often take place after heavy rains. The city is situated 88 km (55 miles) northeast of Kalka, 116 km (72 miles) northeast of Chandigarh, 247 km (154 miles) south of Manali and 350 km (219 miles) northeast of Delhi, the national capital. Kalka can be reached within 2.5 hours, Chandigarh can be reached in 3 hours and 15 minutes. Delhi and Manali are both around 7 hours away from Shimla. Climate Shimla features a subtropical highland climate (Cwb) under the K√∂ppen climate classification. The climate in Shimla is predominantly cool during winters and moderately warm during summer. Temperatures typically range from to over the course of a year. The average temperature during summer is between , and between in winter. Monthly precipitation varies between in November and in August. It is typically around per month during winter and spring, and around in June as the monsoon approaches. The average total annual precipitation is , which is much less than most other hill stations but still much heavier than on the plains. Snowfall in the region, which historically has taken place in the month of December, has lately (over the last fifteen years) been happening in January or early February every year. The maximum snowfall received in recent times was on 18 January 2013. On two consecutive days (17 and 18 January 2013), the town received of snow.  Economy  Shimla's \\"Lower Bazaar\\" in a photograph taken between 1887 and 1889 Employment is largely driven by the government and tourism sectors. Education sector and horticultural produce processing comprise most of the remainder. Recently a Model Career Centre has been set-up at Regional Employment Exchange, Shimla to enable bridging the gap between job-seekers and employers. In addition to being the local hub of transport and trade, Shimla is the area's healthcare centre, hosting a medical college and four major hospitals: Indira Gandhi Hospital (Snowdown Hospital,) Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital (formerly called Ripon Hospital), Kamla Nehru Hospital and Indus Hospital. The city's development plan aims to make Shimla an attractive health tourism spot. The hotel industry is one of the major sources of income generation for the city. Shimla has up to 6500 hotels, including 5-star hotels, most popular is Oberoi Cecil, Peterhoff, Wildflower Hall and Hotel Holiday Home. Shimla leads the list of Indian cities with the highest-ranked hotels. National Academy of Audits and Accounts, Yarrows Along with schools of higher education, several institutes are also present, namely Himachal Pradesh University and Indian Institute of Advanced Study. Recruitment to the IAAS is through the joint competitive examinations (the Civil Services Examination) and through promotion from the subordinate cadre. Once recruited to IAAS, the directly recruited officers are trained mainly at the National Academy of Audit and Accounts, Shimla. Students from across India prefer to study in Shimla because of its climate and Queen of Hill Stations status. These have added to the economy of the district as well as the state. Government is trying to promote technology and IT sector as the new area for growth and promotion although not many companies have yet settled in Shimla. There are many new startups in and around Shimla. There are over six call centres in Shimla, including Altruist Technologies and 31 Parallel. Two notable companies that are registered in Shimla are Netgen IT Solutions, an international website development startup with partner offices in the US and Australia, and Himachal Media, a company that deals with content and media publishing. Civic administration Town Hall as seen from The Ridge The administrative responsibilities of the city of Shimla and merged areas of Dhalli, Totu, and New Shimla reside with the Shimla Municipal Corporation (SMC). All three areas were taken under SMC in 2006‚Äì07. Established in 1851, the Shimla Municipal Corporation is an elected body comprising 27 councillors, three of whom are nominated by the government of Himachal Pradesh. The nominations are based on prominence in the fields of social service, academics, and other activities. Thirty-three percent of the seats are reserved for women. The elections take place every five years and the mayor and deputy mayor are elected by and amongst the councillors themselves. Kusum Sadrate and Rakesh Kumar Sharma of BJP are the present mayor and deputy mayor respectively.Kusum Sadret: BJP gets its first mayor in Shimla The administrative head of the corporation is the commissioner who is appointed by the state government. The two major political parties are the Bharatiya Janata Party and Indian National Congress with a third party, Communist Party of India (Marxist), emerging. The city contributes one seat to the state assembly (Vidhan Sabha) and one seat to the lower house of parliament (Lok Sabha). Law and order in the city is collectively maintained by the Police Force, Vigilance Department, enforcement directorate, forensics, fire brigade, prisons service and Home Guard. There are five police stations and three fire stations in Shimla. The Superintendent of Police, Shimla heads the police force. The First Armed Police Battalion, one of the four armed police battalions in the state, is available for assistance to the local police. There are eleven courts in the district including a fast-track court. Demographics =Population= According to 2011 census, Shimla city spread over an area of 35.34 km2 had a population of 169,578 with 93,152 males and 76,426 females. Shimla urban agglomeration had a population of 171,817 as per provisional data of 2011 census, out of which males were 94,797 and females were 77,020. The effective literacy rate of city was 93.63 percent and that of urban agglomeration was 94.14 per cent. The city area has increased considerably along with the passage of time. It has stretched from Hiranagar to Dhalli from one side & from Tara Devi to Malyana in the other. As per the 2001 India Census, the city has a population of 142,161 spread over an area of 19.55 km¬≤. A floating population of 75,000 is attributed to service industries such as tourism. The largest demographic, 55%, is 16‚Äì45 years of age. A further 28% of the population is younger than 15 years. The low sex ratio ‚Äì 930 girls for every 1,000 boys in 2001Missing: Mapping the Adverse Child Sex Ratio in India, UNFPA 2003 ‚Äì is cause for concern, and much lower than the 974 versus 1,000 for Himachal Pradesh state as a whole.

The tradition is thought to have originated either in the Netherlands or in the British Isles and later became common in colonial United States,History of Sex, Love and Sexuality 1750 America and Bundling, The People's Almanac 1975 - 1981 especially in Pennsylvania Dutch Country. Some Nebraska Amish may still practice it. When used for courtship, the aim is to allow intimacy without sexual intercourse. Origin It is possible the precedent for bundling came from the biblical story of Ruth and Boaz, in which Ruth, a widow, and Boaz, a wealthy landowner, spend a night together in a grain storage room. Tradition says they did not touch, and the pair later got married. Courtship practice Traditionally, participants were adolescents, with a boy staying at the residence of the girl. They were given separate blankets by the girl's parents and expected to talk to one another through the night. Occasionally a bundling board or bundling sack was placed between the boy and girl to discourage sexual conduct.  In United States  In Colonial United States, Jonathan Edwards and other preachers condemned bundling. It is possible that, as late as the mid-19th century, bundling was still practiced in New York state and perhaps in New England, though its popularity was waning. The court case of Graham v. Smith, 1 Edm.Sel.Cas. 267 (N.Y. 1846), for example, initially argued before Judge Edmunds in the Orange Circuit Court of New York, concerned the seduction of a 19-year-old woman; testimony in the case established that bundling was a common practice in certain rural social circles at the time. By the 20th century, bundling seems to have disappeared almost everywhere, except for the more conservative Old Order Amish affiliations, where it is still in use in the 21st century, regardless of location.Shachtman, pp. 10 Literature The writer Washington Irving, in chapter 7 of A History of New York (1809) as well as other of his works, refers to bundling as a Yankee practice. > This amazing increase may, indeed, be partly ascribed to a singular custom > prevalent among them, commonly known by the name of bundling‚Äîa superstitious > rite observed by the young people of both sexes, with which they usually > terminated their festivities, and which was kept up with religious > strictness by the more bigoted part of the community. In the media Gabriel Edward Martin, Heath Ledger's character in the 2000 film The Patriot, is bundled when he spends an overnight visit at the home of Anne Patricia Howard (Lisa Brenner), the girl that he is courting. Anna Gunn's character in the HBO series Deadwood mentions removing a bundling board from their bed in Season 2, Episode 2. In the TV series Salem during Season 1, Episode 7, \\"Our Own Private America\\", adolescent teens are seen bundling. The girl breaks the sack. In the TV series A Discovery of Witches during Season 1, episode 5, Matthew de Clairmont and Diana Bishop discuss the \\"bundling\\" custom.

Records. It was recorded from the end of 1995 through early 1996, shortly after the death of Wax Trax! co- founder and band friend Jim Nash. Xtort features a variety of guest artists from the industrial music scene and studio musicians from other genres, but includes limited participation from core member En Esch. The album was massively promoted by KMFDM's American label TVT Records, which pressed tens of thousands of copies of its lead single \\"Power\\". Frontman Sascha Konietzko created his own form of promotion, issuing a press release that both disparaged and lauded the coming set. Xtort was generally well-received by critics, with many calling it superlative, and is the highest-charting KMFDM album to date. After the original release went out of print, a remastered version was released in 2007. Background In late 1995, KMFDM had completed the \\"Beat by Beat\\" and \\"In Your Face\\" tours in support of their last album, Nihil. KMFDM frontman and founder Sascha Konietzko described Nihil as \\"the crown\\", and said the band had come as close to mainstream popularity as he wanted. He felt the band needed to move away from its success. In 2007, Konietzko recalled that he had \\"hated all the attention, interviews, photo shoots, etc.\\". After the tours, Konietzko returned to Chicago in order to be with his friend Jim Nash, co-founder of Wax Trax! Records, who was dying from AIDS. Konietzko referred to the death of Nash that October as \\"the end of an era\\". En Esch, one of the longtime core members of KMFDM, had almost nothing to do with Xtort, contributing to just two songs. With regard to Esch's lack of participation, Konietzko said, \\"En Esch is just En Esch. He never made himself available to do this album, and so it's always my belief that the thing must keep moving; I had to do it without him.\\" He also said the two were not in communication around the time of the album's release. Production Xtort was pre-produced and tracked in Seattle at Hole in the Wall Studio, and recorded and mixed in Chicago at Chicago Recording Company. Konietzko contacted F. M. Einheit and had him come to Chicago in January 1996 to work on some tracks together. Konietzko also brought in a number of Wax Trax! alumni, such as Chris Connelly of Revolting Cocks and Bill Rieflin of Ministry, to help with the album's creation, along with assistance from more than a dozen studio musicians. Konietzko required all the album's contributors to be on call thirteen hours a day during production, saying \\"I don't care what they do on their own time, but when they do KMFDM, if they don't comply with the schedule, they're out.\\" Konietzko said the ideas for songs began with individual sounds, which he then modified until he created a looped rhythm. \\"Craze\\", for example, Konietzko called \\"an homage to Atari Teenage Riot, a band with two guys, one girl, a couple TR90S drum machines and a bass machine.\\" He said he was inspired by touring with the band in Europe in support of Nihil in 1995. After creating the base tunes, the songs went to G√ºnter Schulz, another longtime member, to add guitars. With the completed songs, Konietzko then allowed guest artists, such as Connelly, to pick songs they wanted to contribute to, and added their vocals or other instrumentation. For Xtort, Konietzko used Macintosh products to do all the synchronization. Connelly contributed to four tracks, including \\"Blame\\", which also featured the horn section from the Oakland, California based group Tower of Power. Nicole Blackman, KMFDM's publicist at the time, contributed spoken word vocals to the track \\"Dogma\\", which was adapted from the ten-minute live performance she provided while touring with the band. \\"Power\\", meanwhile, was made to fulfill a request by the band's label, Wax Trax!, for a radio promo song. Konietzko said he'd heard \\"radio didn't like big female choruses\\", so he got voiceover commercial singer Cheryl Wilson to help with the song, which he called \\"dumb and catchy\\". The hidden track of the album, \\"Fairy\\", is a story narrated by Jr. Blackmail, who had worked with the band previously in the 1980s. Konietzko said it was inspired by Blackmail's \\"dirty fantasies\\". He also said it was not a serious track: \\"it was more like kids at play\\". For the background sounds, the group did things like roll screws on the floor while Schulz played piano. Release The first track on the album, \\"Power\\", was featured on the \\"Wax Trax! Summer Swindle\\", a cassette sampler included with 45,000 issues of the July 1996 issue of Alternative Press. Another 50,000 copies of the sampler were to be handed out at summer college and beach events and given away at radio stations. 90,000 pre-release posters and information sheets were mailed out to fans. The character Son of a Gun from the video of the same name. Blackman wrote the promotional piece for the album's press kit, and at Konietzko's request, wrote the first half of the promo as an insulting take down of the album rather than as a standard promo. The first letter of each line of the first section of the promo spelled out the phrase \\"April Fools Day Fucker\\" and included lines such as \\"It's been 100 years and fifty albums for the German/American rock squad‚Äîare they running out of gas or what?\\" and \\"KMFDM can't suck hard enough\\", a quote from the track \\"Inane\\". The second half of the promo included phrases such as \\"XTORT is a supersonic soundtrack\\" and \\"The new album is the sound of a band at the height of their powers.\\" Carrie Borzillo of Billboard stated KMFDM was \\"poised to make a significant commercial breakthrough.\\" Konietzko said at the time there were no plans to tour in support of the album's release. He later said this was due to the fact that the band as a touring unit had ceased to exist. Xtort was released on June 25, 1996 on Wax Trax!/TVT on cassette, CD, and vinyl. The album was also released in CD format in Europe and Japan. In addition to being the first KMFDM album to chart in the Billboard 200, staying there for three weeks and peaking at No. 92 the week of July 13, 1996, Xtort sold over 200,000 copies, making it one of the band's best-selling albums. The song \\"Son of a Gun\\" was made into an animated video by visual artist Aidan \\"Brute!\\" Hughes, who also did the album's cover artwork. On March 6, 2007, Metropolis Records released a digitally remastered version of the album on CD and MP3. Looking back on the album at the time of its re-release, Konietzko said it was his favorite album of the 1990s. Critical reception Reviews for Xtort were almost universally positive. Jon Wiederhorn of Entertainment Weekly called it \\"the heaviest and most danceable disc in [KMFDM's] 12-year career\\" while giving it an A-. Heidi MacDonald of CMJ New Music Monthly compared Xtort to getting hit with a wrecking ball, saying, \\"When KMFDM does what it does best, it is the best at what it does, namely jack-hammer industrial anthems that hit with stunning precision and power.\\" Sandy Masuo of Rolling Stone called the album \\"the product of a first-rate lineup,\\" and praised the album's diversity, saying, \\"The 10 tracks on Xtort are grounded in KMFDM's smart synthesis of metallic crunch, swiveling rhythms and sophisticated electronics, but it's the organic elements that give the album a zesty twist.\\" Kevin M. Williams of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the album an \\"essential\\" rating, and said, \\"KMFDM has some major mojo working with Xtort\\".Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic was less enthusiastic, saying, \\"it would be nice to hear [KMFDM] branch out and start to experiment a little bit more\\", and commenting that while Xtort did not sound much different from previous releases, \\"KMFDM sounds as good as they ever have, and several tracks rank among their best.\\" Liz Armstrong of the Daily Herald thought the guest contributors added significant differences to their individual songs. Larry Flick of Billboard said \\"Power\\", the opening track, \\"finds front man Sascha Konietzko snarling and growling with palpable force, while Cheryl Wilson softens the edges with splashes of soul-mama vamping during the chorus.\\" Williams called the song \\"irresistible\\". Masuo noted in particular the use of horns and the Hammond B3 organ, and concluded by stating, \\"In their insidiously arty and intellectually sassy music, KMFDM continue to bring diverse elements together to create a unified whole.\\" Armstrong called \\"Dogma\\" a song that crossed over from being industrial to \\"frightening\\", while MacDonald described it as \\"blistering\\" and Williams said it was \\"captivating\\". Armstrong said \\"Son of a Gun\\" was the album's \\"truly explosive track\\", but Williams thought \\"Inane\\" was the best song. Track listing All information from 2007 release CD booklet.

The franchise consists of several role-playing video games and related media. Since the launch of the original Wild Arms title in 1996, the series has gone on to encompass several media, including toys, manga, mobile phone applications, and a 22-episode anime. The series has largely been overseen by producer Akifumi Kaneko and is viewed as a cult classic among other role-playing game franchises. Wild Arms is part of Sony's first-party \\"Three Major RPGs\\" along with Arc The Lad and Popolocrois in Japan. Series development = Production = Wild Arms was the first role-playing video game project of Media.Vision that had been known primarily for their shooter game series Crime Crackers and Rapid Reload. Looking for a way to capitalize on the growing role-playing game market of the mid-nineties, Sony commissioned Media.Vision to create a game that would combine elements of a traditional RPG with limited 3D graphics to promote the hardware of their newly released PlayStation console. Supervised and designed primarily by Akifumi Kaneko and Takashi Fukushima, 1996's Wild Arms, while still retaining traditional two-dimensional characters and backgrounds, became one of the first role-playing titles released to showcase 3D battle sequences. Drawing inspiration from western-themed manga such as Yasuhiro Nightow's Trigun, Kaneko and Fukushima crafted a video game world that resembles the contemporary fantasy environment seen in similar titles. References to seminal role-playing game elements influenced by European fantasy such as castles, magic, dragons, and monsters, were added to attract players to a familiar concept, as well as allow scenario writers from other projects. Other cultural and regional influences include Norse mythology, animism, and Japanese mythology. =Music= The background music of Wild Arms is reminiscent of Western films. The groundwork for the series' music was laid by composer Michiko Naruke, who had previously only written the scores to Super Nintendo Entertainment System titles. Recurring instrumentation includes acoustic guitars, mandolins, drums, woodwind and brass instruments, and pianos, accompanied by clapping and whistling samples. While classically influenced, the music of each game often diverges into other genres, including folk, rock, electronic, swing, and choral. Naruke composed the soundtracks for the first three Wild Arms titles herself, yet she contributed to the soundtrack for Wild Arms 4 along with Nobuyuki Shimizu, Ryuta Suzuki, and Masato Kouda, who emulated her now-established style. Music for Wild Arms 5, the only video game title where Naruke did not contribute, was provided by Kouda along with series newcomer Noriyasu Agematsu. Recurring themes Wild Arms Alter Code: F. The usage of firearms factors heavily into the Wild Arms mythos. Called \\"ARMs\\", these weapons are often associated with ancient technology and represent a more violent and warlike age; thus, a social stigma is often given to anyone possessing or using them.Townsperson: I know about you. You possess the [ARM]. The forbidden power! Though the exact nature varies from one game to the next, they are seen as highly destructive devices with an array of functions in battle. The practical usage of ARMs, either to protect or destroy life, is left to the user's discretion, and serves as a plot point within each game to establish a character's true motives.Virginia: My father disappeared into the wasteland, but one thing he taught me was the ability to handle ARMs. If there's anybody out there--out there in the vast wasteland needing my help, I want to have wings so that I can fly right to them. Jude: \\"That guy...He referred to my ARM as the 'power that sparked and fueled a war'... Weapons such as ARMs are responsible for what happened to places like Ciel and that other town, aren't they...? Maybe my power really can't protect anything...\\" / Raquel: \\"Remember when I told you that there are both good and bad Drifters? And that I wanted to be a good Drifter?\\" / Jude: \\"Yeah...\\" / Raquel: \\"Well, it's the same for you. You just need to focus on using your power for good, that's all.\\" Environmentalism is also a key factor in many Wild Arms games, which often center around the restoration of the environment that has long since been tainted, either by warfare or natural phenomena. The governing forces of the planet are personified as \\"Guardians\\", spirit-like anthropomorphic creatures who act as the gods of natural aspects such as water, fire, and wind, along with human traits such as love, hope, and courage. The primary heroes of each game often ally themselves with these Guardians to defeat technology-reliant or ecologically unconscious villains who would either subjugate or destroy the world to suit their respective goals.Guardian Gurdijeff: Warriors! Do you still seek our power?! / Cecilia: We can't possibly do this ourselves... / Jack: I want the power... I want to defeat them... / Gurdijeff: Because you are weak, you seek power... We shall give you the power that you seek, but time is running out. (Wild Arms)Irving: That's right. Contact the mystical Guardians who protect the world, and they may also aid us in battle. We have finally discovered the key to contacting them. =Setting= Each Wild Arms story takes place on a planet called Filgaia, though each \\"Filgaia\\" appears to be an entirely separate world with a different arrangement of continents, in similar tradition to the discontinuity between games of the Final Fantasy series. Filgaia is a fantasy world containing a variety of terrain, including deserts, red rock canyons, plains, forests, mountainous regions, grasslands, and Arctic tundras, though their predominance varies from one game to the next. Though human towns and cities are plentiful, the wilderness that encompasses most of the landscape is riddled with monsters and other beasts, as well as ruins or dungeons from earlier eras that house ancient treasures inaccessible to all but skilled adventurers. Filgaia is also home to a number of different races including the Native American-inspired Baskars, nature-dwelling Elws, and vampiric Crimson Nobles. =Elw= The Elw (pronounced el-loo) are a demi-human race who appear human, with the exception of their long ears. Because of their close relationship with nature, the Elw live exceptionally long lives. Due to the destruction of the environment, the Elw population is extremely low. The Elw were the original inhabitants of Filgaia. When the neosapiens (humans) migrated to Filgaia after a war on their home world, the Elw kindly accepted them. Around a thousand years before the events of Wild Arms, Filgaia was invaded by a race known as the Metal Demons. The Elw joined together with the other inhabitants of Filgaia, the humans and Guardians, in order to expel the invaders. Eventually, the Metal Demon leader \\"Mother\\" was defeated and the Metal Demons were pushed back to the northernmost part of Filgaia. During the war, the Elw developed many weapons using their knowledge of magic, alchemy, and technology. Most of these weapons later became known as ARMs. The Elw also created the large humanoid machines called Golems. The Golems proved very useful during the first Demon War. However, the Golems were unreliable because they determined friend and foe based on whoever was operating them. This flaw was later exploited by the Metal Demons during the second Demon War and was the main reason the Elws created the Holmcross. The Elw created the Holmcross using living metal based on the Metal Demons'. The Holmcross went on a rampage, and all but one were destroyed by the Elw. The final weapon the Elw created was the Guardian Blade. When the Guardian Blade was activated, it sucked the vitality out of part of the planet and started the decay that would slowly turn Filgaia into a barren wasteland that would soon be impossible for the Elw, who were dependent on nature, to live on. This and the Elw distrust of humans led to the creation of the Elw Dimension and the Elw's evacuation of Filgaia. The last known Elw founded Baskar village. =Ragu O Ragula= A recurring optional boss enemy throughout the series is the legendary Ragu O Ragula, known as the \\"King of the Monsters\\". He is strongly hinted at being an alien lifeform, as he has \\"traveled the stars\\". In each Wild ARMs game, he is the ultimate extra boss. In games in which the Abyss ‚Äî a sometimes ridiculously long optional dungeon that appears in many of the games ‚Äî is present, he will be at the end of that dungeon. The player is not often given many clues to find him, but he is always alluded to in a few bookshelves throughout the game. When defeated, Ragu usually bestows upon the player the iconic Sheriff Star accessory, which not only proves the player's valor, but also tends to make the remainder of the game quite easy when equipped due to its effects. This trend was broken in Wild Arms 5, in which when defeated, Ragu drops a badge called \\"The Omega\\". Series overview = Games = As a Sony franchise, all Wild Arms video games appear exclusively on PlayStation video game consoles. Each individual title is set in the world of Filgaia and contains several consistencies that have become series mainstays, including similar races, monsters, technologies, and plot points. However, only two of the titles directly allude to any chronology, as each game bears a Filgaia unrecognizable from each prior title. * Wild Arms established many of the recurring themes seen in later installments, including the desert world of Filgaia, and gun-like machinery called \\"ARMs\\". It introduced the \\"tool\\" system, in which special items such as bombs or grappling hooks can be used out of combat to cross otherwise impassable terrain and destroy objects. Originally released in Japan for the PlayStation in 1996, the game was published in North America and the PAL region over the next two years by Sony Computer Entertainment. Wild Arms features two-dimensional characters and environments for normal gameplay, while battle sequences are instead rendered in full 3D. The game follows the adventures of a band of \\"Dream Chasers\\", Rudy, Jack, and Cecilia, as they make their way across the desert-like world of Filgaia. Contacted by the Avatars of the forces of nature that protect the world, the heroes are chosen to be humankind's champions in the face of a demon invasion. * Wild Arms 2, the sequel to the first Wild Arms, was the second and final title for the original PlayStation. While keeping many of the themes from the previous title, Wild Arms 2 introduced additional science fiction elements, including more abundant high technology and cybernetics, with additional fantasy and steampunk themes. A total of six characters can be recruited, with the player able to switch between any of them at any time. While characters remained in 2D, environments such as dungeons and towns were now rendered in isometric 3D. Wild Arms 2 involves a group of international peace-keepers known as \\"Operation ARMS\\" that are assigned by a wealthy benefactor to protect the world from the terrorist organization Odessa. The player assumes control of each member of ARMS as they make their way through the game, and eventually confront an ancient evil that once threatened to destroy all of Filgaia. * Wild Arms 3 is the first Wild Arms game for the PlayStation 2 console and the first title to be presented entirely using 3D cel-shaded graphics. Though combat remains turn-based, a minor addition to the battle system, the \\"crossfire sequence\\", gives the appearance that characters and enemies are moving around the battlefield between rounds. The game takes place on a desert world almost totally devoid of large bodies of water, where roving bands of adventurers and outlaws roam the land in search of vast fortune, either through robberies or treasure hunting. Four strangers united by circumstance, Virginia, Jet, Clive and Gallows are the main characters who must confront a group of mystics trying to revive the world, and a demon who would have it destroyed. *Wild Arms Alter Code: F was released for the PlayStation 2 as an enhanced remake of the original Wild Arms, it featured an expanded script, additional story sequences, and a re-recorded soundtrack by Naruke. While all the previous locations from the initial version return, they are now presented in full 3D with new layouts and puzzles. New gameplay additions from Wild Arms 3 include the Migrant System for avoiding battles, and the Crossfire Sequence added to combat. * Wild Arms 4 takes a more action game-like approach to the series, including environments that only allow horizontal movement, and the ability to run, jump, and slide past obstacles. The tool system is absent for the first time, and combat sequences are handled dramatically different from previous games. Utilizing the \\"Hex System\\", battlefields are now made up of seven equally-sized hexagons that characters may move between each combat round, allowing the player to attack enemies or aid allies stationed in adjacent hexes. The story follows the journey of Jude, a young boy from an isolated village who is the unwilling owner of a secretly- developed ARM weapon and now on the run from the government. He is joined by his companions Yulie, Arnaud, and Raquel as they embark on a quest to re-unite Jude with his mother, as well as defeat a number of superhuman government agents with a hidden plot involving the safety of the world. * Wild Arms 5, the final title for the PlayStation 2, makes further use of Wild Arms 4's HEX combat system with minor adjustments, including a combat party of no more than three characters. Released in Japan in December 2006, the game was released in North America by XSEED Games in August 2007. A PAL-region version was published by 505 Games in limited quantities only available in France, Italy and the UK. The story concerns Dean Stark, a 16-year-old adventurer from a village specializing in collecting lost technology, and his friend Rebecca who discover a mysterious amnesiac young woman named Avril outside town. The duo agrees to help Avril in her quest to recover her memory, while Dean commits himself to learning how to use ARMs so he may one day become a successful \\"Golem Hunter\\", a finder of ancient robotic giants. * Wild Arms XF is the series' first handheld title, developed for the PlayStation Portable. Unlike the other titles, it is a tactical role-playing game. The story centers around Clarissa Arwin, the leader of the Chevalet Blanc knights, who is swept up into a political war when she travels to the Kingdom of Elesius to retrieve her mother's sword. =Mobile= Wild Arms Mobile is a series of flash-based mobile phone games distributed by Yahoo! Keitai, I-Mode, and EZWeb for the NTT DoCoMo cellphone brand in Japan. First developed in 2006, the download-to-play service includes two Wild Arms-themed minigames: a Tetris-style puzzle game, and Wild Arms K≈çya no Nich≈ç Kenj≈´, a shooting game featuring characters and locations from Wild Arms 3. Additional downloadable features include backgrounds, calendar skins, music, and visual styles based on several Wild Arms games. A routine news feed can also be accessed with information from Sony Computer Entertainment. Wild Arms: Million Memories was released for smart phones in Japan on September 26, 2018. The game was developed by ForwardWorks and features characters from various different Wild Arms games. =Manga= Cover to the Wild Arms Flower Thieves manga collection. First appearing in the Japanese Magazine Z in 2001, Wild Arms Hana Nusubito, or Wild ARMs: Flower Thieves, is a 187-page manga commissioned by Sony Computer Entertainment Japan published by Kodansha. The manga features artwork by Wakako ≈åba and contains plot elements from the first two Wild Arms titles, though it is set in its own unique world. Flower Thieves takes place thousands of years after a war between humans and demons destroyed much of the life on the planet, turning the world into a scorched wasteland. Set in a dystopian future, the manga features a large group of humans on their last legs, living in the overcrowded city of Upper Hose where flowers and other flora are rare and valuable. When a plant-eating monster known as a \\"Flower Thief\\" attacks a mysterious girl named Jechika, a young boy, Maxi, must use a forbidden ARM weapon to save her, and is subsequently expelled from the city for using illegal technology. Traveling into the wilderness with Jechika and a florist named Gi, Maxi sets off on a quest to restore the balance of nature throughout the world and make the earth habitable again. Beginning with Wild Arms 2 in 1999, official adaptations of each Wild Arms game were produced by such manga companies as DNA Media, Enix, Bros. Comics, GanGan Wing, and 4Kings for release exclusively in Japan. Each work follows the plot of each game it is based on, with minor interpretations to the original script and characters. =Anime= Wild Arms: Twilight Venom is a 22-episode anime series originally broadcast on Japan's WOWOW network from October 1999 to March 2000 produced by Studio Bee Train. Directed by Itsuro Kawasaki and K≈çichi Mashimo, the series follows the adventures of two treasure hunters - Loretta, an aspiring sorceress and Mirabelle, a Crimson Noble - who stumble upon the body of Sheyenne Rainstorm, a warrior from the past reborn as a 10-year-old boy. Able to use the archaic yet powerful ARM devices found with him, Sheyenne and the others team up with gung-ho scientist Dr. Aronnax to discover the secret of his past. The series features music by Kow Otani and Sho Wada, as well as themes from the first two Wild Arms games. =Albums= Alone the World. In addition to commercial soundtracks for each individual game and the anime, two sets of arranged albums have been released featuring music from multiple games in the Wild Arms series. The compilation album Alone the World: Wild Arms Vocal Collection, released in July 2002, features all vocal tracks from the first three Wild Arms titles, as well as sung versions of previously instrumental songs provided by Kaori Asoh. In celebration of the Wild Arms series 10th anniversary, Media.Vision and King Records produced two separate albums under the Wild Arms: Music the Best label which feature music from the first four Wild Arms games as well as the Twilight Venom anime. The first album, Feeling Wind, released August 2006, contains piano interpretations of various songs performed by Haruki Mino and Fumito Hirata and arranged by Yasuo Sako, and came packaged with a special edition songbook entitled Piece of Tears featuring linear notes for each track as well as interviews with long- time series composer Michiko Naruke. The second album, Rocking Heart, released the following October, is a rock and jazz-inspired remix album featuring arrangements by Nittoku Inoue, Nobuhiko Kashiwara, Nao Tokisawa, Atsushi Tomita, Transquillo, and Ryo Yonemitsu. Reception While some critics praise Wild Arms for its unique approach to storytelling, others denounce that it is at best a \\"filler\\" series meant to fill gaps between releases of other, more prominent titles. Each Wild Arms game has sold modestly in North America and Europe, with no titles selling above the requisite amount to qualify for a \\"PlayStation Greatest Hits\\" or \\"Sony Platinum Range\\" distinction. Sales in Japan have been significantly better, with the first five titles obtaining the equivalent \\"PlayStation the Best\\" or \\"PlayStation 2 the Best\\" distinction as well as reprints several months or years after their original release. With the exception of Wild Arms 2 and Alter Code: F, each game has been released in the three major NTSC and PAL regions.

It is most closely related to property law, and is distinct from laws governing water quality.  Waters subject to regulation  Water is ubiquitous and does not respect political boundaries. Water resources laws may apply to any portion of the hydrosphere over which claims may be made to appropriate or maintain the water to serve some purpose. Such waters include, but are not limited to: *Surface waters - lakes, rivers, streams, oceans, and wetlands; *Surface runoff‚Äîgenerally water that flows across the land from rain, floodwaters, and snowmelt before those waters reach watercourses, lakes, wetlands, or oceans; *Groundwater, particularly water present in aquifers. History The history of people's relation to water illustrates varied approaches to the management of water resources. \\"Lipit Ishtar and Ur Nammu both contain water provisions, pre-date Hammurabi by at least 250 years, and clearly provide the normative underpinnings on which the Hammurabi Code was constructed.\\" The Code of Hammurabi was one of the earliest written laws to deal with water issues, and this code included the administration of water use. The code was developed about 3,800 years ago by King Hammurabi of Babylonia.Jones, P. Andrew, and Cech, Tom. Colorado Water Law for Non-Lawyers. Boulder, CO, USA: University Press of Colorado, 2009. Difficulties of water rights Water is uniquely difficult to regulate, because laws are designed mainly for land. Water is mobile, its supply varies by year, season, and location, and it can be used simultaneously by many entities. As with property law, water rights can be described as a \\"bundle of sticks\\" containing multiple, separable activities that can have varying levels of regulation. For instance, some uses of water divert it from its natural course but return most or all of it (e.g. hydroelectric plants), while others consume much of what they take (ice, agriculture), and still others use water without diverting it at all (e.g. boating). Each type of activity has its own needs and can in theory be regulated separately. There are several types of conflict likely to arise: absolute shortages; shortages in a particular time or place, diversions of water that reduce the flow available to others, pollutants or other changes (such as temperature or turbidity) that render water unfit for others' use, and the need to maintain \\"in-stream flows\\" of water to protect the natural ecosystem. One theory of history, put forward in Karl August Wittfogel's book Oriental Despotism: A Comparative Study of Total Power, holds that many empires were organized around a central authority that controlled a population through monopolizing the water supply. Such a hydraulic empire creates the potential for despotism, and serves as a cautionary tale for designing water regulations. Water law involves controversy in some parts of the world where a growing population faces increasing competition over a limited natural supply. Disputes over rivers, lakes and underground aquifers cross national borders. Although water law is still regulated mainly by individual countries, there are international sets of proposed rules such as the Helsinki Rules on the Uses of the Waters of International Rivers and the Hague Declaration on Water Security in the 21st Century. Long-term issues in water law include the possible effects of global warming on rainfall patterns and evaporation; the availability and cost of desalination technology; the control of pollution, and the growth of aquaculture.  Legal models  The legal right to use a designated water supply is known as a water right. There are two major models used for water rights. The first is riparian rights, where the owner of the adjacent land has the right to the water in the body next to it. The other major model is the prior appropriations model, the first party to make use of a water supply has the first rights to it, regardless of whether the property is near the water source. Riparian systems are generally more common in areas where water is plentiful, while appropriations systems are more common in dry climates. As water resource law is complex, many areas have a combination of the two models. Water law by country = International law = The right to use water to satisfy basic human needs for personal and domestic uses has been protected under international human rights law. When incorporated in national legal frameworks, this right is articulated to other water rights within the broader body of water law. The human right to water has been recognized in international law through a wide range of international documents, including international human rights treaties, declarations and other standards. The human right to water places the main responsibilities upon governments to ensure that people can enjoy \\"sufficient, safe, accessible and affordable water, without discrimination\\". Most especially, governments are expected to take reasonable steps to avoid a contaminated water supply and to ensure there are no water access distinctions amongst citizens. Today all states have at least ratified one human rights convention which explicitly or implicitly recognizes the right, and they all have signed at least one political declaration recognizing this right. =Canada= Under the Constitution Act, 1867, jurisdiction over waterways is divided between the federal and provincial governments. Federal jurisdiction is derived from the powers to regulate navigation and shipping, fisheries, and the governing of the northern territories, which has resulted in the passage of: :* the Fisheries Act, :* the Navigation Protection Act, :* the Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act, and :* the Oceans Act. Provincial jurisdiction is derived from the powers over property and civil rights, matters of a local and private nature, and management of Crown lands. In Ontario, Quebec and other provinces, the beds of all navigable waters are vested in the Crown, in contrast to English law.See ' in Ontario and Civil Code of Quebec, s. 919, in Quebec All provincial governments also govern water quality through laws on environmental protection and drinking water, such as the Clean Water Act in Ontario. =Australia= Water law in Australia varies with each state. Tasmania A newly formed Tasmanian Water Corporation has compulsorily acquired all drinking water supply infrastructure without payment and does not have direct accountability Flora Fox Regional News, Kingborough, Hobart Southern Tasmania =Water law in the United States= In the United States there are complex legal systems for allocating water rights that vary by region. These varying systems exist for both historical and geographic reasons. Water law encompasses a broad array of subjects or categories designed to provide a framework to resolve disputes and policy issues relating to water: *Public waters, including tidal waters and navigable waterways. *Other surface waters‚Äîgenerally water that flows across non-public land from rain, floodwaters, and snowmelt before those waters reach public watercourses. *Groundwater, sometimes called subterranean, percolating, or underground water *Public regulation of waters, including flood control, environmental regulation‚Äîstate and federal, public health regulation and regulation of fisheries *Related to all of the above is interplay of public and private rights in water, which draws on aspects of eminent domain law and the federal commerce clause powers *Water project law: the highly developed law regarding the formation, operation, and finance of public and quasi-public entities which operate local public works of flood control, navigation control, irrigation, and avoidance of environmental degradation *Treaty Rights of Native Americans The law governing these topics comes from all layers of law. Some derives from common law principles which have developed over centuries, and which evolve as the nature of disputes presented to courts change. For example, the judicial approach to landowner rights to divert surface waters has changed significantly in the last century as public attitudes about land and water have evolved. Some derives from state statutory law. Some derives from the original public grants of land to the States and from the documents of their origination. Some derives from state, federal and local regulation of waters through zoning, public health and other regulation. Non-federally recognized Indian tribes do not have water rights. =Water law in England and Wales = Private companies are obliged to publish annually a sizeable report providing a relevant amount of nationwide comparable data on costs, revenues, profits, and performance levels. An independent regulatory authority of the water industry sector analyzes private companies outcomes and sets an allowed level of return which is not fixed and incentive-based. Privatizations in the UK were driven by an historical under-investment on an asset-intensive sector. =Water law in the European Union= For countries within the European Union, water-related directives are important for water resource management and environmental and water quality standards. Key directives include the Urban Waste Water Directive 1992 (requiring most towns and cities to treat their wastewater to specified standards), and the Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC, which requires water resource plans based on river basins, including public participation based on Aarhus Convention principles.

He had considerable success with several of his own works during his lifetime. Career Franco Alfano, circa 1919 Alfano was born in Posillipo, Naples. He attended piano lessons given privately by Alessandro Longo, and harmony and composition respectively under Camillo de Nardis (1857‚Äì1951) and Paolo Serrao at the conservatory San Pietro a Majella in Naples. Later, after graduating, he pursued further composition studies with Hans Sitt and Salomon Jadassohn in Leipzig. While working there he met his idol, Edvard Grieg, and wrote numerous piano and orchestral pieces. From 1918 he was Director of the Conservatory of Bologna, from 1923 Director of the Turin Conservatory, and from 1947 to 1950 Director of the Rossini Conservatory in Pesaro. Alfano died in San Remo.Dryden, Konrad, CPO recording of Cyrano di Bergerac Operas He completed his first opera, Miranda, still unpublished, for which he also wrote the libretto based on a novel by Antonio Fogazzaro in 1896. His work La Fonte Di Enschir (libretto by Luigi Illica) was refused by Ricordi but was presented in Wroc≈Çaw (then Breslau) as Die Quelle von Enschir on 8 November 1898. It enjoyed some success. There followed the opera Risurrezione in 1904. It was based on Tolstoy, and was later sung by Magda Olivero. Cyrano de Bergerac followed. This based on the famous play by Edmond Rostand and composed to the French libretto by Henri Cain. It had its Italian version premiere in Rome in January 1936, and its French version premiere in Paris four months later. It was recently revived by the Kiel Opera (Germany), the Montpellier Radio Festival (France) and the Metropolitan Opera, New York City, starring Pl√°cido Domingo in the title role. In 1921, La Leggenda di Sak√πntala appeared, described by somee.g. this author, for instance as his most important stage work, and while it was successful enough to have Arturo Toscanini recommend Alfano for the completion of Puccini's posthumous Turandot, the performance materials were thought destroyed in an air raid during the Second World War. Alfano reconstructed it in 1952 as Sak√πntala, after Abhij√±ƒÅna≈õƒÅkuntalam (The Recognition of Sakuntala), the Sanskrit play by KƒÅlidƒÅsa. Subsequently, the original version was recovered in 2005, with the two versions available for performance today. The second version of Sak√πntala was performed in New York City by Teatro Grattacielo in the fall of 2013. Historical perspectives In Fanfare 's issue of September/October 1998-99, it was asserted that Alfano's reputation suffers because of several things. Firstly, that he should not be judged as a composer on the basis of the task he was given in completing Turandot (La Scala, 25 April 1926). Secondly, that we almost never hear everything he wrote for Turandot since the standard ending heavily edits Alfano's work.Andreas K. W. Meyer (trans. Susan Marie Praeder), CPO opera set notes for Cyrano de Bergerac, pp. 29-30. Thirdly, [...]it is not his conclusion that is performed in productions of Turandot but only what the premiere conductor Arturo Toscanini included from it... Puccini had worked for nine months on the following concluding duet and at his death had left behind a whole ream of sketches... Alfano had to reconstruct...according to his best assessment...and with his imagination and magnifying glass\\" since Puccini's material \\"had not really been legible.\\"Dryden, Konrad, p. 33, adds that the project, reluctantly undertaken, resulted in \\"near blindness in his right eye, requiring three months spent in darkened rooms.\\"--Symphonies 1 and 2 [reviewed by Barry Brenesal in the same issue of Fanfare, pp. 103-04] \\"Alfano's reputation has also suffered [IC:along with Mascagni], understandably, because of his willingness to associate himself closely with Mussolini's Fascist government.\\" Alex Ross, in The New Yorker,Ross, Alex, New Yorker, 27 February 2006, pp. 84‚Äì85 notes that a new ending of Turandot composed by Luciano Berio premiered in 2002on andante.com Retrieved 1 April 2013 is preferred by some critics for making a more satisfactory resolution of Turandot's change of heart, and of being more in keeping with Puccini's evolving technique.

He proposed that the difference of the maximum positive and negative valence of an element tends to be eight. This has come to be known as Abegg's rule. He was a gas balloon enthusiast, which caused his death at the age of 41 when he crashed in his balloon in Silesia. Abegg received his PhD on July 19, 1891 as the student of August Wilhelm von Hofmann at the University of Berlin. Abegg learned organic chemistry from Hofmann, but one year after finishing his PhD degree he began researching physical chemistry while studying with Friedrich Wilhelm Ostwald in Leipzig, Germany. Abegg later served as private assistant to Walther Nernst at the University of G√∂ttingen and to Svante Arrhenius at the University of Stockholm. Abegg discovered the theory of freezing-point depression and anticipated Gilbert Newton Lewis's octet rule by revealing that the lowest and highest oxidation states of elements often differ by eight. He researched many topics in physical chemistry, including freezing points, the dielectric constant of ice, osmotic pressures, oxidation potentials, and complex ions. Personal life and education Richard Abegg was the son of Wilhelm Abegg and Margarete Friedenthal. He had a brother, Wilhelm Abegg, who became the Prussian Secretary of State. After attending Wilhelm High School in Berlin, Abegg studied organic chemistry at the University of Kiel and the University of T√ºbingen. He then attended the University of Berlin, from which he received his doctorate as the student of August Wilhelm von Hofmann. In 1895, he married Line Simon, who was also a ballooning enthusiast. Abegg occupied himself with photography and balloon excursions. He was the initiator and chairperson of the Silesian Club for Aeronautics in Breslau. Furthermore, he had an assessor's function with the presidency of the German Air Sailors' Association. Work During school, Abegg fulfilled his duties in the military. In 1891, he became an officer of the German Reserves. In 1900, he became an Oberleutnant in the Reserves in the 9th Regiment of Hussars. During this year, he made his first flight in a balloon, for military purposes. Balloon flights became a frequent pastime of both Abegg and his wife. He made many scientific observations during his subsequent flights, which were never published. In 1894, Abegg worked as an assistant to Walther Nernst, one of the founders of physical chemistry and, at the time, Professor of Physical Chemistry. In 1897, he took a position as a professor of chemistry at the University of Breslau. Two years later, Abegg became a Privatdozent (chemistry chair) at the Wroc≈Çaw University of Technology in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland. A year later he became a professor. Clara Immerwahr, the first wife of Fritz Haber, studied and graduated as his student. In 1909 he became a full professor. Together with his colleague Guido Bodl√§nder, he published on electro-affinity, then a new principle of inorganic chemistry. Abegg is known best for his research recognizing the role that valence had with respect to chemical interactions. He found that some elements were less likely to combine into molecules, and from this concluded that the more stable elements had what are now called full electron shells. He was able to explain the attraction of atoms through opposite electrical charges. He also made the distinction between normal valence and contravalence. He found that the sum of these two valences always comes to eight, a rule that is now known as Abegg's rule. Abegg was the editor of Zeitschrift f√ºr Elektrochemie from 1901 until his death in 1910.

Background The album was out of print for over a decade due to copyright infringement: the seventh track \\"Liebeslied\\" used unauthorized samples from a recording of \\"O Fortuna\\", from Carl Orff's 1930s cantata Carmina Burana. The album was recalled approximately three years after being released. Copies today are rare and considered collector's items.

APRA was established on 1 July 1998 in response to the recommendations of the Wallis Inquiry. APRA's authority and scope is determined pursuant to the . Regulatory scope APRA oversees banks, credit unions, building societies, friendly societies, general insurance, health insurance, reinsurance, and life insurance companies, and most members of the superannuation industry. It ensures that these institutions keep their financial promises; that is, that they will remain financially sound and able to meet their obligations to depositors, fund members and policy holders. It was established on 1 July 1998. APRA is funded largely by the industries that it supervises. APRA currently supervises institutions holding A$5.4 trillion in assets for Australian depositors, policyholders and superannuation fund members. The current chairman of APRA is Wayne Byres and the deputy chairman is Helen Rowell. Geoff Summerhayes is the third APRA member. History The Insurance and Superannuation Commission (ISC) was formally established on 23 November 1987, following the proclamation of the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner Act 1987. The commission was based at the Australian Automobile Association Building, Canberra212 Northbourne Avenue and also had offices in Melbourne and Sydney. The Insurance and Superannuation Commission was absorbed into the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority on 1 July 1998. In June 1996, the Financial System Inquiry (known as the Wallis Inquiry) was established to examine the results of the deregulation of the Australian financial system, to examine the forces driving further change, particularly technological, and recommend changes to the regulatory system to ensure an \\"efficient, responsive, competitive and flexible financial system to underpin stronger economic performance, consistent with financial stability, prudence, integrity and fairness.\\" At the time, the regulators of the Australian financial services industry were based on the institutions and not the regulatory function. APRA's predecessor regulators were the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Australian Financial Institutions Commission (AFIC). The Wallis Inquiry recommended a new structure.Parliamentary Library The role of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) was amended to deal with monetary policy and systemic stability with the Payments System Board considering payments systems regulation. The role of the Australian Prudential Regulation Commission (later to become APRA) was amended to deal with prudential regulation of authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs), life and general insurance, and superannuation including Industry superannuation. The Corporations and Financial Services Commission was renamed and its role expanded as the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) to deal with market integrity, consumer protection and corporations. APRA was established on 1 July 1998 under the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998. APRA became prominent in the collapse of HIH Insurance in 2001 and for its investigation into the National Australia Bank foreign currency deal scandal in 2004. APRA took over the previous role of the Private Health Insurance Administration Council in July 2015. In 2018 Peter Harris, the chair of the Productivity Commission, was critical of the role of APRA in limiting price competition in banking. Representatives of APRA appeared before the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry during 2018. In 2018 APRA created the restricted authorised deposit-taking institution (RADI) licensing framework to encourage new entrants and competition to the existing banking system.

His first credited appearance (as Svetlana Ambrosius, or Svet Am) was on the band's Na√Øve album (1990). He continued using that stage name until 1995's Nihil. Schulz displayed an impressive mastery of speed metal guitar skills and co-wrote many of KMFDM's songs from the 1990s. He also wrote and performed in various KMFDM side projects, including two albums with Sascha Konietzko's Excessive Force and a solo album by En Esch. He currently resides in Vancouver, British Columbia. In early manifestations of the KMFDM web site, Schulz maintained a section called \\"G√ºnter's Guitar Garage.\\" Among other things, he used the space to encourage amateur guitarists to learn formal notation as opposed to tablature. After KMFDM disbanded in 1999, Schulz and Esch recorded a few songs for tribute albums and then formed Slick Idiot, a band featuring Schulz's trademark guitar and Esch's vocal stylings. The band has, as of 2010, released three studio albums and two remix albums. KMFDM reformed in 2001, though Schulz and Esch rejected Konietzko's offer to return to the fold. Schulz is interested in photography and took many of the band portraits that appear in KMFDM and Slick Idiot liner notes. Concert attendees also observed Schulz taking pictures of the crowd during KMFDM's Symbols tour (1997). These photos became the material for the video \\"In Your Face\\". Guenter also travelled to Ghana as part of the crew for \\"So Good, So Far: the Way Forward\\". He took photographs for the film and documented the trip through his photographic prowess. In 2005, Schulz announced the formation of a self-titled solo project, Schulz. He was part of PIG's touring line-up in the summer of 2006, thus reuniting with fellow KMFDM album Raymond Watts.

Valkeakoski is located south of Tampere and north of Helsinki in the Pirkanmaa region. The municipality has a population of () and covers an area of of which is water. The population density is . The municipality is unilingually Finnish. Valkeakoski is best known for its paper industry and domestically highly successful football team, FC Haka. The town and the paper industry have both grown by the Valkeakoski rapids between the lake Mallasvesi in the north and the lake Vanajavesi in the south.  History  The Valkeakoski area is known to have been inhabited since the Iron Age. More than a thousand years ago, the ridges on the area served as a foundation of the Rapola fort. In the following Middle Ages, the mill town S√§√§ksm√§ki was the center of the area. However, industrialization towards the end of the 19th century increased the importance of what became the contemporary town of Valkeakoski. The channel of Valkeakoski was opened in 1869, and the first paper mill was completed in 1873, marking the beginning of a continuing tradition of the forest industry. The municipality of S√§√§ksm√§ki, from which the town of Valkeakoski was detached in 1923 was consolidated with Valkeakoski in 1973.History of Valkeakoski Districts, neighborhoods and villages =Countryside and villages= K√§rs√§nlahti bay on lake Mallasvesi The entire countryside of Valkeakoski consists mainly of the former S√§√§ksm√§ki municipality areas. * S√§√§ksm√§ki (consists of Huittula and Ritvala, Kemmola, M√§lki√§inen, Haukila, Uskila, Tyk√∂l√§, Viranmaa, Kasuri / Koivuniemi / Raija, Mets√§kansa, Ylenjoki, Konho, Nikkarinhanko / Muti, Rantoo, Yli-Nissi, K√§rjenniemi, Vedentaka, Kaapelinkulma, Kannistonm√§ki, Viuha, Mattila, Vuorentaka, Valto, Paino, Tarttila, Py√∂r√∂nmaa and Vanhakyl√§) =Districts= There are 25 districts in what is considered the urban area of Valkeaskoki.

The vehicle design is for a hydrogen-fuelled aircraft that would take off from a purpose-built runway, and accelerate to Mach 5.4 at altitude (compared to typical airliner's ) using the atmosphere's oxygen before switching the engines to use the internal liquid oxygen (LOX) supply to take it into orbit. It could carry of cargo to an equatorial low Earth orbit (LEO); up to to the International Space Station, almost 45% more than the capacity of the European Space Agency's Automated Transfer Vehicle; or to Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO), over 24% more than SpaceX Falcon 9 launch vehicle in reusable mode (). The relatively light vehicle would then re-enter the atmosphere and land on a runway, being protected from the conditions of re-entry by a ceramic composite skin. When on the ground, it would undergo inspection and necessary maintenance, with a turnaround time of approximately two days, and be able to complete at least 200 orbital flights per vehicle. As work on the project has progressed, information has been published on a number of design versions, including A4, C1, C2, and D1. Testing of the key technologies was successfully completed in November 2012, allowing Skylon's design to advance from its research phase to a development phase. , an engine test facility was being built at Westcott and if all goes to plan, the first ground-based engine tests could happen in 2020, and SABRE engines could be performing uncrewed test flights by 2025. In paper studies, the cost per kilogram of payload carried to LEO in this way is hoped to be reduced from the current ¬£1,108/kg (), including research and development, to around ¬£650/kg, with costs expected to fall much more over time after initial expenditures have amortised. In 2004, the developer estimated the total lifetime cost of the Skylon C1 programme to be about $12 billion. , only a small portion of the funding required to develop and build Skylon had been secured. For the first couple of decades the work was privately funded, with public funding beginning in 2009 through a European Space Agency (ESA) contract. The British government pledged ¬£60 million to the project on 16 July 2013 to allow a prototype of the SABRE engine to be built; contracts for this funding were signed in 2015. Research and development programme =Background and early work= Skylon has its origins within a previous space development programme for an envisioned single-stage-to-orbit spaceplane, known as HOTOL. In 1982, when work commenced on the HOTOL by several British companies, there was significant international interest to develop and produce viable reusable launch systems, perhaps the most high- profile of these being the NASA-operated Space Shuttle. In conjunction with British Aerospace and Rolls-Royce, a promising design emerged to which the British government contributed ¬£2 million towards its refinement; British engineer Alan Bond was amongst the engineers who worked on HOTOL. However, during 1988, the British government decided to withdraw further funding from the programme, resulting in development work being terminated. Aerospace publication Flight International observed that HOTOL and other competing spaceplane programmes were \\"over-ambitious\\" and that development on such launch systems would involve more research and slower progress than previously envisioned.\\"Slow road to reusability.\\" Flight International, 1 January 2000. The Skylon was developed from the British HOTOL project. Following the setback of HOTOL's cancellation, in 1989 Alan Bond, along with John Scott-Scott and Richard Varvill decided to establish their own company, Reaction Engines Limited, to pursue the development of a viable spaceplane and associated technology using private funding. In 1993, REL publicly revealed its spaceplane proposal, which it named Skylon after the Skylon structure that had inspired Alan Bond at the Festival of Britain exhibition. Skylon was a clean sheet redesign based on lessons learned during development of HOTOL, the new concept again utilised dual-mode propulsion system, using engines that could combust hydrogen with the external air during atmospheric flight. Early on, Skylon was promoted by the company to the ESA for its Future European Space Transportation Investigations Programme (FESTIP) initiative, as well as seeking out both government or commercial investment in order to finance the vehicle's development. REL has also sought to form ties with other companies with the aim of producing an international consortium of interested firms to participate in the Skylon programme. After securing additional funding in the 1990s, Reaction Engine's initial design underwent radical revision. =Project brief= The Skylon design features several distinct differences when compared with the earlier HOTOL programme. Whereas HOTOL would have launched from a rocket sled as a weight-saving measure, Skylon is to be equipped with conventional retractable undercarriage. The revised engine design, using the SABRE engine, is expected to offer higher performance than its predecessor. The rear mounted engine of HOTOL meant that the vehicle possessed intrinsically poor in-flight stability; early attempts to resolve this problem had ended up sacrificing much of HOTOL's payload potential, which in turn contributed to the failure of the overall project. Skylon's solution to the issue was to position its engines at the end of its wings, which located them further forward and much closer to the vehicle's longitudinal centre of mass, thereby resolving the instability problem. A computer-generated image of the Skylon spaceplane climbing to orbit. REL intends ultimately to operate as a for-profit commercial enterprise which, upon the completion of development, shall manufacture Skylon vehicles for multiple international customers who shall operate their fleets directly, while being provided with support from REL. Skylon has been designed with the target of achieving no less than 200 flights per vehicle. According to the company, its business plan is to sell vehicles for $1 billion each, for which it has forecast a market for at least 30 Skylons, while recurring costs of just $10 million per flight are predicted to be incurred by operators. While the REL intends to manufacture some components directly, such as the engine precooler, other components have been designed by partner companies and a consortium of various aerospace firms is expected to handle full production of Skylon. In service, Skylon could potentially lower the cost of launching satellites which, according to evidence submitted to the UK parliament by REL, is forecast to be around ¬£650/kg; as of 2011, the average launch cost using conventional methods was estimated to be roughly ¬£15,000/kg. Amongst other prospective operations, Skylon would be capable of transporting payloads of up to 10-tonnes to the International Space Station.Thisdell, Dell. \\"Skylon concept could be next spaceplane.\\" Flight International, 14 June 2011. REL has also completed internal studies into the use of Skylon as a launch platform for a network of space-based solar power satellites, which have been historically unfeasible due to high launch costs. According to business publication Management Today, Skylon has been discussed as a possible replacement for NASA's Space Shuttle programme. =Funding= Speaking in June 2011, REL estimated that it would require ultimately $12 billion to achieve an operational configuration, which was then estimated to be achieved around 2020, dependent on funding. The obtaining of additional financing for the Skylon programme from the British government has often been difficult. During 2000, REL issued an ultimately unsuccessful request for funding from the British government; according to the government, REL's proposal had involved an offer of a potentially large return on its investment. However, several officials have emerged as proponents and advocated for the official backing of the Skylon programme. Speaking in 2009, the former UK Minister for Science and Innovation, Lord Drayson, stated of REL: \\"This is an example of a British company developing world-beating technology with exciting consequences for the future of space.\\" During February 2009, following on from a series of extended discussions with the British National Space Centre (which later became the UK Space Agency), it was announced that a major funding agreement had been established between the British National Space Centre, ESA and REL, committing ‚Ç¨1 million ($1.28 million) for the purpose of producing a demonstration engine for the Skylon programme by 2011. The initiative, known as the Technology Demonstration Programme, was scheduled to last approximately 2.5 years, during which further financing in the form of ‚Ç¨1 million was made available by the ESA. The 2009 agreement allowed REL to involve several external companies, including EADS- owned Astrium, the University of Bristol and the German Aerospace Center (DLR), in further development work. As a consequence of the enactment of the Technology Demonstration Programme, REL was able to transition from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 2/3 up to 4/5 within a matter of months. By 2012, according to the UK Space Agency, the funding required to develop and construct the entire craft has not yet been secured; as such, research and development work was at that point mainly focused on the engines alone, which was supported by an ESA grant of ‚Ç¨1 million. In January 2011, REL submitted a proposal to the British Government requesting additional funding for the Skylon project. On 13 April 2011, REL announced that the design of the Skylon had passed several rigorous independent reviews. On 24 May 2011, the ESA publicly declared the design to be feasible, having found \\"no impediments or critical items\\" to be present in the proposal.Page, Lewis \\"ESA: British Skylon spaceplane seems perfectly possible (whizzo robot runway rocketplane cleared to proceed)\\". The Register. 24 May 2011.Emspak, Jesse. \\"REL‚Äôs Skylon spaceplane aims to take on SpaceX with a reusable rocket design.\\" theverge.com, 8 March 2016. Speaking on the topic of Skylon in 2011, David Willetts, the UK Minister of State for Universities and Science, stated: In June 2013, George Osborne, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, stated that the British government would be giving ¬£60 million towards the further development of the SABRE engine.\\"@George_Osborne\\". Twitter, 27 June 2013. The grant was contingent upon REL having an industrial partner. The first grant of ¬£50 million was approved by the European Commission in August 2015.\\"State aid: Commission approves ¬£50 million UK support for the research and development of an innovative space launcher engine\\" In October 2015, British defence conglomerate BAE Systems entered into an agreement with Reaction Engines, under which it would invest ¬£20.6 million in REL to acquire 20% of its share capital, as well as to provide assistance in the development of the SABRE engine. In July 2016, the second grant of ¬£10 million was approved by the ESA. On 25 September 2017 it was announced that the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) had awarded a contract to Reaction Engines for an undisclosed amount to conduct high-temperature airflow testing at a Colorado, United States site of a Reaction Engines precooler called HTX. Testing work is scheduled to start in 2018. In April 2018, Reaction Engines announced Boeing and Rolls-Royce would be joining BAE Systems as investors in the development of the SABRE engine. A total of $37.5 million of new funding is to be provided including contributions from Baillie Gifford Asset Management and Woodford Investment Management.http://aviationweek.com/defense/boeing-rolls-royce-back- reaction-hypersonic-engine- developer?NL=AW-05&Issue;=AW-05_20180412_AW-05_974&sfvc4enews;=42&cl;=article_2&elq2;=dec1a870a6ce48d088046561c44e0eac =Development= The precooler rig that tested the heat exchange system of the SABRE engine.

From 2007 to 2009 REL worked with University of Bristol and Airborne Engineering on Project STERN (Static Test Expansion/Deflection Rocket Nozzle), which tested REL's engine ignition system, a REL designed air breathing hydrogen rocket engine, and investigated the flow stability and behaviour of with Dr Neil Taylor's expansion deflection nozzle design via multiple test-firings by Airborne Engineering. An expansion deflection nozzle is capable of compensating for the changing ambient pressure encountered while gaining altitude during atmospheric flight, thus generating greater thrust and thereby efficiency. Work on STERN was continued in project STRICT (Static Test Rocket Incorporating Cooled Thrust-chamber), which investigated the stability of the engine's exhaust flow and the dissipation of the generated heat into the engine walls. The results and designs delivered by both the STRICT and STERN projects were subsequently declared by REL to have been \\"a great success\\". Static testing of the engine precooler began in June 2011, marking the start of Phase 3 in the Skylon development programme, In April 2012, REL announced that the first series of the precooler test programme had been successfully completed. On 10 July 2012, REL announced that the second of three series of tests has been completed successfully, and the final series of tests would begin the following month after the testing facilities had been upgraded to allow testing of temperatures. ESA's propulsion division audited the precooler tests during mid-2012 and found the results satisfactory. On 9 May 2011, REL stated that a preproduction prototype of the Skylon could be flying by 2016, and the proposed route would be a suborbital flight between the Guiana Space Centre near Kourou in French Guiana and the North European Aerospace Test Range, located in northern Sweden. Pre-orders are expected in the 2011‚Äì2013 time frame coinciding with the formation of the manufacturing consortium. On 8 December 2011, Alan Bond stated that Skylon would enter into service by 2021‚Äì2022 instead of 2020 as previously envisaged. On 13 July 2012, ESA Director-General Jean-Jacques Dordain publicly stated that the ESA would be holding a series of talks with REL with the aim of developing a further \\"technical understanding\\". In November 2012, REL announced that it would commence work upon a three-and-a-half-year project to develop and build a test rig of the Sabre engine to prove its performance across both the air-breathing and rocket modes. Technology and design =Overview= The Skylon is a fully reusable single stage to orbit (SSTO) vehicle, able to achieve orbit without staging, which is intended to be used principally as a reusable launch system. Proponents of the SSTO approach have often claimed that staging involves a number of inherent complications and problems due to complexity, such as being difficult or typically impossible to recover and reuse most elements, thus unavoidably incurring great expense to produce entirely new launch vehicles instead; therefore, they believe that SSTO designs hold the promise of providing a reduction to the high cost of space flights. Operationally, it is envisioned for the non-crewed Skylon to take off from a specially strengthened runway, gain altitude in a fashion akin to a conventional aeroplane and perform an ascent at very high speeds, in excess of five times the speed of sound (), to attain a peak altitude of roughly , on the edge of low earth orbit (LEO), where payloads would typically be launched prior to the vehicle's re-entry into the atmosphere, upon which it will conduct a relatively gentle descent before performing a traditional landing upon a runway. The Skylon spaceplane is designed as a two-engine, \\"tailless\\" aircraft, which is fitted with a steerable canard. The design of the Skylon D1 features a large cylindrical payload bay, long and in diameter. It is designed to be comparable with current payload dimensions, and able to support the containerisation of payloads that Reaction Engines envisions being produced in the future. To an equatorial orbit, Skylon could deliver to a altitude or to a altitude. Using interchangeable payload containers, Skylon could be fitted to carry satellites or fluid cargo into orbit, or, in a specialised habitation module, the latter being capable of housing a maximum of 30 astronauts during a single launch. Richard Varvill, technical director at REL, stated of REL's market: \\"we're competing with expendable rockets, a machine that is only used once\\". Because the SABRE engine uses the atmosphere as reaction mass at low altitude, it will have a high specific impulse (around for SABRE 4, or for SABRE 3), and burn about one fifth of the propellant that would have been required by a conventional rocket. Therefore, Skylon would be able to take off with much less total propellant than conventional systems. The weight reduction enabled by the lower quantity of propellant needed meant that the vehicle would not require as much lift or thrust, which in turn permits the use of smaller engines and allows for the use of a conventional wing configuration. While flying within the atmosphere, the use of wings to counteract gravity drag is more fuel-efficient than simply expelling propellant (as in a rocket), which again serves to reduce the total amount of propellant needed. The payload fraction would be significantly greater than normal rockets and the vehicle should be fully reusable, capable of performing in excess of 200 launches. =SABRE engines= A cross section of a model of an early SABRE engine design One of the most significant features of the Skylon's design is its powerplant, known as Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine (SABRE). The design of the SABRE engine has drawn heavily upon the STRICT/STERN experimental engines, sharing many features such as the propellant and the adoption of the trialled Expansion Deflection Nozzle, as well as building upon the wider field of liquid air cycle engines (LACE). The engines are designed to operate much like a conventional jet engine to around , altitude, beyond which the air inlet closes and the engine operates as a highly efficient rocket to orbital speed. The proposed SABRE engine is not a scramjet, but a jet engine running combined cycles of a precooled jet engine, rocket engine and ramjet. Originally the key technology for this type of precooled jet engine did not exist, as it required a heat exchanger that was ten times lighter than the state of the art. Research conducted since then has achieved the necessary performance. Operating an air-breathing jet engine at velocities of up to Mach 5.5 poses numerous engineering problems; several previous engines proposed by other designers have worked well as jet engines, but performed poorly as rockets. This engine design aims to be a good jet engine within the atmosphere, as well as being an excellent rocket engine outside; however, the conventional problem posed by operating at Mach 5.5 has been that the air coming into the engine rapidly heats up as it is compressed into the engine; due to certain thermodynamic effects, this greatly reduces the thrust that can be produced by burning fuel. Attempts to avoid these issues have typically resulted in the engine being much heavier (scramjets/ramjets) or has greatly reduced the thrust generated (conventional turbojets/ramjets); in either of these scenarios, the end result would be an engine that possesses a poor thrust to weight ratio at high speeds, which in turn would be too heavy to assist much in reaching orbit. The SABRE engine design aims to avoid the historic weight-performance issue by using some of the liquid hydrogen fuel to cool helium within a closed-cycle precooler, which quickly reduces the temperature of the air at the inlet. The air is then used for combustion in a similar manner to a conventional jet engine. Once the helium has left the pre-cooler it is further heated by the products of the pre-burner giving it enough energy to drive the turbine and the liquid hydrogen pump. As a consequence of the air being cooled at all speeds, the jet can be built of light alloys and the weight is roughly halved. Additionally, more fuel can be burnt at high speeds. Beyond Mach 5.5, the air would normally become unusably hot despite the cooling; accordingly, the air inlet is closed upon attaining this speed and the engine instead is solely fed via on-board liquid oxygen and hydrogen fuel, as in a traditional rocket. =Fuselage and structure= Diagram of the vehicle's internal sections, highlighting the areas allocated to storing hydrogen, oxygen and the payload The currently proposed Skylon model D1 is a large vehicle, possessing a length of and a diameter of . The fuselage of the Skylon is expected to be a silicon carbide reinforced titanium space frame; Alt URL a light and strong structure that supports the weight of the aluminium fuel tanks and to which the ceramic skin is attached. Multiple layers of titanium foil thermal insulation are sandwiched between the skin and frame to protect the inside of Skylon from the heat of hypersonic flight and the intense heat of re-entry. Due to the vehicle's use of a low-density fuel in the form of liquid hydrogen, a great volume is required to contain enough energy to reach orbit. The propellant is intended to be kept at low pressure to minimise stress; a vehicle that is both large and light has an advantage during atmospheric reentry compared to other vehicles due to a low ballistic coefficient. Because of the low ballistic coefficient, Skylon would be slowed at higher altitudes where the air is thinner; as a consequence, the skin of the vehicle would reach only .\\"During re-entry the temperature is kept down to by dynamically controlling the trajectory via active feedback of measured skin temperatures. This is possible by virtue of the low ballistic coefficient and the controllability of a lifting vehicle with active foreplanes. \\" Skylon Assessment Report (ESA) In contrast, the smaller Space Shuttle was heated to on its leading edge, and so employed an extremely heat-resistant but fragile silica thermal protection system. The Skylon design does not require such an approach, instead opting for using a far thinner yet durable reinforced ceramic skin; however, due to turbulent flow around the wings during re-entry, some sections of the vehicle shall need to be provided with active cooling systems. The Skylon shall possess a retractable undercarriage, equipped with high pressure tyres and water-cooled brakes; if any difficulties were to occur just before a take-off, the brakes would be applied to stop the vehicle, the water boiling away to dissipate the heat. During a normal landing, the empty vehicle would be far lighter, and hence the water would not be required, so upon a successful take- off, the of water would be jettisoned. When this feature was introduced in the C1 model of the design the weight of the brakes was reduced from around . =Support facilities= A special runway will be required for launch: it needs to be reinforced to tolerate the high equivalent single wheel load; necessitated by the Skylon's 325 tonnes takeoff weight; it will need to have heat resistant sections at the start of the take-off run and at the rotation zone; and it will have to be long to allow the Skylon to accelerate to its rotation speed, yet still have to abort the launch and brake to a standstill if required. The Skylon would be able to land on a Code F civil runway. When on the ground, it would undergo inspection and necessary maintenance, with a turnaround time of approximately two days, and be able to complete at least 200 orbital flights per vehicle.Skylon.

The PS-1 anti-submarine warfare (ASW) variant is a flying boat which carried its own beaching gear on board, while the search-and-rescue (SAR) orientated US-1A is a true amphibian. Development of the PS-1 has its origins in flying boat research performed by the Shin Meiwa during the 1950s. The company, believing that their design was capable of regular use upon the open sea, petitioned the Japanese military to acquire the type as a maritime patrol aircraft (MPA). Following the demonstration of a converted Grumman HU-16 Albatross testbed aircraft, referred to as the UF-XS, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) awarded Shin Meiwa a contract in 1966 to further develop its design via two further prototypes, which were designated PS-X. During 1969, the JMSDF placed the first order for an eventual fleet of 21 ASW aircraft, designated PS-1; orders for the SAR variant, designated US-1A, were also issued during the 1970s. Shin Meiwa were keen to develop additional variants and derivative aircraft, including substantially larger designs which they had studied, but many of these ambitions remained as paper projects only. During the 1980s, the JMSDF decided to adopt land-based Lockheed P-3 Orions, displacing the PS-1s from the ASW role and leading to the variant's retirement during 1989. Following the withdrawal of the last active US-1A in 2017, the type has been replaced by the ShinMaywa US-2, a modernised variant. Design and development =Background= Following the end of the Second World War and the start of the Occupation of Japan, a ban on aircraft manufacturing imposed during December 1945 required Japan's aircraft industry to find other work.Simpson, James. \\"Japan's defense industry is super excited about this amphibious plane.\\" The Week, 10 September 2015. During the late 1940s, Japanese aircraft manufacturer Kawanishi Aircraft Company reorganised itself, becoming ShinMeiwa Industries. During the 1950s, the emergence of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union led to the aircraft construction ban being rescinded; Shin Meiwa, which had turned to heavy machinery and engine manufacturing for the intervening years, decided to resurrect their old aircraft works. Initially, the company focused on smaller efforts, such as subcontracting work, the production of drop tanks, and performing airframe overhauls of both Japanese and American aircraft, such as the US Navy's Martin P5M Marlin flying boats. However, senior figures, such as chief aircraft designer Shizo Kikuhara and founder Ryuzo Kawanishi were keen to pursue projects of a greater scope. During the early 1950s, Kawanishi had formed a committee headed by Kikuhara which was tasked with developing seaplane designs that would feature greater seaworthiness. Unlike most seaplanes, they held the ambitious aim of producing an aircraft that could land upon rough seas and encounter little impact from waves and spray. By 1959, the committee felt that it had developed an appropriate design to meet its specification. Two years later Kikuhara, who now headed up the company's Amphibian Development Division, was lobbying the Japanese Defense Agency to consider the adoption of a flying boat to meet the nation's requirement for an anti-submarine warfare (ASW) patrol aircraft. Shin Meiwa stated that they would produce a specialised design to undertake the ASW mission. Crucial support came from the US Navy, who were keen to see Japan's ASW capabilities expand to help track and contain the growing Soviet submarine presence in the Pacific. =Concept and testing= To support the development of the Shin Meiwa's ideas, the Americans provided a single Grumman HU-16 Albatross flying boat, which was disassembled, reverse engineered and reassembled into a flying testbed aircraft, referred to as the UF-XS. The converted flying boat featured numerous adaptations, including a novel boundary layer control system to provide enhanced Short Takeoff/Landing (STOL) performance, while the Albatross's two Wright R-1820 radial engines were supplemented by two Pratt & Whitney R-1340 radial engines on the aircraft's wings, with an additional General Electric T58 turboshaft inside the aircraft's hull to drive the boundary layer control system.Lake Air International November 2005, p. 27. The UF-XS also featured a new T-tail arrangement, hull-based deflectors, and a rounded stubby nose radome which resembled that of the P5M Marlin. From 1962 onwards, the UF-XS performed numerous test flights, demonstrating the improved features which enabled a flying boat to both land and take-off from the open ocean; these tests were closely followed and critiqued by the Japanese military. Over time, the UF-XS continued to be modified to improve its stability and other key performance criteria. In 1966, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) awarded Shin Meiwa a contract to further develop its design to produce a patrol aircraft capable of the ASW mission; accordingly, two further prototypes were constructed under the designation PS-X. In addition to Shin Meiwa, other Japanese companies, such as Fuji Heavy Industries and NIPPI Corporation, also played major roles in the PS-X's development. The adaptions resulted in significant seaworthiness improvements; during tests conducted in the Kii Channel during 1968, the PS-X successfully landed amid formidable four-meter waves, despite these being in excess of its design goal of three meters. Having been suitably impressed, during 1969, the JMSDF issued a production order for a batch of 21 aircraft, which were given the designation PS-1, to meet its ASW requirement. In spite of its demonstrated performance, the project was not without its critics. The programme soon became politically controversial as its relatively small production run had resulted in an extremely high unit-cost for these aircraft, largely due to the inherent costs involved in the development of brand new aircraft designs. For its part, Shin Meiwa made efforts to commercialise design elements of the aircraft, such as its hydraulics and engine control systems; it exported its rough-sea roll-damping technology to other seaplane companies. =Further development= Head-on view of a JMSDF US-1A parked on land The PS-1 had not been in service long before the JMSDF requested the development of a search-and-rescue (SAR) variant. Shin Meiwa, being keen to pursue the aircraft's development, embarked upon fulfilling this request. By deleting much of the PS-1's military equipment, room was freed up to provide the aircraft with a greater fuel capacity, retractable landing gear, and rescue equipment. The new variant, which was designated the US-1A, could also quickly be converted for troop-carrying. The US-1A was Japan's first amphibian, operating from land and sea, which meant that it could transfer survivors to land facilities via ambulance more quickly. First flown on October 15, 1974, it was accepted into service during the following year, and eventually 19 aircraft were purchased. From the seventh aircraft on, an uprated version of the original engine was used, all aircraft were eventually modified to this US-1A standard. During the 1990s, by which point the US-1A fleet was beginning to show its age, the JMSDF attempted to obtain funding towards acquiring a replacement, but could not secure enough to develop an entirely new aircraft. Therefore, during 1995, ShinMaywa (as Shin Meiwa had been renamed, reportedly so that the name would be easier to pronounce for non-Japanese speakers) set about planning to produce an upgraded version of the US-1A, initially referred to as the US-1A kai (US-1A Êîπ - \\"improved US-1A\\"). This aircraft features numerous aerodynamic refinements and modernised systems, along with a pressurised hull, and the adoption of more powerful Rolls-Royce AE 2100 engines. Flight tests of the new variant began on December 18, 2003. The JMSDF has chosen to purchase up to 14 of these aircraft, which has entered service as the ShinMaywa US-2.  Unbuilt concept aircraft  In 1977, Shin Meiwa revealed that it had several ideas for its STOL flying boat concept on the drawing board, but ultimately none of these were ever built. They were the Shin Meiwa LA (Light Amphibian), a 40-passenger light amphibian for inter-island feeder service; the 400-passenger Shin Meiwa MA (Medium Amphibian); the Shin Meiwa MS (Medium Seaplane) a 300-passenger long-range flying boat with its own beaching gear; and the gargantuan Shin Meiwa GS (Giant Seaplane) with a capacity of 1200 passengers seated on three decks. Unlike the Shin Meiwa LA and MA which were like the US-1 in design, the Shin Meiwa MS and GS had their engines located in front of and above the wing to take advantage of the CoandƒÉ effect. In the end, none of the four designs got beyond paper studies.Wahl, Paul. \\"1200 Passengers on three decks...a come back for flying boats.\\" Popular Mechanics, November 1977, pp. 84-85. Operational history MCAS Iwakuni, Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan, 2011 Between 1971 and 1978, 21 PS-1 flying boats entered service with the JMSDF; starting in 1973, they were operated as Fleet Air Wing 31. The PS-1 ASW variant carried homing torpedoes, depth charges and 127mm Zuni rockets as offensive armament, but lacked any defensive weapons. It was equipped with dipping sonar, which had limited use as it required the aircraft to land on water to deploy. It could also carry 20 sonobuoys. It had a crew of ten: pilot, co-pilot, flight engineer, navigator and six sensor/weapons operators. On a typical ASW mission, a PS-1 would range over hundreds of square miles of ocean, landing between 12 and 16 times to dip its sonar. The type was capable of numerous feats, such as being able to routinely land in seas with waves of up to in height. Water distance for takeoff or landing with aircraft weight was with no wind or into a 15-knot wind. Apart from the boundary layer control system, which was powered by an independent gas turbine housed within the fuselage, the aircraft had a number of other innovative features, including a system to suppress spray during water handling, and directing the propwash from the aircraft's four turboprop engines over its wings to create yet more lift. During 1976, a single PS-1 was experimentally modified to perform aerial firefighting missions; it possessed an internal capacity of of water. During the 1980s, the JMSDF decided to replace the PS-1 in the ASW role with land-based Lockheed P-3 Orions; the last examples of the ASW variant were phased out of service in 1989. It was outlived by the Search- and-Rescue oriented US-1A fleet, which continued to be used into the 21st century. The US-1A's first rescue was from a Greek vessel in 1976. Despite having been envisioned largely to perform air-sea rescues of military personnel, the US-1A has mostly been involved in civilian assistance operations.Wright, Tim. \\"Giant Amphibian - Japan has one godzilla of a seaplane.\\" Air & Space Magazine, January 2003. Between 1976 and 1999, Japan's US-1A fleet has reported been used in over 500 rescues and were responsible for the saving of 550 lives. The US-1A was retired on December 13, 2017 when the last example in JMSDF service conducted its final flight. According to aviation periodical Air International, a total of 827 people have been rescued by US-1s since the type had entered service during 1976. It has been succeeded in its role by the modernised US-2.

There is no direct evidence for genetic sexual attraction being an actual phenomenon, and the hypothesis is regarded as pseudoscience.  Background  The term was coined in the US in the late 1980s by Barbara Gonyo, the founder of Truth Seekers in Adoption, a Chicago-based support group for adoptees and their new- found relatives. She developed sexual feelings for her son when she met him after he was adopted away, but he did not want to be part of any such contact. Because many traits are at least partially determined by genetics, genetic sexual attraction is presumed, according to those who believe in the concept, to occur as a consequence of genetic relatives meeting as adults, typically as a consequence of adoption. However, this is a very rare consequence of adoptive reunions. Another suggested explanation for the phenomenon is possible narcissistic feelings. Incest is extremely rare between people raised together in early childhood due to a reverse sexual imprinting known as the Westermarck effect, which desensitizes them to later close sexual attraction. It is hypothesized that this effect evolved to prevent inbreeding. Direct studies Although reported frequently as anecdote in the field of psychology, there are no studies showing that people are sexually attracted to those genetically similar to them. Studies of MHC genes show that unrelated people are less attracted to those genetically similar to them. However, in mice, this lack of attraction can be reversed by adoption. While it has been documented that sexual attraction can occur between related individuals in some cases, it is not clear that calling this attraction GSA is appropriate. Criticism Critics of the hypothesis have called it pseudoscience. Amanda Marcotte of Salon has stated that the term is nothing but an attempt at sounding scientific while trying to minimize the taboo of incest. She also expressed that many news outlets have handled reports of the subject poorly by repeating what the defenders of the hypothesis have said as opposed to actually looking into the research on the supposed phenomenon. She states that most of the publications which have chosen to run stories of couples speaking about \\"genetic sexual attraction\\" are not legitimate news sources and that one of the blogs which were written by a woman in an incestuous relationship simply reads like a story of a young girl who has been groomed by her father. The use of \\"GSA\\" as an initialism has also been criticized, since it gives the notion that the phenomenon is an actual diagnosable \\"condition\\". Eric Anderson, sociologist and sexologist, states that the one single academic research paper on the subject uses \\"Freudian psycho-babble\\". Catherine MacAskill, an adoption and child sexual abuse expert, stated that \\"although [...] concerns are understandable [for adoptees and biological parents]\\" before attempting a reunion, one who researches the subject will realize that so called \\"genetic sexual attraction\\" cases seem to be associated with sudden unplanned meetings which lack the proper safeguards of a thoroughly prepared reunion.

El danz√≥n. La Habana. It is also an active musical form in Mexico, and is much loved in Puerto Rico as well. Written in time, the danz√≥n is a slow, formal partner dance, requiring set footwork around syncopated beats, and incorporating elegant pauses while the couples stand listening to virtuoso instrumental passages, as characteristically played by a charanga or tipica ensemble. The danz√≥n evolved from the Cuban contradanza, or habanera ('Havana- dance'). The contradanza, which had English and French roots in the country dance and contredanse, was probably introduced to Cuba by the Spanish, who ruled the island for almost four centuries (1511‚Äì1898), contributing many thousands of immigrants. It may also have been partially seeded during the short-lived British occupation of Havana in 1762, and Haitian refugees fleeing the island's revolution of 1791‚Äì1804 brought the French-Haitian kontradans, contributing their own Creole syncopation.Manuel, Peter, editor, 2009. \\"Creolizing Contradance in the Caribbean.\\" Philadelphia: Temple University Press; see also Carpentier, Alejo. 2001. Music in Cuba. Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press. p146 In Cuba, the dances of European origin acquired new stylistic features derived from African rhythm and dance to produce a genuine fusion of European and African influences.Chasteen, John Charles 2004. National rhythms, African roots: the deep history of Latin American popular dance. Albuquerque, N.M. Chapter 5. African musical traits in the danz√≥n include complex instrumental cross-rhythms, expressed in staggered cinquillo and tresillo patterns. By 1879, the year Miguel Failde's Las alturas de Simpson was first performed (in Matanzas), danz√≥n had emerged as a distinct genre. Danz√≥n went on to interact with 20th-century Cuban genres such as son, and through the danz√≥n-mambo it was instrumental in the development of mambo and cha-cha-ch√°.  History  Danz√≥n dancers from Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, Mexico City. The danz√≥n developed from the habanera, a creolized Cuban dance form. By 1879, the year Las alturas de Simpson composed by Miguel Failde (leader of the Orquesta Fa√≠lde) was first performed in Matanzas, danz√≥n had emerged as a distinct genre. Creation of the new danz√≥n form is generally attributed to Fa√≠lde.Failde, Osvalde Castillo 1964. Miguel Fa√≠lde: cr√©ador musical del Danz√≥n. Consejo Nacional de Cultura, La Habana. In 1998, the province Matanzas held a festival to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Danz√≥n. The classical composer Manuel Saumell has also been cited as a key figure in its delineation.Carpentier, Alejo 2001 [1945]. Music in Cuba. Minneapolis MN. p191 = Precursors: figure dances = The English contradanza was the predecessor of the \\"habanera\\", also known as danza criolla. Out of this Creole genre, the Habanera, was born in 1879 another Cuban genre, called danzon, a sequence dance, in which all danced together a set of figures.A set group of dance steps that makes up a recognized, named movement. The first use of the term danz√≥n, which dates from the 1850s, is for just such a dance. Havana's daily paper, El Triunfo, gave a description of this earlier danz√≥n. It was a co-ordinated dance of figures performed by groups of Matanzas blacks. The dancers held the ends of colored ribbons, and carried flower-covered arches. The group twisted and entwined the ribbons to make pleasing patterns.'El danz√≥n', article in El Triunfo, 25 July 1882.Chasteen, John Charles 2004. National rhythms, African roots, p75-76. This account can be corroborated by other references, for example, a traveler in Cuba noted in 1854 that black Cubans \\"do a kind of wreath dance, in which the whole company took part, amid innumerable artistic entanglements and disentanglements\\".Bremer, Fredrika 1853. The homes of the New World: impressions of America. Harper, N.Y. vol 2, p308. This style of danz√≥n was performed at carnival comparsas by black groups: it is described that way before the late 1870s.La Aurora del Yumur√≠, two articles: 'Danz√≥n' (24.11.1871) and 'Magnifica comparsa' (2.12.1871) Fa√≠lde's first danz√≥ns were created for just such sequence dances. Fa√≠lde himself said \\"In Matanzas at this time there was a kind of square dance for twenty couples who carried arches and flowers. It was really a dance of figures (sequence dance), and its moves were adapted to the tempo of the habanera, which we took over for the danz√≥n.\\"Failde, Osvalde Castillo 1964. Miguel Fa√≠lde: cr√©ador musical del Danz√≥n. p85 [rough transl. by contributor] = Structure and instruments = The form of danz√≥n created by Miguel Fa√≠lde in 1879 (Las alturas de Simpson), begins with an introduction (four bars) and paseo (four bars), which are repeated and followed by a 16-bar melody. The introduction and paseo again repeat before a second melody is played. The dancers do not dance during these sections: they choose partners, stroll onto the dance floor, and begin to dance at precisely the same moment: the fourth beat of bar four of the paseo, which has a distinctive percussion pattern that's hard to miss. When the introduction is repeated the dancers stop, chat, flirt, greet their friends, and start again, right on time as the paseo finishes. Orquesta Enrique Pe√±a Pe√±a seated left, Barreto (violin) and Urf√© (clarinet) Early danz√≥n was played by groups called orquestas t√≠picas, which were based on wind instruments. They had several brass instruments (cornet, valve trombone, ophicleide), a clarinet or two, a violin or two and tympani (kettle drums). At the beginning of the 20th century, the lighter and somewhat more elegant sound of the charanga emerged (see Early Cuban bands). Initially, they were small orchestra of two violins, a cello, flute, timbales, g√ºiro, and doublebass. Charanga and t√≠picas competed with each other for years, but after 1930 it was clear that the days of the t√≠pica were over. In 1898, a piano was included in a charanga for the first time. In Antonio Mar√≠a Romeu's hands a piano became standard. Its musical flexibility, its ability to influence both melody and rhythm, made it invaluable. In 1926, in his arrangement of Tres lindas cubanas, Romeu incorporated a piano solo for the first time. His was Cuba's top charanga for many years. = Initial perception = Similar to other dances in the Caribbean and Latin America, the danz√≥n was initially regarded as scandalous, especially when it began to be danced by all classes of society. The slower rhythm of the danz√≥n led to couples dancing closer, with sinuous movements of the hips and a lower centre of gravity. The author of a survey of prostitution in Havana devoted a whole chapter to the iniquities of dancing, and the danz√≥n in particular.De Cespedes, Benjamin 1888. La prostituci√≥n en La Habana. Articles in newspapers and periodicals took up the theme: :\\"Because I love my country, it hurts me to see danz√≥n at gatherings of decent people.\\"'El danz√≥n' articles in La Voz de Cuba (8.10.1879) and (20.11.1879); transl. from Chasteen p77. :\\"We recommend banning the danza and danz√≥n because they are vestiges of Africa and should be replaced by essentially European dances such as the quadrille and rigadoon.\\"'Sobre bailes' in 'La Habana elegante' (19.8.1888); transl. from Chasteen p80 Apparently, the danz√≥n, which later became an insipid dance for older couples, was at first danced with \\"obscene movements\\" of the hips by young couples in close embrace, with bodies touching, and by couples who might come from different races... :\\"First we had the danza, then came the danz√≥n... next it will be the rumba, and finally we'll all end up dancing √±√°√±igo!\\"'El porvenir del baile en Cuba' in El Almendares (a Havana women's magazine) (7.9.1881); trans from Chasteen p81 So, behind the concern about music and dance were concerns about sexual licence, and about miscegenation, the mixing of races. As with other similar cases, the criticism was to no avail. The danz√≥n became hugely popular, and was the dominant popular music in Cuba until the advent of the son in the 1920s. At length the Cuban government made Fa√≠lde the official inventor of the danz√≥n - but not until 1960, by which time the danz√≥n had become a relic, and its 'child', the chachach√°, had taken over.Failde, Osvalde Castillo 1964. Miguel Fa√≠lde: cr√©ador musical del Danz√≥n. La Habana. Here the official document is reprinted in full: El danz√≥n, baile nacional de Cuba. = Influence of son = In 1910, some 30 years after Fa√≠lde's early days, Jos√© Urf√© added a montuno as a final part of his El Bomb√≠n de Barretto. This was a swinging section, consisting of a repeated musical phrase, which introduced something of the son into the danz√≥n (a tactic which was to recur again). Because of the popularity of son in the 1920s and 1930s, Aniceto D√≠az in Rompiendo la rutina in 1929 added a vocal part, thereby creating a new genre called the danzonete. Orquesta Romeu with singer Fernando Collazo, end-1920s Later development led to more syncopation, which eventually led to the danz√≥n-ch√°, nuevo ritmo, cha-cha-ch√°, pachanga and mambo. From the 1940s to the 1960s danz√≥n and its derivatives were highly popular in Cuba, with several truly fine charangas playing most days of the week. Orquesta Arag√≥n kept up an exceptionally high standard for many years, but the danz√≥n itself gradually dropped out, and is now a relic dance. Danz√≥n has never ceased to influence Cuban musicians, and it is reflected in many popular Cuban music genres, in Cuban Latin jazz, salsa, songo and timba, the latter building upon the charanga orchestration. Groups like Los Van Van and Orquesta Rev√© developed from charangas. Their make-up and orchestration (by Juan Formell) has been so greatly altered that it is difficult to identify traces of danz√≥n; indeed, their present styles owe more to son than to danz√≥n. The addition of brass instruments such as trombones and trumpets, and conga drums signalled a wider range of music.  Mexican Danz√≥n  Danz√≥n was also very popular in the Gulf Coast state of Veracruz, Mexico, because of the strong Cuban influence in the region. Later on, danz√≥n developed in Mexico City, specially in the famous Sal√≥n M√©xico; it has survived as a dance longer there than in Cuba. Danz√≥n also flourished in the city of Oaxaca, and many famous danzones were composed by Oaxacan musicians such as the famous Nereidas and Tel√©fono de larga distancia, both works of Amador P√©rez Dimas, from the town of Zaachila, near Oaxaca city. Today, people still dance danz√≥n in Mexico, particularly in the main plazas of Veracruz, Oaxaca and Mexico City, and in yearly festivals across Mexico. The dance had a second revival in the 1990s, especially among Mexico's senior citizens. A film called Danz√≥n was released in 1991 directed by Mar√≠a Novaro. Plot: Julia (Mar√≠a Rojo) is a phone operator in Mexico City who lives for her job, her daughter and danz√≥n. Every Wednesday, Julia does the danz√≥n with Carmelo (Daniel Rergis) in the Sal√≥n Colonia. They have danced for years without becoming close. One night, Carmelo disappears without a trace. Lonely and sad, Julia takes a train to Veracruz, where she knows Carmelo has a brother. That trip changes her life. Concert music Danz√≥n no. 2 by Mexican composer Arturo M√°rquez (b. 1950) is a popular piece in orchestral concerts. Rhythmic structure Basic baqueteo timbales part. The basic timbales part for danz√≥n is called the baqueteo. In the example above, the slashed noteheads indicate muted drum strokes, and the regular noteheads indicate open strokes. The g√º√≠ro also plays this pattern. The danz√≥n was the first written music to be based on the organizing principle of sub-Saharan African rhythm, known in Cuba as clave.Pe√±alosa, David (2010). The Clave Matrix; Afro-Cuban Rhythm: Its Principles and African Origins p. 254. Redway, CA: Bembe Inc. .  Style and form structure  Danz√≥n is elegant and virtuoso music, with dance. A danz√≥n, in its original form, was not sung, and did not feature any improvisations, unlike some other Cuban genres. A danz√≥n has the following typical structure: *An introduction or paseo (A), usually 16 bars. *The theme or principal melody (B), featuring the flute, thus often referred to as parte de (la) flauta. *A repeat of the introduction. *The trio (C), featuring the strings, thus also called parte del viol√≠n. *Ending. This could either be a clich√© ending (there are a few standard danz√≥n endings), another repeat of the introduction, or a combination of both. The classic form is thus ABAC or ABACA. A danz√≥n-ch√° or danz√≥n-mambo typically add another part (D), a syncopated open vamp in which soloists may sometimes improvise, creating an ABACD or, more common, ABACAD.  Mambo section  In danz√≥n, the mambo section is the final section of an arrangement. It was first devised by Orestes L√≥pez, who added syncopated motifs taken from the son, together with improvised flute variations.Orovio, Helio 2004. Cuban music from A to Z. He called this type of danz√≥n ritmo nuevo (new rhythm).

Lieutenant James Cook first claimed British sovereignty over the eastern part of Australia at Possession Island in 1770, but British administrative control only began in the Torres Strait Islands in 1862. The islands are now mostly part of Queensland, a constituent State of the Commonwealth of Australia, but are administered by the Torres Strait Regional Authority, a statutory authority of the Australian federal government. A few islands very close to the coast of mainland New Guinea belong to the Western Province of Papua New Guinea, most importantly Daru Island with the provincial capital, Daru. Only 14 of the islands are inhabited. The Torres Strait Islands' population was recorded at 4,514 in the 2016 Australian census, with 91.8% of these identifying as Indigenous Torres Strait Island peoples. Although counted as Indigenous Australians, Torres Strait Islander peoples, being predominantly Melanesian, are ethnically, culturally and linguistically different from Aboriginal Australians.  History  The Indigenous inhabitants of the Torres Strait Islands are the Torres Strait Islanders, an ethnically Melanesian people who also inhabited the northern tip of Cape York Peninsula. They are ethnically and linguistically distinct from the Aboriginal people of Australia. There was continuous inter-island warfare. In particular, the Murray (Mer) islanders were known as the fiercest raiders and head- hunters. They waged constant warfare against the Darnley islanders, their nearest neighbours. The Spanish navigator Lu√≠s Vaez de Torres explored Torres Strait in 1606. Torres had joined the expedition of Pedro Fernandes de Queir√≥s, which sailed west from Peru across the Pacific Ocean in search of Terra Australis. Erub (Darnley Island), c. 1849 Captain James Cook first claimed British sovereignty in 1770 over the eastern part of Australia at Possession Island. British administrative control did not begin until 1862 in the Torres Strait Islands, marked by the appointment of John Jardine, police magistrate at Rockhampton, as Government Resident in the Torres Straits. He originally established a small settlement on Albany Island, but on 1 August 1864 he settled at Somerset Island. The London Missionary Society (LMS) mission, led by Rev. Samuel Macfarlane, arrived on Erub (Darnley Island) on 1 July 1871. After the Anglican Church took over their mission in the 20th century, they referred to the events as \\"The Coming of the Light\\", and established an annual celebration on 1 July. Yumplatok (also known as Torres Strait Creole and Broken) is a contemporary Torres Strait Island language spoken in the Torres Strait. The contact with missionaries, traders and other English speakers since the 1800s led to the development of a pidgin language. It developed more fully as a creole language, with its own distinctive sound system, grammar, vocabulary, usage and meaning. Torres Strait Creole is spoken by most Torres Strait Islanders and is a mixture of Standard Australian English and traditional indigenous languages. It is an English-based creole; however, each island has its own version of creole. Torres Strait Creole is also spoken on the Australian mainland, including in the Northern Peninsula Area Region and coastal communities such as Cairns, Townsville, Mackay, Rockhampton and Brisbane. In 1872 the boundary of Queensland was extended to include Thursday Island and other islands in Torres Strait within 60 miles of the Queensland coast. In 1879 Queensland annexed the other Torres Strait Islands. They were classified as part of the British colony of Queensland and, after 1901, of the Australian state of Queensland. But some of them lie just off the coast of New Guinea. In 1885 John Douglas was appointed as Government Resident Magistrate residing on Thursday Island. He made periodic tours of all the islands and was known to all the natives. He established the system under which the hereditary native chief of each island was installed as chief magistrate, supporting the local traditional system. He also established Native Police, but the only island on which the Native Police were armed was Saibai. There they were provided with Snider carbines to repel the attacks of the Marind-anim (formerly known as Tugeri), the headhunters who raided the islands from their territory on the New Guinea coast. In 1898‚Äì1899 the Cambridge Anthropological Expedition led by Alfred Cort Haddon visited the Torres Strait Islands. Among its members was W. H. R. Rivers, who later gained notability for his work in psychology and treating officers in the Great War.The Recordings of the Cambridge Anthropological Expedition to Torres Straits, National Film and Sound Archive: at Sounds of Australia registry They collected and took about 2000 cultural artefacts, ostensibly to save them from destruction by missionaries.

In 1899 John Douglas had initiated a process of electing island councils, intended to loosen the power of missionaries in the islands. They had become powerful by default because the government did not have resources to administer the territory. In the Western islands, where the traditional lifestyle was semi-nomadic, the council system continued to thrive. During World War II, many Torres Strait Islander people served in the Torres Strait Light Infantry Battalion of the Australian Army. From 1960 to 1973 Margaret Lawrie captured some of the Torres Strait Islander people's culture by recording their recounting of local myths and legends. Her anthropological work, stored at the State Library of Queensland, has recently been recognised and registered with the Australian UNESCO Memory of the World Programme. The proximity of the islands to Papua New Guinea became an issue when the territory started moving to gain independence from Australia, which it gained in 1975. The Papua New Guinea government objected to the position of the border close to the New Guinean mainland, and the subsequent complete control that Australia exercised over the waters of the strait. The Torres Strait Islanders opposed being separated from Australia and insisted on no change to the border. The Australian Federal government wished to cede the northern islands to appease Papua New Guinea, but were opposed by the Queensland government and Queensland Premier Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen. An agreement was struck in 1978 whereby the islands and their inhabitants remained Australian, but the maritime boundary between Australia and Papua New Guinea was defined as running through the centre of the strait. In practice the two countries co-operate closely in the management of the strait's resources.For a detailed map see , for the agreement see In 1982, Eddie Mabo and four other Torres Strait Islander people from Mer (Murray Island) started legal proceedings to establish their traditional land ownership. Because Mabo was the first-named plaintiff, it became known as the Mabo Case. In 1992, after ten years of hearings before the Queensland Supreme Court and the High Court of Australia, the latter court found that the Mer people had owned their land prior to annexation by Queensland. This ruling overturned the long-established legal doctrine of terra nullius (\\"no-one's land\\"), which held that native title over Crown land in Australia had been extinguished at the time of annexation. The ruling thus has had far-reaching significance for the land claims of both Torres Strait Islanders and Australian Aborigines. Its effects are still being felt in the 21st century, as indigenous communities establish claims to their traditional lands under the Native Title Act of 1993. =Governance= On 1 July 1994 the Torres Strait Regional Authority (TSRA) was created. In March 2008 fifteen Torres Strait Islander Councils were amalgamated into a single body to form a Torres Strait Island Regional Council, or Torres Strait Island Region, created by the Queensland Government in the interest of financial viability, and accountability and transparency of local governments throughout the State. It is administered from Thursday Island, but Thursday, Horn Island, Prince of Wales Island and many others are under the Shire of Torres council.  Geography  Torres Strait Islands The islands span an area of some . The strait from Cape York to New Guinea has a width of approximately at its narrowest point; the islands lie scattered in between, extending some from furthest east to furthest west. The total land area of the islands comprises . of land are used for agricultural purposes. The Torres Strait itself was previously a land bridge which connected the present-day Australian continent with New Guinea (in a single landmass called Sahul, Meganesia, Australia-New Guinea). This land bridge was most recently submerged by rising sea levels at the end of the last ice-age glaciation approximately 12,000 years ago, forming the Strait which now connects the Arafura and Coral seas. Many of the western Torres Strait Islands are the remaining peaks of this land bridge which were not completely submerged when the ocean levels rose. The islands and their surrounding waters and reefs provide a highly diverse set of land and marine ecosystems, with niches for many rare or unique species. Saltwater crocodiles inhabit the islands along with neighboring areas of Queensland and Papua New Guinea. Marine animals of the islands include dugongs (an endangered species of sea mammal widely found throughout the Indian Ocean and tropical Western Pacific, including Papua-New Guinean and Australian waters), as well as green, ridley, hawksbill and flatback sea turtles. The Torres Strait Islands may be grouped into five distinct clusters, which exhibit differences of geology and formation as well as location. The Torres Strait provides a habitat for numerous birds, including the Torresian imperial-pigeon, which is seen as the iconic national emblem to the islanders. These islands are also a distinct physiographic section of the larger Cape York Platform province, which in turn is part of the larger East Australian Cordillera physiographic division. = Top Western islands = The islands in this cluster lie very close to the southwestern coastline of New Guinea (the closest is less than offshore). Saibai (one of the largest of the Torres Strait Islands) and Boigu (one of the Talbot Islands) are low-lying islands which were formed by deposition of sediments and mud from New Guinean rivers into the Strait accumulating on decayed coral platforms. Vegetation on these islands mainly consists of mangrove swamps, and they are prone to flooding. The other main island in this group, Dauan (Mt Cornwallis), is a smaller island with steep hills, composed largely of granite. This island actually represents the northernmost extent of the Great Dividing Range, the extensive series of mountain ranges which runs along almost the entire eastern coastline of Australia. This peak became an island as the ocean levels rose at the end of the last ice age. The isolated and uninhabited Deliverance Island is west of Boigu, the nearest of the Top Western islands. = Near Western islands = The islands in this cluster lie south of the Strait's midway point, and are also largely high granite hills with mounds of basaltic outcrops, formed from old peaks of the now submerged land bridge. Moa (Banks Island) is the second-largest in the Torres Strait, and Badu (Mulgrave Island) is slightly smaller and fringed with extensive mangrove swamps. Other smaller islands include Mabuiag, Pulu and further to the east Naghir (correct form Nagi) (Mt. Ernest). Culturally this was the most complex part of Torres Strait, containing three of the four groupings/dialects of the Western-central Islanders, Nagi being culturally/linguistically a Central Island (Kulkalaig territory, specifically part of Waraber tribal waters), Moa is part of the Muwalaig-Italaig-Kaiwalaig [Kauraraig/Kaurareg] tribal areas, with two groups, the Italaig of the south, and the Muwalaig of the north. Many Kauraraig also live there, having been forcibly moved there in 1922‚Äì1923. Badu and Mabuiag are the Maluigal Deep Sea People. = Inner islands = The township of Thursday Island These islands, also known as the Thursday Island group, lie closest to Cape York Peninsula, and their topography and geological history is very similar. Muralag (Prince of Wales Island) is the largest of the Strait's islands, and forms the centre of this closely grouped cluster. The much smaller Waiben Thursday Island is the region's administrative centre and most heavily populated. Several of these islands have permanent freshwater springs, and some were also mined for gold in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Because of their proximity to the Australian mainland, they have also been centres of pearling and fishing industries. Nurupai Horn Island holds the region's airport, and as a result is something of an entrep√¥t with inhabitants drawn from many other communities. Kiriri (Hammond Island) is the other permanently settled island of this group; Tuined (Possession Island) is noted for Lt. James Cook's landing there in 1770. Moa in the Near Western group is culturally and linguistically speaking part of this group. = Central islands = This cluster is more widely distributed in the middle of Torres Strait, consisting of many small sandy cays surrounded by coral reefs, similar to those found in the nearby Great Barrier Reef. The more northerly islands in this group however, such as Gerbar (Two Brothers) and Iama (Yam Island), are high basaltic outcrops, not cays. Nagi is a culturo-linguistic part of this group, and also has high basaltic outcropping. The low-lying inhabited coral cays, such as Poruma (Coconut Island), Warraber Island and Masig (Yorke Island) are mostly less than long, and no wider than . Several have had problems with saltwater intrusion. = Eastern islands = The islands of this group (principally Mer (Murray Island), Dauar and Waier, with Erub Island and Stephens Island (Ugar) further north) are formed differently from the rest. They are volcanic in origin, the peaks of volcanoes which were active in Pleistocene times. Consequently, their hillsides have rich and fertile red volcanic soils, and are thickly vegetated. The easternmost of these are less than from the northern extension of the Great Barrier Reef. Regions and symbolism of the flag The national flag features a white Dhari (headdress) and, underneath, a white five-pointed star, symbolising \\"peace, the five major island groups and the navigational importance of stars to the seafaring people of the Torres Strait\\". The five points of the star on the flag represent the following regions (which do not match administrative regions): *Northern Division (Boigu, Dauan, Saibai) *Eastern Islands (Erub, Mer, Ugar) *Western Division (St. Pauls, Kubin, Badu, Mabuiag) *Central Division (Masig, Poruma, Warraber, Iama) *Southern Division (Thursday, Horn, Prince of Wales and Hammond Islands, NPA and Mainland Australia)  Administration  Hammond Island, Torres Strait =Regional Authority= The Torres Strait Regional Authority (TSRA), an Australian Commonwealth statutory authority created in 1994, exercises governance over the islands. The TSRA has an elected board comprising 20 representatives from the Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal communities resident in the Torres Strait region. One representative per established local community wins election to the board under the Queensland Community Services (Torres Strait) Act 1984 and Division 5 of the ATSIC Act 1989. The TSRA itself falls under the portfolio responsibilities of the Australian Government Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (previously under the Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs). Thursday Island functions as the administrative centre of the islands. The TSRA now represents the local communities at both Commonwealth and State levels; previously, State representation operated via a Queensland statutory authority called the Island Coordinating Council (ICC). The Torres Strait Island Region local government area superseded the ICC in March 2008. In March 2008 fifteen Torres Strait Islander Councils were amalgamated into a single body to form a Torres Strait Island Regional Council, or Torres Strait Island Region, created by the Queensland Government in the interest of financial viability, and accountability and transparency of local Governments throughout the State. It is administered from Thursday Island, but Thursday, Horn Island, Prince of Wales Island and many others are under the Shire of Torres council. =Local (shire) level government= At the local level there are two authorities. One is the Shire of Torres, which governs several islands and portions of Cape York Peninsula and operates as a Queensland local government area. The other is the Torres Strait Island Region, created in 2008, which embodies 15 former island councils. These former councils had been previously relinquished by the Government of Queensland to specific Islander and Aboriginal Councils under the provisions of the Community Services (Torres Strait) Act 1984 and the Community Services (Aboriginal) Act 1984), consisting of: * Badu Island Council * Bamaga Island Council * Boigu Island Council * Dauan Island Council * Erub Island Council * Hammond Island Council * Iama Island Council * Kubin Island Council * Mabuiag Island Council * Mer Island Council * Poruma Island Council * Saibai Island Council * Seisia Island Council * St Pauls Island Council * St Patrick Island council * Ugar Island Council * Warraber Island Council * Yorke Island Council Independence movement Notable politicians have declared support for independence, including Bob Katter and former Queensland Premier Anna Bligh, who in August 2011 wrote to Prime Minister Julia Gillard in support of Torres Strait Islands independence from Australia; Prime Minister Gillard said in October 2011 \\"her government will respectfully consider the Torres Strait's request for self-government\\".

Demographics and languages Torres Strait Islander peoples, the Indigenous peoples of the islands, are predominantly Melanesians, culturally most akin to the coastal peoples of Papua New Guinea. Thus they are regarded as being distinct from Aboriginal peoples of Australia, and are generally referred to separately, despite ongoing historical trade and inter-marriage with mainland Aboriginal people. There are also two Torres Strait Islander communities on the nearby coast of the mainland, Bamaga and Seisia. According to the 2016 Australian census figures, the population of the Torres Strait Islands was 4,514, of whom 4,144 (91.8%) were Torres Strait Islanders. These inhabitants live on only 14 of the 274 islands. (People identifying themselves as of Torres Strait Islander descent living in the whole of Australia numbered 32,345, while those of both Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal descent numbered a further 26,767.) According to the Torres Strait Treaty, residents of Papua New Guinea are permitted to visit the Torres Strait Islands for traditional purposes. There are three languages spoken on the islands. The two indigenous languages are the Western-Central Torres Strait Language (called by various names, including Kalaw Lagaw Ya, Kalaw Kawaw Ya, Kulkalgau Ya and Kaiwaligau Ya), and the Eastern Torres Language Meriam Mir. Another language, Torres Strait Creole, also known as Brokan and Yumplatok, is used throughout Torres Strait, in neighbouring Papua as far as the West Papuan border area, and Cape York, as well as in many island communities in mainland Australia. Climate change The Torres Strait Islands are threatened by rising sea levels, especially those islands which do not rise more than above sea level. Storm surges and high tides pose the greatest danger. Other developing problems include erosion, property damage, drinking water contamination and the unearthing of the dead. As of June 2010, there were no relocation strategies in place for Torres Strait Islanders. In early 2020 it was reported that Warraber is particularly threatened by rising sea levels, and coastal defences have been built on many of the beaches on the island. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has predicted that by 2100, tides will rise 30‚Äì110 cm, depending on the timing and level of cuts to carbon emissions. Several of the smaller islands in the group are also under threat. Disease control The banana plant leaf disease black sigatoka, the major banana disease worldwide, is endemic to Papua New Guinea and the Torres Strait Islands. Occasional infections have been discovered on Cape York Peninsula but they have been successfully halted with eradication programs. The disease most likely appeared on the mainland via plant material from the Torres Strait Islands.  Music  The music of the Torres Strait is principally vocal accompanied by instruments. The introduction of Christianity through the London Missionary Society, beginning in 1871, had a profound influence, but before that time the musical culture reflected the cultural and geographic diversity of the Strait.

The males are conspicuously patterned in black and white while the females are olive brown and speckled. They breed in the central Himalayan forests and winter in the hill forests of southern India and Sri Lanka. Like many other thrushes, they forage on leaf litter below forest undergrowth and fly into trees when disturbed and sit still making them difficult to locate. Description Male wintering in Karnataka, India Jerdon but described by Edward Blyth. This image is from Jerdon's 1843-47 Illustrations of Indian Ornithology and was lithographed by C.V. Kistnarajoo based on an illustration by S. N. Ward of the Madras Civil Service, the background foliage was added by Captain S. Best of the Madras Engineers. Males of this thrush are conspicuously black and white. Mostly black on the upper parts it has a long white supercilium, and white tips to the wing coverts, tertials, rump and tail. The underparts are white with black flank spots the bill and legs are yellow. Females and young birds have the same basic pattern, but the black is replaced by dark brown, and the white by light brown. The markings on the underside are scalier. The third primary is the longest followed by the fourth with the second and fifth being nearly equal in length. The first primary is reduced. The bill is not as strongly curved as that of the dark-sided thrush or the long-billed thrush and the female lacks the prominent pale cheek spot of the similar looking female Siberian thrush. The binomial commemorates Samuel Neville Ward (1813‚Äì1897), a British colonial administrator in India from 1832 to 1863. Jerdon and Charles Darwin corresponded with S.N. Ward who worked in the Madras Civil Service, posted for sometime at Sirsi and was known for his natural history studies and artistic talent. Thomas C. Jerdon who first obtained a specimen of the species from Ward notes: The species was variously placed in the past and for a long time in the genus Zoothera along with many other thrushes but molecular phylogenetic studies in 2008 clarified the phylogeny and the requirements for monophyly of the genera led to the older genus Geokichla being resurrected. The genus Zoothera now contains species that are not strongly sexually dimorphic unlike Geokichla. The pied thrush's closest relative is the Siberian thrush Geokichla sibirica. Distribution The summer breeding range is from western Himachal Pradesh in the Himalayas east at least until central Nepal. Records from further east such as Sikkim have been questioned by Rasmussen and Anderton (2005). The pied thrush is migratory, wintering mainly in Sri Lanka, with smaller numbers in the hills of south India. During passage, they may be preyed on by crows. Although rare, they are locally and seasonally seen regularly at certain locations in winter such as at Victoria Park in Nuwara Eliya, Sri Lanka, where a number of birds gather by the stream early in the morning or in some hills stations in southern India such as Nandi Hills and Yercaud. Behaviour and ecology They forage alone or in pairs, often seen on the ground but flying into the trees and perching still when disturbed. The pied thrush, like many Zoothera thrushes, can be quite secretive. Pied thrushes are omnivorous, but eat more insects than fruit. They form loose flocks in winter. The breeding season is May to July and the nest is a deep cup lined with grass and cemented with mud and placed in a low tree fork. The clutch consists of 3‚Äì4 white or bluish eggs. This uncommon species breeds in the Himalayas between in thick woodland. The wintering areas are similar but include less well-wooded areas, and are generally at altitude. Their song is not considered as musical as those of many others thrushes and consists of a series of squeaky notes followed by short trills.

It argues that affluent persons are morally obligated to donate far more resources to humanitarian causes than is considered normal in Western cultures. The essay was inspired by the starvation of Bangladesh Liberation War refugees, and uses their situation as an example, although Singer's argument is general in scope and not limited to the example of Bangladesh. The essay is anthologized widely as an example of Western ethical thinking.In the preface to the book version of the essay published in 2016 by Oxford University Press, Singer said: \\"An incomplete list of anthologies in which it has been printed runs to fifty.\\" Some examples are:  * *  Summary  One of the core arguments of this essay is that, if one can use one's wealth to reduce suffering‚Äîfor example, by aiding famine-relief efforts‚Äîwithout any significant reduction in the well- being of oneself or others, it is immoral not to do so. According to Singer, such inaction is clearly immoral if a child is drowning in a shallow pond and someone can save it but chooses not to;Singer points out that saving the child \\"will mean getting my clothes muddy, but this is insignificant, while the death of the child would presumably be a very bad thing.\\" . nor does placing greater geographical distance between the person in need and the potential helper reduce the latter's moral obligations: > It makes no moral difference whether the person I can help is a neighbor's > child ten yards away from me or a Bengali whose name I shall never know, ten > thousand miles away. [...] The moral point of view requires us to look > beyond the interests of our own society. Previously, [...] this may hardly > have been feasible, but it is quite feasible now. From the moral point of > view, the prevention of the starvation of millions of people outside our > society must be considered at least as pressing as the upholding of property > norms within our society. The affluent, says Singer, are consistently guilty of failing to recognize this, having large amounts of surplus wealth that they do not use to aid humanitarian projects in developing nations. Here is the thrust of Singer's argument: *\\"Suffering and death from lack of food, shelter and medical care are bad\\". *\\"If it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, then we ought, morally, to do it\\". *\\"It makes no moral difference whether the person I can help is a neighbor's child ten yards from me or a Bengali whose name I shall never know, ten thousand miles away\\". *\\"The principle makes no distinction between cases in which I am the only person who could possibly do anything and cases in which I am just one among millions in the same position\\". Reception and criticism Gilbert Harman has stated that he considers \\"Famine, Affluence, and Morality\\" as one of the most famous articles in ethics. James Rachels said of the article: \\"one felt intellectual interest in the argument, but also guilt for not having contributed more money to relieve starvation\\". Singer's article also influenced the writing of Peter Unger's 1996 book Living High and Letting Die. A common criticism of Singer's essay is the demandingness objection. The \\"supposed obligation\\" of Singer's essay has been criticised by John Kekes, and by John Arthur.http://www.food.unt.edu/arguments/singer_arthur.pdf Singer's claim of a straight path from commonsense morality to great giving has also been disputed. The drowning child analogy featured in the paper formed the basis of choral music that has been performed by S√∂dra Latin Chamber Choir (conducted by Jan Risberg) and Choate Chamber Chorus.  Quotations  *\\"[N]either our distance from a preventable evil nor the number of other people who, in respect to that evil, are in the same situation as we are, lessens our obligation to mitigate or prevent that evil.\\" * \\"[I]f it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought, morally, to do it.\\" This, according to Singer, is a qualified reassertion of the principle that governs his argument. * \\"People do not feel in any way ashamed or guilty about spending money on new clothes or a new car instead of giving it to famine relief. (Indeed, the alternative does not occur to them.) This way of looking at the matter cannot be justified. When we buy new clothes not to keep ourselves warm but to look 'well-dressed' we are not providing for any important need.\\"  See also  * Bangladesh famine of 1974 * Effective altruism * Doing Good Better by William MacAskill, 2015 * The Life You Can Save by Peter Singer, 2009  Notes   References  * * With a foreword by Bill and Melinda Gates and a new preface and two extra essays by Singer.

She had measurements of 38‚Äì23‚Äì37. June Palmer as Little Bo-Peep, circa 1985 Career June Palmer began work as a topless dancer at the Windmill Theatre in London, and started modelling professionally in the late-1950s. She appeared in 8mm glamour films made by Harrison Marks (Flesh and Fantasie; Nightmare at Elm Manor; Photo Session; Star Strip; Dream Goddess; China Garden and The Naked World of June Palmer), Russell Gay (So Fur, So Good; Beauty and the Barn), Express Films (Body Beautiful) and Arthur Howell (June in Orbit; Calamity June; Castaway; Mission Possible and Special Agent). She later played minor parts in movies, including Taste the Blood of Dracula (1969), The Nine Ages of Nakedness (1969), Games That Lovers Play (1971) and On the Game (1974). Although she stopped modelling for magazines in 1970, Palmer continued to do some private modelling for London's various camera clubs until 1987. Photographer Irv Carsten said this about Palmer in the March 1962 issue of Modern Man, \\"I felt ashamed using an automatic camera. Her posing is second nature, she's beautiful from any angle, and without camera settings to make, there's nothing to do but watch.\\" Personal life In 1964, when she was 24 years old, Palmer married the then 44-year-old photographer/stuntman Arthur Howell. In the 1960s they had started and run Strobe Studios in Clapham, South London, an LCC licensed model agency and photographic studio, which advertised in many of the photographic magazines such as Practical Photography. Strobe rented out their studio space to amateur and professional photographers, and provided them with the glamour models who were on Strobe's books as photographic subjects. Mary Millington (at that time using her married name Mary Maxted), Carole Augustine and Ava Cadell all worked as models for Strobe Studios in the early 1970s.

The village faces Lyme Bay and is a little over west of the town of Seaton. It is situated on Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site and its picturesque cliffs, including Beer Head, form part of the South West Coast Path. At the 2011 Census, the parish had a population of 1,317. The village Beer is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, at which time it was located within Colyton hundred and had 28 households. Its name is not derived from the drink, but from the Old English word bearu, meaning \\"grove\\" and referring to the original forestation that surrounded the village. It is a pretty coastal village that grew up around a smugglers' cove and caves which were once used to store contraband goods. These are now part of the attraction of the village. Many of the buildings are faced with flint, a hard glassy stone found in the local chalk rock. Historically, the main sources of income for the village include fishing and lace production. Boats are winched up the beach as there is no harbour, and fresh fish is sold nearby. Nowadays small electrically driven winches using steel cables or tractors are located on the beach to haul boats in. Higher up is an old manual capstan operated by up to 20 men, now disused. A brook winds its way in an open conduit alongside the main road down to the sea. A WW2 pillbox is located close to the western side of the beach exit. The shape of the coastline allowed local seafarers to operate in weather conditions when other towns could not, because it is protected from the prevailing westerly winds by Beer Head and the chalk cliffs which are the westernmost outcrop of limestone on the southwest coast. View at the entrance to the Pecorama Pleasure Gardens in Beer, including a restored Golden Arrow train Pullman railway carriage. Nowadays, the sources of income are mainly tourism and fishing. Beer is also the home of the Pecorama (run by the Peco model railway manufacturer), which includes pleasure gardens and the Beer Heights Light Railway. Beer has a steep pebble beach. This makes walking on the beach difficult. Long rubber mats ‚Äî actually recycled conveyor belts ‚Äî are laid down to assist walkers. Beer is home to a cave complex, the Beer Quarry Caves, resulting from the quarrying of Beer stone. This stone has been prized since Roman times, because of its workability for carving and for its gentle yellow colour on exposure to air. Beer stone was used in the construction of 24 cathedrals around the UK, including Exeter Cathedral, Westminster Abbey and St. Paul's Cathedral, and was also used in the building of Christchurch Cathedral, St.Louis. Missouri, USA. Bovey House, an Elizabethan manor house, is a mile inland. Starre House, the oldest house in Beer is built using the local Beer stone that has been quarried since Roman times. Bacteria taken from cliffs at Beer on the south coast were launched to the International Space Station in 2008. The Beer microbes were placed on the European Space Agency's (ESA) Technology Exposure Facility and were sent up still sitting on, and in, small chunks of cliff rock from the Jurassic Coast. After 553-days they found that many were still alive. The survivors are now reproducing in a laboratory. This was part of an experiment to study the survival of microbes (which naturally live on the stone) in extreme conditions. A new species of cyanobacteria was isolated at the Open University that could be used in future space settlements on the Moon and Mars to produce oxygen and break down rocks.

History The ENSAE was established in 1942 under the National Statistics Service (ancestor of the INSEE, National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies) under the name of the School of Applied Statistics. In 1946, the creation of INSEE, the school took the name of INSEE Specialization School. At this time, the school led to two types of administrative career: \\"administrateur\\" (the highest managing level of the INSEE administration) and \\"attach√©\\" (a lower level) civil servant executives. Early promotions included five or six \\"administrateurs\\" students five or six \\"attach√©s\\" students. The decree of 2 November 1960 changed the name of the school into the National School of Statistics and Economic Administration. The number of students grew, and the curriculum opened to graduate students from Law Schools and Universities of Economics. The decree of 15 April 1971 clarified the administrative status and the objective of the school in the academic field, definitely making the ENSAE a Grande Ecole. In the 1980s, a system of scholarship was established to support doctoral studies. A research laboratory, the CREST (Center for Research in Economics and Statistics), was formed in 1988. In 1994, the Department of training for \\"attach√©s\\", became a full-fledged school, the National School for Statistics and Analysis Areas information (ENSAI, relocated to Rennes). The \\"administrateurs\\" training stayed at the ENSAE where more and more students now choose to specialize in financial modeling and other new area of applied statistics such as biostatistics or marketing. In 2006, Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin announced officially the moving of the school to the new ParisTech Campus in Palaiseau, near the √âcole Polytechnique in 2010. In 2017, the school moved to its current campus in Palaiseau.  Mission  Included in the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) under the tutelage of Ministry of the Economy, Industry and Employment, ENSAE provides training for statisticians-economists, some of which are civil servants belonging to the Corps des Administrateurs de l'INSEE, a category of top level public managers in the French administration. Economists and statisticians trained are intended to contribute to the economic research; former students hold positions within international organizations (UN, IMF, World Bank, European Commission,...) and French administration or other public institutions (Ministry of Economy, INSEE, CREST,...). The school admits students from diverse backgrounds: * Alumni of classes pr√©paratoires (from scientific preparatory classes MP / MP *, but also business school preparatory classes ( \\"HEC math\\") and Humanities and Social Sciences preparatory classes (Kh√¢gne BL)). * Admission after a graduate degree (normaliens, polytechniciens students or other holders of Grandes √©coles Master's degrees). The institution is actually the only French Grande √©cole to admit scientific, business and humanities students. Since 2006 the school is accredited to deliver the title of \\"ing√©nieur\\" by the French Commission of Engineering Titles. Curriculum The specialization available during the last year. *Actuarial Science *Market Analysis & Corporate Finance *Quantitative Finance *Quantitative Methods & Social Sciences *Forecasting & Economic Policy *Statistics *Data Science Academic affiliations The school has several partnerships and agreements with other academic institutions where students can complete their curriculum during their specialization year. A large and growing number of students chose to do such dual degree program in order to get an additional Master of Science, MBA or PhD degree from renowned institutions in the area of economics, finance, statistics and applied Mathematics where its cursus is one of the best: Harvard, Columbia, Humboldt University of Berlin, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, etc. The ENSAE also has a partnership with Sciences Po Paris, allowing its students to pursue both curriculum at the same time and get an additional master's degree from Sciences Po. The agreement waives the students from passing the entry written examination. ENSAE is member of ParisTech, the excellence engineering cluster gathering the best parisian Grandes Ecoles in each area of engineering: X, AgroParisTech, ENGREF, Ponts, ESPCI, Mines, ENSTA, ENSAM, T√©l√©com Paris, Chimie ParisTech.  Jobs prospects  Former ENSAE graduates work mainly in Data Science and Machine learning, but also in finance, management, consulting, economic analysis and research (in economics and statistics). About 10% of the recent alumni work in the public sector, the remaining works in capital markets (25%), insurance (25%), consulting (15%) or other industry sectors. Around 30% of them get a first job outside France, in particular in London and New York. They are hired by tech firms, financial firms such as banks, insurers or hedge funds for their technical expertise in Data Science, Machine learning, finance, mathematics, economics and statistics. 2006 graduates positions are as follows: * 53% work in Machine learning/Data Science (including research) * 33% work in finance insurance: * 21% work in financial engineering * 7% are traders * 11% are actuaries * 3% are portfolio managers * 24% are work in market survey and consulting: * 10% economic analysis * 4% consulting * 1% audit Since the ENSAE was founded, more than 5,000 statisticians economists, machine learning engineers, and data scientist have graduated.First job in 2006 Remark Note that the abbreviation ENSAE also refers to SUPAERO, a grande √©cole for aerospace engineering in Toulouse, France (now ISAE). In order to mark the difference between the two schools, ENSAE is called \\"ENSAE Paris\\", in reference to the city where it is located. Alumni As a Grande Ecole, the ENSAE has a strong and organized alumni network. The \\"Association des Anciens de l'ENSAE\\" (ENSAE Alumni Association) manages the links between the different generations of graduates and help them at each stage of their career. The ENSAE Alumni Association is a member of ParisTech Alumni, manageurs.com and AAGEF. The current president of the association is Julien Guitard. Here is a list of some of the most accomplished alumni.

He fought in the Polish Campaign of 1939 and at the Battle of Arnhem (Netherlands) in 1944 as commander of the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade.  Early military career  = Early years and studies = Stanis≈Çaw Sosabowski was born on 8 May 1892, in Stanislau (Polish: Stanis≈Çaw√≥w), in a railway workers' family. He graduated from a local gymnasium and in 1910 he was accepted as a student of the faculty of economy of the Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w. However, the death of his father and the poor financial situation of his family forced him to abandon his studies and return to Stanislau. There he became a member of Dru≈ºyny Strzeleckie, a semi-clandestine Polish national paramilitary organisation. He was soon promoted to the head of all Polish Scouting groups in the area. = World War I = In 1913, Sosabowski was drafted into the Austro-Hungarian Army. After training, he was promoted to the rank of corporal, serving in the 58th Infantry Regiment. After the outbreak of World War I he fought with his unit against the Imperial Russian Army in the battles of Rzesz√≥w, Dukla Pass and Gorlice. For his bravery, he was awarded several medals and promoted to First Lieutenant. In 1915, he was badly wounded in action and withdrawn from the front. In November 1918, after Poland regained its independence Sosabowski volunteered for the newly formed Polish Army, but his wounds were still not healed and he was rejected as a front-line officer. Instead, he became a staff officer in the Ministry of War Affairs in Warsaw. = Interwar period = After the Polish- Soviet War Sosabowski was promoted to Major and in 1922 he started his studies at the Higher Military School in Warsaw. After he finished his studies he was assigned to the Polish General Staff. Promoted to Lieutenant Colonel, in 1928 he was finally assigned to a front-line unit, the 75th Infantry Regiment, as commanding officer of a battalion. The following year he was assigned to the 3rd Podhale Rifles Regiment as its deputy commander. From 1930 he was also a professor of logistics at his alma mater. In 1937 Sosabowski was promoted to colonel and became the commanding officer of the 9th Polish Legions Infantry Regiment stationed in Zamo≈õƒá. In January 1939 he became the commander of the prestigious Warsaw-based 21st \\"Children of Warsaw\\" Infantry Regiment.  Invasion of Poland 1939 According to the Polish mobilisation scheme, Sosabowski's regiment was attached to the 8th Infantry Division under Col. . Shortly before the German invasion of Poland started his unit was moved from its garrison in the Warsaw Citadel to the area of Ciechan√≥w, where it was planned as a strategic reserve of the Modlin Army. On 2 September the division was moved towards M≈Çawa and in the early morning of the following day it entered combat in the Battle of M≈Çawa. Although the 21st Regiment managed to capture Przasnysz and its secondary objectives, the rest of the division was surrounded by the Wehrmacht and destroyed. After that Sosabowski ordered his troops to retreat towards Warsaw. On 8 September Sosabowski's unit reached the Modlin Fortress. The routed 8th Division was being reconstructed, but the 21st Regiment was attached to the corps led by general Juliusz Zulauf. After several days of defensive fights, the corps was moved to Warsaw, where it arrived on 15 September. Instantly upon arrival, Sosabowski was ordered to man the Groch√≥w and the Kamionek defensive area and defend Praga, the eastern borough of Warsaw, against the German 10th Infantry Division. During the Siege of Warsaw the forces of Sosabowski were outmanned and outgunned, but managed to hold all their objectives. When the general assault on Praga started on 16 September, the 21st Infantry Regiment managed to repel the attacks of German 23rd Infantry Regiment and then successfully counter-attacked and destroyed the enemy unit. After this success, Sosabowski was assigned to command all Polish troops fighting in the area of Groch√≥w. Despite constant bombardment and German attacks repeated every day, Sosabowski managed to hold his objectives at relatively low cost in manpower. On 26 September 1939, the forces led by Sosabowski bloodily repelled the last German attack, but two days later Warsaw capitulated. On 29 September, shortly before the Polish forces left Warsaw for German captivity, General Juliusz R√≥mmel awarded Col. Sosabowski and the whole 21st Infantry Regiment with the Virtuti Militari medal.  France  Following the Polish surrender, Sosabowski was made a prisoner of war and interned at a camp near ≈ªyrard√≥w. However, he escaped and remained in Warsaw under a false name, where he joined the Polish resistance. He was ordered to leave Poland and reached France to report on the situation in occupied Poland. After a long trip through Hungary and Romania, he arrived in Paris, where the Polish government in exile assigned him to the Polish 4th Infantry Division as the commanding officer of infantry. Initially, the French authorities were very reluctant to hand over the badly needed equipment and armament for the Polish unit. Sosabowski's soldiers had to train with pre- World War I weapons. In April 1940, the division was moved to a training camp in Parthenay and was finally handed the weapons awaited since January, but it was already too late to organise the division. Out of more than 11,000 soldiers, only 3,150 were given arms. Knowing this, the commander of the division General ordered his unit to withdraw towards the Atlantic coast. On 19 June 1940, Sosabowski with approximately 6,000 Polish soldiers arrived at La Pallice, whence they were evacuated to Great Britain.  Great Britain  Colonel Sosabowski, c. 1942 Upon his arrival in London, Sosabowski turned up at the Polish General Staff and was assigned to 4th Rifles Brigade that was to become a core of the future 4th Infantry Division. The unit was to be composed mainly of Polish Canadians, but it soon became apparent that there were not enough young Poles in Canada from which to create a division. Then, Sosabowski decided to transform his brigade into a Parachute Brigade, the first such unit in the Polish Army. The volunteers came from all the formations of the Polish Army. In Largo House in Fife, a training camp was built and the parachute training was started. Sosabowski himself passed the training and, at 49 years of age, made his first parachute jump. According to relations of Sosabowski's former subordinates, the colonel was a strict yet just commander. Impulsive and harsh, Sosabowski could not stand any opposition. This made the creation of a Polish parachute brigade possible, but also made contacts with his superiors problematic. In October 1942 the Brigade was ready for combat and was named the 1st Independent Parachute Brigade. Since the Polish General Staff planned to use the Brigade to assist a national uprising in Poland, the soldiers of the 1st Polish Para were to be the first element of the Polish Army in Exile to reach their homeland. Hence the unofficial motto of the unit: the shortest way (najkr√≥tszƒÖ drogƒÖ). In September 1943, Lieutenant-General Frederick Browning proposed that Sosabowski reform his unit into a division and fill the remaining posts with British troops. Sosabowski himself would be assigned to the newly formed division and promoted to general. However, Sosabowski refused. Nevertheless, on 15 June 1944 he was promoted to Brigadier General.  Warsaw Uprising  In early August 1944, news of the Warsaw Uprising arrived in Great Britain. The Brigade was ready to be dropped by parachute into Warsaw to aid their comrades from the underground Polish Home Army, who were fighting a desperate battle against overwhelming odds. However, the distance was too great for the transport aircraft to make a round trip and access to Soviet airfields was denied. The morale of the Polish troops suffered badly and many of the units verged on mutiny. The British staff threatened its Polish counterpart with disarmament of the Brigade, but Sosabowski retained control of his unit. Finally, Polish Commander in Chief Kazimierz Sosnkowski put the Brigade under British command, and the plan to send it to Warsaw was abandoned. It was not until after the war that General Sosabowski learnt that his son, , a medic and member of the Kedyw, had lost his sight during the uprising. Battle of Arnhem Gen. Sosabowski (left) with Lt-Gen Frederick Browning, commander of the British 1st Airborne Corps. During the planning for Operation Market Garden, Sosabowski expressed serious concerns regarding the feasibility of the mission. Among Sosabowski's concerns were the poorly conceived drop zones at Arnhem, the long distances between the landing zones and Arnhem Bridge and that the area would contain a greater German presence than British intelligence believed. Despite Sosabowski's concerns and warnings from the Dutch Resistance that two SS Panzer Division were in the operations area, Market Garden proceeded as planned. The Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade was among the Allied forces taking part in Market Garden. Due to a shortage of transport aircraft, the brigade was split into several parts before being dropped into the battle. A small part of the brigade with Sosabowski was parachuted near Driel on 19 September, but the rest of the brigade arrived only on 21 September at the distant town of Grave, falling directly on the waiting guns of the Germans camped in the area. The brigade's artillery was dropped with the British 1st Airborne Division, commanded by Major-General Roy Urquhart, while the howitzers were to arrive by sea, which prevented the brigade from being deployed effectively. Three times Sosabowski attempted to cross the Rhine to come to the assistance of the surrounded 1st Airborne Division. Unfortunately, the ferry they hoped to use had been sunk and the Poles attempting to cross the river in small rubber boats came under heavy fire. Even so, at least 200 men made it across the river and reinforced the embattled British paratroopers. Despite the difficult situation, at a staff meeting on 24 September, Sosabowski suggested that the battle could still be won. He proposed that the combined forces of XXX Corps, under Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks, and the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade should start an all-out assault on the German positions and try to break through the Rhine. This plan was not accepted, and during the last phase of the battle, on 25 and 26 September, Sosabowski led his men southwards, shielding the retreat of the remnants of the 1st Airborne Division. Casualties among the Polish units were high, approaching 40%, and were at least in part, the result of Lieutenant-General Browning's decision to drop the paratroops 7 kilometres from the bridge at Arnhem. After the battle, on 5 October 1944, Sosabowski received a letter from Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, commander of the Anglo-Canadian 21st Army Group, describing the Polish soldiers as having fought bravely and offering awards to ten of his soldiers. However, on 14 October 1944, Montgomery wrote another letter, this time to the British commanders, in which he scapegoated Sosabowski for the failure of Market Garden. Sosabowski was accused of criticizing Montgomery, and the Polish General Staff was forced to remove him as the commanding officer of his brigade on 27 December 1944. At the Moscow Conference in October 1944, a turning point came in Anglo-Polish relations. On Prime Minister Churchill's request, the Polish delegation arrived in Moscow on 12 October 1944. Upon arrival, Churchill told them to be present at the discussions between himself, Joseph Stalin and the Communist Polish Lublin Committee. Consequently, Churchill coerced Polish Prime Minister Stanis≈Çaw Miko≈Çajczyk into cooperating with Stalin's disciples, or else risk losing Britain's support for the remainder of the war. From the British perspective, any news that could be beneficial to their coercion tactics would be welcome. The information came on 16 October in a telegram to Field Marshal Sir Alan Brooke, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, who was present in Moscow as Churchill's military advisor.Source document (Imperial War museum, London) Telegram from Bernard Montgomery to Sir Alan Brooke (16 October 1944) The message stated that Sosabowski's brigade performed badly. Churchill could use this claim to put more pressure on Miko≈Çajczyk to cooperate, because it could be argued that one of his most valuable assets, Sosabowski's elite brigade, was no longer useful to the Allied war effort. Montgomery's telegram is exceptional to his behavior in that timeframe. Two days prior to the telegram he was praising the Polish contribution to the war, while six weeks later he awarded a Distinguished Service Order to General Stanis≈Çaw Maczek and decorated members of the Polish 1st Armoured Division.Pictures of this event available at the archive of the city of Breda (25 November 1944). Picture shows Montgomery decorating soldiers from the Polish 1st Armoured Division. In addition, war correspondents spoke highly of the Polish contribution to Market Garden in the same period as Montgomery was expressing his negative experiences, via Field Marshal Brooke, to Prime Minister Churchill.Richard Lamb, \\"Polish at Arnhem\\", in: \\"\\"The Times\\"\\" (25 February 1984) [unknown author], \\"Rescue party at Arnhem\\", in: The Times (14 November 1944) [unknown author], \\"2,000 men return from Arnhem\\", in: The Times (28 September 1944) and [unknown author], \\"Work of Polish Troops in Arnhem\\", in: The Times (9 October 1944). Sosabowski was eventually made the commander of rearguard troops and was demobilized in July 1948. He was portrayed by Gene Hackman in the 1977 war film A Bridge Too Far.  After the war  The resting place of General Sosabowski and his family, PowƒÖzki Military Cemetery, Warsaw Shortly after the war Sosabowski succeeded in evacuating his wife and only son from Poland. Like many other Polish wartime officers and soldiers who were unable to return to Communist Poland he settled in West London. He found a job as a factory worker at the CAV Electrics assembly plant in Acton. He died in London on 25 September 1967. It has been suggested that until his funeral at which his rank and achievements were read out, many of his friends and workmates in England were largely unaware of his military accomplishments. In 1969, Sosabowski's remains were returned to Poland, where he was reinterred at PowƒÖzki Military Cemetery in Warsaw. In The Hague, on 31 May 2006, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands awarded the Military Order of William to the 1st Independent Polish Parachute Brigade. The brigade's commander, Sosabowski, was posthumously awarded the \\"Bronze Lion\\". In part this was the result of a Dutch TV documentary depicting the brigade as having played a far more significant role in Market Garden than had been hitherto acknowledged. In this film by Geertjan Lassche, Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands said the Poles deserved to be honoured with at least a medal. The following day, on 1 June, a ceremony was held at Driel, the town where the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade fought. Among the speakers at the ceremony were the mayor of Overbetuwe, as well as Sosabowski's grandson and great-grandson. In the summer of 2012 1st Airborne Major Tony Hibbert made a video appeal for Sosabowski to be pardoned and honoured. His bust was unveiled on 1 September 2013 in Krak√≥w's Jordan Park. Sosabowski is one of many Polish historical figures honoured in the Park.  Awards  He was awarded many military honours, including: * 40px Knight's Cross of the Virtuti Militari * 40px Commander's Cross with Star of the Order of Polonia Restituta (posthumously, 1988) * 40px Cross of Independence * 40px Polish Cross of Valour * 40px Gold Cross of Merit with Swords * 40px Honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire * 40px Bronze Lion Award for Bravery (Netherlands, posthumously, 2006) Footnotes  See also  * Polish contribution to World War II * Polish Armed Forces in the West * Cichociemni * Stanis≈Çaw Maczek * Western betrayal * W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski References  * * Honor Genera≈Ça ‚Äì documentary TV POLONIA 2008, directed by Joanna Pieciukiewicz External links * History of the family Sosabowski * A Biography * *Market Garden 1944‚ÄîMajor Tony Hibbert‚Äôs call to honour Polish General Sosabowski Ten- minute video interview, June 2012.

It is the administrative, economic, and cultural center of Andijan Region. Andijan is located in the south-eastern edge of the Fergana Valley near Uzbekistan's border with Kyrgyzstan. Andijan is one of the oldest cities in the Fergana Valley. In some parts of the city, archeologists have found items dating back to the 7th and 8th centuries. Historically, Andijan was an important city on the Silk Road. The city is perhaps best known as the birthplace of Babur who, following a series of setbacks, finally succeeded in laying the basis for the Mughal dynasty in the Indian subcontinent and became the first Mughal emperor. Andijan also gained notoriety in 2005 when government forces opened fire on protestors, killing hundreds in what came to be known as the Andijan Massacre. Andijan was developed into an important industrial city during the Soviet era. Manufactured goods produced in the city include chemicals, domestic appliances, electronics, foodstuffs, furniture, plows, pumps, shoes, spare parts for farming machines, various engineering tools, and wheelchairs. History = Toponymy = The origin of the name of the city is uncertain. Arab geographers of the 10th century referred to Andijan as \\"Andukan,\\" \\"Andugan,\\" or \\"Andigan.\\" The traditional explanation links the name of the city to the Turkic tribal names Andi and Adoq/Azoq. = Early and recent history = Andijan is one of the oldest cities in the Fergana Valley. Marhamat city of Andijan The ruins of Ershi, the capital of the Davan (Parkana) state, with more than 70 cities with a rich and dense population of the V - IV and IV centuries BC. In some parts of the city, archeologists have found items dating back to the 7th and 8th centuries. Historically, Andijan was an important city on the Silk Road. The city is perhaps best known as the birthplace of Babur who, following a series of setbacks, finally succeeded in laying the basis for the Mughal dynasty in the Indian Subcontinent and became the first Mughal emperor. After the formation of the Khanate of Kokand in the 18th century, the capital was moved from Andijan to Kokand. In the mid-19th century, the Russian Empire began occupying the area of present-day Central Asia. In 1876, the Russians conquered the Khanate of Kokand and the city of Andijan along with it. Andijan was the center and flashpoint of the Andijan Uprising of 1898 in which the followers of Sufi leader Madali Ishan attacked the Russian barracks in the city, killing 22 and injuring 16-20 more. In retaliation, 18 of the participants were hanged and 360 exiled. On 16 December 1902, much of the city was leveled by a severe earthquake which destroyed up to 30,000 homes in the region and killed as many as 4,500 residents. After Soviet rule was established in Andijan in 1917, the city quickly became an important industrial city in the Uzbek SSR. =Modern history= During the Soviet demarcation of Central Asia, Andijan was separated from its historical hinterland as the Ferghana Valley was divided among three separate Soviet republics. Andijan itself became part of the Uzbek SSR. During World War II, many Soviet citizens were evacuated to Andijan and the surrounding towns. Of the Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi-occupied Poland and banished by the Soviets to Siberia and Central Asia, some relocated to Andijan starting in 1941. In the 1990s, Andijan and the surrounding region became politically unstable. Poverty and an upsurge in Islamic fundamentalism produced tensions in the region. The town, and the region as a whole, suffered a severe economic decline following the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. Repeated border closures badly damaged the local economy, worsening the already widespread poverty of Andijan's inhabitants. May 2005 massacre On 13 May 2005, Uzbekistan's military opened fire on a mass of people who were protesting against poor living conditions and corrupt government. The estimates of those killed on 13 May range from 187, the official count of the government, to several hundred. A defector from the SNB alleged that 1,500 were killed. The bodies of many of those who died were allegedly hidden in mass graves following the massacre. The Uzbek government at first stated that the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan organized the unrest and that the protesters were members of Hizb ut-Tahrir. Critics have argued that the radical Islamist label has been just a pretext for maintaining a repressive regime in the country. Whether troops fired indiscriminately to prevent a colour revolution or acted legitimately to quell a prison break is also disputed. Another theory is that the dispute was really an inter-clan struggle for state power. The Uzbek government eventually acknowledged that poor economic conditions in the region and popular resentment played a role in the uprising. Geography Andijan is located above sea level in the south-eastern edge of the Fergana Valley near Uzbekistan's border with Kyrgyzstan. By road it is northeast of Asaka and southeast of Namangan. Andijonsoy flows along the city. Food: Andijan is also known with fascinating dishes, one of the most popular food is Plov also known (Osh) in the local language. Nevertheless, there are some other delicious foods as well such as Somsa, Monti and Dolma in the local language. However, Andijan is also known for its dance called Andijan polka and it has been reported that this dance history goes all the way back to the old centuries. =Climate= Andijan has a cold semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen climate classification BSk) with cold winters and hot summers, rendering a very continental nature, although winters are milder than one might expect for a location in Central Asia. Rainfall is generally light and erratic. Summers are particularly dry. Demographics In 2000, Andijan had a population of 333,400. Representatives of many ethnic groups can be found in the city. Uzbeks are the largest ethnic group, followed by Tajiks. Economy Andijan has been an important craft and trade center in the Fergana Valley since the 15th century. After annexation by the Russians in 1876, the economy of the city started to grow significantly. Several industrial plants were built in Andijan after the city was connected with Russia with a railway line in 1889. Several hospitals, pharmacies, banks, and printing houses were established in the city during that period. After Soviet rule was established in late December 1917, both light and heavy industries developed significantly. Andijan became the first city in Uzbekistan to be fully supplied with natural gas. Andijan remains an important industrial city in independent Uzbekistan. There are 48 large industrial plants and about 3,000 small and medium enterprises in the city. Manufactured goods produced in the city include chemicals, domestic appliances, electronics, foodstuffs, furniture, plows, pumps, shoes, spare parts for farming machines, various engineering tools, and wheelchairs. Andijan is also home to over 50 international companies, five of which produce spare parts for GM Uzbekistan.  Education  There are four higher education institutions in Andijan City. Andijan state university, Andijan medical institute, Andijan machine-building institute and Andijan branch Tashkent state agrarian university. The Andijan Medical Institute is the largest of the four. The city is also home to four colleges, one academic lyceum, 21 vocational schools, 47 secondary schools, three music and art schools, nine sports schools, and 86 kindergartens.

Food and beverage pantries serve in an ancillary capacity to the kitchen. The word \\"pantry\\" derives from the same source as the Old French term ; that is from , the French form of the Latin , \\"bread\\". History in Europe and United States =Late Middle Ages= In a late medieval hall, there were separate rooms for the various service functions and food storage. A pantry was where bread was kept and food preparation associated with it was done. The head of the office responsible for this room was referred to as a pantler. There were similar rooms for storage of bacon and other meats (larder), alcoholic beverages (buttery) (known for the \\"butts\\" of barrels stored there), and cooking (kitchen). Nineteenth-century pantry in Museu Rom√†ntic Can Papiol in Vilanova i la Geltr√∫ =Colonial era= In the United States, pantries evolved from early Colonial American \\"butteries\\", built in a cold north corner of a Colonial home (more commonly referred to and spelled as \\"butt'ry\\"), into a variety of pantries in self-sufficient farmsteads. Butler's pantries, or china pantries, were built between the dining room and kitchen of a middle- class English or American home, especially in the latter part of the 19th into the early 20th centuries. Great estates, such as the Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina or Stan Hywet Hall in Akron, Ohio, had large warrens of pantries and other domestic \\"offices\\", echoing their British \\"Great House\\" counterparts. =Victorian era= By the Victorian era, large houses and estates in Britain maintained the use of separate rooms, each one dedicated to a distinct stages of food preparation and cleanup. The kitchen was for cooking, while food was stored in a storeroom, pantry or cellar. Meat preparation before cooking was done in a larder (remember that often in these large houses game would come in undressed, fish unfilleted and meat in half or quarter carcasses), and vegetable cleaning and preparation would be done in the scullery. Dishwashing was done in a scullery or butler's pantry, \\"depending on the type of dish and level of dirt\\". Since the scullery was the room with running water, it had a sink, and it was where the messiest food preparation took place, such as cleaning fish and cutting raw meat. The pantry was where tableware was stored, such as china, glassware, and silverware. If the pantry had a sink for washing tableware, it was a wooden sink lined with lead, to prevent chipping the china and glassware while they were washed. In some middle-class houses, the larder, pantry, and storeroom might simply be large wooden cupboards, each with its exclusive purpose. Types = Asian pantry = Traditionally, kitchens in Asia have been more open-format than those of the West. The function of the pantry was generally served by wooden cabinetry. For example, in Japan, a kitchen cabinet is called a \\"mizuya tansu\\". A substantial tradition of woodworking and cabinetry in general developed in Japan, especially throughout the Tokugawa period. A huge number of designs for tansu (chests or cabinets) were made, each tailored towards one specific purpose or another. The idea is very similar to that of the Hoosier cabinet, with a wide variety of functions being served by specific design innovations. =Butler's pantry= Butler's pantry at the Little White House A butler's pantry or serving pantry is a utility room in a large house, primarily used to store serving items, rather than food. Traditionally, a butler's pantry was used for cleaning, counting, and storage of silver; European butlers often slept in the pantry, as their job was to keep the silver under lock and key. The merchant's account books and wine log may also have been kept in there. The room would be used by the butler and other domestic staff; it is often called a butler's pantry even in households where there is no butler. In modern homes, butler's pantries are usually located in transitional spaces between kitchens and dining rooms and are used as staging areas for serving meals. They commonly contain countertops, as well as storage for candles, serving pieces, table linens, tableware, wine, and other dining room articles. More elaborate versions may include dishwashers, refrigerators, or sinks. Butler's pantries have become popular in recent times. = Cold pantry = Cold-pantry exterior vents Some food, such as butter, eggs, milk, and such need to be kept cool. Before modern refrigeration was available, iceboxes were popular. However, the problem with an icebox was that the cabinet housing it was large, but the actual refrigerated space was quite small, so a clever and innovative solution was invented, the \\"cold pantry\\", sometimes called a \\"California cooler\\". The cold pantry usually consisted of a cabinet or cupboard with wooden-slat shelves (for air circulation). An opening near the top vented to the outside, either through the roof or high out the wall. A second opening near the bottom vented also to the outside, but low near the ground and usually on the north side of the house, where the air was cooler. As the air in the pantry warmed, it rose, escaping through the upper vent. This in turn drew cooler air in from the lower vent, providing constant circulation of cooler air. In the summertime, the temperatures in the cold pantry would usually hover several degrees lower than the ambient temperature in the house, while in the wintertime, the temperature in the cold pantry would be considerably lower than that in the house. A California cooler in the Spooner Ranch House in Monta√±a de Oro State Park A cold pantry was the perfect place to keep foodstocks that did not necessarily need to be kept refrigerated. Breads, butter, cheesecakes, eggs, pastries, and pie were common foodstocks kept in a cold pantry. Vegetables could be brought up from the root cellar in smaller amounts and stored in the cold pantry until ready to use. With space in the icebox at a premium, the cold pantry was a great place to store fresh berries and fruit. = Hoosier cabinet = First developed in the early 1900s by the Hoosier Manufacturing Company in New Castle, Indiana, and popular into the 1930s, the Hoosier cabinet and its many imitators soon became an essential fixture in American kitchens. Often billed as a \\"pantry and kitchen in one\\", the Hoosier brought the ease and readiness of a pantry, with its many storage spaces and working counter, right into the kitchen. It was sold in catalogues and through a unique sales program geared towards farm wives. Today, the Hoosier cabinet is a much sought-after domestic icon and widely reproduced.  Books Chapters of earlier books, particularly written during the era of domestic science and home economics in the latter half of the 19th century, featured how to furnish, keep, and clean a pantry. Catharine E. Beecher and Harriet Beecher Stowe, in their seminal The American Woman's Home (1869), advocated the elimination of the pantry by installing pantry shelving and cabinetry in the kitchen. This idea did not take hold in American households until a century later, by which time the pantry had become a floor- to-ceiling cabinet in the post-War kitchen. During the Victorian era and until the Second World War, when housing changed considerably, pantries were commonplace in virtually all American homes. This was because kitchens were small and strictly utilitarian, and not the domestic, often well-appointed, center of the home enjoyed today or in Colonial times. Thus, pantries were important workspaces with their built-in shelving, cupboards and countertops. In the last chapter of These Happy Golden Years, Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote a descriptive account of the pantry that Almanzo Wilder built for her in their first home together in DeSmet, South Dakota. It details a working farmhouse pantry in great detail, which she sees for the first time after her marriage to Wilder and subsequent journey to their new home. Pantry raids were often common themes in children's literature and early 20th century advertising. Perhaps the most famous pantry incident in literature was when Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer had to do penance for getting into his Aunt Polly's jam in her pantry: as punishment, he had to whitewash her fence.

Its influence has been most felt in the electronic body music and electro-industrial\\"Claus Larsen fronts one of Europe's leading Electro- Industrial bands.\\" Mick Mercer, The Hex Files: The Goth Bible, Woodstock: The Overlook Press, 1997, p. 24. genres. Le√¶ther Strip was one of the earliest and most prominent acts on Germany's now defunct Zoth Ommog record label. For distribution outside of Europe, the music has been licensed to the U.S. labels Cleopatra Records and Metropolis Records. After the demise of Zoth Ommog in 1999, Larsen signed to Bloodline Records, which only released a single before also going out of business. In 2005, Le√¶ther Strip signed with the Belgian- based label Alfa Matrix. On June 3, 2011, Larsen announced his split from Alfa Matrix in order to self-release future material.:News: Le√¶ther Strip Leaves Alfa Matrix Records COMA Music Magazine History According to founder Claus Larsen, \\"Le√¶ther Strip is, and always will be, only him.\\" Larsen was born on November 13, 1967 in Aalborg, Denmark. He first released music under the name of Le√¶ther Strip in 1989. However, his 1995 release G.A.W.M.U.S. (Getting Away With Murder U. S.) included two early demos from 1982 and 1984, with the latter forming the unknown beginning of the band according to an interview conducted with Claus Larsen. In 1991, Larsen created a side-project called Klute in which he also remained the sole member. In 1994, Larsen changed the sound of Le√¶ther Strip, with the release of a synthesized semi classical album. Conceived as a soundtrack to a fictional film, it was named Serenade for the Dead. The releases since then have reincorporated electronic dance elements, and have redefined Le√¶ther Strip into what Larsen calls \\"symphonic electro\\". Le√¶ther Strip remained silent for several years after the release of the single Carry Me in 2000 and the official band website, which once contained a wealth of information regarding the project, was taken offline. In foreshadowing the return of his band, Larsen's remix of the band KiEw's song Graograman on the Diskette EP (2003) states at the beginning of the song, in a sing-song computer-generated voice, \\"Le√¶ther Strip will return for more electronic mayhem\\". In an interview conducted late 2005, Larsen revealed that label issues, as well as personal concerns, caused the dormancy of the band during the 2000 - 2005 period. October 28, 2005, marked the official return of Le√¶ther Strip with the EP release Suicide Bombers on the Alfa Matrix label. Claus Larsen opened a blog to inform fans of his current activities and progress on the project. A string of releases followed including the 2-CD album After the Devastation, and the 2006 EP releases Walking on Volcanos and F√¶tish. Also in 2006, Claus Larsen released a free song via his MySpace page, a remix of Frank Tovey taught me things. The song was subsequently downloaded over 10,000 times. On April 13 2007, Le√¶ther Strip released the album The Giant Minutes to the Dawn. It was made available in several editions, including a special limited edition box-set which includes the band's first DVD release. According to various reviewers, the album constituted the \\"true\\" return of the band to classic Le√¶ther Strip form. In a post to his MySpace blog made in late November 2008, Larsen announced his intention to develop a live show for a small run of exclusive engagements in 2009. Two shows took place in Denmark in April 2009, and Leaether Strip has been confirmed to perform at the Power Strip Festival in the USA and the Amphi Festival in Germany during Summer 2009. Via a video teaser on YouTube Claus Larsen announced that the first Leaether Strip album, The Pleasure of Penetration, would be re-released as a remastered double CD set on November 13, 2007, Claus Larsen's birthday, under the title Retention n¬∞1. The release is part of an ongoing box series through which Claus Larsen will re-release his complete back-catalogue via the Belgian label Alfa Matrix. Each re-release will have both the fully remastered version of the original album on disc 1 and on the second disc, a totally re-written and reinterpretation of some selected songs from the original album by Leaether Strip himself re-recorded with current technologies. The original track-list on disc 1 has been extended to 15 tracks with the addition of early 12\\" tracks and other rarities of the period. Le√¶ther Strip live at the E-tropolis Festival 2013, Berlin: Claus Larsen Leather Strip live in 2011 Larsen's lyrics for Leaether Strip are often frank and direct, sometimes to the point of being hostile. Political songs include the anti-Nazi song \\"AEighty AEight\\" which contains the chorus \\"You are not human / You are not soldiers\\" as well as the song \\"Suicide Bombers\\" (On the Suicide Bombers EP) with its chorus question, \\"Who told you to die that way?\\" More frequently, Larsen explores his own personal issues in the same open fashion, resulting in many tracks that are simultaneously aggressive and introspective.

Eight allotropes of carbon: a) diamond, b) graphite, c) lonsdaleite, d) C60 buckminsterfullerene, e) C540, Fullerite f) C70, g) amorphous carbon, h) zig-zag single-walled carbon nanotube. Missing: cyclocarbon, carbon nanobuds, schwarzites, glassy carbon, and linear acetylenic carbon (carbyne) Carbon is capable of forming many allotropes (structurally different forms of the same element) due to its valency. Well-known forms of carbon include diamond and graphite. In recent decades, many more allotropes have been discovered and researched including ball shapes such as buckminsterfullerene and sheets such as graphene. Larger scale structures of carbon include nanotubes, nanobuds and nanoribbons. Other unusual forms of carbon exist at very high temperatures or extreme pressures. Around 500 hypothetical 3-periodic allotropes of carbon are known at the present time, according to the Samara Carbon Allotrope Database (SACADA). Diamond Diamond is a well known allotrope of carbon. The hardness and high dispersion of light of diamond make it useful for both industrial applications and jewelry. Diamond is the hardest known natural mineral. This makes it an excellent abrasive and makes it hold polish and luster extremely well. No known naturally occurring substance can cut (or even scratch) a diamond, except another diamond. The market for industrial-grade diamonds operates much differently from its gem-grade counterpart. Industrial diamonds are valued mostly for their hardness and heat conductivity, making many of the gemological characteristics of diamond, including clarity and color, mostly irrelevant. This helps explain why 80% of mined diamonds (equal to about 100 million carats or 20 tonnes annually) are unsuitable for use as gemstones and known as bort, are destined for industrial use. In addition to mined diamonds, synthetic diamonds found industrial applications almost immediately after their invention in the 1950s; another 400 million carats (80 tonnes) of synthetic diamonds are produced annually for industrial use, which is nearly four times the mass of natural diamonds mined over the same period. The dominant industrial use of diamond is cutting, drilling (drill bits), grinding (diamond edged cutters), and polishing. Most uses of diamonds in these technologies do not require large diamonds; in fact, most diamonds that are not gem-quality can find an industrial use. Diamonds are embedded in drill tips or saw blades, or ground into a powder for use in grinding and polishing applications (due to its extraordinary hardness). Specialized applications include use in laboratories as containment for high pressure experiments (see diamond anvil), high-performance bearings, and limited use in specialized windows of technical apparatuses. With the continuing advances being made in the production of synthetic diamond, future applications are beginning to become feasible. Garnering much excitement is the possible use of diamond as a semiconductor suitable to build microchips from, or the use of diamond as a heat sink in electronics. Significant research efforts in Japan, Europe, and the United States are under way to capitalize on the potential offered by diamond's unique material properties, combined with increased quality and quantity of supply starting to become available from synthetic diamond manufacturers. Each carbon atom in a diamond is covalently bonded to four other carbons in a tetrahedron. These tetrahedrons together form a 3-dimensional network of six-membered carbon rings (similar to cyclohexane), in the chair conformation, allowing for zero bond angle strain. This stable network of covalent bonds and hexagonal rings is the reason that diamond is so strong. Although graphite is the most stable allotrope of carbon under standard laboratory conditions (273 or 298 K, 1 atm), a recent computational study indicated that under idealized conditions (T = 0, p = 0), diamond is the most stable allotrope by 1.1 kJ/mol compared to graphite. Graphite Graphite, named by Abraham Gottlob Werner in 1789, from the Greek Œ≥œÅŒ¨œÜŒµŒπŒΩ (, \\"to draw/write\\", for its use in pencils) is one of the most common allotropes of carbon. Unlike diamond, graphite is an electrical conductor. Thus, it can be used in, for instance, electrical arc lamp electrodes. Likewise, under standard conditions, graphite is the most stable form of carbon. Therefore, it is used in thermochemistry as the standard state for defining the heat of formation of carbon compounds. Graphite conducts electricity, due to delocalization of the pi bond electrons above and below the planes of the carbon atoms. These electrons are free to move, so are able to conduct electricity. However, the electricity is only conducted along the plane of the layers. In diamond, all four outer electrons of each carbon atom are 'localized' between the atoms in covalent bonding. The movement of electrons is restricted and diamond does not conduct an electric current. In graphite, each carbon atom uses only 3 of its 4 outer energy level electrons in covalently bonding to three other carbon atoms in a plane. Each carbon atom contributes one electron to a delocalized system of electrons that is also a part of the chemical bonding. The delocalized electrons are free to move throughout the plane. For this reason, graphite conducts electricity along the planes of carbon atoms, but does not conduct electricity in a direction at right angles to the plane. Graphite powder is used as a dry lubricant. Although it might be thought that this industrially important property is due entirely to the loose interlamellar coupling between sheets in the structure, in fact in a vacuum environment (such as in technologies for use in space), graphite was found to be a very poor lubricant. This fact led to the discovery that graphite's lubricity is due to adsorbed air and water between the layers, unlike other layered dry lubricants such as molybdenum disulfide. Recent studies suggest that an effect called superlubricity can also account for this effect. When a large number of crystallographic defects (physical) bind these planes together, graphite loses its lubrication properties and becomes pyrolytic carbon, a useful material in blood-contacting implants such as prosthetic heart valves. Graphite is the most stable allotrope of carbon. Contrary to popular belief, high-purity graphite does not readily burn, even at elevated temperatures.Glowing nuclear reactor graphite 2. YouTube (2007-11-07). Retrieved on 2015-10-22. For this reason, it is used in nuclear reactors and for high-temperature crucibles for melting metals.Crucibles, Artisan Foundry Shop. Artisanfoundry.co.uk. Retrieved on 2015-10-22. At very high temperatures and pressures (roughly 2000 ¬∞C and 5 GPa), it can be transformed into diamond. Natural and crystalline graphites are not often used in pure form as structural materials due to their shear-planes, brittleness and inconsistent mechanical properties. In its pure glassy (isotropic) synthetic forms, pyrolytic graphite and carbon fiber graphite are extremely strong, heat-resistant (to 3000 ¬∞C) materials, used in reentry shields for missile nosecones, solid rocket engines, high temperature reactors, brake shoes and electric motor brushes. Intumescent or expandable graphites are used in fire seals, fitted around the perimeter of a fire door. During a fire the graphite intumesces (expands and chars) to resist fire penetration and prevent the spread of fumes. A typical start expansion temperature (SET) is between 150 and 300 ¬∞C. Density: graphite's specific gravity is 2.3, which makes it lighter than diamonds. Chemical activity: it is slightly more reactive than diamond. This is because the reactants are able to penetrate between the hexagonal layers of carbon atoms in graphite. It is unaffected by ordinary solvents, dilute acids, or fused alkalis. However, chromic acid oxidizes it to carbon dioxide. =Graphene= A single layer of graphite is called graphene and has extraordinary electrical, thermal, and physical properties. It can be produced by epitaxy on an insulating or conducting substrate or by mechanical exfoliation (repeated peeling) from graphite. Its applications may include replacing silicon in high-performance electronic devices. With two layers stacked, bilayer graphene results with different properties. =Graphenylene= Graphenylene is a single layer carbon material with biphenylene-like subunits as basis in its hexagonal lattice structure. It is also known as biphenylene-carbon. =AA'-graphite= AA'-graphite is an allotrope of carbon similar to graphite, but where the layers are positioned differently to each other as compared to the order in graphite. = Diamane = Diamane is a 2D form of diamond. It can be made via high pressures, but without that pressure, the material reverts to graphene. Another technique is to add hydrogen atoms but those bonds are weak. Using fluorine (xenon- difluoride) instead brings the layers closer together, strengthening the bonds. This is called f-diamane. Amorphous carbon Amorphous carbon is the name used for carbon that does not have any crystalline structure. As with all glassy materials, some short-range order can be observed, but there is no long-range pattern of atomic positions. While entirely amorphous carbon can be produced, most amorphous carbon actually contains microscopic crystals of graphite-like, or even diamond-like carbon. Coal and soot or carbon black are informally called amorphous carbon. However, they are products of pyrolysis (the process of decomposing a substance by the action of heat), which does not produce true amorphous carbon under normal conditions. Nanocarbons =Buckminsterfullerenes= The buckminsterfullerenes, or usually just fullerenes or buckyballs for short, were discovered in 1985 by a team of scientists from Rice University and the University of Sussex, three of whom were awarded the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. They are named for the resemblance to the geodesic structures devised by Richard Buckminster \\"Bucky\\" Fuller. Fullerenes are positively curved molecules of varying sizes composed entirely of carbon, which take the form of a hollow sphere, ellipsoid, or tube. As of the early twenty-first century, the chemical and physical properties of fullerenes are still under heavy study, in both pure and applied research labs. In April 2003, fullerenes were under study for potential medicinal use ‚Äî binding specific antibiotics to the structure to target resistant bacteria and even target certain cancer cells such as melanoma. =Carbon nanotubes= Carbon nanotubes, also called buckytubes, are cylindrical carbon molecules with novel properties that make them potentially useful in a wide variety of applications (e.g., nano-electronics, optics, materials applications, etc.). They exhibit extraordinary strength, unique electrical properties, and are efficient conductors of heat. Inorganic nanotubes have also been synthesized. A nanotube is a member of the fullerene structural family, which also includes buckyballs. Whereas buckyballs are spherical in shape, a nanotube is cylindrical, with at least one end typically capped with a hemisphere of the buckyball structure. Their name is derived from their size, since the diameter of a nanotube is on the order of a few nanometers (approximately 50,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair), while they can be up to several centimeters in length. There are two main types of nanotubes: single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) and multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs). =Carbon nanobuds= Computer models of stable nanobud structures Carbon nanobuds are a newly discovered allotrope of carbon in which fullerene like \\"buds\\" are covalently attached to the outer sidewalls of the carbon nanotubes. This hybrid material has useful properties of both fullerenes and carbon nanotubes. For instance, they have been found to be exceptionally good field emitters. = Schwarzites = Schwarzites are negatively curved carbon surfaces originally proposed by decorating triply periodic minimal surfaces with carbon atoms. The geometric topology of the structure is determined by the presence of ring defects, such as heptagons and octagons, to graphene's hexagonal lattice. (Negative curvature bends surfaces outwards like a saddle rather than bending inwards like a sphere.) Recent work has proposed Zeolite-templated carbons (ZTCs) may be Schwarzites. The name, ZTC, derives from their origin inside the pores of zeolites, crystalline silicon dioxide minerals. A vapor of carbon-containing molecules is injected into the zeolite, where the carbon gathers on the pores' walls, creating the negative curve. Dissolving the zeolite leaves the carbon. A team generated structures by decorating the pores of a zeolite with carbon through a Monte Carlo method. Some of these structures were recognized as Schwarzites and they proposed a route to their synthesis. Glassy carbon A large sample of glassy carbon. Glassy carbon or vitreous carbon is a class of non-graphitizing carbon widely used as an electrode material in electrochemistry, as well as for high-temperature crucibles and as a component of some prosthetic devices. It was first produced by Bernard Redfern in the mid-1950s at the laboratories of The Carborundum Company, Manchester, UK. He had set out to develop a polymer matrix to mirror a diamond structure and discovered a resole (phenolic) resin that would, with special preparation, set without a catalyst. Using this resin the first glassy carbon was produced. The preparation of glassy carbon involves subjecting the organic precursors to a series of heat treatments at temperatures up to 3000 ¬∞C. Unlike many non-graphitizing carbons, they are impermeable to gases and are chemically extremely inert, especially those prepared at very high temperatures. It has been demonstrated that the rates of oxidation of certain glassy carbons in oxygen, carbon dioxide or water vapor are lower than those of any other carbon. They are also highly resistant to attack by acids. Thus, while normal graphite is reduced to a powder by a mixture of concentrated sulfuric and nitric acids at room temperature, glassy carbon is unaffected by such treatment, even after several months. Atomic and diatomic carbon Under certain conditions, carbon can be found in its atomic form. It is formed by passing large electric currents through carbon under very low pressures. It is extremely unstable, but it is an intermittent product used in the creation of carbenes.Reactions of Atomic Carbon with Acid Chlorides. None. Retrieved on 2011-11-23. Diatomic carbon can also be found under certain conditions. It is often detected via spectroscopy in extraterrestrial bodies, including comets and certain stars.Green Comet Approaches Earth.

Rode and co-workers at the Australian National University in Canberra. It consists of a low-density cluster-assembly of carbon atoms strung together in a loose three-dimensional web. Each cluster is about 6 nanometers wide and consists of about 4000 carbon atoms linked in graphite-like sheets that are given negative curvature by the inclusion of heptagons among the regular hexagonal pattern. This is the opposite of what happens in the case of buckminsterfullerenes, in which carbon sheets are given positive curvature by the inclusion of pentagons. The large-scale structure of carbon nanofoam is similar to that of an aerogel, but with 1% of the density of previously produced carbon aerogels ‚Äì only a few times the density of air at sea level. Unlike carbon aerogels, carbon nanofoam is a poor electrical conductor. Carbide-derived carbon Carbide-derived carbon (CDC) is a family of carbon materials with different surface geometries and carbon ordering that are produced via selective removal of metals from metal carbide precursors, such as TiC, SiC, Ti3AlC2, Mo2C, etc. This synthesis is accomplished using chlorine treatment, hydrothermal synthesis, or high-temperature selective metal desorption under vacuum. Depending on the synthesis method, carbide precursor, and reaction parameters, multiple carbon allotropes can be achieved, including endohedral particles composed of predominantly amorphous carbon, carbon nanotubes, epitaxial graphene, nanocrystalline diamond, onion- like carbon, and graphitic ribbons, barrels, and horns. These structures exhibit high porosity and specific surface areas, with highly tunable pore diameters, making them promising materials for supercapacitor-based energy storage, water filtration and capacitive desalinization, catalyst support, and cytokine removal. Lonsdaleite (hexagonal diamond) Lonsdaleite is a hexagonal allotrope of the carbon allotrope diamond, believed to form from graphite present in meteorites upon their impact to Earth. The great heat and stress of the impact transforms the graphite into diamond, but retains graphite's hexagonal crystal lattice. Hexagonal diamond has also been synthesized in the laboratory, by compressing and heating graphite either in a static press or using explosives. It can also be produced by the thermal decomposition of a polymer, poly(hydridocarbyne), at atmospheric pressure, under inert gas atmosphere (e.g. argon, nitrogen), starting at temperature .

Total-energy calculations demonstrate that D-carbon is energetically more favorable than the previously proposed T6 structure (with 6 atoms per cell) as well as many others. * Chaoite is a mineral believed to have been formed in meteorite impacts. It has been described as slightly harder than graphite with a reflection color of grey to white. However, the existence of carbyne phases is disputed ‚Äì see the entry on chaoite for details. * Metallic carbon: Theoretical studies have shown that there are regions in the phase diagram, at extremely high pressures, where carbon has metallic character. * bcc-carbon: At ultrahigh pressures of above 1000 GPa, diamond is predicted to transform into the so-called C8 structure, a body-centered cubic structure with 8 atoms in the unit cell. This cubic carbon phase might have importance in astrophysics. Its structure is known in one of the metastable phases of silicon and is similar to cubane. Superdense and superhard material resembling this phase has been synthesized and published in 1979 and 2008. The structure of this phase was proposed in 2012 as carbon sodalite. * bct-carbon: Body- centered tetragonal carbon proposed by theorists in 2010Wolfram Demonstrations Project.

Its structure was theorized in 2006, then in 2009 it was related to those experimental observations. Many structural candidates, including bct- carbon, were proposed to be equally compatible with experimental data available at the time, until in 2012 it was theoretically proven that this structure is kinetically likeliest to form from graphite. High-resolution data appeared shortly after, demonstrating that among all structure candidates only M-carbon is compatible with experiment. * Q-carbon: Ferromagnetic carbon discovered in 2015. * T-carbon: Every carbon atom in diamond is replaced with a carbon tetrahedron (hence 'T-carbon').

Notably, it is harder than steel, as conductive as stainless steel, highly reflective and ferromagnetic, behaving as a permanent magnet at temperatures up to 125 ¬∞C. Variability of carbon Diamond and graphite are two allotropes of carbon: pure forms of the same element that differ in structure. The system of carbon allotropes spans an astounding range of extremes, considering that they are all merely structural formations of the same element. Between diamond and graphite: *Diamond crystallizes in the cubic system but graphite crystallizes in the hexagonal system. *Diamond is clear and transparent, but graphite is black and opaque. *Diamond is the hardest mineral known (10 on the Mohs scale), but graphite is one of the softest (1‚Äì2 on Mohs scale). *Diamond is the ultimate abrasive, but graphite is soft and is a very good lubricant. *Diamond is an excellent electrical insulator, but graphite is an excellent conductor. *Diamond is an excellent thermal conductor, but some forms of graphite are used for thermal insulation (for example heat shields and firebreaks). *At standard temperature and pressure, graphite is the thermodynamically stable form. Thus diamonds do not exist forever. The conversion from diamond to graphite, however, has a very high activation energy and is therefore extremely slow. Despite the hardness of diamonds, the chemical bonds that hold the carbon atoms in diamonds together are actually weaker than those that hold together graphite. The difference is that in diamond, the bonds form an inflexible three-dimensional lattice. In graphite, the atoms are tightly bonded into sheets, but the sheets can slide easily over each other, making graphite soft.

Plot introduction The story follows the bird throughout a year during its migration to South America and return to the Canadian Arctic in search of a mate. Although somewhat anthropomorphic in parts, the book paints a realistic and detailed picture of this bird's life and behaviour. The book may have been somewhat premature in that there were confirmed sightings of this bird in 1963 and there were a number of unconfirmed sightings after that date. However, this bird may now be extinct. Television adaptation The book was made into an animated film by Hanna-Barbera Productions.

An experienced politician, he briefly worked as a teacher before entering politics in 1951; and was elected into the House of Representatives in 1954. At various times between 1958 through independence of Nigeria in 1960 and 1975, he held a cabinet post as a federal commissioner or as a federal minister. Early years Shehu Usman Shagari was born on February 25 1925 in Shagari to a Fulani family. Shagari was founded by his great-grandfather, Ahmadu Rufa'i.Pofile of Shehu Shagari He was raised in a polygamous family, and was the sixth child born into the family. His father, Aliyu Shagari, was the Magajin Shagari (magaji means village head). Prior to becoming Magajin Shagari, Aliyu was a farmer, trader and herder. However, due to traditional rites that prevented rulers from participating in business, Aliyu relinquished some of his trading interest when he became the Magaji.Shehu Shagari, Beckoned To Serve: An Autobiography. Aliyu died five years after Shehu's birth, and Shehu's elder brother, Bello, briefly took on his father's mantle as Magajin Shagari. Shagari started his education in a Quranic school and then went to live with relatives at a nearby town, where from 1931-1935 he attended Yabo elementary school. In 1936‚Äì1940, he went to Sokoto for middle school, and then from 1941-1944 he attended Barewa College. Between 1944 and 1952, Shagari matriculated at the Teachers Training College, in Zaria, Kaduna, Nigeria. From 1953‚Äì1958, Shagari got a job as a visiting teacher at Sokoto Province. He was also a member of the Federal Scholarship Board from 1954‚Äì1958. Political career Shehu Usman Shagari entered politics in 1951 when he became the secretary of the Northern People's Congress in Sokoto, Nigeria, a position he held until 1956. However, his early political activities started in 1945 when as a teacher, he founded a youth group called Youth Social Circle in Sokoto and became the secretary. The organization became one of the smaller groups that came together to be part of Northern People's Congress (NPC) 2hich was founded in 1948. In 1948, when Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe of the NCNC was touring Nigeria to raise funds to send a delegation to London to ask the colonial office to abrogate Richard's constitution as undemocratic, Shehu Shagari who was a keen reader of the West-African Pilot paper was the only man of Sokoto origin to attend this meeting. When the British Provincial Educational Officer was informed of Shagari's attendance, his salary increment was postponed that year to serve as a punishment. The West-African Pilot was banned in the northern region schools and Shagari wrote for it an article for its revival in 1948. At the same time, Shagari had started advocating for the departure of colonial rule that he had produced a Hausa pamphlet carrying poetry which he named \\"Anti Colonialist\\" and put it in circulation. In 1950, Shagari, a young teacher at 25, was nominated by a British District officer H.A.S Johnson to participate in the Ibadan Conference to debate the Richards Constitution. First Republic In 1954, Shehu Shagari was elected into his first public office as a member of the federal House of Representative for Sokoto west. In 1958, Shagari was appointed as parliamentary secretary (he left the post in 1959) to the Nigerian Prime Minister, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa and that year he also served as the Federal Minister for Commerce and Industries. From 1959 to 1960, Shagari was the pioneer Federal Minister for Economic Development of independent Nigeria where his Ministry was responsible for drawing the 1962-1968 development plan. Shagari's Ministry of Economic Development was also responsible for the establishment of the Niger-Delta Development Board. From 1960 to 1962, he the Federal Minister for Pensions which undertook the mission of Nigerianization of the civil service. From 1962‚Äì1965, Shagari was made the Federal Minister for Internal Affairs. From 1965 up until the first military coup in January 1966, Shagari was the Federal Minister for Works and had executed many important projects including Eko Bridge Lagos which was the first major contract of the German construction firm Julius Berger in Nigeria, and the completion of the Niger Bridge which was commissioned in 1966 by Prime Minister, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa. In 1967 he was appointed as the secretary for Sokoto Province Education Development Fund. From 1968‚Äì1969, Shagari was given a state position in the North-Western State as Commissioner for Establishments. =Foreign missions in the First Republic= As a Member of the Parliament and a Minister, Shagari has led and was part of many Nigerian missions abroad. As Minister of Economic Development, he was a member of the Nigerian delegation to the Tangiers Conference of the U.N Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) which was led by Minister of Finance Chief Festus Okotie Eboh. In 1961, he led the delegation to the tenth anniversary of Libya's Independence. The same year, he was at the GATT Ministerial conference in Geneva, where he raised the issue of European Economic Community‚Äôs (ECC) discrimination against African countries like Nigeria who were not then, associated with EEC. The same year, he led a delegation to the Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference (CPA) in London. He became the chairman of the next CPA Conference held in Lagos between October-November 1962. In 1962, he led the delegation to ECA meeting in Addis Ababa to the commission's third meeting, the first which Nigeria attended as a full member where he strongly urged for price stabilization arrangement for tropical products. In 1963, Shagari was Nigeria's delegate to CPA meeting in Kuala Lumpur. Then in December 1965, just when Ian Smith made the Unilateral Declaration of Independence, Shehu Shagari attended the CPA conference in Wellington, New Zealand where he criticized and made an explicit denunciation of Ian Smith's declaration. In the same meeting. Shagari also expressed concerns about Rhodesia now Zimbabwe where he criticizes the Britain colonial policies the handling of Rhodesia's situation. Shehu Shagari's speech at the CPA conference was so significant and far-reaching that he had received many commendations from other delegates. He also made headlines on New Zealand's Christchurch Star of December 4, 1965, and The Morning Post of Wellington. He also led a delegation to the first session of the Economic Social Commission of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). Shagari also represented the Prime Minister on different occasions including when President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt invited the Nigerian Prime Minister Abubakar to inspect Egypt's security arrangements. He also represented the Prime Minister at Winston Churchill's funeral. Return to Sokoto After the 1966 Nigerian coup d'√©tat, Shagari was among the government officials who handed over government to the military leadership of Maj. Gen. Aguiyi Ironsi. He returned to Sokoto to promote education. He served as the Executive Secretary of the Sokoto Province Education Development Fund in 1967, where he built many provincial schools. He was later appointed as Commissioner of Establishment and Training and also served briefly as Commissioner for Education in the defunct NorthWestern States before he was invited to serve under the Federal Military Government of Gen. Yakubu Gowon. After serving under Gen. Yakubu Gowon, he returned to Sokoto again to serve as the Chairman of Sokoto State Urban Development Authority (SUDA) during which he started building Sokoto Modern Market. In the wake of local government reforms under the Obasanjo led government. Shagari was elected as the counselor of Yabo Local Government in 1976. Afterward, he served in the 1977-1978 constituent assembly which drafted the 1979 constitution. Under Gowon Following the Nigerian Civil War, from 1970 to 1971, Shagari was appointed by the military head of state General Yakubu Gowon as the federal commissioner for economic development, rehabilitation, and reconstruction which worked to carry out reconciliation policy of Gowon's Government. Shagari began reconstruction and rehabilitation of schools, hospitals, and other infrastructure in the South East. He also undertook the mission of persuading South Easterners to rejoin the civil service while negotiating the release of Biafran political prisoners after a letter written to him by Pius Okigbo was smuggled for him from Enugu Prisons. From 1971 to 1975 he served as the Federal Commissioner (a position now called minister) of finance. During his tenure as the commissioner of finance for Nigeria, Shagari was also a governor for the World Bank and a member of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) committee of twenty. Shagari as the Federal Minister of Finance also launched the present Nigerian currency Naira. In 1976, Shagari initiated the Nigeria Trust Fund in African Development Bank with the sum of One Hundred Million Dollars in order to assist poor African Countries to finance some of their developmental projects. As a minister under Gowon, Shagari also undertook a peace mission to mediate between Julius Nyerere of Tanzania and Idi Amin of Uganda in order to avert Uganda‚ÄìTanzania War by withdrawing their troops from the borders. Return To civilian rule In 1978, Shehu Shagari was a founding member of the National Party of Nigeria. In 1979 Shagari was chosen by the party as the presidential candidate for general election that year, which he won becoming the president and head of state of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Presidency Shagari is greeted by BGEN Archer Durham upon his arrival for a visit. Location: Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, United States Shagari won the 1979 election with the help of his campaign manager, Umaru Dikko. The campaign had the support of many prominent politicians in the North and among southern minorities. The party's motto was \\"One Nation, One Destiny\\" and was seen as the party best representing Nigeria's diversity. Shagari ran for a second four-year term in 1983 and won the general election. Seal of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria =Public works and Achievments= During the oil boom, Shagari made Housing, Industries, Transportation and Agriculture the major goals of his administration. =Housing= In housing, Shagari had the target of building 200,000 housing units, but by June 1983, only thirty thousand (32,000) units had been completed. Desite its shortcomings, it is the highest public housing project Nigeria has ever seen. =Transportation= In transportation, he launched many road networks across the country including the ones leading to the new fct Abuja. Others include Badagry- Sokoto road, Lagos-Kano, Porthacord Enugu, Kano-Bauchi, Warri-Okene, Abuja-Kaduna, Calabar-Ikom, Yola- Maiduguri,Mokwa-Bidda, Abuja-Keffi, Effurun-Patani-Kaiama, Jibia-Katsina, Kano-Kari and Potiskum-Maiduguri. Shagari also built and improved some seaports including Sapele Ports COmplex and started Federal Ocean Terminal in Porthacord. Inland ports were also built and modernized and a new river port was commissioned at Onitsha and another modern river port to serve the Ajaokuta Steel Mill. In aviation, Shagari created the Ministry of Aviation and built three airports in Minna, Bauchi and Akure. New passenger aircraft were also acquired for Nigerian Airways including eight B.737 and four airbus 310 during which Nigeria had the largest airline network in Africa. = Industrialisation = In 1980, with the oil revenue, Shagari finished building the Kaduna refinery, which started operating that year. Also with the oil revenue, Shagari started the construction of Ajaokuta Steel Mill which was near completion by 1983. It is the biggest steel project ever embarked in Africa at the time of its construction. The steelworks has been called the \\"bedrock of Nigeria‚Äôs industrialization\\". Shagari completed the Delta Steel complex in 1982. In 1983, Shagari created the Aluminum Smelter Company of Nigeria at Ikot Abasi. Three other Steel Rolling Mills where built, they inlcude the ones in osogbo, Katsina and Jos. However, Shagari reduced the share of oil royalties and rents to state of origin from 30 to 2 percent.

Shagari \\"refused to embrace\\" structural adjustment from the IMF and World Bank as the crisis progressed, and initiated an Economic Stabilization Program to help protect the country against a hard landing from prior highs of the 1970s and to steer the economy towards positive growth. The key objectives of the program were to limit import licenses, reduce government spending, and raise custom duties. However, the result of the stabilization program was minimal. =Defence= The one year term Shagari administration saw a rapid growth of the capacity of the Nigerian Armed Forces. Nigeria acquired most of its sophisticated weapons during this time until the recent upgrades and acquisitions. The military procurement under Shagari remains the highest in Nigeria‚Äôs history. They include the alpha Fighter Jets, the MIG Fighter Jets, 3 C-130H-30 Hercules transport aircraft, helicopter gunships among others.

The Federal Open University was also established during the end of Shagari's administration in 1981. It also offered scholarships for students studying abroad. =Abuja= Prior to the emergence of Shehu Shagari, Abuja city was virgin land. Shehu Shagari laid the first infrastructure of the new city, the first of which is the road from Suleja to the site of capital city. Other infrastructures include electricity, waters, and roads. Usman Dam Abuja, Nigeria The Usman Dam was built in 1980, which was mean to meet the water needs of the future city. The city was also connected to the National grid during that time.

Abuja was described as The Single Most Ambitious Urban Design Project of the 20th Century by a renowned architect Nnamdi Elleh =Foreign Affairs= Shagari's presidency maintained Nigeria's foreign policy since 1960, which was centered on Africa. Shagari himself was not new to foreign relations as he has led several Nigerian delegations to foreign missions since Independence. His presidency advocated and acted rigorously against apartheid in South African and white minority rule in Zambia and Zimbabwe. The liberation struggle was a task to be carried out by the Shagari Presidency. He has severally made his position known everywhere he was including during his State Visits to the United Kingdom and The United States where President Jimmy Carter had congratulated him on the independence of Zimbabwe. Correspondence between President Shagari and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher shows that he has put so much pressure on Britain concerning the independence of Zimbabwe to the extent of risking the relationship between both countries. Heads of State Cancun Summit 1981 In 1980, during Zimbabwe's independence celebration, President Shagari pledged $15 million at the celebration to train Zimbabweans in Zimbabwe and expatriates in Nigeria. Mugabe's government used part of the money to buy newspaper companies owned by South Africans, increasing the government's control over the media. The rest went to training students in Nigerian universities, government workers in the Administrative Staff College of Nigeria in Badagry, and soldiers in the Nigerian Defence Academy in Kaduna. Later that year Mugabe commissioned a report by the BBC on press freedom in Zimbabwe. The BBC issued its report on 26 June, recommending the privatization of the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation and its independence from political interests. Shagari also made attempts to create ties between Nigeria and African Americans during his visits to the United States.

However, after the 1980 U.S General Election which brought in President Ronald Reagan, Nigeria/US relationship got got to a low especially during the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott which Nigeria refused to be part of. President Shagari insisted on maintaining Nigeria's non-alignment policy and took part in the Russian Olympics despite lobby by the Regans Administration which sent the famous boxer Mohammed Ali to Nigeria. Shagari refused to see Mohammed Ali during his lobby tour. In Africa, Nigeria has had border disputes with Chad and Cameroun which almost led to a war situation but which Shagari cautiously avoided. Shagari's government was a great supporter of ECOWAS and allotted a plot for the building of its headquarters in Abuja. But despite Shagari's government scores in making peace with its neighbors, it exiled undocumented immigrants who were mostly Ghanaians of the in 1983. Even though popular with Nigerians, the action was widely criticized by commentators. It is known as Ghana Must Go, the Deportation of West African migrants from Nigeria =Corruption= Even though Shehu Shagari was exonerated from personally being involved in corrupt practices, the Second Republic was plagued by allegations of corruption, including allegations of electoral fraud in the 1983 election. This, coupled with a decline in world oil prices, and a deterioration in the national finances, hardship, leading to the regime becoming deeply unpopular with citizens. However, before removal from office, in his second term, Shagari has made attempts to curb corruption through the new Ministry of National Guidance under Yusuf Maitama Sule, which was solely created for that purpose. A new program was introduced called Ethical Revolution which has the famous War Against Indiscipline which was launched under Gen. Muhammadu Buhari among its Innitiatives. The Ministry only lasted for Three months before the 1983 coup. In his short lived second term, Shagari retained only 7 of the 45 ministers from the previous administration to demonstrate his commitment in fighting corruption. However, that did not convince the military junta which took over. =1983 Nigerian coup d'etat= Further information: 1983 Nigerian coup d'√©tat Shagari was overthrown by General Muhammadu Buhari in a military coup on 31 December 1983.

He was a member of the African American founded Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. Life Although on the left wing of the ANC, Xuma was seen during his leadership as too conservative by an increasingly impatient and activist youth, which he regarded in turn with suspicion. (His letters to colleagues are understood to be full of hostile references to communists.) As such, he was widely regarded as out of touch with the needs and demands of the grassroots.Smith, David James. Young Mandela. Kent: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2010, p. 52. Nevertheless, it was under his leadership, albeit after having been very cannily lobbied, and in spite of warnings from his colleagues that it would lead to his downfall, that the ANC in 1942 established its Youth League.Smith 2010, p. 53. A young Nelson Mandela was among the callow buttonholers (including Walter Sisulu, Congress Mbata and William Nkomo)Smith 2010, p. 54. who in 1944 visited his home in Sophiatown to agitate for his acceptance of the league's manifesto and draft constitution.

In 2013, Xuxa obtained Italian citizenship by descent. During Xuxa's birth, her father was told that both mother and child were at risk. He opted to save his wife, and prayed to St. Mary of Graces, promising to name his daughter after the Virgin if all went well. Although she was originally named after Saint Mary of Graces, Xuxa, the youngest member of the Meneghel family, received the nickname by which she came to be known from her brother, Bladimir. When their mother arrived home, she said to him: \\"Look at the baby that I bought to play with you.\\" To this, he replied: \\"I know, it's my Xuxa.\\" The nickname stuck, though it was not until 1988 that she officially became Maria da Gra√ßa Xuxa Meneghel.

As a teenager, he visited his mother, the favorite woman of an important politician, in a bordello owned by her, right before key political changes in Brazil.

The program came as a picture of Xuxa Park, but has become an independent program due to its great success. In attraction, Xuxa received several musical attractions like bands, DJs and singers. After its end, the program returned to be only a painting of the Xuxa Park. Inspired by Xuxa Hits, the Planeta Xuxa was created, which premiered on 5 April 1997 and immediately became a fever among those who grew up following Xuxa's career. Initially, Planeta Xuxa was shown on TV Globo's Saturday afternoons, so Xuxa presented two shows simultaneously on the same day, as Xuxa Park occupied the broadcasters' mornings. As of 19 April 1998, the program began to be presented on Sunday afternoons due to the 1998 World Cup, remaining on Sundays until its closure in 2002. Planeta Xuxa was focused on the performances of musicians and bands. The program had the format of a discoteque, had the participation of the public and received famous guests.

The show was broadcast on Monday mornings of TV Globo, marking the return of the presenter the broad daily of the station after the end of Xou da Xuxa.

After many reformulations to reverse the low audience, the program came to an end on 31 December 2004. In 2003, Xuxa was nominated again to Grammy for Xuxa S√≥ Para Baixinhos 3 and took the second trophy in the same category. On 30 June 2003, she inaugurated an amusement park with her name.

These degrees may claim to give credit for relevant life experience, but should not be confused with legitimate prior learning assessment programs. They may also claim to evaluate work history or require submission of a thesis or dissertation for evaluation to give an appearance of authenticity. Diploma mills are frequently supported by accreditation mills, set up for the purpose of providing an appearance of authenticity.Luca Lantero, Degree Mills: non-accredited and irregular higher education institutions , Information Centre on Academic Mobility and Equivalence (CIMEA), Italy. The term may also be used pejoratively to describe an accredited institution with low academic admission standards and a low job placement rate. An individual may or may not be aware that the degree they have obtained is not wholly legitimate. In either case, legal issues can arise if the qualification is used in r√©sum√©s. Terminology The term \\"diploma mill\\" originally denotes an institution providing diplomas on an intensive and profit-making basis, like a factory. More broadly, it describes any institution that offers qualifications which are not accredited nor based on proper academic assessment. While the terms \\"degree mill\\" and \\"diploma mill\\" are commonly used interchangeably, within the academic community a distinction is sometimes drawn.\\"The Real and the Fake: Degree and Diploma Mills\\", Alan Contreras and George Gollin, Change, March‚ÄìApril 2009 A \\"degree mill\\" issues diplomas from unaccredited institutions which may be legal in some states but are generally illegitimate, while a \\"diploma mill\\" issues counterfeit diplomas bearing the names of real universities. Academic diplomas may be legitimately awarded without any study as a recognition of authority or experience. When given extraordinarily, such degrees are called honorary degrees or honoris causa degrees. Also, in some universities, holders of a lower degree (such as a bachelor's degree) may be routinely awarded honorary higher degrees (such as a master's degree) without study. The term \\"diploma mill\\" may also be used pejoratively to describe a legitimate institution with low academic admission standards and a low job placement rate, such as for-profit schools. Related practices are direct document forgery of certificates and corrupt buying of degrees from otherwise legitimate universities, although neither require a separate \\"mill\\". Characteristics Diploma mills share a number of features that differentiate them from respected institutions, although some legitimate institutions may exhibit some of the same characteristics. =Accreditation and authenticity= The most notable feature of diploma mills is that they lack accreditation by a nationally recognized accrediting agency. (Note, however, that not all unaccredited institutions of higher learning are diploma mills.) Diploma mills therefore employ various tactics in an attempt to appear more legitimate to potential students. Some diploma mills claim accreditation by an accreditation mill while referring to themselves as being \\"fully accredited\\". Accreditation mills based in the United States may model their websites after real accrediting agencies overseen by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA). Another typical ploy is for mills to claim to be internationally recognized by organizations such as UNESCO. UNESCO has no authority to recognize or accredit higher education institutions or agencies, and has published warnings against education organizations that claim UNESCO recognition or affiliation. Some diploma and degree mills have played a role in creating unrecognized accrediting bodies as well. These diploma and degree mills may further confuse matters by claiming to consider work history, professional education, and previous learning, and may even require the submission of a dissertation or thesis in order to give an added appearance of legitimacy. As diploma mills are typically licensed to do business, it is common practice within the industry to misrepresent their business license as indicating government approval of the institution. Promotional materials may use words denoting a legal status such as \\"licensed\\", \\"state authorized\\", or \\"state-approved\\" to suggest an equivalence to accreditation. Some advertise other indicators of authenticity that are not relevant to academic credentials. For example, the University of Northern Washington advertises that its degrees are \\"attested and sealed for authenticity by a government appointed notary\\". In reality notarization only certifies that the document was signed by the person named. Diploma mills are frequently named to sound confusingly similar to those of prestigious accredited academic institutions.AP (January 28, 2009). \\"5 signs your school might be a diploma mill\\". foxnews.com; News Corp. Retrieved 2010-07-01. Despite the fact that trademark law is intended to prevent this situation, diploma mills continue to employ various methods to avoid legal recourse. Several diploma mills have adopted British-sounding names, similar but not identical to the names of legitimate universities, apparently to take advantage of the United Kingdom's reputation for educational quality in other parts of the world.Melanie Newman, Degree mills bank on allure of UK names, Times Higher Education, 20 April 2007 Some examples of British-sounding names used by diploma mills are \\"Shaftesbury University\\", \\"University of Dunham\\", \\"Redding University\\", and \\"Suffield University\\". The school's website may well not have an .edu domain, or other country-specific equivalent, since registration of such names is typically restricted. However, enforcement has sometimes been less restrictive, and an .edu domain cannot be taken as verification of school quality or reputation. Some diploma mills use an .ac top-level domain name, which resembles genuine second-level academic domain names like ac.uk but is in fact the ccTLD for Ascension Island. To prevent misuse of their names in this way, some legitimate academic institutions have registered .ac domains. =Teaching= Compared to legitimate institutions, diploma mills tend to have drastically lowered academic requirements, if any at all. Depending on the institution, students may be required to purchase textbooks, take tests, and submit homework, but degrees are commonly conferred after little or no study. Instead of \\"hard sciences\\", where competence is easier to verify, the subjects offered by a diploma mill are often esoteric and may be based on a pseudoscience like astrology or naturopathy. Such subjects are only vaguely defined, making external verification of educational standards difficult. Degree mills typically offer little or no interaction with professors. Even if comments and corrections to coursework are given, they may have no bearing on the degree which is awarded. In other cases professors may serve only to write compliments to the student that can be given as references. =Facilities= Since diploma mills provide little in the way of teaching, there is usually no need for teaching facilities. The school tends to have no library, personnel, publications or research. In short, very little that is tangible can be found about the institution. If teaching is offered, the professors may themselves hold advanced degrees from the diploma mill itself or from other unaccredited institutions. They may also sport legitimate qualifications that are unrelated to the subject they teach. Doctoral theses and dissertations from the institution will not be available from University Microfilms International, a national repository, or even the institution's own library, if it has one. The address given by a diploma mill is often a postal box, mail forwarding service or suite number. There are legitimate distance learning institutions with limited facilities, however, but legitimate universities make their authority clear. For academics, publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals are important for establishing scientific credentials. However, in diploma mills, the research is either absent, fake or purely self-published without any external review. This may be unfortunately hard to spot, since fake journals also exist. Faculty pages with bios and research may even be stolen from legitimate universities. =Promotion and fees= Buyers often use the diplomas to claim academic credentials for use in securing employment. For example, a schoolteacher might buy a degree from a diploma mill in order to advance to superintendent. Degrees from a diploma mill can be obtained within a few days, weeks or months from the time of enrollment, and back-dating is possible. Academic credit may be offered for \\"life experience,\\" a point often featured heavily in the selling points of the institution. This should not be confused with legitimate programs offering recognition of prior learning, which allow students to gain academic credit based on past training, experience or independent study. This will usually require a test that the student can fail; a diploma mill will grant the degree regardless of results. Tuition and fees are charged on a per-degree basis rather than by term or by course. Diploma mills are often advertised using e-mail spam or other questionable methods. Legitimate institutions use traditional advertising and high school recruitment. Prospective students are encouraged to \\"enroll now\\" before tuition or fees are increased. They may be told that they qualify for a fellowship, scholarship or grant, or offered deals to sign up for multiple degrees at the same time. Promotional literature might contain grammatical and spelling errors, words in Latin, extravagant or pretentious language, and sample diplomas. The school's website may look amateurish or unprofessionally made. Legal considerations Degrees and diplomas issued by diploma mills have been used to obtain employment, raises, or clients. Even if issuing or receiving a diploma mill qualification is legal, passing it off as an accredited one for personal gain is a crime in many jurisdictions. In some cases the diploma mill may itself be guilty of an offense, if it knew or ought to have known that the qualifications it issues are used for fraudulent purposes. Diploma mills could also be guilty of fraud if they mislead customers into believing that the qualifications they issue are accredited or recognized, or make false claims that they will lead to career advancement, and accept money on the basis of these claims. Similar to tax havens, diploma mills frequently employ jurisdiction shopping, operating in another country or legal jurisdiction where running diploma mills is legal, standards are lax or prosecution is unlikely. Splitting the business across jurisdictions can be a way to avoid authorities. A school might operate in one jurisdiction but use a mailing address in a different jurisdiction, for example.Navarrete, Erika and Wilson, Jaryd (May 26, 2009). \\"Online Degree Scamming\\" . KOMU TV. Retrieved 2010-07-01. Author John Bear, a distance learning and diploma mills expert, has written that fake degrees are risky for buyers and consumers: : \\"It is like putting a time bomb in your r√©sum√©. It could go off at any time, with dire consequences. The people who sell fake degrees will probably never suffer at all, but the people who buy them often suffer mightily. And ‚Äì particularly if their \\"degree\\" is health-related ‚Äì their clients may be seriously harmed.\\" =Australia= In Australia, it is a criminal offence to call an institution a university, or issue university degrees, without authorisation through an act of federal or state parliaments. Under the Higher Education Support Act 2003, corporations wishing to use the term \\"university\\" require approval from the relevant government minister, the Minister for Education (). The corporate regulator Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) places strict controls on corporations wishing to use the term \\"university\\" and if the applicant does not intend to provide education services the name must not imply a connection with an existing university.\\"Guidelines for the use of the word 'university' in company names\\" . www.asic.gov.au; Australia Securities and Investments Commission. Retrieved 2010-07-01. The Corporations Regulations 2001 lists the 39 academic organisations permitted to use the title \\"university\\". The use of higher education terms (such as \\"degree\\") is protected in state legislation, e.g. Higher Education (Qld) Act 2003. =Bosnia and Herzegovina= According to the laws on higher education in Bosnia and Herzegovina the terms \\"university\\", \\"faculty\\", \\"academy\\" and \\"university of applied sciences\\" can be used only by accredited educational institutions. Accreditation is independently assessed by the Agency for Development of Higher Education and Quality Assurance and formally conferred by the Ministry of Education and Science for each canton, entity or district. Only these institutions are allowed to award academic degrees and diplomas. Illegal use of academic titles or academic degrees and \\"non-accredited diplomas\\" may lead to prosecution, conviction, fines or even imprisonment. =Canada= In Canada all universities and colleges are under the direct supervision of the provincial and territorial governments, and there are no accreditation authorities, so the problem of degree mills is relatively rare. Many of the public universities are established by provincial legislation which also confers degree granting authority upon the institution. However, private postsecondary institutions are also required to comply with applicable legislation in order to confer degrees and diplomas. For example, in Ontario the Post-secondary Education Choice and Excellence Act, 2000 regulates degree- granting authority. Any institution that wishes to offer a degree or use the term \\"university\\" must be authorized to do so under an Act of the Legislature or by the Minister of Training, Colleges and Universities.\\"Post-secondary Education Choice and Excellence Act, 2000 : S.O. 2000, CHAPTER 36 : Schedule\\". Service Ontario e-Laws. A list of recognized Canadian higher education institutions is available on the Canadian Information Centre for International Credentials website. =China= Most, but not all, universities and colleges in the People's Republic of China are public institutions. The Ministry of Education, which has legal authority to regulate college enrollment and degree awarding, publishes a yearly list of qualified higher-education institutions. Institutions not on the list cannot admit students or award degrees. Also, no institution may call itself a \\"university\\" or \\"college\\" without approval by a provincial-level education department. Any institution, public or private, which wishes to name itself after a geographic region larger than a province (e.g. \\"South China ... University\\") must go through the Ministry of Education. A new regulation forbids any new university or college from being named \\"national\\", \\"of China\\" or similar names. , China has 210 diploma mills. =Denmark= Most universities and colleges are public institutions; universities are self-governing, but financed by the state. However, some schools, like Tvind's teacher college, provide education which is only accredited outside Denmark. =Finland= All universities and colleges are public institutions; universities are state institutions or foundations, and vocational universities are municipal organs. There are no private higher educational institutions and no legal mechanism to found or accredit any. Universities are explicitly defined in the Universities Act.\\"Yliopistolaki 24.7.2009/558\\". Finlex. Retrieved 2010-09-30.(in Finnish) Other than universities proper, technical universities (known in Finland as AMK, ammattikorkeakoulu), officially called \\"Universities of Applied Sciences\\" in English, can be established with permission from the cabinet. The degrees are protected by law. The list of AMKs can be viewed from the Ministry of Education website. For purposes of professional qualification, the use of foreign degree qualifications is regulated: if the name of a degree can be confused with a Finnish degree that requires more academic credit, the confusion must be eliminated.\\"Laki ammattip√§tevyyden tunnustamisesta 30.11.2007/1093\\". Finlex. Retrieved 2010-09-30. (in Finnish) Several diploma mills have operated in Finland, and countermeasures in university admissions have become necessary. There are no laws against conferring unaccredited degrees or degrees accredited abroad, as long as a Finnish degree or equivalent is not claimed. =Germany= In Germany, it is a criminal offense to call an institution a Universit√§t (university) or Fachhochschule, or to issue academic degrees, without authorization through an act of the respective state's Ministry of Education. It is also a misdemeanor to falsely claim a degree in Germany if it is not accredited, see :de:Missbrauch von Titeln, Berufsbezeichnungen und Abzeichen. Some corporate training programs in Germany use the English term \\"corporate university\\". Such use of the term is tolerated since it is widely understood that such programs are not actual universities. Similarly, Fachhochschulen frequently use the English term \\"university of applied science\\". Neither are permitted to use the German word Universit√§t. =Greece= Institutions of higher Tertiary education ŒëŒΩœéœÑŒ±œÑŒ± ŒïŒ∫œÄŒ±ŒπŒ¥ŒµœÖœÑŒπŒ∫Œ¨ ŒôŒ¥œÅœçŒºŒ±œÑŒ± (ŒëŒïŒô) (universities and technical universities) and ŒëŒΩœéœÑŒ±œÑŒ± Œ§ŒµœáŒΩŒøŒªŒøŒ≥ŒπŒ∫Œ¨ ŒïŒ∫œÄŒ±ŒπŒ¥ŒµœÖœÑŒπŒ∫Œ¨ ŒôŒ¥œÅœçŒºŒ±œÑŒ± (ŒëŒ§ŒïŒô) (technological educational institutes / universities of applied sciences) in Greece are fully self-managed public entities and are the only institutions that can issue university diplomas. Diplomas issued by foreign educational institutions are validated and assessed by the Hellenic National Academic Recognition and Information Center (Hellenic NARIC).Hellenic National Academic Recognition and Information Center (Hellenic NARIC), page in Greek. =Hong Kong= It is illegal under Hong Kong laws chapter 320 Post Secondary Colleges Ordinance section 8 to call an organisation a \\"university\\" without approval from the Chief Executive in Council. Under Hong Kong laws chapter 200 Crimes Ordinance section 73, anyone who knowingly uses false documents with the intention of inducing somebody to accept them as genuine is liable to 14 years' imprisonment. Section 76 assigns the same penalty for anyone who makes or possesses machines that create such false documents. \\"Crimes Ordinance Chapter 200\\". Hong Kong Laws Chap 200. =India= The University Grants Commission (UGC) states, in section 22 of the University Grants Commission Act of 1956: UGC has published a warning dated July 2012 against Indian Institute of Planning and Management (IIPM) about the unrecognized status of IIPM. =Ireland= Legitimate higher education qualifications in Ireland are placed on, or formally aligned, with the National Framework of Qualifications. This framework was established by the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland in accordance with the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act (1999). It is illegal under the Universities Act (1997) for any body offering higher education services to use the term \\"university\\" without the permission of the Minister for Education and Science. It is likewise illegal under the Institutes of Technologies Acts (1992‚Äì2006) to use the term \\"institute of technology\\" or \\"regional technology college\\" without permission. =Japan= Under Article 135 of the School Education Act, all universities and post-secondary education institutes in Japan require a government-issued licence from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT). Operating such an institute without a licence from MEXT can result in a fine of ¬•100,000 for each offence committed. In addition, the National Institution for Academic Degrees and Quality Enhancement of Higher Education (NIAD-QE) has the sole authority to accredit all university and post-secondary qualifications in Japan, as per Article 104 of the School Education Act. The \\"Patent University\\" (ja:ÁâπË®±Â§ßÂ≠¶) was an example of a Japanese diploma mill which operated from 1964 until it was shut down in 1980, and which sold fraudulent doctorates for sums ranging between ¬•300,000 and ¬•5 million. In 2007, MEXT revealed that it had discovered 48 people with suspected falsified qualifications who were successfully hired to teach in 43 universities and post-secondary education institutes throughout Japan between 2004 and 2006. =Malaysia= In Malaysia, the Education Act 1996 protects the status of the terms \\"university\\", \\"university college\\" and \\"branch campus\\". Only institutions with this status may award academic degrees. The Private Higher Education Institutions act also places restrictions on the creation and operation of any private higher education institution that conducts any course of study or training programme for which a certificate, diploma or degree is awarded. Furthermore, all legitimate higher education qualifications are placed on or formally affiliated with the Malaysian Qualifications Framework under the provisions of the Malaysian Qualifications Agency Act 2007.\\"MQF At A Glance\\" . Malaysian Qualifications Authority. Limited exemptions are however granted to organizations and institutions \\"where the teaching is confined exclusively to the teaching of any religion\\" or \\"any place declared by the Minister by notification in the Gazette not to be an educational institution\\" under the Education Act 1996. =Mexico= In Mexico, Under the Education Act the official recognition of studies (RVOE) educational programs offered by private institutions may be granted by the federal education authority by state education authorities both. There are also public institutions of higher education, which are mandated to incorporate programs of these institutions according to its own rules. As of July 10, 2000, the Ministry applied for the granting of RVOE the guidelines established in the \\"Secretarial Agreement No. 279 establishing the processes and procedures related to the recognition of official validity of studies The Secretariat of Public Education (SEP) lists several institutions that are unaccredited in Mexico. In August 2010, the Secretariat said 22 federal health officials were arrested after their medical and psychology licenses turned out to be fakes from a diploma mill according to the newspaper El Universal. They included the technical director of the National Center for Blood Transfusions and the chief medical officer of the National Commission for Medical Arbitration, which rules on cases of malpractice. =Netherlands= In the Netherlands it is illegal for non-accredited, non- recognized institutes to bestow any legally protected academic title. The NVAO is the only agency allowed to accredit courses. Since the implementation of the Bologna process, Dutch universities have started to bestow the English titles MSc and PhD instead of their Dutch equivalents. These English versions of the title are not protected under Dutch law. A diploma mill may thus bestow someone with a PhD title without violating Dutch law, but the recipient will not be allowed to use the protected titles \\"doctor\\" or \\"dr.\\" Partnerships with foreign educational institutions are possible. This is called the \\"U-bocht construction\\". In this case, the curricula are neither accredited by NVAO nor recognized by the Dutch Department of Education. Graduates receive a foreign diploma issued by the educational institution which has a partnership with a Dutch educational institution. The status of such a diploma depends upon the laws and accreditation system of the country where the diploma is granted. Diplomas from accredited universities are accepted in the Netherlands since the Bologna protocol. Diploma's from non EU institutions must be screened and validated first before they are accepted for appointments requiring a validated starting level (e.g. entering a health profession). =New Zealand= The New Zealand Education Act prohibits use of the terms \\"degree\\" and \\"university\\" by institutions other than the country's eight accredited universities. In 2004 authorities announced their intention to take action against unaccredited schools using the words \\"degree\\" and \\"university,\\" including the University of Newlands, an unaccredited distance-learning provider based in the Wellington suburb of Newlands. Other unaccredited New Zealand institutions reported to be using the word \\"university\\" included the New Zealand University of Golf in Auckland, the online Tawa-Linden and Tauranga Universities of the Third Age, and the Southern University of New Zealand. Newlands owner Rochelle M. Forrester said she would consider removing the word \\"university\\" from the name of her institution in order to comply with the law.Cohen, David (August 26, 2004). \\"New Zealand Vows a Crackdown on Diploma Mills in Wake of Unusual Defamation Lawsuit\\", The Chronicle of Higher Education =Nigeria= The National University Commission (NUC) was formed in 1999 to clamp down on diploma mill activity in the country. A concentrated effort by the NUC has resulted in a significant drop in diploma mill activity in Nigeria.\\"Clipping the Wings of Degree Mills in Nigeria\\" (PDF). Peter Okebukola, The Boston College Center for International Higher Education, Boston College, Fall 2008 An International Higher Education article states, \\"Attainment of the Nigerian vision of being one of the top 20 economies by 2020 will be compromised by the injection of such poor-quality graduates into the economy. Herein lies the distaste for and the raison d'√™tre for the government's clampdown on degree mills.\\" In Nigeria, online degrees from unaccredited institutions are banned and should not be accepted by employers.\\"Degree Mills: The Impact on Students and Society\\" (PDF). Judith S. Eaton and Stamenka Uvalic-Trumbic, The Boston College Center for International Higher Education, Boston College, Fall 2008 =Norway= Accreditation of universities and other institutions of higher education (\\"Universitet\\", \\"H√∏yskole(H√∏gskole)\\"), is governed by the state institution NOKUT, Norwegian Agency for Quality Assurance in Education. There have been cases where people submitting diplomas from a \\"Diploma Mill\\" to this agency for convalidation, have been prosecuted for fraud. =Pakistan= The government-established Higher Education Commission (HEC) is responsible for all matters related to the accreditation of universities in Pakistan. All recognized universities in Pakistan are listed on the HEC website.Pakistan Higher Education Commission. However, the Axact company, based in Karachi, was the subject of a 2015 investigation by the New York Times, which found it was committing fraud in other countries, by granting fake degrees and diplomas.Declan Walsh. \\"\\"Fake Diplomas, Real Cash: Pakistani Company Axact Reaps Millions.\\" New York Times, May 18, 2015, p. 1. Online at =Philippines= Title IV (Crimes Against Public Interest), section V articles 174 and 175 of the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines criminalize the falsification of medical certificates, certificates of merit or service and the like. Article 174 imposes a penalty on anyone who produces such certificates and article 175 on anyone who knowingly procures and uses such a certificate. Despite this, news and magazine articles appear from time to time reporting businesses operating along Claro M. Recto Avenue in Manila which offer fake documents for sale. =Portugal= In Portugal according to Base Law of Educative System from 1973 Lei n.¬∫ 5/73 (Lei de Bases do Sistema Educativo) the diploma mill is impossible. To award higher studies degrees, all higher studies institutions require a governmental issued licence provided by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Higher Education and published in the Government Journal (Di√°rio da Rep√∫blica) and communicate to the High Studies General Board (Dire√ß√£o Geral do Ensino Superior - DGES) all record of grades and degree awarded by students. Acting otherwise is punishable by law. Previously to 2007, in the process of opening a new institution or new curriculum to be lectured, it was required to provide the degree content by science branch and the list of PhD, MSc and BSc professors that lecture that specific course, thus getting a licence without expiration date, mandatory professors or contents revision date. This created a series of controversial scandals and severe lack quality in some private and public institutions as evidentiated by the 2007 state run inspection at the hands of A3ES,\\"Governo desencadeia saneamento das privadas\\" . Pedro Sousa Tavares. May 26, 2007, Di√°rio de Not√≠cias (in Portuguese) resulting in their compulsory closure and transfer of students to other institutions. Created by governmental rule to ensure the quality in higher studies along the Bologna Process implementation, this entity has a specific and rigorous agenda to control all public and private institutions of higher studies and its content. Its job is to perform inspections every 1, 2, 3 or 5 years about the academic crew scientific quality, current and new curriculum in all degrees, assure that these are up to date, and control the BSc, MSc and PhD available degrees in Portugal, by closure or approval of new courses as the Bologna Process demands. =Romania= The Romanian newspaper G√¢ndul has reported that the Dimitrie Cantemir Christian University from Bucharest started 34 Master's degree curricula which have no legal ground.\\"Universitatea Crestina \\"Dimitrie Cantemir\\" adopta modelul \\"Spiru Haret\\" \\" G√¢ndul, July 20, 2009.

(in Romanian) According to the rector of the university, Corina Dumitrescu, the law has a loophole, since it uses a continuous present for institutional evaluation, which is uncharacteristic of the Romanian language. She says that in her opinion institutional evaluation (required by law) may also happen after the curricula have been taught. The actual wording in Romanian is \\"universitate acreditatƒÉ supusƒÉ periodic evaluƒÉrii institu»õionale\\", and Dumitrescu argues that \\"care se supun\\" means that an accredited institution can be evaluated \\"today, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow\\" (and presumably, any time), not that it needs to have been evaluated in the past. For the study year 2010-2011, 16 Master's curricula from nine of its faculties are listed as accredited in Order no. 4630/2010 of the Department of Education. =Russia= Apart from the graduate level diploma mills, in Russia a significant number of leading institutions have \\"degree mills\\" within their departments (typically humanities and economics). According to the civic initiative Dissernet such institutions are providing the Russian elite (heads of universities, members of parliament and government officials) with degrees based on plagiarised and falsified Kandidat nauk (Ph.D Candidate) and Doktor nauk (full Ph.D) theses. =South Korea= It is illegal to falsely claim a degree in South Korea if it is not accredited. In March 2006 prosecutors in Seoul were reported to have broken up a crime ring selling bogus music diplomas from Russia, which helped many land university jobs and seats in orchestras. People who falsely used these degrees were criminally charged. In early 2007, Shin Jeong-ah (Ïã†Ï†ïÏïÑ) was criminally charged for forging and misusing a degree from Yale University. The case had a far-reaching impact as she was a professor at Dongguk University and also held a position at an art gallery known to have ties with economical and political figures. =Sri Lanka= Until 1999 only state universities could grant degrees, but amendments to the Universities Act now allow private institutions to be granted degree-awarding status by the University Grants Commission. Universities can also be established by an act of parliament. =Sweden= In June 2007, the Swedish Minister for Employment, Sven-Otto Littorin, was discovered to have an MBA degree from Fairfax University. Though aware that claiming an MBA from this diploma mill would be illegal in many states in the US, Littorin tried to convince the Swedish media and people of the legitimacy of his qualification. He was eventually forced to remove the reference from his official CV, but he remained in office.See article in Swedish wikipedia, \\"entry in Swedish blog Friktion\\" , and article \\"Minister's MBA 'came from degree mill' \\" , by James Savage, The Local, June 19, 2007. =Switzerland= Qualifications, diplomas and titles earned from Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology (ETH Zurich, EPFL), from cantonal (state-run) universities, from private universities recognized by state authorities, and from Fachhochschule- institutions (Universities of Applied Sciences run or recognized by official authorities, federal and cantonal) are protected. Accreditation is conferred by the Conference of University Rectors of Switzerland (CRUS) and the Swiss Center of Accreditation and Quality Assurance in Higher Education (OAQ). Under Swiss law, it is a criminal offense, under unfair competition legislation, to profit by any unfounded academic or occupational qualifications. The private use of such a title, however, is legal. Thus, one can call oneself an LL.M., but one must not use the title when competing for clients. =United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom, degrees may only be awarded by institutions that have degree-awarding powers recognised by the UK authorities (the UK parliament, the Scottish parliament, the National Assembly for Wales or the Northern Ireland Assembly). Some institutions do not have degree-awarding powers but provide complete courses leading to recognised UK degrees that are validated by institutions which have degree-awarding powers. The UK authorities recognise those institutions which have been granted degree- awarding powers by either a Royal charter, an Act of Parliament or the Privy Council. These degree-awarding institutions are known as \\"recognised bodies.\\" All UK universities and some higher education colleges are \\"recognised bodies.\\" If an institution is not a \\"recognised body\\" or makes degree awards not validated by such a body, it is likely to be a degree mill. It is an offence against section 214 of the Education Reform Act 1988 for any organisation to offer a degree qualification which could be taken to be that of a UK institution unless it is a \\"recognised body.\\" The UK Border Agency maintains a list of institutions licensed to sponsor migrant students so that overseas students can check that they are attending an appropriate institution, and the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) maintain a directory of higher education providers regulated in England. Higher Education Degree Datacheck (HEDD) is an initiative sponsored by HEFCE which aims to prevent Higher Education fraud in the UK by maintaining a list of UK degree-awarding bodies, including name changes, mergers and antecedents since 1990, and where institutions that are claiming to be universities are known to be bogus, these are also listed. =United States= Medical diploma mills have operated, and have been blacklisted, in the United States for over 120 years. The country does not have a federal law that would unambiguously prohibit diploma mills, and the term \\"university\\" is not legally protected on a national level. The United States Department of Education lacks direct plenary authority to regulate schools and, consequently, the quality of an institution's degree. However, the Federal Trade Commission works to prevent fraudulent, deceptive and unfair business practices including those in the field of education and alerts United States' consumers about diploma mills by delineating some tell-tale signs in its official web page. Under the terms of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, the U.S. Secretary of Education is required by law to publish a list of nationally recognized accrediting agencies that the Secretary determines to be reliable authorities on the quality of education or training provided by the institutions of higher education that they accredit. Some degree mills have taken advantage of the Establishment Clause and Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment by representing themselves as seminaries, since in many jurisdictions religious institutions can legally offer degrees in religious subjects without government regulation.Associated Press, \\"Texas Supreme Court to review seminary case\\" , December 3, 2004 Although the DipScam operation in the 1980s led to a decline in diploma mill activity across the United States, the lack of further action by law enforcement, uneven state laws, and the rise of the Internet have combined to reverse many of the gains made in previous years. In 2005, the US Department of Education launched its Database of Accredited Postsecondary Institutions and Programs websiteDatabase of Accredited Postsecondary Institutions and Programs:. ope.ed.gov; U.S. Department of Education. to combat the spread of fraudulent degrees. A number of states have passed bills restricting the ability of organizations to award degrees without accreditation.\\"State mulls online learning\\" Associated Press, Billings Gazette, January 30, 2005\\"Is Oregon the only state that disallows use of unaccredited degrees?\\" Oregon Office of Degree Authorization Jurisdictions that have restricted or made illegal the use of credentials from unaccredited schools include Oregon, Michigan,\\"Colleges and Universities not accredited by CHEA\\" , Michigan Education and Children's Services.

After swimming competitively in America as a collegian at North Carolina State University, he was an Olympic swimmer for Great Britain and won Olympic gold and bronze medals at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. He also swam at the 1976 Summer Olympics. Early life Goodhew attended Windlesham House School and Millfield School (Walton House). Aged 10, he fell out of a tree, a traumatic event which triggered permanent hair loss due to alopecia universalis. Career Goodhew came to prominence as an international swimmer in 1976, finishing 7th in the 100m breaststroke at the Montreal Olympics that summer. Four years later, in the 1980 Moscow Olympics, he won gold in the 100m breaststroke, in a time of 1:03.34, and a bronze in the 4x100m medley relay. He represented England and won three silver medals in the breaststroke events and medley relay, at the 1978 Commonwealth Games in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. At the ASA National British Championships he won the 100 metres breaststroke title in 1976, 1978 and 1980 and the 200 metres breaststroke title in 1976, 1978 and 1980. His bald head made him instantly recognisable. He was a member of the British bobsleigh team at the 1981 European Championships (cf. We Are the Champions, 1984 Grand Final). He now works part-time at Millfield School. Goodhew made two guest appearances on The Sooty Show: firstly, in 1984, in the episode, \\"All Blocked Up\\" and secondly in 1991 in the episode \\"Hair Today\\". He claims he was dyslexic; he is also an author and motivational speaker. He was appointed an MBE by Queen Elizabeth II for services to sport. Goodhew's 100 m breaststroke gold medal achievement was ranked 99th in the British network Channel 4's 100 Greatest Sporting Moments in 2002. He has made a number of television appearances including Dave Gorman's Important Astrology Experiment. After the London protests during the 2008 Summer Olympics torch relay, Goodhew stated that the protests were \\"a bad example for children\\". On 29 September 2001, Goodhew participated in an international relay off the coast of California from Santa Catalina Island to Santa Monica. Of the eight international relay teams participating, each team had one swimmer with MS. Goodhew swam on the same team as organizer and MS activist Taylor MH. Proceeds from fund-raising were all donated to the Myelin Project. Cultural references He is mentioned in the BBC TV series The Office during a motivational speech by David Brent (Ricky Gervais), by The Toy Dolls in a song called Yul Brynner Was A Skinhead, in an episode of Little Britain in which a bald character is likened to the swimmer, in The Mighty Boosh when a peacock crashes into his back in a speech made by Naboo, and also in the Welsh psychedelic rock group, Sen Segur's song \\"Taith Duncan Goodhew\\" from their first EP, 'Pen Rhydd'.. He recorded a charity single with Melbourne‚Äôs very own Martin Enright which briefly featured in the top 100 record charts. He is also sardonically mentioned in the Only Fools and Horses episode \\"The Longest Night\\" by Tom Clark, the head security officer of the fictional Top Buyer Superstores. He is mentioned in the song 'Shaven Haven' by Kunt and The Gang and was also featured in The Macc Lads song \\"Al O'Peesha\\". He appears in several episodes of Dave Gorman's Important Astrology Experiment, after Dave was instructed to befriend somebody with his initials, but whose life was very different. Together, they're seen playing hide and seek, frisbee, cycling and swimming. In the BBC Radio 4 spoof news programme On The Hour, the sports desk presenter Alan Partridge often alludes to a fictional incident where Goodhew's hair 'tragically' grows back, thus robbing him of his celebrity status as a 'cheery bald swimming star'. Duncan was a guest on Radio 4 Extra's News Quiz Extra Personal life Goodhew married Annie Patterson, an American graphic designer from North Carolina, in December 1984, and they have two children.

Background and education Born in London, Salisbury was the eldest son of Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury, who served as British Prime Minister, by his wife Georgina (n√©e Alderson). The Right Reverend Lord William Cecil, Lord Cecil of Chelwood and Lord Quickswood were his younger brothers, and Prime Minister Arthur Balfour his first cousin. He was educated at Eton and University College, Oxford, graduating BA in 1885. Political career He started public life early, being of a very young age when he accompanied his father to the 1876‚Äì1877 Constantinople Conference and a year later to the Congress of Berlin. Lord Cranborne sat as Conservative Member of Parliament for Darwen, then called North-East Lancashire, from 1885 to 1892. He lost his seat at the general election of the latter year. He was elected for Rochester at a by-election in 1893, continuing as MP there until 1903, when he succeeded his father and was elevated to the House of Lords. Lord Cranborne was appointed lieutenant- colonel of the 4th (Militia) battalion Bedfordshire Regiment (formerly the Hertfordshire Militia) on 29 October 1892, and was in command when the battalion saw active service in South Africa from March to November 1900, during the Second Boer War. The battalion, numbering 24 officers and 483 men, left Queenstown on 27 February in the transport Goorkha, with Lord Cranborne as the senior officer in command, arriving in Cape Town the following month. He received the Queen's South Africa Medal and was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) for his service during the war.

He was the second President of the League of Nations, and served again as its president in 1932‚Äì33. Hymans was the son of Belgian writer and historian Louis Hymans. He became a lawyer and professor at the Universite Libre de Bruxelles. As a politician he became Belgian Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1918 to 1920 (and again from 1927 to 1935), minister of justice from 1926 to 1927, and member of the council of ministers from 1935 to 1936. In 1919, together with Charles de Broqueville and Emile Vandervelde he introduced universal suffrage for all men (one man, one vote) and compulsory education. As foreign minister during the Great war, Hymans was successful in securing promises from the Allies that amounted to co-belligerency. Britain, France and Russia pledged in the Declaration of Sainte-Adresse in February 1916 that Belgium would be included in the peace negotiations, but its independence would be restored, and that it would receive a monetary compensation for Germany for the damage. When war began, Hymans also got major promises of relief support from the United States, with the approval of President Wilson. Relief was directed primarily by an American Herbert Hoover and involved several agencies: Commission for Relief in Belgium, American Relief Administration, and Comit√© National de Secours et d'Alimentation. At the Paris peace conference in 1919, Belgium officially ended its long time neutral status, and became first in line to receive reparations payments from Germany. However, Belgium received only a small bit of German territory, and was rejected in its demands for all of Luxembourg and part of the Netherlands. However, it was given colonial mandates over the German colonies of Rwanda and Burundi. Hymans was the leading spokesman for the small countries at Paris, and became president of the first assembly of the new League of Nations. He Hymans helped form the customs union of Belgium and Luxembourg (Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union) in 1921 and played a leading part in negotiating the Dawes Plan in 1924. In 1928, he signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact for Belgium.Holger H. Herwig, and Neil M. Heyman, eds. Biographical Dictionary of World War I (Greenwood, 1982) p 192-93.

In the liturgical year of some Christian denominations, Passion Sunday is the fifth Sunday of Lent, marking the beginning of the two-week period called Passiontide. In 1969, the Roman Catholic Church removed Passiontide from the liturgical year of the Novus Ordo form of the Mass, but the day remains observed on the fifth Sunday in the Extraordinary Form mass, the formerly Anglican catholics of the Personal Ordinariates, the Anglican Communion, and by Lutherans. In Scotland the day is known as Care Sunday or Carling Sunday, a term that seems originally to have been applied to Palm Sunday. Fifth Sunday of Lent Until 1959, the fifth Sunday of Lent was officially known in the Roman Catholic Church as Passion Sunday.Dominica de Passione ‚Äì Missale Romanum, 1920 typical edition, p. 156 It marked the beginning of a two-week-long period known as Passiontide, which is still observed by some traditionalist Catholics, Western Rite Orthodoxy, various denominations in Protestantism. In 1960, Pope John XXIII's Code of Rubrics changed the name for that Sunday to \\"First Sunday of the Passion\\"Dominica I Passionis ‚Äì Missale Romanum 1962, p. 118 bringing the name into harmony with the name that Pope Pius XII gave, five years earlier, to the sixth Sunday of Lent, \\"Second Sunday of the Passion or Palm Sunday\\". Pope Paul VI's revision in 1969 removed a distinction that existed (although with overlap) between Lent and Passiontide, which began with the fifth Sunday of Lent. The distinction, explicit in the 1960 Code of Rubrics,The Code of Rubrics speaks of Lent (tempus quadragesimale) as comprising Passiontide (tempus Passionis), but at the same time distinguishes Lent in a narrower sense (tempus Quadragesimae) from Passiontide. predates it.The distinction is found repeatedly in, for instance, the pre-1960 Ritus servandus in celebratione Missae, which speaks of Passiontide as following Lent (without suggesting that Lenten observances should end at that point), but which also speaks of Lent as extending at least to Wednesday of Holy Week, as in: \\"In Quadragesima autem a Feria IV Cinerum usque ad Feriam IV Majoris Hebdomadae ...\\" (Ritus servandus in celebratione Missae, XI, 2). He removed from the fifth Sunday of Lent the reference to the Passion. Although Passiontide as a distinct liturgical season was thus abolished, the Roman Rite liturgy continues to bring the Passion of Christ to mind, from Monday of the fifth week of Lent onward, through the choice of hymns, the use on the weekdays of the fifth week of Lent of Preface I of the Passion of the Lord, with Preface II of the Passion of the Lord being used on the first three weekdays of Holy Week, and the authorization of the practice of covering crosses and images from the fifth Sunday of Lent onward, if the Conference of Bishops so decides. Where this practice is followed, crucifixes remain covered until the end of the Good Friday celebration of the Lord's Passion; statues remain covered until the beginning of the Easter Vigil. The entrance antiphon of the Mass on the fifth Sunday of Lent begins with the word \\"Iudica\\" (older spelling, \\"Judica\\"). This provides another name for that Sunday: \\"Iudica Sunday\\" or \\"Judica Sunday\\",Mershman, Francis. \\"Passion Sunday.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 6 April 2019 similar to the name \\"Laetare Sunday\\" for the fourth Sunday. Because of the custom of veiling crucifixes and statues in the church before Mass on the fifth Sunday of Lent, this Sunday was called Black Sunday in Germany, where the veils, which elsewhere were generally violet, were of black colour. Those who continue to observe earlier forms of the Roman Rite or of liturgies modelled on it refer to the fifth Sunday of Lent by one or other of its previous names. =Anglican usage= The altar cross veiled in crimson for Passiontide at St. Mary's Episcopal Cathedral in Memphis, Tennessee In those Anglican churches which follow the Sarum Use, crimson vestments and hangings are pressed into service on the fifth Sunday of Lent ‚Äì replacing the Lenten array (unbleached muslin cloth) ‚Äì and vestments are crimson until (and including) Holy Saturday. Reflecting the recent shift away from the observance of Passiontide as a distinct season, the Church of England's Common Worship liturgical resources suggest red for Holy Week only (with the exception of the Maundy Thursday Eucharist). =Lutheran readings= The historical readings for the fifth Sunday of Lent in the Lutheran tradition are Genesis 12:1‚Äì3, Hebrews 9:11‚Äì15, John 8:46‚Äì59, and Psalm 43. I Corinthians 1:21‚Äì31 and Matthew 26:17‚Äì29 are alternate readings.Evangelical Lutheran Hymnary.

The Collect for Passion Sunday read as follows: The lectionary of the same liturgical text appointed the Old Testament reading as being Gen. 22:1‚Äì2, 9‚Äì13; the Epistle as being Heb. 9:11‚Äì14; the Gospel as being John 11:47‚Äì53. Sixth Sunday of Lent In the Roman Rite the name \\"Passion Sunday\\" has never been officially applied to the sixth Sunday of Lent in spite of the reading at the Mass of that day of an account in one of the Synoptic Gospels of the Passion of Christ. Until 1969, the account read was always that of the Gospel of Matthew: the whole of chapters 26 and 27 ()Missale Romanum, 1920 typical edition, pp. 179‚Äì185 until 1954, but reduced in 1955 to and for priests celebrating a second or a third Mass on that day to alone.Missale Romanum 1962, pp. 137‚Äì140 Since 1970, the revision of the Roman Missal has introduced a three-year cycle in which the accounts of Matthew ( or ), Mark ( or ) and Luke ( or are read in successive years.Readings for the Sundays of Lent Until 1954, the name of the sixth Sunday of Lent was \\"Palm Sunday\\".Dominica in Palmis ‚Äì Missale Romanum, 1920 typical edition, p. 171 In 1955, the name became, for 15 years only, \\"Second Sunday of the Passion or Palm Sunday\\".Dominica II Passionis seu in palmis ‚Äì Missale Romanum 1962, p. 130 In 1970, it became \\"Palm Sunday of the Passion of the Lord\\".Dominica in Palmis de Passione Domini ‚Äì current edition of the Roman Missal The sixth Sunday of Lent has thus never officially been given the exact name \\"Passion Sunday\\" and the term \\"Palm Sunday\\" is given first place in its present official name.

Early years Hynes was born on September 22, 1897, the son of Bernard Hynes of Abbey Street, Loughrea, County Galway, Ireland, who emigrated to Boston about 1890. Bernard Hynes was a member of the Hynes family of Kylegarriff, Killeenadeema, Loughrea. Career Hynes began his career at city hall in 1920 as a clerk in the health department. He later transferred to the auditing department and was chief clerk in the Mayor's office during James Michael Curley's 1922 to 1926 term. On January 4, 1926, Hynes became the city's assistant budget commissioner. He earned his high school and college diplomas through evening classes, graduating from Suffolk University Law School in 1927. On June 18, 1929 he was appointed assistant city clerk. In August 1943, Hynes was commissioned a Major in the United States Army. He was discharged that December due to a reoccurrence of a chronic ear issue and returned to the city clerk's office. On September 1, 1945 he became Boston's city clerk. On June 26, 1947, Mayor James Michael Curley was sentenced to six to eighteen months in prison for mail fraud. The city charter allowed the president of the city council to serve as acting mayor in the mayor's absence, but his powers were limited unless the mayor was deceased. The Massachusetts General Court passed emergency legislation to bypass council president John B. Kelly, who had recently been acquitted on bribery charges and was in ill health, and to grant full Mayoral powers to Hynes (who as city clerk was second in the line of succession) until Curley's release from prison. Curley, upon his return from prison, commented to the press, \\"I have accomplished more in one day than has been done in the five months of my absence.\\" Stung by this off-hand but disparaging comment about his performance as acting mayor, Hynes decided to challenge Curley in the November 1949 election, and defeated him. Because of a change to the mayoral election system, the next election was held in November 1951, when Hynes again defeated Curley. Hynes faced Curley a third time in the 1955 mayoral race; Curley was eliminated in the preliminary election, and Hynes defeated John E. Powers in the general election. Overall, Hynes served as mayor from January 2, 1950, until January 4, 1960. Hynes died on January 6, 1970, at Carney Hospital in Dorchester, Boston. Legacy During his tenure as mayor, he oversaw the opening of the Central Artery elevated highway through the city's waterfront district, as well as the opening of the Freedom Trail, which traces many of Boston's Revolutionary War era landmarks. He was responsible for founding the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA), which laid the foundation for developments in Boston in the 1950s and beyond including the controversial razing of the West End. Hynes and his successors, John Collins and Kevin White, are most responsible for the modernization of the city of Boston. The Hynes Convention Center, located in the Back Bay section of Boston, is named for him. One son, Jack Hynes, was a longtime Boston news anchor. Another son, Richard Hynes, taught at Boston University. A third son, Barry T. Hynes, served on the Boston City Council and was Boston's city clerk.

Background Nicknamed \\"Bobbety\\", Salisbury was the eldest son of James Gascoyne-Cecil, 4th Marquess of Salisbury, by his wife Lady Cicely Gore, daughter of the 5th Earl of Arran, and the grandson of the 3rd Marquess of Salisbury, Prime Minister 1895‚Äì1902. He was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, receiving an honorary Doctorate of Civil Laws in 1951. Military career He served in the Army during the First World War. He was commissioned as a lieutenant into the Grenadier Guards (SR) from 1915 throughout the war until its end. He was awarded the Croix de Guerre and Chevalier Order of the Crown of Belgium. When the war ended, he went to work at Westminster Bank. In 1928, he was appointed a director and to the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts; he was promoted to chairman of the commission in 1957. Political career Salisbury, as Viscount Cranborne, was elected as a Conservative to the House of Commons as MP for South Dorset in 1929. As Parliamentary Secretary to the Lord Privy Seal in 1934 in Ramsay MacDonald's National Government, he was promoted serving as Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs from 1935 to 1938. He was made Paymaster-General by Winston Churchill in May 1940 for the duration of the Battle of Britain but was appointed Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs from 1940 to 1942. In 1941, he was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in one of his father's titles as Baron Cecil of Essendon. He was Secretary of State for the Colonies in February‚ÄìNovember 1942, Lord Privy Seal between 1942 and 1943, Leader of the House of Lords between 1942 and 1945 and again Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs between 1943 and 1945. As a friend of Churchill, in 1943, he was appointed President of the English-Speaking Union to promote the universality of the language throughout the British Empire. His final wartime appointment was as President of the University College of the South West for a statutory ten years before it was converted to university status. In 1947, King George VI made Salisbury a Knight of the Order of the Garter, and he succeeded his father in the marquessate shortly afterwards. He became High Steward of Hertfordshire, where he lived, in 1947, shortly before the office was abolished. During the 1950s, when his party returned to office, successively, he served Churchill, Anthony Eden, and Harold Macmillan as Lord Privy Seal from 1951 to 1952; Leader of the House of Lords from 1951 to 1957; Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations in 1952 and Lord President of the Council from December 1952 to 1957. During the period of the coronation of Elizabeth II, he was appointed Acting Foreign Secretary, as Eden was then seriously ill after a series of botched operations on his bile duct. In November 1951, he received an honorary doctorate of law from the University of Liverpool.Other academic honorary awards: Doctor of Law: Toronto University, 1949; Birmingham University, 1950; Cambridge, 1954; Manchester University, 1954; London, 1955. He received as well an honorary Doctorate of Literature, Exeter University, 1956; Hon LLD St Andrews, 1953. Lord Salisbury was known as a hardline imperialist. In 1952, as Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, he tried to make permanent the exile of Seretse Khama, kgosi (leader) of the Bamangwato people in Bechuanaland, for marrying a white British woman. During the 1960s, Lord Salisbury continued to be a staunch defender of the white- dominated governments in South Africa and in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and was granted the Freedom of the City of Salisbury on a visit in 1956. He was also a fierce opponent of liberal-left attempts to reform the House of Lords, but he created what is known as the Salisbury Convention, under which the House of Lords will not oppose the second or third reading of any government legislation promised in its election manifesto. In January 1957, Eden resigned as prime minister. The two candidates were Rab Butler and Harold Macmillan. The Queen took advice from Winston Churchill (who backed Macmillan), Edward Heath (who, as Chief Whip, was aware of backbench opinion), and Salisbury, who interviewed the Cabinet one by one and with his famous speech impediment, asked each one whether he was for \\"Wab or Hawold\\" (it is thought that only between one and three were for \\"Wab\\"). To the surprise of the media, the advice was overwhelmingly to appoint Macmillan as Prime Minister instead of Butler. Lord Salisbury resigned from his position as Leader of the House of Lords in opposition to the Government's decision to release Archbishop Makarios from his detention in Seychelles. Makarios, the Archbishop of Cyprus, had been arrested because the British perceived that he was encouraging inter-communal violence and terrorism in Cyprus during the so- called 'Cyprus Question'. He became the first president of the Conservative Monday Club in January 1962, when he stated \\"there was never a greater need for true conservatism than there is today\\".Copping, 1972, p. 5. He held the post until his death in 1972. Salisbury's cultural pursuits were recognised when he was made a Fellow of the Royal Academy that year.Burke's Peerage & Baronetage (106th ed.) (Salisbury) These artistic credentials were enhanced as a Trustee of the National Gallery from 1960 to 1966. Apart from his political career, Salisbury was Chancellor of the University of Liverpool from 1951 until 1971. In 1970, students at the university staged an occupation at Senate House to demand his removal over his support for apartheid and other reactionary views. Marriage and children Lord Salisbury married Elizabeth Vere Cavendish, daughter of Lord Richard Cavendish and his wife Lady Moyra de Vere Beauclerk (a daughter of The 10th Duke of St Albans), on 8 December 1915. They had three sons, two of whom predeceased their parents: * Robert Edward Peter Gascoyne-Cecil, 6th Marquess of Salisbury (born 24 October 1916, died 11 July 2003) * Michael Charles James Gascoyne-Cecil (born 27 October 1918, died 27 October 1934) * Richard Hugh Vere Gascoyne-Cecil (born 31 January 1924, killed in action 12 August 1944), a Sergeant Pilot in the RAF who died in the Second World War. Lord Salisbury died in February 1972, at 78, and was succeeded by his eldest and only surviving son, Robert, who became the 6th Marquess. Lady Salisbury died on 5 June 1982.Burke's, ibid.

He served as the second President of Cyprus from 1977 to 1988. Spyrou Kyprianou Avenue () in Nicosia was named after him posthumously. Early life and education Kyprianou was born in Limassol in 1932. He studied Economics and Commerce at the City of London College and law at GrayŒÑs Inn. He also studied comparative law, receiving a diploma. Political career During the time he spent in London as a student, Kyprianou founded the National Union of Cypriot Students in England (E.F.E.K.A.) of which he was the first President. In 1952 he was appointed Secretary of Archbishop Makarios in London and in 1954 he assumed responsibility for the Office of the Secretary of the Cyprus Ethnarchy in London, the major objective of which was to inform British public opinion on the Cyprus issue. This effort was intensified after the start of the liberation struggle in Cyprus in 1955. Due to this activity, he was forced to leave the UK in June 1956 and went to Greece. There, he collaborated with the Panhellenic Committee for Self-Determination for Cyprus which aimed to raise the profile of the Cyprus case on the international scene. From August 1956 to March 1957, Kyprianou represented the Cyprus Ethnarchy in New York. Later, he was allowed to return to his London post as representative of the Cyprus Ethnarchy. He stayed in London until the signing of the London ‚Äì Zurich Agreements for the independence of Cyprus and returned to Cyprus with Archbishop Makarios in March 1959. During the transitional period after the signing of the agreements on Cyprus, Kyprianou represented the Greek Cypriot side at the Athens Conference for the drafting of the Agreement on the Application of the Tripartite Alliance (Cyprus ‚Äì Greece ‚Äì Turkey), this was provided for in the London ‚Äì Zurich Agreements. After the declaration of the independence of Cyprus in August 1960, the President of the Republic of Cyprus Archbishop Makarios appointed Kyprianou Minister of Justice and, a few days later, Minister of Foreign Affairs. As Minister of Foreign Affairs, he repeatedly represented Cyprus at the UN Security Council, and in sessions of the U.N. General Assembly during debates on the Cyprus issue. He also participated in meetings of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, of which he served as Chairman from April to December 1967. In addition, he visited countries and represented Cyprus in negotiations with foreign governments. In September 1964, in Moscow, he signed the Agreement for Soviet Military Aid to Cyprus. He resigned from his post as Minister of Foreign Affairs on 5 May 1972, after a dispute with the military regime in Athens. After this resignation, he worked as a lawyer and a legal counsellor. On 1 August 1974, following the coup of the Greek junta and the Turkish invasion in Cyprus, Kyprianou went to Athens where he had talks with the Government of National Unity, which took over following the collapse of the junta. He travelled between Athens and London where President Makarios was staying temporarily. In September 1974, he headed the Cyprus delegation to the General Assembly of the United Nations during the debate on Cyprus. In February 1975, he attended the Security Council meeting in New York as member of the Cyprus delegation. On 12 May 1976, he announced the establishment of the Democratic Party. In the parliamentary elections of 5 September 1976, the Democratic Party won 21 seats out of a total of 35 in the House of Representatives, and Kyprianou was elected President of the House. After the death of the President of the Republic Archbishop Makarios on 3 August 1977, Kyprianou became Acting President of the Republic, in accordance with the constitution. On 3 September 1977, he was unanimously elected President of the Republic to serve the remaining term of office of Archbishop Makarios. Kyprianou's eldest son Achilles was kidnapped by members of EOKA on the evening of 14 December 1977. Achilles was later released on 18 December. In the presidential elections of 28 February 1978, and 13 February 1983, he was reelected as President of the Republic, the first time being elected unopposed. He was defeated by George Vasiliou at the elections in 1988. As President of the Republic of Cyprus, he visited many countries and participated in sessions of the United Nations, as well as summit conferences of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Commonwealth of Nations. Kyprianou was awarded medals of honour, distinctions and decorations by various countries. In 1985, the University of Belgrade awarded him an honorary doctorate. Following the parliamentary elections of 26 May 1996, Kyprianou was elected President of the House of Representatives. He stepped down in 2001, ending a 30-year career in politics. Family Kyprianou married Mimi Pagathrokliton in 1956 and had two sons, Achilleas and Markos. His second son, Markos Kyprianou, served as a European Commissioner from 2004 to 2008 and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Cyprus. Death Spyros Kyprianou died on 12 March 2002 after a long fight with cancer. He was survived by his wife, Mimi Pagathrokliton, and their two sons.

Following the trial, on June 10, 1971, Davis called a General Assembly of delegates of the World Government of World Citizens at Novetal, Sausheim, H.R. to declare the founding of the World Court of Human Rights, based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, articles 6 to 11. He appointed Luis Kutner as \\"Chief Justice.\\" (See Kutner's acceptance speech below). Kutner's Commission subsequently wrote the Statute for the Court for Due Process of International Law. A test of the new court's efficacy was demonstrated in the case of Dennis Cecil Hills, the British Author, residing in Uganda during Idi Amin's presidency, who was scheduled to die by firing squad on June 26, 1975, for having written of the president as a \\"village tyrant\\" and therefore subsequently condemned as an \\"enemy of the state.\\" On Friday, June 23, Davis from Strasbourg, France sent the following telegram to Chief Justice Kutner in Chicago: \\"IN THE NAME OF THE COORDINATING COMMITTEE OF WORLD GOVERNMENT, I HEREBY REQUEST WORLD COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS AGAINST IDI AMIN ON BEHALF OF CECIL HILL STOP.\\" Chief Justice Kutner forwarded the following cable to His Excellency Idi Amin at Kampala, Uganda: > At the request of World Government of world citizens in Basel, Switzerland, > and the commission for international due process of law and the world court > of human rights, I am invoking your excellency to accept the herein > telegraphed writ of world habeas corpus in behalf of your detainee Cecil > Hill, consistent with Uganda's sovereign status as a member of the United > Nations voluntarily assuming the human rights obligations of the charter, > universal declaration of human rights, and other protocols and conventions > guaranteeing the sanctity and integrity of human beings in global society of > civilized nations dedicated to human dignity and standards of due process of > law, respectfully, Luis Kutner > world chairman > commission international > due process of law > world court of human rights Capitalization added for readability. Mr. Sam Msubuga, legal advisor of the Charg√© d'Affaires of the Uganda Embassy in Washington informed Kutner on Monday, June 26, of the reception of the telegraphed writ, was willing to comply and wished to \\"negotiate\\" Dennis Hill's release. Kutner informed the legal advisor the matter was strictly judicial not diplomatic and that, \\"If the defendant was not released forthwith, this Court will issue a Show Cause Order to which the President will have thirty days to reply.\\" At 5 p.m., Uganda time, Cecil Hill was released from detention. On July 27, 2011, The World Court of Human Rights was declared de juris by World Citizen Garry Davis from the War Memorial Opera House from where the United Nations was declared over 66 years prior. Dr. Luis Kutner's acceptance speech as the Chief Justice of the World Court of Human Rights: > I am indeed honored by this appointment which I accept in all humility.

The most apparent character of the area is the development of tidal channels, affecting mainly the intertidal zone. In this case, the tidal flat is protected seaward by a beach barrier, but in many cases (low-energy waves and longshore currents) the tidal flats may directly pass into a shallow marine environment. Mudflats or mud flats, also known as tidal flats, are coastal wetlands that form in intertidal areas where sediments have been deposited by tides or rivers. A recent global analysis suggested they are as extensive globally as mangroves. / They are found in sheltered areas such as bays, bayous, lagoons, and estuaries; they are also seen in freshwater lakes and salty lakes (or inland seas) alike, wherein many rivers and creeks end.Swamps and marshes (with thick and deep mud beneath surfaces in hot season) are either freshwater, salty, or brackish. Mudflats may be viewed geologically as exposed layers of bay mud, resulting from deposition of estuarine silts, clays and aquatic animal detritus. Most of the sediment within a mudflat is within the intertidal zone, and thus the flat is submerged and exposed approximately twice daily. In the past tidal flats were considered unhealthy, economically unimportant areas and were often dredged and developed into agricultural land.Dredging Indian River Lagoon Wetlands 1920 - 1950s Several especially shallow mudflat areas, such as the Wadden Sea, are now popular among those practising the sport of mudflat hiking. On the Baltic Sea coast of Germany in places, mudflats are exposed not by tidal action, but by wind-action driving water away from the shallows into the sea. These wind-affected mudflats are called windwatts in German. Ecology Oban on Stewart Island, New Zealand Tidal flats, along with intertidal salt marshes and mangrove forests, are important ecosystems.Tidal flat habitats They usually support a large population of wildlife, and are a key habitat that allows tens of millions of migratory shorebirds to migrate from breeding sites in the northern hemisphere to non-breeding areas in the southern hemisphere. They are often of vital importance to migratory birds, as well as certain species of crabs,Tri√±o, A. T., & Rodriguez, E. M. (2000). Mud crab (Scylla serrata) culture in tidal flats with existing mangroves. In J. H. Primavera, M. T. Casta√±os, & M. B. Surtida (Eds.), Mangrove-Friendly Aquaculture: Proceedings of the Workshop on Mangrove-Friendly Aquaculture organized by the SEAFDEC Aquaculture Department, January 11-15, 1999, Iloilo City, Philippines (pp. 171‚Äì176). Aquaculture Department, Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center. https://repository.seafdec.org.ph/handle/10862/454 mollusks and fish.Manko - Tidal Flat, Mangrove Forest In the United Kingdom mudflats have been classified as a Biodiversity Action Plan priority habitat. The maintenance of mudflats is important in preventing coastal erosion. However, mudflats worldwide are under threat from predicted sea level rises, land claims for development, dredging due to shipping purposes, and chemical pollution. In some parts of the world, such as East and South-East Asia, mudflats have been reclaimed for aquaculture, agriculture, and industrial development. For example, around the Yellow Sea region of East Asia, more than 65% of mudflats present in the early 1950s had been destroyed by the late 2000s. / It is estimated that up to 16% of the world tidal flats have disappeared since the mid-1980s. Mudflat sediment deposits are focused into the intertidal zone which is composed of a barren zone and marshes. Within these areas are various ratios of sand and mud that make up the sedimentary layers.Reineck, H.E, and I.B Singh, Depositional Sedimentary Environments, 2nd Ed. New York: Springer- Verlag Berlin Heidelberg, 1980, pp. 418-428 The associated growth of coastal sediment deposits can be attributed to rates of subsidence along with rates of deposition (example: silt transported via river) and changes in sea level. Barren zones extend from the lowest portion of the intertidal zone to the marsh areas. Beginning in close proximity to the tidal bars, sand dominated layers are prominent and become increasingly muddy throughout the tidal channels. Common bedding types include laminated sand, ripple bedding, and bay mud. Bioturbation also has a strong presence in barren zones. Marshes contain an abundance of herbaceous plants while the sediment layers consist of thin sand and mud layers. Mudcracks are a common as well as wavy bedding planes. Marshes are also the origins of coal/peat layers because of the abundant decaying plant life. Salt pans can be distinguished in that they contain thinly laminated layers of clayey silt. The main source of the silt comes from rivers. Dried up mud along with wind erosion forms silt dunes. When flooding, rain or tides come in, the dried sediment is then re-distributed.

His best-known work includes writing and editing the parodic comic book Mad from 1952 until 1956, and illustrating the Little Annie Fanny strips in Playboy from 1962 until 1988. His work is noted for its satire and parody of popular culture, social critique, and attention to detail. Kurtzman's working method has been likened to that of an auteur, and he expected those who illustrated his stories to follow his layouts strictly. Kurtzman began to work on the New Trend line of comic books at EC Comics in 1950. He wrote and edited the Two-Fisted Tales and Frontline Combat war comic books, where he also drew many of the carefully researched stories, before he created his most-remembered comic book, Mad, in 1952. Kurtzman scripted the stories and had them drawn by top EC cartoonists, most frequently Will Elder, Wally Wood, and Jack Davis; the early Mad was noted for its social critique and parodies of pop culture. The comic book switched to a magazine format in 1955, and Kurtzman left it in 1956 over a dispute with EC's owner William Gaines over financial control. Following his departure, he did a variety of cartooning work, including editing the short-lived Trump and the self- published Humbug. In 1959, he produced the first book-length work of original comics, the adult-oriented, satirical Jungle Book. He edited the low-budget Help! from 1960 to 1965, a humor magazine which featured work by future Monty Python member and film director Terry Gilliam and the earliest work of underground cartoonists such as Robert Crumb and Gilbert Shelton. He brought Help! to an end after the success of the risqu√© Playboy feature Little Annie Fanny began to take up his time. While Annie Fanny provided much of his income for the rest of his career, he continued to produce an eclectic body of work, including screenwriting the animated Mad Monster Party? in 1967 and directing, writing and designing several shorts for Sesame Street in 1969. From 1973, Kurtzman taught cartooning at the School of Visual Arts in New York. His work gained greater recognition toward the end of his life, and he oversaw deluxe reprintings of much of his work. The Harvey Award was named in Kurtzman's honor in 1988. He was inducted into the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 1989, and his work earned five positions on The Comics Journals Top 100 Comics of the 20th Century. Personal and professional history =Early life (1924‚Äì1942)= Harvey Kurtzman spoke little of his parents in interviews, and not much is known of their pre-American lives. David Kurtzman and Edith Sherman grew up in Ukraine in Odessa, and were literate urbanites. They belonged to the city's large Jewish community, and the city had fallen into economic hardship following the Russian Revolution. Shortly after World War I David emigrated to New York and Edith soon followed in what she called \\"a desperate journey\\" escaping the new Soviet Union. There the non-observant pair married in a civil ceremony. The first of their two sons, Zachary, was born April 8, 1923. Harvey Kurtzman was born on October 3, 1924, in a tenement building on 428 East Ninety-Eighth Street in Brooklyn in New York City. David joined the Christian Science church, and when he suffered a bleeding ulcer he turned to prayer to cure it; he died from it on November 29, 1928, at age 36. The family was in such desperate financial straits that their mother placed the Kurtzman brothers in an orphanage for three months until she secured work as a milliner. Several months later, Edith remarried to Russian-Jewish immigrant Abraham Perkes, who worked in the printing industry as a brass engraver. The Kurtzman boys kept their surname, while their mother took that of Perkes. The couple had a son Daniel on February 17, 1931. In 1934, the family moved to the more upscale Bronx, where the family lived at 2166 Clinton Avenue. Perkes was not wealthy, but managed to provide for his family during the Great Depression of the 1930s. He was a trade unionist, and the couple read the communist newspaper Daily Worker. Perkes brought young Kurtzman to work, and encouraged him to help with design and drawing and to think of himself as a professional artist. Young Kurtzman imitated the work of Rube Goldberg. Though he was a shy boy his teachers recognized Kurtzman's intelligence in grade school and allowed him to skip a grade. He displayed artistic talent early and his sidewalk chalk drawings drew the attention of children and adults, who gathered around to watch him draw. He called these strips \\"Ikey and Mikey\\", inspired by Goldberg's comic strip Mike and Ike. His stepfather also had an interest in art and took the boys to museums. His mother encouraged his artistic development and enrolled him in art lessons; on Saturdays, he took the subway to Manhattan for formal art instruction. His parents had him attend the left-leaning Jewish Camp Kinderland, but he did not enjoy its dogmatic atmosphere. Though not ashamed of their Jewish heritage, neither of the Kurtzman brothers agreed to have a Bar Mitzvah. Kurtzman fell in love with comic strips and the newly emerging comic books in the late 1930s. Unsatisfied with what he found in his parents' newspapers, he searched through garbage cans for the Sunday comics sections of his neighbors' newspapers. He admired a wide variety of strips, including Hamlin's Alley Oop, Caniff's Terry and the Pirates, Gould's Dick Tracy, Foster's Prince Valiant, Raymond's Flash Gordon, and Capp's Li'l Abner. He found Will Eisner's comic book The Spirit a \\"standard by which other comic books would be measured\\", and called Eisner \\"the greatest ... a virtuoso cartoonist of a kind who had never been seen before\\". Eisner's page layouts had considerable influence on Kurtzman's work. At 14 Kurtzman won a cartooning contest for which he received a dollar and had his cartoon published in Tip Top Comics 36 (April 1939). Future collaborator Jack Davis had won the same contest a few issues earlier. After winning the annual John Wanamaker Art Contest, Kurtzman received a scholarship to attend high school at The High School of Music & Art. Future colleagues Will Elder, Al Feldstein, Al Jaffee, John Severin, and Charles Stern also attended the school. Kurtzman graduated at 16 in 1941 and went on to Cooper Union on a scholarship. Kurtzman left after a year to focus on making comic books. =Early career (1942‚Äì1949)= Kurtzman assisted on the Classics Illustrated version of Moby Dick in 1942 as his first assignment at Louis Ferstadt's studio. Kurtzman met Alfred Andriola in 1942, encouraged by a quote in Martin Sheridan's Classic Comics and their Creators where Andriola offered help to aspiring cartoonists. Kurtzman made an appointment, but Andriola's response to his work was discouraging‚Äîhe told Kurtzman to give up on cartooning. Kurtzman called this meeting \\"one of the worst days of life\\", though he ignored Andriola's advice and continued to peddle his portfolio. Kurtzman continued to do odd jobs in 1942 until he got his first break in the comics industry at Louis Ferstadt's studio, which produced comics for Quality, Ace, Gilberton, and the Daily Worker. His first published work there was assisting on issue #5 (September 1942) of Gilberton's Classic Comics, which features an adaptation of Moby Dick. His first pencil job appeared in Four Favorites #8 (December 1942). He produced a large amount of undistinguished work in 1942 and 1943, which he later called \\"very crude, very ugly stuff\\", before he was drafted in 1943 for service in World War II. Kurtzman trained for the infantry, but was never sent overseas. He was stationed in Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas. He illustrated instruction manuals, posters, and flyers, and contributed cartoons to camp newspapers, and newsletters. While there, he was invited by publisher and cartoonist L. B. Cole to draw the \\"Black Venus\\" superheroine, packaged for publisher Rae Herman's Orbit Publications. In 1944, he did work for several local publications while stationed in North Carolina, and had several gag cartoons in Yank by the end of October 1945. The quantity of work allowed Kurtzman to hone his style, which became more refined and distinct. After his discharge following the war, Kurtzman found competition fierce in the comics industry, as freelancing replaced the system of packaging shops. He applied to the newspaper PM, but his portfolio was rejected by cartoon editor Walt Kelly. After a series of short-lived assignments and partnerships, Kurtzman got together with former Music and Art alumni Will Elder and Charles Stern. They opened Charles William Harvey Studio in 1947, but had difficulty getting work. The three had little business sense. Kurtzman managed the bills. In their Broadway studio, which Kurtzman kept open until the end of 1951, they sublet space to cartoonists such as John Severin, Dave Berg, and Ren√© Goscinny. Kurtzman had been doing crossword puzzles for publisher Martin Goodman since early in his career. A distant relative of Goodman's, Stan Lee, worked as an editor for Goodman's Timely Comics (a precursor to Marvel Comics). He offered Kurtzman work doing one-page fillers, work that paid little. Lee named the strip Hey Look!, and Kurtzman produced 150 episodes of it from 1946 until 1949. At an Art and Music reunion in early 1946 Kurtzman met Adele Hasan, who was one of the staff members at Timely and was dating Will Elder. She fell for Kurtzman, confiding to Al Jaffee that he \\"was the kind of kind like to marry\\". Later in the year, Timely ran a \\"Now You Can Be the Editor!\\" contest whose ballots Hasan was assigned to sort through. She was disappointed that readers did not enjoy Kurtzman's Hey Look! as much as she did. She \\"stuffed the ballot box\\" in Kurtzman's favor, which prompted an astonished Stan Lee to assign Kurtzman more work. Kurtzman was given the funny animal feature Pigtales at regular freelance rates, as well as miscellaneous other assignments. As Harvey stopped by the Timely offices more frequently, he and Adele would flirt, and eventually started dating. She left Timely for college that autumn, and corresponded frequently with Kurtzman; soon she dropped out of college and the two married that September. In 1948 Kurtzman produced a Sunday comic strip, Silver Linings, which ran infrequently in the New York Herald Tribune between March and June. Lee had Hey Look! brought to an end in 1949 so Kurtzman could concentrate on longer features for Timely's family-oriented line. Kurtzman was assigned artwork duties for the Lee-scripted Rusty, an imitation of Chic Young's comic strip Blondie, but was disappointed with this type of work and began looking for other employment. He sold episodes of the one-pagers Egghead Doodle and Genius to Timely and Al Capp's Toby Press on a freelance basis. He also sold longer pieces to Toby, including episodes of his Western parody Pot Shot Pete, a short-lived series that hinted at the pop-culture satire Kurtzman was to become known for. Kurtzman came across Charles Biro's Crime Does Not Pay, a comic book Kurtzman describes as reading with \\"the same excitement ... that felt about the underground comic books of twenty years later\\". These stories presented a view of reality quite different from the escapist entertainment typical of comics of the day, and was to influence the war and social drama work Kurtzman was soon to do at EC Comics. =EC and Mad (1949‚Äì1956)= Kurtzman continued to shop his work around, and produced work for Ace/Periodical, Quality, Aviation Press, Timely, and the magazines Varsity and Parents. He did a number of children's books, four of which were collaborations with Ren√© Goscinny. He brought some samples of educational comics into the EC Comics offices‚Äî\\"EC\\" had originally stood for \\"Educational Comics\\" when it was run by Max Gaines, but his son Bill changed the company's focus and name to \\"Entertaining Comics\\" when he inherited the business. Gaines liked Kurtzman's Hey Look! samples but had no immediate use for his particular skills. Gaines directed Kurtzman to his brother, David, who gave him some low- paying work on Lucky Fights it Through, a two-fisted cowboy story with an educational health message about syphilis. Kurtzman worked for EC Comics from 1950 to 1956. With the doors to EC open to him Kurtzman started getting regular work from the publisher in 1950. That spring, EC's \\"New Trend\\" line of horror, fantasy, and science fiction comics began, and Kurtzman contributed stories in these genres. His income doubled over the previous year's. In late 1950, he began writing and editing an adventure title, Two-Fisted Tales, which he proposed as a comic book in the vein of Roy Crane's popular comic strip, Captain Easy. The comic book differed in offering realistic stories in place of Crane's idealism, a degree of realism not yet seen in American comics. The war stories of Frontline Combat followed in mid-1951. The stories were not only about modern war, but also derived from deep in history, such as the Roman legions and Napoleonic campaigns. Kurtzman rejected the idealization of war that had swept the US since World War II. He spent hours in the New York Public Library in search of the detailed truth behind the stories he was writing, sometimes taking days or weeks to research a story. His research included interviewing and corresponding with GIs taking a ride aboard a rescue plane, and sending his assistant Jerry DeFuccio for a ride in a submarine to gather sound effects. (DeFuccio's first field report from this assignment was a 10-word telegram to Kurtzman reading \\"MANY BRAVE HEARTS ARE ASLEEP IN THE DEEP GLUB GLUB.\\") The stories gave a sympathetic look to both sides of a conflict, regardless of nationality or ethnicity. He sought to tell what he saw as the objective truth about war, deglamorizing it and showing its futility, though the stories were not explicitly anti-war. Kurtzman was given a great deal of artistic freedom by Gaines, but was himself a strict taskmaster. He insisted that the artists who drew his stories not deviate from his layouts. The artists generally respected Kurtzman's wishes out of respect for his creative authority, but some, like Bernie Krigstein and Dan Barry, felt their own artistic autonomy impinged upon. Kurtzman is best known for creating Mad in 1952. Those who worked for EC received payment based on output. Kurtzman's laborious working methods meant he was less prolific than fellow EC writer and editor Al Feldstein, and Kurtzman felt financially underappreciated for the amount of effort he poured into his work. He was financially burdened with a mortgage and a family. He also detested the horror content of the books Feldstein was producing, and which consistently outsold his own work. He believed these stories had the same sort of influence on children that the chauvinism of war comics which he believed he worked hard against in his own work. Remembering Kurtzman's humor work from the 1940s, Gaines proposed a humor magazine to increase Kurtzman's income, as he believed it would take far less time and effort to research. Mad debuted in August 1952, and Kurtzman scripted every story in the first twenty-three issues. The stories in Mad targeted what Kurtzman saw as fundamental untruths in the subjects parodied, inspired by the irreverent humor found in college humor magazines. They were developed in the same incremental way Kurtzman had developed for the war stories, and his layouts were followed faithfully by the artists who drew them‚Äîmost frequently, Will Elder, Jack Davis and Wally Wood. Mad did not have instant success, but found its audience by the fourth issue, which quickly sold out. The issue featured the Wood-drawn \\"Superduperman\\", a parody of Superman and Captain Marvel, including the copyright infringement lawsuit that National Periodicals (now DC Comics) had recently brought against Fawcett Comics. National, the owners of Superman's copyright, threatened to file another lawsuit over the parody. EC and National shared the same lawyer, who advised Gaines to quit publishing parodies. While Gaines was weighing this advice, Kurtzman discovered a legal precedent that backed Mads right to parody. Gaines hired the author of that precedent to write a brief substantiating EC's position, but the lawyer sided with National. Gaines consulted a third lawyer, who advised Gaines to ignore the threat and continue publishing parodies. National never filed suit. When Kurtzman parodied National's Batman character just four issues later, the spoof included six separate picket signs, posters and other notices proclaiming that \\"Batboy and Rubin\\" was a comedic imitation (e.g. \\"Not a spittoon, not a cartoon, not a harpoon, but a LAMPOON!\\") Parodying specific targets became a staple of Mad. Beginning April 1954, the bimonthly Mad went monthly after the cancelation of Frontline Combat, whose sales had flagged when the Korean War ended. Soon, large numbers of Mad imitators sprang up from other publishers, as well as from EC itself with the Feldstein-edited Panic. Kurtzman poured himself into Mad, putting as much effort into it as he had into his war books. This defeated the purpose of having an easy-to-produce third book, but with Frontline Combats cancelation, Kurtzman focused on Mad. During the early 1950s, Kurtzman became one of the writers for Dan Barry's relaunched Flash Gordon daily comic strip. He scripted two sequences for the strip, with portions pencilled by Frank Frazetta. The strip soon became one of Mads targets in \\"Flesh Garden!\\", drawn by Wood, who had earlier assisted Barry on the Flash Gordon strip. In 1954, Kurtzman dreamed up a full-color, 100-page adaptation of Dickens' A Christmas Carol called Marley's Ghost, and proposed the project to Simon & Schuster and other publishers. The proposal included seven finished pages, as well as a page redone by Jack Davis in case publishers' rejections were due to Kurtzman's drawing style. The ambitious project did not find a willing publisher, as comics were still seen as too low-brow for such lavish treatment. Since the 1940s, crime and horror comics had been drawing fire from those worried about a rise in juvenile delinquency. The Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency brought pressure on such comic books in 1954, and EC, one of the major purveyors of such fare, found their wares being refused by their distributor. Gaines brought those titles to an end and tried to replace them with the New Direction line, but by autumn 1955 the only remaining EC title was Mad. Gaines had just allowed Kurtzman to change Mads format to a magazine in July, in order to keep him at EC after Kurtzman had received an offer of employment from Pageant magazine. appropriated the \\"Me Worry?\\" character as Mads mascot, Alfred E. Neuman. Kurtzman had long dreamed of joining the slick magazine publishing world, and had been trying to convince Gaines to publish Mad in a larger, more adult format. The August issue of Pageant featured an article \\"Now Comics Have Gone Mad\\", and Pageants publisher Alex Hillman offered Kurtzman a job. With the prospect of losing his lone editor and writer, Gaines gave in to Kurtzman's demands. The magazine-format twenty-fourth issue of Mad (July 1955) was more successful than anticipated, and had to be reprinted, an unusual occurrence in magazine publishing. The new presentation was ambitious, and included meticulously rendered advertisement parodies and text pieces by humorists such as Ernie Kovacs, Stan Freberg, and Steve Allen. It was around this time that Kurtzman introduced Mads gap-toothed mascot and his slogan, \\"What, me worry?\\", whom Feldstein later named Alfred E. Neuman. Elsewhere, the one-time cartoonist Hugh Hefner had become a media mogul by the mid-1950s with his Playboy magazine. He had admired Kurtzman's Mad, and met Kurtzman in New York to express his appreciation. He told Kurtzman that if he were ever to leave Mad, a place would be waiting for him in the Hefner empire. With this promise to back him, Kurtzman demanded legal control of Mad from Gaines in the form of stocks. Reluctant to lose the editor of his sole remaining publication, Gaines offered a 10% share. As this would not give Kurtzman the control he wanted, Kurtzman countered with a demand for 51%. Gaines refused, and the two parted ways. Kurtzman contacted Hefner and Gaines hired Al Feldstein to edit Mad. =Trump, Humbug and Jungle Book (1957‚Äì1959)= With Trump (1957), Kurtzman began a long relation with Hugh Hefner and Playboy. Hefner employed Kurtzman from April 1956. The slick, full-color Trump appeared on newsstands in January 1957. Cartoonists who contributed to Trump included Mad regulars such as Elder, Wood, Davis, and Jaffee, as well as Russ Heath and newer artists such as Irving Geis, Arnold Roth, and R. O. Blechman. Writers Mel Brooks, Roger Price, Doodles Weaver, and Max Shulman also made contributions. The fifty-cent magazine was a luxurious, more risqu√© version of Mad, and sold well. Unfortunately, Hefner began to have financial problems, and canceled Trump after its second issue. The magazine had been a success in the market, but had already accrued $100,000 in expenses, about which Hefner quipped, \\"I gave Harvey Kurtzman an unlimited budget, and he exceeded it.\\" Hefner delivered the news in person to Kurtzman‚Äîin the hospital where his third child, Elizabeth, was being born. Adele said it was the only time she had seen her husband cry. Kurtzman later said that Trump was the closest he ever came to producing \\"the perfect humor magazine\\". While the Trump artists were mulling over the situation in the Playboy offices, Roth approached with a bottle of scotch. By the time they left the office, the group had agreed to embark on a publishing venture of their own: Humbug. The publication was financed and run by the artists who created it, though none of the group had business experience. Only artist Jack Davis became an equal shareholder and the only salaried employee despite declining to financially back the project; his participation was considered vital to its success. The others would joke in years to come that Davis was the only one to make any money from Humbug. With Kurtzman in the lead the reinvigorated, close-knit group set out to produce a classy publication in the vein of college humor magazines, but aimed at a general readership. Along with the pop-cultural satire that had been the staple of Mad and Trump, Humbug included more topical and political satire, mostly from writers other than Kurtzman. Hefner provided the group desirable office space at an inexpensive rate, out of guilt for canceling Trump so quickly. Humbug ran into snags right away due to its small format, which made it difficult for consumers to find it on the newsstands. It also suffered distribution problems. For its last two issues, Humbug was printed in a standard magazine size, and the price was raised from fifteen cents to twenty-five. At the last minute, the page count of the eleventh issue was increased from thirty-two pages to forty-eight, reprinting material from Trump. This last issue included a self-deprecating message from Kurtzman which summarized the artists' careers and announced Humbugs farewell. The group followed divergent career paths following the breakup. After the demise of Humbug, Kurtzman spent a few years as a freelance contributor to magazines such as Playboy, Esquire, Madison Avenue, The Saturday Evening Post, TV Guide, and Pageant. With Elliot Caplin he produced a poorly received comic strip, Kermit the Hermit, among other miscellaneous work. In 1958 Kurtzman proposed a strip to TV Guide parodying adult Western TV shows; its rejection particularly disappointed him. In 1959, Ballantine Books was looking for something to replace its successful line of Mad mass-market paperback reprints after Gaines had taken it to another publisher. Ballantine had earlier published The Humbug Digest in the same format, though it fared poorly in the market. Kurtzman proposed a book of original material designed for the format, which Ian Ballantine, with reservations, accepted on faith out of respect for Kurtzman. Harvey Kurtzman's Jungle Book was the first mass-market paperback of original comics content in the United States, and to Kurtzman biographer Denis Kitchen was a precursor to the graphic novel. Whereas his Mad stories had been aimed at an adolescent audience, Kurtzman made Jungle Book for adults, which was unusual in American comics. Jungle Book sold poorly, but remained a favorite among its small number of devoted fans. If it had been a success, Kurtzman intended to continue with more books in the same vein. =Help! and Little Annie Fanny (1960‚Äì1965)= Kurtzman had \\"The Grasshopper and the Ant\\" printed in Esquire magazine in 1960. The strip was a social allegory of a hipster grasshopper and a hard-working ant with opposing worldviews, both of whom lose out in the end. It was a rarity for Kurtzman in that he created it in full color, rather in black-and-white lineart with color added afterward. Kurtzman once more proposed Marley's Ghost to a number of publishers in 1962, including The Saturday Evening Post, but again it was rejected. In 1960, Harvey teamed up with publisher James Warren to co-publish Help!. Warren Publishing ran the business end, while co-ownership of the magazine allowed Kurtzman the control that he wanted, though its tight budget restricted that control. The magazine made frequent use of fumetti photographic comics, which sometimes starred celebrities such as Woody Allen and a pre-Monty Python John Cleese. The first issue was cover-dated August 1960. Gloria Steinem and Terry Gilliam were among those the magazine employed. By the end of its run, Help! had introduced a number of young cartoonists who were to play a major part in the movement, including Robert Crumb, Jay Lynch, Gilbert Shelton, Spain Rodriguez, and Skip Williamson. The parodic depictions of Archie Comics characters in \\"Goodman Goes Playboy\\" prompted a copyright infringement lawsuit. Help!s most famous story starred Kurtzman's character Goodman Beaver in \\"Goodman Goes Playboy\\" in the February 1962 issue. The story satirized Hefner and his lifestyle, while parodying Archie comics in a much more risqu√© way than the previous \\"Starchie\\" parody in Mad had. The Archie characters were drinking, partying skirt-chasers home from college. Archies publishers sued, and Warren agreed to settle out of court rather than risk an expensive lawsuit. The actual target of the strip had however been Hefner, who loved it; Kurtzman began working for Hefner again soon after. Kurtzman approached Hefner in 1960 with the idea of a comic strip feature for Playboy that would star Goodman Beaver. Playboy ran a lot of cartoons, but a comic strip was something new to the magazine. After discussing ideas, Kurtzman's proposal was accepted under the condition that Goodman Beaver be transformed into a voluptuous female. Little Annie Fanny was Playboy first comic strip and the first multi-page comics feature in an American slick magazine. As his primary collaborator, Kurtzman had Will Elder provide the strip's labor-intensive, fully painted full-color final rendering. Little Annie Fanny began appearing in Playboy in 1962. Kurtzman and Warren disagreed on Kurtzman's editorial decisions on Help!, and Kurtzman found himself unsatisfied with the partnership. Help!s sales were declining, and the magazine quietly came to an end with its twenty-sixth issue, cover-dated September 1965. This allowed Kurtzman and Elder to focus full-time on Little Annie Fanny. Hefner was a demanding editor and delivered critiques to Kurtzman that could reach twenty pages. =Later years (1965‚Äì1993)= Kurtzman participated in a number of film projects beginning in the late 1960s. He co- scripted the stop-motion animated film Mad Monster Party? (1967), a job he got through the recommendation of Jack Davis, who had been doing character designs for the film's production company Rankin/Bass. Kurtzman wrote, co-directed, and designed several short animated pieces for Sesame Street in 1969; he was particularly proud of the Phil Kimmelman-animated Boat, in which a left prosthetic-legged sea captain voiced by Hal Smith orders a series of increasingly larger numerals to load into a boat, eventually sinking it. In 1972, he appeared in a television advertisement for Scripto pens. Kurtzman turned down a number of well-paying opportunities in the 1970s. In early 1972, Stan Lee offered Kurtzman a senior position at Marvel Comics, and proposed another Mad-like magazine; Kurtzman turned these opportunities down, as he felt unprepared to return to the comic book industry after being out of it for so long since leaving EC. Marvel launched Crazy Magazine without him in 1973. Michael C. Gross asked him to contribute to National Lampoon around this time. The magazine's staff revered Kurtzman and had published a parody of Mad in 1971 that included \\"Citizen Gaines\\", a piece critical of Gaines' handling of Mad and treatment of Kurtzman. Kurtzman turned the offer down, as he felt out of step with the younger cartoonists' approach. He turned down an offer from Ren√© Goscinny in 1973 to act as the US agent for the French comics magazine Pilote. Kurtzman taught at the School of Visual Arts in the 1970s. In 1973, New York's School of Visual Arts asked Kurtzman and Will Eisner to take teaching positions there in cartooning. Kurtzman had no earlier teaching experience and found the prospect daunting, but Eisner convinced him to take the job. Eisner's class was called \\"Sequential Art\\" and Kurtzman's was \\"Satirical Cartooning\\", which focused on single-panel gag cartooning. Kurtzman had a soft touch with his students, and was well respected and well liked. He frequently had professional cartoonists appear as guest lecturers. When the school refused to publish his students' work, Kurtzman had them published in an ad-supported, student-produced anthology that came to be called Kar-T√ºnz. Kar-T√ºnz ran for fifteen years. Beginning in the late 1970s, Kurtzman's stature began to grow. His prot√©g√©s such as Crumb, Spiegelman and Gilliam sang his praises, his reputation grew with the spread of comics fandom, and collector Glenn Bray published The Illustrated Harvey Kurtzman Index in 1976. He also found he had a following in Europe; his work appeared there for the first time in the French magazine Charlie Mensuel in October 1970, and in 1973 the European Academy of Comic Book Art awarded him its Lifetime Achievement Award for 1972. A series of reprint projects and one-shot efforts appeared in the 1970s and 1980s, including Kurtzman Komix, published in 1976 by Kitchen Sink Press. In his later years, Kurtzman continued to work on anthologies and various other projects, including editing two volumes of a YA original anthology series, Nuts, packaged by Byron Preiss and published by Bantam Books in 1985. He oversaw reprints of his work in deluxe editions from Russ Cochran, who did The Complete EC Library, and Kitchen Sink Press, who did collections of Goodman Beaver (1984), Hey Look! (1992), and others, and reprinted Harvey Kurtzman's Jungle Book (1988). Lengthy interviews were conducted with The Comics Journal and Squa Tront. The comics industry's Harvey Award was named in his honor in 1988. Kurtzman toured and gave speeches frequently to fans in the 1980s. Kurtzman had reconciled with Gaines by the mid-1980s, and contributed some pieces to Mad with art by Elder. Kurtzman brought Little Annie Fanny to an end in 1988, amid failing health, a poor relationship with Playboy cartoon editor Michelle Urry, and resentment over the discovery that he did not own the rights to the strip. Harvey Kurtzman's Strange Adventures assembled a wide cast of cartoonists in 1990 to illustrate stories from Kurtzman's layouts, though the book was not a success, nor was a revival of Two-Fisted Tales. He had long planned to write a comics history, but other work had taken priority. Towards the end of his life, he agreed to collaborate with comics historian Michael Barrier to complete From Aargh! to Zap! Harvey Kurtzman's Visual History of the Comics, which was published in 1991, though it was shorter than the more complete history Kurtzman had planned. Kurtzman, who had suffered from Parkinson's disease and colon cancer in later life, died at Mount Vernon, New York on February 21, 1993, of complications from liver cancer, nine months after Bill Gaines' death. The New Yorker commissioned a commemorative cartoon by Will Elder and ran an elegy by writer Adam Gopnik. Cartoonist Jules Feiffer remarked at the time that cartooning had lost its Orson Welles. Personal life Kurtzman stood and was of slight build. He had an unassuming demeanor; humorist Roger Price likened him to \\"a beagle who is too polite to mention that someone is standing on his tail\\". Rolf Malcolm described him as someone who smiles little and speaks slowly. Al Jaffee said he \\"was not an easy person to get too close to\\". thumb Kurtzman and wife Adele (n√©e Hasan) were married in September 1948. They had three daughters and one son: Meredith, born July 28, 1950; Peter, born June 29, 1954; Elizabeth, born January 21, 1957; and Cornelia \\"Nellie\\", born April 15, 1969. (Meredith in 1970 went on to become one of the contributors to It Ain't Me, Babe, the first comic book produced entirely by women.)Fox, M. Steven. \\"It Ain't Me Babe,\\" ComixJoint. Accessed Dec. 3, 2016. Kurtzman's work allowed him to be at home with his children during the day, and he gave them much of his attention. As Peter had low- functioning autism, the Kurtzmans volunteered locally for work with special needs children, and in 1986 began an annual charity auction, raising money by selling the artwork of cartoonists for the Association for Mentally Ill Children of Westchester, which Adele continued to oversee following her husband's death. Style and working method According to Kurtzman, \\"Cartooning consists of the two elements, graphics and texts ... Obviously it is to the advantage of the total product to have good text and good art and the more closely integrated the good text and good art are, the greater the opportunity is to create the capital-A Art.\\" The stories he created and had others illustrate balance captions and dialogue, in contrast with, for example, Al Feldstein's EC stories, in which the artists had to compensate for the text which dominated the page. In the war stories he drew himself he employed an drawing style that distorted figures in expressive ways more akin to modern art than the stylizations of contemporary superhero or funny animal comics. R. C. Harvey described this style as \\"abstract and telepathic\\" in stories that were realistic in the telling, but in which \\"his figures were exaggerated and contorted, demonstrations of posture as drama rather than reality as perceived\\". French comics historian Jacques Dutrey described Kurtzman's style as \\"movement and shapes, energy and aesthetics\\". Many liken Kurtzman's working method to that of an auteur. In developing stories in this way Kurtzman aimed to reach a balance between text and graphics. He developed a way of creating stories incrementally, beginning with a paragraph-long treatment of the story. After deciding on a story and an ending which had impact, he laid out thumbnail sketches in miniature, with captions and dialogue. He proceeded to revise repeatedly on tracing paper, tacking one layer on top of another, as he worked out \\"what characters have to say\\". He prepared layouts on large pieces of vellum to pass on to the artists, with supplemental photographs and drawings, and personally led the artist through the story before the finished artwork was begun. According to Jack Davis, \\"When you'd pick up a story, Harvey would sit down with you and he ... acted it out, all the way through ... You felt like you'd lived the story.\\" Typically when working on Little Annie Fanny, after researching the background story, Kurtzman prepared a penciled layout on Bristol board a color guide for Elder on an vellum overlay. He would then create a larger version of the page on vellum with a image area, which he would create using colored markers, working his way up from lighter to darker colors as he tightened the composition. He then traced this onto another sheet of vellum, or more if still unsatisfied with the results. He would pass this on to Elder to render the final image following Kurtman's layouts exactly after having the image transferred to illustration board. Kurtzman's layouts owed considerable debt to Will Eisner's work on The Spirit. He derived a chiaroscuro technique from Milt Caniff in his 1940s studio work. Legacy Along with cartoonists such as Will Eisner, Jack Kirby, and Carl Barks, Kurtzman is regularly cited as one of the defining creators of the Golden Age of American comic books. In 2003, The New York Times described Kurtzman as \\"one of the most important figures in postwar America\\" over Mads influence on popular culture. This was an upgrade from the Times' obituary for Kurtzman in 1993, which said he had \\"helped found Mad Magazine.\\" This prompted an angry response to the newspaper from Art Spiegelman, who complained that awarding Kurtzman partial credit for starting Mad was \\"like saying Michelangelo helped paint the Sistine Chapel just because some Pope owned the ceiling.\\"Robert Boyd The Pan Review of Books: Harvey Kurtzman: The Man Who Created Mad and Revolutionized Humor in America June 14, 2015 thegreatgodpanisdead.com Kurtzman mentored cartoonists such as Robert Crumb. Kurtzman acted as mentor to a large number of cartoonists, such as Terry Gilliam, Robert Crumb, and Gilbert Shelton. Students of his at the School of Visual Arts included John Holmstrom, Batton Lash, and Drew Friedman. Kurtzman, and particularly his work on Mad, is the most frequently cited influence on the movement‚Äîcomics historian Mark Estren called Mad \\"the granddaddy of the underground \\". In 1958, Robert Crumb and his older brother Charles self-published three issues of the Humbug-inspired fanzine Foo in 1958. The venture was not a financial success, and Crumb turned to producing comics to satisfy himself. In 1964 Kurtzman published his work in Help!. Kurtzman's style of humor influenced countercultural comedians from the 1960s on, including the sketch comedy series Saturday Night Live, according to member Harry Shearer. Help! contributor Terry Gilliam, who went on to be a member of Monty Python, called Kurtzman \\"n many ways ... one of the godparents of Monty Python\\". In his 1985 film Brazil, Terry Gilliam gave Ian Holm's character the name \\"Kurtzmann\\". Underground cartoonist Robert Crumb asserted that one of Kurtzman's cover images for Humbug \\"changed [his] life\\" and that another Mad cover image \\"changed the way [he] saw the world forever!\\" On Kurtzman's influence Time editor Richard Corliss stated, \\"Almost all American satire today follows a formula that Harvey Kurtzman thought up.\\" Discussion panel on Jungle Book at the 2014 New York Comic Con. From left to right are Kurtzman's daughter, Nellie, David Hajdu, Denis Kitchen, Jay Lynch, John Holmstrom, and Bill Kartalopoulos. While some, such as R. C. Harvey considered it a masterpiece, others such as Michael Dooley felt Little Annie Fanny was \\"known more for its lavish production values than its humor\\", or that it compromised Kurtzman's genius. A minority of underground cartoonists considered him a sell out for compromising his ideals by working for Playboy for twenty-six years. Many fans consider Help! to be Kurtzman's \\"last hurrah\\". The Kirby Awards came to an end in 1987, and the Harvey Awards and Eisner Awards took its place. Named in Kurtzman's honor, the Harveys are administered by Fantagraphics Books, and nominees and winners are selected by comics professionals. Kurtzman was one of seven cartoonists featured in the traveling \\"Masters of American Comics\\" exhibition in 2005‚Äì2006. To Comics Journal editor and Fantagraphics publisher Gary Groth, Kurtzman's style \\"achieves some sort of Platonic ideal of cartooning. Harvey was a master of composition, tone and visual rhythm, both within the panel and among the panels comprising the page. He was also able to convey fragments of genuine humanity through an impressionistic technique that was fluid and supple.\\" Comics critic and historian R. C. Harvey conjectured that Kurtzman \\"may be the most influential American cartoonist since Walt Disney\\", and comics historian Don Markstein considered him \\"among the most influential cartoonists of the 20th century\\". In its list of the 20th century's best hundred English-language comics, The Comics Journal awarded Kurtzman five of the slots: # * Mad 1‚Äì, 1952‚Äì1956, Edited by Harvey Kurtzman # * The War Comics of Harvey Kurtzman, 1950‚Äì1955, Harvey Kurtzman and various # * Harvey Kurtzman's Jungle Book, 1959 # * Hey Look!, 1946‚Äì1949, Harvey Kurtzman # * Goodman Beaver, 1962, Harvey Kurtzman & Will Elder In 2012, Kurtzman's estate and Al Feldstein filed to reclaim the copyrights on their 1950s work at EC. The claim was based on changes to copyright laws made in 1976, in which copyrights sold could be reclaimed by the original independent creators at the time of copyright renewal. Under these laws Jerry Siegel's estate was able to regain rights to Superman from DC Comics, but work-made-for-hire creations by Jack Kirby and Marv Wolfman were found ineligible. The basis of the Kurtzman and Feldstein claims was that they were not employees of EC, but subcontractors. Comics collector Glenn Bray published The Illustrated Harvey Kurtzman Index in 1976, a complete guide to everything Kurtzman had published to that point. Howard Zimmerman adapted interviews with Kurtzman conducted by Zimmerman and Byron Preiss into a short autobiography in 1988 titled Harvey Kurtzman: My Life as a Cartoonist.Kurtzman, Harvey & Zimmerman, Howard: My Life As A Cartoonist by Harvey Kurtzman Byron Preiss Visual Publications, Inc. (paperback) 1988. Denis Kitchen and Paul Buhle produced a biography of Kurtzman in 2009 titled The Art of Harvey Kurtzman: The Mad Genius of Comics, with an introduction by comedian Harry Shearer. Bill Schelly spent three years to research and write another, longer one in 2015, titled Harvey Kurtzman: The Man Who Created MAD and Revolutionized Humor in America, with an introduction by Terry Gilliam. In 2014, Dark Horse Comics via their Kitchen Sink Books imprint began reprinting deluxe, expanded editions of Kurtzman work in The Essential Kurtzman series, beginning with Harvey Kurtzman‚Äôs Jungle Book, edited and designed by John Lind and including new essays on the work from Lind, Denis Kitchen, R.Crumb, Peter Poplaski, and an introduction by Gilbert Shelton. The work received two nominations (Best Reprint and Excellence in Publication) in the 2015 Harvey Awards. The second volume in the series Playboy‚Äôs TRUMP, a collection of the 1950s satire magazine created by Kurtzman and Hugh Hefner, was published in 2016.

Kemeny set in motion the then revolutionary concept of making computers as freely available to college students as library books were, by implementing the concept of time-sharing at Dartmouth College. In his mission to allow non- expert users to interact with the computer, he co-developed the BASIC programming language (Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) and the Dartmouth Time Sharing System during 1963 to 1964. A native of Oak Park, Illinois, United States, Kurtz graduated from Knox College in 1950, and was awarded a Ph.D. degree from Princeton University in 1956, where his advisor was John Tukey, and joined the Mathematics Department of Dartmouth College that same year, where he taught statistics and numerical analysis. In 1983, Kurtz and Kemeny co-founded a company called True BASIC, Inc. to market True BASIC, an updated version of the language. Kurtz has also served as Council Chairman and Trustee of EDUCOM, as well as Trustee and Chairman of NERComP, and on the Pierce Panel of the President's Scientific Advisory Committee. Kurtz also served on the steering committees for the CONDUIT project and the CCUC conferences on instructional computing. In 1974, the American Federation of Information Processing Societies gave an award to Kurtz and Kemeny at the National Computer Conference for their work on BASIC and time-sharing. In 1991, the Computer Society honored Kurtz with the IEEE Computer Pioneer Award and in 1994 he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery. Early life and education In 1951, Kurtz' first experience with computing came at the Summer Session of the Institute for Numerical Analysis at University of California, Los Angeles. His interests have included numerical analysis, statistics, and computer science ever since. He graduated in 1950 when he obtained his bachelor's degree majoring in mathematics and in 1956, at the age of 28, he went on to acquire his PhD from Princeton University. His thesis was on a problem of multiple comparisons in mathematical statistics. Kurtz composed his first computer program in 1951 while working with computers at UCLA in the institute of numerical analysis. He performed this feat just after finishing grad school and one year into his tuition at Princeton University. Dartmouth In 1963 to 1964, Kurtz and Kemeny developed the first version of the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System, a time-sharing system for university use, and the BASIC language. From 1966 to 1975, Kurtz served as Director of the Kiewit Computation Center at Dartmouth, and from 1975 to 1978, Director of the Office of Academic Computing. From 1980 to 1988 Kurtz was Director of the Computer and Information Systems program at Dartmouth, a ground-breaking multidisciplinary graduate program to develop IS leaders for industry. Subsequently, Kurtz returned to teaching full-time as a Professor of Mathematics, with an emphasis on statistics and computer science. Dartmouth College BASIC As part of the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System, Kemeny and Kurtz created the BASIC programming language. The very first BASIC program ran on May 1, 1964 at 4 a.m., and neither Kemeny nor Kurtz thought of this as a start to something grand. They merely hoped it would help students learn something about the computers they were using. The pair made certain that their invention was immediately dispersed to the public and made no real money from it. Dartmouth College copyrighted BASIC; however it made BASIC available and free to anyone wanting to use it. The name for the language originated from Kurtz‚Äôs wish to have a simple acronym that meant something as well. Kurtz states that, ‚ÄúWe wanted a word that was simple but not simple- minded, and BASIC was that one.‚ÄùRobert Slater, 1987. Portraits in silicone., MIT Press BASIC along with the books published on it earned a lot of positive feedback, for example: ‚ÄúThis second edition of Basic Programming gives a thorough description of BASIC, which is useful not only for the beginner, but also for the more experienced programmer.‚Äù; ‚Äú My overall evaluation of BASIC programming is that it is ideal for the individual who wishes to program with a minimum of effort and of equal value for group or classroom instruction.‚Äù John G. Kemeny, Thomas E. Kurtz, and Anthony Feliu, 1972. BOOK AND FILM REVIEWS: Highly Recommended: Basic Programming, The Physics Teacher. February, 10, pg 103 The theme that BASIC was for the average computer user is stressed by Kurtz. In an open letter he reiterates upon past statements that BASIC was invented to give students a simple programming language that was easy to learn, as all the current languages of the time were dedicated to professionals. He then went on to say that BASIC was for people who did not want to dedicate their lives to programming. The repetition of this idea by Kurtz accentuates that even through all of his success the language he wrote would remain implemented for the masses and not just specialists. BASIC standards were created in the 1980s for the ECMA, and ANSI with their versions being released in 1986 and 1987 respectively. BASIC popularity skyrocketed in 1975 after a pair of youngsters in a Harvard dormitory, Bill Gates and Paul Allen, created a version of BASIC that was viable on one of the earliest personal computers. Gates and Allen‚Äôs version became the most prominent iterations of BASIC. =Influence= The road to BASIC itself was a long one. Kemeny and Kurtz had forged DARSIMCO ‚Äì Dartmouth Simplified Code ‚Äì Dartmouth‚Äôs inaugural attempt at making a computing language in 1956; however DARSIMCO soon became obsolete when the language FORTRAN manifested itself. In 1962 Kemeny and a Dartmouth undergraduate, Sidney Marshall, created the language DOPE, Dartmouth Oversimplified Programming Experiment, which was a direct predecessor of BASIC. DOPE itself was little used, and Kurtz preferred trying to implement successful languages such as FORTRAN and ALGOL. Kurtz's experience with Dartmouth ALGOL 30 for the LGP-30 convinced him that devising subsets of these languages was not quite practical, and this led him to adopt Kemeny‚Äôs notion of creating a new language entirely. =Critics= Although BASIC was widely regarded as a success, many computing professionals thought it was a poor choice for larger and more complicated programs. Larger programs became confusing and messy when they used the ‚ÄúGO TO‚Äù statement to jump from one line of a program to another. A further criticism of the original language was that it was unstructured, which made it difficult to split programs into separate parts to improve readability. BASIC not being structured also hindered the ability to debug and modify parts of the code, and this limited its use by larger companies. Hence it largely remained a language used for only smaller programs.Robert Slater, 1987. Portraits in silicone., MIT Press True BASIC True Basic example In 1983, in response to a proliferation of \\"Street BASICs,\\" a group of graduating Dartmouth students persuaded Kemeny and Kurtz to offer the Dartmouth version of the language as a commercial product. The first offering of their company, True Basic, Inc., was based on Dartmouth BASIC 7, which featured modern programming constructs such as ‚ÄúIF..THEN..ELSE, DO..LOOP and EXIT DO‚Äù. The company described its product as ‚ÄúSimple. Elegant. Powerful. True BASIC.‚Äú Upon Kemeny's advice, True BASIC was not limited to a single OS or computer system. ‚ÄúToday versions of True BASIC are available for DOS, Mac OS, Windows, Unix, and Linux systems‚Äù. When Kurtz retired from Dartmouth College in 1993, he continued to develop and maintain True Basic.

The plan was to be carried out by Serbian police and the Yugoslav army. Claims that the plan was being implemented were NATO's justification for their bombing of Yugoslavia during the Kosovo War. Human Rights Watch said that in early 1999, the Yugoslav army and the Serbian police \\"in an organized manner, with significant use of state resources\\" conducted a broad campaign of violence against Albanian civilians to expel them from Kosovo and thus maintain political control of Belgrade over the province. In 2011, former Bulgarian Foreign Minister Nadezhda Mihaylova (Neynsky) revealed in a TV documentary that the Bulgarian government had turned over to Germany an unverified report compiled by its military agency which \\"made clear\\" the existence of the plan, even though the military intelligence warned that the information could not be verified. Horseshoe plan Horseshoe plan (German: Hufeisenplan) was an alleged Yugoslavian plan to expel the Albanian population of Kosovo. The operation's title suggest that the Yugoslav Army and police would squeeze the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) and civilians in an attack launched from three sides, driving out the population as refugees fled through the open southwestern end of the horseshoe into Macedonia and Albania. The plan was detailed by German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer in a press conference on 7 April 1999. He stated that the German government had unearthed operational plans agreed by Yugoslav commanders in late February 1999 to carry out a massive ethnic cleansing operation in Kosovo. According to Fischer, this had been put into effect as early as March 1999 ‚Äî a month before the start of NATO operations ‚Äî when Yugoslav President Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá had told him that \\"he would be finished with the ethnic Albanian separatists within a week\\". Fischer accused Milo≈°eviƒá of engaging in \\"ethnic warfare\\" directed against his own people, in which a whole ethnic group had become the \\"victim of systematic expulsion\\" to \\"reorient the political geography\\" of Kosovo. Kosovar refugees in Republic of Macedonia, Albania and Montenegro (April 1999). Reports from other countries supported Fischer's allegations. The Times of London reported on 8 April that: Further details were provided on 9 April by Rudolf Scharping, the German Defence Minister, at a press conference held in Bonn. He presented maps containing the names of towns and villages which showed arrows representing Yugoslav army and police militia units progressively encircling Kosovo in a horseshoe-shaped pincer movement. He was quoted as saying that: \\"Operation Horseshoe provided clear evidence that President Milo≈°evic (sic) had long been preparing the expulsions from Kosovo and that he had simply used the time gained by the Rambouillet peace talks to organise army and police units for the campaign.\\" The Baltimore Sun suggested on 11 April that NATO had known about the Horseshoe plan for some time, but had underestimated its severity. The then British Foreign Secretary later supported the German reports, telling a parliamentary committee \\"that there was a plan developed in Belgrade known as Operation Horseshoe which was for the cleansing of Kosovo of its Kosovo population. That plan has been around for some time.\\" According to Radio Television of Serbia the report was drafted by Bulgarian intelligence services based on the analysis of early 1999 events. Former Bulgarian foreign minister Nadezhda Neynsky acknowledged in 2012 that the then-Bulgarian government had delivered information to Germany and NATO about Milo≈°eviƒá's alleged plan to ethnically cleanse Kosovo. She said she had delivered the document about the operation to the then German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, in April 1999, although Neynsky had denied doing so in March 2000.\\"Hufeisen: 'Auch sie dementiert'\\" abendblatt.de, 30 March 2000; archived 28 February 2013. Neynsky stressed that Germany's Foreign Minister Fischer took the report of the Bulgarian military intelligence very seriously. She also said the Bulgarian government back in 1999 decided to provide NATO with the report on the Horseshoe plan even though Bulgarian military intelligence warned that the information could not be verified.Bulgaria Leaked Milosevic's Kosovo Ethnic Cleansing Plan in 1999, novinite.com, 9 January 2012; archived 28 February 2013. Yugoslav Army military operations =Operations before NATO intervention= Ruins near Morin√´ in the White Drin valley, at the border between Albania and Kosovo. Morina was attacked on 23/24 May 1998 by the Yugoslav Army. Yugoslav Army military response to KLA attacks culminated in Operation Horseshoe directed not only against KLA fighters but also including systematic expulsions of Kosovar civilians. During the armed conflict in 1998 Yugoslav Army and Serbian police used excessive and random force, which resulted in property damage, displacement of population and death of civilians Some date Operation Horseshoe's effective beginning to the summer of 1998, when hundreds of thousands of Kosovar Albanians were driven from their homes. Withdrawal of Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe monitors, together with the start of NATO's bombing campaign, encouraged Milo≈°eviƒá to implement this \\"orchestrated elements to the campaign of expulsions, which could be described as a plan\\". On 20 March 1999, the Serbian offensive, known as Operation Horseshoe, was already in motion. =Operations after NATO intervention= With the beginning of NATO bombing of Yugoslavia on 24 March 1999, Serbian forces accelerated Operation Horseshoe. In 1999, the Yugoslav Army, Serbian police and Serb paramilitary, in an organized manner, with significant use of state resources, conducted a broad campaign of violence against Albanian civilians to expel them from Kosovo and thus maintain political control of Belgrade over the province. According to the legally binding verdict of the ICTY, police after the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia (24 March 1999), federal Army and Serbian police systematically attacked villages with Albanian population, abused, robbed and killed civilians, ordering them to go to Albania or Montenegro, burning their houses and destroying by their property. Within the campaign of violence, Albanians were expelled en masse from their homes, murdered, sexually assaulted, and their religious buildings destroyed. Serbian forces committed numerous war crimes during the implementation of \\"joint criminal enterprise\\" whose aim was to \\"through the use of violence and terror, force a significant number of Kosovo Albanians to leave their homes, across the border, the state government to retain control over Kosovo.\\" Ethnic cleansing of the Albanian population is performed by the following model: first the army surrounded a place, then followed the shelling, then the police entered the village, and often with them and the army, and then crimes occurs (murders, rapes, beatings, expulsions...). identity cleansing, consisting of \\"confiscation of personal identification, passports, and other such documents to make it difficult or impossible for those driven out to return\\", was then reportedly employed. Expelled Kosovar Albanians were systematically stripped of identity and property documents including passports, land titles, automobile license plates, identity cards and other documents. Physicians for Human Rights reports that nearly 60 percent of respondents to its survey observed Serbian forces removing or destroying personal identification documents. This criminal practice suggesting the government was trying to block their return. In addition to confiscating the relevant documents from their holders, efforts were also made to destroy any actual birth records (and other archives) which were maintained by governmental agencies, so as to make the \\"cleansing\\" complete. Number of refugees According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, by March 1999 (prior to NATO bombing), more than 200,000 Albanian civilians were internally displaced, almost 70,000 Albanians had fled the province to neighboring countries and Montenegro, and a further 100,000 Yugoslav nationals, mostly Kosovar Albanians, had sought asylum in Western Europe.UNHCR Press Briefing Note: Kosovo, Tuesday, 2 February 1999. Also, thousands of ethnic Albanian villages in Kosovo had been partially or completely destroyed by burning or shelling.UNHCR Pristina,\\"IDP/Shelter Survey Kosovo: Joint Assessment in 20 Municipalities,\\" 12 November 1998. Within three weeks of the start of NATO strategic bombing during the Kosovo War, there were 525,787 refugees from Kosovo in neighboring countries.UNHCR Press Briefing Note: Kosovo, 13 April 1999. A month later, on 12 May, the total number of refugees had risen to 781,618.UNHCR Press Briefing Note: Kosovo, 13 May 1999. By June 1999, the Yugoslav military, Serbian police and paramilitaries expelled 862,979 Albanians from Kosovo, A claim disputed by many Serbian politicians.Statistic from: \\"The Kosovo refugee crisis: an independent evaluation of UNHCR's emergency preparedness and response\\", UNHCR Evaluation and Policy Analysis Unit, February 2000. and several hundred thousand more were internally displaced, in addition to those displaced prior to March. Approximately 440,000 refugees crossed the border to Albania and 320,000 to Macedonia. Montenegro hosted around 70,000 refugees, while Bosnia and Herzegovina received more than 30,000. Amnesty International estimated that \\"nearly one million people have been forced to flee Kosovo\\". Radio Television of Serbia never showed the columns of Albanians expelled by Serbian police and paramilitaries, except when a convoy of fleeing Albanians was killed by NATO bombs. Moreover, Milo≈°eviƒá's propaganda trying to convince international public that huge columns of refugees fleeing Kosovo because of NATO's bombing, not Yugoslav Army military operations. Indictments The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia charged Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá and other Yugoslav officials with crimes against humanity including murder, forcible population transfer, deportation and persecution of Kosovo civilians: * Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, President of Yugoslavia and Supreme Commander of the Yugoslav Army - died in 2006 during trial. * Dragoljub Ojdaniƒá, Chief of General Staff - sentenced to 15 years in prison; granted early release in August 2013. * Neboj≈°a Pavkoviƒá, Commander of Third Army, which was responsible for Kosovo - sentenced to 22 years in prison. * Vladimir Lazareviƒá, Commander of the Pristina Corps of Third Army - sentenced to 15 years in prison; granted early release, having served two thirds of his sentence, on 7 September 2015, effective 3 December 2015. * Vlajko Stojiljkoviƒá, Interior Minister and Commander of the Serbian police - committed suicide in 2002, after the adoption of a law on cooperation with the Hague Tribunal. * Sreten Lukiƒá, Chief of Staff of the Serbian Police in Kosovo - sentenced to 22 years in prison. Upon appeal, the sentence was reduced on 23 January 2014 to 20 years. * Nikola ≈†ainoviƒá, Deputy Prime Minister of Yugoslavia - sentenced to 22 years in prison. On 26 August 2015, three months after the request by his lawyers, he was released from the prison after serving (including pretrial detention and time served) two thirds of his sentence. * Milan Milutinoviƒá, President of the Republic of Serbia - acquitted. Presiding Judge Iain Bonomy when imposing sentence said that \\"deliberate actions of these forces during the campaign provoked the departure of at least 700,000 ethnic Albanians from Kosovo in the short period from late March to early June 1999.\\" Controversy The existence of the Horseshoe plan was immediately denied by the Yugoslav officials. Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá labeled it as a \\"fabrication of the German Defence Ministry\\". Milo≈°eviƒá denied a policy of ethnic cleansing during the NATO bombing in Kosovo, stated that \\"when aggression stops, when bombing stops, then it will be very easy to continue (the) political process\\". Ratomir Taniƒá, a witness at Milo≈°eviƒá's subsequent war crimes trial, said that Horseshoe was a colloquial nickname for a \\"completely different\\" Yugoslav army plan, that should come into effect only if the ethnic Albanian population take the side of the foreign aggressor in case of aggression on Yugoslavia. Then the Army would \\"neutralising the Albanian strongholds\\". Taniƒá stated that the army leadership didn't use this plan during the Kosovo War, \\"because there was no external aggression or Albanian rebellion\\". In April 2000, Heinz Loquai, a retired German brigadier general, published a book on the war that claimed that the German government's account had been based on a general analysis by a Bulgarian intelligence agency of Yugoslav behaviour in the war, which was turned into a specific \\"plan\\" by the German Defence Ministry.Heinz Loquai: Der Kosovo-Konflikt. Wege in einen vermeidbaren Krieg. Die Zeit von Ende November 1997 bis M√§rz 1999 (in German). Nomos Verlagsgesellschaft, Baden-Baden 2000, . According to Loquai, the Bulgarian analysis concluded that the goal of the Yugoslav government was to destroy the Kosovo Liberation Army, and not to expel the entire Albanian population. He also pointed to a factual flaw in the German government's presentation - it had named the plan \\"Potkova\\", which is the Croatian and Bulgarian word for horseshoe, whereas the Serbian word is potkovica. Aftermath It is unclear how much advance planning there was for the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo, but the removal of ethnic Albanians was counterproductive as, according to British reporter and political analyst Tim Judah, it removed any possibility that Serbia would be allowed to retain control of Kosovo.

Louis Claude Fr√©d√©ric Masson (8 March 1847, Paris ‚Äì 19 February 1923, Paris) was a French historian.  Life and career  His father, Francis Masson, a solicitor, was killed on 23 June 1848 when he was a major in the garde nationale. Young Masson was educated at the college of Sainte Barbe, and at the lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand, and then travelled in Germany and in England. From 1869 to 1880 he was librarian at the Foreign Office. At first he devoted himself to the history of diplomacy, and published between 1877 and 1884 several volumes connected with that subject. Later he published a number of more or less curious memoirs illustrating the history of the Revolution and of the empire. But he is best known for his books connected with Napoleon. In Napol√©on inconnu (1895), Masson, together with Guido Biagi, brought out the unpublished writings (1786-1793) of the future emperor. These were notes, extracts from historical, philosophical and literary books, and personal reflections in which one can watch the growth of the ideas later carried out by the emperor with modifications necessitated by the force of circumstances and his own genius. But this was only one in a remarkable series: *Jos√©phine de Beauharnais, 1763-1796 (1898) *Jos√©phine, imp√©ratrice et reine (1899) *Jos√©phine r√©pudi√©e 1809-1814 (1901) *L'Imp√©ratrice Marie Louise (1902) *Napol√©on et les femmes (1894) *Napol√©on et sa famille (9 vols., 1897-1907) *Napol√©on et son fils (1904) *Autour de l'√éle d'Elbe (1908). These works abound in details and amusing anecdotes, which throw much light on the events and men of the time, laying stress on the personal, romantic and dramatic aspects of history. The author was made a member of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1903. From 1886 to 1889 he edited the review Arts and Letters, published in London and New York. A bibliography of his works, including anonymous ones and those under an assumed name, has been published by Georges Vicaire (Manuel de l'amateur des livres du XIX si√®cle, tome v., 1904). Napol√©on et les femmes has been translated into English as Napoleon and the Fair Sex (1894). Another translation by J. M. Howell appeared under the title: Napoleon: lover and husband (1894). His personal library, his papers, his collection of paintings and objects about Napol√©on are conserved now in the Fondation Dosne-Thiers, 27 place Saint-Georges, 75009 Paris (France).

The publication is generally fortnightly, with a larger annual issue each December. History and structure The magazine was launched in January 1983 and is published by Penfield Enterprises Ltd. The magazine was established by John Mulcahy.Dublin, Ireland: The Irish Times, 7 Jan 2006, p. 14, \\"Publisher who became monarch of the magazine sector.\\" It had an ABC-audited circulation of 19,014 for 2004 and 18,268 in 2007.\\"Phoenix boast falls flat\\", Sunday Independent, 25 February 2007 The current editor is Paddy Prendiville, editor since about a year after the magazine was started. The name Phoenix is a reference to its \\"emergence from the ashes\\" of two of Mulcahy's previous publications. These were the republican political magazine Hibernia, which ceased publishing in 1980 after a libel action, and the Sunday Tribune newspaper, which first collapsed financially in 1982. The magazine secures much of its material from \\"insider\\" sources, and promotes contact with its Goldhawk phone line. Layout and style Features in the magazine include a news column; detailed profiles (\\"Pillars of Society\\" and \\"The Young Bloods\\"); \\"Affairs of the Nation\\", which looks at political scandals; \\"Bog Cuttings\\" which consists of humorous and unusual events outside Dublin (often bizarre court cases), \\"Hush Hush\\" and \\"On the beat\\", which deals with security and intelligence matters; and a satirical section, \\"Craic and Codology\\". It also has an extensive financial column, \\"Moneybags\\". Like Private Eye, the cover features a photo montage with a speech bubble, putting ironic or humorous comments into the mouths of the famous in response to topical events. Other features include an \\"Apology\\" section (where the magazine offers an ersatz apology for the failings or success of some person or event), \\"That Menu in Full\\", the use of (\\"That's enough of this. -Ed\\" type interjections) and their derivatives, and the Christmas Gift lists, where implausible gifts with ridiculous features are offered for sale. In contrast to Private Eye, the Phoenix is printed on magazine stock rather than newsprint, and uses colour, including photography, quite extensively. =Taoiseach parodies= A fixture in The Phoenix magazine is a full-page parody of the Taoiseach of the day, always located in the \\"Craic and Codology\\" section: *Bertie Ahern, whose Northside Dublin accent and frequent habit of using mixed metaphors and phrases was noted, was parodied in the Diary of a Nordsoide Taoiseach which consisted of a phonetic translation of his broad north Dublin accent. *Brian Cowen had his personal gaffes, misfortunes and bad luck mentioned in Biffo's Briefs, which were a variety of memos, letters and emails from beleaguered government ministers, his predecessor Bertie Ahern (whose letters were often demands for money or snide remarks about Cowen's handling of the government since he took office, composed often in Fagan's pub in Drumcondra) or enquiries from foreign politicians. *Enda Kenny stars in the Wesht Wing in his attempt to keep his Labour Party partners and right wing Fine Gael TDs happy.

Biography Girl, 1950 Stained glass windows, National Library of Israel, Jerusalem Ardon was born Max Bronstein in 1896 in Tuch√≥w, Galicia (then Austria-Hungary, now Poland). In 1933 he emigrated to Jerusalem in Mandate Palestine. He was granted Palestinian citizenship in 1936 and changed his name to Mordecai Ardon. He participated in the Venice Biennale of 1968. Beginning in the 1950s Ardon adopted a complex system of symbolic images in his paintings, taken from the Jewish Mystical tradition (Kabbalah), from the Bible and from a tangible reality. In his painting \\"Gates of Light\\", for example, he expressed \\"the inner mystery and timelessness of the landscape.\\" His work seeks to impart a cosmic dimension to the present, linking it to antiquity and mystery. The same approach can be found in \\"At the Gates of Jerusalem\\" (1967), which shows the attempt to \\"convey his feelings about the cosmic significance of Israel‚Äôs return to the Old City of Jerusalem during the Six-Day War\\".see: At the Gates of Jerusalem\\", Israel Museum, web site. \\"Bird near a yellow wall\\" (1950) demonstrates his simplistic involvement with the Holocaust, a subject to which he was one of the few Israeli artists to devote a phase of his work, at that time. As a teacher and director of the \\"New Bezalel\\", Ardon conveyed his sense of social involvement, his tendency towards Jewish mysticism and local mythology, and the combination of personal national symbols with reality-always stressing masterful technique. Pupils such as Avigdor Arikha, Yehuda Bacon, Naftali Bezem, Shraga Weil and Shmuel Boneh absorbed these influences and integrated them into their later work. Ardon was seen as the father of the regional approach in Israeli art. One of his most famous creations are the \\"Ardon Windows\\" (1980‚Äì1984), a set of large stained-glass windows displayed prominently in the National Library of Israel in Jerusalem, incorporating visual elements from the Kabbalah. Ardon died in Jerusalem in 1992. In 2014 his painting \\"The Awakening\\" (1969) was sold at Sotheby's for $821,000.

The battle marked the end of a three- year series of campaigns by Germanicus in Germania. Background The Germanic chief, Arminius, had been instrumental in the organising of the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, in which three Roman legions, moving west to winter quarters, were ambushed and annihilated by allied Germanic forces in the deep forests of western Germania.Stephen Dando-Collins, Legions of Rome. New York: St. Martin's Press, 2010, p. 238.Dando-Collins 2010, 237. This defeat plagued the Roman psyche and revenge for this defeat, as well as the neutralisation of the threat of Arminius, were the impetus for Germanicus' campaign. In the year before the battle, 15 AD, Germanicus had marched against the Chatti and then against the Cherusci under Arminius. During that campaign, the Romans advanced along the region of the Teutoburg Forest where the legions had been massacred and buried the bones of the Roman soldiers that still lay there.Tacitus, The Annals 1.62 The eagle of the annihilated nineteenth legion was also recovered.Tacitus, The Annals 1.60 Skirmishes with the Germans were constant but the Romans could not draw them into open battle. =Location= Ancient sources identify the location as Idistavisus, but the precise location is unknown, save that it was on the right side of the Weser River,Tacitus, The Annals 2.12 somewhere between the cities of Minden and Hamelin of present-day Germany. The battle The plain of Idistaviso and the battle between Romans and Germans. The Germanic tribes generally avoided open large-scale combat, but by repeated Roman incursions deep into Germanic territory, Germanicus was able to force Arminius, at the head of a large but fractious coalition, into response. The Romans, along with the Chauci who fought on the Roman side as auxiliaries, defeated the allied Germanic forces, inflicting heavy losses on them.Tacitus, The Annals 2.17 Arminius and his uncle Inguiomer were both wounded in the battle but evaded capture. The retreating Germanic army was cut down in every quarter. Many attempting to swim across the Weser died due to a storm of projectiles or by the force of the current. Many others climbed the tops of trees, and while they were hiding themselves in the boughs, the Romans brought archers up to shoot them down. According to Tacitus, \\"[f]rom nine in the morning to nightfall the [Germans] were slaughtered, and ten miles were covered with arms and dead bodies.\\"Tacitus, The Annals 2.18 The Roman soldiers involved on the battlefield hailed Tiberius as Imperator, and raised a pile of arms as a trophy with the names of the defeated tribes inscribed beneath them. Aftermath The sight of the Roman trophy constructed on the battlefield enraged the Germans who were preparing to retreat beyond the Elbe,Tacitus, The Annals 2.19 and they launched an attack on the Roman positions at the Angrivarian Wall, thus beginning a second battle. The Romans had anticipated the attack and again routed the Germans. Germanicus stated that he did not want any prisoners, as the extermination of the Germanic tribes was the only conclusion he saw for the war.Tacitus, The Annals 2.21 The victorious Romans then raised a mound with the inscription: \\"The army of Tiberius Caesar, after thoroughly conquering the tribes between the Rhine and the Elbe, has dedicated this monument to Mars, Jupiter, and Augustus.\\"Tacitus, The Annals 2.22 Afterwards, Germanicus ordered Caius Silius to march against the Chatti with a mixed force of 3,000 cavalry and 33,000 infantry and lay waste of their territory, while he himself, with a larger army, invaded the Marsi for the third time and devastated their land, defeating any foe he encountered.Tacitus, Annals, II.25 Germanicus then withdrew his soldiers behind the Rhine for the winter.Tacitus, The Annals 2.26 According to Tacitus, it was taken as certain that the Germanic tribes were considering suing for peace, and that an additional campaign in the next summer would end the war. However, Tiberius advised Germanicus to return to Rome, writing to him that while \\"[h]e had fought victorious battles on a great scale; he should also remember those losses which the winds and waves had inflicted, and which, though due to no fault of the general, were still grievous and shocking\\" and that \\"since the vengeance of Rome had been satisfied, [the Germans] might be left to their internal feuds.\\" Germanicus was granted a triumph on May 26, AD 17 in exchange for his return from Germania.

They are rhymed, they alliterate and consist of two to four lines per stanza.For a beginner's guide see Dick Ringler, J√≥nas Hallgr√≠msson: Selected Poetry and Prose (University of Wisconsin-Madison), http://www.library.wisc.edu/etext/jonas/, ¬ßIII.2A http://www.library.wisc.edu/etext/jonas/Prosody/Prosody-II.html. The plural, r√≠mur, is either used as an ordinary plural, denoting any two or more r√≠mur, but is also used for more expansive works, containing more than one r√≠ma as a whole. Thus √ìlafs r√≠ma Haraldssonar denotes an epic about √ìlafr Haraldsson in one r√≠ma, while N√∫ma r√≠mur are a multi-part epic on Numa Pompilius. Form R√≠mur, as the name suggests, rhyme, but like older Germanic alliterative verse, they also contain structural alliteration. R√≠mur are stanzaic, and stanzas normally have four lines. There are hundreds of r√≠ma meters: counting variations (Sveinbj√∂rn Beinteinsson provides 450 variations in his H√°ttatal), but they can be grouped in approximately ten families.Bragfr√¶√∞i og H√°ttatal, by Sveinbj√∂rn Beinteinsson The most common metre is ferskeytt.V√©steinn √ìlason, 'Old Icelandic Poetry', in A History of Icelandic Literature, ed. by Daisy Nejmann, Histories of Scandinavian Literature, 5 (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2006), pp. 1-63 (pp. 55-59). R√≠ma-poetry inherited kennings, heiti and other ornate features of medieval Icelandic poetic diction from skaldic verse. The language of r√≠mur is likewise influenced by the rhetorical devices associated with late medieval gebl√ºmter Stil ('flowery style'). When they are long ‚Äî as they usually are ‚Äî r√≠mur usually comprise several distinct sections, each being called a r√≠ma, and each usually in a different metre. After the earliest r√≠mur, it became conventional to begin each r√≠ma in a cycle with a mans√∂ngr, a lyric address, traditionally to or about a woman whom the poet supposedly loves, usually in vain. History The earliest r√≠mur date from the fourteenth century, evolving from eddaic poetry and skaldic poetry with influences from Continental epic poems. √ìl√°fs r√≠ma Haraldssonar, preserved in Flateyjarb√≥k, is the r√≠ma attested in the oldest manuscript and is sometimes considered the oldest r√≠ma; the earliest large collection of r√≠mur is in Kollsb√≥k, dated by √ìlafur Halld√≥rsson to 1480‚Äì90.Kollsb√≥k, √ìlafur Halld√≥rsson ed., Reykjav√≠k: Handritastofnun √çslands, 1968, xxxvj. Sk√≠√∞ar√≠ma, Bjarkar√≠mur, and Lokrur are other examples of early r√≠mur. The key work on editing r√≠mur focused on medieval examples like these and was undertaken by Finnur J√≥nsson.R√≠mnasafn: Samling af de √¶ldste islandske rimer, Finnur J√≥nsson ed. (Samfund til udgivelse af gammel nordisk litteratur, 35), 2 vols, M√∏ller: Copenhagen 1905‚Äì1922; Finnur J√≥nsson, Ordbog til de af Samfund til Udg. ad Gml. Nord. Litteratur Udgivne R√≠mur samt til de af Dr. O. Jiriczek Udgivne B√≥sarimur (Copenhagen, 1926‚Äì28). R√≠mur were usually adapted from existing prose sagas, and occasionally comprise the only surviving evidence for those sagas. One example of such a r√≠mur is the fifteenth-century Sk√°ld-Helga r√≠mur. R√≠mur were the mainstay of epic poetry in Iceland for centuries: 78 are known from before 1600, 138 from the seventeenth century, 248 from the eighteenth, 505 from the nineteenth and 75 from the twentieth.Finnur Sigmundsson, R√≠mnatal (Reykjav√≠k: R√≠mnaf√©lagi√∞, 1966) Most have never been printed and survive only in manuscripts, mostly in the National and University Library of Iceland: about one hundred and thirty popular editions of r√≠mur were printed between 1800 and 1920, but there are more than one thousand nineteenth-century manuscripts containing r√≠mur.Glauser, J√ºrg, \`The End of the Saga: Text, Tradition and Transmission in Nineteenth- and Early Twentieth-Century Iceland', in Northern Antiquity: The Post-Medieval Reception of Edda and Saga, ed. by Andrew Wawn (Enfield Lock: Hisarlik Press, 1994), pp. 101‚Äì41, at p. 125. In the large majority of cases the r√≠mur cycles were composed on a subject about which a written story already existed. As a twist of fate, quite a number of now lost sagas now survive in the form of r√≠mur composed based on them, and then the sagas were recomposed based on the corresponding r√≠mur. The twenty-first century has seen something of a revival of r√≠mur in Icelandic popular music. The central figure in this revival has been Steind√≥r Andersen, particularly noted for collaborations Sigur R√≥s (leading to the 2001 EP R√≠mur) and Hilmar √ñrn Hilmarsson (leading, for example, to the 2013 album Stafnb√∫i). Critical reception In the nineteenth century the poet J√≥nas Hallgr√≠msson published an influential critique on a r√≠mur cycle by Sigur√∞ur Brei√∞fj√∂r√∞ and the genre as a whole.Ironically, although J√≥nas never composed a r√≠ma, he was not above employing the r√≠mnah√¶ttir, as for instance in this shining example of melancholy and self-pity: Enginn gr√¶tur √çslending einan s√©r og d√°inn. √ûegar allt er komi√∞ um kring, kyssir torfa n√°inn. At the same time J√≥nas and other romantic poets were introducing new continental verse forms into Icelandic literature and the popularity of the r√≠mur started to decline. Nevertheless, many of the most popular nineteenth- and twentieth-century Icelandic poets composed r√≠mur, including B√≥lu-Hj√°lmar, Sigur√∞ur Brei√∞fj√∂r√∞, Einar Benediktsson, Steinn Steinarr, √ñrn Arnarson and √û√≥rarinn Eldj√°rn. In the late twentieth century Sveinbj√∂rn Beinteinsson was the best known r√≠mur poet. Steind√≥r Andersen is currently the leading r√≠mur singer in Iceland: he often collaborates with the band Sigur R√≥s and has also contributed to some of Hilmar √ñrn Hilmarsson's works. The scholar Sigur√∞ur Nordal wrote on the r√≠mur.And yet, he himself composed a stanza every now and then, in the r√≠mur metres. Through the ages numerous authors would probably have agreed with this statement, since there is a substantial number of r√≠mur that were turned into prose sagas.Peter A. Jorgensen, The Neglected Genre of R√≠mur-Derived Prose and Post-Reformtion J√≥natas saga, Gripla, VII, (1990), 187-201. However, it is worth mentioning that Nordal never denied the importance of r√≠mur as an aspect of the history of literature, and in his lectures specifically emphasized their role in keeping the continuity of Icelandic literature, a subject close to his heart. He also recognized that among the mass of r√≠mur composed, there were works of art to be found, although he was of the opinion that (according to his published lectures) none of the r√≠mur might be called a \\"perfect work of art\\" with the possible exception of Sk√≠√∞ar√≠ma. But a \\"perfect work of art\\" is somewhat hard to achieve. Editions and resources * W. A. Craigie (ed.), Icelandic Ballads on the Gowrie Conspiracy (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1908).

They were known primarily for their electrical systems and steam turbines. BTH was taken into British ownership and amalgamated with the similar Metropolitan-Vickers company in 1928 to form Associated Electrical Industries (AEI), but the two brand identities were maintained until 1960. The holding company, Associated Electrical Industries (AEI), later merged with GEC. In the 1960s BTH apprenticeships were highly thought-of, with apprentices exposed to production of a wide range of industrial products. Each year in Rugby there was a big parade of floats run by its apprentices, many of whom lodged in the nearby Coton House apprentice hostel. In 1980, G.E.C. Turbine Generators Ltd, on the Rugby site, was awarded a Queen's Awards for Enterprise. History Showing correct company name and format British Thomson-Houston had its origins in Laing, Wharton & Down. One of their steam-driven generators was described in the September 1892 issue of Cassier's Magazine. BTH 120 MW turbo-alternators, installed at Costanera Power Station, Buenos Aires, Argentina The company Laing, Wharton and Down was formed in 1886 to sell products from Thomson- Houston, an American firm known as the American Electric Corporation until 1883. Laing, Wharton and Down soon won a contract for electrical lighting for the east end of London. In 1894 Laing, Wharton and Down purchased patents and exclusive production rights from the American company, now known as General Electric after Thomson-Houston merged with Edison General Electric Company in 1892. At this stage Laing, Wharton and Down was renamed as British Thomson- Houston and General Electric became the majority owner of the company. Once BTH had the production licences for Thomson-Houston's products it started setting up factories in the English Midlands, with Rugby, Warwickshire chosen as the main location due to its good accessibility by rail and a local coal supply. In 1900 BTH bought Glebe Farm on the west side of Mill Road north of the railway in Rugby for ¬£10,000, from Thos. Hunter & Co., to build their factory on it. The Mill Road factory opened in 1902 and made electric motors and generators. In the same year BTH got a licence to produce the Curtis steam turbine, which became one of the company's major products. In 1905 BTH made its first turbo-alternator and in 1911 got licences for all of General Electric's drawn-wire light bulbs, which it produced under the Mazda trademark. For much of the late 19th century BTH competed for electrical generation and distribution contracts with British Westinghouse, mirroring the same company's battles in the US between their parents, General Electric and Westinghouse. The Power Act 1900 let BTH and British Westinghouse get new contracts to supply electric power to large areas. As well as manufacturing, BTH also began to move into transport. On 22 December 1898 BTH opened the Cork Electric Tramways and Lighting Company, followed by the Isle of Thanet Electric Tramways on 4 April 1901 and the Chatham and District Light Railways Company in June 1902. In 1903 BTH was contracted to supply the electrical equipment for the Tyneside Electrics railway network in Newcastle upon Tyne. In 1907 BTH started a joint venture with Wolseley Motors to make petrol- electric buses and in 1909 the company supplied major coal-fired steam generators to London to power an electric trolley system that was being set up. =Consolidation= During World War I BTH expanded into naval electrical equipment, supplying the Royal Navy with various lighting, radio and signalling gear. After the war BTH expanded dramatically, adding or expanding factories at Willesden, Birmingham, Chesterfield, and Lutterworth. It later had factories in Coventry, and in Larne in Northern Ireland. From 1924 to 1927 Demetrius Comino worked as an apprentice for BTH. In 1926 Gerard Swope, president of General Electric, proposed that BTH, Westinghouse, General Electric Company (GEC) and English Electric should amalgamate. Lord Hirst of GEC was not interested in Swope's scheme, but a new holding company was formed, Associated Electrical Industries (AEI), and in 1928 AEI bought BTH and Metropolitan-Vickers (Metrovick). BTH had been in the process of buying Edison Swan (Ediswan) and Ferguson, Pailin & Co, with AEI completing the purchases in 1929. Howard C. Levis, chairman of BTH from 1916, became chairman of AEI in 1928, retiring the following year. In 1927 BTH sold the Chatham and District Light Railways Company to Maidstone and District Motor Services Ltd. Throughout the 1920s BTH made turbo generators and motors for ocean liners including , , and . The BTH factory in Northern Ireland made the turbo generator and propulsion motor for one of the world's first turbo-electric merchant ships, the banana boat SS San Benito, in 1921. This was followed by turbo generators and propulsion motors for the banana boats , and . The site at Rugby was also developed. Building 52, the research laboratory, was purpose-built in 1924. In the late 1920s AEI started to build buildings west of the footpath that runs north through the AEI site in Rugby to the Leicester Road (known in the area as the Black Path because it was surfaced with cinders). During World War II BTH expanded north of the River Avon into the Boughton Road site to make magnetos for aircraft engines and other war products. One of the two British Thomson-Houston distributors (the circular gold-coloured component) on a Rolls-Royce Kestrel aero engine BTH had a major role in developing the world's first prototype jet engine, which was built by Frank Whittle's Power Jets company built at the BTH works in Rugby in 1937. Development was later moved to the Lutterworth works, which were falling into disuse at the time. BTH's directors seemed skeptical of the design and offered little help, and in 1940 decided they were not really interested in making jet engines due to their commitment to electrical equipment. Rover was soon selected to make jet engines, but exchanged jet engine production with Rolls- Royce for making tank engines in 1943. In 1944 the Lutterworth Power Jets work was nationalised. After World War II Oliver Lyttelton took over as chairman of AEI, and started a massive expansion. He returned as chairman between 1954 and 1963 and oversaw the opening of a massive new ¬£8 million turbine works was opened at Larne in 1957. In 1955 AEI acquired Siemens Brothers, which was merged with Edison Swan in 1957 to form the Siemens Edison Swan subsidiary. Rivalry with Metrovick intensified, particularly after BTH won the contract to build the new Buenos Aires Central Costanera S.A. power station, valued at ¬£35 million, in 1957. Lyttelton continued to try to reduce this friction, leading to several unsuccessful reorganisations and slipping profits. The postwar period saw continued development at BTH. The Hungarian scientist Dennis Gabor invented holography at the BTH site in Rugby in 1947, and in 1951 BTH supplied a gas turbine for the Auris, the first commercial ship to use gas-turbine propulsion. In 1955 BTH supplied 18 New Zealand DSC class locomotive Rolls- Royce powered locomotives for New Zealand Railways. The Ediswan trademark appeared on semiconductors in 1956 and the following year British Rail Class 15 diesel-electric locomotives were designed by BTH. =AEI (Associated Electrical Industries)= To try to cure internal political and efficiency problems, AEI stopped using the BTH and Metrovick names on 1 January 1960. This led to a huge decline in sales because no-one had heard of \\"AEI\\" before, and in turn, a massive drop in AEI's stock price. Continued attempts to streamline what was two separate management structures continued to fail, and by the mid-60s the entire AEI group was in financial trouble. The AEI name was first used on products in 1961. By 1967 AEI brands included Siemens Edison Swan, Hotpoint, Birlec and W.T. Henley. Britain's first commercial nuclear power facility was built between 1956 and 1962 at Berkeley. This was followed by the building and commissioning of the 25M Chilbolton (radar) Dish at Chilbolton Observatory between 1963 and 1967. The AEI research lab (building BR57) was built in 1960 at the Boughton Road site. At this point the size of the Rugby site peaked, with all of the company's land west of the Black Path built over. =GEC (General Electric Company)= Rugby of where the east entrance of BTH was In 1967 GEC bought AEI outright and became the UK's largest electrical group. A year later GEC acquired English Electric, prompting a series of mergers and reorganisations. GEC-AEI Electronics (Blackbird Road and New Parks, Leicester) was merged with Marconi's Radar Division (Chelmsford) and Elliott's Aerospace Control Division to form Marconi Radar Systems Ltd. (MRSL) in 1969. In 1980 GEC Turbine Generators Ltd received The Queen's Award for Enterprise: International Trade (Export). During the 1980s GEC Rugby shrank and buildings were demolished. The south part of the area to the west of the Black Path became a supermarket site. The Boughton Road site became several separate small firms. In 1989 GEC Rugby split into GEC Alsthom and Cegelec Projects, which were reunited in 1998 as Alstom. The firm's clubhouse on Hillmorton Road was demolished in 2007, and the south edge of its surrounding sports field was encroached along for house building. By 2011 the site was greatly changed and included Rugby College. Warwickshire University, Rugby College. Retrieved 2013-12-28 Quartzelec, Quartzelec, Rugby.

A public road was built through the site between its former east and west gates. In 2012 Converteam was bought out by General Electric, therefore coming full circle back to when they were partnered in AEI. Converteam (now GE) produced rotating machines and used former-BTH equipment (machines) for running tests. Research During post-World War II Britain, AEI established a consolidated research effort at Aldermaston in Berkshire, England. The research centre was based at Aldermaston Court a large stately home owned by AEI that had been requisitioned for military use in the war era.

Pararetroviruses replicate through reverse transcription just like retroviruses, but the viral particles contain DNA instead of RNA.  Definition Aphid species Myzus persicae Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) is the type species of the family Caulimoviridae. This family is grouped together with Hepadnaviruses into the Pararetrovirus group due to its mode of replication via reverse transcription of a pre-genomic RNA intermediate. CaMV infects mostly plants of the family Brassicaceae (such as cauliflower and turnip) but some CaMV strains (D4 and W260) are also able to infect Solanaceae species of the genera Datura and Nicotiana. CaMV induces a variety of systemic symptoms such as mosaic, necrotic lesions on leaf surfaces, stunted growth, and deformation of the overall plant structure. The symptoms exhibited vary depending on the viral strain, host ecotype, and environmental conditions. CaMV is transmitted in a non-circulatory manner by aphid species such as Myzus persicae. Once introduced within a plant host cell, virions migrate to the nuclear envelope of the plant cell.  Structure  The CaMV particle is an icosahedron with a diameter of 52 nm built from 420 capsid protein (CP) subunits arranged with a triangulation T = 7, which surrounds a solvent-filled central cavity. CaMV contains a circular double-stranded DNA molecule of about 8.0 kilobases, interrupted by nicks that result from the actions of RNAse H during reverse transcription. These nicks come from the Met-tRNA, and two RNA primers used in reverse transcription. After entering the host cell, these single stranded \\"nicks\\" in the viral DNA are repaired, forming a supercoiled molecule that binds to histones. This DNA is transcribed into a full length, Terminally redundant, 35S RNA and a subgenomic 19S RNA.  Genome  The promoter of the 35S RNA is a very strong constitutive promoter responsible for the transcription of the whole CaMV genome. It is well known for its use in plant transformation. It causes high levels of gene expression in dicot plants. However, it is less effective in monocots, especially in cereals. The differences in behavior are probably due to differences in quality and/or quantity of regulatory factors. Recent study has indicated that the CaMV 35S promoter is also functional in some animal cells, although the promoter elements used are different from those in plants. While this promoter had low activity compared to canonical animal promoters, levels of reporter products were significant. This observation suggests that the 35S promoter may have potential for use in animals. The promoter was named CaMV 35S promoter (\\"35S promoter\\") because the coefficient of sedimentation of the viral transcript, whose expression is naturally driven by this promoter, is 35S. It is one of the most widely used, general-purpose constitutive promoters. It was discovered at the beginning of the 1980s, by Chua and collaborators at The Rockefeller University. The 35S RNA is particularly complex, containing a highly structured 600 nucleotide long leader sequence with six to eight short open reading frames (ORFs). This leader is followed by seven tightly arranged, longer ORFs that encode all the viral proteins. The mechanism of expression of these proteins is unique, in that the ORF VI protein (encoded by the 19S RNA) controls translation reinitiation of major open reading frames on the polycistronic 35S RNA, a process that normally only happens on bacterial mRNAs. TAV function depends on its association with polysomes and eukaryotic initiation factor eIF3.

In addition, P6 has been shown to bind to P7; investigating interactions between the two may help to elucidate the as yet unknown function of P7. Another function of P6 involves modification of host NON-EXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS RELATED 1 (NPR1) during the course of infection. NPR1 is an important regulator of salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA)-dependent signaling, and is most closely associated with crosstalk between the two. Modification of NPR1 serves to inhibit plant cells‚Äô defensive responses by preventing SA-dependent signaling; modified NPR1 can properly traffic to the nucleus and bind the PR-1 promoter, but is unable to initiate transcription. Because active NPR1 is required for accumulation of SA, this leads to a further depletion of SA. Whereas regulation of SA- dependent signaling by P6-modified NPR1 is localized to the nucleus, regulation of JA-dependent signaling is cytoplasmic in nature and involves the COI1 pathway. In contrast to that of SA, JA-dependent signaling is increased in the presence of modified NPR1. Replication A diagram depicting the steps in the genome replication of Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (CaMV). DNA is depicted in and RNA (including the tRNA) is depicted in See text for more details. CaMV replicates by reverse transcription: #Viral particles enter a plant cell and are unencapsidated. At this stage the viral DNA consists of three fragments, one on the ‚Äì strand (Œ±) and two on the + strand (Œ≤ and Œ≥) which are imperfectly assembled into a circular genome with three gaps or discontinuities (D1, D2, and D3). #The viral DNA enters the nucleus where the discontinuities are filled in. At this point the viral DNA also associates with host histones, forming a minichromosome (not shown). #The host DNA- dependent RNA polymerase transcribes from the 35S promoter all the way around the viral genome, surpassing the 35S promoter. (This creates two copies of the 35S promoter in the resulting RNA.) Transcription also initiates at the 19S promoter (not shown). #The viral RNAs pass into the host cytoplasm where they are transcribed. #The 3‚Ä≤ end of a tRNAfMet anneals to a site corresponding to discontinuity 1 (D1) near the 5‚Ä≤ end of the 35S RNA. #The tRNAfMet primes synthesis, by the viral reverse transcriptase (encoded by ORF V), of a new Œ± strand. #RNase H removes the RNA from the DNA‚ÄìRNA duplex, leaving behind the DNA. #This new DNA binds the 35S promoter at the 3‚Ä≤ end of the RNA template and synthesis of the Œ± strand of DNA continues and RNase H continues to degrade RNA complexed to DNA. #Synthesis of the Œ± strand completes. RNase H activity exposes purine-rich regions at the position of discontinuity 3 (D3), which primes the synthesis of the Œ≥ DNA strand. #RNase H activity exposes purine-rich regions at the position of discontinuity 2 (D2), which primes the synthesis of the Œ≤ DNA strand. When the new Œ≥ strand of DNA reaches the 5‚Ä≤ end of the new Œ± strand it switches to the 5‚Ä≤ end of the new Œ± strand, recreating discontinuity 1 (D1). When the new Œ≥ strand of DNA reaches the 5‚Ä≤ end of the new Œ≤ strand, it displaces the primer and some of the newly synthesized Œ≤ strand, resulting in the recreation of discontinuity 2 (D2). When the new Œ≤ strand of DNA reaches the 5‚Ä≤ end of the new Œ≥ strand, it displaces the primer and some of the newly synthesized Œ≥ strand, resulting in the recreation of discontinuity 3 (D3). At this point the new viral genome can either be packaged into capsids and released from the cell or they can be transported by movement proteins into an adjacent, uninfected cell. The cauliflower mosaic virus promoter (CaMV 35S) is used in most transgenic crops to activate foreign genes which have been artificially inserted into the host plant. It is inserted into transgenic plants in a form which is different from that found when it is present in its natural Brassica plant hosts. This enables it to operate in a wide range of host-organism environments which would otherwise not be possible. CaMV contains about 8 kb double-strand DNA genome and produces spherical particles. CaMV infections are systemic, and even its DNA is infectious when inoculated on abraded plant surfaces. The CaMV genome has 8 tightly packed genes, of which only two small genes, genes II and VII, are nonessential; as a result, only these two genes can be replaced/deleted without a loss of infectivity. In addition, modified CaMV genomes exceeding the natural genome size (8024 bp) by even a few hundred bp are not packaged into virions. These two factors seriously limit the size of DNA insert clonable in CaMV. The bacterial dihydrofolate reductase DHFR gene has been successfully cloned into the CaMV genome, in place of gene II, and has been successfully expressed in plants.  Molecular mechanisms of vector-mediated CaMV transmission The virus is acquired from an infected host during feeding by the aphid vector. To occur, a transmissible complex is composed of virions and protein P2 located in the vector's stylets. The P2 N-terminal domain recognizes a protein receptor located at the tip of the stylet and the P2 C-terminal domain binds to the P3-decorated virions. Transmissible complex of CaMV The mode of acquisition by the vector is controlled by the tissue and intracellular-specific localization of P2. This protein is only found in epidermis and parenchyma cells. Moreover, in these cells, P2 is localized in single viral electron-lucent inclusion bodies (ELIB). In host cells, viral protein P2 and P3 are first produced in numerous viral factories (electron- dense inclusion bodies), and are later exported and co-localize with microtubules, before concentrating in ELIB. CaMV specifically uses the microtubules to form the transmissible body and thus enable vector transmission. The complete molecular characterization and study of this virus was not carried further. Evasion of plant defenses Cauliflower mosaic virus possesses a number of mechanisms that allow it to counteract host plant cell defenses. While the pregenomic 35S RNA is responsible for genome replication by reverse transcriptase, it also contains a non-coding 600 base pair leader sequence that serves as an important mRNA for the production of factors involved in viral counter-defense. A number of hosts of CaMV possess small RNA-based viral silencing mechanisms that serve to limit viral infection. The products of the aforementioned 600-bp sequence are viral small RNAs (vsRNA) of 21, 22, and 24 nucleotides in length that serve as decoys, binding and inactivating effectors of host silencing machinery, such as Argonaute 1 (AGO1). As proof-of-principle, experimental overexpression of these vsRNAs allows for increased viral accumulation in infected plants. Concerns about use of CaMV 35S promoter in transgenic plants Recently, some concerns have been raised about using the CaMV 35S promoter for expression in transgenic plants because sequence overlap exists between this promoter and the coding sequences of P6. Fifty four transgenic events certified for release in the USA contain up to 528 bp of ORF VI (encoding C-terminal domains of P6). As P6 is a multifunctional protein whose full range of functions is unknown, there is some concern that expression of one or more of its domains may have unforeseen consequences in the transgenic organisms. Recent studies have attempted to determine what length of CaMV 35S promoter has the least chance of inadvertently producing P6 domains, while still retaining full promoter activity. As one might expect, using shorter promoter lengths decreases the number of P6 domains included and also decreases the likelihood of unwanted effects.

The station's original slogan The Quality Station was taken seriously by management, who tried to produce programs which they often perceived as being superior to similar programs being produced by rival stations. 3XY was the last commercial radio station to come on air in Melbourne until 3MP began broadcasting in 1976, 41 years later. By the time 3XY began broadcasting in 1935, most listeners had established their broadcasting patterns and they often continued to listen to 3XY's rivals, which is usually seen as the reason why 3XY was very low in the ratings for some decades.Australian Broadcasting Control Board, Annual Reports. In the collection of Albert Isaacs, Melbourne.Jones, Colin, Something in the Air: A History of Radio in Australia, Kangaroo Press, 1995. Despite generally low ratings, there were a few popular programs, including the children's session sponsored by Peters Ice Cream, One Man's Family, Raising a Husband, etc. The station also produced some top class live variety programs with artists of the calibre of Stella Lamond; Doug McKenzie; Helen Reddy, Max Reddy, Leslie Ross, etc.collection of published radio guides, in the collection of Albert Isaacs, MelbourneStella Lamond and Max Reddy were the parents of Toni Lamond Frank Thring Jr. started his career as both a thespian and radio announcer at 3XY in 1941, as a young man of 15. His numerous jobs at the 3XY microphone included being Uncle Frankie in the children's session. Thring's acting career, whilst mainly centred around the Melbourne theatre scene, also included periods in London and Hollywood. Because of the lack of listeners, 3XY did not get as much advertising revenue as some of its rivals, but this was, in part, compensated for by the broadcasting of many sponsored religious programs, particularly on Sunday afternoons, as well as sponsored non-English programs, mainly Italian. At the time, 3XY had to comply with an Australian Broadcasting Control Board regulation that required anything broadcast in any foreign language to also be translated into English. Geelong footballer Wallace Sharland was also a pioneer radio football commentator at the ABC and later at 3XY. This photo was taken at the microphone during a broadcast. By his hand gestures, it appears to be an exciting moment of the game. On the other hand, could he just be posing for the camera? Note the fence behind Sharland, which shows that broadcasters then had to broadcast from the outer of the ground, with no apparent privileges. From the commencement of the 1936 Australian rules football season (about seven months after 3XY had first come on air) it became the very first station to broadcast descriptions of Victorian Football Association games. 3XY later broadcast games of the Victorian Football League. They also broadcast descriptions of Melbourne thoroughbred horse races each Saturday, as well as transmitting some interstate races. On some weeknights, harness races, then known as the trots, were broadcast. Prior to 1967, the station had many prominent announcers, as well as a number of broadcasters who would go on to achieve fame at other stations. These included Frank Avis, Laurie Bennett, Graham Berry, Carl Bleazby, John Boland, John Burls, Ray Chapman, Peter Charleston, Bern Davis, Col Denovan, Jack Dyer, Keith Eden, Doug Elliot, Peter Evans, Vi Greenhalf, Mary Hardy, Ken Hibbins, Geoff Hiscock, Ken Howard, Tom Jones, Craig Kelly, Maurie Kirby, Wayne Kirby, Paul Konik, Alwyn Kurts, Ray Lawrence, Barry Looms, Bernice (Binny) Lum, Alex McNish, Bruce Mansfield, John Magee, Ian Major, Tom Miller, Alf Minister, Bert Newton, Bill Passick, Sir Eric Pearce, Stan Rofe, Bob Rogers, Will Sampson, Barry Seeber, Wallace Sharland, David Shoreland, Paul Sime, Clyde Simpson, Eric (Tiny) Snell, Roy Stenye, Cyril Stokes, John Storr, Jeff Sunderland, Madge Thomas, Frank Thring Jr., Hal Todd, Iven Walker, Mike Walsh, Jeff Warden, Dorothy Wilby, Madge Wister, Johnny Young, etc. Between 1954 and 1962, 3XY was Victoria's only 24-hour broadcaster. (In the 1930s, the Postmaster-General's Department issued 24-hour licences to one station in each capital city market except Melbourne. In Melbourne, since 1931, 3AK had been broadcasting almost exclusively in the early-morning hours when other stations were off the air. However, on 1 February 1954, 3AK began broadcasting exclusively during hours of daylight, and concurrently 3DB, 3UZ and 3XY were all given 24-hour licences, but both 3DB and 3UZ had ceased all- night broadcasting within six months. Nevertheless, between 1962 and 1968, the Australian Broadcasting Control Board had granted 24-hour licences to all Melbourne commercial stations; 24-hour transmission on ABC stations was to follow within a few years.) An excellent history of the first 10 years or so of 3XY can be accessed in the following book: Fitzpatrick, Peter, The Two Frank Thrings, 2012, Monash University Publishing, Clayton, Victoria. An online review of The Two Frank Thrings can be accessed at https://publishing.monash.edu/books/thrings.html. 1967‚Äì1989 From 1 July 1967, under the direction of General Manager Bob Baeck the station became Melbourne's dominant music radio station and remained so until the early 1980s, with a Top 40 music radio format, which often topped the ratings. Its sister station during this era was Sydney's 2SM. Of the many promotions conducted by the station, the most important during the 1970s/80s was Rocktober held annually during the month of October. 3XY dropped all of its religious programming in the late 1960s under the direction of Program Manager Dick Heming. (Heming received a letter of complaint from a woman who signed herself 'Yours in Christianity' but which concluded: 'I have prayed to the Lord that you be struck dead'.)Griffen-Foley, Bridget, Changing Stations: The Story of Australian Commercial Radio, UNSW Press, 2009, Sydney In the early 1970s, there was a head-on battle for the lucrative Top 40 market between 3XY, by then managed by Rod Muir, and Rhett Walker's 3AK. The fact that 3XY won the battle is reflected in 3AK's rapid change away from its Top 40 format. However, 3XY's fortunes declined in the late 1980s after the advent of FM radio in Australia, a few years' earlier.bhttp://www.ronrude.com/pages/the_play.htmm=isch&tbo;=u&source;=univ&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwjAydjal_XSAhUPT48KHSGvAxUQsAQIKQ&biw;=1366&bih;=548&dpr;=1#spf=1 3XY DJs during this era included: Barry Bissell, Hans Christian, Jack Daniels, Greg Evans, Peter Grace, Peter Harrison, Jane Holmes, John Hood, Craig Huggins, Kevin Hillier, Mark Irvine, Peter James, Chris Maxwell, Peter O'Callaghan, John O'Donnell, John Peters, Stan Rofe, Lee Simon, Peter Grubby Stubbs, Richard Stubbs, Gary Suprain, Paul Turner, Karl van Est. As well as its Top 40 format, in the early 1970s, 3XY also experimented with a personality format with Bert Newton conducting the breakfast program, and Graham Kennedy presenting a morning session from a studio especially constructed at a cost of $10,000 in the bedroom of his house in Frankston, thus saving him from even having to leave home to present the show. He often broadcast whilst in pyjamas. During the late 1970s Derryn Hinch presented a current affairs morning program. The Liberal Party continued to have a marked influence at 3XY. In the late 1970s and 80s, the manager of the station was Stanley Guilfoyle, husband of Liberal Senator Margaret Guilfoyle. Magnus Cormack, a former Liberal senator, served as chairman of the company after his retirement from politics in 1978. The company's articles of association provided that, upon the sale of the company, any proceeds should be \\"given or transferred to some institution or institutions having objects similar to the objects of the company\\". In 1986, the radio licence was sold to businessman Paul Dainty for $15 million. The proceeds were used to establish the Cormack Foundation, which became a major donor to the Victorian Liberals. 1989‚Äì1991 After losing the ratings and financial battle with FM rivals 3EON and 3FOX, the 3XY licence was bought in late 1989 by the parent company of BAY-FM, a Geelong based station which was then just about to come on air. When BAY-FM commenced broadcasting in December 1989, 3XY briefly simulcast the BAY-FM overnight programs, retaining its rock music format during the day. However, once new studios in Corio Bay were completed, Bay FM and 3XY began full-time simulcasting, 3XY breaking only for coverage of Australian Football League (AFL) games, which they were contracted to cover. After a period of 12 months, the then-Australian Broadcasting Authority demanded that the two stations begin separate programming. While the two stations remained in their Corio studios, Bay FM relaunched with an easy listening format, with 3XY retaining its soft rock format. In 1991, 3XY was sold to AWA Limited, owners of 2CH Sydney and other stations, who almost immediately shut the station down and re-opened it seven months later as 3EE. 3XY's transmitter was turned off at 1.00 pm on 23 September 1991. The final on-air program as 3XY was a one- hour pre-recorded special, commissioned by AWA and produced and presented by music historian Glenn A. Baker. It was a tribute showcasing the music of 1976 when 3XY was number one in the radio ratings. Roxanne Bennett was the last 'live' announcer on 3XY, finishing her shift at 12 noon that day with Spectrum's song I'll Be Gone the final song played before the one hour pre- recorded special was aired. The last song to be ever aired on 3XY, was AC/DC's It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll), at the end of the pre-recorded special. AWA formally applied for a change of callsign from 3XY to 3EE and a change of frequency from 1422 kHz to 693 kHz. Both requests were granted by the Australian Broadcasting Authority. Although it was a relaunch of the 3XY licence that had existed since 1935 and not the issuing of a new licence, AWA chose to promote the forthcoming 3EE as a \\"completely new\\" station. (A new licence for the 1422 kHz frequency was purchased at auction in 1994 by the Greek Media Group. Initially the licence was for a specified period of three years, and was then to be subject to a five yearly auction cycle. This rule was removed, and the station was effectively permitted to continue on a permanent basis. The new stationhttps://radioau.net/3xy-hellas/ adopted the 3XY call-sign. It is a narrowcast Greek language commercial station, with no connection to the station of 1935‚Äì91.) =1992-1993: 3EE= The \\"new\\" station 3EE began official transmission at 7.00am Friday 2 July 1992. Promoted as The Breeze, the station had a mix of easy listening music, personality talk and Saturday AFL football. Some programs garnered a loyal following but overall the station failed to gain a commercially viable audience in its target demographic of people aged 40+. AWA had a three-year strategy to grow the 3EE audience, but in 1993 the company decided to exit the commercial broadcasting sector and concentrate on its core business of electronics design and manufacture. AWA sold 3EE to Wesgo Communications, owner of another Melbourne station, 3MP, based in Frankston, an outer south- eastern suburb. A few months later in 1994, AWA sold 3EE's sister station in Sydney 2CH, bringing to an end AWA's 70 years in radio broadcasting. =1993‚Äì2017: Magic 693/1278= 3MP and 3EE simulcast their programs until the ABA ordered that they cease the practice and recommence two separate formats. As from December 1993, 3EE used the marketing name of Magic 693, whilst retaining its official call-sign 3EE. It had a 1940s, 1950s and 1960s music format, while 3MP maintained its more mainstream easy listening format on 1377. Media operator Southern Cross Broadcasting, which also owned Melbourne radio stations 3AK and 3AW, bought the 3MP and 3EE licences, and in accordance with media ownership laws which restrict any organisation from owning more than two radio stations in one region, they chose to keep 3AW and 3EE (Magic 693), while selling off the lower-rating 3AK and 3MP licences. From 1 May 2006, Magic 693 became Magic 1278 after switching frequencies with 3AW. On 13 April 2015, the station's entire on air line-up, and most of the programming and production team, was made redundant, as the result of the merger of Fairfax Media's radio assets and the Macquarie Radio Network. Immediately, a new music format was introduced that focused on the classic hits of the 1960s and 1970s. In November 2015, it was announced that the station would begin networking programming into Brisbane on sister station Magic 882. The last song to be played on Magic 1278 was Thank You for the Music by ABBA. =2017-2018: Talking Lifestyle= On Monday 27 February 2017, Macquarie Radio Network relaunched 3EE as Talking Lifestyle. The launch of Talking Lifestyle into the Melbourne and Brisbane market followed 18 months of development by Macquarie Media and a soft launch in the Sydney market in September 2016 through 2UE. The Brisbane outlet was Talking Lifestyle 882. Presenters for the station broadcast from either Sydney or Melbourne. The on-air line-up included Ed Phillips, Catriona Rowntree, Nick Bennett, Dee Dee Dunleavy and Sabina Read. =2018-2020: Macquarie Sports Radio= Magic 1278 (3EE) currently has studios in The Age building on the corner of Spencer & Collins Streets On Wednesday 4 April 2018, the three Talking Lifestyle branded stations relaunched with a new sports radio format under the name Macquarie Sports Radio with coverage of the 2018 Commonwealth Games. 1278 takes all Melbourne Storm matches as well as a selection of interstate NRL matches broadcast by the Continuous Call Team 2020: Magic 1278 (second incarnation) On 21 January 2020, Nine Entertainment announced the Macquarie Sports Radio brand would be abandoned and the station ‚Äì along with its interstate sister stations 2UE and 4BH ‚Äì would return to an all-music format \\"built around the best of the '70s, '80s and '90s\\" with a \\"soft launch\\" on 2 February 2020.

Youth Bretislav was the son of Duke Old≈ôich and his low-born concubine Bo≈æena. As an illegitimate son could not obtain a desirable wife by conventional means, he chose to kidnap his future wife Judith of Schweinfurt (), a daughter of the Bavarian noble Henry of Schweinfurt, Margrave of Nordgau, in 1019 at Schweinfurt. During his father‚Äôs reign, in 1019 or 1029, Bretislav took back Moravia from Poland. About 1031, he invaded Hungary in order to prevent its expansion under king Stephen. The partition of Bohemia between Old≈ôich and his brother Jarom√≠r in 1034 was probably the reason why Bretislav fled beyond the Bohemian border, only to come back to take the throne after Jarom√≠r‚Äôs abdication. Raid into Poland In 1035, Bretislav helped Holy Roman Emperor Conrad II in his war against the Lusatians. In 1039, he invaded Lesser and Greater Poland, captured Pozna≈Ñ, sacked Gniezno, and brought the relics of St. Adalbert, Radim Gaudentius and the Five Brothers back with him. On the way back, he regained part of Silesia, (several dozen years before conquered by Poles), including Wroc≈Çaw. His main goal was to set up an archbishopric in Prague and create a large state subject only to the Holy Roman Empire. His raid had an unintended enduring influence on Polish history, as the plundering and destruction of Gniezno pushed the next Polish rulers to move their capital to Krak√≥w, which would retain this role for many centuries ahead. In 1040, the German King Henry III invaded Bohemia, but was forced to retreat after he lost the Battle at Br≈Ødek (a pass in the Bohemian Forest). The following year, Henry III invaded again, skirted the border defences and laid siege to Bretislav in Prague. Forced by a mutiny among his nobles and betrayed by Bishop ≈†eb√≠≈ô of Prague, Bretislav had to renounce all of his conquests save for Moravia and recognize Henry III as his sovereign. 1042 Emperor Henry III granted Bretislav Silesia as lien. In 1047, Emperor Henry III negotiated a peace treaty between Bretislav and the Poles. This pact worked in Bretislav's favour, as the Polish ruler swore never again to attack Bohemia in return for an annual subsidy to Gniezno. Domestic policy Bretislav was the author of decrees concerning the rules of Christianization, which included a ban on polygamy and trade on holidays. It was in 1030 that Bretislav married the afore-mentioned Judith. In 1054, he established rules for the ducal succession and introduced agnatic seniority as the law of succession. Younger members of the dynasty were supposed to govern fiefs (technically, parts of Moravia), but only at the duke's discretion. The result of this succession policy was the relative indivisibility of the Czech lands, but also bitter conflicts over succession and territorial primacy between members of the dynasty. It was effectively ended by the elevation of Bohemia to the status of a kingdom under Ottokar I of Bohemia, which led to the establishment of primogeniture as the ruling principle for succession rights. Bretislav's eldest son Spytihnƒõv was to succeed him as Duke of Bohemia with control over it domains. Moravia was incorporated into the Bohemian duchy, but divided between three of his younger sons. The Olomouc Appanage went to Vratislaus; the Znojmo Appanage went to Konr√°d; and the Brno Appanage went to Otto. The youngest son, Jarom√≠r, entered the church and became Bishop of Prague. Bretislav died at Chrudim in 1055 during preparations for another invasion of Hungary and was succeeded by his son Spytihnƒõv II as Duke of Bohemia. His sons Otto and Vratislav were shut out of the government by Spytihnƒõv, but after his death both gained control of Moravia and Bohemia, respectively. Family Bretislav kidnapping his future wife Judith of Schweinfurt from a monastery, from the Chronicle of Dalimil. Bretislav married Judith, the daughter of Margrave Henry of Schweinfurt. The House of P≈ôemysl wished to confirm its good relationship with the Babenbergs through a marriage to Judith in 1020. Judith was a desirable bride, but Old≈ôich of Bohemia had only one son, Bretislav, and he was of illegitimate birth, thus complicating the prospect of a marriage with the high-born Judith. Bretislav solved the problem by kidnapping Judith from a monastery in Schweinfurt. He was never punished for this crime, and he married Judith some time later. Their first son Spytihnƒõv was born after almost ten years, which led to the hypothesis that the kidnapping happened in 1029, although Judith may have given birth to daughters before her first son. In all, there were five sons from the marriage that survived into adulthood: *Spytihnƒõv II, Duke of Bohemia *Vratislaus II of Bohemia *Conrad I, Duke of Bohemia *Otto I of Olomouc *Jarom√≠r, Bishop of Prague Legacy Bretislav I was buried in the old St. Vitus Church in Prague, founded by Wenceslaus I in 930, and his tomb is now situated in the Chapel of St. Wenceslaus in the St. Vitus Cathedral built in the 1344‚Äì66 period. Bretislav I was depicted in the fresco composition of the P≈ôemyslid dynasty at the Znojmo Rotunda, painted in the 1134‚Äì61 period.

Revanchism (, from revanche, \\"revenge\\") is the political manifestation of the will to reverse territorial losses incurred by a country, often following a war or social movement. As a term, revanchism originated in 1870s France in the aftermath of the Franco-Prussian War among nationalists who wanted to avenge the French defeat and reclaim the lost territories of Alsace- Lorraine. Revanchism draws its strength from patriotic and retributionist thought and is often motivated by economic or geopolitical factors. Extreme revanchist ideologues often represent a hawkish stance, suggesting that their desired objectives can be achieved through the positive outcome of another war. It is linked with irredentism, the conception that a part of the cultural and ethnic nation remains \\"unredeemed\\" outside the borders of its appropriate nation-state.Margaret Macmillan, The War That Ended Peace: The Road to 1914 (2013) ch 6 Revanchist politics often rely on the identification of a nation with a nation state, often mobilizing deep-rooted sentiments of ethnic nationalism, claiming territories outside the state where members of the ethnic group live, while using heavy-handed nationalism to mobilize support for these aims. Revanchist justifications are often presented as based on ancient or even autochthonous occupation of a territory since \\"time immemorial\\", an assertion that is usually inextricably involved in revanchism and irredentism and justifies them in the eyes of their proponents. History =France= The instance of revanchism that gave these groundswells of opinion their modern name came in the 1870s. French revanchism was a deep sense of bitterness, hatred and demand for revenge against Germany, especially because of the loss of Alsace and Lorraine following defeat in the Franco-Prussian War.Karine Varley, \\"The Taboos of Defeat: Unmentionable Memories of the Franco-Prussian War in France, 1870‚Äì1914.\\" in Jenny Macleod, ed., Defeat and Memory: Cultural Histories of Military Defeat in the Modern Era (Palgrave Macmillan, 2008) pp. 62‚Äì80.Karine Varley, Under the Shadow of Defeat: The War of 1870‚Äì71 in French Memory (2008) Paintings that emphasized the humiliation of the defeat came in high demand, such as those by Alphonse- Marie-Adolphe de Neuville. Mirabeau was saying that War is the National Industry of Prussia.\\" Georges Clemenceau, of the Radical Republicans, opposed participation in the scramble for Africa and other adventures that would divert the Republic from objectives related to the \\"blue line of the Vosges\\" in Alsace-Lorraine. After the governments of Jules Ferry had pursued a number of colonies in the early 1880s, Clemenceau lent his support to Georges Ernest Boulanger, a popular figure, nicknamed G√©n√©ral Revanche, who it was felt might overthrow the Republic in 1889. This ultranationalist tradition influenced French politics up to 1921 and was one of the major reasons France went to great pains to woo the Russian Empire, resulting in the Franco-Russian Alliance of 1894 and, after more accords, the Triple Entente of the three great Allied powers of World War I: France, Great Britain, and Russia.See W. Schivelbusch, The Culture of Defeat, p. 106 (Henry Holt and Co. 2001) French revanchism influenced the Treaty of Versailles of 1919 following the end of World War I, which restored Alsace-Lorraine to France and extracted reparations from the defeated Germany. The conference was not only opened on the anniversary of the proclamation of the \\"Second Reich\\", the treaty also had to be signed by the new German government in the same room, the Hall of Mirrors. =Germany= A German revanchist movement developed in response to the losses of World War I. Pan-Germanists within the Weimar Republic called for the reclamation of the property of a German state due to pre-war borders or because of the territory's historical relation to Germanic peoples. The movement called for the reincorporation of Alsace-Lorraine, the Polish Corridor and the Sudetenland (see Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia--parts of the Austrian Empire and Austria-Hungary until its dismemberment after World War I). Those claims, supported by Adolf Hitler, led to World War II, with the invasion of Poland. This irredentism had also been characteristic of the V√∂lkisch movement in general and of the Pan-German League (Alldeutscher Verband). The Verband wanted to uphold German 'racial hygiene' and were against breeding with in their eyes inferior races like the Jews and Slavs.Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution, Volume 1. Richard S. Levy, 528‚Äì529, ABC-CLIO 2005 =Lithuania= Ethnographic Lithuania was an early 20th-century concept that defined Lithuanian territories as a significant part of the territories that belonged to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Lithuanians as all people living on them, regardless of whether those people spoke Lithuanian or and considered themselves Lithuanian. The concept was in contrast to those of \\"historic Lithuania\\", the territories of the Duchy, and the \\"linguistic Lithuania\\", the area in which Lithuanian language was overwhelmingly spoken. The concept of ethnographic Lithuania clashed with the right for self-determination of people living in that large territory, particularly Poles and Belarusians, who, according to the supporters of the ethnographic Lithuania, were \\"Slavicized Lithuanians\\" who needed to be re-Lithuanized. They argued that individuals cannot decide on his ethnicity and nationality and that it is related to not their language but their ancestry. =Poland= In the 1920s and 1930s, Poland was trying to reclaim ethnic Polish lands that had been occupied by German, Russian and Austro-Hungarian empires: =Sweden= Sweden lost Finland to Russia at the conclusion of the Finnish War (1808-09), ending nearly 600 years of Swedish rule. For most of the rest of the 1800s there was talk, but few practical plans and little political will, of reclaiming Finland from Russia. Since Sweden was never able to challenge Russia's military might on its own, no attempts were made. During the Crimean War in 1853 to 1856, the Allied nations initiated talks with Sweden to allow troop and fleet movements through Swedish ports to be used against Russia. In return, the Allies would help Sweden reclaim Finland with the help of an expeditionary force. In the end, the plans fell through and Sweden never became involved in the fighting. =Hungary= The Treaty of Trianon: Kingdom of Hungary lost 72% of its land and 3.3 million people of Hungarian ethnicity. The idea of Greater Hungary is associated with Hungarian revisionism, targeting at least to regain control over Hungarian-populated areas in Hungary's neighbouring countries. The outcome of the Treaty of Trianon of 1920 is to this day remembered in Hungary as the Trianon trauma. According to a study, two-thirds of Hungarians agreed in 2020 that parts of neighbouring countries should belong to them. =Mexico= Some Mexican nationalists consider the Southwestern United States to be Mexican territory that must be returned. The territory belonged to Mexico until being ceded to the United States in the Texas annexation (1845) and the Mexican Cession (1848), as a consequence of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. =Russia= The annexation of the Crimean peninsula by the Russian Federation in April 2014, together with accusations by Western and Ukrainian leaders that Russia is supporting separatist actions by ethnic Russians in the secessionist Donbass region, has been cited by a number of prominent media outlets in the West as evidence of a revanchist policy on the part of the Kremlin and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some Russian nationalists consider Alaska to be Russian territory that must be returned. Alaska was legally sold to the US by Russia in 1867. =Argentina= Argentina considers the British-controlled Falkland Islands to be part of the Tierra del Fuego Province. In 1994, Argentina's claim to the territories was added to its constitution. =Spain= Spain ceded Gibraltar to Britain under the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713. Spain's claim to Gibraltar became government policy under the regime of the dictator Francisco Franco and has remained in place under successive governments following the Spanish transition to democracy.

Matthias Bernard Braun was born as the fifth child of Jacob Braun and Magdalene born Neureuter. He apprenticed in Austria (Salzburg) and Italy (Venice, Bologna, Rome). And in his work, it is the Italian influence, that is the most prominent. He was inspired by Michelangelo Buonarroti, Gian Lorenzo Bernini and by the Venetian sculptural school of the 17th century and thus became a great propagator of the Italian-provenience sculpture in the Central-European context. Some time before 1710, Braun came to visit Prague, already as a full-fledged artist creating from sandstone, and soon he became domestic in Bohemia. He found his wife and friends there, and became a citizen to the New Town of Prague. Already his first work - the statuary of the Vision of St. Luthgard (Czech: Vidƒõn√≠ sv. Luitgardy) from 1710, situated on Charles Bridge in Prague - brought to him much attention and many new orders. Braun then was able to found the biggest workshop in Prague, employing six journeymen and having an income of 900 golden a year around 1725. Soon, he himself could not manage the number of new commissions for Prague palaces, gardens, churches and many other places in Bohemia, a situation worsened by the progressing tuberculosis. That is why he only created the designs and models, had his cooperators realize them and completed the work into the final appearance. He had five children, none of which continued his work, though. He died in Prague in 1738. Matthias Braun is probably the most famous for his collection of the allegories of Virtues and Vices situated at the Kuks Hospital in Bohemia, a commission of count Franti≈°ek Anton√≠n ≈†pork. Other notable sculptures include: the Bethlehem - monumental statues chiselled directly in sandstone rocks near Kuks, forty pitoresque statues of dwarfs at the Kuks race-course, several statuaries at Charles Bridge in Prague, statues in the St. Kliment's church (Prague), the stone pillar of the Holy Trinity in Teplice, the sculptures in the interior of Czernin palace (Prague), and many others. There is an asteroid named Mathiasbraun (number 6768), discovered in 1983.

They were designed as a direct follow-on from the Porpoise class: physical dimensions were the same, but stronger materials were used in hull construction, and updated equipment was fitted. The submarines were built between 1957 and 1978 by four shipyards: Cammell Laird (4), Chatham Dockyard (6), Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company (11) and Vickers-Armstrongs (6). Thirteen of the submarines were operated by the Royal Navy, six by the Royal Australian Navy, three by the Brazilian Navy, three by the Royal Canadian Navy/Canadian Forces Maritime Command (plus two ex-Royal Navy boats later acquired for non-commissioned roles), and two by the Chilean Navy. The Oberons operated during the height of the Cold War, with duties including surveillance, tracking of other ships and submarines, delivery and retrieval of special forces personnel, and serving as targets for anti-submarine training. Submarines of the class were in service until 2000. As of 2015, eight of the submarines are preserved intact as museum vessels, another three are partially preserved (with some exterior portions of the submarine on display), and one is in private ownership and awaiting conversion for display. The rest have been sold for scrap, including one former museum vessel. Design and construction The -long Oberon class was based heavily on the preceding Porpoise class of submarines, which were in service from 1956 to 1988. Changes from the Porpoise design were primarily to improve the strength and stealth of the submarine. Instead of UXW steel, the hull was built from QT28 steel, which was easier to fabricate and stronger, allowing the submarine to dive deeper.Brown & Moore, Rebuilding the Royal Navy, p. 116 Glass-reinforced plastic was used in construction of the casing. The fin and equipment masts of Electronics, sonar, and radar systems were also upgraded to the latest standard. The submarines were equipped with a type 1002 surface search and navigation radar, a type 187 active-passive attack sonar, and a type 2007 long-range passive sonar. The Oberons were constructed at a variety of shipyards in the United Kingdom: the six Australian and two Chilean submarines by Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company (the latter were built after the Scott Lithgow merger); the three Brazilian submarines by Vickers-Armstrongs; and the three Canadian submarines at Chatham Dockyard. Construction of the British submarines was shared amongst four dockyards: the three mentioned above and Cammell Laird. =Armament= Barr and Stroud Attack Periscope Type CH74 ‚Äì RAN Oberon class submarine Torpedo fire control consoles aboard HMCS Onondaga The Oberons were originally armed with eight torpedo tubes: six tubes in the bow, and two short tubes for antisubmarine defence in the stern. The submarine normally carried a payload of 20 torpedoes for the forward tubes; a mix of Mark 24 Tigerfish and Mark 8 torpedoes, while only the two preloaded Mark 20S torpedoes were carried for the stern tubes. Naval mines could be carried instead of torpedoes: the torpedo payload would be replaced with up to 50 Mark 5 Stonefish or Mark 6 Sea Urchin mines. The forward torpedo tubes are constructed in two sections bolted together across the bulkhead at the fore end of the torpedo compartment. The long inner section is constructed of rolled steel fitted with welded flanges and support brackets. The outer section is constructed of a similar tube long but with a reinforced thick section behind the main bulkhead. The internal door hinges at one side with two locking mechanisms, a swing bolt opposite the hinge and a rotating locking ring attached to the tube which presses down on the ten projecting lugs around the door. The outer end of the tube is sealed with a domed bow cap. Bow shutters close across the bow caps so as to preserve the streamlined shape of the bow when the cap is closed. Forward torpedo tubes on The bow caps and shutters are mechanically linked to a hydraulically operated drive rod from within the torpedo compartment. The bow cap opens first behind the shutter, which then folds back against it forming a smooth exit tube. Interlocks prevent the doors at both ends being opened at the same time but the inner door is also provided with a test cock to check whether the tube is full of water before opening and remains held nearly closed by the swing bolt after the locking ring is released. The tube internal diameter is 22.5 in, wider than the torpedo, which is designed as a loose fit inside the tube. Torpedoes could be fired either electrically or with compressed air. The aft torpedo tubes passed through the ballast tank at the rear of the submarine. A section projected into the boat through the bulkhead, forming overall a relatively short tube of , but of diameter. With the retirement of the Mark 20S torpedo in the 1980s, the stern torpedo tubes were decommissioned and thereafter used for storing beer. =Propulsion systems= The class used diesel-electric propulsion, with lead-acid batteries to provide power when the engines cannot be used. Each vessel has two Admiralty-pattern V-16 diesel engines (ASR1 16VMS), each driving one 1280-kW 880-V generator. These can provide power directly to the two electric motors, one directly connected to each propeller, or for charging batteries. The diesel engines can only be operated with external ventilation, but this can be obtained either while on the surface or when shallowly submerged by use of two snorkels which can be raised from the fin. One snorkel brings in new air to the boat, while the other takes exhaust fumes from the engines. The ventilation system is designed so the fresh air spreads through the boat. Engine compartment on , twin V16 diesel engines The generators are cooled by an internal fan on the shaft which circulates air through a filter and water-cooled heat exchanger within the casing. A grill allows pressure equalisation inside and out. The generator has one pedestal bearing fed with oil from the diesel engine lubrication supply and is fitted with an internal heater to prevent condensation when not running. The submarine has two batteries, each comprising 224 2V cells (type D7420) giving a nominal 440 V output. One battery is located underneath the crew accommodation compartment, and the other under the control compartment. Each battery has a switch circuit in the middle so it can be split into two banks of 112 cells. The cells are designed to deliver 7420 Ah over a period of five hours. All steelwork within the battery compartments is lined with rubber to protect the metal from attack by acid, and also all conducting material is insulated to prevent risks of electric shock. Waxed timber is used to make framing and crawlways to access the batteries and support them because of its resistance to acid. The battery compartment has a sump to collect any spilled liquids. Each cell weighs and contains 18.5 gallons of electrolyte. Cells are held tightly in place with wooden wedges to prevent movement with the boat. Each cell has four connector bolts to each electrode and an agitator pipe which bubbles air through the cell to ensure the electrolyte remains mixed and uniform. Cooling water is fed through pipes attached to the electrode connectors to prevent overheating and the battery temperature is monitored. In operation, each battery is charged until the voltage reaches 560 V, then allowed a further hour's charging. Fortnightly, it should be allowed 5 hours' charging after reaching 560 V to ensure a maximum charge is reached. Every two months, the battery should be given an equalising charge of eight hours to ensure all cells have reached their maximum. The battery is designed to operate with a specific gravity of the electrolyte between 1.080 and 1.280. Initial charging current should be around 1650 amps for s.g. below 1.180, 1250 A above 1.180, falling to 280 A when charging is complete. At a voltage around 538 V, the cells begin to give off explosive hydrogen gas, so the applied power is reduced during charging to keep voltage below this value until current falls to 280 A, which is then maintained while voltage is allowed to rise until the requisite voltage and charge time are reached. In an emergency, the charging current can be raised to 2000 A. To maintain overall capacity, batteries need to be completely discharged over a five-hour period once every four months and then completely recharged. The battery compartments are sealed to prevent gases escaping into the submarine, or salt water entering, which inside a battery would cause the release of poisonous chlorine gas. Ventilation fans are used to extract hydrogen released by the cells and catalytic converters are placed strategically through the submarine to remove hydrogen from the air by recombining it with oxygen to form water. Propeller motor control panel: The panel telegraph (top and left) showed instructions issued from the motor telegraph position beside the helm station in the control room which were to be carried out. Each of the two propellers on the submarine is connected to a 3000 bhp DC electric motor. Each motor is designed with two separate armatures, in effect two motors in the same unit. Speed of the submarine can be varied by connecting the batteries and armatures in different series and parallel combinations. Slowest speed is obtained by connecting both batteries in parallel, thus supplying 440 V, across all four motor armatures in series, thus applying 110 V to each ('shafts in series'). Next, the batteries in parallel may be applied across the two motors in parallel, with their armatures in series ('group down'). This applies 220 V across each armature. Third, both batteries are applied in parallel across all four armatures applying 440 V to each ('group up'). Finally, the batteries can be arranged in series so as to apply 880 V across all four armatures in parallel ('batteries in series'). Each armature also has an associated field winding which is separately supplied with current which may be varied resistively, providing further speed control (maximum 35 A). The motors are designed with a sealed oil sump from which oil is pumped continuously to lubricate the bearings. A fan draws air from the engine room through the motor to cool it and returns the exhaust air to the engine room through a water- cooled heat exchanger. This arrangement reduces the possibility of water being drawn into the motor should there be a leak in the cooler. The motor is also fitted with a heater to keep it warm when not running so as to prevent condensation internally. Temperature and revolution speed are monitored and displayed on the control panel. =Auxiliary power= The batteries provide variable DC power (VP), which ranges in normal usage from 390 to 650 V. Pumps for ballast, water, air compressors, ventilation, cooling, and hydraulics are all designed to cope with this supply range, but some equipment cannot. The boat, therefore, is supplied with two sets of auxiliary motor generators designed to be powered by the batteries and produce stable output, one set powered by each main battery. A 220 V DC supply (CP) is provided by two generators, one supplied from each battery with either being sufficient by itself. Two 60 Hz three-phase alternators provide power for equipment designed to work off 115 or 230 V AC and two more 15 kW 400 Hz generators provide power at 205 V AC used by radar, sonar, fire control, and communications electronics. Two generators plus an additional backup battery provide 24 V DC. In the event of damage to the main electrical distribution system, provision is made for one of the CP generators to be connected directly to one armature of the port motor, to provide some propulsion by alternative circuitry. =Regional variations= The preserved bow section of : The mouths of the six torpedo tubes are displayed, along with the modified sonar dome and a mockup of the bow sonar array. ;Australia :The Royal Australian Navy acquired six Oberons: an initial order of four and a second order of two. The second order was originally for four submarines, but two were cancelled in favour of expanding the RAN Fleet Air Arm.Stevens (ed.), The Royal Australian Navy, p. 194. :Australian Oberons had different electronic equipment, using primarily American radar and sonar systems. They had Sperry BQG-4 Micropuffs passive ranging sonar and Krupp CSU3-41 attack sonar. Instead of the British Tigerfish torpedoes, the Australians used American Mark 48 torpedoes. They had a slightly larger payload, carrying 22 torpedoes for the forward tubes, six of which were preloaded. Shortly after entering service, the aft torpedo tubes in all six submarines were sealed. :The Australian submarines were later updated to be equipped with the subsonic antiship Harpoon missile. In 1985, off the island of Kauai in Hawaii, HMAS Ovens became only the second conventional submarine in the world‚Äîand the first Oberon‚Äîto fire a subsurface-launched Harpoon missile, successfully hitting the target over the horizon. Consequently, the designation for the Australian Oberons changed from SS to SSG. ;Brazil :The main differences between the Brazilian and British Oberons was the fire-control systems, with a Vickers system being fitted to the Brazilian boats. The three Brazilian submarines were later upgraded to use the more advanced Mod 1 Tigerfish torpedo. ;Canada :The three Canadian submarines were built with improved air-conditioning systems, while as many common components as possible were replaced with Canadian equivalents. The Canadian Oberons used United States Navy torpedoes throughout their career: they were initially equipped with Mark 37 torpedoes, but were later upgraded for the Mark 48s. ;Chile :Chilean submarines were identical to their British counterparts except for carrying German SUT torpedoes. Service =British service= The first of the class to be commissioned into the Royal Navy was Orpheus in 1960, followed by the name vessel in 1961. The last to be commissioned was Onyx in 1967. Six were commissioned between 1967 and 1978 for the RAN. In 1982, HMS Onyx P.Hennessy and J. Jinks. The Silent Deep. The RN Submarine Service since 1945. Allen Lane (2015) London, p443-8 took part in the Falklands War, the only conventional submarine of the RN to do so, landing members of the SBS. She was escorted back to UK at 5 kn after hitting an undetected submerged reef which damaged two of its torpedo tubes, trapping a Tigerfish torpedo. It was removed back at Portsmouth.P.Hennessy and J. Jinks. The Silent Deep.(2015)London, p 446 & 451-2 All Oberons in service, including boats exported, have now been decommissioned; the last RN boats were decommissioned in 1993, with the final Canadian and Australian Oberons decommissioned in 2000. =Canadian acquisition= Roosey Roads for Operation Springboard; Jan 1969 Beginning in 1957, Canada began looking at acquiring submarines to replace the training 6th Submarine Division provided by the Royal Navy at Halifax, Nova Scotia.Ferguson, p.244 A proposal was submitted to the Canadian Chiefs of Staff in November 1959 affirming the need for a Canadian submarine service and to incorporate the acquisition of the subs into the fleet renewal plan of the late 1950s.Hadley et al., pp.144‚Äì5 The subs would be part of Canada's effort to rectify the problem of block obsolescence in its surface fleet.Gimblett, p.144 In 1960 two options were presented to the Canadian government, the first suggesting the acquisition of expensive s and the second proposing the purchase of six cheaper Oberons as part of a larger package of vessels.Ferguson, p.248Milner, p.227, 231 In March 1962, Cabinet recommended the purchase of three Oberons and eight frigates, on the condition that the cost of acquiring the submarines from the United Kingdom would be offset by British defence purchases in Canada.Ferguson, p.249Hadley et al., p.150 On 11 April 1962, the purchase was announced in the House of Commons of Canada by the Minister of National Defence, Douglas Harkness.Ferguson, p.250Hadley et al., p.152 However, the Conservative government postponed the acquisition of the Oberons due to the slow speed of the United Kingdom's attempt to offset the acquisition.Ferguson, p.251 The Conservative government was defeated in 1963 and the incoming Liberal government suspended all major defence procurement projects upon taking power.Ferguson, p.259Milner, p.237 The United Kingdom, in an effort to get the contract moving, offered the hulls of Ocelot and Opportune, but Canada passed on them. However, when Onyx became available, Canada took up the offer. The final price of $40 million for the entire contract was agreed upon in 1963.Ferguson, p.260 Since Onyx was already under construction, the boat was finished to Royal Navy specifications. All three boats received modifications to the original Oberon design, which included the enlargement of the snort de-icer, a different weapons fit, a larger air conditioning unit, active sonar and different communications equipment. The second and third hulls were built to Canadian specifications, which moved the galley forward of the control room to make room for the sonar equipment. This led to the removal of three crew bunks, a problem that was never rectified in the submarines and led to an accommodation issue for the crew.Ferguson, p.263 The first submarine was scheduled to be delivered in 1965, with the following two in 1967 and 1968, respectively. The three boats were given First Nations names; Onyx being renamed Ojibwa, Onondaga and Okanagan.Ferguson, p.261 They entered service on 23 September 1965, 22 June 1967 and 22 June 1968 respectively for service as \\"clockwork mice\\", submarines used to train surface vessels in anti-submarine warfare.Macpherson and Barrie, p.268Milner, p.265 Two further Oberons were acquired but never commissioned into the Canadian Navy. In 1989, Olympus was acquired as a stationary training vessel at Halifax, Nova Scotia.Ferguson, p.300 In 1992 Osiris was acquired for cannibalisation in a spare parts program between the UK and Canada. The submarine never sailed and was taken apart in the UK to arrive in Canada in 22,050 pieces in 1993. Submarine Operational Update Program (SOUP) By the late 1970s, the Oberons in Canadian service had become obsolete and were in need of an update. Planning was done in 1978 and the program approved in February 1979.Ferguson, p.298 In an effort to take the subs from anti- submarine warfare training to frontline service, Maritime Command developed a refit program that included new sonars, periscopes, communications and fire- control systems. They also had their armament upgraded with the fitting of torpedo tubes capable of firing the Mk 48 torpedo. This would allow the submarines to be deployed by NATO in the North Atlantic to monitor Soviet submarines.Gimblett, p.179Milner, p.273 By 1975, the fire control system aboard the Canadian Oberons was obsolete. Spare parts from the UK were becoming rarer. The Submarine Operational Update Program (SOUP) was developed to deal with the operational capability of the submarines along with a Logistic Support Agreement (LSA) to acquire more spare parts. The SOUP refits were performed during the submarines' mid-life refits. The LSA was finalised in 1989, with the acquisition of Olympus as a training vessel. However, the LSA was deemed insufficient by 1992 and the Canadian government acquired Osiris for cannibalisation. The SOUP refits comprised a new US fire control system, a digital Singer Librascope Mark I, and new Sperry passive ranging sonar with the Type 719 short range sonar removed. The new sonar was placed in the upper casing on the pressure hull. New communications and navigational systems were installed. The submarines were fitted with new torpedo tubes for Mk 48 torpedoes; however, the torpedoes themselves were considered a separate procurement program, which was only finalised in 1985.Ferguson, pp.298‚Äì9 Between 1980 and 1986, one of the Canadian Oberons was out of service undergoing the refit. SOUP came in on time and on its budget of $45 million in 1986.Ferguson, p.299Milner, p.287 SOUP kept the Canadian Oberons until the end of the 1990s when they were replaced by the British s.Gimblett, p.192 =Chilean service= operating with the destroyer during exercise Teamwork South 1999 The Chilean government required two Oberon-class submarines to be built by Scott's Shipbuilders Engineering Co., Ltd. The first was built in 1971 and launched on 22 December 1972 and given the name O'Brien, arriving at Punta Arenas on 10 August 1976. The second submarine, built in 1972, launched on 26 September 1973, was given the name Hyatt. The submarine arrived at Punta Arenas on 10 February 1977. These two submarines were able to achieve a speed of 12 knots surfaced and 17 knots submerged. With a length of 90 meters and a displacement of 2,030 tons surfaced and 2,410 tons submerged, the submarines had a 6,000 bhp engine to power them. The submarines were fitted with eight 21-inch torpedo tubes. Both submarines remained in service until 31 December 2001 where they were replaced by Sc√≤rpene-class submarines. Oberon-class submarines Hyatt and O'Brien docked together with the submarine Simpson Oberon-class submarine Hyatt, picture by the Chilean Navy =Australian service= Australian Oberon-class submarines were reported to have regularly conducted operations with special forces, although due to their limited capability these were restricted to circumstances where the boat could surface, and were usually conducted at night. This included placing divers under the casing for further covert movement, or disembarking special forces teams using kayaks or inflatable boats.Patrick 2014, p. 37. The Oberon class was arguably the best conventional submarine class of its time, with a reputation for remarkable quietness. The quietness of the Oberon vessels enabled them to operate into the late 20th century until replaced by newer classes such as the Collins and Victoria classes in Australia and Canada, respectively. Fates Helm station aboard at the Western Australian Maritime Museum As of 2006, at least fourteen Oberons are confirmed to have survived in some form. Seven have been preserved and converted into museum vessels or tourist attractions. Two have been partially preserved as monuments, while another five are awaiting conversion for museum work, or are otherwise awaiting disposal. Two of the ex-Royal Navy submarines were preserved in the UK but only one remains. HMS Onyx was moved to Barrow-in-Furness after the museum at Birkenhead, Merseyside closed but was later towed to Gareloch in Scotland where she was broken for scrap in 2014 after failed attempts to turn her into a museum. The other boat, , is located at Chatham. is harboured in Sassnitz, Germany on the island of R√ºgen and can be visited. Another two British Oberons were transferred to Canada: as a non-commissioned training vessel, and for spare parts. The other British submarines were disposed of. Australia's six Oberons have been preserved and are on display, either completely or partially. is located at the Western Australian Maritime Museum at Fremantle, while is located at the Australian National Maritime Museum in Darling Harbour, Sydney. The fin, outer hull, and stern section of are preserved on land at Holbrook, New South Wales. is located off Crib Point in Westernport Bay, Victoria, where she has been awaiting conversion into a museum vessel since 2002; a lack of funding and co-operation from local and state governments means that the volunteer group hoping to preserve Otama attempted to sell the submarine on eBay but to no avail.

Three Oberon-class submarines laid up in Halifax Harbour In 2005, it was announced that the four surviving Canadian submarines (minus Osiris, which was scrapped in 1992 after being stripped for parts) were to be sold for scrapping, as they had deteriorated beyond the point of use. was purchased for C$4 plus tax by the Site historique maritime de la Pointe-au-P√®re for use as a museum vessel, and was towed from Halifax to Pointe-au-P√®re, Quebec in July 2008. In July 2011, Olympus was towed to a scrapyard in Port Maitland, Ontario, with to be delivered to the same scrapyard in August 2011. has been preserved as part of the Elgin Military Museum. She was moved to Port Burwell, Ontario in November 2012, and will become a focal point of a new Museum of Naval History. Ojibwa opened for public tours in July 2013. One of the Brazilian Oberons (Tonelero) sank while docked at the navy yards at the Pra√ßa Mau√° on Rio de Janeiro, on 24 December 2000. The surviving Brazilian Oberon, Riachuelo, was converted into a museum at the Brazilian Navy Cultural Center (Espa√ßo Cultural da Marinha Brasileira) in Rio de Janeiro. The Chilean Navy sold to the city of Valdivia in 2002, to be converted into the first submarine museum of Chile. The submarine went through a series of modifications in the ASMAR shipyards during that year, and as of December 2017, is already on display at the end of Avenida Costanera Arturo Prat, in front of the Corte de Apelaciones building. =Successors= The Oberon class was briefly succeeded in RN service by the Upholder-class submarine. The Upholder-class submarines were later upgraded and sold to Canada for service in the Royal Canadian Navy after refit as the Victoria class, again replacing Oberons. The Australian Oberons were replaced by the six s. The two Chilean Oberons were replaced by the s O'Higgins and Carrera. The Brazilian Oberons were replaced by Type 209 submarines.

It was first named by the neurologist Joseph Babinski in 1914. Anosognosia results from physiological damage to brain structures, typically to the parietal lobe or a diffuse lesion on the fronto-temporal-parietal area in the right hemisphere, and is thus a neuropsychiatric disorder. Phenomenologically, anosognosia has similarities to denial, which is a psychological defense mechanism; attempts have been made at a unified explanation. Anosognosia is sometimes accompanied by asomatognosia, a form of neglect in which patients deny ownership of body parts such as their limbs. The term is from Ancient Greek ·ºÄ- a-, \\"without\\", ŒΩœåœÉŒøœÇ nosos, \\"disease\\" and Œ≥ŒΩ·ø∂œÉŒπœÇ gn≈çsis, \\"knowledge\\". Causes Relatively little has been discovered about the cause of the condition since its initial identification. Recent studies from the empirical data are prone to consider anosognosia a multi-componential syndrome or multi-faceted phenomenon. That is it can be manifested by failure to be aware of a number of specific deficits, including motor (hemiplegia), sensory (hemianaesthesia, hemianopia), spatial (unilateral neglect), memory (dementia), and language (receptive aphasia) due to impairment of anatomo-functionally discrete monitoring systems. Anosognosia is relatively common following different causes of brain injury, such as stroke and traumatic brain injury; for example, anosognosia for hemiparesis (weakness of one side of the body) with onset of acute stroke is estimated at between 10% and 18%. However, it can appear to occur in conjunction with virtually any neurological impairment. It is more frequent in the acute than in the chronic phase and more prominent for assessment in the cases with right hemispheric lesions than with the left. Anosognosia is not related to global mental confusion, cognitive flexibility, other major intellectual disturbances, or mere sensory/perceptual deficits. The condition does not seem to be directly related to sensory loss but is thought to be caused by damage to higher level neurocognitive processes that are involved in integrating sensory information with processes that support spatial or bodily representations (including the somatosensory system). Anosognosia is thought to be related to unilateral neglect, a condition often found after damage to the non-dominant (usually the right) hemisphere of the cerebral cortex in which people seem unable to attend to, or sometimes comprehend, anything on a certain side of their body (usually the left). Anosognosia can be selective in that an affected person with multiple impairments may seem unaware of only one handicap, while appearing to be fully aware of any others. This is consistent with the idea that the source of the problem relates to spatial representation of the body. For example, anosognosia for hemiplegia may occur with or without intact awareness of visuo-spatial unilateral neglect. This phenomenon of double dissociation can be an indicator of domain-specific disorders of awareness modules, meaning that in anosognosia, brain damage can selectively impact the self-monitoring process of one specific physical or cognitive function rather than a spatial location of the body. There are also studies showing that the maneuver of vestibular stimulation could temporarily improve both the syndrome of spatial unilateral neglect and of anosognosia for left hemiplegia. Combining the findings of hemispheric asymmetry to the right, association with spatial unilateral neglect, and the temporal improvement on both syndromes, it is suggested there can be a spatial component underlying the mechanism of anosognosia for motor weakness and that neural processes could be modulated similarly. There were some cases of anosognosia for right hemiplegia after left hemisphere damage, but the frequency of this type of anosognosia has not been estimated. Those diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease often display this lack of awareness and insist that nothing is wrong with them. Anosognosia may occur as part of receptive aphasia, a language disorder that causes poor comprehension of speech and the production of fluent but incomprehensible sentences. A patient with receptive aphasia cannot correct his own phonetics errors and shows \\"anger and disappointment with the person with whom s/he is speaking because that person fails to understand her/him\\". This may be a result of brain damage to the posterior portion of the superior temporal gyrus, believed to contain representations of word sounds. With those representations significantly distorted, patients with receptive aphasia are unable to monitor their mistakes. Other patients with receptive aphasia are fully aware of their condition and speech inhibitions, but cannot monitor their condition, which is not the same as anosognosia and therefore cannot explain the occurrence of neologistic jargon. Psychiatry Although largely used to describe unawareness of impairment after brain injury or stroke, the term 'anosognosia' is occasionally used to describe the lack of insight shown by some people with anorexia nervosa. They do not seem to recognize that they have a mental illness. There is evidence that 'anosognosia' related to schizophrenia may be the result of frontal lobe damage. E. Fuller Torrey, a psychiatrist and schizophrenia researcher, has stated that among those with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, anosognosia is the most prevalent reason for not taking medications. Diagnosis Clinically, anosognosia is often assessed by giving patients an anosognosia questionnaire in order to assess their metacognitive knowledge of deficits. However, neither of the existing questionnaires applied in the clinics are designed thoroughly for evaluating the multidimensional nature of this clinical phenomenon; nor are the responses obtained via offline questionnaire capable of revealing the discrepancy of awareness observed from their online task performance. The discrepancy is noticed when patients showed no awareness of their deficits from the offline responses to the questionnaire but demonstrated reluctance or verbal circumlocution when asked to perform an online task. For example, patients with anosognosia for hemiplegia may find excuses not to perform a bimanual task even though they do not admit it is because of their paralyzed arms. A similar situation can happen to patients with anosognosia for cognitive deficits after traumatic brain injury when monitoring their errors during the tasks regarding their memory and attention (online emergent awareness) and when predicting their performance right before the same tasks (online anticipatory awareness). It can also occur among patients with dementia and anosognosia for memory deficit when prompted with dementia-related words, showing possible pre-attentive processing and implicit knowledge of their memory problems. Patients with anosognosia may also overestimate their performance when asked in first-person formed questions but not from a third- person perspective when the questions referring to others. When assessing the causes of anosognosia within stroke patients, CT scans have been used to assess where the greatest amount of damage is found within the various areas of the brain. Stroke patients with mild and severe levels of anosognosia (determined by response to an anosognosia questionnaire) have been linked to lesions within the temporoparietal and thalamic regions, when compared to those who experience moderate anosognosia, or none at all. In contrast, after a stroke, people with moderate anosognosia have a higher frequency of lesions involving the basal ganglia, compared to those with mild or severe anosognosia. Treatment In regard to anosognosia for neurological patients, no long-term treatments exist. As with unilateral neglect, caloric reflex testing (squirting ice cold water into the left ear) is known to temporarily ameliorate unawareness of impairment. It is not entirely clear how this works, although it is thought that the unconscious shift of attention or focus caused by the intense stimulation of the vestibular system temporarily influences awareness. Most cases of anosognosia appear to simply disappear over time, while other cases can last indefinitely. Normally, long-term cases are treated with cognitive therapy to train patients to adjust for their inoperable limbs (though it is believed that these patients still are not \\"aware\\" of their disability). Another commonly used method is the use of feedback ‚Äì comparing clients' self-predicted performance with their actual performance on a task in an attempt to improve insight. Neurorehabilitation is difficult because, as anosognosia impairs the patient's desire to seek medical aid, it may also impair their ability to seek rehabilitation. A lack of awareness of the deficit makes cooperative, mindful work with a therapist difficult. In the acute phase, very little can be done to improve their awareness, but during this time, it is important for the therapist to build a therapeutic alliance with patients by entering their phenomenological field and reducing their frustration and confusion. Since severity changes over time, no single method of treatment or rehabilitation has emerged or will likely emerge. In regard to psychiatric patients, empirical studies verify that, for individuals with severe mental illnesses, lack of awareness of illness is significantly associated with both medication non-compliance and re-hospitalization. Fifteen percent of individuals with severe mental illnesses who refuse to take medication voluntarily under any circumstances may require some form of coercion to remain compliant because of anosognosia. Coercive psychiatric treatment is a delicate and complex legal and ethical issue. One study of voluntary and involuntary inpatients confirmed that committed patients require coercive treatment because they fail to recognize their need for care. The patients committed to the hospital had significantly lower measures of insight than the voluntary patients. Anosognosia is also closely related to other cognitive dysfunctions that may impair the capacity of an individual to continuously participate in treatment. Other research has suggested that attitudes toward treatment can improve after involuntary treatment and that previously committed patients tend later to seek voluntary treatment.

He claimed to have performed psychic surgery with his hands or with simple kitchen utensils while in a mediumistic trance, therefore he was also known as the Surgeon of the Rusty Knife. During his operations he supposedly embodied the spirit of Dr. Adolf Fritz. Biography Z√© Arig√≥ was born Jos√© Pedro de Freitas on a farm located 6 kilometers from Congonhas do Campo, in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. His family was very poor and he could only study up to the third grade of school. At the age of 14 he began working at a mine where he worked for 6 years. According to his autobiography, around 1950 he began to suffer from strong headaches, insomnia, trances, and hallucinations. One day he felt that the voice that had been pursuing him took over his body, and he had a vision of a bald man, dressed in a white apron and supervising a team of doctors and nurses in an enormous operating room. This entity identified itself as \\"Dr. Fritz.\\" After claiming to have channeled Dr. Fritz, Arig√≥ began to perform operations using scalpels and needles. His reputation soared and spread throughout Brazil after it was alleged that he had removed a cancerous tumor from the lung of a well-known Brazilian senator. Over the next twenty years, thousands of people who mistrusted traditional medicine, or had not found help in it, came to Congonhas in search of a cure. In 1956 Arig√≥ was convicted of illegally practicing medicine. He was sentenced to 15 months in prison, but was pardoned by President of Brazil Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira. In 1962 he was arrested and held for seven months for practicing medicine without a license. However, he was allowed to continue treating people while held in jail. Arig√≥ died in 1971 in an automobile accident. Critical reception Magician and skeptic James Randi considered the psychic surgery of Arig√≥ to be the result of sleight of hand trickery. Randi published a photograph of himself performing a knife stunt that Arig√≥ was alleged to have performed. Skeptical investigator Joe Nickell has written that Arig√≥ \\"prescribed various potions and concoctions that obviously depended for their effectiveness on the placebo effect. His prescriptions were filled at the only pharmacy in town run by the amateur doctor's brother. By such means were Arigo's alleged \\"miracle healings\\" actually performed.\\" Philosopher and skeptic Robert Todd Carroll author of The Skeptic's Dictionary considered Arig√≥ to be a hoaxer.Carroll, Robert Todd.

They form two rows, one on each side. For the purpose of this article, they are listed in the order they are passed when crossing the bridge from the Old Town to the Lesser Quarter, and are divided into two categories: those on the north side of the bridge and those on the south side. The statue of Bruncv√≠k is also included, although it is not considered one of the principal statues. Damage caused to the statues over many years has resulted in many of the originals being replaced by copies. Statues on the south side of the bridge = Statue of St. Ivo = (souso≈°√≠ sv. Iva or Ivona) The original was made by Matthias Braun in 1711, paid for by the Law faculty of Charles University. The statue portrays St. Ivo as the patron saint of lawyers, accompanied by an allegorical depiction of Justice. = Statues of saints Barbara, Margaret and Elizabeth = (souso≈°√≠ sv. Barbory, Mark√©ty a Al≈æbƒõty) The statues were sculpted by Ferdinand Brokoff in 1707. Although there is an inscription saying IOANN BROKOFF FECIT (made by Jan Brokoff), their style is evidence that his son Ferdinand is their true author. = Statue of the Lamentation of Christ = (souso≈°√≠ Piety) Designed by Emanuel Max in 1858, upon commission from the Old Town's public authorities, the statue depicts Mary Magdalene and the Virgin Mary mourning the dead Christ. At this position on the bridge, there was originally a wooden crucifix, which was destroyed by a flood in 1496. In 1695, a statue depicting the lamentation of Christ by Jan Brokoff was installed here; this was removed to the Monastery of Gracious Nurses under Pet≈ô√≠n hill in Prague in 1859 and replaced by the current statue. = Statue of St. Joseph = (socha sv. Josefa) This statue was designed by Josef Max and sponsored by Josef Bergmann, a tradesman in Prague. It depicts St. Joseph leading a small Christ, and is situated on a pseudo-Gothic base. It replaced a statue with the same motif by Jan Brokoff, designed in 1706. This was damaged by cannon fire during the 1848 revolution and was replaced by the current statue in 1854. = Statue of St. Francis Xavier = (souso≈°√≠ Franti≈°ka Xaversk√©ho) This statue is a 1913 replica by ƒåenƒõk Vosm√≠k of Ferdinand Brokoff's original 1711 sculpture. The original sculpture was commissioned of the Faculty of Theology and Philosophy of Charles University, but fell into the river during the floods of 1890. The statue depicts an Indian and a Japanese prince being baptized by the saint, along with a Moor in chains and a Tatar. = Statue of St. Christopher = (socha sv. Kry≈°tofa) This statue was designed by Emanuel Max in 1857 and sponsored by V√°clav Wanek, the portreeve of Prague. It depicts the saint holding Christ as a boy on his shoulder. The statue was originally conceived by Count Anton√≠n Sporck, who wanted to build a marble statue as tribute to Charles VI in 1720. A plan of this was created by Matthias Braun, which was not executed. = Statue of St. Francis Borgia = (souso≈°√≠ sv. Franti≈°ka Borgi√°≈°e) This statue was commissioned from Ferdinand Brokoff by the imperial Burgrave Franti≈°ek z Collet≈Ø in 1710. The sculpture portrays St. Borgia, a Jesuit priest, with two angels. = Statue of St. Ludmila = (socha sv. Ludmily) The exact date and sculptor responsible for this statue are not known, although it is believed that it was created by Matthias Braun around 1730. The sculpture was erected on the bridge in 1784 to replace the statue of St. Wenceslas damaged in the floods in that year. The statue depicts St. Ludmila teaching her grandson, St. Wenceslas and the base contains a relief sculpture showing the murder of St. Wenceslas. = Statue of St. Francis of Assisi = (socha sv. Franti≈°ka Serafinsk√©ho) Sculpted by Emanuel Max in 1855, the statue was donated by count Franti≈°ek Anton√≠n Kolowrat Liebsteinsk√Ω. It portrays St. Francis standing with two neoclassic angels, on a pseudo-baroque base. The sculpture replaced a similar statue designed in 1708 by Franti≈°ek Preis. = Statue of Saints Vincent Ferrer and Procopius + Bruncv√≠k column = (souso≈°√≠ sv. Vincence Ferrarsk√©ho a sv. Prokopa) One of the most artistically important pieces on the bridge, this statue was sculpted by Ferdinand Brokoff in 1712, paid for by Romedius Josef Franti≈°ek, the count Thun and lord of Choltice. St. Vincent is on the left, with a coffin and a kneeling penitent sinner by his legs. Saint Procopius of S√°zava stands on a devil to the right. Beside the statue of Sts. Vincent and Procopius stands a column with a sculpture of Bruncvik, (a mythical Bohemian knight inspired by the Saxonian and Bavarian knight Henry the Lion from Brunswick), portrayed helping a lion fight a seven-headed dragon. This was sculpted by Ludv√≠k ≈†imek in 1884, and sponsored by the City of Prague. The knight, Bruncv√≠k, is holding a golden sword, with a lion lying by his legs. This replaced a statue of Roland, erected in 1502, and was intended to remind passers-by of the Old Town's privileges to the bridge, in particular the right to charge tolls and duty. It was damaged by cannon fire when the city was attacked by Swedish forces in 1648. = Statue of St. Nicholas of Tolentino = (socha sv. Mikul√°≈°e Tolentinsk√©ho) Sculpted by Jan Bed≈ôich Kohl in 1708, this statue was paid for by the Augustinian order convent of St. Thomas in Prague. The saint is portrayed standing on a simple base, together with an angel holding a basket of bread. = Statue of St. Luthgard (Dream of St. Luthgard) = (socha sv. Luitgardy) Possibly the most valuable piece of art on the bridge, the statue of St. Luthgard was sculpted by Matthias Braun in 1710 as a commission from Ev≈æen Tyttl, the abbot of the Cistercian monastery in Plasy. = Statue of St. Adalbert = (socha sv. Vojtƒõcha) Designed by Michael and Ferdinand Brokoff in 1709, this statue was sponsored by Markus Bernard Joanelli, the councilor of the Old Town of Prague. The saint is represented with a prelate stick developing into a sea paddle and is standing on a base decorated with angels and the emblem of the donor. = Statues of Saints John of Matha, Felix of Valois, and Ivan = (souso≈°√≠ sv. Jana z Mathy, Felixe z Valois a Ivana) The most spacious and expensive sculpture on the bridge, this was designed in 1714 by Ferdinand Brokoff and sponsored by Franti≈°ek Josef Thun, the lord of Kl√°≈°terec nad Oh≈ô√≠. The sculpture was intended to honour the two founders of the Trinitarians, the order that supervised buying back and redeeming of Christians in captivity under Turks. St. Ivan, the saint patron of Slavs was added to the group for unknown reasons. The base depicts a cave in which three chained Christians are praying to the Lord for salvation. = Statue of St. Wenceslas = (socha sv. V√°clava) This statue was designed by Karel B√∂hm in 1858 and was based on the design by Josef Kamil F√ºhring. The statue was paid for by the Institute of the Blind at Kl√°rov, Prague. Until 1822, various little shops stood on this part of the bridge. Statues on the north side of the bridge =Statue of the Madonna attending to St. Bernard= (Czech: souso≈°√≠ Madony se sv. Bernardem) This statue was sculpted by Matƒõj V√°clav J√§ckl in 1709 and donated by the abbot of the Cistercian monastery in Osek, Benedikt Littwerig. =Statue of the Madonna, Ss. Dominic and Thomas Aquinas= (souso≈°√≠ Madony se sv. Dominikem a Tom√°≈°em Akvinsk√Ωm) This group was sculpted by Matƒõj V√°clav J√§ckel in 1708, and sponsored by the Dominicans Convent of St. Giles in the Old Town of Prague. The statue portrays the Madonna giving the Rosary to St. Dominic on the left, with St. Thomas Aquinas standing to the right. =The Crucifix and Calvary= Statuary of the Holy Crucifix and Calvary (souso≈°√≠ K≈ô√≠≈æe s Kalv√°ri√≠) This sculpture is one of the most historically interesting sculptures on the bridge, which gradually gained its present appearance throughout many centuries. The original wooden crucifix was installed at this place soon after 1361 and probably destroyed by the Hussites in 1419. A new crucifix with a wooden corpus was erected in 1629 but was severely damaged by the Swedes towards the end of the Thirty Years' War. The remnants of this crucifix can be found in the lapidarium of the National Museum in Prague. This was replaced by another wooden Calvary which, in turn, was replaced with a metal version in 1657. Bought in Dresden, this crucifix was originally made in 1629 by H. Hillger based upon a design by W. E. Brohn. In 1666, two lead figures were added, but these were replaced in 1861 by the present sandstone statues by Emanuel Max, portraying the Virgin Mary and John the Evangelist. The golden Hebrew text on the crucifix was added in 1696 and is a prime example of Medieval European anti-Semitism. In that year, the Prague authorities accused a local Jewish leader, named Elias Backoffen, of blasphemy. As his punishment he was ordered to raise the funds for the purchasing of gold-plated Hebrew letters, placed around the head of the statue, spelling out \\"Holy, Holy, Holy, the Lord of Hosts,\\" the Kedusha from the Hebrew prayer and originating in the vision from the Book of Isaiah. The inscription was a symbolic humiliation and degradation of Prague Jews. Steven Plaut: ‚ÄúThe Vav from the Charles Bridge‚Äù, The Jewish Magazine, November 2003 A bronze tablet with explanatory text in Czech, English and Hebrew was mounted under the statue by the City of Prague in 2000. The tablet's placement came after an American Rabbi, Ronald Brown of Temple Beth Am in Merrick, New York was passing over the bridge and noted the possibly offensive nature of the placing of the text. Upon a direct request to the mayor, the tablet was soon placed to the side of the statue. =Statue of St. Anne= (socha sv. Anny) Designed by Matƒõj V√°clav J√§ckel in 1707, at the expense of count Rudolf of Lisov, the hetman of the New Town of Prague, this statue represents St. Anne, mother of the Virgin Mary, who is portrayed here as a young girl. =Statue of St. Cyril and St. Methodius= (souso≈°√≠ sv. Cyrila a Metodƒõje) This statue was sculpted by Karel Dvo≈ô√°k between 1928 and 1939 and was erected by the Ministry of education. It portrays the saints Cyril and Methodius (missionaries who introduced Christianity to the Slavs). The original statue of St. Ignatius which stood here, designed by Ferdinand Brokoff in 1711, was displaced by the floods of 1890 and can now be found in the Prague lapidarium. =Statue of St. John the Baptist= (socha sv. Jana K≈ôtitele) Sculpted by Josef Max in 1857, at the expenses of Jan Norbert Gemrich of Neuberk, this statue depicts a standing St. John. This replaces a statue by Jan Brokoff, portraying the Baptism of Jesus by St. John, which stood in this position between 1706 and 1848. =Statue of Saints Norbert of Xanten, Wenceslas and Sigismund= Statue of Saints Norbert of Xanten, Wenceslas and Sigismund on Charles Bridge in Prague (souso≈°√≠ sv. Norberta, V√°clava a Zikmunda) This statue was designed by Josef Max in 1853, under the patronage of the abbot of Strahov Monastery, Dr. Jeron√Ωm Zeidler. =Statue of St. John of Nepomuk= statue of John of Nepomuk (socha sv. Jana Nepomuck√©ho) This statue is the oldest on the bridge. The original clay design was made by Austrian sculptor Matthias Rauchm√ºller, based upon a wood model by Jan Brokoff. The statue was then cast in bronze by Volfgang Jeron√Ωm Heroldt in Nuremberg. The saint is presented in a traditional way, as a bearded capitulary with a five-star glory, standing on a tripartite base. The base portrays scenes from the life of St. John of Nepomuk, including the confession of Queen Johanna and the saint's death. In 1393 St. John of Nepomuk was thrown from the bridge into the river where he drowned. In modern times it has become traditional to touch the bridge here; this is held to bring good fortune and to ensure that the visitor will return to the city of Prague. =Statue of St. Anthony of Padua= (socha sv. Anton√≠na Padu√°nsk√©ho) Designed by Jan Old≈ôich Mayer in 1707 and sponsored by Kri≈°tof Mo≈ôice Withauer, councilor of the Prague Castle burgraviate, this statue represents St. Anthony standing between two vases, holding Jesus. =Statue of St. Jude Thaddeus= (socha sv. Juda Tade√°≈°e) This sculpture portrays St. Jude holding a rod. It was sculpted by Jan Old≈ôich Mayer in 1708 and paid for by Franti≈°ek Sezima, the knight Mitrovsk√Ω from Nemy≈°le and Je≈ôichovice. =Statue of St. Augustine= (socha sv. Augustina) Designed by Jan Bed≈ôich Kohl in 1708 and paid for by the Augustinian convent of St. Thomas in Prague, this portrays the philosopher holding a hook and a burning heart. He is followed by an angel attempting to pour the sea out of a sea-shell. =Statue of St. Cajetan= (socha sv. Kajet√°na) This statue was sculpted by Ferdinand Brokoff in 1709, and sponsored by the convent of Theatins in Prague. The Saint, founder of the religious order of Theatins, is portrayed holding a book and standing before an obelisk representing the Trinity. =Statue of St. Philip Benitius= (socha sv. Filipa Benicia) Designed by Michal Bernard Mandel in 1714, this statue was made from Salzburg marble and donated by the Servites convent in Prague. The statue portrays St. Philip Benitius, fifth general of the Servites, holding a cross, a book and a spray. By his legs there is the crown of the Pope. A clay model of this statue can be found in the Salzburg museum. =Statuary of St. Vitus= (socha sv. V√≠ta) Sculpted by Ferdinand Brokoff in 1714, this statue was donated by Matƒõj Vojtƒõch Macht of L√∂wenmacht, the dean of the Vy≈°ehrad canonry. St. Vitus is portrayed standing on a base in the shape of cave, from which lions crawl up. The Saint is depicted as a Roman aristocrat, martyred for his faith. Duke Wenceslas acquired a number of his relics to honor the founding of St. Vitus Cathedral at Prague Castle. These relics, together with others acquired by Charles IV in 1355, are embedded in the cathedral building. =Statue of the Holy Savior with Cosmas and Damian= (souso≈°√≠ sv. Salvatora se sv. Kosmou a Dami√°nem) Designed by Jan Old≈ôich Mayer in 1709, at the expense of the faculty of medicine, University of Prague, this statue portrays Jesus with the patron saints of medicine placed on either side.

Washington, in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Although it draws hikers throughout the year, and skiers throughout the winter, it is best known for the many \\"spring skiers\\" who ascend it on foot and ski down the steep slope from early April into July. In this period, the temperatures are relatively mild but the natural snowpack ‚Äî which averages up to in a typical winter ‚Äî is still adequate to ski most seasons. The record-setting high winds atop Mount Washington scour a massive amount of snow from the surrounding highlands and drop it here or in the adjacent Huntington Ravine. Thousands of people have been known to ski Tuckerman in a single spring weekend. Skiing is not limited to this time, but the avalanche danger, peaking from late December to early March, requires special training and experience to assess and navigate the ravine safely during the winter. Avalanches have killed at least 10 people in the ravine since the 1960s. The ravine, whose name is often shortened to \\"Tucks\\" in comments and on commemorative materialsAMC Store: Tux is most easily accessed from the AMC Visitor Center on Route 16 at Pinkham Notch, via the moderate lower section of the Tuckerman Ravine Trail. This trail is maintained in winter and spring as a \\"cat\\" trail, and parallels the Sherburne Trail used for ski and snowboard descents. It is a elevation drop from the foot of Tuckerman to the lodge.  Anatomy of the Bowl  Tuckerman Ravine has many different runs that span the bowl, all as steep as 40 to 55 degrees. From the base of the bowl, the run farthest to the left is known simply as \\"Left Gully\\" and is one of the easiest runs. Moving to the right, the runs are more challenging and steeper. More to the right, \\"The Chute\\" drops between two large cliffs that slowly narrow the run. Still farther to the right are the Center Gullies, which includes \\"The Icefall\\", which is 55 degrees, and requires skiers to go off cliffs as tall as . Right of \\"The Icefall\\" is \\"The Lip\\". It is an open run that averages between 50 and 55 degrees. \\"Right Gully\\", one of the bowl's easier runs, drops into \\"The Sluice\\" about halfway down, and averages about 40 degrees. View of Tuckerman Ravine from above Left Gully  History  The ravine is named after botanist Edward Tuckerman who studied alpine plants and lichens in the area in the 1830s and 1840s. According to the New England Ski Museum, the first recorded use of skis on Mount Washington was by a Dr. Wiskott of Breslau, Germany, who skied on the mountain in 1899, while the first skier in Tuckerman was John S. Apperson of Schenectady, New York, in April 1914. According to the Mount Washington Avalanche Center, the first known death associated with the bowl is a 15-year- old \\"killed by falling ice\\" on July 24, 1886; the first recorded death associated with icefall was in January 1936; the first death associated with falling into a crevasse was in June 1940; and the first skiing-related death was in April 1943. In 1933 the Civilian Conservation Corps started to cut ski trails in the White Mountains, including the Richard Taft racing trail on Cannon Mountain, and later the John Sherburne Ski Trail on Mount Washington, which runs from what is today the Hermit Lake cabin down to the Pinkham Notch Visitors Center operated by the Appalachian Mountain Club. The headwall was first run by two Dartmouth students, John Carleton and Charles Proctor, on April 11, 1931, and was quickly followed by a group from Harvard who skied the headwall from the summit of Mount Washington for the first time. The ravine soon became an important site for extreme skiing in New England. = American Inferno races = Races held in the 1930s attracted large groups of spectators and skiers. Harvard-Dartmouth slaloms, Olympic tryouts, and giant slaloms all were held in the ravine in that decade. But the races that caught the imagination more than any other, the races that still are talked about by Tuckerman skiers, were the three American Infernos of the 1930s. Two years after the headwall was first run on April 11, 1931, by Dartmouth men John Carleton and Charles N. Proctor, the Ski Club Hochgebirge proposed a summit- to-base race on Mt. Washington, to be called the American Inferno, named for a similar race held in M√ºrren, Switzerland. The first race was held on April 16, 1933, and was won by Hollis Phillips in 14:41:03. The following year's race was won by Dick Durrance, who beat Phillips' record and completed the course in 12:35:00. In the late winter of 1939, several veteran skiers proposed a repeat Inferno top-to-bottom race due to the ravine's deep snowpack. The 1939 American Inferno is remembered for Toni Matt's split-second decision to ski a straight line from the crest of the headwall down through the bowl's full run. A recent Austrian immigrant, Matt had recently won a number of downhill ski races, including the Sun Valley Open Downhill, the Mount Greylock No-Fall Race, the Eastern Downhill Championships at Stowe, the Hochgebirge Downhill at Franconia, and the National Downhill Championships at Mount Hood. At a 50-year anniversary party in 1989, Matt recalled his descent: > \\"I went right and then left and then right and then said, well, now is the > time to straighten them out. So I did and I kept waiting. Finally I dropped > over the Lip...So I schussed on top of the Lip, went over it, and by that > time, you're doing maybe 80 miles an hour and there's no sense in turning, > especially if you can't turn well. So you say, well, you might as well go > straight, you know, and hope for the best. So [I] went straight and hoped > for the best.\\" Matt completed his ski run in 6 minutes and 29.4 seconds, reaching a top speed of . After a leg injury, he retired from ski racing in 1951, but continued to coach and officiate internationally until his retirement after the 1980 Lake Placid Olympics. In 1967 he was inducted into the Ski Hall of Fame. A shortened course was run in the spring of 1952 (because of a cloud-shrouded summit) that started just above the lip of the headwall, and was won by Dartmouth's Bill Beck.

Life and succession Hamilton was born at Shanklin, Isle of Wight, in 1862, the son of Captain Charles Douglas-Hamilton (1808‚Äì1873), a great-great-grandson of the 4th Duke of Hamilton. He served as a young man in the Royal Navy, and gained a reputation for being able to dive under the keels of the battleships on which he served, without any equipment, reappearing on the opposite side of the ship to the amazement of his crewmates. He was persuaded to leave in 1888 by his fourth cousin the twelfth Duke in 1890. There was a quite serious possibility that Alfred would provide a good match for the heirless twelfth duke's daughter, Lady Mary. These hopes of maintaining continuity were dashed however in 1890, when Hamilton was partially paralysed by a rare tropical disease he had caught whilst on his last tour of duty. Hamilton recovered however and succeeded in 1895. Whilst inheriting all entailed property and assets from his cousin and a ¬£1 million debt, a large share of the Hamilton lands and properties went to Lady Mary, latterly the Duchess of Montrose. The properties that left the Hamilton family at this time included Brodick Castle on Arran, which had been owned by the Hamiltons for 500 years. One property that did not leave the family was Hamilton Palace, the main family seat. However, the Duke had offered the palace to the Navy during World War I for use as a hospital. Following the end of the war it was considered necessary to demolish it due to subsidence, blamed on the family's own coal mines. Hamilton moved to Dungavel House, which had previously been a Hamilton shooting lodge on moorland close to Strathaven. Hamilton was honorary lieutenant-colonel of the 4th Battalion, Highland Light Infantry. He was also honorary colonel of the 6th Battalion, the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles). Hamilton died shortly after his 78th birthday, on 16 March 1940 at the family's property in Dorset, Ferne House. Marriage and issue Hamilton married on 4 December 1901, at the parish church, Newton Tony, to Nina Mary Benita Poore, daughter of Major Robert Poore,. She was the founder of the Animal Defence and Anti-Vivisection Society. They had four sons and three daughters: * Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, 14th Duke of Hamilton * Lady Jean Douglas-Hamilton * George Douglas-Hamilton, 10th Earl of Selkirk * Lady Margaret Douglas-Hamilton (the mother of Anneli Drummond-Hay) * Lord Malcolm Douglas-Hamilton * Lord David Douglas-Hamilton * Lady Mairi Nina Douglas- Hamilton Hamilton's sons made RAF history by all being of the rank of Squadron Leader or above at the outbreak of World War II.

Engineering management is a career that brings together the technological problem-solving ability of engineering and the organizational, administrative, and planning abilities of management in order to oversee the operational performance of complex engineering driven enterprises. A Master of Engineering Management (MEM) is sometimes compared to a Master of Business Administration (MBA) for professionals seeking a graduate degree as a qualifying credential for a career in engineering management. History Stevens Institute of Technology is believed to have the oldest engineering management department, established as the School of Business Engineering in 1908. This was later called the Bachelor of Engineering in Engineering Management (BEEM) program and moved into the School of Systems and Enterprises. Syracuse University established the first graduate engineering management degree in the U.S., which was first offered in 1957. In 1967 the first university department explicitly titled \\"Engineering Management\\" was founded at the Missouri University of Science and Technology (Missouri S&T;, formerly the University of Missouri-Rolla, formerly Missouri School of Mines). In 1959, Western Michigan University began offering the predecessor to the modern engineering management bachelor's degree (titled \\"Industrial Supervision\\") and in 1977, WMU started its MS degree in Manufacturing Administration, later renamed as Engineering Management. Outside the US, in Germany the first department concentrating on Engineering Management was established 1927 in Berlin. In Turkey the Istanbul Technical University has a Management Engineering Department established in 1982, offering a number of graduate and undergraduate programs in Management Engineering. In UK the University of Warwick has a specialised department WMG (previously known as Warwick Manufacturing Group) established in 1980, which offers a graduate programme in MSc Engineering Business Management. Michigan Technological University began an Engineering Management program in the School of Business & Economics in the Fall of 2012. In Canada, Memorial University of Newfoundland has started a complete master's degree Program in Engineering Management.Master of Engineering Management In Denmark, the Technical University of Denmark offers a MSc program in Engineering Management (in English).MSc in Engineering Management . In Pakistan, University of Engineering and Technology, Taxila, University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore and National University of Science and Technology (NUST) offer admission both at Master and Doctorate level in Engineering Management while Capital University of Science & Technology (CUST), NED University of Engineering & Technology, Karachi and Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology have been running a Master of Engineering/MS in Engineering Management program. A variant of this program is within Quality Management. COMSATS (CIIT) offers a MSc Project Management program to Local and Overseas Pakistanis as an on-campus/off-campus student. In Italy, Politecnico di Milano offers degrees in Management Engineering., among many other public or private (and publicly-accredited) universities belonging to the same post-secondary academic degrees'classification. In Russia, since 2014 the Faculty of Engineering Management of The Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration (RANEPA) offers bachelor's and master's degrees in Engineering Management. In France, the EPF will offer, from January 2018, a 2-year Engineering & Management major in English for the 4th and 5th years of its 5-year Engineering master's degree. The final 2 years are open to students who have completed an undergraduate engineering degree elsewhere.EPF:Engineering Management Paris Campus Areas Engineering Management is a broad field and can cover a wide range of technical and managerial topics. An important resource is the Engineering Management Body of Knowledge (EMBoK). The topics below are representative of typical topics in the field. = Leadership and Organization Management = Leadership and organization management are concerned with the skills involving positive direction of technical organizations and motivation of employees. = Operations, operations research, and supply chain = Operations management is concerned with designing and controlling the process of production and redesigning business operations in the production of goods or services. Operations research deals with quantitative models of complex operations and uses these models to support decision-making in any sector of industry or public services. Supply chain management is the process of planning, implementing and managing the flow of goods, services and related information from the point of origin to the point of consumption.University of Waterloo , Management Engineering. = Management of technology = The Management of Technology (MOT) theme builds on the foundation of management topics in accounting, finance, economics, organizational behavior and organizational design. Courses in this theme deal with operational and organizational issues related to managing innovation and technological change. = New product development and product engineering = New product development (NPD) is the complete process of bringing a new product to market. Product engineering refers to the process of designing and developing a device, assembly, or system such that it be produced as an item for sale through some production manufacturing process. Product engineering usually entails activity dealing with issues of cost, producibility, quality, performance, reliability, serviceability, intended lifespan and user features. Project Management techniques are used to manage the design and development progress using the phase-gate model in the product development process. Design for manufacturability (also sometimes known as design for manufacturing or DFM) is the general engineering art of designing products in such a way that they are easy to manufacture. = Systems engineering = Systems engineering is an interdisciplinary field of engineering and engineering management that focuses on how to design and manage complex systems over their life cycles. = Industrial engineering = Industrial engineering is a branch of engineering which deals with the optimization of complex processes, systems or organizations. Industrial engineers work to eliminate waste of time, money, materials, man-hours, machine time, energy and other resources that do not generate value. = Management science = Management science uses various scientific research-based principles, strategies, and analytical methods including mathematical modeling, statistics and numerical algorithms to improve an organization's ability to enact rational and meaningful management decisions by arriving at optimal or near optimal solutions to complex decision problems. =Engineering design management= Engineering design management represents the adaptation and application of customary management practices, with the intention of achieving a productive engineering design process. Engineering design management is primarily applied in the context of engineering design teams, whereby the activities, outputs and influences of design teams are planned, guided, monitored and controlled. Education Engineering management programs typically include instruction in accounting, economics, finance, project management, systems engineering, industrial engineering, mathematical modeling and optimization, management information systems, quality control & six sigma, operations management, operations research, human resources management, industrial psychology, safety and health.U.S. Department of Education Institute of Education Sciences: Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) - Retrieved on October 26, 2009ATMAE Membership Venn Diagram There are many options for entering into engineering management, albeit that the foundation requirement is an engineering degree (or other computer science, mathematics or science degree) and a business degree. Undergraduate degrees Although most engineering management programs are geared for graduate studies, there are a number of institutions that teach EM at the undergraduate level. Over twenty undergraduate engineering management related programs are accredited by ABET including: West Point (United States Military Academy), Western Michigan Universityhttps://www.wmich.edu/edmms/academics/undergraduate/engmanagementtech (ABET-accredited by ETAC of ABET), Stevens Institute of Technology, Gonzaga University, Virginia Tech, Arizona State University, Missouri University of Science and Technology. Graduates of these programs regularly command nearly $65,000 their first year out of school. Outside the US, Istanbul Technical University Management Engineering Department offers an undergraduate degree in Management Engineering, attracting top students. The University of Waterloo offers a 4-year undergraduate degree (5 years including co-op education) in the field of Management Engineering. This is the first program of its kind in Canada. In Peru, Pacifico University offers a five-year undergraduate degree in this field, the first program in this country. In Germany, ESB Business SchoolESB Business School offers a 4-year undergraduate program which consists of five semesters at ESB Business School, two mandatory internships, one is mandatory to be in another country than Germany, and also one mandatory semester abroad.

Graduate degrees Many universities offer Master of Engineering Management degrees. Missouri S&T; is credited with awarding the first Ph.D. in Engineering Management in 1984. The National Institute of Industrial Engineering based in Mumbai has been awarding degrees in the field of Post Graduate Diploma in Industrial Engineering since 1973 and the Fellowship (Doctoral) degrees have been awarded since 2008. Western Michigan University began offering the MS in Manufacturing Administration degree in 1977 and later renamed the degree as Master of Science in Engineering Management.https://www.wmich.edu/ieeem/academics/masters WMU's MSEM alumni work in the automotive, medical, manufacturing, and service sectors, often in roles of project manager, engineering manager, and senior leadership in engineering and technical organizations. Cornell University started one of the first Engineering Management Masters programs in 1988 with the launch of their Master of Engineering (M.Eng.) in Engineering Management. The program allows students access to courses and programs in the College of Engineering, Johnson School of Management, and across Cornell University more broadly. Massachusetts Institute of Technology offers a Master in System Design and Management, which is a member of the Consortium of Engineering Management. Lamar University offers a Master of Engineering Management degree with flexible content to adjust to diverse engineering fields, with core content that includes operations management, accounting, and decision sciences. Netaji Subhas Institute of technology (NSIT, website as http://www.nsit.ac.in/ under University of Delhi)New Delhi also provides M.tech degree in Engineering management. Admission to this program happens through GATE(Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering) examination. Students in the University of Kansas' Engineering Management Program are practicing professionals employed by over 100 businesses, manufacturing, government or consulting firms. There are over 200 actively enrolled students in the program and approximately 500 alumni. Istanbul Technical University Management Engineering Department offers a graduate degree, and a Ph.D. in Management Engineering. According to the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) PRISM Magazine (March 2008) the largest Master's of Engineering Management (MEM) programs (in terms of degrees awarded for 2005‚Äì2006) are shown in the following chart. File:Largest MEM Programs.jpg Management engineering consulting Large and small engineering driven firms often require the expertise of external management consultants that specialize in companies where engineering practice and product development are key drivers of value. Most engineering management consultants will have as a minimum a professional engineering qualification. But usually they will also have graduate degrees in engineering and or business or a management consulting designation. It involves providing management consulting service that is specific to professional engineering practice or to the engineering industry sector. Engineering management consultancies, are typically boutique firms and have a more specialized focus than the traditional mainstream consulting firms, A T Kearney, Boston Consulting Group, KPMG, PWC, and McKinsey. Applied science and engineering practice requires a holistic approach involving a combination of management art, science, and engineering practice. There are many professional service companies delivering services in a consultancy type relationship to the engineering industry, including law, accounting, human resources, marketing, politics, economics, finance, public affairs, and communication. Commonly, engineering management consultants are used when firms require a combination of special technical knowledge, and management know how, to enhance knowledge or transform organizational performance and also keep any intellectual property developed confidential. Engineering management consulting is concerned with the development, improvement, implementation and evaluation of integrated systems of organizations, people, money, knowledge, information, equipment, energy, materials and/or processes. Management Engineering Consultants strive to improve upon existing organizations, processes, products or systems. Engineering management consulting draws upon the principles and methods of engineering analysis and synthesis, as well as the mathematical, physical and social sciences together with the principles and methods of engineering design to specify, predict, and evaluate the results to be obtained from such systems or processes. Engineering management consulting can focus on the social impact of the product, process or system that is being analyzed. There is also an overlap between engineering management consulting and management science in services that require the adoption of more analytical approaches to problem solving. Examples of where engineering management consulting might be used include developing and leading a company wide business transformation initiative, or designing and implementing a new product development process, designing and implementing a manufacturing engineering process, including an automated assembly workstation. Management engineers may specialize in the acquisition and implementation of Computer aided design (CAD), Computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) and Computer-aided engineering (CAE) applications. Services may include strategizing for various operational logistics, new product introductions, or consulting as an efficiency expert. It may include using management science techniques to develop a new financial algorithm or loan system for a bank, streamlining operation and emergency room location or usage in a hospital, planning complex distribution schemes for materials or products (referred to as Supply Chain Management), and shortening lines (or queues) at a bank, hospital, or a theme park. Management engineering consultants typically use computer simulation (especially discrete event simulation), along with extensive mathematical tools and modeling and computational methods for system analysis, evaluation, and optimization. Professional organizations There are a number of societies and organizations dedicated to the field of engineering management. One of the largest societies is a division of IEEE, the Engineering Management Society, which regularly publishes a trade magazine. Another prominent professional organization in the field is the American Society for Engineering Management (ASEM), which was founded in 1979 by a group of 20 engineering managers from industry. ASEM currently certifies engineering managers (two levels) via the Certified Associate in Engineering Management (CAEM) or Certified Professional in Engineering Management (CPEM) certification exam. The Master of Engineering Management Programs Consortium is a consortium of nine universities intended to raise the value and visibility of the MEM degree.Master of Engineering Management Programs Consortium Also, engineering management graduate programs have the possibility of being accredited by ABET, ATMAE, or ASEM. In Canada, the Canadian Society for Engineering Management (CSEM) is a constituent society of the Engineering Institute of Canada (EIC), Canada's oldest learned engineering society.

The key North American skiers who popularized the sport include: Doug Coombs, Shane McConkey, Seth Morrison, Glen Plake and Scot Schmidt, all considered among the top extreme skiers in the world during their prime. Because of the extremely long, steep slopes, and dangerous terrain, single mistakes at the wrong moment by some extreme skiers have led to them being seriously injured or killed.

One gift was sufficient to completely equip and furnish a home for nurses. She was a co-founder in 1903 of the Animal Defence and Anti- Vivisection Society, with Lizzy Lind af Hageby, a society which set up three veterinary hospitals for horses during World War I, and campaigned against cruelty to animals including the use of animals in war. In 1912 she became a founder of the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Vivisection, which went on to become Advocates for Animals. She also established Ferne Animal Sanctuary, at Ferne House in Dorset, the estate she and her husband owned. She compiled an illustrated book related to the sanctuary called Chronicles of Ferne, published in 1951.

He was President of the Royal Academy from 1919 to 1924, and the founding Chairman of the London Society. Life The son of a watercolourist (and former pupil of the landscape artist David Cox), Edward Webb, Aston Webb was born in Clapham, south London, on 22 May 1849 and received his initial architectural training articled in the firm of Banks and Barry from 1866 to 1871, after which he spent a year travelling in Europe and Asia. He returned to London in 1874 to set up his own practice. From the early 1880s, he joined the Royal Institute of British Architects (1883) and began working in partnership with Ingress Bell (1836‚Äì1914). Their first major commission was a winning design for the Victoria Law Courts in Birmingham (1886), the first of numerous public building schemes the pair designed over the next 23 years. Towards the end of his career Webb was assisted by his sons, Maurice and Philip. Ralph Knott, who designed London's County Hall, began his work as an apprentice to Webb executing the drawings for his competition entries. He died in Kensington, London, on 21 August 1930. =Honours and awards= He served as RIBA President (1902‚Äì1904) and, having been elected as a full member of the Royal Academy in 1903, served as acting president from 1919 to 1924. He received the Royal Gold Medal for Architecture in 1905 and was the first recipient of the American Institute of Architects Gold Medal in 1907. He was the first chairman of the London Society in 1912.http://www.londonsocietyjournal.org.uk/ He was knighted in 1904, appointed a Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1909; and appointed to the Royal Victorian Order as Commander in 1911, promoted to Knight Commander in 1914 and Knight Grand Cross in 1925. Works Imperial College London Buckingham palace and Victoria memorial A drawing showing Plan of a Master's House, New Christ's Hospital (Webb and Bell). One of his earliest works was built for the Six Masters of The Royal Grammar School Worcester in 1877. These almshouses are in the Arts and Crafts style, different from his later work. In 1881 he designed North Breache Manor in Surrey. A small country house in the Tudor Gothic manner, but with Arts and Crafts detailing, it was one of the largest and most extravagant of his private contracts from this earlier period. Webb's first major work was the restoration of the medieval St Bartholomew-the-Great in Smithfield, London. His brother Edward Alfred Webb was the churchwarden at the time, and his association with the church probably helped the young architect get the job.Dungavell, The architectural career of Sir Aston Webb (London: University of London, Royal Holloway and New Bedford College), 1999 In London, Webb's best known works include the Queen Victoria Memorial and The Mall approach to, and the principal facade of, Buckingham Palace, which he re-designed in 1913. Webb also designed the Victoria and Albert Museum's main building (designed 1891, opened 1909), the Royal United Services Institute, Whitehall (1893‚Äì95), and ‚Äì as part of The Mall scheme ‚Äì Admiralty Arch (1908‚Äì09). He also designed the Britannia Royal Naval College, Devon, where Royal Naval officers are still trained. He enlarged and sympathetically restored the perpendicular Church of St John Baptist, Claines, Worcester, finishing in 1886. Nearby he was also responsible for the new church of St. George, consecrated in 1895, which replaced an earlier smaller building in St. George's Square, Barbourne, Worcester. With his partner Ingress Bell, he extended St Andrew's Church, in Fulham Fields, London, remodelled the chancel and built the Lady Chapel. Other educational commissions included the new buildings of Christ's Hospital in Horsham, Sussex (1893‚Äì1902), the Royal College of Science, South Kensington (1900‚Äì06), King's College, Cambridge (1908), the Royal School of Mines, South Kensington (1909‚Äì13), Royal Russell School, Coombe, Croydon, Surrey, and the Royal College of Science for Ireland which now houses the Irish Government Buildings. Residential commissions included Nos 2 (The Gables) and 4 (Windermere) Blackheath Park, in Blackheath, south-east London. He also designed (1895‚Äì96) a library wing, including the Cedar Library, at The Hendre, a large Victorian mansion in Monmouthshire, for John Allan Rolls, first Lord Llangattock. In March 1889 the consistory of the French Protestant Church of London commissioned (Sir) Aston Webb to design a new church.French Protestant Church of London It was erected in 1891‚Äì93 at 8‚Äì9 Soho Square in London. The church is one of Aston Webb's Gothic school works. In 1901 Aston Webb designed the headquarters for a brewery at 115 Tooley Street, London, recently converted into 14 apartments as \\"Aston Webb House\\". This was done as part of the development of More London. Weetman Pearson, 1st Viscount Cowdray, commissioned Webb to undertake major extensions to his property, Dunecht House, Aberdeenshire, which were carried out 1913‚Äì20. At the University of Birmingham (1900-1912), the whole of the original scheme, in the Byzantine style, was the product of the Webb-Bell partnership. This consisted of a curved building with five radial blocks. The central building of Chancellor's Court containing the Great Hall is named after Aston Webb. The main feature is a large dome that sits atop the entrance loggia. The two radial blocks to each side were to be teaching blocks for various engineering disciplines; but the easternmost was not built until the Bramall Music Building was added roughly a century later. The scheme also included the straight run of buildings to the north completing the 'D' shape. Originally these were the physics and chemistry departments, and the Harding Memorial Library. The scheme was set off by the free standing clock tower (\\"Old Joe\\") over 100 metres high and the tallest structure in Birmingham until 1966. In 1926 Sir Aston Webb designed the Chapel for Ellesmere College, Shropshire.

It is the tallest free-standing clock tower in the world, although its actual height is the subject of some confusion. The university lists it as , , and 100 metres (328 ft) tall, the last of which is supported by other sources. In a lecture in 1945, Mr C. G. Burton, secretary of the University, stated that \\"the tower stands high, the clock dials measure in diameter, the length of the clock hands are , and the bell weighs \\". The tower was built to commemorate Joseph Chamberlain, the first Chancellor of the University (with the commemoration being carved into the stone at the tower's base), although one of the original suggested names for the clock tower was the \\"Poynting Tower\\", after one of the earliest professors at the University, Professor John Henry Poynting. A prominent landmark in Birmingham, the grade II listed tower can be seen for miles around the campus, and has become synonymous with the University itself. History Queen Elizabeth Hospital Designed as part of the initial phase of the Edgbaston campus by architects Aston Webb and Ingress Bell, the tower was constructed between 1900‚Äì1908, and stood at the centre of a semicircle of matching red brick buildings. The tower is modelled on the Torre del Mangia in Siena. The original tower designs were amended due to Chamberlain's great admiration for the Italian city's campanile. On 1 October 1905, the Birmingham Post reported that Chamberlain had announced to the University Council an anonymous gift of ¬£50,000 (the donor in fact was Sir Charles Holcroft). This anonymous gift was announced some two months later in the Birmingham Post as \\"to be intended for the erection of a tower in connection with the new buildings at Bournbrook at a cost estimated by the architects at ¬£25,000. The tower, it was suggested, would be upwards of in height, and would not only form the main architectural feature of the University but would be useful in connection with the Physics Department and as a record tower.Cheesewright, 1975, p. 55 In 1940, Sir Mark Oliphant used the tower for radar experiments. The tower remained the tallest structure in Birmingham until 1965, when construction on the tall BT Tower was completed in the Jewellery Quarter area of the city. However, Old Joe is still one of the fifty tallest buildings in the UK. The asteroid 10515 Old Joe, discovered in 1989, is named in the clock tower's honour. There is a superstition that if students walk through the tower's archway when it chimes, that they will fail their degree. Description Another image of Old Joe Original design for Old Joe as inspired by St. Mark's Campanile, Venice. Interior view looking down from the 8th floor The base is solid concrete, square by thick, with foundations that extend below ground to ensure stability. Joyce of Whitchurch built the clock, the face of which is across, the largest bell weighs Great Bells of the British Isles, TowerBells Website, accessed 14 January 2015 with all the bells together weighing ; the minute hand is long, the hour hand is across, the pendulum is long. The clock hands are made out of sheet copper. There are ten floors served by an electrical lift in the SW corner.Cheesewright, 1975, p. 57 The tower was built from the inside, without scaffolding, up to the level of the balcony. It is built of Red Accrington brick with Darley Dale dressings and tapers from square to below the balcony.Braithwaite, 1987, p. 4 Owing to its having been built from the inside it was not pointed and had to be pointed in 1914 and was subsequently repointed in 1957 and 1984-85\\\\. Its weight, solid brick corners linked by four courses of brick resists the overturning wind forces. The original design for Old Joe is thought to have been based upon St Mark's Campanile in Venice, the latter having served as the inspiration for Sather Tower at University of California, Berkeley. The final design is thought to have been inspired by Torre del Mangia which is of similar design but for the clock being placed towards the bottom of the tower. David Lodge's novel Changing Places tells the story of exchange of professors between the universities of Rummidge and Euphoric State, Plotinus (thinly disguised fictional versions of Birmingham and Berkeley), which in the book both have replicas of the Leaning Tower of Pisa on campus. It is also said to have been inspiration for the Eye of Sauron in J.R.R Tolkien's Lord of the Rings due to the glowing clock face. However, 'The Two Towers themselves are widely accepted as having been inspired by Edgbaston Waterworks and Perrott's Folly which would both have been visible from Tolkien's home.

These subway cars were purchased for the IND division. A total of 500 R4s were built, numbered 400‚Äì899, and arranged as single units. They were practically identical to the R1s, which preceded them, except that the R4s had a slightly different side door panel than the R1, adding small handle notches below the door window. The R4s were used primarily for increased service in Queens, the Bronx, and Brooklyn. They served exclusively on all IND lines for most of their service lives, but were also used on the BMT Division during their final years. The R44s and R46s replaced the R4 cars, and they made their final runs in 1977. Four cars were preserved, and the rest were scrapped. History ACF built these cars between 1932 and 1933. The 500 R4s were numbered 400‚Äì899 to continue the R1's sequence of numbers. The R5 contract order was for trucks and motors for the R4 fleet. In 1932, each new car cost $30,633 for the car body under contract R4. The contract of subway cars was ordered to equip extensions of the IND in Queens, the Bronx, and Brooklyn. The R4s were used for service on the IND exclusively until 1972 or 1973. Most R4s were retired between 1972 and 1973 as age decayed the cars' internal components, causing the cars to perform worse than their newer contemporaries. Many were replaced by the R44s. Other cars were salvaged and renumbered with number plates taken from retired R6, R7, R7A, and R9 cars and transferred to the East New York Yard. They ran on the Eastern Division until 1977, when they were finally replaced by the R46s. Preservation Most of the cars were scrapped after retirement. However, four examples have been preserved: * Car 401 has been preserved by Railway Preservation Corp. and restored. This car contains two side doors that were previously used on R1 car 175, which lack the small handle notches below the door window. * Car 484 has been preserved by the New York Transit Museum and restored. This car was one of the two cars that were outfitted with \\"bullseye\\" lighting and an experimental PA system. * Car 800 has been preserved by the Seashore Trolley Museum in Kennebunkport, Maine. The car is modified with trolley poles and used in various trips at their museum, often coupled to R7 car 1440. * Car 825 has been preserved at the Trolley Museum of New York in Kingston, New York. It is currently undergoing a full cosmetic restoration with a planned completion date for April 2019. Experimental Refits * In 1946, 744 and 484 were outfitted with \\"bullseye\\" lighting and an experimental PA system. * In 1962, 467 became the first of the first-generation IND subway cars to be retrofitted with sealed beam headlights.

Career  After being called to the bar, Hanmer is recorded as having served as advocate in a case involving a breach of contract between a lessor and the lessee regarding the lessor's failure to make proper repairs to the leased property. In 1376, Hanmer was appointed a serjeant-at-law. As a contemporary of Chaucer, a rough portrait of Hanmer as a serjeant-at-law may be found in Chaucer's depiction of the Sergeant of the Lawe in the Canterbury Tales. In 1377, Hanmer was elevated to the position of King's Serjeant. He served the Crown in that capacity as a legal adviser to Richard II and Richard's government, represented the king in court, served as a prosecutor in criminal cases and a representative in civil ones, and held a higher rank and power in the lower courts.Alexander Pulling, The Order of the Coif, William Clows & Sons Ltd. (1884), reprinted Classics in Legal History 28, Buffalo: W.S. Hein 1975), p 40 In his first year as a King's Serjeant, Hanmer sat in Parliament with Sir John Cavendish and others of the judiciary in judgment on a case involving a grant of the late king's grant to the widowed Countess of Huntingdon, said by some to have been Elizabeth of Lancaster, but was more probably the widow of the famous Guichard d'Angle. On 26 February 1383, Hanmer was appointed the sole Justice of the King's Bench.W. Betham. The baronetage of England, or The History of the English baronets 1805, p 426. The position was one of the highest to which an attorney could aspire. From 1383 through 1387, Hanmer was summoned to and sat in Parliament as one of the triers of petitions in the House of Lords. Hanmer's fellow triers included Thomas of Woodstock, Constable of England; Henry le Despenser, Bishop of Norwich; Walter Baron Fitzwalter (d. 1386); and Baron Cobham of Kent (d. 1408). Other triers of petitions included John Bokyngham, Bishop of Lincoln, and Robert de Vere, Earl of Oxford. David Hanmer was knighted by Richard II in 1387. His name ceased to appear amongst the judges toward the end of that year, and he was certainly dead by 1388, pursuant to a deed of that year concerning his widow Angharad, Lady Hanmer, which names their son-in-law, Owain Glynd≈µr, as the trustee for Sir David's estate.  Forebears and family  Following the death of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, last sovereign Prince of Wales, and the subsequent conquest of Wales, Sir Thomas de Macclesfield (b. 1242), an officer of Edward I, received a grant of lands in Maelor Saesneg (now part of the Wrexham County Borough). Sir Thomas and his heirs also received grants of lands near \\"Cronemoss\\" (Cronymoor) in Hanmer, from which the family eventually took its name. He and his successors married Welsh heiresses through whom the family acquired more estates in Hanmer, Bettisfield, Halton, and Pentrepant in the parish of Sylatyn, near Oswestry. Sir Thomas's oldest son, Jordan, inherited family lands in Worthenbury, whilst his younger son, John of Upton (1277-1309), Constable of Caernarfon Castle, resided at and inherited Hanmer and was the first to use the family surname.Jacob Youde William Lloyd, History of the Princes, the Lords Marcher and the Ancient Nobility of Powys Fadog, vol. 2 (1882) pp 152, 374 John married Hawis ferch Einion, a descendant of the Welsh rulers of mid-Wales; Hawis's grandfather was Gruffudd (d. 1286) ap Gwenwynwyn (d. 1216) ab Owain Cyfeiliog, prince of Powys. Hawis's paternal grandmother and namesake was a daughter of John Lestrange of Knockin, from whose family Sir David's son-in-law, Owain Glynd≈µr, descended. David's father was Philip Hanmer (b. 1305), son of John and Hawis, through whom David and his famous son-in-law were distantly related.R.R. Davis, The Revolt of Owain Glyn Dwr, (Oxford University Press: 1995) Another familial connection between the Hanmers and Owain Glynd≈µr was through David's mother, Nest, daughter of Dafydd ap Rhirid ab Ynyr ab Ionas of Maelor Saesneg (English Maelor). Nest's paternal forebear, Ionas, was an illegitimate son of Goronwy ap Tudor ap Rhys Sais, whose descendants, the sons of Tudor ap Goronwy of Anglesea, were first cousins and prominent supporters of Owain Glynd≈µr. Thus, Sir David and his famous son-in-law were related by blood several times over.John Lord Hanmer, A memorial of the parish and family of Hanmer in Flintshire Chiswick Press (London:1876), pp 23-27 David married Angharad, daughter of Llywelyn Ddu ap Gruffudd ab Iorwerth Foel of Pengwen, a landowner in nearby Chirkland. Angharad bore David at least four children: three sons, Gruffudd, Philip, and John (b.c.1362), and a daughter, Margaret, or Marred, (b.c.1370). All four of David's children were most certainly Welsh-speaking, as well as fluent in French, and possibly, to a lesser degree, in English. David Hanmer may have had the wardship of Owain Glynd≈µr when the latter's father died in his youth.Sir John E. Lloyd. Owen Glendower (Owain Glynd≈µr (Oxford:1931) Gruffudd, the eldest, an attorney, was appointed by his brother-in-law as acting legal advisor to the Principality of North Wales; he married Gwerfyl ferch Tudor ap Goronwy, an aunt of Owen Tudor, by whom he had a daughter named Angharad. Philip, the second son, was also probably a lawyer. John was appointed to several responsible posts in the government of Flintshire; he married, first, Margaret ferch Dafydd ap Bleddyn Fychan, by whom he had a son, Gruffydd, from whom descended the Hanmer baronets; his second wife was Efa ferch Dafydd ap Goronwy, by whom he had three sons, John, Richard, and Edward.

Lianas in Udawattakele, Sri Lanka A canopy of Entada gigas that has formed over a monkey ladder vine (Bauhinia glabra) on Kauai, Hawaii. Liana tangle across a forest in the Western Ghats A liana is a long-stemmed, woody vine that is rooted in the soil at ground level and uses trees, as well as other means of vertical support, to climb up to the canopy in search of direct sunlight. Lianas are characteristic of tropical moist deciduous forests (especially seasonal forests), but may be found in temperate rainforests and temperate deciduous forests. There are also temperate lianas, for example the members of the Clematis or Vitis (wild grape) genera. Lianas can form bridges amidst the forest canopy, providing arboreal animals with paths across the forest. These bridges can protect weaker trees from strong winds. Lianas compete with forest trees for sunlight, water and nutrients from the soil. Forests without lianas grow 150% more fruit; trees with lianas have twice the probability of dying. The word liana does not refer to a taxonomic grouping, but rather a habit of plant growth ‚Äì much like tree or shrub. It comes from standard French liane, itself from an Antilles French dialect word meaning to sheave. Lianas may be found in many different plant families. One way of distinguishing lianas from trees and shrubs is based on the stiffness, specifically, the Young's modulus of various parts of the stem. Trees and shrubs have young twigs and smaller branches which are quite flexible and older growth such as trunks and large branches which are stiffer. A liana often has stiff young growths and older, more flexible growth at the base of the stem. Ecology Lianas compete intensely with trees, greatly reducing tree growth and tree reproduction, greatly increasing tree mortality, preventing tree seedlings from establishing, altering the course of regeneration in forests, and ultimately affecting tree population growth rates. Lianas also provide access routes in the forest canopy for many arboreal animals, including ants and many other invertebrates, lizards, rodents, sloths, monkeys, and lemurs. For example, in the Eastern tropical forests of Madagascar, many lemurs achieve higher mobility from the web of lianas draped amongst the vertical tree species. Many lemurs prefer trees with lianas for their roost sites. Lianas also provide support for trees when strong winds blow. However, they may be destructive in that when one tree falls, the connections made by the lianas may cause many other trees to fall. As noted by Charles Darwin, because lianas are supported by other plants, they may conserve resources that other plants must allocate to the development of structure and use them instead for growth and reproduction. In general, lianas are detrimental to the trees that support them. Growth rates are lower for trees with lianas; they directly damage hosts by mechanical abrasion and strangulation, render hosts more susceptible to ice and wind damage, and increase the probability that the host tree falls. Lianas also make the canopy of trees more accessible to animals which eat leaves. Because of these negative effects, trees which remain free of lianas are at an advantage; some species have evolved characteristics which help them avoid or shed lianas. Examples Some families and genera containing liana species include: References External links * 'Vines and Lianas' by Rhett Butler, at http://rainforests.mongabay.com/0406.htm * * Category:Plant morphology Category:Biology terminology Category:Plant life-form Category:Plants by habit ","title":"Liana"},{"id":"551450","text":"A bioship is a type of spacecraft or starship described in science fiction.  Description  Bioships differ from other types of spacecraft in that they are composed, either predominantly or totally, of biological components, rather than being constructed from manufactured materials. Because of this, they nearly always have a distinctively organic look. Bioships are usually quite powerful, and can often regenerate or heal damaged parts. Some bioships are intelligent or sentient, and some are considered to be lifeforms. Like most organic beings, many bioships contain large amounts of \\"scaffolding\\" materials to keep their shape, such as the xylem in trees or bone and chitin in animals. In fiction In the science fiction short story \\"Specialist\\" by Robert Sheckley, published in 1953 in Galaxy magazine, it is revealed that many galactic races are actually capable of symbiotic cooperation to become bioships, with each race forming a different part. Earth, apparently, is one of the planets inhabited by creatures that are supposed to function as FTL (faster than light) drives (Pushers), and, it is stated that all the conflicts and discontent of humanity are due to the fact that, while they have matured, they have nowhere to apply their true purpose. This story is perhaps the first mention of a bioship in science fiction.Noel Keyes, editor Contact: Man Faces Extraterrestrial Life New York:1963 Paperback Library, Inc. \\"Specialist\\" by Robert Sheckley (1953) Pages 153-166 Volume 322 of the German Perry Rhodan magazine series, first published in November 1967, marks another very early appearance of the bioship concept in science fiction. The Dolans are powerful bioengineered combat spaceships that are grown from the same synthetic genetic material as their extraterrestrial commanders.Perrypedia vol. 322: Ein Gigant erwacht (A Giant Awakes) (German)Schematic of a Dolan Archived Different types of bioships are a recurrent feature in later stages of the Perry Rhodan universe. The Night's Dawn Trilogy: the Edenist Voidhawk and Mercenary Blackhawk are both advanced bioships (the latter being a genetic tailoring for combat of the former). Both types employ mental bonding to the captain. In the case of Voidhawks this is done by both the craft and captain gestating together and maintaining mental contact during their formative years. Blackhawks however are purchased as eggs and are bonded to the buyer who will become captain when the Blackhawk matures.Hamilton, Peter F. (1996). The Reality Dysfunction. Pan Books (UK). In the first novel of Julian May's Pliocene series, The Many-Colored Land (1982), the backstory of two races of alien refugees living in the Earth's Pliocene epoch describes their hard landing in a bioship. The bioship was emotionally bonded to one of the aliens (the \\"shipwife\\") and sacrificed its own life to safely deliver its passengers to the planet surface.May, J. C. (1982). The Many-coloured Land. New York, NY: Tor Books. . On Babylon 5 , many of the First Ones used organic ships, like the Vorlon and Shadows races. Use of organic technology by these races signified their significant advancement over the younger races since their ships are very resilient, generate their own power, very maneuverable, have devastatingly powerful weapons (including variants that are capable of destroying planets), regenerate, and have a measure of intelligence. In the popular science fiction franchise Star Trek several bioships appear. The Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \\"Tin Man\\" features a bioship as the main part of the plot. Species 8472 also has an enormous fleet of bioships which are able to go toe to toe with, arguably the Federation's most malignant enemy, The Borg. In the fictional universe of Warhammer 40,000, an extragalactic race known as the tyranids (who swarm entire planets and consume all available biomass to reproduce and further spread to other planets) travel through the galaxy using giant organic bioships known as hive ships that transport the various types of the race inside. These ships travel in large numbers known as hive fleets and are often described as \\"tendrils\\" weaving into the galaxy from other galaxies they had previously devoured. Numerous hive fleets have been recorded in the 40K universe and have even been named, with the first recorded fleet designated as Hive Fleet Behemoth. The hive ships are described as serving their race as a whole and the individuals within a hive ship serving it as a single entity. The Zerg alien race in the video game StarCraft traverse space via sentient, organic vessels called \\"Leviathan\\". Farscape's Moya is a female Leviathan transport vessel; a living sentient bio-mechanical space ship, who was once captured by the Peacekeepers. She escaped captivity along with the people imprisoned on her by the Peacekeepers. She has given birth to one offspring, a male by the name of Talyn.

Academic work Kinbote appears to be the scholarly author of the Foreword, Commentary and Index surrounding the text of the late John Shade's poem \\"Pale Fire\\", which together form the text of Nabokov's novel. In the course of initially academic but increasingly deranged annotations to Shade's text, Kinbote's writing reveals a comic melange of narcissism and megalomania: he believes himself to be a royal figure, the exiled king of Zembla and the real target of the gunman who has in fact murdered Shade. Using the scholarly apparatus of reference and commentary, Kinbote first intertwines his own story with the commentary on Shade's poem, then allows the poem to slide into the background and his perhaps delusional world to move into the spotlight; as Kinbote had hoped John Shade would produce a poem about Zembla's exiled king, this shift provides some satisfaction for Kinbote. Zembla Kinbote's \\"distant northern land\\" may or may not exist in the world of the novel. In one interpretation, Kinbote is in fact a failed Eastern European academic probably named Vseslav Botkin, teaching at the same university as Shade. Botkin is desperate for recognition, ridiculed by most of the staff. Shade alone feels pity for him, and occasionally indulges Kinbote in long walks around New Wye, the college town where they live. Structure and Pale Fire's author The reflexive structure of the novel, in which neither Kinbote nor Shade can really have the last word, together with apparent allusions to Kinbote's story in the poem, allow critics to argue various theories of authorship for Pale Fire as a whole, including the theory that Shade invented Kinbote and wrote the commentary himself, and the contrasting theory that Kinbote invented Shade. Brian Boyd's book Pale Fire: The Magic of Artistic Discovery thoroughly explores the authorship and interpretive options, eventually settling on a thesis involving intervention in the text by both Shade and his daughter Hazel after their respective deaths. Mary McCarthy, in her 1962 New Republic essay \\"A Bolt from the Blue\\" (in which she classed Pale Fire \\"one of the great works of art of the century\\") identified the book's author as Professor V.

The village lies under the north slope of Salisbury Plain and the parish extends south onto the Plain. Tinhead is the former name of the eastern half of present-day Edington, towards Coulston along the B3098 Westbury ‚Äì Market Lavington road. Tinhead is labelled on the Ordnance Survey map of 1945 but not on the 1958 map. Today the combined settlement is Edington and the name survives only in Tinhead Hill and Tinhead Lane.  History  Evidence of prehistoric activity includes a long barrow at Tinhead Hill. The parish was part of the hundred of Whorwellsdown, and is believed to hold a place in English history, for it was probably here that King Alfred the Great won a decisive battle in 878 against the Danes at the Battle of Edington (formerly known as the Battle of Ethandun). In the year 957 the Witenagemot, or King's Council, met at Edington. The Domesday Book of 1086 records a large settlement of 67 households, held by Romsey Abbey. The manor, known as Edington Romsey, continued to be held by the abbey until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century. Edington Priory was founded in the 14th century and became a monastery of the Brothers of Penitence, or Bonshommes. Its large church continues in use as the parish church of St Mary, St Katherine and All Saints but the other monastery buildings were destroyed by 1579; part of a fishpond survives. Three miles away is the Westbury White Horse, a famous chalk figure on the side of Westbury Hill first recorded in the 18th century, which is visible from Westbury and much of western Wiltshire, although not from Edington. A Methodist chapel was built in 1828 and a schoolroom added in 1876; it closed in 2006. The Stert & Westbury Railway was built across the parish by the Great Western Railway Company, opening in 1900. A station named Edington and Bratton was half a mile (800 metres) north of Edington. The track continues in use as part of the Reading to Taunton Line but the station closed to passengers in 1952 and to goods in 1963; the station yard is a small industrial estate.  Local government  The civil parish elects a parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which performs all significant local government functions. The population of the parish was 834 at the census of 1801 and 1,136 in 1841. It had fallen back to 714 in 1931 and in 1951 it was down to 579, partly due to the civil parish having been reduced in area in 1934, with the hamlet of West Coulston being united with East Coulston.  Notable people  William Edington (d. 1366), from an Edington family, became Treasurer of England and bishop of Winchester, and founded and endowed the monastery at Edington. William Gullick, the man who designed the New South Wales Coat of Arms, was baptised here in 1858.  Amenities  The village is some six miles from the county town of Trowbridge, which, with Devizes and Westbury, provides shopping facilities. Edington has a village common and a public house, the Three Daggers. The parish church is the home of the nationally-known annual Edington Music Festival.

Oerlikon Contraves was a Swiss anti-aircraft artillery manufacturer famous for its adaptation of the 1916 20 mm Becker as the Oerlikon 20 mm autocannon design, which was used in the Second World War and still in use today. Copies and derivatives of these designs were made by German, French, British and Japanese weapon manufacturers.

The group's sales were about . History Oerlikon's earliest predecessor was Schweizerische Werkzeugmaschinenfabrik Oerlikon, founded in the Oerlikon district of Zurich, Switzerland in 1906. In 1923 it acquired a factory in Germany. It entered the anti-aircraft defence field in 1924. In 1936, it founded a purely anti-aircraft development company called Contraves (contra aves is Latin for \\"against birds\\", better translated as \\"anti-flying- objects\\") In 1989, the Werkzeugmaschinenfabrik Oerlikon-B√ºhrle and Contraves merged to form the Oerlikon-Contraves Group, later renamed Oerlikon Contraves Defence.

Originally used as anti- aircraft weapons by the US Navy, they were frequently the last line of defence against kamikaze attacks. Most combat ships from aircraft carriers to PT boats were equipped with Oerlikon guns. During the Vietnam War they were widely employed by riverine forces as anti-personnel weapons. They remained in service until the 1970s, when they were replaced by the Mk 16 20 mm cannon. Oerlikon also developed the following surface-to-air missiles: the RSA Missile, the RSD 58, and the Kriens RSC Missile.

Corruption charges Rheinmetall Air Defence (RAD) is one of six companies that were blacklisted by India's Ministry of Defence in March 2012 for their involvement in a bribery scandal. The companies are accused of bribing the Director General of Ordnance Factories Board (OFB), Sudipta Ghosh. RAD and the other firms have been barred from any dealings with the OFB and all other Indian defence companies, as well as being blacklisted from participating in any Indian defence contract, for a period of 10 years. RAD has claimed that the charges against it are without merit. Rheinmetall Air Defence was implicated in a corruption case in India along with arms dealer Abhishek Verma and his wife Anca Verma lodged by anti-corruption agency of India, the CBI in 2012 for bribing defence officials for securing multi billion dollar weapons contracts of the Indian military establishment. RAD Chairman Bodo Garbe and General Manager Gerhard Hoy were issued summons of the Indian courts. Subsequently a red-corner notice was issued for their detention through Interpol. The case at present is under trial in Indian courts.

He is known for his energetic performances, schoolboy-uniform stage outfits and his own version of Chuck Berry's duckwalk. Young was ranked 24th in Rolling Stone magazine's 100 greatest guitarists of all-time list. In 2003, Young and the other members of AC/DC were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Early life Young's father, William Young (born 16 February 1911) and his family lived at 6 Skerryvore Road in the Cranhill district of Glasgow in Scotland. William worked first as a wheel boy in a rope works and then as a machine / saw operator in an asbestos / cement business. In 1940 William joined the Royal Air Force serving in World War 2 as a flight engine mechanic. After the war William worked as a yard man for a builder and then as a postman. His wife Margaret (born 14 July 1913; maiden name also Young) was a housewife. The 'big freeze' of 1963 was the worst winter on record in Scotland with snow eight feet deep. A TV advertisement at the same time offered assisted travel for families for a different life in Australia. 15 members of the Young family left Scotland by aeroplane in late June 1963 including fifth son, George (6 November 1946 ‚Äì 22 October 2017), and younger brothers, Malcolm (6 January 195318 November 2017) and Angus (born 31 March 1955). Also aboard were his eldest brother Stephen (24 June 19331989), his only sister, Margaret Horsburgh (2 May 1935 ‚Äì 2019) and brother, William Jr (born 15 December 1940). Another elder brother, Alex (28 December 19381997), stayed in the UK, and was later a member of London-based group, Grapefruit. A final brother, John Young (born 17 May 1937), had migrated to Australia separately. Malcolm later described the family's musical background, \\"All the males in our family played, Stevie, the oldest played accordion, Alex and John were the first couple to play guitar, and being older it was sort of passed down to George, then myself, then Angus.\\" His oldest brother Stevie was the father of Stevie Young who in later years took over from Malcolm in AC/DC. Initially staying at Villawood Migrant Hostel (a site later developed as Villawood Immigration Detention Centre) in Nissen huts, George Young met and became friends with another migrant, Harry Vanda. The Young family moved into a semi detached house at 4 Burleigh Street in the Sydney suburb of Burwood. Young dropped out of Ashfield Boys High School at age 15. Young first started playing on a banjo, re-strung with six strings. He first started playing guitar on a cheap acoustic model purchased second-hand by his mother. His first Gibson SG was bought second-hand around 1970 from a music shop just down the street from his home: \\"I got out and got a Gibson SG that I played until it got wood rot because so much sweat and water got into it. The whole neck warped. I bought it second-hand; it was about a '67. It had a real thin neck, really slim, like a Custom neck. It was dark brown.\\" Career Young live with AC/DC in 1982 at the Manchester Apollo Both Angus and Malcolm Young were in a band with their brother George and his music partner Harry Vanda called Marcus Hook Roll Band. The project released an album in Australia called Tales of Old Grand Daddy. Prior to forming AC/DC, Angus Young played in a local group called Kantuckee. Kantuckee's line-up included Bob McGlynn (vocals), Angus Young (guitar), Jon Stevens (bass), and Trevor James (drums). The band split and was later called Tantrum with the following line up: Mark Sneddon (vocals-guitar), Angus Young (guitar), Jon Stevens (bass) and Trevor James (drums). Young was 18 when he and older brother Malcolm formed AC/DC in 1973. Angus was on lead guitar, Malcolm on rhythm guitar, Colin Burgess on drums, Larry Van Kriedt on bass guitar and Dave Evans on vocals. \\"Can I Sit Next To You Girl,\\" their first single, was later re-recorded with Bon Scott as their vocalist. They decided upon the name AC/DC, suggested by their sister Margaret, who saw the letters \\"AC/DC\\" on the back of her sewing machine. Young tried a number of stage costumes, such as Spider-Man, Zorro, a gorilla, and a parody of Superman, named Super-Ang, before settling on his signature schoolboy look at the suggestion of his sister. To match this image the press and public were told that Young was born in 1959, not 1955. The original uniform was created by his sister Margaret and when it fell apart from wear and tear, he used his uniform from Ashfield Boys High School in Sydney. AC/DC released their debut album, High Voltage, on 17 February 1975. Over the next three years AC/DC cemented themselves as a popular hard rock act, especially in Australia, with the follow-up albums, T.N.T., Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, Let There Be Rock and Powerage. All their albums until this point were produced by Young's brother George in partnership with Harry Vanda. Their 1979 studio album, Highway to Hell, became their best-selling at the time and launched them to new heights of fame. Months after this, Scott died from alcohol poisoning. Questions were raised as to whether the band could continue without him. Young and his other bandmates soon decided they should finish the work they had begun for their new album, so they recruited ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson to replace Scott. Five months later, Back in Black was released as a tribute to Scott. It quickly became a huge success, far outselling any of their previous albums, and going on to reach 22x multi-platinum in the US alone, and selling 50 million copies, the second highest-selling album worldwide, behind only Michael Jackson's Thriller. AC/DC's next album, For Those About to Rock We Salute You, cemented their position as the most popular hard rock act of the time. AC/DC's popularity declined with their next three albums, Flick of the Switch, Fly on the Wall and Blow Up Your Video. AC/DC looked as though they had reached their peak early in the decade and by the end of it were in decline. Malcolm Young missed the majority of AC/DC's Blow Up Your Video World Tour to address his drinking problem. He eventually became sober and returned to the band. During his absence he was replaced by his nephew, Stevie Young. However, their 1990 studio album, The Razors Edge, brought them back into the spotlight, reaching 5x multi-platinum in the US alone and selling between 10 and 12 million copies worldwide. Over the next 10 years AC/DC released two other studio albums, Ballbreaker and Stiff Upper Lip, which confirmed their renewed popularity and success. After a lengthy eight- year hiatus, AC/DC returned with a new studio album, Black Ice. Black Ice debuted at number 1 in 29 countries and was certified multi-platinum in 14 of those, becoming one of their most successful albums worldwide, and was followed by a hugely successful world tour. In 2010, AC/DC released an album of songs used for the Iron Man 2 soundtrack they had put together; this reached number one in many countries around the world, including the UK, and number four in the US. Malcolm Young confirmed in 2011 that AC/DC were working on a 16th studio album. In April 2014 Malcolm Young was forced to leave the band due to ill health, leaving Angus the last consistent member of the band. In May it was revealed that Stevie Young, Malcolm and Angus's nephew, would stand in for his uncle to record AC/DC's latest record. In September Malcolm officially retired and Stevie was made AC/DC's official full-time rhythm guitarist. AC/DC released Rock or Bust in the fall of 2014. In March 2016, after the departure of both Malcolm Young and drummer Phil Rudd, AC/DC was set back with yet another departure; long time lead singer Brian Johnson was ordered by doctors to stop performing or face total hearing loss. Angus, determined to finish what the band started, recruited Guns N' Roses singer Axl Rose to stand in for Johnson for the remainder of the Rock or Bust World Tour. On September 30, 2020, the band's official Twitter account announced the pending release of a new album titled \\"PWRUP,\\" with the lineup of Angus Young, Stevie Young, Brian Johnson, Cliff Williams and Phil Rudd. https://twitter.com/acdc/status/1311274601637240832 In 2003, AC/DC were inducted into the Rock and Roll hall of fame and the following year they were ranked number 72 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \\"100 greatest artists of all time.\\" VH1 ranked them number 23 on their list of the \\"100 greatest artists of all time\\" and number 4 in their list of the \\"100 greatest artists of hard rock.\\" Personal life Young is married to a Dutch woman named Ellen van Lochem. They own homes in Australia, the UK, and the Netherlands. Although a heavy smoker, Young is a teetotaler and has been all his life. He is a supporter of Rangers FC. On 24 August 2006, Young received Kerrang! magazine's Legend Award from the editor, Paul Brannigan, who called AC/DC \\"one of the most important and influential rock bands in history\\". On 16 May 2012, he was named the \\"Best Australian Guitarist of All Time\\" in a poll conducted by Australian Guitar Magazine. Equipment =Guitars= Stiff Upper Lip tour in Germany Young has used Gibson SGs in various forms (his original, and the basis for his current signature model, was a 1968 - '70 SG Standard) throughout his career. He also used a modified version of the SG called the Jaydee SG, which was made custom for Young by Jaydee guitars. At least two of his SGs (whether modified Gibson product or ground-up construction) circa 1977 and the Paris \\"Let There Be Rock\\" tapings featured on-board wireless going to his amplifiers, the circuitry installed in a cavity routed into the back of the body. This practice was discontinued due to the potential for electrical shorts due to sweat, and at least one of these guitars would be repaired and used for the Rock or Bust tour. The Jaydee SG featured signature lightning bolt inlays on the fretboard. Gibson made a custom SG for Young with lightning bolt inlays to replace the Jaydee SG. Young's '68 - '70 SG has T Top pick-ups. Another 1964 SG that he used on the recording of Ballbreaker, has patent # pick-ups. All of these are vintage-output Alnico II or V pick-ups with matched coils typically reading 7.5k ohm. Beginning in 2009, Young started fitting Seymour Duncan humbuckers to all of his touring guitars. He uses Ernie Ball Super Slinky guitar strings (.009-.042) and Fender \\"Extra Heavy\\" picks. =Angus Young SG= Young and Gibson Guitar Corporation have collaborated to make the Angus Young SG. It features a pick-up designed by Young himself (the Angus Young Signature Humbucker) in the bridge position, and a '57 Classic Humbucker in the neck. The neck has \\"lightning bolt\\" inlays. =Amplifiers= Young mainly uses Marshall 1959 100 watt Super Lead Plexi heads and model 1960 AX and BX 4x12 cabinets with Celestion G12-65 speakers. Later amplifiers included Marshall JMP 2203 and most recently, Wizard Amplifiers. Early wireless systems, the Schaffer-Vega Diversity System that he would begin using in 1977, was also used as a compressor and a booster in his signal to \\"fatten up\\" his tone. Ever since adding it to his rig, it was used on several albums in the studio for chosen rhythm guitar tracks and all lead guitar tracks. Beginning with Rock or Bust, due to the discontinuation of the Schaffer system, Young began using a replica of the unit's preamp with a commercial wireless unit from Shure. Contrary to popular belief, Angus and Malcolm have both stated in guitar enthusiast magazine interviews that very little pre- gain, if any, is used on the amps and the distortion comes from simply using a heavier right-hand attack on the strings. Influence Young has stated that he first began playing guitar when he was \\"little, teeny. I would sort of dabble around five or six years old. That's when I started hearing Little Richard.\\" In an interview with The Guitar Show, Young noted his influences include his brother Malcolm Young, Chuck Berry, Freddie King, and Muddy Waters, while playing licks relating to Jimi Hendrix, Pete Townshend, John Lee Hooker, and The Kinks' \\"You Really Got Me\\". Young has indicated that he was also influenced by Keith Richards, as well as Chuck Berry's performing style, including his banter with audiences and duck walk.The Guitar Show television documentary, Segment: \\"Upfront with AC/DC's Angus Young\\", 2001. When the band covered Chuck Berry songs in their early years, audiences would recognise the song, while noting their renditions were very different from the source material. Style Let There Be Rock\\" Young's playing style is influenced by straight blues playing in both the minor and major pentatonic twelve bar blues-type progressions. In AC/DC's earlier recordings, power chords can be heard in songs such as \\"T.N.T.\\" and \\"It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)\\". He also utilises touches of Scottish folk in his playing, and pull-off arpeggios (pull-offs played one-handed) are a popular trick, appearing in songs such as \\"Who Made Who\\", \\"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap\\", \\"Sin City\\", and live renditions of \\"Let There Be Rock\\". In 1976, the band recorded an instrumental arrangement of the Scottish traditional song \\"Loch Lomond\\", retitled \\"Fling Thing\\", which has appeared in their stage act over the years. The title refers to the Highland Fling. Young occasionally provides backing vocals along with Malcolm on songs such as \\"T.N.T.\\" and \\"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap\\". Young onstage in 2009 A common criticism of AC/DC is that their songs are excessively simple and formulaic. In reply, Young stated in an interview with the Atlanta Gazette in 1979: \\"It's just rock and roll. A lot of times we get criticised for it. A lot of music papers come out with: 'When are they going to stop playing these three chords?' If you believe you shouldn't play just three chords it's pretty silly on their part. To us, the simpler a song is, the better, 'cause it's more in line with what the person on the street is.\\" Young is famous for his wild onstage antics, such as intense jumps and running back and forth across the stage. Once, he would clamber onto Bon Scott's or Brian Johnson's shoulders during concerts and they would make their way through the audience with smoke streaming from a satchel on Young's back, while he played an extended improvised guitar solo, usually during the song \\"Rocker\\" with Scott or \\"Let There Be Rock\\" with Johnson. He frequently does his own version of Chuck Berry's duck walk, as well as a \\"spasm\\" during which he throws himself to the ground, kicking, shaking, and spinning in circles while playing the guitar. Young was advised by older brother George that, if he ever tripped over his guitar cable, to keep playing and make it look like part of the act. Young also included a sort of striptease as part of a mid- show ritual, during which he slowly took off his schoolboy outfit, running across the stage to elicit cheers from the audience, culminating in a \\"mooning\\" gesture to expose his underwear, generally chosen with the colours of the local flag or occasionally offering a brief glimpse of his bare buttocks. He would then grab his guitar and play the remainder of the show topless. According to AC/DC video director David Mallet, although Young performs many of his trademark feats sometimes from a series of platforms, risers, and ramps, he suffers from a fear of heights; this was discovered when Mallet chose to have Young lowered from a second story balcony onto a stage floor by wires for the video for \\"Who Made Who\\".Interview: Hard as a Rock (video) Discography * High Voltage (1975, Australia only) * T.N.T.

Though first published in the journal Botteghe Oscure in 1951, it was written in 1947 when Thomas was in Florence with his family. It was published, along with other stories previously written, as part of Thomas' In Country Sleep, And Other Poems of 1952. The poem was also included in Collected Poems, 1934‚Äì1952, first published by Dent in 1952. It has been suggested that the poem was written for Thomas' dying father, although he did not die until just before Christmas 1952.* It has no title other than its first line, \\"Do not go gentle into that good night\\", a line that appears as a refrain throughout the poem along with its other refrain, \\"Rage, rage against the dying of the light\\". The poem currently remains under copyright, although the text is available online.  Form  The villanelle consists of five stanzas of three lines (tercets) followed by a single stanza of four lines (a quatrain) for a total of nineteen lines.Strand et al. 2001 p. 7 It is structured by two repeating rhymes and two refrains: the first line of the first stanza serves as the last line of the second and fourth stanzas, and the third line of the first stanza serves as the last line of the third and fifth stanzas. The rhyme-and-refrain pattern of Do not go gentle into that good night can be schematized as A1bA2 abA1 abA2 abA1 abA2 abA1A2 where letters (\\"a\\" and \\"b\\") indicate the two rhyme sounds, upper case indicates a refrain (\\"A\\"), and superscript numerals (1 and 2) indicate Refrain 1 and Refrain 2. See scheme below. :Refrain 1 (A1) :Line 2 (b) :Refrain 2 (A2) :Line 4 (a) :Line 5 (b) :Refrain 1 (A1) :Line 7 (a) :Line 8 (b) :Refrain 2 (A2) :Line 10 (a) :Line 11 (b) :Refrain 1 (A1) :Line 13 (a) :Line 14 (b) :Refrain 2 (A2) :Line 16 (a) :Line 17 (b) :Refrain 1 (A1) :Refrain 2 (A2)  Notable use in popular culture  * \\"Do not go gentle into that good night\\" was used as the text for the 1954 In Memoriam Dylan Thomas (Dirge-Canons and Song) for tenor and chamber ensemble, by Igor Stravinsky.
