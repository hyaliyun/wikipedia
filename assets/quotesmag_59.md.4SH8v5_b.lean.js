The Soviets' objective was to destroy the Mujahideen logistic base situated at Zhawar, 3 kilometers from the Pakistani border. Zhawar The Zhawar caves in 2002. The Mujahideen base at Zhawar, situated in Paktia Province, served as a storage facility for supplies and equipment being transferred from neighbouring Pakistan to the various guerrilla groups operating in the region. It also served as a training and command facility. The Mujahideen had dug tunnels up to 500 m into the Sodyaki Ghar mountain, with accommodations including a hotel, a mosque, a medical point and a garage to house the two T-55 tanks that had been captured from the DRA in 1983. The troops defending the base numbered 500, and they were armed with a D-30 howitzer, several BM-21 multiple rocket launchers and five ZPU-1 and ZPU-2 heavy machine-guns for air defence. Additionally, other Mujahideen groups were active in the area, and they participated in the defense of the base when necessary. These groups were part of various movements including the Hezbi Islami, the Hezb-e Islami Khalis, the Harakat-i-Inqilab-i-Islami and the Mahaz-e-Melli, though all in theory came under the authority of regional commander Jalaluddin Haqqani. The first battle The first offensive was launched in September 1985 by elements of the 12th and 25th DRA divisions, supported by Soviet airpower, at a time when the major Mujahideen commanders were absent, including Haqqani, who was performing the Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca. The DRA forces first attacked from Khost, and succeeded in capturing the village of Bori, to the northeast of Zhawar. They then ran into heavy resistance and had to pull back. The main attack came on September 4, and was at first successful, capturing the village of Lezhi and killing a Mujahideen commander. Very soon the attack was halted at the Manay Kandow pass, that had been heavily fortified by the Mujahideen. For 10 days the defenders held out, but were finally forced to withdraw, under heavy airstrikes by Soviet aircraft. This enabled the DRA forces to cross the pass and capture the Tor Kamar position, overlooking Zhawar, from where they could direct artillery fire at the Mujahideen base. At this point the Mujahideen launched a counter- attack, led by their two T-55 tanks. The DRA were caught by surprise, as they had not expected to meet armour, and they fell back after sustaining heavy losses. The DRA commander tried to renew the assault, but by that time the Mujahideen had received reinforcements from Pakistan, and they were able to repel further attacks. Finally after 42 of days fighting, the DRA units withdrew to their bases. This victory considerably boosted the morale of the Mujahideen. The second battle The second offensive was conducted on a larger scale, and eventually involved 12,000 troops, including 2,200 Soviets, led by DRA General Nabi Azimi, with Soviet General V. G. Trofimenko serving as advisor. The offensive began on 28 February 1986, a short while after General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev had announced the decision to withdraw Soviet troops from Afghanistan. Thus the Soviet units were initially confined to supporting the Afghan offensive. The opening moves were conducted by DRA ground troops attacking from Khost and Gardez who made very slow progress, due to bad weather and harassment by the Mujahideen, reaching the approaches to Zhawar only one month later. The second phase of the offensive was to be an airborne assault carried out by the Afghan 38th Commando Brigade. The initial assault group, transported by Mi-8 helicopters, departed on 2 April, but they got lost in the darkness and accidentally landed on the wrong side of the Pakistani border. This force was quickly surrounded and taken prisoner. The main airborne assault came in the immediate vicinity of Zhawar, and was supported by precision airstrikes by Soviet Su-25 attack aircraft. These attacks caused some losses among the Mujahideen defenders, even trapping 150 of them, including Haqqani, inside a cave that had been targeted by a missile. Haqqani later escaped and led 700-800 Mujahideen in a series of counter- attacks against the DRA landing zones, that they overran one by one. After three days of fighting, the DRA 38th Brigade had ceased to exist as a fighting force, and 530 commandos had been captured by the Mujahideen. The DRA also lost 24 helicopters. This fiasco prompted the Soviets to take over the operation, whose command was given to General Valentin Varennikov. The DRA force was strengthened with Soviet units, and the aerial bombardment of Mujahideen positions was intensified and pursued round the clock. Eventually, on April 17, the offensive was renewed. After several unsuccessful attempts, the DRA/Soviet force managed to capture the strategic Dawri Gar mountain. At a crucial moment, a Hezbi Islami unit drew back from their positions without fighting. At the same time, Jalaluddin Haqqani was injured in an airstrike, causing rumours of his death to spread rapidly among the Mujahideen, and their forces abandoned the defense of Zhawar, that was overrun by government forces. The Soviet engineers tasked with destroying the base had very little time to do so, as the Afghan troops were intent on withdrawing as soon as possible, fearing a Mujahideen counter-attack. In the end they tried to do as much damage as they could by detonating explosives inside the caves, and laying seismic mines before withdrawing hurriedly. Aftermath and losses The Soviet and DRA losses remain uncertain, but were presumably heavy. The Mujahideen claimed to have destroyed 24 helicopters and 2 jets, and captured 530 prisoners, for a loss of 281 killed and 363 injured. Of the 500 Afghan prisoners, 78 officers were tried and executed by Haqqani and Khalis, including the commander of the 38th commando brigade, Colonel Qalandar Shah. The Afghan government celebrated their victory, and though the success had proved costly, it served to alleviate the pressure on Khost, that was then under siege. However, Zhawar was quickly retaken by the Mujahideen, who repaired the damage, and strengthened their defenses.

Born and educated in Tennessee, he was a member of the Fugitives. He taught neurology at the Harvard Medical School and published research about alcoholism. He was the author of many collections of poetry. Early life Moore was born in 1903 in Columbia, Tennessee. His father, John Trotwood Moore, was a novelist and local historian who served as the State Librarian and Archivist from 1919 to 1929. His paternal grandfather was a lawyer from Marion, Alabama, who served in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. Moore was educated at Montgomery Bell Academy in Nashville, Tennessee, graduating in 1920. He attended Vanderbilt University, where he became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. He also joined the Fugitives, a group of then unknown poets who met to read and criticize each other's poems. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1924. He took an M.D. from the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in 1928. He interned at the Saint Thomas Hospital in Nashville for a year. Career as a psychiatrist Moore was a psychiatrist in the Ericksonian tradition. He taught neurology at the Harvard Medical School and the Boston City Hospital. He also conducted research on alcohol and addiction. In a 1937 article published in the New England Journal of Medicine, he argued that alcoholism had become rampant in the United States, and he called for the establishment of special wards for alcoholics in hospitals. Two years later, in the same journal, he argued that the heavier an individual, the less likely they were to feel drunk. By 1943, in the Boston number of the Medical Clinics of North America, he argued that adult neurosis and alcoholism could be prevented if parents ensured children matched the skills of their peers and never \\"go off the track of normal development\\". He also published articles in medical journals about \\"drug addiction, suicide, venereal disease [...], the psychoneurosis of war, migraine headaches.\\" Meanwhile, Moore also treated patients like Robert Frost's daughter, who suffered from paranoia and depression. During World War II, Moore served as a psychiatrist in the United States Army's Bougainville Campaign as well as in New Zealand. On September 22, 1942, Moore gave a speech about Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf entitled What Hitler means in \\"Mein Kampf\\" at the Fitzsimons Army Medical Center in Aurora, Colorado; a year later, it was reprinted in Military Surgeon. Moore served as Lieutenant-Colonel in Nanking, where he was \\"director of medical operations\\". He was the recipient of the Bronze Star Medal for his war service. After the war, Moore played a key behind-the-scenes role in the Ezra Pound controversy, as a member of a group of literary men who saw to it that the modernist icon escaped a treason trial for his radio propaganda in support of Mussolini. Moore was a close friend of one of the psychiatrists on a diagnostic panel that found Pound unfit to stand trial. Poetry Throughout his career Moore produced sonnets in a very high volume. Estimates vary but by 1935, Louis Untermeyer had counted 25,000 sonnets in Moore's files, according to a Time Magazine article that year; just over two years later, a 1938 Talk of the Town piece in the New Yorker put Moore's total production of sonnets at 50,000. Moore discovered his affinity for the sonnet form while still in secondary school and is said to have learned shorthand during college in order to be able to write more sonnets between classes. Although some of his work, such as the posthumous quatrain collection The Phoenix and the Bees, is in other forms, the poet-psychiatrist wrote and archived his poems in a dedicated home office he called his \\"sonnetorium.\\" Some of his books, like Case Record from a Sonnetorium or More Clinical Sonnets, were illustrated by Edward Gorey. It was Moore who put the young Robert Lowell in contact with literary men including Ford Madox Ford, Allen Tate and John Crowe Ransom, and who encouraged Lowell to become a student of Ransom after Lowell's sudden violent break with his family and departure from Harvard. Personal life and death Moore married to Ann Leslie Nichol in 1930. Together they had four children: Adam, John, Leslie, and Hester. He published articles about conchology. Moore died of cancer on September 21, 1957 in Boston, Massachusetts. He was 54.

He played as a catcher in Major League Baseball from 1970 to 1983 for the Los Angeles Dodgers, St. Louis Cardinals, Houston Astros, and the California Angels. After his playing career, Ferguson became a coach and minor league manager. Career Ferguson reached the majors in 1970 with the Los Angeles Dodgers, becoming their everyday catcher in 1973. He set a major league record for catchers by committing only three errors, leading the National League catchers in fielding percentage (.996) and double plays (17), while hitting .263 with a .369 on-base percentage. He also reached career-highs in games played (136), home runs (25), RBI (88), runs (84), doubles (26) and walks (87). When Steve Yeager became a regular in the 1973 midseason, Ferguson shared catching duties and played right field against left-handed pitchers. He soon became known for having one of the strongest throwing arms of any outfielder in the major leagues. This came into play during Game One of the 1974 World Series against the Oakland Athletics, when Ferguson made a memorable play in right field in the top of the eighth inning, running in front of teammate Jimmy Wynn to catch a fly ball off the bat of Reggie Jackson, and then firing a 300-foot strike to Yeager to gun down Sal Bando, who was trying to score from third base. In Game Two, Ferguson hit a two-run homer off Vida Blue to provide the only Dodgers' victory in the Series. He enjoyed another fine season in 1977 with Houston, catching 122 games and hitting 16 home runs with 61 RBI and a .379 OBP. Reacquired by the Dodgers in the 1978 midseason, he helped his team reach the 1978 World Series. After retiring, he coached at the major league level with the Texas Rangers (1986‚Äì87), working under former Dodger teammate Bobby Valentine, and the Dodgers (1988‚Äì94). He also managed in the Dodgers, Baltimore Orioles and San Diego Padres minor league systems. He managed the Camden Riversharks Atlantic League baseball team in New Jersey for 3 seasons from 2007 - 2009. In a 14-season career, Ferguson was a .240 hitter with 122 home runs and 445 RBI in 1013 games. In 13 postseason games, he hit .200 (7-for-35) with one home run and four RBI.

A majority of abolitionists disagreed, but about 36% of abolitionists supported Hayes, thereby causing a decided division in their ranks. * Polakoff, Keith Ian.

It ended the promise of Reconstruction, as many scholars have argued, and more importantly it maintained the still fragile Union. Historians mostly ignored Grant's decisive role in engineering the compromise. He was not a lame duck but took a deep interest in the behind-the-scenes negotiations. His apparent inaction stemmed from the very real threat of violence that could once again divide the nation, and ultimately his quiet diplomacy was key to the final peaceful outcome.

It is formed by a first-magnitude spring (Rainbow Springs) that is ranked fourth in the state for volume of discharge. In addition to the springs located at the headwaters, there are many smaller springs that discharge from numerous caves, rock crevices, and sand boils the entire length of the river. The Rainbow River is a gently winding river that is long and merges with the Withlacoochee River at Dunnellon, Florida. The headwaters, Rainbow Springs, is the anchor for Rainbow Springs State Park. This first- magnitude spring is not one large vent but is numerous vents that issue 400 - 600 million gallons of crystalline water every day. Rainbow Springs State Park is a popular destination to swim, snorkel, canoe, picnic, or stroll on the walking paths to enjoy the many plants and animals that abound here. Once named Wekiwa Creek, Blue Spring, and Blue Run, archaeological evidence indicates that the waters of the Rainbow River have attracted and sustained human inhabitants for over 10,000 years. The crystal clear water, abundant with fish, wildlife and vegetation along with the constant water temperature of 72Rainbow Springs State Park degrees Fahrenheit (22 ¬∞C), has attracted a number of modern-day activities. Rainbow Springs and the Rainbow River became popular in the late 1880s when hard rock phosphate was discovered in the area. A small community called Juliette flourished near the springs during this \\"boomtown\\" era. In the 1930s the spring was developed as a tourist attraction. Sea walls, a lodge, gift shop, the waterfalls, and a reptile exhibit were developed. Under new ownership, the real heyday for the attraction occurred in the 1960s. During that time activity greatly increased with glass-bottomed boat rides, riverboat rides, log raft rides, a gift shop and cafe, an aviary, a leaf-shaped gondola/monorail system, a horse rodeo, and submarine boat tours. Not faring well when traffic began using I-75 instead of U.S. Highway 41, with many tourists heading to a new attraction called Walt Disney World, the attraction closed in 1974. The Rainbow River was designated as a Registered Natural Landmark in 1972, an Aquatic Preserve in 1986, and an \\"Outstanding Florida Waterway\\" in 1987. The state purchased the original area that was the Rainbow Springs attraction in 1990. Volunteers cleared the overgrown park and opened the park on weekends to the public. The Florida Park Service officially opened Rainbow Springs State Park on a full-time basis on March 9, 1995. Rainbow Springs State Park comprises of upland (which includes around of wetlands) and that are submerged. The most significant natural feature is the first-magnitude headspring basin which produces between 400 - 600 million gallons of fresh water per day, forming the Rainbow River. The looking-glass waters of Rainbow Springs come from several vents, not one large bubbling spring. The river itself supports a wide variety of fish, wildlife, and plants, many within easy viewing by visitors. In total, the park contains 11 distinct natural communities, including sandhills, flatwoods, upland mixed forests, and hydric hammocks. Visitors are able to see a variety of wildflowers in season; oak, longleaf pines, magnolia, dogwood, redbud, and hickory trees; gray squirrels, red-shoulder hawks, swallowtail kites, barred owls, whitetail deer, and a wide variety of wading birds. The relative peace and quiet of the winter season offers much for the nature enthusiast. There is an interpretive room located in the visitor center displaying historical, natural, and cultural resources of the park.

The floor space covered is 1.1 million square feet (102,000 square meters). http://www.boeing.com/company/about-bca/renton-production-facility.page The factory lies adjacent to Renton Municipal Airport. History The Boeing Renton Factory is built on land reclaimed by the lowering of the level of Lake Washington in 1916. From 1916 until 1936 it belonged to the family of Pioneer Washington Coal Industrialist Charles H. Burnett for whom Burnett Avenue and Burnett Park in Renton are named. Burnett acquired the land intending to use it for coal storage and shipment. Amy Louise Burnett Bond, Charles Burnett's daughter, whose mother died young, was raised by Mr. and Mrs. Howard Cranston Potter as the foster sister and godmother of Bertha Potter (Mrs William Boeing). The Burnett family operated the land as a hay farm. In 1936 Amy Burnett Bond transferred the property back to the state government. It was still mostly semi swamp economically marginal and would cost millions to improve. The property was then transferred by the State of Washington to the federal government at the start of World War II. The Navy Department established an aircraft factory there for production of the Boeing PBB Sea Ranger flying boat. This order was cancelled, however, to free the factory for production of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, the factory being transferred to the Army in exchange for use of the North American Aviation Kansas City factory for production of land based North American B-25 Mitchells for the US Marine Corps as PBJ-1s.Bowers 1989, pp.248‚Äì249. Aircraft production=Boeing B-29= 1,119 B-29s were built in the Renton plant.B-29 Superfortress Retrieved 10 August 2011. =Boeing C-97= At the end of World War II, the plant was closed but by 1948 it was re-opened by Boeing to build the Boeing C-97 Stratofreighter for the United States Air Force. In all, 943 C-97s were built in the Renton plant. =Boeing 707/KC-135= In May 1954 the prototype of what would become the Boeing 707, the Boeing 367-80, was rolled out at the Renton plant starting a long association with the production of the Boeing 707 line. When the first production Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker first flew in August 1956 from Renton it was named City of Renton. The first production Boeing 707 was rolled out at Renton on 28 October 1957 and production continued to the last 707. =Boeing 727= The Boeing 707 final assembly building was also used to produce the Boeing 727 three-engined airliner from 1963 To 1984. =Boeing 737= Assembly of a 737 in the Renton Factory In order to produce the twin-engined Boeing 737 a new assembly line was built in 1966 at Renton and the plant is still building the Boeing 737 family. The 737 final assembly building when built was at the time the largest building in the world by volume. New aircraft perform their first flight from the adjacent Renton Municipal Airport and are then flown to Boeing Field for customer preparation. In 2011 after a lengthy negotiation, Boeing and the Machinist Union have agreed to produce the 737 MAX, an improved redesign, at the existing facility in Renton. Boeing opened a completion center in Zhoushan, China, to install interiors for planes built in Renton and delivered to Chinese airlines. The Renton factory also produces the P-8 Poseidon, a maritime patrol aircraft for the United States Navy. =Boeing 747= The first four 747s built were refurbished in the Boeing Renton Factory.Boeing Commercial Airplanes 737 Manufacturing Site Retrieved 10 August 2011. =Boeing 757= The plant also built all 1,049 Boeing 757s.

Biography Corlett was born in Darlington, County Durham. He was educated at Fettes College, Edinburgh, then trained as an actor at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. He worked as an actor while embarking on a literary career during the 1960s, and wrote plays and adult novels as well as the children's novels for which he is particularly remembered. Several of his works were adapted for the screen. Later in life he came out as gay, and it was from his partner, Bryn Ellis, that he gained some of his inspiration for The Magician's House. Corlett died at Sarlat in France. Corlett's first novel, The Gate of Eden (1974), appeared before publishers began using labels such as \\"Young Adult\\" to categorise novels that seem suitable for middle to late adolescence. The Gate of Eden is an apparently simple story about a mid- teenage schoolboy who makes friends with an eccentric retired bachelor school teacher. This is the boy's first step beyond the confines of home and school. By the end of the book the boy has found his first girlfriend and rejects the old man's fussy, demanding friendship in favour of the young woman. The character of the vulnerable old man, Tom Falcolner, is presented as vividly as that of the boy who is the unnamed first person narrator. He tells the story, recalling, quoting from letters and commenting on his own memories and failings, long after the events revealing himself in breathtakingly painful detail. Tom is also a fascinating character: grubby, used to his loneliness, yet keen to share his love of literature with the boy who wants to be a writer. The balance of interest between youth and old age is equal part of the reason for it not being a Young Adult book and the point of view is strictly adult, tinged with bitter sweet nostalgia and regret, poetically told, ending with a poem. The book is also an account of first love and (implicitly) first sex. But this is tarnished with rumours of scandal (probably homosexual) associated with the old man having been fired from a school. However, despite such sexual matters, treated in a very low-key way, the overall feeling matches that of the A. E. Housman poems which are quoted when Tom introduces them to the boy. What is the significance of the title? Unreligious old Tom defends his unkempt garden, saying, \\"Nature must take care of itself ‚Ä¶. Besides the weeds are as beautiful as the flowers! Were there weeds in Eden?\\" (p 15). Near the end, the young man remembers walking very slowly to a fateful appointment, but doubts his memory: \\"As like as not I bounded towards the gate of Eden and the land beyond\\" (p 158). The second volume, The Land Beyond (1975), takes the unnamed young man through the aftermath of a three-year relationship with a different girl. Although the end of a non-marital affair can be of interest to teenagers, all the characters are adult. The narrative progresses through several different styles and levels: stream of consciousness, notebook, diary, TV screen play, meditation, dream, memory, a time-slip narrative as the man explores the temples at Delphi, and metaphysical speculation about life and the last page contains a poem. The reader must work with this rich mass of narrative and emotional material. Certainly Corlett makes demands on the reader. But young adults will be stimulated by the challenge. Reflecting on his affair with the young woman called Gilly, the man wonders about the nature of his \\"love\\" and the way people relate. \\"How little we understand one another. Maybe that's what it is all about - just understanding\\" (p 151). He realises a paradox of loving: \\"I love you and I must let you go\\" (p 152). Near the end he recognises the limitations, even the trap-like nature of his \\"love\\": \\"I can't struggle any more, Gilly. I give up. I can only live\\" (p 168). Pondering existence, he muses: \\"Life, trapped in matter, yearning for release\\" (p 113); \\"There is nowhere that I wish to be ‚Ä¶ I just want time to pass ‚Ä¶ The whole of existence seems pointless\\" (p 128). It is a crisis similar to that in Jean-Paul Sartre's Nausea, hinting at the overall theme of the whole trilogy: For Man's cry to be heard he must create a God; only then can compassion arise; only then can Man's suffering be understood, can Man's cry be answered ... \\"HELP ME.\\" Thus Adam cried at the gate of Eden ... The first words that [the children of Adam] utter on the great journey back to Eden and the return to the gate. (p 114) The main story of the rebirth of the young man after the death of the affair links with a confrontation or mutual haunting between the young man and the young Greek who was the model for the famous statue of the Charioteer of Delphi. The central character experiences the death of the charioteer, and then is \\"reborn\\" after terrible struggles on Apollo's holy mountain. This use of time fantasy and living mythology links the book with the recently popular (children's) genre of a modern story being haunted by the presence of ancient mythology. However the experimental nature of the writing or narrating demands far more than is usual with children's books. Appropriately, the third volume of the trilogy is called Return to the Gate (1975). It presents the unnamed narrator as an old man, surviving alone in an era (after North Sea Oil?) of political collapse and economic scarcity. The old man, a relic of the lost old world, meets a young woman who is a drop-out from the new alternatives. They establish a tentative relationship and help each other try to cope with the violence of the authoritarian society they live in. This subtly reworks the structure of relationships in The Gate of Eden. However the three books, taken together do not obviously constitute a trilogy. The cover blurb describes them as an \\"emotional trilogy\\", which is partly true. But there are large gaps in time between the school student, the traveller to Delphi, and the old man in the future. Corlett does not attempt to fill these gaps. Instead he sketches a sense of continuity of character, this man who became a writer, who once read A. E. Housman, who once visited Greece, and lived with a woman called Gilly. A man who fell apart emotionally at the end of the affair, and has been alone ever since. It is better described as a triptych. Another of Corlett's novels, Bloxworth Blue (1984), named after a species of rare butterfly, explores many of Corlett's usual themes through five related strands of story. There is a medieval legend of two Imps and Lincoln Cathedral; memories of the very elderly uncle; marital crisis of the mother; first sexual encounter of the seventeen-year-old daughter; and adventures of the thirteen-year-old son as he explores the cathedral, relives the Imp legend, recalls an trauma from his early childhood, and discovers his uncle's bitter secret under tragic circumstances. All of this is strongly held together by the narrative drive, the intense sense of location and time hot summer in a crowded medieval town and the imagery of a brilliant rare blue butterfly. Guilt, death, love, betrayal, murder, pain, lust, youth, old age, time and god: Bloxworth Blue is a strong mixture. The Secret Line (1988), tackles quite different issues. Illegitimacy, an unknown father and a new step-father, adolescence, strained relations between mother and daughter, problems at school, murdering hooligans all of these bubble at the surface, while beneath there is the problem of race and madness! Fifteen-year-old Jo Carson is mixed-race: American Negro father and English mother. He was a soldier. They fell in love, Jo was conceived and he was killed in Vietnam before they could marry. Jo's mother, Anne, has never been able to talk to Jo about this. Knowing nothing about her natural father, Jo is resentful and antagonistic towards her step-father, a film-maker. Ironically an image from a film, Casablanca, begins the book, as Jo starts to grow into adulthood, confronting her racial anxiety, and her sexual anxiety. This theme twists further in the linking of other characters. Jo dreams about the room where her mother and father made love. She finds that this dream has been made into a painting by a dead artist, a painting of a room where the artist and his wife also made love. What is the borderline between fiction and truth? madness and sanity? does the sea crash invisibly on the other side of the glaring shutters in the dream and the painting? Paintings are dreams, and are also openings that lead to other worlds. At times it seems that Corlett is writing a book that moves from our real world to some strangely surrealistic other world. Jo has a friend called Mit, the only other coffee-coloured person she has ever met. Strangely, she only meets Mit when she is on her own. He shows her a secret underground train-line, which gives the title of the book, and together they explore the strange worlds that exist outside the stations of this line, including Lakeside, Beyond, Waterway and Jungle. Jo also meets an old lady, the wife of the dead painter, and a young man who wants to become a painter. And there is the vicious racist teenage thug, Straker, who threatens them all, and precipitates the final crisis. With the sequence of four novels, collectively called \\"The Magician's House\\" (1990 - 1992), Corlett deliberately sought a younger audience (from 8 to 80, instead of from 15 to 75). The fantasy link between contemporary characters in a modern world and events from the past irrupting into the present, which had existed in The Land Beyond and Bloxworth Blue, becomes explicit in \\"The Magician's House\\". At first glance this, and other matters in the tetralogy, resemble Susan Cooper's sequence \\"The Dark is Rising\\". Without giving too much of the story away, Cooper's Gandalf-like figure, Merriman Lyon, has his counterpart in Corlett's Stephen Tyler, the Magician of the title, who lived around 1550 in the time of Elizabeth the First, and studied alchemy in Golden House, a very old house in the remote English countryside, near the Forest of Dean. (This setting also resembles Holdstock and Edward's account of the journals of a magus, claimed to have been found in Ruckhurst Manor in 1977, although Corlett avoids using any hint of Black Magic with his mage.) The modern narrative of The Magician's House centres on three children: thirteen year old William Constant and his sisters, eleven-year-old Mary, and eight-year-old Alice. While both Constant parents are working as doctors in a famine relief camp in Ethiopia, the children go from their boarding schools to stay at Golden House through the Christmas holidays with their maternal uncle Jack Green and his pregnant de facto wife Phoebe Taylor. This appears to be a typical hackneyed genre setting, but Corlett plays with it in his own way. The three Constant children are not Blytonesque clones (nor imitations of Cooper's Drew children, or Lewis's Pevensie children). They squabble, are confronted by Phoebe's vegetarianism (Alice calls Jack and Phoebe \\"vegetables\\"), shocked by Phoebe's unwedded pregnancy, and affronted by the seeming \\"rudeness\\" of birth, breast feeding, bottoms, pooping and farting. These may be minor aspects of the children's character, but they give a gritty sense of modern childhood which is often lacking in similar fantasy novels. Rapidly the children find that the old house and the whole of the Golden Valley is threatened. Stephen Tyler's magic enables him to travel forward from his own time to the time of the children, seeking their help against his evil assistant Matthew Morden. Revealing more would spoil the overall story, or each of the four stories, for while Corlett works out the large conflict through the sequence, each book contains its own key stage in the larger scheme, and each can be read separately. Stephen Tyler explains to the children that alchemy is partly concerned with the quest to turn base metal into gold, and even to be able to travel through time. But far more importantly, he says, it tries to focus on finding the \\"gold\\" within the person, a quest in which physical gold, lead and mercury are merely symbols: \\"to take the first step on the journey to [a person] becoming gold ... stop the [Mercury] mind from buzzing here and there, pursuing every little thought that enters the head, every little idea, every little craving or sensation. Stop the mind ... and hold it still ... the next stage is, little by little, to warm the Mercury; warm the Mind ‚Ä¶ with the heat of the heart\\" (The Door in the Tree p 179). \\"For, at the heart of us all ‚Ä¶ there is a grain of pure Gold. That Gold is the Self. That Gold is called Love. It is everyman's birth-right\\" (pp 104 ‚Äì 105). Corlett also uses in his own way the shared experience of an animal's point of view, such as Merlin provides for young Wart, in T.H. White's The Sword in the Stone (1938). In Corlett's hands this becomes archetypal encounters between child and animal: Cinnabar the fox, Sirius the dog, Jasper the Owl, Merula the blackbird, Lutra the otter, Falco the kestrel, Bawson the badger, Corvus the crow, Pica the magpie, Rus the red squirrel, Mustel the weasel and Cervus the deer. In The Bridge in the Clouds Corlett also introduces Rattus Rattus, a noble, brave, swaggering and most appealing rat, a worthy companion to Graham's Ratty, Masefield's Rat the cellarman (in The Midnight Folk), Lewis's Reepicheep, and Hoban's Manny Rat. Indeed, there are hints of Wind in the Willows in the badgers of The Door in the Tree and the rats, weasels, stoats and ferrets in the final conflict of The Bridge in the Clouds. Exploiting the fantasy genre of good-versus-evil conflict genre, while avoiding the dangers of poorly used fantasy, especially time travel with its logical imperatives and potential paradoxes, The Magician's House works well. Corlett makes the small local victory around Golden Valley, and the impact of Stephen Tyler's death in his own time, resonate powerfully beyond the immediate locale without trying to claim that the entire universe has been saved by one brief bloody battle. Indeed, his focus on humans, and issues of being human, (which include Ethiopia, Chernobyl, ozone layers, global warming, and like matters), gives the sequence an appealing and sobering humility that similar fantasies frequently fail to achieve because of the super-human nature of their characters and their huge deeds. Also Corlett's animal characters behave like real animals, red in tooth and claw sometimes shockingly, as when Pica the friendly magpie eats a shrew who is also on the magician's side (The Bridge in the Clouds pp. 216 ‚Äì 217). While the humans are central to the narrative, Corlett makes it absolutely clear that there is no natural superiority of humans over other species, and indeed the humans are responsible for the dire situations all the species find themselves in. Few, if any other, fantasy sequences take this most commendable point of view. Imagine if the heroes in Alan Garner's 'Weirdstone' sequence had to cope with palug cats being an endangered species!

During the 2001 Trampoline World Championships, held in July, in the city of Odense, the gold medal was awarded Karavayeva incorrectly following a serious judging mistake. Karavayeva, at the World Games in August 2001, made the following statement; \\"I very much regret the mistake of the judges at the World Championships in Denmark. I consider that it is necessary to correct this mistake and I decided to give the Gold Medal to my friend Ana Dogonadze from Germany in the spirit of friendship and fair-play.\\" FIG (F√©d√©ration Internationale de Gymnastique) rules state that once a medal has been awarded, official results cannot be changed. However, FIG President and IOC Member, Mr Bruno Grandi, made an exception to this ruling and allowed the error to be corrected. This led to Karavayeva being awarded the silver medal. Following this incident, she received the International Fair Play award from the hand of IOC President, Jacques Rogge. Karavayeva took the World Record for the most difficult trampolining routine completed in a competition by a woman. The difficulty was 15.60. This record was broken on October 8, 2011, by Emma Smith (GBR), at the Trampoline and Tumbling World Cup, held in Odense, Denmark.

He was selected by the Milwaukee Brewers in the second round of the 2004 Major League Baseball draft out of Trimble Technical High School in Fort Worth, Texas. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Milwaukee Brewers, Baltimore Orioles, Texas Rangers, Seattle Mariners, and Cincinnati Reds. Gallardo was an All-Star in 2010, and won the Silver Slugger Award for pitchers that year. Career Gallardo attended Green B. Trimble Technical High School in Fort Worth, Texas. He committed to attend Texas Christian University (TCU) on a college baseball scholarship to play for the TCU Horned Frogs. The Milwaukee Brewers selected Gallardo in the second round of the 2004 Major League Baseball draft. Gallardo signed with the Brewers, rather than enroll at TCU. =Milwaukee Brewers=2006 season With Brevard County Manatees of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League, Gallardo had a no-hitter for innings before surrendering a triple on June 9; Gallardo finished the game with 11 strikeouts. Splitting time between Brevard County and the Huntsville Stars of the Class AA Southern League, he led all minor league pitchers with 188 strikeouts in 155 innings of work, the most in a single season by a Milwaukee Brewers prospect. His Double-A line included 13 starts and a 1.63 earned run average (ERA). 2007 season Gallardo started the season with the Nashville Sounds of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League. On June 14, the Milwaukee Brewers announced the call-up of Gallardo to replace starter Chris Capuano, who was placed on the disabled list with a strained left groin. Gallardo made his major league debut against the San Francisco Giants on June 18, yielding 3 earned runs in innings for the win, with three walks and four strikeouts. In Gallardo's first at-bat in the majors, he hit an RBI double. For his second career start on June 24, Gallardo had a no-hitter into the 5th inning. He would later take the no-decision when the bullpen blew the lead in the 8th. After coming out of the bullpen for three games, Gallardo was inserted back into the starting rotation on July 17 when then-Brewers ace Ben Sheets went on the 15-day disabled list with a right distal finger sprain. 2008 season Gallardo started the season on the disabled list. He went on the 15-day DL on March 21, , with a torn lateral meniscus in his left knee. Upon his return on April 20, Gallardo pitched well during the next three games, compiling a 1.80 ERA in twenty innings of work. During his start on May 1, Gallardo jumped to get out of the way of a diving Chicago Cubs player ‚Äì Reed Johnson ‚Äì and landed awkwardly, bending his right knee extensively, during the 5th inning. He continued to pitch through the 6th, but was later diagnosed with a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Gallardo was placed on the 15-day disabled list, and was not activated until September 24. Gallardo was the starting pitcher in game 1 of the NLDS on October 1, 2008 against the Philadelphia Phillies. He ended up taking the loss to Cole Hamels. 2009 season Milwaukee Brewers in 2009 During Spring training for 2009, Gallardo was offered to pitch for Mexico in the World Baseball Classic, but turned it down to focus on getting ready for the 2009 season. A few baseball commentators, notably Eric Karabell of ESPN, believed that Gallardo would be the Brewers' ace for the coming season. His first start was on April 8 against the Giants, lasting innings, giving up only 2 runs and striking-out 6 en route to getting the win. He made news in the 6th inning when he hit a three-run home run off of Randy Johnson, becoming the first pitcher to ever hit a home run off of Johnson. Gallardo pitched his first career complete game on April 24 against the Houston Astros. Gallardo allowed only two runs on five hits, striking out seven. His family was in attendance for the game, and were moved to behind the Brewers dugout for the final inning. Gallardo made baseball news again in his next start against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Gallardo pitched 8 shutout innings and hit a home run in the 7th, which was the only run of the game. Gallardo became only the 26th pitcher in major league history to win a game 1‚Äì0 while hitting a home run, and joined Red Ruffing and Early Wynn as the only ones to do so while striking out 10 or more batters (Gallardo struck out 11, also a career high). Gallardo tossed a 2-hitter on Memorial Day against the St. Louis Cardinals. He struck out 6 batters, one of them Albert Pujols. He struck out 9 on May 31 against the Cincinnati Reds. Gallardo pitched another 2-hitter on June 5, shutting out the Atlanta Braves 4‚Äì0. He struck out six Braves in the victory. Gallardo struggled with his stamina in the final two months of the season, and was finally benched for the remainder of the year in mid-September. Gallardo started 30 games for the Brewers, with a record of 13‚Äì12 with a 3.73 ERA. He struck out 204 batters over 185 innings pitched, becoming only the 4th Brewer pitcher to strike out 200+ batters. 2010 season On April 7, the Brewers signed Gallardo to a five-year, $30.1 million contract extension through the 2014 season, with an $13 million option for 2015. Gallardo pitched his first career complete game shutout on May 28 at Miller Park against the New York Mets, outdueling Mets ace Johan Santana 2‚Äì0. Gallardo was selected to his first all-star game in the 2010 season, but just after he was elected, he got injured. On August 27, 2010, Gallardo was robbed at gunpoint at a Milwaukee supermarket. He and clubhouse attendant Alex Sanchez handed over jewelry and money to the robbers. Sanchez was struck on the head with the butt of the gun. Gallardo had a solid 2010 season, going 14‚Äì7 with a 3.84 ERA and 200 strikeouts in 185 innings pitched, plus two complete game shutouts. Gallardo also was stellar at the plate, batting .254 with 4 home runs, 10 RBIs, and a .504 slugging percentage. Gallardo was awarded the National League Silver Slugger award as the best hitting pitcher. 2011 season Gallardo was named the opening day starter for the second straight year after a rib injury placed Zack Greinke on the DL. On April 5, his second start of the season, Gallardo recorded his third complete game shutout in his career. The opposing Atlanta Braves were only able to record two hits and two walks. Gallardo also recorded a hit and scored the only run of the game. On April 23, he hit his ninth home run of his career off of the Astros' Nelson Figueroa as the Brewers won 14‚Äì7. On May 7, Gallardo pitched a no-hitter into the 8th inning against the St. Louis Cardinals, but it was ended by a lead-off single by Daniel Descalso in the 8th that just slipped past a diving Craig Counsell. It turned out to be the only hit of the game for St. Louis as Gallardo finished the 8th inning by retiring the next 3 batters and Brewers closer John Axford closed out the 9th inning in a 4‚Äì0 Brewers win. Gallardo walked 4 batters and struck out 6 in the game. On his August 21 start against the New York Mets, Gallardo earned his 14th win of the season, matching his career high. The win was also his 50th career win in the majors. On September 17, Gallardo set a new career high in strikeouts with 13 against the Cincinnati Reds, including 4 in one inning, with Brandon Phillips reaching on a wild 3rd strike. Gallardo became the second Brewer ever to strike out 4 batters in one inning, with Manny Parra being the other. Gallardo also won his 17th game of the season, the most by a Brewer since Chris Capuano won 18 games in 2005. On September 23, in his final regular season start, Gallardo struck out 11 Marlins. It was the third straight start in which Gallardo struck out at least 11 batters, and it ensured him another 200 strikeout season, his third in a row. As a result of this game, he became the first Brewers pitcher to notch 3 straight double digit strikeout starts, as well as 3 straight 200+ strikeout seasons. The only other pitchers to have three 200-K seasons at 25 or younger over the last 20 years is Kerry Wood and F√©lix Hern√°ndez. Wood did it in 1998, 2001 and 2002. Gallardo did it in 2009, 2010, and 2011. Gallardo finished with a 17‚Äì10 record for the season with a 3.52 ERA, and 207 strikeouts (fifth in the league) in 207.1 innings pitched. His 17 wins were fourth in the NL. In Game 1 of the NLDS against the Arizona Diamondbacks, Gallardo pitched 8 innings, only surrendering 4 hits and a walk, and one earned run on a solo home run by Ryan Roberts. His nine strikeouts tied a franchise record for most strikeouts in a postseason game for the Brewers. Gallardo earned a win as the Brewers went on to win 4‚Äì1. Gallardo started game 5 of the NLDS, lasting 6 innings. Control was a problem for him throughout the game, bouncing multiple pitches in front of home. He threw 66 strikes in a 112-pitch, 6-inning effort. Gallardo didn't receive the decision, surrendering 1 earned run as the Brewers went on to win 3‚Äì2 in 10 innings. Gallardo finished in 7th place in Cy Young voting, the first time Gallardo had ever received votes for the award. 2012 season On July 15, Gallardo achieved a new career high, striking out 14 Pittsburgh Pirates, the most strikeouts in a game for a Brewer since Ben Sheets struck out 18 Atlanta Braves in 2004. Gallardo had another solid season in 2012, going 16‚Äì9 with a 3.66 ERA, and 204 strikeouts in 204 innings pitched. Gallardo also led the National League with 33 games started. 2013 season Gallardo pitched for Mexico in the World Baseball Classic, where he pitched in one game, against USA. Gallardo pitched 3 1/3 innings, giving up one run and striking out 4. Gallardo struggled through the beginning of the 2013 season, losing 4 games in a row at one point, and was on the disabled list in early August before rebounding to go 4‚Äì1 to close the season. Gallardo had the worst season of his career in 2013, going 12-10 with a 4.18 ERA. For the first time in a full season, Gallardo failed to reach 200 strikeouts, striking out only 144 batters in almost 181 innings pitched. 2014 season On May 27, Gallardo achieved the rare feat of getting a walk-off hit after pinch-hitting against T.J. McFarland of the Baltimore Orioles in the bottom of the 10th inning. After McFarland intentionally walked Mark Reynolds, Gallardo hit an RBI double, resulting in a 7‚Äì6 victory for the Brewers. =Texas Rangers= On January 19, 2015, Gallardo was traded to the Texas Rangers in exchange for Corey Knebel, Luis Sardi√±as and Marcos Diplan. Gallardo pitched for the Rangers in Game 1 of the 2015 ALDS against the Toronto Blue Jays, earning the win. =Baltimore Orioles= On February 25, 2016, Gallardo signed a two-year, $22 million contract with the Baltimore Orioles, with a team option for a third year.

He finished the year with a 6‚Äì8 record, 5.42 ERA, and 85 strikeouts in 118 innings. =Seattle Mariners= On January 6, 2017, Gallardo was traded to the Seattle Mariners in exchange for Seth Smith. After struggling through the first half of the season for Seattle, Gallardo was moved to the bullpen on June 22nd. He was reinstated to the starting rotation in August due to his strong performance as a reliever and the many injuries that had been crippling the Mariners' starting pitching. However, due to several poor appearances and new pitching acquisitions, he was relegated to the bullpen once more. In 2017, he was 5-10, with a 5.72 ERA.Yovani Gallardo Stats  Baseball-Reference.com He had his option declined on November 2, 2017, and became a free agent. =Return to Milwaukee= On December 21, 2017, Gallardo signed a one-year, $2 million contract with the Milwaukee Brewers.

Originally announced under the name \\"Vertigo\\", the game focuses on special motorcycles that reach up to 450 km/h racing through dangerous tracks in a dystopian year 2021. Scorcher was one of the most graphically advanced Sega Saturn games of its time, enough so that Sega shipped an unfinished version of the game to third party developers as a graphics demo for the Saturn. Reception Though the Saturn version of Scorcher was hyped in the press during its development, the completed game underwhelmed most critics upon release. Reviews typically commented that despite its prolonged development cycle, Scorchers graphics were still cutting edge, but that the gameplay design is flawed and overall mediocre. Lee Nutter of Sega Saturn Magazine, for example, called it \\"A graphically excellent racing title where the gameplay appears to have been more of an afterthought than an integral part of the game.\\", and a Next Generation critic summarized that \\"Scorcher is a good game, with many things going for it, but Scavenger's preoccupation with making it look cool rather than play great make it a sad epitaph for the once-promising company.\\" Most critics complained at the lack of a multiplayer mode, but they otherwise varied in what exactly held back Scorchers gameplay. GamePro found the controls, particularly the use of separate buttons to execute hard turns, were too difficult. Jeff Gerstmann, writing for GameSpot, stated that it was simply too generic, while James Price of Saturn Power cited a lack of variety in the tracks. Lee Nutter agreed on this point, and additionally felt the concept of an obstacle-laden, platformer-influenced racing track was fundamentally flawed. He also criticized that \\"there are only three other competitors\\". Sushi-X of Electronic Gaming Monthly felt these competitors offered no challenge, and the track obstacles suffer from poor collision detection. His three co-reviewers defended the game, saying that it seems awful at first but is enjoyable once one masters the difficult controls. They gave it scores of 7.0 and 7.5 out of 10, while Sushi-X gave it a 3.0. Next Generation contended that few gamers would be willing to work their way over this frustrating learning curve, particularly complaining at the steep increase in difficulty on the third track and the fact that players who fall down a pit are respawned right in front of the same pit.

He followed political issues such as the peace process in Central America (Contadora Group) and the situation in the Middle East. In 1986 De Alba served as Head of the Political Department for the United Nations at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and from 1991 to 1994, as Director for Social Issues at the UN section of the Ministry. During this period he participated in the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, as well as in several sessions of the Commission on Human Rights, and the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, in which he worked particularly on the situation of Human Rights in El Salvador and the protection of migrants and other vulnerable groups. From 1994 to 1998, De Alba was Deputy Permanent Representative of Mexico to the Organization of American States (OAS), where he promoted important initiatives, such as the negotiation of the Inter-American Convention on the Elimination of Violence against Women, and the Interamerican Convention against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Fire Arms, Ammunition, Explosives, and other Related Materials (CIFTA).

Furthermore, De Alba actively promoted the negotiation and adoption of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

Her unconventional relationship (without benefit of marriage until 1946) with Francis Meynell, a poet, book designer and founder of Nonesuch Press, was childless, although she was devoted to her husband's large family of nephews and nieces. Marriage in 1946 bestowed, as the wife of a \\"K\\" (he was knighted that year), the title of \\"Lady\\", although this honorific was, technically, to be trumped by the DBE awarded her in 1949. At about the end of the Second World War, the couple acquired \\"Cobbold's Mill\\" between Lavenham and Hadleigh, Suffolk, and there, for more than 20 years, they combined keeping open house to a multitude of friends with, until retirement, pursuit of their respective careers. She and her husband took up small-scale farming there. She was also active in anti-Suez activism and early post-war socialism. Later, she was to become a founder-member of the SDP, and as late as the 1997 election she encouraged her friends to vote Lib-Dem rather than Labour on the grounds that this could end the Conservative stranglehold on Suffolk South; however, it did the opposite.

It was a single-engine, twin-float biplane of mixed construction, evaluated by the Royal Canadian Air Force and used for experimental air-mail services.. Design and development The Vanessa was developed as a private venture commercial seaplane. The Canadian Vickers Chief Engineer based his design on the contemporary Stinson cabin biplane which had been introduced in the United States. The one feature that was a departure from the Stinson was the use of interplane struts which formed an \\"X\\" (when viewed from the front), thus eliminating the need for traditional wire bracing and allowing easy access to the cabin. The enclosed cabin fuselage was constructed of steel tubing as were various support structures along with the tail surfaces. The remainder of the aircraft was of wood construction and the entire aircraft was fabric covered. Ailerons and flaps, the latter being an unusual feature in aircraft of that time, were fitted to each of the equal span wings and were also interconnected by struts. Testing A prototype, G-CYZJ, was constructed, after which the Royal Canadian Air Force evinced an interest in the type as a communications aircraft. Service testing indicated that the aircraft was under-powered and the Armstrong Siddeley Lynx was replaced with a Wright Whirlwind In September 1927, the still experimental Vickers Vanessa was used for series of trial airmail runs involving the first airmail delivery. While waiting off the dock at Rimouski, Quebec, on 9 September 1927, Royal Canadian Air Force Squadron Leader John H. Tudhope received of mail from the inbound RMS Empress of France While taxiing the Vanessa for takeoff, a strut ruptured and punctured the aircraft's starboard float causing it to tip over to that side. The propeller lopped off half the float and the machine broke up, resulting in the aircraft sinking. Tudhope scrambled to safety and the mail was rescued, eventually reaching its destinations by rail. Following a subsequent salvage, the Vanessa was considered uneconomical to repair and was abandoned. Despite a very brief career, the Vanessa has the distinction of being one of the first enclosed cabin aircraft to be designed and built in Canada and the first aircraft to be used in an experimental airmail flight in Canada.

He was also a maternal great-uncle of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh through his eldest sister Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine. Life Friedrich, called \\"Frittie\\" in the family, was a cheerful and lively child despite his illness. \\"Leopold\\" was added as one of his names in honor of his mother's hemophiliac brother, Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, who was Friedrich's godfather. Death His haemophilia was first diagnosed in February 1873, a few months before his death, when he cut his ear and bled for three days. Bandages could not stanch the flow of blood.Mager (1998), p. 45 In late May 1873, Friedrich and his older brother Ernst were playing together in their mother's bedroom. Ernst ran to another room, which was set at right angles to Alice's bedroom and peered through the window at his younger brother. Alice ran to get Ernst away from the window. When she was out of the room, Friedrich climbed onto a chair next to an open window in his mother's bedroom to get a closer look at his brother. The chair tipped over and Friedrich tumbled through the window, falling twenty feet to the balustrade below. Friedrich survived the fall and might have lived had he not been a haemophiliac. He died hours later of a brain hemorrhage.Mager (1998), p. 45 Aftermath Following Friedrich's death, his distraught mother often prayed at his grave and marked anniversaries of small events in his life.

As a member of the Irish Parliamentary Party, he served in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from 1897 to 1918 as Member of Parliament (MP) for South Roscommon. He was also editor and proprietor of the Westmeath Examiner, published in Mullingar, Co. Westmeath, and a member of the Irish Board of Agriculture. He was imprisoned four times by the British administration under different Coercion Acts. He was the seventh son of Luke and Mary Hayden of County Roscommon, and was educated at St Comans, Roscommon. In 1912 he married Henrietta Hill, daughter of Thomas Scott of Hannaville, Greenisland, Co. Antrim. Hayden founded the Westmeath Examiner in 1882, when he was not yet 20. In his early days he also made valuable contributions to Irish literature. He was an active campaigner during the Land War and Plan of Campaign of the 1880s. Like his older brother Luke Hayden, MP for South Leitrim and later for South Roscommon, John Hayden supported Charles Stewart Parnell during the split in the Irish nationalist movement from 1890 over Parnell's leadership. As a result, the Westmeath Examiner was subjected to a clerically organized boycott, and only survived commercially through a pact between Unionists and Parnellites on the Mullingar Board of Guardians, dividing advertising between pro-Parnellite and Unionist papers and excluding the clericalist Westmeath Independent. On Luke's unexpected death in 1897, John Hayden was adopted as the Parnellite candidate to succeed him at South Roscommon. He was returned unopposed at the ensuing by-election and remained unopposed in the same seat at each succeeding general election until 1918, when he was defeated by the prominent Sinn F√©iner Harry Boland by 10,685 votes to 4,233. Fitzpatrick (2003, pp. 109‚Äì12) gives a vivid account of the turbulent election campaign at South Roscommon in 1918. In spite of his role as a land campaigner, in the early 1900s Hayden was himself the target for hostile agitation headed by Laurence Ginnell, who saw him as symbolising the Irish Party's hypocritical tolerance of ‚Äògrazing‚Äô, the operation of large tracts of land for cattle-rearing rather than as smaller holdings for poorer farmers. Hayden was a close associate of the leader of the Irish Party, John Redmond. He was consulted by Redmond before he made his historic statement in the British House of Commons in August 1914 committing Irish Volunteer support for Britain and her Allies and in the First World War. He was also one of the committee of six who drafted the Irish Parliamentary Party manifesto for the 1918 general election. After his Parliamentary defeat, Hayden continued to take an active part in the editorship of the Westmeath Examiner until a fortnight before his death. By the time Hayden died at the age of 91 in July 1954, he was thought to be the last survivor of the Irish Parliamentary Party which had dominated Irish politics up to 1918 (but see entry on Patrick Whitty).

Background In 1957, Pinget, who at the time was close friends with Beckett, undertook a translation of Beckett's radio play All That Fall, which found Beckett's approval. In 1960 Pinget's play Lettre Morte was presented on a double bill with Krapp's Last Tape at the Th√©√¢tre R√©camier in Paris. When Randolph Goodman interviewed the French playwright in 1967, Pinget explained that Beckett : ‚Äúoffered to put my play into English. As he only translates his own material, I considered his offer a great kindness. Beckett wanted to set the scene of the play in Dublin and turn my Parisians into Irishmen; I gave him my permission to do so. It is a model translation.‚ÄùGoodman, R., (Ed.)

Beckett already admired Pinget's work ‚Äì he had, for example, insisted that his friends. the Reaveys attend a performance of the French production on which he had been working ‚Äì and ‚Äúused to cite this play as an illustration of how important the proper use of music could be to a playwright, especially one who was cognizant of the importance of unifying the two disciples.‚ÄùBair, D., Samuel Beckett: A Biography (London: Vintage, 1990), p 585 ‚ÄúBy transforming the French into Irish rhythmic prose, Beckett went beyond translation to make the play his own, although it is less elusive than the drama which constitutes his fully original work. It is easy to see what attracted him to the text, two men on the margins of society, facing isolation and semantic memory loss, which disrupts communication.‚ÄùBrown, V., Yesterday‚Äôs Deformities: A Discussion of the Role of Memory and Discourse in the Plays of Samuel Beckett , (doctoral thesis) Synopsis The play opens to the sound of street noises. An old organ grinder, Gorman, is having a fight with his equally dilapidated barrel organ. It plays for a bit, he thumps it; it plays a few bars more and then it gives up the ghost. He curses, fiddles with the workings and gets a bit more life out of it. As he manages this, he hears another's voice calling him. It is his old friend, Cream, whom he has not seen in years. Cream, a widower, had been living with one of his daughters, Daisy, but since her death, he has moved in with the other, Bertha. Gorman's wife is still alive. Both men are in their seventies: Gorman, by far the more inquisitive of the two, is seventy-three; Cream is seventy-six. The roar of an engine butts into their conversation, the first of many to come. They both bemoan the youth of today and remember a time before cars. Gorman remembers ‚Äúbarouches‚Äù. Cream recalls ‚Äúbroughams‚Äù. They can't agree over the make of the first car they actually did see: Gorman thinks it was a ‚ÄúPic-Pic‚Äù but Cream insists it was a ‚ÄúDee Dyan Button‚Äù. Each man extols his recollected details with utter conviction. They do, however, manage to agree upon the owner of the said vehicle, a vintner called Bush. The effect of modern life on the environment takes the men back to a particularly hot summer in 1895. Gorman talks about watering the roof with a garden hose but Cream insists a hose would have been a luxury item until after World War I. Gorman accedes, acknowledging that his family didn't even having running water until 1925. They move onto the condition of modern gardens especially the prevalent trend for erecting gazebos, the build quality of which they both find to be questionable. Cream proposes they have a smoke, but can't find his cigarettes, accuses his daughter of going through his pockets, then comes across the packet. Neither man has a light however. They try to catch the eye of a passer-by but with no joy. Gorman asks Cream if he remembers the ‚Äúblack shag‚Äù they used to get when they were in the armed forces. He does. Predictably they begin to reminisce about the War. Gorman says he enlisted in 1906 with ‚ÄúThe Foot‚Äù at Chatham. He calls to mind a public house called Morrison's. Cream says he must be mistaken, it was Caterham and the pub was Harrison's Oak Lounge; he is doubly sure of this because he used to take his wife there on holiday. Gorman gives way on the pub's name but is still convinced it was Chatham. Cream refuses to cave, insisting that ‚ÄúThe Gunners‚Äù were billeted at Chatham. The two become muddled. Cream is sure that Gorman is thinking about the mobilization. It that were the case the place name would be Chester which is where Morrison's pub seemingly was. * By ‚ÄúThe Foot‚Äù, Gorman may mean, the Irish Guards, one of the regiments of foot guards in the British Army. * The ‚ÄúGunners‚Äù could refer to The Royal Artillery. * There has been a Naval Barracks in Chatham since 1588 * From 1877 Caterham Barracks was a depot for the foot guards regiments. * Dale Barracks, Chester is a purpose built Infantry Barracks. They are both more alone than they want to admit, struggling to remember, fighting to find common ground and yet even when they seem to it turns into a new battlefield for these two but they keep soldiering on. Gorman becomes nostalgic for the War: ‚Äú[A]h those are happy memories.‚ÄùBeckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 182 Clearly Cream's remembrances are not as ‚Äòrose tinted‚Äô though but he won't even give in on this generality. The roar of an engine distracts them and the next thing he knows Gorman has changed the subject: he is asking after Cream's son, who is a judge. The judge, it turns out, is plagued by rheumatism, which in Gorman's opinion is an hereditary disease. Cream can't agree saying that personally he has never been troubled by it. From all accounts Gorman is thinking about his own mother, even though he is doesn't actually suffer himself either; his assertions are mere opinion presented as fact. He wonders though about a society that can build ‚Äúatom rockets‚Äù and yet has still to discover a cure for rheumatic disorders. He notes that Cream's son has been in the newspapers recently concerning the ‚ÄúCarlton affair‚Äù. Cream corrects him. It was the ‚ÄúBarton affair.‚Äù Gorman is not convinced. He insists: ‚ÄúThe Carlton affair, Mr Cream, the sex fiend, on the Assizes.‚ÄùBeckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 183 Cream says his son works for the Circuit Court ‚Äì which deals with civil, rather than criminal, cases ‚Äì and tries to think of the name of the judge who has been presiding over this high-profile case but can't. Gorman obviously is not well informed on legal issues and admits it; his only experience of judicial matters has been to witnesses his niece's divorce proceedings some thirty years earlier. They begin to talk about families. Cream's grandson, Herbert ‚Äì the judge's son ‚Äì died in infancy; his daughter has two daughters of her own though. It's at this point Gorman learns that Cream's wife has been dead for twenty years. Gorman gets confused about the names of Cream's daughters, Daisy and Bertha, and where Bertha and her husband live. Gorman thinks they live near the slaughterhouse but Cream says Gorman must be thinking of the man's brother, the nurseryman. This contradicts what he himself said earlier when he referred to Bertha's husband, a man called Moody, as a nurseryman. He also now states she has two sons, one of which he calls Hubert confusing the boy with Herbert the boy his son, the judge, lost in infancy. He can't remember the name of his other grandson. Footsteps approach and Gorman tries to get them a light, unsuccessfully again. The conversation shifts onto financial matters. Gorman has always believed that Cream's daughter, whom he mistakenly calls his daughter-in-law, had ‚Äúprivate means‚ÄùBeckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 185 but it seems not; despite advise to invest in land, all the money had been put into the bank and lost during the War. Cream jokes that one day people will be building on the moon, which causes Gorman to wonder if Cream is ‚Äúagainst progress.‚ÄùBeckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 186 He says not but thinks it lunacy to waste resources on the moon and can envisage nations fighting over it in years to come. For some reason this reminds Cream of his father. Gorman says he knew him to be a straight-talking man. He tries to remember when the man sat on the town council and plumps for 1895, ‚Äúthe year of the great frost‚Äù. Cream corrects him, it was 1893, the year he'd just turned ten. Gorman doesn't object and proceeds with his recollection of the time Cream's father ‚Äúwent hell for leather for the mayor‚Äù,Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), pp 186,187 a man called Overend, which he now asserts was in April 1896 despite Cream insisting that his father didn't join the council till January 1897. Gorman then says that the event he was referring to must have been instigated by another person altogether. It transpires the incident didn't involve the mayor at all; rather it was something to do with a local butcher, Oscar Bliss. This causes the men to reminisce over people they used to know in the past: Helen Bliss, the butcher's daughter; Rosie Plumpton, now deceased; Molly Berry; Eva Hart, whose brother married Gertie Crumplin who, in her day, had been a ‚Äúgreat one for the lads‚Äù;Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 187 Nelly Crowther, the daughter of Simon and Mary, who died in an explosion in a car along which injured a soldier, John Fitzball; John's aunt, ‚Äúthe high and mighty‚ÄùBeckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 189 Miss Hester, and her niece, Miss Victoria, who was due to marry an American and who had a brother ‚Äì the aforementioned John ‚Äì who died of injuries sustained from the explosion a year or two later. Throughout their conversation the roar of engines has continually interrupted them. Cream has had enough and prepares to go, aware that he's keeping Gorman from his work. Gorman persuades him to stay and starts looking for his cigarettes. Cream says he should start his barrel organ again which he does. For a few moments it fights with the street noise and then rises triumphantly at the end of the play. Interpretation Beckett draws heavily on the stylized language of John Millington Synge, who had a similar upbringing to his, and the verbal excesses of Se√°n O'Casey, whose background could hardly have been different, to transform Pinget's original work into a pastiche, if not a parody of the whole Irish comic tradition of linguistic stereotyping; the Irishman as caricature. In 1934, Beckett, in a review of O‚ÄôCasey's Windfalls, which includes two one-act plays, writes: : ‚ÄúMr O‚ÄôCasey is a master of knockabout in this very serious and honorable sense ‚Äì that he discerns the principle of disintegration in even the most complacent solidities, and activates it to their explosion.\\"Beckett, S., ‚ÄòThe Essential and the Incidental‚Äô in Disjecta: Miscellaneous Writings and a Dramatic Fragment(London: Calder Publications, 1983), p 82 Gorman and Cream's worlds are crumbling around them just as their pasts and memories are doing. Their speech is colloquial, their outlook parochial. The modern world is passing them by ‚Äì literally ‚Äì motor vehicles and the young on the street. Despite Beckett's conscious efforts to Gaelicise the work the themes at its core are universal. Gorman's line, ‚ÄúYou had to work for your living in those days, it wasn‚Äôt at six you knocked off, nor at seven neither, eight it was, eight o‚Äôclock, yes by God,‚ÄùBeckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 179 could be slipped almost unnoticed into the Four Yorkshiremen sketch ‚Äì made famous by Monty Python ‚Äì or just as easily Neil Simon‚Äôs The Sunshine Boys. There is a clear contrast between O‚ÄôCasey‚Äôs linguistic pyrotechnics and the limited, impoverished lives of the characters that utter his rich hyperbole; the result is both comic and tragic but it is clear that Beckett is in his debt. There is a touch of personal nostalgia here too: Beckett makes specific reference to the \\"Dee Dyan Button,\\" the first car that Cream and Gorman ever saw, which was actually the De Dion-Bouton; Beckett's father was the first to own one in Ireland. It is the kind of detail Mercier and Camier could easily have squabbled about on their trek through and round about Dublin. Critics tend to by-pass the piece, treating it as Beckett- lite, which in many ways it is, but it also demonstrates something of a nostalgic looking-back from Beckett's own point of view, not simply to the Dublin he once knew but to a style of writing that he would never return to again after this year, 1960, the same year he completed his own Happy Days. If ever John Donne had in mind some specific ‚Äúemergent occasion‚Äù then this was probably the last thing he would have thought of: two men, each waiting for their own particular ‚Äúbell [to] toll‚Äù, each ‚Äúan island, entire of itself‚Äù shouting across the strait to another man on another island barely able to hear a word the other is saying.All quotes from Donne, J., Devotions upon Emergent Occasions, Section XVII Stage productions The play was adapted to the stage shortly after publication in Evergreen Review 5.17, (March‚ÄìApril 1961) and first presented off-Broadway at the Royal Playhouse, New York City on 23 March 1961, directed by Steve Chernak with Sly Travers (Gorman) and Jack Delmonte (Cream). The play was not well received, apart from a review in The Village Voice by John Talmer: : \\"The daily critics have put it down and so I suppose it shall die, but The Old Tune, by Robert Pinget in a translation- adaptation by Samuel Beckett ‚Äì more Beckett than Pinget I hazard ‚Äì is a telling if slender piece of work. Death becomes it well: its subject matter is ageing and death, desuetude and deliquescence. But also memory and fondness, loving and nostalgia ‚Äì and the foolish-fondness of old men straining with weak memories, full of error, for the pictures and pleasures of the past.\\"Talmer, J., The Village Voice, 30 March 1961. Quoted in Goodman, R., (Ed.) From Script to Stage: Eight Modern Plays (San Francisco: Rinehart, 1971), p 546 The play did not die, however. * Pinget's original La Manivelle opened at the Th√©√¢tre de la Com√©die, Paris.

He designed and manufactured the first airplane in Turkey, and also founded the country's first airline company.  Biography  A portrait of Vecihi H√ºrku≈ü. Born in Istanbul in 1896. His father was customs inspector Feham Bey, his mother was Zeliha Niyir, born in Vidin. His father died when he was 3 years old. He went to elementary school in Bebek, F√ºyuzati Osmaniye R√º≈ütiye (middle school) in Uskudar and Pa≈üakapƒ±sƒ± ƒ∞dadi (high school). Then he finished Tophane Art School. When Balkan War started, he joined as volunteer. Upon his return, he was assigned as the commander of a POW camp in Beykoz. Then during World War I, in early 1916, he was sent to, Bagdat, during Mesopotamia Campaign as a mechanichttps://www.fikriyat.com/biyografi/2018/07/16/havacilikta-ilklerin- adami-vecihi-hurkus. He was sent back to Istanbul after he was injured. He subsequently joined Tayyare Mektebi, the Ottoman aviation school in Ye≈üilk√∂y. His first solo flight was on 21 May 1916. Soon after receiving his pilot certificate he joined 7th airplane company (Tayyare B√∂l√ºƒü√º) and commenced bombing and reconnaissance missions against the Russians on the Caucasus front. In one of these sorties, he shot down a Russian airplane, becoming the first Turkish pilot to bring down an enemy aircraft. He was subsequently taken prisoner by the Russians but managed to escape from Nargin island to Iran by swimming with Azeri help and walking for over two months. Following his escape, he returned to Istanbul and joined the 9th combat aircraft squadron in 1918, assigned to protection of Istanbul from aerial attacks by Allies. He designed a fighter airplane but could not finish the project due to the terms contained within the Montreux Ceasefire Agreement. During the Turkish War of Independence, in which he flew as a \\"civilian pilot\\", he held the equivalent rank of Captain. During this time he shot down a Greek airplane,http://www.kokpit.aero/index.php?route=article/article&article;_id=4387 and made the first and last flights of the war. In the last flight, he landed at ƒ∞zmir Seydik√∂y Airfield, occupying it single-handedly. After the war, he designed and built his first airplane and a few other aircraft inside a converted saw mill which he had rented. He used aircraft engines he had acquired during World War I to power these planes. In 1924 he built a military aircraft from scratch in Izmir, Vecihi K-VI, which made its first flight on 28 January 1925. In 1930 he constructed a speedboat (Vecihi-SK-X) and a civilian aircraft (Vecihi K-XIV) in Kadƒ±k√∂y, Istanbul, followed by a seaplane in 1933. On 21 April 1932, he established a civilian flying school, Vecihi Sivil Tayyare Mektebi, in Kadƒ±k√∂y. The following year he trained the first Turkish female aviator, Bedriye Bacƒ± (G√∂kmen). He adopted the surname H√ºrku≈ü (\\"Freebird\\") after the Surname Law of 1934. On 27 February 1939 he received a diploma in aircraft engineering from the Weimar Engineering School in Germany. In 1948 he established a privately-funded aviation publication entitled Kanatlƒ±lar Dergisi. On 29 November 1954 he founded H√ºrku≈ü Havayollari (Freebird Airlines), the first private airline in Turkey. From 1961 to 1966 he conducted aerial surveys for the Mining Research Institute. = Aviation contributions = Vecihi H√ºrku≈ü with his aircraft. Monument to Vecihi H√ºrku≈ü in Kƒ±zƒ±ltoprak, Kadƒ±k√∂y Istanbul. In 1917, H√ºrku≈ü became the first Turkish aviator to fly a twin-engine aircraft, a Russian Caudron G.4 captured at the Caucasian Front. In 1918 he manufactured a propeller from scratch in Istanbul, for a Nieuport 17 also captured from the Russians. During the Turkish War of Independence he produced adhesive from gelatin to glue fabric to aircraft wings. In 1923, in Edirne, H√ºrku≈ü flew an abandoned Italian Caproni Ca.5 aka Ca.57 or Breda M-1 with nine passengers, the first Turkish pilot to fly a passenger aircraft. He constructed the country's first gliders (US‚Äì4 ve PS‚Äì2), and played a role in the establishment of the Turkish Birdhttps://www.thk.org.tr/ (Turkish Aviation Society) from 1935 to 1936 in Etimesgut, Ankara. During his flying career, which spanned 52 years (1916‚Äì1967), Vecihi H√ºrku≈ü flew a total of 102 different models of aircraft and spent 30,000 hours (3.4 years) in the cockpit.  Personal life  During the War of Independence, Vecihi married Hadiye, the daughter of the chief of police in Ak≈üehir. They had two daughters, G√∂n√ºl (H√ºrku≈ü ≈ûarman) and Sevim (H√ºrkus Maxson). In 1925, he divorced Hadiye and married his childhood sweetheart ƒ∞hsan. Another daughter, Perran (√úlgen-H√ºrku≈ü), was born in 1927.  Legacy  In 1994, H√ºrku≈ü was honoured posthumously with the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) 50th Anniversary Award for his contributions to civil aviation in Turkey.

By the commuter platform is a third track on the northwest side that allows freight traffic to bypass the platform tracks. History First pair of platforms for light rail under construction. The first railroad tracks in Minneapolis on the west bank of the Mississippi were placed in this location by the St. Paul and Pacific Railroad which later became the Great Northern Railway. The Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway and Great Northern Railway laid parallel east/west tracks in this location platted as Dakota Avenue/4th Avenue between 3rd Street North and 5th Street North. The Minneapolis and St. Louis Track was the southern track and the Great Northern track was the northern track. This grade separation was agreed in 1890 after much litigation. The rail bed was lowered to form what is known as \\"The Cut\\" below the street grade today.Minneapolis Warehouse District Designation Study. City of Minneapolis, Planning commission. October 2009 The station is near the sites of other former Minneapolis railroad depots. The first rail depot in downtown Minneapolis, for the St. Paul and Pacific, was located east near the present-day Fourth Street along the same tracks. The Minneapolis and St. Louis railway freight and passenger depots were located at the East side of Washington Avenue, also east of the present Target Field station. The Electric Short Line Railway (Luce Line) depot was located at the northwest corner of 7th St. North and 3rd Avenue North. It was shared with the Minneapolis, St. Paul, Rochester and Dubuque Electric Traction Company (known as the Dan Patch Line and later the Minneapolis, Northfield and Southern Railway), as well as the Minneapolis, Anoka and Cuyuna Range Interurban railway. =2009 station= Metro Transit's first new Siemens S70, #201, arrives at a 2012 unveiling to the news media at the 2009 platforms at Target Field station. It bears Green Line signage, though this was months before the Green Line opened. The station was opened in 2009, to serve Northstar Commuter Rail and the Hiawatha Line, now METRO Blue Line. The light rail line was extended from its existing terminus at Warehouse District / Hennepin Avenue to serve the new station. The Minnesota Twins pledged $2.6 million for its construction.Paul Levy and Joy Powell, Finally, all aboard Northstar rail, Star Tribune, December 10, 2007. =2014 addition= The 2014 addition was designed by New York-based Perkins Eastman, to provide additional platform space for both METRO Green and Blue Lines, as well as provide community gathering space. Future plans The Green Line extension, also known as the Southwest Corridor to Eden Prairie and the Blue Line extension, also known as the Bottineau Boulevard to Brooklyn Park will serve Target Field. The Northern Lights Express to Duluth would originate at Target Field. Potential regional rail routes from Target Field station include the Dakota Rail Corridor to Hutchinson, the Dan Patch Corridor to Northfield, the Little Crow Line to Willmar, the Red Rock Corridor to Hastings, and the Minnesota Prairie Line to Norwood Young America. Operation Light rail trains from both Blue and Green Lines serve both the 2009 and 2014 platforms. Each train makes two stops at the station to serve both sets of platforms. The Northstar Commuter Rail one-way fares from this station range from $1.00 to $3.25 on weekdays and $1.00 to $2.75 on weekends, depending on the destination.https://www.metrotransit.org/fares#Northstarfares The Northstar Line provides five morning and five afternoon trips each weekday.

Written by Shane Rimmer and directed by Leo Eaton, it was first broadcast on 26 March 1968 on ATV Midlands. In this episode, the Mysterons steal a nuclear reactor as part of a plot to devastate the Atlantic Seaboard of North America. Plot In Quebec, Canada, a nuclear reactor is being shipped to the Manicougan Power Complex by transporter truck. Captain Black (voiced by Donald Gray) switches a road sign to divert the driver onto an unfinished bridge, sending the transporter crashing into a canyon. The Mysterons (voiced by Donald Gray) reconstruct the driver, the transporter and the reactor as part of a plan to damage Earth's prestige by devastating the Atlantic Seaboard of North America. Elsewhere, a fleet of remote-controlled Seneca helicopters is ferrying construction materials to the future site of the Expo 2068 world's fair. Infiltrating the Seneca control tower, Black holds the helicopter operator at gunpoint, forcing him to divert one of the helicopters to a forest clearing. There, the transporter driver loads the reactor into the helicopter's wooden holding crate. While transferring the reactor he is discovered by a passing lumberjack, whom he shoots and leaves for dead. While chasing the transporter in a Spectrum Pursuit Vehicle, Captains Scarlet and Blue (voiced by Francis Matthews and Ed Bishop) come across the wounded lumberjack and have him taken to hospital. They discover that the reactor's thermal safety valve has been removed and that without it, the reactor will overheat and explode. They resume their pursuit and the transporter driver, desperate to evade Spectrum, is killed when he crashes his vehicle. With the reactor nowhere to be found, Scarlet and Blue remember that the lumberjack kept muttering the word \\"Seneca\\", and speed to the Expo 2068 site. At the site, Black instructs the operator to position the helicopter directly over the Expo tower. When Scarlet and Blue arrive, Black orders the operator crash the helicopter, but the operator refuses. Black shoots him, also hitting the controls and disrupting the helicopter's flight pattern. Wearing a jet pack, Scarlet flies up to the helicopter with a saw and cuts his way into the holding crate, where he finds that the reactor has reached critical temperature. He is crushed by the reactor but succeeds in stabilising it by disconnecting the external circuits; however, he is killed shortly after when the helicopter crashes into a building and explodes. In the final scene, Blue flies Scarlet's body back to Cloudbase. Production \\"Expo 2068\\" was filmed between October and November 1967 on Century 21 Studios' Stage 4. It was the last episode of Captain Scarlet to be shot on that stage; the next production to go before the Stage 4 unit was \\"The Most Special Agent\\", the first episode of Joe 90. The script included several scenes that were shortened or removed to prevent the episode from over-running. One of the deleted scenes shows Scarlet and Blue obtaining their SPV (which is stated to be number 442) from a village shop whose owner is shown dressed in nightclothes and a baseball cap. Two expository scenes ‚Äì one explaining the purpose of the nuclear reactor, the other the history of the Manicougan Power Complex ‚Äì were also removed, and some of Blue's dialogue in the final scene was cut. The script also clarified the Mysterons' objectives, with Colonel White (voiced by Donald Gray) realising that they intend to carry out their threat to lower Earth's prestige by crashing the reactor into Expo 2068, causing a nuclear explosion. This line of dialogue was cut, with the result that in the finished episode the target is implied to be the Manicougan Power Complex. According to the script, Expo 2068 is \\"equivalent to our World's Fair but on an enormous scale\\". The transporter model and the reactor prop both previously appeared in \\"Big Ben Strikes Again\\". The incidental music for \\"Expo 2068\\" was the last to be produced for the series. It was recorded during a four-hour studio session held on 3 December 1967, where it was performed by an ensemble of 14 instrumentalists. Music for \\"Attack on Cloudbase\\" had been recorded earlier in the session. The Captain Scarlet music CD release includes a track from \\"Expo 2068\\" titled \\"The Reactor\\". Reception Shane M. Dallmann of Video Watchdog magazine calls \\"Expo 2068\\" a \\"standout episode ‚Äì and not just from a dramatic standpoint\\". Though unimpressed with the miniature model of the Seneca helicopter's crate, he comments that the scene of Scarlet sawing his way inside \\"reveals an amazing level of concentration, skill and dexterity behind the camera.\\" Andrew Pixley and Julie Rogers of Starburst magazine consider the scene of Scarlet being crushed by the reactor to be one of the series' more violent moments.

He started Cornell University in 1970 and received an AB in 1973 \\"Cum Laude with Honors in All Subjects\\" and Phi Beta Kappa, Master's in 1976 and PhD in 1978. He has held positions at The Rockefeller University, Carnegie-Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh (since 1984), where he is currently Professor of Mathematics. He was born in Turkey, and spent his first seven years and ages 13‚Äì16 there, and the middle years in New York City. Caginalp was married in 1992 to Eva. They have three sons, Carey, Reggie and Ryan. He served as the Editor of the Journal of Behavioral Finance (1999‚Äì2003), and is an Associate Editor for numerous journals. He has been the recipient of National Science Foundation and private foundation awards.  Summary of Research  Caginalp is known mainly for developing the phase field approach to interface problems, and for pioneering mathematical modeling to understand the dynamics of financial markets beyond valuation. Currently the key areas of Caginalp's work involve quantitative behavioral finance, phase field models, and renormalization methods in differential equations. His initial research focused on rigorous equilibrium statistical mechanics, particularly surface free energy. He also worked on nonlinear hyperbolic differential equations. Articles on his research have appeared in the New York Times, Science and other publications. Science article.  Thesis and related research  Caginalp's PhD in Applied Mathematics at Cornell University (with thesis advisor Professor Michael Fisher) focused on surface free energy. Previous results by David Ruelle, Fisher, and Elliot Lieb in the 1960s had established that the free energy of a large system can be written as a product of the volume times a term f_{\\\\infty} (free energy per unit volume) that is independent of the size of the system, plus smaller terms. A remaining problem was to prove that there was a similar term associated with the surface. This was more difficult since the f_{\\\\infty} proofs relied on discarding terms that were proportional to the surface. A key result of Caginalp's thesis [1,2,3] is the proof that the free energy, F, of a lattice system occupying a region \\\\Omega with volume \\\\Omega and surface area \\\\partial\\\\Omega can be written as F(\\\\Omega)=\\\\Omegaf_\\\\infty+\\\\partial\\\\Omegaf_x+... with f_x is the surface free energy (independent of \\\\Omega and \\\\partial\\\\Omega ). Shortly after his PhD, Caginalp joined the Mathematical Physics group of James Glimm (2002 National Medal of Science recipient) at The Rockefeller University. In addition to working on mathematical statistical mechanics, he also proved existence theorems on nonlinear hyperbolic differential equations describing fluid flow. These papers were published in the Annals of Physics and the Journal of Differential Equations.  Developing phase field models  In 1980, Caginalp was the first recipient of the Zeev Nehari position established at Carnegie-Mellon University's Mathematical Sciences Department. At that time he began working on free boundary problems, e.g., problems in which there is an interface between two phases that must be determined as part of the solution to the problem. His original paper on this topic is the second most cited paper in a leading journal, Archive for Rational Mechanics and Analysis, during the subsequent quarter century. He has published over fifty papers on the phase field equations in mathematics, physics and materials journals. The focus of research in the mathematics and physics communities changed considerably during this period, and this perspective is widely used to derive macroscopic equations from a microscopic setting, as well as performing computations on dendritic growth and other phenomena. In the mathematics community during the previous century, the interface between two phases was generally studied via the Stefan model, in which temperature played a dual role, as the sign of the temperature determined the phase, so the interface is defined as the set of points at which the temperature is zero. Physically, however, the temperature at the interface was known to be proportional to the curvature, thereby preventing the temperature from fulfilling its dual role of the Stefan model. This suggested that an additional variable would be needed for a complete description of the interface. In the physics literature, the idea of an \\"order parameter\\" and mean field theory had been used by Landau in the 1940s to describe the region near the critical point (i.e., the region in which the liquid and solid phases become indistinguishable). However, the calculation of exact exponents in statistical mechanics showed that mean field theory was not reliable. There was speculation in the physics community that such a theory could be used to describe an ordinary phase transition. However, the fact that the order parameter could not produce the correct exponents in critical phenomena for which it was invented led to skepticism that it could produce results for normal phase transitions. The justification for an order parameter or mean field approach had been that the correlation length between atoms approaches infinity near the critical point. For an ordinary phase transition, the correlation length is typically just a few atomic lengths. Furthermore, in critical phenomena one is often trying to calculate the critical exponents, which should be independent of the details of the system (often called \\"universality\\"). In a typical interface problem, one is trying to calculate the interface position essentially exactly, so that one cannot \\"hide behind universality\\". In 1980 there seemed to be ample reason to be skeptical of the idea that an order parameter could be used to describe a moving interface between two phases of a material. Beyond the physical justifications, there remained issues related to the dynamics of an interface and the mathematics of the equations. For example, if one uses an order parameter, \\\\phi, together with the temperature variable, T, in a system of parabolic equations, will an initial transition layer in \\\\phi, describing the interface remain as such? One expects that will vary from -1 to +1 as one moves from the solid to the liquid and that the transition will be made on a spatial scale of \\\\varepsilon, the physical thickness of the interface. The interface in the phase field system is then described by the level set of points on which \\\\phi vanishes. The simplest model [4] can be written as a pair (\\\\phi,T) that satisfies the equations \\\\begin{array}{lcl} C_{P}T_{t}+\\\\frac{l}{2}\\\\phi = K\\\\Delta T \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\alpha\\\\varepsilon^2 \\\\phi_t = \\\\varepsilon^2 \\\\Delta\\\\phi + \\\\frac{1}{2}(\\\\phi-\\\\phi^3)+\\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon[s]_E}{3\\\\sigma}(T-T_E) \\\\end{array} where C_{P}, l, \\\\alpha, \\\\sigma, [s]_{E} are physically measurable constants, and \\\\varepsilon is the interface thickness. With the interface described as the level set of points where the phase variable vanishes, the model allows the interface to be identified without tracking, and is valid even if there are self-intersections. = Modeling = Using the phase field idea to model solidification so that the physical parameters could be identified was originally undertaken in [4]. = Alloys = A number of papers in collaboration with Weiqing Xie* and James Jones [5,6] have extended the modeling to alloy solid-liquid interfaces. = Basic theorems and analytical results = Initiated during the 1980s, these include the following. * Given a set of physical parameters describing the material, namely latent heat, surface tension, etc., there is a phase field system of equations whose solutions formally approach those of the corresponding sharp interface system [4,7]. In fact it has been proven that a broad spectrum of interface problems are distinguished limits of the phase field equations. These include the classical Stefan model, the Cahn-Hilliard model, and motion by mean curvature. Phase figure * There exists a unique solution to this system of equations and the interface width is stable in time [4]. = Computational results = The earliest qualitative computations were done in collaboration with J.T. Lin in 1987. * Since the true interface thickness, \\\\varepsilon, is atomic length, realistic computations did not appear feasible without a new ansatz. One can write the phase field equations in a form where Œµ is the interface thickness and d_0 the capillarity length (related to the surface tension), so that it is possible to vary \\\\varepsilon as a free parameter without varying d_0 if the scaling is done appropriately [4]. * One can increase the size of epsilon and not change the motion of the interface significantly provided that d_0 is fixed [8]. This means that computations with real parameters are feasible. * Computations in collaboration with Dr. Bilgin Altundas* compared the numerical results with dendritic growth in microgravity conditions on the space shuttle [9]. = Phase field models of second order = As phase field models became a useful tool in materials science, the need for even better convergence (from the phase field to the sharp interface problems) became apparent. This led to the development of phase field models of second order, meaning that as the interface thickness, \\\\varepsilon, becomes small, the difference in the interface of the phase field model and the interface of the related sharp interface model become second order in interface thickness, i.e., \\\\varepsilon^2. In collaboration with Dr. Christof Eck, Dr. Emre Esenturk* and Profs. Xinfu Chen and Caginalp developed a new phase field model and proved that it was indeed second order [10, 11,12]. Numerical computations confirmed these results.  Application of renormalization group methods to differential equations  The philosophical perspective of the renormalization group (RG) initiated by Ken Wilson in the 1970s is that in a system with large degrees of freedom, one should be able to repeatedly average and adjust, or renormalize, at each step without changing the essential feature that one is trying to compute. In the 1990s Nigel Goldenfeld and collaborators began to investigate the possibility of using this idea for the Barenblatt equation. Caginalp further developed these ideas so that one can calculate the decay (in space and time) of solutions to a heat equation with nonlinearity [13] that satisfies a dimensional condition. The methods were also applied to interface problems and systems of parabolic differential equations with Huseyin Merdan*.  Research in behavioral finance and experimental economics  Caginalp has been a leader in the newly developing field of Quantitative Behavioral Finance. The work has three main facets: (1) statistical time series modeling, (2) mathematical modeling using differential equations, and (3) laboratory experiments; comparison with models and world markets. His research is influenced by decades of experience as an individual investor and trader. = Statistical time series modeling = The efficient market hypothesis (EMH) has been the dominant theory for financial markets for the past half century. It stipulates that asset prices are essentially random fluctuations about their fundamental value. As empirical evidence, its proponents cite market data that appears to be \\"white noise\\". Behavioral finance has challenged this perspective, citing large market upheavals such as the high-tech bubble and bust of 1998-2003, etc. The difficulty in establishing the key ideas of behavioral finance and economics has been the presence of \\"noise\\" in the market. Caginalp and others have made substantial progress toward this surmounting this key difficulty. An early study by Caginalp and Constantine in 1995 showed that using the ratio of two clone closed-end funds, one can remove the noise associated with valuation. They showed that today's price is not likely to be yesterday's price (as indicated by EMH), or a pure continuation of the change during the previous time interval, but is halfway between those prices. Subsequent work with Ahmet Duran* [14] examined the data involving large deviations between the price and net asset value of closed end funds, finding strong evidence that there is a subsequent movement in the opposite direction (suggesting overreaction). More surprisingly, there is a precursor to the deviation, which is usually a result of large changes in price in the absence of significant changes in value. Dr. Vladimira Ilieva and Mark DeSantis* focused on large scale data studies that effectively subtracted out the changes due to the net asset value of closed end funds [15]. Thus one could establish significant coefficients for price trend. The work with DeSantis was particularly noteworthy in two respects: (a) by standardizing the data, it became possible to compare the impact of price trend versus changes in money supply, for example; (b) the impact of the price trend was shown to be nonlinear, so that a small uptrend has a positive impact on prices (demonstrating underreaction), while a large uptrend has a negative influence. The measure of large or small is based upon the frequency of occurrence (measure in standard deviations). Using exchange traded funds (ETFs), they also showed (together with Akin Sayrak) that the concept of resistance‚Äîwhereby a stock has retreats as it nears a yearly high‚Äîhas strong statistical support [16]. The research shows the importance of two key ideas: (i) By compensating for much of the change in valuation, one can reduce the noise that obscures many behavioral and other influence on price dynamics; (ii) By examining nonlinearity (e.g., in the price trend effect) one can uncover influences that would be statistically insignificant upon examining only linear terms. = Mathematical modeling using differential equations = The asset flow differential approach involves understanding asset market dynamics. (I) Unlike the EMH, the model developed by Caginalp and collaborators since 1990 involves ingredients that were marginalized by the classical efficient market hypothesis: while price change depends on supply and demand for the asset (e.g., stock) the latter can depend on a variety of motivations and strategies, such as the recent price trend. Unlike the classical theories, there is no assumption of infinite arbitrage, which says that any small deviation from the true value (that is universally accepted since all participants have the same information) is quickly exploited by an (essentially) infinite capital managed by \\"informed\\" investors. Among the consequences of this theory is that equilibrium is not a unique price, but depends on the price history and strategies of the traders. Classical models of price dynamics are all built on the idea that there is infinite arbitrage capital. The Caginalp asset flow model introduced an important new concept of liquidity, L, or excess cash that is defined to be the total cash in the system divided by the total number of shares. (II) In subsequent years, these asset flow equations were generalized to include distinct groups with differing assessments of value, and distinct strategies and resources. For example, one group may be focused on trend (momentum) while another emphasizes value, and attempts to buy the stock when it is undervalued. (III) In collaboration with Duran these equations were studied in terms of optimization of parameters, rendering them a useful tool for practical implementation. (IV) More recently, David Swigon, DeSantis and Caginalp studied the stability of the asset flow equations and showed that instabilities, for example, flash crashes could occur as a result of traders utilizing momentum strategies together with shorter time scales [17, 18]. In recent years, there has been related work that is sometimes called \\"evolutionary finance\\". = Laboratory experiments; comparison with models and world markets = In the 1980s asset market experiments pioneered by Vernon Smith (2002 Economics Nobel Laureate) and collaborators provided a new tool to study microeconomics and finance. In particular these posed a challenge to classical economics by showing that participants when participants traded (with real money) an asset with a well defined value the price would soar well above the fundamental value that is defined by the experimenters. Repetition of this experiment under various conditions showed the robustness of the phenomenon. By designing new experiments, Profs. Caginalp, Smith and David Porter largely resolved this paradox through the framework of the asset flow equations. In particular, the bubble size (and more generally, the asset price) was highly correlated by the excess cash in the system, and momentum was also shown to be a factor [19]. In classical economics there would be just one quantity, namely the share price that has units of dollars per share. The experiments showed that this is distinct from the fundamental value per share. The liquidity, L, introduced by Caginalp and collaborators, is a third quantity that also has these units [20]. The temporal evolution of prices involves a complex relationship among these three variables, together with quantities reflecting the motivations of the traders that may involve price trend and other factors. Other studies have shown quantitatively that motivations in the experimental traders are similar to those in world markets. \\\\ast \\\\- PhD student of Caginalp  References  # # # # (Earlier version: CMU Preprint 1982) # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # External links * Download papers on economics/finance: http://ssrn.com/author=328612 * List of papers on phase field equations: http://www.pitt.edu/~caginalp/pfpub8_10.pdf * Download all papers from Personal home page * List of publications, 2016 * Publication List * NY Times Article * Newsletter: Quantitative Behavioral Finance Category:Living people Category:American mathematicians Category:American people of Turkish descent Category:Turkish mathematicians Category:Cornell University alumni Category:University of Pittsburgh faculty Category:Financial economists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Gunduz Caginalp"},{"id":"10391183","text":"Elmer T.

He took office on February 16, 1975, succeeding Elmer T. Klassen. Previously, he had served as Senior Assistant Postmaster General, Chief Financial Officer, and Deputy Postmaster General. Career Bailar, a graduate of the Harvard Business School with an extensive background in finance and management, attempted to place the postal service on a strong economic footing. His major responsibility as United States Postmaster General was to ensure that the semi-independent government corporation could support itself on revenues from mail users. Bailar was especially concerned with the quality of mail service and postal costs. One significant cost was labor, and Bailar is probably best known for negotiating an eleventh hour contract which avoided a strike by unionized postal employees in 1975. He was also instrumental in the rate increase of first class stamps to 13 cents, in dealing with CIA mail tampering, and in addressing possible postal cost- cutting which would have resulted in a decline in mail services to some rural areas. Background Bailar was born in Champaign, Illinois on April 21, 1934. After attending public schools and the University of Illinois Lab School in his home town, Bailar attended the University of Colorado. Following his graduation in 1955, he served in the U.S. Navy as a Supply Officer before entering the Harvard Business School. He received his Masters in Business Administration in 1959. Bailar is also the recipient of honorary degrees from Monmouth College and the University of Colorado. In addition to his term of service as Postmaster General, Bailar has worked for the Continental Oil Company, American Can Company, and U.S. Gypsum.

He is described as the \\"Father of British Physiology\\". Early life Sharpey was born in Arbroath on 1 April 1802 the youngest son of the five children Mary Balfour and Henry Sharpy (sic), a shipowner from Folkestone who died before Sharpey was born. William was educated at the high school in Arbroath and in November 1817 began studies at the University of Edinburgh, firstly studying humanities and natural philosophy. In 1818 he moved to the medical classes, learning anatomy from Professor John Barclay, who then was lecturing in the extra-academical school. In 1821 Sharpey graduated with an MB ChB and was admitted a member of the Edinburgh College of Surgeons. He then went to London to broaden his anatomical experience in the private school of Joshua Brookes in Blenheim Street. He went to Paris in the autumn, and remained there for nearly a year, learning clinical surgery from Guillaume Dupuytren in the wards of the H√¥tel Dieu, and operative surgery from Jacques Lisfranc de St. Martin. Here he made the acquaintance of James Syme, with whom he kept up a correspondence until Syme's death in 1870. In August 1823 Sharpey was awarded his doctorate (MD) from the University of Edinburgh, with his thesis De Ventriculi Carcinomate, and then returned to Paris, where he spent most of 1824. He then appears to have settled for a time in Arbroath, where he began to practise under his step-father, Dr Arrott; but he then set out on a long hike in Europe, by foot through France to Switzerland, and on to Italy. In 1828 he stayed at Padua to work under Bartolomeo Panizza. He was then in Berlin for nine months working under Karl Rudolphi, and after that was at Heidelberg under Friedrich Tiedemann, and at Vienna. Academic career William Sharpey in 1855 Sharpey established himself in Edinburgh in 1829, and in the following year he obtained the fellowship of the College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, presenting a probationary essay On the Pathology and Treatment of False Joints. The diploma of fellow qualified him to become a teacher in Edinburgh; but in 1831 he again spent three months in Berlin. In 1831‚Äì1832, with Allen Thomson, who taught physiology, he gave a first course of lectures on systematic anatomy in the extramural school in Edinburgh. The association of Sharpey with Thomson lasted during the remainder of Sharpey's stay in Edinburgh. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1834, his proposer being Sir Robert Christison. At this time he lived at 3 Alva Street in Edinburgh's West End.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1833 In July 1836 Sharpey was appointed to the chair of anatomy and physiology in the University of London in succession to Jones Quain. In this capacity Sharpey gave the first complete course of lectures on physiology and minute anatomy. His lectures then continued for 38 years. Sharpey was appointed in 1840 one of the examiners in anatomy at the university of London, and he was also a member of the senate of the University. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 9 May 1839. In 1846 he described the skeletal loadbearing fibres that now bear his name, Sharpey's fibres. He was made a member of its council in 1844, and was appointed one of the secretaries in place of Thomas Bell in November 1853, an office which he held until his retirement. He was also for 15 years, from April 1861, one of the members appointed by the Crown on the general council of medical education and registration. Sharpey was also one of the trustees of the Hunterian Museum in Glasgow. In 1859 he received the honorary doctorate (LLD) for his literary works from the University of Edinburgh. His pupils included Michael Foster, George Oliver, and Burdon Sanderson. Sharpey was a correspondent and friend of Charles Darwin. He was also on the Commission on Scientific Instruction and the Advancement of Science, and was also a Fellow of the Geological Society. Later life Troubled by failure of his eyesight, about 1871 Sharpey retired from the post of secretary of the Royal Society, and in 1874 from his professorship at University College. In 1874 he received a Civil Service pension from the government. He died of bronchitis at 50 Torrington Square, London, on Sunday, 11 April 1880. He was buried with his parents in the graveyard of Arbroath Abbey.

He served as the United States Postmaster General from January 1, 1985 to January 7, 1986. Education Carlin was born in San Diego, California on August 25, 1931.Marquis Who's Who on the Web Carlin received a bachelor's degree from the University of Wyoming in 1954, where he was an all-star track athlete. He served in the United States Army for two years and taught athletics at the University of Baghdad in Iraq as a Fulbright professor. Career During the 1960s, he was employed by the National Association of Counties where he served as assistant director of federal affairs, a position in which he lobbied Congress. He later held a similar position, director of federal and congressional relations, with the National School Boards Association, until 1968. He then joined the National Audio-Visual Association as vice president and educational director. Carlin went into government as President Richard Nixon's liaison with Congress on postal matters. He went on to become a specialist in labor and employee relations at United States Postal Service headquarters, chief of the eastern postal region, and chief of the central postal region. On November 14, 1984, the board of governors of the Postal Service selected Carlin from among 35 candidates to become the Postmaster General effective on January 1, 1985. The Postal Service faced a deficit during Carlin's first fiscal year in office. Between October 1, 1984 (the start of the fiscal year) and July 1, 1985, the Postal Service had a $385 million deficit, due in part to an unanticipated increase in mail volume and changes in airline routes and schedules which required the Postal Service to renegotiate contracts with airlines and reschedule operations. In order to reduce the deficit, Carlin imposed a 3.5% pay cut on 35 top postal executives (including himself), and delayed a scheduled 3.2% pay increase for 714 other managers. Other cost-cutting measures taken by the Postal Service during his administration included cutting back on overtime hours worked and delaying or canceling the issuance of certain stamps. The Postal Service's deficit for the fiscal year as a whole came to $251.5 million. Carlin's service as Postmaster General was cut short after just over a year when the board of governors fired him on January 6, 1986. He was allowed to remain as an adviser to the board of governors at a reduced salary. John McKean, chairman of the board of governors, explained Carlin's firing by saying, \\"The governors felt there was a changing environment that required a different marketplace perspective.\\" Carlin's replacement, Albert V. Casey, related in his memoir the explanations McKean and vice-chairman Peter Voss gave him as to why Carlin was being fired. According to Casey, McKean and Voss told him that Carlin had failed to reduce the number of postal employees, that he had been slow to make decisions about purchasing equipment for automation, that he delegated too much authority, and was too subservient to the White House, in addition to running the $251 million deficit for the fiscal year. In June 1986, Carlin filed suit against the board of governors to get his job as Postmaster General back. Carlin claimed that he had been fired for refusing to steer a contract for sorting equipment to a company favored by Voss, the vice-chairman of the board. (About a month before Carlin filed suit, Voss had pleaded guilty to taking illegal payoffs in relation to the contract and resigned from the board.) However, Carlin's lawsuit was dismissed on the grounds that the Postal Reorganization Act did not allow judicial review of the board's decision to fire a Postmaster General. According to the district court, Congress had granted the board authority to fire a Postmaster General \\"for a good reason, bad reason or no reason at all.\\"Carlin v. McKean, No. 86-1611, mem. op. at 10 (D.D.C. July 18, 1986). Quoted in Carlin v. McKean, 823 F.2d 620, 622 (D.C. Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1046 (1988). Business After leaving the Postal Service, Carlin co-founded (with Eugene C. Johnson) a company called Business Mail Express Inc. in 1990 and sold it in 1995. In 1998, he and Johnson established a company called Mail2000, which was intended to speed mail delivery by helping businesses presort mass mailings. In 2001, United Parcel Service purchased Mail2000 for an estimated $100 million. He died on April 25, 2018, in Arlington, Virginia, from pneumonia and bronchitis at the age of 86.https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/paul-carlin-postmaster- general-who-fought-his-dismissal-dies- at-86/2018/05/16/a4e411e8-584e-11e8-8836-a4a123c359ab_story.html References Category:1931 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Businesspeople from San Diego Category:Military personnel from California Category:University of Wyoming alumni Category:Fulbright Scholars Category:University of Baghdad faculty Category:United States Postmasters General Category:American communications businesspeople ","title":"Paul N.

It was the so-called \\"third component\\" of the Rose in the Fist (RnP), a political alliance composed mainly of the Italian Democratic Socialists (SDI), a social-democratic party, and the Italian Radicals (Rad), a liberal movement. History In the 2006 general election the RnP obtained 2.6% of the vote and 18 deputies. In July 2006 the association was launched in reaction to the crisis that invested the RnP soon after the election, when the federative process between the SDI and Radicals stalled. The group members included Lanfranco Turci (president), Salvatore Buglio, Biagio De Giovanni, Luciano Cafagna and Alberto Benzoni (a SDI member). Most of them were former Democrats of the Left (DS), but, while the first three came from the Italian Communist Party (which had become the Democratic Party of the Left in 1991), Cafagna and Benzoni were former members of the Italian Socialist Party (disbanded in 1994). In 2007 the dissolution of the RnP seemed inevitable, so that Turci and his association started to work with a different direction: uniting all the so-called \\"liberal-socialist\\" forces of Italy in what was named \\"Secular Liberal Socialist Convention\\". This convention was primarily aimed at uniting the SDI, the Radicals, Turci's group and other Socialist associations (e.g. Socialism is Freedom of Rino Formica), but also the New Italian Socialist Party (NPSI), The Italian Socialists (SI), the Reformist Socialists (RS), the Italian Democratic Socialist Party, the European Republicans Movement (MRE), the Federation of Liberals (FdL), former Socialists within the DS (the group around Valdo Spini) and all the members of that party who felt dissatisfied of the formation of the Democratic Party (the left-wing of Fabio Mussi and Cesare Salvi, the group around Gavino Angius and that of Peppino Caldarola and Emanuele Macaluso). In March 2007, during a conference at Bertinoro, the prospect of a new social-democratic party, to be formed on the ashes of both the DS and the SDI, was discussed by Lanfranco Turci and Rino Formica, Peppino Caldarola and Emanuele Macaluso (DS), Enrico Boselli and Roberto Biscardini (SDI), Gianni De Michelis, Alessandro Battilocchio and Mauro Del Bue (NPSI), Bobo Craxi and Saverio Zavettieri (SI), Donato Robilotta (RS), Adriano Musi (MRE) and Enzo Marzo (FdL). In April 2007, at the national congress of SDI, the party launched a similar proposal: a \\"Socialist Constituent Assembly\\", open to all the Italian social democrats and above all to the former members of the old Italian Socialist Party. The proposal was immediately accepted by Lanfranco Turci, Rino Formica, Peppino Caldarola, Emanuele Macaluso, Gianni De Michelis, Alessandro Battilocchio and Mauro Del Bue, Bobo Craxi and Saverio Zavettieri, Valdo Spini and, to some extent, by Gavino Angius and Fabio Mussi, who were all special guests of the congress. The Constituent Assembly was intended to lead to a new social- democratic party (probably named \\"Italian Socialist Party\\"), which would form a federation with the Italian Radicals (whose leader Emma Bonino insisted that \\"the Rose in the Fist\\" was not dead at the congress), the MRE and the FdL. On 5 October 2007 the Association was merged into the newly founded Socialist Party, which was renamed the Italian Socialist Party in 2009.

He was known for his speed and normally played in midfield, though he was also used as a striker or fullback. Youth career White attended The Haverford School for high school, and was a member of the soccer team, earning All- American honors. He also played on the Region I ODP and adidas ESP teams. White played with the youth club FC Delco while in school, and was named the club's player of the year while still a senior in high school. White chose to play collegiate soccer for Wake Forest University, over other top universities such as Duke, Clemson, Maryland, and South Carolina. White played as a forward during his freshman season with the Demon Deacons, scoring his first collegiate goal against UNC-Charlotte, a goal that won that particular match in overtime. White's sophomore season was a success, as he led the ACC in scoring, becoming the first Wake Forest player to do so since 1983. He recorded his first career hat-trick against the University of Richmond during this season. Injury plagued White's junior season at Wake Forest, keeping him out of the starting eleven until October 29. Despite the injuries, White still led the team in scoring, and was named to the All-ACC team for the second year in a row.Wake Forest Biography In 2003, White's senior year, he was named ACC Player of the Year, and was named to the All-ACC team for the third straight year.MatchNight Central Scouting Database Professional career=OFK Beograd= Following graduation from Wake Forest, White went to Europe, in an effort to prove that he could succeed there. He signed with Serbian club OFK Beograd, in January 2004, shunning offers from Major League Soccer, where he had been drafted in the third round of the MLS SuperDraft by the New England Revolution. White's short time with Beograd was marred by a racism incident that occurred in March 2004, and received international media attention. White and a group of friends, including two black Brazilians, were confronted by a group of angry youth, one of whom, according to White, was \\"throwing around Nazi signs.\\" Fierce words were exchanged, punches were thrown, and the groups eventually separated with no serious damage incurred. News organizations like BBC, RAI, and CNN picked up on the story, and White was headline news around the world for a short time. A month later, White asked for, and was granted, release from his contract on April 6, 2004, which led to speculation that White was leaving the team as a result of the incident. White dismissed this, saying, \\"That's the farthest thing from the truth.\\"Yanks Abroad ‚Äì Maybe A Little Too Naive =Panserraikos= After his release from Beograd, White set up a series of trials with clubs throughout Europe, including Dutch club Feyenoord, and Belgian club K.V.C. Westerlo. White was close to having a deal completed with Westerlo, but he instead signed with Greek Second Division side Panserraikos on a one-year contract. White made his debut for the club on September 19, 2004, against AEL. He had a shot stopped by the AEL keeper in the 82nd minute, but the ensuing corner kick led to the match's only goal, scored by Kelvin Sebwe, giving Panserraikos a 1‚Äì0 win. While with Panserraikos, White was frequently played out of position as a target forward, as opposed to his preferred withdrawn striker position. Playing as a target forward is extremely unusual for a player who is only 5 feet, 8 inches tall. In addition, White claimed that the club physically altered his contract after he signed, attempting to claim that he signed for two years instead of one. White was also forced to play through injury, and eventually suffered a severe concussion that kept him out of action for two months. Following his recovery, White asked for, and after a dispute, was granted his release from the club in January 2005. =FC Gueugnon= For the second time in six months, White found himself without a team, and again set up trials across Europe, spending time with FC Nordsjaelland of the Danish Superliga and FC Gueugnon of French Ligue 2.Yanks Abroad ‚Äì White Up For Gueugnon Audition White signed with the French club on June 6, 2005, agreeing to a two-year contract.Yanks Abroad ‚Äì White Pens Gueugnon Pact White spent most of his early time with Gueugnon's reserve team, but eventually got his first goal of his Ligue 2 career on November 25, 2005, scoring the game-winning goal on a free kick from 28 yards out to beat Le Havre AC. Ten games into the season, White led the team in scoring with four goals, yet still failed to see consistent playing time. =AGF Aarhus= White turned his eyes towards Scandinavia, landing trials with Lyn Oslo of the Norwegian Tippeligaen and with AGF Aarhus of the Danish First Division. White agreed to a three-and-a-half year contract with the Danish club on January 28, 2007. The club was relegated from the Danish Superliga in 2006, but after signing players like Olof Persson and K√°ri √Årnason, they were widely expected to make a return to the top flight for the 2007‚Äì08 season.Yanks Abroad ‚Äì White Joins AGF Promotion Fight White made his debut for AGF on April 1, 2007, starting as a midfielder against Fremad Amager. AGF won the match 4‚Äì1, with White scoring his first goal for the club in the 15th minute. AGF secured promotion to the Danish Superliga by beating Kolding 2‚Äì0 on June 17, 2007, with White playing the full 90 minutes. During a friendly against FC Midtjylland over the 2007‚Äì08 winter break, White was involved in an accidental collision, which resulted in three facial fractures that required surgery. He made a speedy recovery and was back on the field in record time. The start of the 2008‚Äì09 season was marked with highs and lows under Ove Pedersen's management. During the holiday break, AGF decided to move in a new direction with the hiring of Erik Rasmussen as chief trainer. The team has since hovered between 5th & 7th places while getting their new system running smoothly.Yanks Abroad ‚Äì Facial Surgery Shelves US Striker In December 2009, White and AGF mutually agreed to terminate his contract 6 months early. =Al-Ettifaq= In January 2010, White signed with Saudi Arabian club Al-Ettifaq, becoming the second American to play in a Middle Eastern country. =GKS Be≈Çchat√≥w= In the summer 2010, he moved to Polish club GKS Be≈Çchat√≥w on a one-year contract.Jeremiah White w GKS Be≈Çchat√≥w sport.pl =MLS= White was signed by the New England Revolution in March 2012.http://nesoccertoday.com/?p=8694 He was waived on June 27, 2012.http://www.revolutionsoccer.net/news/2012/06/mid- week-update-june-27-2012 National team White made his international debut for the United States on January 19, 2008, in a friendly match against Sweden.

The sandy ridges remained places of safety, where settlements were established. Several valleys ran around the ridges, which rose up to about 12 feet in height. Some of these valleys served as drainage channels. Until the late 18th century, the area on which the present day's road lies remained one such unwanted drainage channel, known then as Atta Pallam. Much of the area was owned by Stephen Popham, a former British MP and later the advocate general in Calcutta, who moved to Madras in 1778. He is credited with establishing a modern police force in the city in 1782. The area where the General Hospital, Madras United Club and the Park Town post office stand today was then a hill known locally as Narimedu (literally 'mound of foxes'), which was named 'Hoggs Hill' by the British. When the British considered it as a security threat to Fort St. George and decided to level the area, Popham negotiated with them to buy the earth removed from the hill to fill the ditch. The thoroughfare thus created came to be known as 'Popham's Broadway'. By the 1890s, the road became known for two food establishments, the first of which was that of P. Venkatachellum, whose condiments and chutneys were popular in England. He is credited with the creation of mulligatawny soup from the local recipe of milagu rasam (milagu thanni). The other restaurant was Harrison's, established in 1891, which today is a contemporary hotel in Nungambakkam. The road was also home to the city's first private hospital run in the 1900s by physician T. A. Sankaranarayanan, decades before the advent of the Apollo Hospitals, the country's first modern corporate hospital, established in 1983. The present-day road A section of the street in 2007 Today, the road has morphed into one of the most important commercial streets of George Town. Several commercial establishments, especially those of opticians, have their shops on this street. The Broadway bus terminus, the largest bus terminus of the Chennai Metropolitan Transport Corporation, is located on the southern end of the road. The road also houses the Mannadi Metro Rail station of the Chennai Metro Rail.

It runs from Highway 30 at the Canadian border south of Gretna, Manitoba to South Dakota Highway 25 north of Claire City. Route description North Dakota Highway 18 starts traveling south at the Canada/United States border south of Gretna, Manitoba. One mile south of the border, the highway crosses the Pembina River and enters Neche. Thirteen miles south of Neche the route begins a concurrency with ND 5. The two routes head west for three miles, then south for one more before entering the city of Cavalier. The ND 5 concurrency ends in Cavalier and ND 18 continues to head south. Thirteen more miles south of Cavalier, ND 18 intersects with ND 66. The highway leaves Pembina County and enters Walsh County four miles south of this intersection.https://maps.google.com/ Just south of the county line is the small city of Hoople, which ND 18 passes just east of. About eight miles south of here, ND 18 forms a short, one-mile concurrency with ND 17, throughout which both highways travel south. The route travels about halfway between the larger cities of Grafton and Park River. Fourteen miles south of the southern end of the ND 17 concurrency, ND 18 enters Grand Forks County. About three miles into Grand Forks County, the route passes east of Inkster. Fourteen miles south of Inkster, ND 18 intersects with US 2, a major east-west route of the northern United States. Two miles south of this intersection, ND 18 reaches the city of Larimore. Twelve miles south of Larimore, the highway begins another concurrency, this one with ND 15. The routes travel east during this concurrency, passing just north of Northwood. After traveling east for eight miles, the concurrency ends and ND 18 travels south for five miles before entering Traill County. ND 18 enters Hatton two miles south of the county line. The highway travels south for eight miles before beginning a concurrency with ND 200. The highway travels south for a mile, east for a mile and a half, southeast for a mile, and east for another mile before entering Portland. The highway travels east for a mile before entering Mayville. In Mayville, the concurrency with ND 200 ends and ND 18 begins traveling south once more. The route heads south for ten miles and then east for five before entering Blanchard. Eight miles south of Blanchard, ND 18 enters Cass County. In Cass County, ND 18 travels south for three miles before entering Hunter. Six miles farther south, the highway heads through Arthur. Fourteen miles south of Arthur, the route turns east and enters Casselton. Turning south again, ND 18 travels for two miles before sharing an interchange with Interstate 94 and US 52. Nine miles south of this interchange, the road heads west for a mile and then south for six miles to enter Leonard. Two miles south of Leonard, ND 18 begins a concurrency with ND 46 along the Cass-Richland county line for five miles. After this concurrency, the highway heads south into Richland County. Thirteen miles south of the county line, ND 18 serves as the eastern terminus of ND 27. Twelve miles south of this intersection, the highway enters Wyndmere. Directly south of Wyndmere, the road has a junction with ND 13. Seven miles south of the ND 13 intersection, ND 18 turns west for a mile, then south for five more before entering Lidgerwood and beginning a concurrency with ND 11. The routes head east and south through Lidgerwood, then east for two miles. The concurrency ends two miles east of Lidgerwood and ND 18 continues to head south. Nine miles south of the end of the ND 11 concurrency, ND 18 reaches the South Dakota border and is continued farther south as South Dakota Highway 25. History North Dakota Highway 18, like many other North Dakota state highways, was put into alignment in 1939. It has remained in its original alignment since then.

The mass media in Malaysia includes television, radio, newspapers, and web-based media such as bloggers. Many media outlets are either owned directly by the government of Malaysia (e.g. Bernama) or owned by component parties of the Barisan Nasional coalition which formed the government until May 2018 (e.g. the Media Prima group, which is owned by the United Malays National Organisation). Opposition parties PAS and PKR, now the main parties of the ruling \\"Pakatan Harapan\\" coalition, publish their own newspapers, Harakah and Suara Keadilan, respectively, which are openly sold alongside regular publications. Since conventional media is so tightly controlled by the government, Malaysia has a lively alternative media scene, characterised by such news portals as Malaysiakini and The Malaysian Insider which take advantage of the government's pledge not to censor the Internet despite its stranglehold on most mass media outlets. Newspapers There are over 30 newspapers and tabloids published mainly in Malay, English, Chinese and Tamil. The most prominent newspapers include The Star, New Straits Times, theSun, Berita Harian, Utusan Malaysia, Sin Chew Jit Poh and Nanyang Siang Pau. Television and radio In 2007, a government agency ordered private television and radio stations to refrain from broadcasting opposition speeches. State-owned RTM operates five free-to-air terrestrial local television channels licensed to broadcast in Malaysia, as well as 33 radio channels nationwide. Meanwhile, Media Prima is the parent company of four television channels and four radio channels (Hot FM, Kool FM, Fly FM & One FM). Privately owned by Astro All Asia networks plc, Astro is Malaysia's current only satellite television provider. There are 200 channels to choose from at a minimum amount of RM 49.95 per month and at a maximum amount of RM 200.00 per month. Astro had 20 radio channels, of which 17 are Astro-branded radio stations, of which nine of them are available via FM radio. HyppTV by Unifi is one of Malaysia's IPTV provider but to take the TV package, the customer must select at least one internet package, from RM 149 per month to RM 350 per month. TV Sarawak (TVS) becomes the first regional TV station from Sarawak in Malaysia to have its own TV station. Albeit not the first in the Sarawak history as back in the April 1998, NTV7 was launched by Sarawakian businessman, Mohd Effendi Norwawi under the entity of Natseven TV Sdn Bhd, before acquired by Media Prima Berhad in 2005. With its own TV station, it will help to counter the problem of state's low priority and under coverage news by Peninsular-based media and increasing the power of East Malaysia representation. Freedom The regulated freedom of the press has been criticised. Although critics concede that journalists \\"probably won't be hauled off and shot\\" for being critical of the government, it has been claimed that the government creates a chilling effect through threats of reduced employment opportunities and refusing journalists' family members \\"a place at one of the better public universities\\". Legislation such as the Printing Presses and Publications Act have also been cited as curtailing freedom of expression.McAdams, Mindy (2007). Why journalists act like chickens. Retrieved 1 April 2007. In 2007, a government agency ‚Äì the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission ‚Äì issued a directive to all private television and radio stations to refrain from broadcasting speeches made by opposition leaders. The move was condemned by politicians from the opposition Democratic Action Party. The directive was later withdrawn by the Energy, Water and Communications Ministry. Malaysia was ranked 141 out of 178 countries in the Press Freedom Index by Reporters Without Borders in 2010 and 122 out of 179 countries in 2012. Because of troop sensitivities, newspapers from Singapore cannot be sold in Malaysia, hence The Straits Times and other Singapore titles are not sold in Malaysia, while the New Straits Times and other Malaysian titles are not sold in Singapore.

British Sugar has opened the UK's first bioethanol plant here. History When the factory was built in 1925, there was no road access to it. It was located on the south bank of the River Wissey, and was also served by the Wissington Light Railway. This railway had been built in 1905, and opened in 1906, for the benefit of local farms. It left the Denver (on the Great Eastern Main Line, the Fen Line) to Stoke Ferry Railway at Abbey Junction, which was located near Station Farm. The line then crossed the river, and continued for some to a terminus at Poppylot. The line was unusual, in that it was not authorised either by an Act of Parliament or by a Light Railway Order. The owners of the factory leased the line, and built another of track, which ensured that sugar beet could reach the plant in sufficient volume to make it efficient.The River Great Ouse and tributaries, (2006), Andrew Hunter Blair, Imray Laurie Norie and Wilson, In addition to the railway transport, three tugs, named Hilgay, Littleport and Wissington, were used to transport goods from the factory to King's Lynn and coal from King's Lynn to the factory in a fleet of 24 steel barges. The Ministry of Agriculture deemed that the factory was of strategic importance during World War II, and took responsibility for it from March 1941. They drafted in Italian prisoners of war to refurbish the railway, and to construct the first roads to the factory. River traffic ceased in 1943. After the war, the Ministry bought the railway in 1947, and ran it themselves. In 1957 they closed the lines to the south of the factory, as most sugar beet was by then delivered to the factory by road. Final closure came in 1982 when improvements to the line (by this point operation was between Denver near Downham Market and Wissington) were required. One of the steam engines is now preserved on the North Norfolk Railway Hudswell Clarke no.1700 'Wissington', another Hudswell Clarke, no.1539 'Derek Crouch' on the Nene Valley Railway and the third one, a Manning Wardle no. 1532 'Newcastle', is preserved at Beamish Museum. Today The plant is now supplied by lorry, collecting product from radius. In 2007, Wissington was the site of the UK's first bioethanol power plant, the excess heat from which was used to heat on-site greenhouses that produced 70 million tomatoes each year; in 2017, the greenhouses switched to producing cannabis plants for medicine production.

Political career McWilliam was a Liberal and served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Postmaster-General from 1963 to 1964 and to the Minister of Public Works from 1964 to 1965. McWilliam served as MP through the middle of a long period of Liberal ascendancy in the Miramichi Valley. The coalition that sustained the Liberal Party was centered on the Irish vote, especially from the town of Chatham where they formed the majority, buttressed by the votes of the Irish minority in Newcastle, and the smaller Irish villages like St. Margarets, Barnaby River and Sevogle. Added to this were the votes of the French-speaking Acadians of Neguac, Rogersville, Beaverbrook and Baie-Sainte-Anne and surrounding areas. The majority of Protestants voted Progressive Conservative, but there were always a minority who supported the Liberals. Although Catholics generally supported the Liberal Party, the Irish Catholic clergy did not generally involve themselves in politics.

Brickman in 1898 and currently owned and run by Gordon and Macphail of Elgin. It is situated near Forres in Morayshire and is fed with spring water from the Chapelton Springs in the Romach Hills beside Forres. History Duncan MacCallum and F.W. Brickmann founded the Benromach Distillery Company in 1898. Duncan MacCallum had previously been working at the Glen Nevis Distillery in Campbeltown and FW Brickmann was a spirit broker in Leith, Edinburgh. Construction work started at the site of Benromach Distillery in 1898 however due to the depression in the Scotch Whisky industry in 1898 the distillery did not start producing whisky until 1900 but closed the same year due to a lack of money. In 1911 Benromach was acquired by the London based Harvey McNair & Co who continued distilling until the onset of the First World War. After the war Benromach was acquired by Benromach Distillery Ltd and was run by this new private company until 1925. In 1938 Benromach was acquired by Associated Scottish Distilleries Ltd which later became a part of Scottish Malt Distillers Ltd. Between 1966 and 1974 the distillery was modernised and continued to run until 1983 when the distillery was officially closed. In 1993 Gordon and MacPhail took over the site and in 1997 they started to restore the distillery to a working order. The design of the distillery was changed slightly to allow it to be operated by one man. Finally in 1998 the distillery was officially reopened by Charles, Prince of Wales and bottling of the new malt started in 2004.Malt Whisky Trail At the World Whisky Awards 2014, Benromach 10 Years Old won gold in the \\"Best Speyside Single Malt ‚Äì 12 Years and Under\\" category.

It is one of the few remaining family-owned, mass-production confectionery companies in the United States. History Giant-sized Smarties candies In 1949, Edward Dee, a second generation candymaker from England, first began producing candy rolls in a rented New Jersey factory in Bloomfield with one wrapping machine and one tablet presser which was a repurposed pellet-making machine. Dee, a Cambridge University graduate, called his product \\"Smarties\\" to \\"encourage people to pursue an education.\\" His family produces a similar candy in England through Swizzels Matlow Co. Initially, Dee took the candy by car to small grocery and tobacco stores. He later moved his American operations to Elizabeth, New Jersey, in 1959 and then again to its current location in Union Township in 1967. Ce De Candy's Canadian operations were first established in Toronto, Ontario, in 1963, and were later moved to Newmarket in 1988. The Canadian candies go by the name Rockets to avoid confusion with Nestle's candy-coated chocolate Smarties. The company now produces Smarties around the clock in its two factories producing over 2.5 billion Smarties candy rolls per year. In 1991, Mr. T and Ce De Candy collaborated to form Crusade for Kids. It encouraged kids to stay in school and say \\"no\\" to drugs. Crusade for Kids raised funds for the Children's Defense Fund charity. In October 2010, the company vice president of sales and marketing was inducted into the Candy Hall of Fame. In 2011, the company changed its name from Ce De Candy, Inc. to Smarties Candy Company after its most famous product. The company launched its \\"Smarties Think\\" campaign in 2013 to promote education and help classrooms in need by donating over $100,000 to provide school supplies. The company completed a 674 kW solar project in 2016, adding 2,100 solar panels to the roof of their New Jersey factory. In October 2017, the company's president of 40 years, Jonathan Dee, stepped down and Liz Dee, Sarah Dee, and Jessica Dee Sawyer assumed the role of co-President. That same month, Smarties announced the #LittleSmarties campaign to promote intellectual curiosity which features historical figures including Jane Goodall, Marie Curie, and Amelia Earhart, as well as a partnership with DonorsChoose to support classrooms in need of funding. Products The company also produces Mega Smarties, Giant Smarties, X-treme Sour Smarties, Tropical Smarties, Love Hearts, Smarties 'n Creme, candy necklaces, Smarties Pops in three sizes, and other candies, including Breath Savers. All Smarties products are peanut-free, gluten-free, dairy-free, and vegan. While generally considered a Halloween staple, groups also give out Smarties to encourage people to buckle up and drive safely. Among these are Tampa Bays' Students Against Destructive Ideas (SADD) and Dum Dum or Smartie initiatives in schools.

It exists in two versions. The painting attempts to portray, both literally and analytically, the totality of the Victorian social system and the transition from a rural to an urban economy. Brown began the painting in 1852 and completed it in 1865, when he set up a special exhibition to show it along with several of his other works. He wrote a detailed catalogue explaining the significance of the picture. The painting was commissioned by Thomas Plint, a well-known collector of Pre-Raphaelite art, who died before its completion.Dianne Sachko Macleod, \\"Plint, Thomas Edward (1823‚Äì1861)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004 A second version, smaller at 684 √ó 990 mm, was commissioned in 1859 and completed in 1863. This is now in the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery. It is closely similar, though for the lady with a blue parasol the face of Maria Leathart, the commissioner's wife, replaces that of Mrs Brown in the Manchester version.Page on the \\"Birmingham Museums & Art Gallery Pre-Raphaelite Online Resource\\", accessed, 14 February 2015 The picture depicts a group of so-called \\"navvies\\" digging up the road to build a tunnel. It is typically assumed that this was part of the extensions of London's sewerage system, which were being undertaken to deal with the threat of typhus and cholera. The workers are in the centre of the painting. On either side of them are individuals who are either unemployed or represent the leisured classes. Behind the workers are two wealthy figures on horseback, whose progress along the road has been halted by the excavations.Biome, Albert, \\"Ford Madox Brown, Carlyle, and Karl Marx: Meaning and Mystification of Work in the Nineteenth Century\\", Arts Magazine, September 1981 The painting also portrays an election campaign, evidenced by posters and people carrying sandwich boards with the name of the candidate \\"Bobus\\". A poster also draws attention to the potential presence of a burglar.Curtis, Gerald, Ford Madox Brown's Work: An Iconographic Analysis, \\"The Art Bulletin\\", Vol. 74, No. 4 (Dec. 1992), pp. 623‚Äì636. The setting is an accurate depiction of The Mount on Heath Street in Hampstead, London, where a side road rises up above the main road and runs alongside it. Brown made a detailed study of the location in 1852. Background and influences Hogarth, Humours of an Election: Chairing the Member. An MP is being carried by his supporters, while a Tory rural labourer and a Whig urban entertainer fight one another.Brown explained that he had intended to demonstrate that the modern British workman could be as fit a subject for art as the more supposedly picturesque Italian lazarone (literally, the \\"mob,\\" used to refer to the street people of Naples). Infoplease definition, originally taken from the Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, E. Cobham Brewer, 1894. He set the painting on Heath Street in Hampstead, of which he made a detailed study. Hampstead was at the time a wealthy area on the outskirts of London, which was undergoing rapid expansion. The development of the new sewerage and drainage systems in the city was also widely discussed in the press as an agent of modernisation. The character of \\"Bobus\\" appears in the writings of Thomas Carlyle as the epitome of a corrupt businessman who uses his money to market himself as a politician. Brown's principal artistic model was the work of William Hogarth, in particular his paintings Humours of an Election and his prints Beer Street and Gin Lane. The Election paintings depicted both the vitality and the corruption of British society, while the prints set up a contrast between poverty and prosperity. While working on the painting Brown founded the Hogarth club to link artists who saw themselves as Hogarth's admirers and followers. William Collins depicting a deferential social system and visual harmony. The boy is tugging his forelock to a passing member of the gentry on horseback (visible as a shadow). The rustic aspects of the composition draw on the established tradition of the picturesque, epitomised by the work of artists such as John Constable and William Collins. The satirical and critical aspects of Hogarth's style work in tandem with Brown's Pre-Raphaelitism, with its intense concentration on the complication of the pictorial surface in conflicting details. This image of potentially violent and jarring confrontation is set in opposition to the social harmony and deference epitomised by the picturesque tradition. Characters and action=Workers= The young navvy (shovelling soil) and the older navvy (sieving quicklime) The principal figure of the young workman is shovelling soil from a platform hanging in a hole onto a large pile behind him. Beneath him in the underground shaft another workman is digging the soil and shovelling it onto the platform. He is only visible in the form of a hand and a shovel appearing from the hole. To his right an older navvy is seen shovelling unsifted lime into a sieve. The fine powder accumulates in a pile on the left.Brown, F. M., Description of Work and other paintings, Nature and Industrialisaton, pp. 316‚Äì20. The flower seller; the fashionable lady, and the evangelist (left to right) The lime is to be used to make mortar which is being mixed by other navvies at the right of the composition. A hodcarrier, visible behind the main navvy, is transporting bricks down into the hole. The sheet floating in front of him is a copy of a religious tract handed to him by the lady in the blue bonnet at the left, who is attempting to evangelise the navvies. She is carrying copies of a tract called The Hodman's Haven or Drink for Thirsty Souls. The reference to \\"drink\\" in the title reflects the emergence of the temperance movement. A navvy on the right, swigging beer, emphasises their rejection of teetotalism. The woman in front of the evangelist represents genteel glamour ‚Äì a fashionable lady whose only \\"job\\" is to look beautiful. The figure beyond her epitomises the opposite end of the social scale, a ragged itinerant who lives in a flophouse in Flower and Dean Street, Whitechapel, the most notoriously criminalised part of London at the time. He is a plant and animal seller, a form of urban worker who obtained flowers, reeds and small animals from the country to sell in the centre of the city. These characters had been described in Henry Mayhew's book London Labour and the London Poor. All these figures are passing by the workers through a narrow pathway which brings them up against the sifted lime powder, a corrosive which symbolises the cleansing assault on their complacent rejection of useful work. The countryman (left) and the beer seller (right) In the centre of the composition is a countryman who has recently moved to the town, identifiable by his rural smock. He is holding a brick-hod and drinking beer supplied by the man in the red waistcoat who is supposed to be a \\"bouncer\\" employed in a local pub. The beer seller's costume includes examples of cheap brummagem jewellery. His persona ‚Äì including a copy of The Times under his arm ‚Äì is a pastiche of a gentleman-flaneur. The two men behind him are imported Irish labourers, recognisable by their costume. This aspect of the painting is directly influenced by Hogarth's Beer Street. The ragamuffin children In the foreground are a group of ragged children who have recently suffered a bereavement, evidenced by the black band on the baby's arm. As Brown says in his description, their ragamuffin status suggests that it was their mother who died. The oldest child, wearing borrowed clothing too old for her, tries to control her wayward brother, who is playing with the navvies' wheelbarrow. The younger girl sucks a carrot in lieu of a dummy and looks into the hole created by the workers. Their mongrel pet dog challenges the fashionable lady's pet dog, because, writes Brown, he hates \\"minions of aristocracy in jackets\\". The baby, who looks challengingly out at the viewer occupies a central position in the composition. Brown's description emphasises this challenge by suddenly moving from a first-person narrative to the second person ‚Äì speaking to his fictional fashionable lady about the perilous situation of the impoverished children. Unemployed labourers resting and sleeping on the embankment On the embankment between the upper and the lower road a group of unemployed rural labourers are sleeping in uneasy postures. A scythe wrapped in protective rope hangs over the railing that separates the productive from the unproductive figures in the composition. The Irish couple by the tree are feeding their baby with gruel, while an older man stands by the tree looking resentful. This aspect of the painting recalls Carlyle's discussion of unemployed Irish migrants in his book Past and Present. Beneath these figures on the road children can be seen playing, while genteel couples and sandwich-board carriers wander through the sun-dappled lower street. At the extreme right a policeman pushes a female orange seller who is resting her basket on a bollard (technically illegal, because she is setting up shop). =Intellectuals= Thomas Carlyle (left) and Frederick Maurice At the right the workers are being watched by two intellectuals who \\"seem to be idle but work\\". They are described as workers in their minds and as \\"the cause of well ordained work in others\\". In fact these are portraits of Thomas Carlyle and Frederick Maurice. Maurice was the founder of Christian socialism. He established worker's educational institutions for which Brown worked. Carlyle was the main inspiration behind the picture. His books Past and Present and Latter-Day Pamphlets had criticised the laissez faire economic system and political corruption. He was known for his so-called \\"gospel of work\\", which described work as a form of worship. He wrote in Past and Present, > It has been written, 'an endless significance lies in Work;' a man perfects > himself by working. Foul jungles are cleared away, fair seedfields rise > instead, and stately cities; and withal the man himself first ceases to be a > jungle and foul unwholesome desert thereby. Consider how, even in the > meanest sorts of Labour, the whole soul of a man is composed into a kind of > real harmony, the instant he sets himself to work! Doubt, Desire, Sorrow, > Remorse, Indignation, Despair itself, all these like helldogs lie > beleaguering the soul of the poor dayworker, as of every man: but he bends > himself with free valour against his task, and all these are stilled, all > these shrink murmuring far off into their caves. The man is now a man. The > blessed glow of Labour in him, is it not as purifying fire, wherein all > poison is burnt up, and of sour smoke itself there is made bright blessed > flame!Past and Present, Chapter XI, Labour. See also, Frederick Engels, > Review of Carlyle's Past and Present, 1844, Engles, Collected Works, > Christopher Upward, trans. In the same book Carlyle creates the character of Bobus Higgins, a corrupt sausage maker who uses horsemeat in his product to undercut competitors. In Latter-Day Pamphlets Bobus is portrayed as a populist manipulator who is going into politics. In the painting his agent appears behind Carlyle's head, prodding local \\"idlers\\" to walk through the streets carrying signs with his name on them. At the left a \\"Vote for Bobus\\" poster has been hit by a ball of mud or faeces and has \\"don't\\" chalked onto it. = Animals/Pets= There are multiple pets, mainly dogs, portrayed in the painting. The lower, central portion contains a tattered mongrel dog hanging around with the young children. This dog represents a pet that the lower class would have, a stray that would be there to keep the owner company. Brown refers to the dog as a \\"rugged democrat\\". Left of that there is a brown dog wearing a sweater, presumably owned, as Brown says, by the woman on the left with the blue parasol. This dog represents the wealthier upper-middle class of the society. The dog is there for companionship but also for play and to show off wealth. Brown says that the democratic dog \\"hates minions of aristocracy in red jackets\\". There is also a bulldog pup asleep near the workmen, implied to be a pet of one of the labourers. Finally on the upper central portion of the painting there is a large hunting dog owned by the most wealthy upper-class man and woman on the horses. This dog is purely bred to help hunt and the only people that are wealthy enough to go hunting, for game or sport. In the far background a dog is seen yapping at horses pulling a carriage, which is about to turn into the main street, hinting at potential disorder to come. Animals are also referred to in the posters on the wall. A wanted poster for a burglar says that he is typically accompanied by a bulldog, and another poster advertises a lecture by \\"Professor Snoox\\" on the habits of cats. Two cats are seen on a roof. In his description Brown says that they \\"are denying his theory in toto\\".Kenneth Bendiner, Art of Ford Madox Brown, Penn State Press, 2010, p. 154. Composition and significance A current day view of The Mount, Heath Street: the location used for Work The painting is structured by the increasing compression of space from right to left, as the rural relaxation on the right side is replaced by the concentrated labour in the middle and the urban crush on the far left. The workers in the centre break up the established relationship between the characters, throwing people together in new ways. Brown reproduces the common triangular structure of the social system, with the horse-riding aristocrats at the top. But they are pushed to the back, stuck and unable to progress ‚Äì forced into the shade in the background, while the workers occupy the brightly lit foreground. The railings around the excavations separate the realm of productive work from that of leisure, lassitude and unproductive work. As with most Pre-Raphaelite paintings the composition minimises chiaroscuro and accumulates motifs in deliberately confusing abundance, containing numerous Hogarthian sub-episodes within the main image (a man washing windows; a dog worrying horses leading a carriage etc.). The composition is also used to dramatically crop figures and motifs which complicates the legibility of space (the hand emerging from the hole; the cropped figures behind the intellectuals' head). Carlyle's smile links the viewer in a paradoxical engagement with the re-working process depicted.Trodd, C, Ford Madox Brown's Work, Harding, E, Reframing the Pre- Raphaelites, Scolar, 1996 ReferencesExternal links * * * Category:Paintings by Ford Madox Brown Category:1865 paintings Category:Collection of Manchester Art Gallery Category:Collections of Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery Category:Dogs in art Category:Horses in art Category:Paintings of children ","title":"Work (painting)"},{"id":"10391781","text":"The Observatory for Protection of Cultural Heritage in Areas of Crisis (OPCHAC) is an Italian-based organization concerned with protecting cultural heritage.

The headquarters of the Pasadena Police Department is located at 207 North Garfield Avenue in Pasadena, just a block from the Pasadena City Hall and Paseo Colorado. The department employs 241 sworn officers, 13 reserve officers, and 126 civilian employees. The police chief is John Perez, who spent his entire career with the department. Overview The Pasadena Police Department was founded in 1886. The department was one of the first police departments to have female police officers. In 2006, Commander Marilyn Diaz left PPD to become the police chief for Sierra Madre, California, becoming Los Angeles County's first female municipal police chief. In 2004, the Pasadena Unified School District dismantled the Pasadena Unified School District Police Department, amidst budget cuts. As a result, the Pasadena Police Department took over police services for the Pasadena Unified School District and PPD's division on PUSD schools is known as the Safe Schools Team, which is made of eight sworn members‚Äîone sergeant and seven officers. Currently the department patrols some notable events, such as the Rose Bowl and the Tournament of Roses Parade, which works jointly with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The department usually steps up patrols by adding officers in areas of recent homicides. This is known as Operation Safe City. The department utilizes primarily the Orange County Sheriff's Academy in Tustin for academy training. PPD also utilizes the Rio Hondo Regional Police Academy in Whittier. Since the establishment of the Pasadena Police Department, three officers have died in the line of duty.The Officer Down Memorial Page =Tasers= PPD has been using Tasers since mid-June 2004. Three years after the deployment of Tasers, 36-year-old Richard Baisner of Arcadia died after being Tasered once by a Pasadena Police Officer. Baisner was Tasered after resisting arrest against PPD officers. After using \\"soft restraints\\" on him while on a gurney, Baisner stopped breathing. An autopsy for the exact cause of death is pending. Air support Pasadena Police Department building, designed by architect Robert A. M. Stern and opened in 1990 The department began air operations in 1969 and was one of the first members of the Airborne Law Enforcement Association. In 1999, the department expanded its operations by creating the Foothill Air Support Team (FAST), working with ten nearby police departments by providing air support to cities that could not afford their own helicopter. Besides Pasadena, cities participating in FAST are Alhambra, Arcadia, Covina, Monrovia, Glendora, San Marino, South Pasadena, Sierra Madre, Pomona, and Irwindale. Three police officers are chosen from the participating FAST cities to work as Tactical Flight Officers, whose duties include observing, monitoring radio frequency for all participating cities, navigating, and coordinating ground units. Pasadena PD also operates and stores a Eurocopter AS350 √âcureuil owned by the Los Angeles Interagency Metropolitan Police Apprehension Crime Task Force (L.A. IMPACT). A pilot and Tactical Flight Officer are assigned full-time to L.A. IMPACT to assist narcotics detectives with high altitude surveillance operations. The department maintains five of their own helicopters, based at an area near Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Rose Bowl. Using a strategy developed by Lieutenant Mike Ingram, Pasadena PD Air Support and the San Gabriel Valley Mosquito and Vector Control District use Pasadena PD helicopters to check swimming pools in 23 cities to ensure cleanliness and to prevent the West Nile virus. On 17 November 2012,The complete NTSB accident report a police helicopter struck another on the ground at the department's heliport, injuring five people. Both aircraft suffered considerable damage.Police helicopter collision occurred when crafts' rotor blades touched, LA Times, 18 November 2012Two Police Helicopters Destroyed In Catastrophic Rotor Collision on YouTube =Fleet= * MD 500 - 1 * Bell 206 BIII - 1 * Bell OH-58 Kiowa Warrior - 3  Controversies and incidents  Over the years, the Pasadena Police Department has been connected to several incidents involving possible excessive force and racial profiling: = Death of Leroy Barnes Jr. = On February 19, 2009, Leroy Barnes Jr, a 38-year-old Black man, was shot and killed by two Pasadena police officers at a traffic stop. Although early official statements issued by the Pasadena police department were conflicting, the shooting occurred inside a car during a struggle over a gun. Police department officials stated that the officers fired at Barnes after pointing a handgun at them. Although the Pasadena Police Officers Association obtained an injunction in court to prevent the initial release of the identities of the two officers involved, the officers were later identified as Glen Reep and Michael Alvarado in papers filed in federal court. = Death of Kendrec McDade = On the evening of March 24, 2012, a 19-year-old Black man named Kendrec McDade was fatally shot by two white Pasadena police officers in northwest Pasadena. The officers, Matthew Griffin and Jeffery Newlen, were responding to a 911 emergency caller who claimed that he had been robbed at gunpoint by two armed men. The 911 caller, Oscar Carrillo-Gonzalez, later admitted to lying about seeing a weapon in order to get a more urgent police response, and served 90 days in jail for the false report. Although McDade was unarmed and not involved in the theft, he was mistaken as a suspect when he was spotted on the same street that the robbery occurred. According to police reports, when the officers began their chase, McDade ran away, and the officers continued their pursuit both on foot and in their patrol car. At some point during the pursuit, McDade turned and ran back towards the patrol car. Griffin, in the driver's seat of the car and believing that McDade was reaching for a gun, shot at McDade four times at close range. Upon hearing the gunshots, Newlen, on foot behind the car, shot at McDade an additional four times. Paramedics were called while McDade, prone and dying on the street, was handcuffed and searched by an officer, who found only a cellphone in McDade's front pocket. McDade was later pronounced dead at a nearby hospital at approximately 12:05 am on March 25, 2012. A medical examiner later determined that seven of the eight bullets fired by Griffin and Newlen hit McDade. In the aftermath of McDade's death, protests and demonstrations occurred and civil rights leaders led community discussions surrounding police use of excessive force and racial profiling. Many called for greater police oversight and the establishment of a police auditor. The officers were not disciplined and returned to active duty after being cleared of criminal wrongdoing by internal review by the Pasadena Police Department and Los Angeles County district attorney's office. McDade's parents filed a civil rights lawsuit against the city of Pasadena for a wrongful death and settled out-of-court for about $1 million. In September of 2014, an independent consulting group completed their investigation of the fatal shooting for the city of Pasadena, but the report was kept secret by a police union representing the two officers involved, citing privacy laws. After a protracted legal battle, the full report was released to the public in November 2015. The report revealed that the independent consulting group found many of the tactical decisions made by the two police officers questionable. = Death of Reginald Thomas Jr. = On September 29, 2016, Reginald Thomas Jr., a 35-year-old Black man, died in police custody after police shocked him with a taser and wrestled with him at an apartment complex. Thomas was the father of eight children. According to Pasadena police and other officials, the police were responding to early-morning calls of a disturbance at the apartment involving a man with a knife and a fire extinguisher. The physical confrontation occurred after Thomas did not obey orders to drop the objects. Six officers were involved in the calls but were not wearing any body cameras. The city of Pasadena settled a lawsuit for wrongful death and paid the family $1.5 million, but the officers did not face trial for allegations of excessive force. = Death of Matthew Jonathan Luis Hurtado = On October 6, 2017, Matthew Johnathan Luis Hurtado, a 28-year-old Latino man, was shot and killed in a park in the city of Duarte by a multi-agency police task force involving officers from the Pasadena Police Department. Hurtado was a suspect wanted for his possible involvement in a shooting in Pasadena which wounded a 19-year-old man and 16-year old girl. The details surrounding his death are uncertain due to conflicting reports. The attorney representing Hurtado's family stated that Hurtado was inside his parked car with a friend enjoying ice cream when \\"police officers approached from all angles,\\" with one police car crashing into his car. Multiple officers then proceeded to open fire on him. An investigation carried out by District Attorney Jackie Lacey's office has a different version of events, in which Hurtado began ramming one of the police vehicles after being asked to put his hands up at gunpoint, after which officers opened fire. Both Hurtado and his friend, a 36-year-old woman, were hit by gunfire and were taken to the hospital, where Hurtado was pronounced dead. Prior to the engagement, the officers involved in the task force were informed of Hurtado's violent criminal history and gang membership. The investigation deemed that the agents and officers involved in the shooting were \\"reasonable in their use of deadly force to prevent the escape of a dangerous, fleeing felon.\\" In a press conference days after the events, Hurtado's family described him as a \\"kind-hearted, well-loved person\\" and father and called the events an execution. = Death of Anthony McClain = On August 15, 2020, a 32-year-old Black man named Anthony McClain was shot and while running away from two Pasadena police officers at a routine traffic stop. Body cam and dashboard video show that McClain was shot in the back, with one wound in the lower right of his back and another to his left shoulder. Paramedics arrived at the scene within five minutes of the incident, but McClain suffered from fatal blood loss from his injuries, dying at Huntington Hospital hours later. The police officers involved claim that McClain had a handgun and that they were worried for their own safety. The officer who shot McClain did not have his body camera turned on. After repeated delays, several protests calling for better police oversight, and legal challenges, the officer who shot McClain was identified as Edwin Dumaguindin by the Pasadena police chief John Perez one month later. A gun was recovered across the street from the location of the traffic stop; the department has not yet released forensic evidence that links McClain to this weapon. = Arrest of Christopher Ballew = On November 9, 2017, a 21-year- old Black man named Christopher Ballew was violently arrested by two Pasadena police officers, Zachary Lujan and Lerry Esparza. Footage from a bystander as well as police body and dashboard camera show the physical altercation occurring at a gas station during a traffic stop. Ballew suffered injuries to his left eye and shin, as well as a broken leg. Footage also shows one officer, Esparza, drawing his firearm and pointing it towards Ballew. Ballew filed a lawsuit against the Pasadena Police Department for damages sustained during the arrest and citing a violation of his civil rights. Data uncovered by Ballew's lawyer, John Burton, suggested that the Pasadena Police Department disproportionately targeted Black and Hispanic motorists during traffic stops over a 2-3 year period. = Arrest of Jasmine Richards = On September 1, 2015, Jasmine \\"Abdullah\\" Richards, a 28-year-old Black woman and founder of Pasadena's Black Lives Matter chapter, was arrested by Pasadena police for attempting to free a person from police custody at a public demonstration. She was sentenced on June 7, 2016 to 90 days in jail and convicted of a felony lynching, a term in California penal code that refers to the illegal act of inciting a mob to remove someone from police custody. The arrest gained national attention because Richards is the first African American to be convicted of a felony lynching. Richards suffered a non-life-threatening injury in a shooting early in the morning of January 17, 2020, in a case being classified as an attempted homicide.

She is known for her portraits and fine art work that often features anthropomorphized animals that have been digitally manipulated with painterly effects. Her photography of animals is regarded for its capability to show a wide range of expressions and feelings that are comparable to that of a seasoned actor or actress. Some of the primates she has captured on film are actually celebrates in their own right, having been featured in different TV shows or movies. She is also highly recognized for her distinct, and stylized photography of celebrities including well known performers such as Gwen Stefani, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Clint Eastwood. She is also known for inserting her own strong opinions into her work. In reference to her work Greenberg states \\"They're portraits and they're personal but there's a little twist going on. An edge.\\"  Biography  Greenberg was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and grew up in a suburb of Detroit, Michigan. Greenberg has been taking photographs since she was 9 years old. In a 1998 New York Times article on female gamers, Greenberg's mother was a computer programmer and her father was a doctor. Greenberg said she has always taken pictures of animals, such as her dog, Plato, when she was young. Greenberg took classes at Cranbrook Academy of Art and the Detroit Institute of Arts. In 1984, she attended the Photography Summer Session held by Parsons School of Design in Paris. In 1985, she won a Traub Memorial Scholarship Travel Fund from Andover High School in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. In 1988, Greenberg completed coursework on \\"Semiotics in Media\\" with Mary Ann Doane at Brown University. In 1989, she graduated with honors from the Rhode Island School of Design with a BFA in Photography.  Photography career  In 1992, Greenberg applied to the Whitney Museum's Independent Study program, but didn't get it that year. She began working for Sassy magazine, doing commercial photography while working on getting her artistic career off the ground. Greenberg has done a large number of celebrity portraits. She specializes in portraiture and uses painterly effects that are drawn using computer technology. Greenberg says that commercial photography influenced and provided inspiration for her portrait work. 2011's Glass Ceiling series involved shooting under water, using scuba gear. She hired professional synchronized swimmers and photographed them in a pool in Culver City. The Glass Ceiling series was featured as a billboard installation in Los Angeles, on the northwest corner of Sunset Boulevard at Fairfax (viewable while driving east). In October 2012, Greenberg published a book of photographs called Horse that features images of horses. Writer A. M. Homes wrote the introduction. Greenberg built photo studios within horse rings to take the photographs. Shooting took place in Los Angeles in an area called Walker's Basin and also in Vancouver at Danny Virtue's ranch, a man who supplies horses to the film industry. In January 2014, Greenberg had an exhibition in Canada of images from \\"Horse.\\" Greenberg said she has had a lifelong love of horses that began at the age of six. Greenberg wanted to explore the connection between how horses have been tamed and feminist theory. She is frequently employed by well known companies including Sony Pictures, Interview, Rolling Stone, Time, GQ and even DreamWorks. Her list of clientele also encompasses big name brands such as Target, Microsoft, and HBO.  Contributions and influence = Artistic style = Greenberg is credited by some within the commercial photography industry as having produced several unique styles that have since been emulated by other photographers. \\"Like LaChapelle and Avedon, Jill has pioneered a new style of photography, and her impact can be seen throughout the entertainment industry\\", the creative director of a Los Angeles creative agency told Brief magazine, with the publication itself characterizing her work as employing \\"distinctive ethereal backlighting.\\" A president of NBC Entertainment Marketing who has employed Greenberg on a number of occasions due to what he terms her \\"distinct and innovative aesthetic\\" observed that \\"many other photographers follow her lead.\\" In 1995, Greenberg branded her first website the moniker \\"The Manipulator\\" after the 80s German photography magazine' Greenberg has acknowledged having made particular use of digital post production, adapting the nickname \\"The Manipulator\\" early in her career due in part to her relatively early adoption of Photoshop, a product she has used since its release in 1990. Nonetheless, she told an interviewer in 2011 that some of what her fans believe to be post production is instead the result of close attention to lighting, merely supplemented with minor \\"flourishes\\" afterwards. = Feminist theory = Greenberg's work and career has focused intermittently on feminist issues, starting with her senior thesis at RISD, \\"The Female Object\\". Her more recent Glass Ceiling series stems from a commercial shoot in which Greenberg was asked to photograph members of the U.S. Olympic Synchronized Swim Team swimming in high heels, an element that heightens sexuality while also hampering ability. According to a press release/bio released ahead of an exhibition and talk, \\"The result is a sadly relevant series of shots depicting women struggling to keep head above water in a context defined by the constraints pressed upon them by others.\\"  Awards  * 1997 Award of Excellence, Communications Arts Annual * 2004 Self- Promo Award ‚Äì 2nd Place, PDN/Nikon Self Promotion * 2005 Special Book ‚Äì 2nd Place, PDN/Nikon Self Promotion * 2006 Award of Excellence, Communications Arts Photography Annual * 2006 Direct Mail Award ‚Äì 1st Place, PDN/Nikon Self Promotion * 2006 Print Placement ‚Äì 2nd Place, PDN/Nikon Self Promotion * 2007 AP23 American Photography * 2007 Society of Publication Designers ‚Äì Silver Medal * 2008 Nominee, New York Photo Awards, Advertising (single) * 2008 Society for Publications Designers - Merit Award, Glamour * 2008 Society for Publications Designers - Merit Award, Women's Health * 2008 Society for Publications Designers - Merit Award, GQ * 2008 Society for Publications Designers - Merit Award, Wired * 2008 Society for Publications Designers - Gold Medal, GQ, \\"Violence of the Lambs\\" * 2009 AP25 American Photography * 2009 PDN PIX Digital Imaging * 2009 Society for Publication Designers * 2010 AP26 American Photography * 2010 PDN PIX Digital Imaging * 2011 SPD Cover of the Day, Chakota Magazine, May 27 * 2011 Key Art Awards Tranist Campaign \\"One Born Every Minute\\" * 2011 American Photographic Artists award winner.

The work featured stylized hyper-real closeups of children's faces contorted by various emotional distresses. The pieces were titled to reflect Greenberg's frustration with both the Bush administration and Christian Fundamentalism in the United States. The children were either professionally hired or were the children of friends (and included her daughter). All were accompanied by their parents, who assisted in getting the children to cry. The series resulted in active, often heated online discussion and news coverage, and resulted in hate mail which continued for several years. The images, meanwhile, have been imitated and used without permission for unrelated campaigns. = John McCain = In August 2008, The Atlantic asked her to photograph John McCain for the magazine's October 2008 cover. Greenberg said they didn't have enough money to pay her so she gave them license to use one of her photos for the cover (while she retained ownership of the photo) for free, for one time use. Greenberg decided to make some personal images of the pictures. \\"I really didn't want there to be another Republican in the White House, so I decided to put my McCain pictures out on voting day.\\" Saying she saw the work as political cartoons. \\"I thought it was the Artist Jill Greenberg appropriating the work of the Commercial Photographer Jill Greenberg.\\" Once the magazine hit the newsstands, Greenberg discussed in an article in a photo industry magazine that she had shot additional images, using lighting to depict McCain in stark shadow, so that she could create her own political art. Greenberg also posted to her website versions of photographs that she had created artwork from. On the cover of the magazine the presidential candidate is featured appearing to be tired, battle- worn and focused but on her website, McCain is shown in the way Greenberg views him. In one of the photos, the senator is shown with bright pink lipstick clumsily applied across his lips, beneath the statement \\"It was really fun to cheat on my car-injury-disabled first wife.\\" Another shot from the photo shoot displayed on her website shows McCain in dramatic lighting with his mouth severely altered. His teeth are replaced with sharp, predatorily, pointy teeth and blood is dripping out of his mouth.  Personal life  Greenberg was based in New York for about 12 years. She moved to Los Angeles in 2000 where she met her husband Robert \\"Rob\\" Green. Greenberg moved back to New York City in 2013 with her family for her husband's position as SVP, Creative-Digital at Cond√© Nast Entertainment. Greenberg and Green have two children, daughter Violet and son Zed.  Works or publications = Books = * Greenberg, Jill. Monkey Portraits. New York: Bulfinch Press, 2006. * Greenberg, Jill.

It is combined with a visual field test such as standard automated perimetry (SAP) or short wavelength automated perimetry (SWAP) to determine visual fields in a more efficient manner. Standard automated perimetry determines how dim of light (the threshold) can be seen at various points in an individual eye's visual field. Various algorithms have been developed to determine this threshold in the dozens to over a hundred individual points in a single visual field. The SITA algorithm optimizes the determination of perimetry thresholds by continuously estimating what the expected threshold is based on the patient's age and neighboring thresholds. In this manner, it can reduce the time necessary to acquire a visual field by up to 50%, and it decreases patient fatigue and increases reliability. SITA mode is now widely used in many computerized automated perimeters. The testing mode interrupts testing when measurement error is reached. This results in a shorter test time with reportedly equal accuracy as other automated threshold visual fields.

The line connected to the Bergen Line in Voss, and ran to the Hardangerfjord and the district of Hardanger. Construction started in 1921, but the line did not open until 1 April 1935. Owned and operated by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB), the passenger transport was provided by three NSB Class 64 electric multiple units. They remained in use until 1985, when passenger transport was terminated. All transport ceased in 1988, and of the line was demolished in 1991. The from Voss to Palmafoss remains, and is owned by the Norwegian National Rail Administration. The line featured six stations, fourteen halts, four tunnels and was among Norway's steepest railways. It was NSB's first line to open electrified. The line was known as the Granvin Line () until February 1936. In 2016 Palmafoss established an emergency freight terminal and the tracks were reestablished. Route The Hardanger Line near Skjervet in 1933 The Hardanger Line ran from Voss to Granvin in Hardanger.Aspenberg (1994): 250 From Voss to Skjervet, the line ran in relatively flat terrain, with easy construction.Aspenberg (1994): 251 Along this section the route followed what is now Norwegian National Road 13. At Skjervet, the two split;Hordaland County Municipality (1981):59 towards Nesheim the gradient increased and the topography became more difficult. On this section there were four tunnels, named Skjervet Tunnel I through IV, the longest being .Bjerke (1994): 146 Between the two longest tunnels, the line was built on a shelf. Later, the tunnel was extended from to also include that portion in the tunnel.Aspenberg (1994): 254 From Skjervet, the railway ran on the west side of the river Granvinvatnet, while the road ran on the east side. The Hardanger Line was built with a minimum curve radius of , a maximum gradient of 4.5 percent and built with standard gauge tracks weighing , later increased to . In 1980, the section from Voss to Palmafoss had a permitted axle load of and a maximum speed of . From Palmafoss to Granvin, the permitted axle load was and the maximum speed was .Hordaland County Municipality (1981): 22 The system had stations with buildings at Voss, Palmafoss, M√∏nshaug, Skjervet, Nesheim and Granvin. In addition, there were halts at Haugamo, Kinne, Bj√∏rgum, Mala, Dalsleitet, Flatlandsmo, S√•kvitno, Selland and Kolanes. Granvin is a port on the Hardangerfjord and was the center for freight transport in Hardanger. Hardanger is dominated by a small number of large industrial companies, primarily smelters, which were responsible for more than 80 percent of the line's cargo volume.Hordaland County Municipality (1981): 4 While Hardanger in the 1980s had a population of 40,000, Granvin had a population of 1,000 and was the smallest municipality in Hardanger.Hordaland County Municipality (1981): 11 Granvin served as a ferry hub for services by Hardanger Sunnhordlandske Dampskipsselskap (HSD), and in 1980 there up to two daily services with the local ferry services in Hardanger, in addition to fast ferries to both Bergen and Stavanger.Hordaland County Municipality (1981): 15 Buses operated to Granvin from Norheimsund and Kvanndal.Hordaland County Municipality (1981): 62 The line and power system is intact for from Voss to Palmafoss and is retained by the Norwegian National Rail Administration.Aspenberg (1994): 257 From there to Skjervet, the line has been asphalted, and is used as a hiking and bicycle path. The section from Skjervet to Nesheim is disused, although it has been proposed used as a road. From Nesheim the hiking and bicycle path continues, although the last kilometer before Granvin the right-of-way is disused. The station buildings at Nesheim and Granvin remain, but the ones at Palmafoss, M√∏nshaug and Skjervet has been demolished. In 2016 Palmafoss established an emergency freight terminal for the Bergen line. If the Bergen Line is closed, freight can be transferred to trucks at Palmafoss. At the same time the tracks were renovated and reestablished between Voss and Palmafoss.http://www.jernbaneverket.no/Nyheter/Nyhetsarkiv/2016/bygger- beredskapsterminaler-for-godstrafikken/ History During construction of the Voss Line from Bergen to Voss, there was a proposal to extend the line from Voss to Granvin on the Hardangerfjord. The plans were again taken up to consideration with the construction of the Bergen Line, but also this time the plans were scrapped. Some people wanted the line to be a tramway and when it was passed by the Parliament of Norway on 12 July 1919; the plans incorporated some elements of a tramway, giving the line a lower standard than the mainline. The railway was to be built electrified, and construction started in 1921. However, there was a lack of engineers, forcing a slow pace. On 5 November 1923, parliament passed the final plans for the railway, and the pace of construction was accelerated. Construction during 1927 In 1927, Minister of Labour Worm Hirsch Darre-Jenssen of the Conservative Party stopped the work on the railway, stating that time had run out and that there instead should be built a road. By then, had been invested and parliament decided that construction should continue. However, Darre-Jenssen convinced Hordaland County Council to make a statement against the Hardanger Line, the Fl√•m Line and the Namsos Line, without this stopping construction. In 1931, parliament reconsidered the electrification of the line, and there was consensus for electrification. The Hardanger Line opened on 1 April 1935 and became NSB's first line to be electrified at the time of opening.Aspenberg (2001): 28 In February 1936, the line changed name from the Granvin Line to the Hardanger Line.Bjerke (1994): 19 Three Class 64 electric multiple units (EMU) were delivered from Str√∏mmens V√¶rksted in 1934. Only long, they were the smallest EMUs ever operated by NSB. In addition, four passenger cars were delivered, with each multiple unit able to haul two passenger cars. Occasionally, Class 64 trains were used on the Fl√•m Line, after it was electrified in 1944, and El 9-hauled trains from the Fl√•m Line used on the Hardanger Line.Aspenberg (1994): 253 In the first year of operation, the line had 60,850 passengers, significantly over expectations.Aspenberg (1994): 253‚Äì254 After the opening, there were five daily round trips. In 1939, the extension of the longest tunnel started, because the nearby section was subject to landslides. It was completed by the German occupational forces during World War II, but not taken into use by the railway until 1945 because of the German military's use of the tunnel as an ammunition depot. Because of the electric traction, the line was not affected by the lack of coal during World War II, and in 1945 it had 285,900 passengers. After the end of the war, the number of daily round trips increased to seven, but this was reduced to six in the 1950s. In 1955, a morning and evening coach service started between Granvin and Voss. It was further extended in 1968, when it started corresponding with services on the Bergen Line.Hordaland County Municipality (1981): 56 Initially, the freight transport was small. During the war, transport increased many-fold, particularly because of export of lumber.Hordaland County Municipality (1981): 17 In 1966, a spur was built just south of Palmafoss to Voss Cementvarefabrikk. By the end of the 1960s, the line was transporting . During the late 1970s, the amount of transport fel dramatically, and reached in 1980. Nearly half of this was import of lumber to three sawmills and manufacturing companies.Hordaland County Municipality (1981): 20 In 1972, Linjegods established a daily scheduled truck service to Granvin. Although Linjegods used train to and from Voss, the service from Voss to Granvin was operated parallel to the railway. In 1975, Tollpost Globe also established a similar service between Voss and Granvin. During the late 1970s, the manufacturer Bj√∏lvefossen experienced a large drop in the demand of ferroalloys, reducing production‚Äîand thus transport on the line‚Äîby .Hordaland County Municipality (1981): 18 Another issue for the line was that it has a permitted axle load of only ; this either prohibited optimal wagon weights on the main lines, or causing transshipment at Voss, both causing increased costs. In 1977, the average distance for cargo shipped from the Hardanger Line was by rail.Hordaland County Municipality (1981): 21 During construction along the lake Granvinvatnet in 1927 In 1980, the line had NOK 2.1 million in income, of which NOK 1.6 million was from freight (representing all revenue from freight that ran on the Hardanger Line). Operating expenses were NOK 4.8 million, and the deficit was covered by the national government.Hordaland County Municipality (1981): 23 The line employed 21 people.Hordaland County Municipality (1981): 60 In 1980, the estimated cost of upgrading the line to axle load was NOK 9.6 million.Hordaland County Municipality (1981): 28 Freight volume was then estimated to increase between 100 and 300 percent, and an upgrade was calculated to give a positive net present value, although it would not be sufficient to cover the full existing deficit.Hordaland County Municipality (1981): 30 The plans included introduction of a refrigerated depot at Granvin.Hordaland County Municipality (1981): 31 At the same time, it was estimated that the cost of retaining a axle load would require investments of NOK 6 million.Hordaland County Municipality (1981): 33 In 1979, the concession for passenger transport between Voss and Granvin was transferred from NSB's bus division to HSD and Bergen‚ÄìHardanger‚ÄìVoss Billag. At the same time, the number of weekly services increased from 14 to 34. This was largely a result of the 1975 declaration by Hordaland County Council to support the closure of the line.Hordaland County Municipality (1981): 59 In 1980, the railway had 60,000 passengers.Hordaland County Municipality (1981): 57 A halt was opened at Mala in 1981, but then all passenger traffic was terminated on 2 June 1985. Class 64 had remained in use until the end, and there existed no political desire to invest in new rolling stock. Freight transport was retained, at first using El 9, and later shunting locomotives because of the lack of maintenance. From 1 March 1989, all transport on the line was terminated. NSB wanted to renovate the line and continue operations. Among the plans were to transport metal from the smelters in Hardanger via the Hardanger Line to Continental Europe. This would have required the axle load to be increased. Other plans were to extend some of the departures of the Bergen Commuter Rail from Voss to Granvin or operate commercially profitable tourist trains similar to the service provided on the Fl√•m Line.Aspenberg (1994): 255 Remains of the Hardanger Line today. The municipalities of Voss and Granvin wanted to use the right-of-way for a hiking and bicycle path, and NSB canceled their plans. Demolition started on 10 December 1991, although the section from Voss to Palmafoss was kept to serve a cement factory. Two of the Class 64 trains have been preserved by the Norwegian Railway Association and are based at the Old Voss Line in Bergen.Aspenberg (1994): 256 ReferencesSources  External links *Jernbane.net pictures from Hardangerbanen Category:Railway lines in Norway Category:Railway lines in Vestland Category:Railway lines opened in 1935 Category:Railway lines closed in 1988 Category:1935 establishments in Norway Category:Voss ","title":"Hardanger Line"},{"id":"10391880","text":"Spectator Magazine was an American weekly newspaper published and distributed in San Francisco from 1978 until October 2005, and dubbed itself \\"California's original adult newsmagazine\\".Spectator.net, from the Internet Archive The magazine in tabloid format featured sex and BDSM related stories and advice as well as numerous advertisements for phone sex, strip clubs and other sex businesses.

This was done with careful consideration and with the agreement that the new owners would have money to invest in the Spectator and to face the malicious charges brought up by Yank. Unfortunately, the new Editor in Chief Terry Hall was not up for the challenge and, under false pretenses, took over the Spectator with no intention to invest in a long-term business plan, and ignoring the pressing legal issues that had befallen the magazine. Terry Hall also refused to pay his employees and gutted The Spectator before filing for bankruptcy and closing it down that same year in 2005. Dave Patrick was the principal photographer and managing editor for the paper from creation to the end.  See also  * Sebago, Inc. v.

Bennett (born June 12, 1931) is the founder and former president and CEO of the Divers Alert Network (DAN), a non-profit organization devoted to assisting scuba divers in need. He is a professor of anesthesiology at Duke University Medical Center, and is currently the Senior Director of the Center for Hyperbaric Medicine and Environmental Physiology at Duke. Bennett is recognized as a leading authority on the effects of high pressure on human physiology. Bennett was born in Portsmouth, Hampshire, England. He was employed at the Royal Navy Physiology Laboratory near Portsmouth for 20 years, beginning in 1953. During this time, he formed and headed the Defence and Civil Institute for Environmental Medicine in Canada.Platinum Pro 5000 Diver Profile:Peter B. Bennett Education * University of London, 1951, B.Sc. * University of Southampton, 1964, Ph.D. * University of Southampton, 1984, D.Sc. Research As a researcher, Bennett has performed studies of nitrogen narcosis, oxygen toxicity, submarine escape, decompression illness, ascent rates, and the effects of flying after diving. Bennett first described and coined the name of high pressure nervous syndrome (HPNS), a diving disorder resulting from too much time breathing a high-pressure mixture of helium and oxygen known as heliox. Bennett was a consultant on the James Cameron underwater science fiction film The Abyss, in which a character experiences HPNS. Bennett is credited with the invention of trimix breathing gas. In 1981, at Duke University Medical Center, he conducted an experiment called Atlantis III lasting 43 days, which involved compressing divers to an equivalent depth of , and slowly decompressing them to surface pressure, setting a world record in the process. In 45 years, Bennett has published over 200 scientific papers and six books. Retirement Dr. Bennett received the 2002 Diving Equipment and Marketing Association (DEMA) Reaching Out Award for his contribution to the diving industry, and the Ernst and Young Entrepreneur of the Year 2002 award for contributions to business in the life sciences. He stepped down as President of the Divers Alert Network of America on 30 June 2003, after 23 years at the helm. Bennett was pressured by board members to step down, in reaction to alleged improprieties in his handling of the organization's finances. From 2004 to 2007, Bennett served as Executive Director of the International Divers Alert Network. As of 2007, Bennett has been serving as the executive director of the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society.

Set in late-1950s South Africa, it focuses on teenager Kat Diamond, who believes he's the best singer and dancer in District Six, a multi-racial slum in Cape Town. With his friends Ballie, Magoo, Bingo, and Lucy, he forms the a cappella group the Cavalla Kings, and the quintet - emulating the American doo wop and rock and roll they adore - becomes a sensation, graduating from street corners to \\"whites only\\" nightclubs (where the dictates of apartheid force them to use the rear entrance) and a recording contract. The show was inspired by the memories of Salie Daniels, the real- life Kat who appeared as the narrator in the original production. After touring South Africa, the show was invited to the Tricycle Theatre in Kilburn in November 1997, and returned to that venue prior to its opening in the West End. Directed by Kramer and choreographed by Loukmaan Adams and Jody Abrahams, it opened on March 23, 1998 at the Vaudeville Theatre, where it ran for slightly more than four months. In addition to Daniels, the cast included Abrahams as the young Kat, Adams as Bingo, Junaid Booysen as Ballie, Alistair Izobel as Magoo, and Mandisa Bardill as Lucy. Kat and the Kings won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Musical and, in an unusual move, the entire cast was named Best Actor in a Musical. The show also was nominated for Best Theatre Choreography. An original cast album was recorded live during the June 6, 1998 performance and released by First Night Records. After fifteen previews, the Broadway production opened on August 19, 1999 at the Cort Theatre, where it ran for 157 performances. Terry Hector and Kim Louis replaced Daniels as the elder Kat and Mandisa Bardill as Lucy, respectively, but the remainder of the cast and the director and choreographers were from the London production. It was nominated for Drama Desk Awards for Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical (Alistair Izobell), Outstanding Choreography, and Outstanding Orchestrations.

Two times he served as chief of state of El Salvador (1829‚Äì30 and 1830‚Äì32). Early life Cornejo was born in 1788 to Jos√© Mar√≠a Cornejo and Jacoba Merino. He married Nicolasa de Lezama. In Guatemala he studied philosophy, obtaining a diploma on January 14, 1809. Later he studied canon law, but without graduating, and after that civil law, which he also did not finish. He was in Guatemala when the United Provinces of Central America approved inclusion into the First Mexican Empire of Agust√≠n de Iturbide. Because Cornejo opposed this union, he was sent to prison. He was freed in June 1822, and returned to El Salvador. Career He was a deputy to the state congress in 1826, 1827 and 1828, when El Salvador was part of the Federal Republic of Central America. Attaining considerable fame, he also became mayor of San Vicente and permanent councilman. When elections for chief of state were convoked among the towns, Cornejo was the winner. He took possession of the government (still a state within the federation) on January 30, 1829 and governed for a little more than a year, to February 16, 1830. He served a second term from December 4, 1830 to April 3, 1832. Federal President Francisco Moraz√°n transferred the capital of the Federation from Guatemala City to San Salvador in December 1831, but because of opposition from Cornejo (who opposed the federation), Moraz√°n was forced to leave San Salvador on January 6, 1832. He went to Honduras, where he awaited the arrival of more troops from Nicaragua to reenter El Salvador. Together with Manuel Jos√© Arce Cornejo proclaimed the separation of El Salvador from the Union in 1832. On March 17 of that year the Salvadoran town of Chalatenango pronounced against Cornejo and in favor of the federal government. The town of Metap√°n did likewise.El Peri√≥dico Nuevo Enfoque, March 2007 Moraz√°n attacked San Miguel, El Salvador on February 28, 1832. On March 14, 1832 in the Battle of Jocoro, he defeated Cornejo. On March 28 he defeated him again at San Salvador. Cornejo was taken prisoner and Moraz√°n took over direct control of El Salvador.

Strict ideological conformity in the humanities and social sciences was demanded. Competence and aesthetics were to be replaced by ideology; professionals were to be replaced by agitators; and culture was once again to become an instrument for communist propaganda.Boz√≥ki, p. 57. In their final version of early November 1971, publicized as an official document of the PCR Plenum, the Theses carried the title: Expunere cu privire la programul PCR pentru √ÆmbunƒÉtƒÉ»õirea activitƒÉ»õii ideologice, ridicarea nivelului general al cunoa»ôterii »ôi educa»õia socialistƒÉ a maselor, pentru a»ôezarea rela»õiilor din societatea noastrƒÉ pe baza principiilor eticii »ôi echitƒÉ»õii socialiste »ôi comuniste (\\"Exposition regarding the PCR programme for improving ideological activity, raising the general level of knowledge and the socialist education of the masses, in order to arrange relations in our society on the basis of the principles of socialist and communist ethics and equity\\"). Background After a period of rigid Stalinism from 1948, Romanian cultural life experienced a modest trend of liberalization and ideological relaxation in the early 1960s.Keith Hitchins, \\"Historiography of the Countries of Central Europe: Romania\\", The American Historical Review, Vol. 97, No. 4. (Oct. 1992), p. 1081.TismƒÉneanu, pp. 223‚Äì42. This trend accelerated with the IXth Congress of the Romanian Communist Party in 1965. \\"Memoria comunismului. Fondul ISISP din Biblioteca CentralƒÉ UniversitarƒÉ din Bucure»ôti\\" (\\"The Memory of Communism. The ISIP Fund at the Central University Library in Bucharest\\") . A talented oppositional generation of writers emerged: Nichita StƒÉnescu, Ana Blandiana, Gabriel Liiceanu, Nicolae Manolescu, Adrian PƒÉunescu, and others.Boz√≥ki, p. 56 Furthermore, at the April 1968 Central Committee plenum, Ceau»ôescu denounced his predecessor Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej and rehabilitated Lucre»õiu PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu, executed just two days before Ceau»ôescu joined the Politburo (thus allowing him to claim innocence and to demote a key rival, Alexandru DrƒÉghici).Cioroianu, pp. 397‚Äì9.Deletant, p. 182.TismƒÉneanu, pp. 157‚Äì8. This opened up even more space for artistic expression. Eugen Barbu's novel Principele (\\"The Prince\\", 1969), though set in the Phanariot era, clearly refers to Gheorghiu-Dej ‚Äî there is even a project to build a canal that claims many of its builders' lives (a disguised reference to the Danube-Black Sea Canal). In Dumitru Radu Popescu's novel F, abuses committed during collectivization are explored. Augustin Buzura's novel Absen»õii (\\"The Absent Ones\\", 1970) went so far as to provide a critique of contemporary society, describing the spiritual crisis of a young doctor. To be sure, censorship remained in place. Alexandru Ivasiuc and Paul Goma had both been imprisoned for their participation in the Bucharest student movement of 1956, and each wrote a novel about a man's prison experiences and efforts to readjust after his release. Goma's Ostinato describes prison life, Securitate methods and the excesses of collectivisation. The censor asked for changes; eventually Goma published the book uncut in West Germany in the fall of 1971. Ivasiuc, in his PƒÉsƒÉrile (\\"The Birds\\"), complied with the censor's demands by justifying the protagonist's arrest and portraying the secret police in a positive light. Nevertheless, most writers were optimistic that the Party would tolerate a broader range of themes in creative literature.Deletant, pp. 182‚Äì3. A thaw in relations with the United States, chief adversary of the Soviet bloc during the Cold War, also took place and brought with it an impact on citizens' lives. A Pepsi-Cola factory opened in Constan»õa in 1967, its product promoted in the press through American-style advertisements. The slogan \\"Pepsi, drive and energy\\" ran regularly in newspapers that just a few years earlier made no mention of Western products. Coca-Cola was not produced domestically, but could be found in bars and \\"Comturist shops\\", stores with a restricted clientele where Western goods could be purchased in hard currency. In 1968, the first student bar/club opened in Bucharest; a writer for Via»õa Studen»õeascƒÉ described \\"low tables, discreet light... chewing gum and cigarettes, Pepsi and Coca-Cola, mechanical games, billiards... plus a few hours of interesting discussions. Here is why the club bar appears as an answer to a natural need for communication, for exchanging ideas and clashing opinions... in a relaxed atmosphere\\".Barbu, p. 169. Modern American art, harshly criticised during the period of socialist realism, began to receive favourable coverage, as seen during an exhibition (\\"American painting since 1945\\") that opened in early 1969, featuring work by artists such as Jackson Pollock, Robert Rauschenberg and James Rosenquist.Barbu, pp. 169-70. Even the US government received praise: President Richard Nixon's world tour of 1969 was closely followed,Barbu, p. 170. and the moon landing that July featured in advertisements, was broadcast live (in Socialist Europe, only Yugoslavia did so as well), and occasioned warm greetings from Ceau»ôescu to Nixon and the American people.Barbu, p. 171. Probably the high point of Romanian-American relations during the Communist period came early the following month, when tens of thousands of enthusiastic Bucharesters welcomed Nixon, who became the first US President to visit an Eastern Bloc country.Barbu, p. 172. Writing over three decades later, Sorin Preda, who arrived in Bucharest from BacƒÉu as an 18-year-old in 1970, recalled the cultural scene: The Theses Ceau»ôescu meets Kim on June 15, 1971 Ceau»ôescu visited the People's Republic of China, North Korea, North Vietnam and Mongolia in 1971.Cioroianu, p. 489.TismƒÉneanu, p. 2412.Minutes of the Romanian Politburo Meeting Concerning Nicolae Ceau»ôescu's Visit to China, North Korea, Mongolia, and Vietnam , Parallel History Project on Cooperative Security He took great interest in the idea of total national transformation as embodied in the programs of the Workers' Party of Korea and China's Cultural Revolution. He was also inspired by the personality cults of China's Mao Zedong and North Korea's Kim Il-sung. Shortly after returning home, he began to emulate North Korea's system, influenced by Kim Il-sung's Juche philosophy. Upon his return, he issued the Theses, which contained seventeen proposals. Among these were: continuous growth in the \\"leading role\\" of the Party; improvement of Party education and of mass political action; youth participation on large construction projects as part of their \\"patriotic work\\" (muncƒÉ patrioticƒÉ); an intensification of political- ideological education in schools and universities, as well as in children's, youth and student organisations (like the Union of Communist Youth and its affiliates); and an expansion of political propaganda, orienting radio and television shows to this end, as well as publishing houses, theatres and cinemas, opera, ballet, artists' unions, etc., promoting a \\"militant, revolutionary\\" character in artistic productions. The liberalisation of 1965 was condemned, and an Index of banned books and authors was re-established. Although presented in terms of \\"Socialist Humanism\\", the Theses in fact marked a return to socialist realism, reaffirming an ideological basis for literature that, in theory, the Party had hardly abandoned. The difference was the addition of Party-sponsored nationalism in historiography; quoting Nicolae Iorga in another speech in July 1971, Ceau»ôescu asserted that \\"the man who does not write for his entire people is not a poet\\",Deletant, p. 184. and presented himself as the defender of Romanian values (an intensification of the personality cult).Roper, Steven D., Romania: The Unfinished Revolution, p. 51, Routledge, 2000, . Impact Especially after the Writers' Congress of 1968, Party leaders started to clash with writers; earlier that year Ceau»ôescu had announced: \\"the freedom of the individual is not in contradiction with the general demands and interests of society but, on the contrary, serves these interests\\".Ceau»ôescu, in Verdery, p. 113. Ceau»ôescu managed to co-opt numerous intellectuals (many of them formerly apolitical or even oppositionist) and bring them into the Party after condemning the Warsaw Pact's invasion of Czechoslovakia,Verdery, p. 185. but still the Party began to intensify the struggle among writers as a group and between them and the Party. In 1970, awards of literary prizes brought the Party leadership into open conflict with the Writers' Union. This determined the Party to recover the privilege of granting such awards and of determining their standards of value.Verdery, p. 113. Despite these forebodings of conflict, the Theses, with their promise of Neo-Stalinism, came as a shock. The Party was supposed to supervise the Theses' implementation closely and meticulously, but it was unable to do so with the same efficacy as in the 1950s. In part, this was due to the artistic community, which was numbed by the proposals and roused into a temporary united front against them. Zaharia Stancu and Eugen Jebeleanu, long associated with the r√©gime, joined in protest with younger writers like Buzura, PƒÉunescu, Popescu and Marin Sorescu. Leonid Dimov and Dumitru »öepeneag denounced the proposals on Radio Free Europe in Paris, and Nicolae Breban, editor-in-chief of Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, resigned while in West Germany and attacked the Theses in an interview with Le Monde. Writers appeared combative at a meeting with Ceau»ôescu in Neptun.Boz√≥ki, p. 58.Deletant, p. 185. The Party issued its own counter-measures. For instance, a law passed in December 1971 prohibited the broadcasting or publication abroad of any written material that might prejudice the interest of the state. Romanian citizens were also forbidden from having any contact with foreign radio stations or newspapers, as this was considered hostile to Romania. One man who had submitted a volume of poetry to a critic for evaluation was tried for having written \\"hostile\\" verse; despite the critic having come to defend him, a military court sentenced him to 12 years' imprisonment.Boz√≥ki, p. 59. However, in advance of the National Writers' Conference (May 1972), the writers' initial solidarity was destroyed by infighting, not by the Party (which temporarily withdrew into the background). After »òtefan BƒÉnulescu resigned as editor of LuceafƒÉrul, PƒÉunescu fought with FƒÉnu»ô Neagu for the position, which went to someone else, causing Neagu to leave the opposition. Initial supporters of the Theses included Eugen Barbu, Aurel Baranga and Mihnea Gheorghiu; Nichita StƒÉnescu also claimed to have received them with \\"a particular joy\\" and to regard them as \\"a real aid to culture\\".Deletant, pp. 185‚Äì6. Writers felt resentment at Goma's success in West Germany and at »öepeneag's having been translated into French; the Party exploited this by persuading the Writers' Union to hold its 1972 congress with delegates elected by secret ballot, not by a general assembly ‚Äî delegates would choose one of two names offered to them. By the time of the July 1972 National Party Conference, the cultural √©lite's strategies and the conflicts that would dominate the 1970s and 1980s had crystallized. Dissident Monica Lovinescu describes four features of the literary scene in Romania until 1989: intermittent courage; position in the social order transformed into an aesthetic criterion; the efficacy of some means of corruption; and a breakdown between generations, with many young oppositionists ready to compromise and some older writers ready to resist.Lovinescu, in Boz√≥ki, p. 60 The Party offered increased royalties and pensions and played upon writers' envy, which led to the exclusion of Goma and »öepeneag, who failed to be elected by secret ballot and were jeered when they spoke at the Union delegate election meeting before the conference; there, it was also established that Goma had no talent. While writers like Blandiana, Buzura, »òtefan Augustin Doina»ô and Marin Sorescu refused to conform, maintaining moral and artistic integrity, Goma and »öepeneag were targeted for their readiness to challenge the Party's cultural dictates. Other writers were anxious not to jeopardise their privileges and afraid that the Party might use the Theses to bring new \\"writers\\" into a rebellious Union. They instead preferred subtle evasion of their constraints and so were reluctant to back the pair of more outspoken dissidents.Deletant, p. 186. Within three years, the balance of power in the writers' community had shifted from the 1960s generation to the protochronists; writers eager for greater influence could now obtain it by specialising in the production of ideology.Verdery, p. 186. These included both figures on the decline who hoped to revive their careers, such as Barbu (whose career had suffered at the expense of oppositionists),Verdery, p. 185. and younger writers like PƒÉunescu, an initial opponent. The two factions remained in open conflict for a decade, but by 1981 the Party had rendered the Union impotent by freezing its funds and restricting its activities ‚Äî no more Writers' Conferences were allowed after that year.Verdery, p. 187. Instead, with the greater emphasis on ideology, force, and centralisation, and with more funds, the protochronists remained more influential until the Romanian Revolution of December 1989, having been reinforced by the \\"Mangalia Theses\\" in the summer of 1982.Liiceanu, p. xviii Particularly in the 1980s, Romanian culture and science became increasingly isolated internationally.Istoria Rom√¢niei √Æn date, p. 621, Editura EnciclopedicƒÉ, Bucharest, 2003, . Also as a result of the Theses, sociology was removed as a university discipline and what was left was taught at the Party's »òtefan Gheorghiu Academy. The number of those allowed to study non-technical subjects at the university was sharply cut; fewer books were published; and the privileges formerly accorded to intellectuals were reduced. In 1974, the Academy of Sciences was forced to take on Elena Ceau»ôescu as a member and then its head; she politicized it to such an extent that its prestige and much of its serious research were destroyed.Chirot, Daniel, Modern Tyrants: the power and prevalence of evil in our age, p. 246, Princeton University Press, 1996, .

It is the American subsidiary of French-based Poma, which is owned by the Italian company HTI Group. The North American company was formed in 2000 when the Seeber Group, owner of Leitner, bought Poma and merged both companies' North American subsidiaries. Leitner-Poma of America operates a Canadian subsidiary based in Barrie, Ontario called Leitner-Poma Canada Inc. Leitner-Poma's only major competitors are Doppelmayr USA, based in Salt Lake City, and Doppelmayr Canada. Leitner-Poma also supplies lifts to Australia and New Zealand. Poma of America before merger A Leitner-Poma fixed grip Alpha terminal at White Hills Ski Resort near Clarenville, NL Canada A 1988 Poma high speed quad, the Rainier Express lift, at Crystal Mountain, Washington A 1990 Poma high speed quad, the Beaver Run SuperChair at Breckenridge Ski Resort, Colorado Jean Pomagalski invented the detachable Pomalift surface tow in 1935, and first brought it to North America in 1952. The first North American Poma brand chairlift was installed in 1958 in Squaw Valley, California, for the 1960 Winter Olympics. Poma's Grand Junction, Colorado, manufacturing facility was opened in 1981 in order for Poma to better serve the North American market. In 1973, the company built its first Gondola in the United States at Big Sky Resort in Montana (removed in 2008). In the following years, Poma built gondolas at Whistler-Blackcomb, British Columbia; Squaw Valley, California (replaced by North America's only funitel); Stowe Mountain Resort, Vermont; and Stratton, Vermont, among others. In total, the company built 205 chairlifts, surface lifts, and gondolas before merging with Leitner. =Designs of POMA of America= *Detachable **Terminals ***Alpha evolution ***Performant ***Falcon Gondola ***Competition ***Challenger ***Competition Gondola ***Phatboy **Grips ***TB-41 ***Double TB-41 ***Omega T **Carriers ***Arceaux ***Competition ***Omega *Fixed Grip **Terminals ***Delta ***Alpha **Carriers ***Falcon Leitner Lifts before merger Leitner had a limited history in North America prior to its merger with Poma of America. Between 1997 and 2001, it installed 21 lifts in the United States and Canada. Customers included Fernie Alpine Resort, Kimberley Alpine Resort, and Big White in British Columbia; Mount Norquay and Lake Louise in Alberta; and Jay Peak, Vermont. =Designs of Leitner in America= *Detachable **Terminals ***Automatic ***Quintessential ***Plan de Gralba **Grips ***LA48-95 *Fixed Grip *N/A Merger of Leitner and Poma The Independence SuperChair at Breckenridge Ski Resort, a typical high speed six pack The Silver Fir high speed quad at The Summit at Snoqualmie, Washington In 2000, the Seeber Group of Italy purchased Pomagalski, S.A. of France. Although the two remained separate in Europe, the North American operations of each were combined. While it was announced as a merger of Leitner Lifts USA/Canada and Poma of America, Leitner's operations were mostly folded into Poma's. The last Leitner designed lifts were installed in 2001, and since 2002, all lifts produced by the company have been of Poma's design. In 2010, Leitner-Poma adapted the LPA detachable grip, which is cosmetically slightly different from the Omega T-Grip. The terminal design also changed with the introduction of the new grip. The first lift in the United States with the new grip was the High Noon Express at Vail Ski Resort. In 2012, Leitner-Poma adapted a new retro tower design that is a cross of the design of tower heads on Poma chairlifts built in the late 1970s and early 1980s with the design used since 1994. After the merger One of the London Eye's 32 passenger capsules In 2009, Leitner-Poma of America moved into a new headquarters in Grand Junction along with other companies owned by Leitner Technologies, including Leitwind, a manufacturer of wind turbines, and Prinoth, a maker of snow groomers. Colorado Governor Bill Ritter attended the grand opening ceremony, which took place during the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2010 at which Leitner-Poma promised to create 100 new jobs.http://www.gjsentinel.com/news/content/news/stories/2009/01/26/012709_leitner_main.html?cxtype=rss&cxsvc;=7&cxcat;=7 The company recently won the contract to build the replacement Roosevelt Island Tramway in New York City,https://www.scribd.com/doc/7704003/Roosevelt- Island-Tram-Modernization-Recommendation-and-Supplemental-Material and is also the supplier of the passenger capsules for both the London Eye Ferris wheel in England and the High Roller Ferris wheel to be built on the Las Vegas Strip. Leitner-Poma's market share continues to trail significantly behind Doppelmayr. As both Poma and as Leitner-Poma, the company has built some of the most notable lifts in America, including, among others, the only double- loading chairlift in North America (Quicksilver Super6) and the highest chairlift in North America, Imperial Express SuperChair (topping at ), both located at Breckenridge Ski Resort in Colorado. In 2016 Leitner-Poma had acquired Skytrac, a Utah-based competitor. =Designs after the merger= The Kensho SuperChair at Breckenridge Ski Resort is one of a number of new Leitner-Poma lifts with the LPA design Immediately following the Leitner-Poma merge, there were no noticeable aesthetic changes in the designs of the chairlifts, as all lifts built until 2010 utilized the Omega T-Grip and terminal. The first noticeable changes were when the LPA grip and terminal were introduced in 2010, replacing the Omega grip. Also, a new tower design was introduced in 2012, replacing a design used since 1994. Also In 2013 the LPA Carrier design was introduced while the Omega Carrier can still be optional for detachable. *Detachable **Terminals ***Phatboy Terminal ***Omega Terminal (1998-2011) ***LPA Terminal (2010-current) **Grips ***Omega T-Grip (1998-2011) ***LPA Grip (2010-current) **Carriers ***Omega Carrier ***LPA Carrier *Fixed Grip **Terminals ***Alpha Terminal (Drive) ***Z-Type (Return) ***N/A (Return) **Carriers ***Omega Carrier Skytrac Skytrac Lifts, Inc, known as Skytrac, is an American aerial ropeway engineering, manufacturing and installation company located in Salt Lake City, UT. Since 2010, Skytrac has focused on the North American majority market of new fixed-grip installations. They also provide modification and retrofitting services to the aging chairlift segment of the ski, chairlift transportation and amusement ride industries. Leitner-Poma purchased Skytrac in April 2016. This acquisition gives Leitner-Poma a stronger presence in the fixed-grip and retrofit market in North America.

The waveform may be sinusoidal or some other shape when its magnitude is plotted against time. Electronic oscillation may be intentionally caused, as in devices designed as oscillators, or it may be the result of unintentional positive feedback from the output of an electronic device to its input. The latter appears often in feedback amplifiers (such as operational amplifiers) that do not have sufficient gain or phase margins. In this case, the oscillation often interferes with or compromises the amplifier's intended function, and is known as parasitic oscillation.

It was later ported to a variety of consoles and PCs including the PC Engine, NEC PC9801, Sega Mega Drive (Genesis), Sega Saturn and PlayStation. While it never garnered the same success as its SystemSoft stablemate Daisenryaku, the game garnered a loyal following. Its success in the North American market on the Sega Genesis proved sufficient for a sequel on the Sega Saturn, and an anime art-style enhanced PlayStation version titled Disciples of Gaia with a Japanese role-playing game feel.  Gameplay  Gameplay engages players by permitting them to summon and move monsters around a board in an effort to capture towers and to eventually defeat the opponents (which are controlled either by other humans or by the computer program). Moves are based on a hexagonal board structure, such that every tile on the board is adjacent to six other tiles. Other notable features were the large variety of monsters, upgrading (\\"leveling up\\") of veteran units and control of a \\"Master\\" character who, if killed, can end the game for that player. The focus of the game is strategic, despite the fantasy-type characters that might imply an RPG element. Other than the existence of the Master character and magic in the game, the gameplay is very similar to System Soft's more hardcore modern warfare strategic wargame series Daisenryaku, with the exception that some versions of the Master of Monsters (such as Master of Monsters ‚Äì Final) series allow equippable items, weapons and armor.  Comparisons  The later Lords of Chaos by Julian Gollop of Mythos Games shares many of the same elements of summoning and tactics, along with the earlier title Chaos from 1985. David White, creator of the open-source turn-based strategy game Battle for Wesnoth, cited Master of Monsters as an inspiration. Master of Monsters was also compared to later games such as the role-playing video game series Pok√©mon (which also revolves around commanding monsters) and the real-time strategy game Starcraft.  Updates  System Soft Alpha returned the game to its strategy-based roots, and the two entries in the Master of Monsters series as originally popularized on the NEC 9801 PC were updated by System Soft Alpha with new graphics and gameplay features. Two more sequels were made for Japanese Windows and hark back to the deep strategic gameplay of the NEC PC9801 versions (as opposed to the more casual Genesis and PlayStation versions).

Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case regarding the rights of the involuntarily committed and those with intellectual disabilities. Nicholas Romeo had an intellectual disability with an infant level IQ and was committed to a Pennsylvania state hospital. He was restrained for many hours of the day and repeatedly injured.Oyez: Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982), U.S. Supreme Court Case Summary & Oral Argument The Supreme Court agreed with the Third Circuit Court of Appeals that involuntarily committed residents had the right to reasonably safe confinement conditions, no unreasonable body restraints and the habilitation they reasonably require. Background The defendants, who were management personnel at Pennhurst State School, an old state facility to which Romeo's mother had him committed when she could no longer care for him, did not dispute Romeo's right to care, habilitation, training and security. The critical issue in the case was the standard of care and whether the defendants had violated that standard, and therefore, Romeo's federally protected civil rights. The federal courts had not yet addressed this question in the context of intellectual disability. The trial court therefore looked to a then-recent Supreme Court decision holding that deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners constitutes \\"unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain\\" in violation of the 8th Amendment. The jury found for the defendants. The 3rd Circuit reversed and ordered a new trial, explaining that the standard of care should have been based on the 14th rather than the 8th Amendment and the Supreme Court agreed. However, the high court rejected the circuit court's articulation of the standard of care. Opinion of the Court The syllabus summarizes the court's holding: > Respondent [Romeo] has constitutionally protected liberty interests under > the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to reasonably safe > conditions of confinement, freedom from unreasonable bodily restraints, and > such minimally adequate training as reasonably may be required by these > interests. Whether [his] constitutional rights have been violated must be > determined by balancing these liberty interests against the relevant state > interests. The proper standard for determining whether the State has > adequately protected such rights is whether professional judgment, in fact, > was exercised. And in determining what is 'reasonable,' courts must show > deference to the judgment exercised by a qualified professional, whose > decision is presumptively valid. Subsequent developments Shortly after it was remanded to the trial court the case was settled in conjunction with a state decision to close Pennhurst in 1986, and close all other such institutions.

Life and work James Frothingham was born in Charlestown, Massachusetts. He began as a chaise painter in his father's chaise manufactory. In the Boston area, he was a student of Gilbert Stuart. In 1888, The Atlantic Monthly described him as \\"a portraitist of talent\\", adding that Stuart is quoted as having said of one of Frothingham's head portraits, \\"No man in Boston but myself can paint so good a head,\\" and that Frothingham was greatly helped by Stuart's criticisms and encouragement, although initially his Nestor had advised him to adopt another, less precarious means of earning a livelihood. The Atlantic noted that there is a detailed portrait of Samuel Dexter by Frothingham in the Harvard Memorial Hall, in which Dexter, wearing a white wig and a red cloak atop a black coat, holds a book in his hand, and appears lost in meditation, saying the flesh coloring in the painting is rather dry and parchment-like, but overall, the color is harmonious. Dunlap noted that heads depicted by James Frothingham were painted with great truth, freedom, and excellence. He painted a number of likenesses in Salem, including the wealthy merchant Elias Hasket Derby. Frothingham would have been a regional competitor to the younger Chester Harding (1792‚Äì1866), but in 1826 moved to Brooklyn in New York City. In 1828 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1831. Frothingham was the subject of a portrait bust by Joanna Quiner. His own portrait of her is held by the Beverly Public Library in Beverly, Massachusetts.

The company's shows began with marionette performances, and concluded with a revue. The name of the theater derives in part from the fact that the theater seats were former streetcar seats that could be turned to face a puppet stage at one end or the live revue stage at the other. Adjacent seats were labeled with humorous names (e.g., \\"Hot 'n Bothered,\\" \\"Salt 'n Pepper,\\" etc.), and after intermission theater-goers would \\"turn about\\" to see the show continued at the opposite end of the house. The Theater originated with a group known as the Yale Puppeteers composed notably of Forman Brown, Harry Burnett, and Richard (Roddy) Brandon. Many artists, some quite well known or soon to be well known also participated, including Odetta and Elsa Lanchester, whose brother Waldo Lanchester was a famous puppeteer in the UK. The history of the theater is documented in the film, Turnabout: the Story of the Yale Puppeteers, directed by Dan Bessie (a nephew of Harry Burnett). Brown wrote a book about the puppet troupe, and Bessie discussed the puppeteers in his memoir of his family, Rare Birds. Prior to opening Turnabout Theatre, the puppeteers had toured with their shows. Their puppets also appeared in the 1933 film I Am Suzanne.

He also was a member of the Boston Breakers in the United States Football League. He played college football at the University of Arizona. Hoopes died on August 11, 2020, aged 67.Mitchell Kent Hoopes Early years Hoopes attended Benson High School, where he played as a halfback in Class B football. He received All- Conference, All-State and All-Star honors. He enrolled at Eastern Arizona Junior College. He transferred after his sophomore season to the University of Arizona to play defensive back and punter. As a junior in 1973, he ended up concentrating on punting and was among college football's leaders with a 43.9 average, second in school history at the time. As a senior in 1974, he averaged 41.8 yards, with a long of 59. Professional career=Dallas Cowboys= Hoopes was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the eighth round (200th overall) of the 1975 NFL Draft, also known as the Dirty Dozen draft. That season he and Burton Lawless were the only rookies to earn starting jobs. Facing 4th and 13th in the season opener against the Los Angeles Rams, he ran for a critical first down without informing head coach Tom Landry and helped the team achieve an 18‚Äì7 upset victory. He averaged 39.4 yards per punt and also completed one out of 3 passing attempts for 21 yards. Playing in Super Bowl X with less than 12 minutes remaining in the fourth quarters, the Cowboys led 10-7 when Steelers backup running back Reggie Harrison broke through the middle of the offensive line and blocked a Hoopes' punt out of the end zone for a safety, cutting the lead to 10-9. The Steelers went on to win 21-17. On August 3, 1976, with the arrival of Danny White who could play quarterback and punt, he was traded to the San Diego Chargers in exchange for an eight-round draft choice (#208-Al Cleveland) in the 1977 NFL draft. =San Diego Chargers= On November 9, 1976, Hoopes was released mid-season after averaging 38.8 yards per punt and running from a punt formation on a fourth and 17 against the Houston Oilers. =Houston Oilers= On November 12, 1976, he was signed by the Houston Oilers. On November 21, he was released after one game, for averaging only 31 yards a punt. =Saint Louis Cardinals= On May 18, 1977, Hoopes signed with the Saint Louis Cardinals. He was waived on September 9. =Detroit Lions= On September 10, 1977, he was claimed off waivers by the Detroit Lions. On September 22, he was released after one game, in which he had a punt blocked and another one returned for a touchdown. =Philadelphia Eagles= On June 7, 1978, he signed as a free agent with the Philadelphia Eagles. He became part of a revolving door at punter with Rick Engles, where he was signed three times during the season. =Boston Breakers (USFL)= On November 20, 1982, he was signed by the Boston Breakers of the United States Football League. He tore his right hamstring during mini-camp. Even though he was able to recover, he later re-injured the hamstring. He announced his retirement after the 13th game of the 1983 season. He registered 23 punts for 866 yards (37.7-yard avg.) with a long of 60 yards.

They released four original albums between 1981 and 1995, but were on hiatus for most of that time. Today, they are primarily remembered for their minor hit \\"Wissenswertes √ºber Erlangen\\" (1982) as well as being the springboard for the career of Max Goldt, who emerged as a successful humorous writer in the 1990s.  Band history  Goldt and Pasemann met in West Berlin in 1978 and formed the core of the band Favorit, which soon renamed itself to Aroma Plus. Influenced by new wave and art rock, they played several gigs on the West Berlin club circuit with changing line-ups and self-released one EP and a single. In 1981, Goldt and Pasemann decided to continue working strictly as a duo under the name Foyer des Arts, an allusion to an art school in Haiti (\\"Foyer des Arts Plastiques\\"). They recorded and self-released the album Die seltsame Sekret√§rin (\\"The Strange Secretary\\"). A single off this album, \\"Eine K√∂nigin mit R√§dern untendran\\" (\\"A Queen with Wheels Attached to Her Underside\\"), became a minor hit on the Berlin club scene. At that time, the New German Wave, originally an underground phenomenon influenced by international new wave music, was entering the mainstream and major labels were eager to recruit any new talents that could be marketed as New German Wave. This led to Foyer des Arts being signed by Warner Music's German branch, WEA Records, even though they never saw themselves as part of this trend. Foyer des Arts' first album for WEA was titled Von Bullerb√º nach Babylon (1982). The title, containing a reference to Astrid Lindgren's fictional village, would translate as \\"From Bullerby to Babylon\\" or (for American ears) \\"From Noisy Village to Babylon\\". It credited Pasemann for \\"guitars, bass, arrangements\\", Goldt for \\"vocals, percussion, prepared acoustic guitar and prepared zither\\". The first single from the album was \\"Wissenswertes √ºber Erlangen\\" (\\"Things Worth Knowing About Erlangen\\"). Its lyrics humorously reflected Goldt's experience from working as a tourist guide, recounting the clich√©s spouted by guides and tourists, with a simple, nursery rhyme-like melody. \\"Wissenswertes\\" spent seven weeks on the official German singles chart, peaking at #36 in October 1982. The single misguided the mainstream audience into thinking that Foyer des Arts was a comedy act or at least represented the lighter side of German new wave, when in fact much of the album was improvised, experimental and darkish. At the same time, the target group that might actually have appreciated these virtues dismissed them due to the jovial image created by \\"Wissenswertes\\". Sales of Foyer's first album for WEA failed to meet the label's expectations and was deleted from the catalog within months of its release. WEA refused to publish any further recordings, but neither did they agree to cancel the contract, so the band was effectively on ice. In 1984, Goldt published his first solo album. It was not until after the WEA deal had expired in 1986 that Foyer des Arts finally released their second album, Die Unf√§higkeit zu fr√ºhst√ºcken (\\"The Inability to Eat Breakfast\\"] on the independent label F√ºnfundvierzig. This established them as a respected part of the German independent music scene; as such, John Peel invited them to his BBC Peel Sessions. It was followed by Ein Kuss in der Irrtumstaverne (roughly: \\"A Kiss in the Tavern of Illusion\\") in 1988. The double live album Was ist super? (\\"What Is Super?\\") (1989) marked the end of Foyer's second active phase. By that time, Goldt had begun writing a column for the satirical magazine Titanic which would eventually make him a popular author. In 1995, on Pasemann's request, the band briefly reunited to record a one-off \\"farewell album\\" entitled Die Menschen (\\"The Humans\\"). In 2000, a best-of collection entitled K√∂nnten Bienen fliegen (\\"If Bees Could Fly\\") was issued on the F√ºnfundvierzig label; in 2003, Warner Music Germany finally re- released Von Bullerb√º nach Babylon, which had been out of print for almost two decades, as a special edition compact disc. Both the track list and cover artwork were changed to bring them closer to the band's original intentions which they felt had been compromised due to WEA's interventions.

The book was published in 2006 by Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill. The historical fiction novel follows a 20th century circus drama. Gruen wrote the book as part of the National Novel Writing Month.WrimoRadio interview with Sara Gruen, November 29, 2008. Interview begins at 3 minute mark. Nanowrimo.org. Retrieved 2011-03-20.  Plot  The story is told through a series of memories by Jacob Jankowski, a 93-year-old man who lives in a nursing home. In the nursing home, Jacob's life lacks excitement and he's now a tired old man whose life is highly regimented and scheduled. Jacob's memories are ignited by the arrival of a circus to town. As his memories begin, Jacob is a 23-year old Polish American preparing for his final exams as a Cornell University veterinary student when he receives the devastating news that both of his parents have died in a car accident. Jacob's father was a veterinarian and Jacob had planned to join his practice. When Jacob learns that his parents' home has been mortgaged to pay for his tuition and that his father's practice will not become his own, he has an emotional breakdown and leaves his Ivy League school just short of graduation. In the dark of night, Jacob jumps on a train, later learning it is a circus train belonging to the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. On the train Jacob is befriended by Camel, an old man and circus veteran, who persuades his companions not to throw Jacob off the train. Camel takes him under his wing and is able to find him odd menial jobs. When the owner of the circus, Uncle Al, learns of Jacob's training as a vet, he is hired to care for the circus animals. This leads Jacob to share quarters with a little person named Walter (who is known as Kinko to the circus) and his Jack Russell terrier, Queenie. A few weeks later Jacob is summoned to examine Camel, who, after drinking \\"Jake\\" (adulterated Jamaican ginger extract) for many years, is unable to move his arms or legs. Fearing Camel will be \\"red-lighted\\" (thrown off a moving train as punishment or as severance from the circus to avoid paying wages),Interview with Sara Gruen Jacob hides him in his room. The equestrian director, August, is a brutal man who abuses the animals in his care (such as the new elephant, Rosie) and the people around him, though he can also be charming and generous. Jacob develops a guarded relationship with August and his wife, Marlena, with whom Jacob eventually falls in love. August is suspicious of their relationship and physically assaults both Marlena and Jacob. Marlena subsequently leaves August and stays at a hotel while she is not performing. Uncle Al then informs Jacob that August is a paranoid schizophrenic and utters a threat: reunite August and Marlena as a happily married couple or Walter and Camel get red-lighted. A few days later, after discovering that August has tried to see Marlena, Jacob visits her in her hotel room. Soon after he comforts her, they end up making love, and soon declare their love for each other. Marlena soon returns to the circus to perform (and have secret meetings with Jacob), but refuses to allow August near her, which makes Uncle Al furious. Soon after returning to the circus, Marlena discovers that she is pregnant. One night Jacob climbs up and jumps each train car, while the train is moving, to August's room, carrying a knife between his teeth intending to kill August. However, Jacob backs out, leaving the knife on August's pillow to send a message. When Jacob returns to his train car, he finds that no one is there, except for Queenie. He then realizes that Walter and Camel were red- lighted and that he was also supposed to have been too. As the story climaxes, several circus workers who were red-lighted come back and release the animals, causing a stampede during the performance. In the ensuing panic, Rosie (the elephant that August abused) takes a stake and drives it into August's head. August's body is then trampled in the stampede. During the ensuing melee Jacob was the only who witnessed what truly happened to August. As a result of this incident, the Benzini Brothers circus is shut down. Soon after, Uncle Al's corpse is found with a makeshift garrote around his neck. Marlena and Jacob leave, taking with them a number of the circus animals including Rosie, Queenie, and Marlena's horses. Jacob and Marlena begin their life together by joining the Ringling Bros. Circus. Later, Jacob becomes the chief veterinarian at the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago where they settled. The story then comes back to Jacob in the nursing home. Jacob is waiting for one of his children to take him to the circus. It is revealed that Jacob and Marlena married and had five children, spending the first seven years with Ringling before Jacob got a job as a vet for the Chicago Zoo. Marlena is revealed to have died a few years before Jacob was put into the nursing home. After finding out no one is coming for him, Jacob makes his way to the circus next to the nursing home on his own. He meets the manager, Charlie, and after the performance Jacob begs to be allowed to stay with the circus selling tickets. After Jacob's unrelenting, Charlie agrees and Jacob believes that he has finally come home.  Characters  * Jacob Jankowski ‚Äì The protagonist, a 93-year-old nursing home resident reminiscing on the time he spent as a circus veterinarian during the Great Depression. * Marlena ‚Äì The main love interest and a star performer with the circus. She ran away from home to join the circus and marry August, the equestrian director. She enjoys a special rapport with the horses and cares for them deeply. * August ‚Äì Marlena's husband and the head animal trainer. As a classic batterer, he is alternately charming and brutal, both to the humans and animals, particularly Rosie, a newly acquired elephant for the circus. Later in the book, it is suggested that he suffers from paranoid schizophrenic as an explanation for his violent outbursts. * Uncle Al ‚Äì The violent, abusive owner of the circus. He is known for red-lighting circus workers. If workers were deemed to have committed some particularly egregious offense, they were thrown off while the train was passing over a trestle, presumably with the hope that they would die or be seriously injured. * Kinko/Walter ‚Äì A little person with whom Jacob shares living quarters on the circus train. Initially, their relationship is rocky, but they develop a strong friendship. At the beginning of the story, he is known as Kinko. Walter is his real name and he only lets his friends call him by his actual name. He has a deep attachment to a Jack Russell terrier named Queenie (a possible allusion to a short story by Truman Capote). * Camel ‚Äì One of the first people Jacob meets when he jumps onto the train. He is a drunk who is instrumental in getting Jacob a job with the circus. When Camel gets \\"Jake Leg\\" from drinking contaminated Jamaican ginger, Jacob and Walter hide him in their car and care for him. * Rosie ‚Äì An elephant that Uncle Al buys from another circus. She is believed to be useless until it is discovered that she understands commands only in Polish. She is often the target of August's rage. * Rosemary ‚Äì A nurse in the nursing home where Jacob lives who is especially kind to Jacob, despite the fact that he can be very rude to her.  Concept  Gruen has said that the backbone of her story parallels the biblical story of Jacob in the Book of Genesis. = Title = In the beginning of the novel, Jacob mocks another nursing home resident who claims to have worked in the circus and carried the water for the elephants. The circus train only had a limited amount of water on board, and elephants can drink between 100-300 litres per day (approximately 26-80 gallons). In a later flashback to Jacob's younger years, Jacob is brought to Uncle Al, the manager of the circus, who taunts him by asking, \\"You want to carry water for elephants, I suppose?\\"  Awards and nominations  * 2006 Quill Award nominee for General FictionNominess for the 2006 Quill Awards * 2007 Alex Awards selection * Entertainment Weekly Best Novel of 2006 nominee * New York Times Best Seller list for 12 weeks in 2006 (peaked at #7 on August 20, 2006)[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0CE7D61F31F934A35752C0A9619C8B63 The New York Times, Dwight Garner, TBR: Inside the List, January 7, 2007 * Book Sense #1 pick for June 2006 * Winner of the 2007 BookBrowse award for most popular book 2007 The BookBrowse Awards (retrieved May 20, 2007) * The paperback hit #1 on the New York Times Best Seller list on July 8, 2007 New York Times Best Seller list for paperback fiction .

Visiting forces agreements are similar in intent to status of forces agreements (SOFAs). A VFA typically covers forces visiting temporarily, while a SOFA typically covers forces based in the host nation as well as visiting forces. Agreements While the United States military has the largest foreign presence and therefore accounts for most VFAs, other countries having troops temporarily serving abroad negotiate VFAs with states where they serve. =Terms of operation= VFAs are intended to clarify the terms under which foreign military is allowed to operate. Typically, a VFA is mainly concerned with the legal issues associated with military individuals and property. This may include issues like entry and exit into the country, tax liabilities, postal services, or employment terms for host-country nationals, but the most contentious issues are civil and criminal jurisdiction over the visiting forces. For civil matters, VFAs provide for how civil damages caused by the forces will be determined and paid. Criminal issues vary, but the typical provision in U.S. VFAs is that U.S. military courts will have jurisdiction over crimes committed either by a servicemember against another servicemember or by a servicemember as part of his or her military duty, but the host nation retains jurisdiction over other crimes. =Host nation concerns= In many host nations, the VFA can become a major political issue following crimes allegedly committed by visiting service members. This is especially true when the incidents involve severe crimes, such as robbery, murder, manslaughter or sex crimes, especially when the charge is defined differently between the two nations. For example, in 2005 in the Philippines, four U.S. Marines were charged with raping a local woman with whom they had been drinking. As the incident had no connection with the military duties of the accused, they were tried under Philippine law in a Philippine court, which convicted one of the accused and acquitted the others. =Political issues= The political issue of VFAs is complicated by the fact that many host countries have mixed feelings about foreign troops on their soil, and demands to renegotiate the VFA are often combined with calls for foreign troops to leave entirely. Issues of different national customs can arise. Many U.S. observers, for example, feel that host country justice systems grant a much weaker set of protections to the accused than the U.S. and that host country courts can be subject to popular pressure to deliver a guilty verdict; furthermore, that American servicemembers ordered to a foreign posting should not be forced to give up the rights they are afforded under the United States Bill of Rights. On the other hand, host country observers having no local counterpart to the Bill of Rights often feel that this is an irrelevant excuse for demanding special treatment, and resembles the extraterritorial agreements demanded by Western countries during the colonial era. One host country where such sentiment is widespread, South Korea, itself has forces in Kyrgyzstan and has negotiated a SOFA that confers total immunity to its servicemembers from prosecution by Kyrgyz authorities for any crime whatsoever, something far in excess of the privileges many South Koreans object to in their nation's SOFA with the U.S. To many U.S. observers, the fact that most accused criminals eventually end up being tried in a local court and found guilty proves that the system is working; to some host country observers, it reinforces the perception that the VFA protects the guilty and makes the exceptions more glaring.

Biography Neil MacKenzie (he never used his given first name) was born in London in 1926 and attended a succession of schools in Southern England. In 1943, aged 17, he enlisted in the British Army. In 1945 and 1946 he served as a soldier on the North-West Frontier Province of British India, where he learned Pashto. Thus acquainted with Iranian languages, he acquired a Bachelor's degree in New Persian and a Master's degree in Old- and Middle Persian at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) of the University of London. His PhD dissertation, Kurdish Dialect Studies (1957, published 1961‚Äì1962), established his reputation as an Iranist and linguist. At SOAS, MacKenzie was appointed Lecturer in Kurdish in 1955, a position that was extended to include all Iranian languages in 1961. He was promoted to Reader in 1965, a post he held until 1975 when he received an appointment as Chair of Oriental Philology at the University of G√∂ttingen in Germany. MacKenzie retired from that position in 1994 and settled in Bangor, North Wales. Upon his return to Britain, MacKenzie was elected as a Fellow of the British Academy. David Neil MacKenzie died on 13 October 2001 in Bangor, aged 75. He was survived by three sons and one daughter.

MacKenzie's contribution to Pashto, Gorani and Kurdish, just to name a few, is the reason for a \\"former colleague's\\" description of \\"poor MacKenzie\\" as \\"the man who knows all the dialects and none of the languages.\\" His Concise Pahlavi Dictionary (1971) was not only one of his most important works, but remains the authoritative lexicographic reference on the language of the 9th-12th century Zoroastrian texts. His Khwarezmian dictionary remained unfinished at the time of his death. In his obituary, MacKenzie is noted to have been \\"a polyglot whose linguistic knowledge was remarkable in both range and depth. Generally recognised as the world's leading authority on modern Kurdish and medieval Khwarezmian, he also made distinguished contributions to the study of many other Iranian languages, including Pashto, Pahlavi and Sogdian, at the same time displaying enviable competence in non-Iranian languages such as Arabic and Chinese.\\" See also * Iranian Studies * List of Iranists Bibliography Category:1926 births Category:2001 deaths Category:British Army personnel of World War II Category:Iranologists Category:Linguists of Kurdish Category:Kurdish language Category:Linguists from the United Kingdom Category:Alumni of SOAS University of London Category:Academics of SOAS University of London Category:University of G√∂ttingen faculty Category:Linguists of Iranian languages Category:Fellows of the British Academy Category:Linguists of Persian Category:20th-century linguists ","title":"David Neil MacKenzie"},{"id":"10392477","text":"Butterly is the name of: *Caoimhe Butterly (born 1978), Irish human rights activist *Daniel Butterly (born 1970), American sports administrator *Kathy Butterly (born 1963), American sculptor *Michelle Butterly (born 1970), English actress *Butterly (1787 cricketer), English first-class cricketer See also *Butterley, a village in Derbyshire, England ","title":"Butterly"},{"id":"10392485","text":"Colonel John Blossett was an Irish soldier who led the second British Legion to aid Simon Bolivar in the wars of independence against Spain.

A centre-half, he started his career at his hometown club Swansea Town and made his professional debut in 1956. He joined Middlesbrough in 1962 for a club record fee of ¬£25,000 and later played for Swindon Town. During his career, he also represented Wales at under-23 level and gained 12 caps at senior level. After retiring from football, he built a property portfolio that included several hotels and businesses in the Swansea area before, rejoining the football club as a member of the board. In 2011, he led a consortium in a takeover that is credited with saving the club from financial ruin. His lifelong association with the city of Swansea has seen him often referred to as \\"Mr. Swansea\\". Early life Nurse was born in a one- room apartment where his parents lived in the district of Fforestfach in Swansea in 1937. His parents, both from the Swansea area, soon moved to a two bedroom house with no electricity or central heating in Alice Street in the nearby area of Cwmbwrla. The outbreak of World War II in 1939 saw the area sustain heavy bombing due to the nearby Cwmfelin Steelworks and Nurse's father was called up for service during the hostilities, spending several years away from the family. Several other notable footballers were raised in Alice Street including the Charles brothers: John and Mel, Jackie Roberts and Ernie Jones. The group all attended the same school and played football at the local park, using a tennis ball, as no local family could afford a football at the time. Nurse was active in numerous sports, taking part in long-jump and javelin as well as captaining his school's football and cricket teams. At the age of 14, he was selected to play for the Swansea schoolboys team and played matches for the side at Vetch Field. The following year, he was selected to play for Wales' schoolboys and played in a 3‚Äì3 draw with England at Wembley Stadium, the opposition side containing Bobby Charlton and Wilf McGuinness. Outside football, Nurse was also a keen carpenter and briefly worked as an apprentice for a local carpenter before his football career progressed. Club career=Swansea Town= Having represented Wales at schoolboy level, Nurse attracted attention from several clubs and was offered contracts with several sides, including Arsenal, Bristol Rovers and West Bromwich Albion, but rejected them all as he did not want to leave Swansea. In 1952, Glyn Evans, a scout for Swansea Town, travelled to Nurse's new family home in Penlan and offered him a place in the club's youth system. During this time, the club's youth players were also required to perform several other jobs, such as sweeping stands, moving turf and cleaning kits, only training twice a week and playing for the club's reserve side in the amateur Welsh leagues on weekends. After impressing for the reserves, Nurse signed professional terms with the club in June 1955 before being handed his professional debut on 24 March 1956 in a 6‚Äì1 victory over Leicester City, following an injury to first choice Tom Kiley. He was informed of his debut by a local sports reporter, Les Bailey, who covered Swansea Town matches and lived nearby to him. His performances in the first-team convinced Swansea to drop Kiley from the side and also cancel a ¬£5000 transfer deal for Cardiff City defender Stan Montgomery. However, at the age of 18, Nurse was called up for his national service, being stationed in Worcester with the Royal Engineers. He represented his regiment in football, playing alongside Dave Mackay and against George Kirby. His unit was eventually moved to Hong Kong but, as Nurse was playing football for the regiment and occasionally for Swansea Town when he was granted leave, he was allowed to stay in the UK. After being promoted to corporal on completion of a ten-week training course, he was stationed in Fleet, Hampshire. After completing his national service, Nurse was demobbed in April 1958 returned to Swansea and established himself in the first-team. He was ever-present during the 1959‚Äì60 season and, helped the club win the Welsh Cup in 1961. Shortly after the Munich air disaster, Welsh national team manager Jimmy Murphy was appointed caretaker manager of Manchester United. During the club's restructuring after the crash, they organised a friendly match against Swansea mainly to scout Nurse and his performance led them to offer ¬£35,000 for him, but Swansea turned the offer down. However, two years later, Middlesbrough saw an offer of ¬£25,000, a club record fee, accepted. Nurse wanted to remain in Wales, but the club made it clear he had no future there if he refused to move. =Later career= After signing for Middlesbrough on a wage of ¬£25 a week, he made his debut against Grimsby Town in a 4‚Äì3 victory. Within a week of joining, he was made captain. During a night out in his time at Middlesbrough, Nurse was once mistaken for train robber Ronnie Biggs. He was pulled over by police and questioned before his real identity was established. In 1965, Nurse became unsettled after the appointment of new manager Raich Carter and, with his wife homesick, Middlesbrough placed him on the transfer list. He moved back to the West Country, joining Swindon Town in August for ¬£15,000. Appointed club captain, he made his debut in a 1‚Äì0 defeat to Hull City the following month. Nurse left Swindon in September 1968 and returned to live in Swansea. He had considered retirement in order to focus on his business ventures but was approached by Swansea manager Billy Lucas who visited Nurse's mother's house, where he was staying with his wife until they could purchase their own home, having been told that Nurse was living in Swansea again. Lucas departed the club the following year and was replaced by Roy Bentley who led the club to promotion from the Third Division in 1969. He remained with the club until 1971 when Bentley introduced afternoon training sessions, the players having previously only trained in the mornings. The move was designed to keep the club's younger players focused by allowing less free time but Nurse grew frustrated as he managed his business interests in the afternoons and decided to retire from playing. Nurse played a dozen games for the Welsh national team, limited by the players of the side, including John Charles and Mike England. Non-playing career During his playing career, Nurse invested in several Bed and breakfast hotels in the Oystermouth area of Swansea. He and his wife Marion had decided on the venture after traveling back to the city for the birth of their first child. He would go on to purchase several hotels in the town and also began developing properties in the area for resale. He later joined the board at Swansea City. At the start of the 21st century, Swansea City was in crisis and was seeking a new owner. The difficult times saw an attempt to sack seven players, and in November 2001, Nurse resigned from the board. The following day, he bought the club's ¬£801,000 debt from former owners Ninth Floor plc. On 19 January 2002, Swansea was finally sold, after a bitter stand-off with a consortium headed by Nurse which was supported by the majority of the club's fans. In order to raise the ¬£300,000 required to remove chairman Tony Petty, Nurse secured loans against many of his own properties and did so having not seen the club's financial records beforehand. His efforts in saving the club from folding were listed as one of the main factors when he was awarded the Freedom of the City in Swansea. He now runs a B&B; Hotel in Swansea called Seahaven Hotel.

He is currently part of the coaching set-up at Anderlecht, briefly managing the club in 2019. He began his playing career with Manchester United, where he was a member of the 1992 youth team, before leaving the club in 1997. He spent the rest of his career playing for a number of Football League and Welsh Premier League clubs. He was capped once for Wales, in a match against Switzerland. Davies went into coaching towards the end of his career, where he was a youth team coach at Chester City. He was caretaker manager of the club in 2007 and 2008, before being given the position full-time, saving the club from relegation. Davies was sacked in late 2008, following a difficult start to the 2008‚Äì09 season, but was reappointed as a youth team coach a month later. In 2010, Davies joined Manchester City, continuing his involvement in youth football. He was assistant to Patrick Vieira during the Frenchman's time as EDS manager, and succeeded him in the role in 2016, after he joined New York City. Davies was then Head of Academy Coaching for the 2018‚Äì19 season, before following City captain Vincent Kompany to Anderlecht in his dual role as player-manager. When Kompany stepped down from managerial duties, Davies took the reins at the Belgian club, but only managed to get four points from a possible fifteen, and was replaced in the role by Franky Vercauteren. Playing career During his career he played for a few English clubs in the 1990s, after starting out at Manchester United. He scored the opening goal in a 4‚Äì0 Champions League win against Galatasaray and played 20 first team games for the club, although he failed to add any more goals. He was part of an acclaimed batch of youngsters to come through the United ranks in this period, after winning the FA Youth Cup in 1992, with his colleagues who lifted the trophy including David Beckham, Nicky Butt and Gary Neville. Although born in England, Davies was capped for the Welsh national team against Switzerland in 1996. After leaving Manchester United for Luton Town in a ¬£150,000 deal in August 1997, Davies struggled to recapture his early promise and his league career was to end with spells with Macclesfield Town and Rochdale. He then crossed the Welsh border, becoming Peter Davenport's first signing at Bangor City in the Welsh Premier League in 2001. He was named as the Welsh Premier League's player of the season in 2002‚Äì03. He also played for Rhyl and Total Network Solutions and would briefly join Airbus UK. Coaching and management In 2006, Davies joined the coaching staff at Chester City, predominantly as part of the youth set-up. In April 2007, he was appointed as the club's caretaker manager after the departure of Mark Wright. He took charge for the final game of the season, as Chester lost 2‚Äì0 at Lincoln City. Despite the loss, Davies was offered an interview for the job on a permanent basis but Bobby Williamson was subsequently appointed, although Davies remained at the club as youth team manager. The following March, Davies was again appointed as Chester's caretaker manager following Williamson's sacking. Despite losing his two games in caretaker charge, Davies was named manager until the end of the season on 11 March 2008. His first win followed in a 2‚Äì1 success against Darlington on 22 March and Chester went on to clinch survival in their penultimate match of the season with a 0‚Äì0 draw against Stockport County. A few days earlier, Davies celebrated his 34th birthday with a new two-year contract at the club. Davies endured a difficult start to the 2008‚Äì09 season, with Chester conceding six to both Dagenham & Redbridge and Rochdale in the first three months of the season and making early exits from all three cup competitions. He was sacked on 10 November 2008. Exactly a month later, it was announced Davies had returned to Chester as youth team manager. In 2010, Davies joined Manchester City as part of their youth coaching programme. From 2013 to 2015, he was assistant to EDS manager Patrick Vieira. In January 2016, Davies succeeded Vieira as manager, when the Frenchman left the club to join New York City. He left the position in 2018 to become Head of Academy Coaching, with specific focus on the younger age groups. In July 2019, Davies joined Vincent Kompany as part of the coaching set-up at Anderlecht. On 22 August, Davies became the head coach, since Kompany decided to step down from managerial duties on the pitch, to focus primarily on being a player. His first match in charge was a 1‚Äì0 loss to Genk, and his second brought Anderlecht their first win of the season, with a 1‚Äì0 win over Standard Li√®ge. However, in his next three games, Davies could only manage a goalless draw against Waasland-Beveren. On 3 October, Davies was demoted back to assistant manager, with the club appointing former manager Franky Vercauteren. According to journalist Kristof Terreur, Davies was seen as a \\"yes man who does what he thinks is right for the team\\". His reputation in press conferences was considered boring, since Kompany was not involved. Terreur also noted that it had gotten to the point that there was just one journalist at his press conference because everyone had given up listening to him.

It is the sequel to the similarly themed Attack from Mars. This game was the first to use the Williams Pinball 2000 system that overlays interactive video onto the mechanical playfield (see also Star Wars Episode I). An additional first was the default absence of a replay/special. Instead of awarding the player a free game when reaching a certain number of points, it was decided to rather award extra balls (default at 50 million and 200 million). This default behaviour can be changed by the operator though. Additionally the match sequence at the end of a pinball game (a random free play award) can be disabled. This was originally disabled in 1994's Road Show pinball machine by default, too, but was since enabled by default again. Gameplay Man playing Revenge from Mars. There are 9 different main modes which can each be completed to obtain a Saucer light. These 9 modes are divided into 3 different groups and are listed below. The initial mode begins upon its selection at the start of the game (either manually with the action buttons or automatically after the choice times out). The modes move from left to right in sequence automatically after the previous mode has been completed (i.e. there is no \\"start mode\\" shot), with the exception of the middle group (Saucer) which begins after one of the other two mode groups has been completed. Each individual mode continues until it has been completed, even between balls. When a mode has been completed, the video will display a report. If the mode is completed properly according to the directions on the video display, the player will receive a \\"Flawless\\" rating. This rating must be achieved in order to obtain one Saucer light. Thus completing all of these modes with a Flawless rating will light all 9 Saucer lights. This, along with the other 2 requirements (Martian Multiball and Mothership Multiball), will light Attack Mars. Saucer lights can also be obtained in other ways (Martian Multiball, Stroke of Luck, Bonus Wave Multiball, Super Jackpot), so getting Flawless on all (or even any) of these modes is not a requirement. =Fuel= * Alien Abduction -- The scene is in front of the White House. A large saucer is hovering overhead, with smaller saucers appearing to the sides. Various objects (sportscars, cows, etc.) appear at the sides as well, and the smaller UFOs attempt to use their tractor beams to steal these objects (these objects can be cycled through by using the Action buttons). The scoring is based on saving the item being beamed up and goes up to 3 million. Regardless of where an item's value starts, it counts down fairly rapidly (i.e. a hurry-up) once the Martians start abducting it. Shooting the Martian to save the item immediately awards the current item's value, and adds the item value to the mode \\"jackpot\\" (which starts at 1M). Once all items have been rescued and the center ramp lights, the mode jackpot will start counting down as a hurry-up until you shoot the ramp to collect. Hitting the center targets, ramps and loops will destroy the smaller UFOs, as will the missiles. After seven of the smaller saucers are destroyed, one final hit up the middle Mini ramp will destroy the large saucer, ending the mode. Destroying all seven saucers will award a Flawless rating and a Saucer light. The whole mode features various audio samples made by a Bill Clinton impersonator. * Martian Happy Hour -- In this mode, there are five Martians sitting at the bar in various states of inebriation, cracking bad human jokes, consuming various flammable substances and engaging in dangerous pastimes. Overhead are suspended three \\"kegs\\" of kerosene, gasoline and propane, which can be set off by the Missiles with devastating effects. The Martians on each of the ramps can be destroyed by one hit apiece, the ones on the Capture Lane and Martian target (left of the Center Target bank) take two hits apiece, and the one in the middle takes three hits (these hit numbers can be adjusted by the difficulty setting). Each Martian destroyed awards 1.5M points. Each orbit will set off one of the kegs on the sides for 4M apiece. To destroy the center keg, one must shoot the right ramp (after taking care of the Martian that's blocking the way) and the center ramp will briefly pop up. If you successfully make this shot, it is worth 6M points. (Note: destroying all three kegs will immediately blow up the bar, ending the mode and possibly denying you of a Flawless rating unless you've already killed all the Martians). When the three center Martians are destroyed, the center ramp will pop up to end the mode, awarding 2M for any remaining kegs at the top of the screen. Destroying all five Martians will award a Flawless rating and Saucer Light. * Secret Weapon -- This mode is depicted as hand-to-hand combat between the ABE (a giant robotic version of Abraham Lincoln) and one of the Big-O-Martians. a \\"life bar\\" is shown at the top for the Martian, and various shots will cut down this life bar. Finally, when the life bar is down all the way, in a callback to the Mortal Kombat games, \\"Finish him!\\" appears on the screen, and one last shot will send the Martian flying upwards and hitting the saucer, causing it to explode dramatically. =Saucer= * Tower Struggle -- The Leaning Tower of Pisa is being used for a game of Tug-of-War by four Martians. Shoot the left and right ramps to destroy the saucers with one hit apiece, and the two Martians that are located on the lock shot and the top Martian light. As in several other modes, there is a \\"life bar\\" which is decreased by shooting the tower (Center Target Bank), and enough hits will eventually raise the ramp to end the mode. Destroying the two Martians and saucers will immediately raise the center Mini ramp to end the mode with one more shot. All four must be destroyed for a Flawless rating. * Mystery Mode (?) -- This mode will randomly select one of the following four modes: ** Martian Aerobics -- This mode is a tribute to Space Invaders. By shooting any shot, some missiles will launch at the 24 moving Martians on the screen. Sometimes while playing this mode, a huge saucer floats down into the middle of the image. One can shoot it, but it is unclear yet whether or not one can destroy it without completing the mode the usual way. Destroy all 24 before they get to the bottom of the screen to finish the mode and receive a saucer light. ** Martian Bowling -- 10 Martians are moving across the screen. The action buttons are used to aim while the real pinball will resemble a bowling ball that can hit the Martian shaped pins. ** Martian Autopsy -- At the start of the mode, a hurry-up runs on the center shot, starting at 3M. Whatever value one collects is locked in as the value for each object during the rest of the mode. 10 objects must be collected for a Flawless rating (and Saucer Light). ** Martian Tank -- This mode is the toughest to complete. Basically there is a moving tank target with two Martians sitting aboard on both sides. The object is to destroy both Martians by shooting the ramps at the right moment. Destroying both Martians and the tank afterwards, a Flawless rating is received. * Drive-In Demolition -- The last saucer mode pays homage to the \\"Move Your Car\\" mode from Creature from the Black Lagoon, but this time, it's the Martians blocking the screen. As with Secret Weapon, all shots will inflict damage (there is a power bar that tells how much damage is still left to do). In order to get a saucer light one must complete the meter all the way down. =Weapons= * Paris in Peril -- This mode begins with a flying saucer located over the Eiffel Tower. There is a catapult in the center which is used to fire various objects (watermelons, spiked balls, cows, etc.) at the saucer. Hitting the center targets will fire the catapult, with each hit doing 13% damage (this is operator adjustable and can be up to 25% or 4 hits to destroy). The missile lanes on the outside will do 25% damage to the saucer. After the saucer is hit once, 4 Martians will parachute in (some may not be initially visible as they float off of the screen) on the left and right ramps, the Capture lane and the Martian target to the left of the Center Target Bank. Each Martian can be destroyed by one hit from the ball, and are worth 1M, 1.5M, 2M, and 5M. All 4 must be destroyed for a Flawless rating. You can complete this mode with or without destroying the Martians by hitting the middle X times (the side shots do 2x the middle damage). After 8 hits of damage (again, operator adjustable), the center Mini Ramp will pop up, and one more shot will destroy the saucer, ending the mode and earning points. * Big-O-Beam -- This mode is set on a farm, where the livestock seem to have taken on rather large proportions. There is a saucer hovering over the barn, and large barnyard animals to the side. Hitting the center targets will cause the barn to leap up and damage the saucer, and now, with 2M points per hit. The ramps and orbits will, in addition to awarding missiles, shrink the currently enlarged animals for 4M apiece. There are 4 animals (a cow, a duck, a pig and a chicken) which need to be \\"saved\\" for a Flawless rating. There is \\"Life bar\\" above the saucer that shows how much damage is left--once this is depleted the center mini ramp will raise and light. Shrinking all 4 animals will also cause the center ramp to raise and light to finish the mode, so you don't have to deplete the life bar. Overall, this mode is a good one to start out the game on, as this one is a higher-point mode than several others. * Mars Kneads Women -- There are six television screens you can tune in on. You can change the currently playing show on these by using the Action Buttons. The object here is to tune into a screen and watch the show. You can always cancel a show by pressing all 4 buttons while it is playing. The left TV screens can be viewed by either hitting the loop or the left ramp/middle ramp combo. Same goes for the right side. If you shoot either the left or right ramp, the center ramp will pop up for a shot to watch a show. Shooting the orbits is a better way to go, as this will start the show immediately and save you a shot (the rollover lanes will register here, but the jets are disabled, and the ball isn't returned to play until the show is over or cancelled). The center targets will light the 2 center TV screens (which, again, can be watched via the center ramp shot). Finally, after the two center TV screens have been watched, one more center ramp shot will destroy the console for a point value between 2-5M based on how many TVs were watched during the mode. Note, the screen will say \\"Destroy the Console\\" to let you know that the ramp shot will end the mode, so if you are not finished viewing all of the screens, shoot the remaining shot(s), watch the shows, then destroy the console to get Flawless. You must view all six TV stations to obtain a Flawless rating. Multiball modes There are six multiball modes in Revenge from Mars: * Martian Multiball (2-ball) * Regular Multiball (3-ball) * Bonus Wave Multiballs (Fuel, Saucer & Weapons) (4-ball) * Mothership Multiball (4-ball) * Hypno Multiball (extendable 2-ball) * Attack Mars (Wizard Mode, 4-ball) These rules were extended and tweaked almost 20 years after the initial release by unofficial updates (see https://www.mypinballs.com/software/rfm/code_updates.jsp), also introducing formerly unused sounds and graphics found in the ROMs. External links * *Revenge from Mars rule sheet *Recent Auction Results for Revenge from Mars *The making of Revenge from Mars is profiled in Tilt: The Battle to Save Pinball (DVD movie/documentary) (official web site) Category:1999 pinball machines Category:Bally pinball machines ","title":"Revenge from Mars"},{"id":"10392674","text":"Catalogue 2005 is the sixth compilation album by Buck-Tick, released on December 7, 2005.

He was sent as Florentine ambassador to the court of Alfonso of Naples. Vespasiano da Bisticci included him among the illustrious men of his generation whose careers deserved an article in his Vite di uomini illustri del secolo XVPublished as Vite di uomini illustri del secolo xv by Ludovico Frati, Bologna, 1892-93; a translation was reprinted as The Vespasiano Memoirs: Lives of Illustrious Men of the XV Century (Renaissance Society of America Reprint Texts) 1997. vita. Biography Palmieri was born to a middle-class family who held prominent positions in the city. He was educated in Florence and ran a profitable apothecary shop; like his father he pursued a career in civil service, becoming a well known and respected public official between 1432 and 1475 holding many posts and titles. At the end of his life, he commissioned from the Florentine painter Francesco Botticini (1446‚Äì1498) a monumental Assumption of the VirginNow at the National Gallery, London. for the church of the Benedictine nunnery of San Pier Maggiore in Florence, where the Palmieri had their chapel; in the painting are the kneeling donor portraits of Matteo and his wife Niccolosa de' Serragli.Rolf Bagemihl, \\"Francesco Botticini's Palmieri Altar-Piece\\", The Burlington Magazine 138 No. 1118 (May 1996), pp. 308-314. Assumption of the Virgin, by Francesco Botticini, 1475-77 (National Gallery, London) Works Palmieri firmly believed in the humanist ideal that virt√π was a combination of both learning and political action, and so in concordance with his political life, he was also an author. He wrote in both Latin and Italian. Among his Latin works are Liber de temporibus (Book of Epochs), a universal chronicle of the world from the time of creation to his present day; the De captivitate liber (The Capture of Pisa), an account of the Florentine capture of Pisa in 1406; and a biography of Niccol√≤ Acciaioli, translated into Italian by Donato Acciaioli. In Italian Palmieri wrote a three-book poem La citt√† di vita (\\"The City of Life\\") in 1465, which is an imitation of Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy. The poem was unpublished in his lifetime, and upon its appearance in print was condemned by the Church as heretical, thus after his death Palmieri's body was removed from the Church of San Pier Maggiore and an effigy of him was burned. Palmieri's best-known work as a humanist is Della vita civile (\\"On Civic Life\\"; printed 1528), composed in 1429 and circulated between 1435 and 1440. It is a treatise discussing the qualities of the ideal citizen. It is written as series of dialogs in four books, set in a country house in Mugello during the plague of 1430, with Agnolo Pandolfini, a rich Florentine merchant, as the main speaker. Depending for the first dialogue upon Quintilian's Institutio oratoria and for the last three on Cicero's De officiis,Specifics are discussed in Claudio Finzi, Matteo Palmieri: dalla 'Vita Civile' alla 'Citt√†di Vita' (Rome) 1984. it discusses the physical and intellectual development of children, the moral life of a citizen, and the contrasting tensions between what is useful and what is honest. As well as classic writers such as Cicero, Quintilian and Plutarch, it draws on Palmieri's own personal experiences as a civil servant. His primary emphasis and advocacy is on the need for a good education and taking an active part in the life of the city. Education at an early age he considered crucial to improve the human capacity to do good for others and the community.

It was a small, single-engine, single-seat, low-wing monoplane of wooden construction, normally powered by a six-cylinder de Havilland Gipsy Six piston engine. During its racing career it set many records and was considered a significant, efficient design, one that eventually reached a top speed of 265 mph (425 km/h) on a modest 205 hp (153 kW) in its final 1939 form. A modern- day observer has characterised the Mew Gull as \\"the Holy Grail of British air racing\\". During the second half of the 1930s, Mew Gulls were dominant in air- racing in the UK and consistently recorded the fastest times until the outbreak of war stopped all civilian flying in late 1939. Design and development With the Percival Gull already making a name for itself as a racer, over several months in 1933‚Äì1934, Capt. Edgar W. Percival designed and built a single-seat racer derivative initially named the E1 'Mew Gull'. This was developed into the E2, E2H and the E3H variants between 1934 and 1938. The sometimes-used designation \\"P6\\" is incorrect; this retrospective tag was created after Percival left the company and long after the Mew Gulls were built, thus no Mew Gulls were ever built as \\"P6s\\". With the exception of the sole E3H, G-AFAA ‚Äì which was built after the company moved to Luton, all of the Mew gulls were built in the small factory at Gravesend. The E3H, whilst very strongly visually resembling the E2H, was in truth a totally new and different machine, with each element differing from its predecessor in some way. It was most certainly not a 'clipped-wing' version of the E2H as it has sometimes been described. Structurally, there was very little commonality of parts between the Gulls IV/ VI/ Vega Gull and the Mew Gull, other than a few minor components. All of the Gulls, however, did use a similar generic structure. Proprietary equipment such as engines, airscrews, spinners, instruments, undercarriage legs, wheels and tyres were generally common to all series. The Mew Gulls (apart from the E1 in its initial configuration) used a fixed, conventional oleomatic main undercarriage and a fully castoring tailskid. Small manually operated, split trailing-edge wing flaps were incorporated into the mainplanes, but were \\"...singularly ineffective even when fully extended\\". The aircraft was designed for handicapped air racing which gained huge popularity in the UK during the 1920s and especially 1930s ‚Äì the so-called \\"Golden Age\\" of aviation. The King's Cup Race, an annual handicapped air racing event developed to aid in the development of British light aircraft, was considered to be the \\"Blue-Riband\\" event. Ultimately, Mew Gulls went on to win this event four times. The prototype G-ACND first flew in March 1934 with a 165 hp Napier Javelin, but it was replaced with a more powerful and reliable 200 hp Gipsy Six engine, fitted with a fixed-pitch airscrew, prior to its first race. Type history The King's Cup was a handicap race dating back to 1922; each racing result was compared to the time that the committee decided each contestant should have completed the course. The greater the margin by which an entry beat its prescribed time, the better its chance of winning. Initially King George V was to present a cup to the winner, and like the Schneider Trophy, the same cup would be engraved and awarded to the new winner each year. After the first year's race it was decided that a new cup would be presented each year. Percival entered the King's Cup Race in July 1934, but failed to place. The original E1 was redesigned following an accident into the much-refined E2 configuration, with much of the design work completed by Arthur Bage. In July 1935, with a 180 hp French R√©gnier installed, G-ACND competed in the Coupe Armand Esders, a race of 1,046 miles from Deauville, France to Cannes and back. The Mew Gull was flown by Count de Chateaubrun, the Percival representative in France, and averaged 188 mph in the race. Immediately after, the original British de Havilland Gipsy Six was reinstalled. Guy de Chateaubrun subsequently became the only pilot to bail out of a Mew Gull, abandoning G-ACND because of fog. In September 1935 Percival placed 1st in a race, and in July 1936 he finished 4th in the King's Cup Race flying G-AEKL, the third Mew Gull and first \\"production\\" E2H. Later in August, Percival finished 7th in the 174-mile race for the Folkestone Trophy. In September 1936 G-AEKL, having previously been Edgar Percival's private mount, was re-engined and modified to enter in the Schlesinger Race. The Schlesinger African Air Race was a race from England to South Africa (6,154 miles), but G-AEKL was withdrawn ten days before the Schlesinger following a fatal taxiing accident at Liverpool Speke Airport. Two other E2H Mew Gulls were entered, both of which had been built at the same time to the same specification as the modified KL. Both failed to finish the race to South Africa. In the 1937 King's Cup Race, the rebuilt and re-painted G-AEKL was 1st with Charles Gardner at the controls in his house-colours of dark blue with pale-blue lettering and trim (See Flight of the Mew Gull, p91.). He averaged 234 mph over the 1,442-mile course. Percival flew his latest E3H \\"Super\\"-Mew G-AFAA, the sixth and last Mew Gull built, to a third- place finish and still another E2H, G-AEXF was raced by Alex Henshaw. The 1938 King's Cup Race was a 1,012 mile event and this time, Alex Henshaw's much modified E2H G-AEXF came in 1st at 236 mph and Giles Guthrie in his red \\"standard\\" E2H G-AEKL placed 2nd. Henshaw's win set a class record which, as of 2020, still stands. Edgar Percival flew a third Mew Gull, the E3H (G-AFAA) and finished 6th. Percival might easily have won, but as well as being made scratch-man by the Handicappers, he left the fine-tuning of his airscrew pitches until just before the race and his ground-crew were still tinkering with them as Alex Henshaw took off. At this time the Bracket-Type airscrew simply did not have the pitch-range to cope with the exceptionally wide speed range of the E3H (59‚Äì265 mph). An optimisation for either cruise or takeoff and climb would inevitably compromise the other. Alex Henshaw attempted to take the England ‚Äì Cape Town Record in 1939, taking off on 5 February 1939 from Gravesend Airport, landing at Wingfield Aerodrome at the Cape the next day, covering the 6,377 miles course in 39 hours and 25 minutes, averaging 209.44 mph while in the air. The return trip was just 11 minutes longer. During all of Alex Henshaw's adventures in this aircraft, it was never damaged. Mew Gull G-AEXF wearing racing number 97 when competing in the 1953 UK National Air Races at Wolverhampton (Pendeford) airfield in May 1953 Henshaw sold G-AEXF to Frenchman Victor Vermoral in late 1939. During the Second World War, the aircraft was stored in a hangar in France with several owners continuing to hide it from German authorities. In 1950, Hugh Scrope found and bought it, and with Doug Bianchi's help, refurbished the aircraft to fly it back home to England. After restoration, G-AEXF continued its racing career but it was damaged in a landing accident in August 1951 at Shoreham. J.N. Somers, the next owner repaired it and raced G-AEXF again. A new owner, Ernest Crabtree, flew it last in the 1965 Manx Air Derby. By this time however, other owners had further altered this historic aircraft, resulting in lowered performance. Eventually, the derelict aircraft found its way into the hands of a poorly run museum, where it became damp, had its wings crudely sawn off, and many parts lost to souvenir hunters. In this state, Tom Storey and Martin Barraclough acquired the aircraft and rebuilt it during the late 1970s. Wishing to make the aircraft more practical to operate, a configuration closer to its original design was chosen, making G-AEXF look somewhat like an E2H/E3H hybrid, painted in the white and British Racing Green she wore when owned by Alex Henshaw in the 1930s. XF was again damaged at Redhill in late 1983, when an Auster taxied into it. The aircraft continued to be operated in the configuration as rebuilt by Storey and Barraclough until it was offered for sale. Desmond Penrose was the next owner, who based the machine at Old Warden. The aircraft was written off two further times: one at the time of purchase and again a few years later. After the first of these rebuilds, the machine was re-configured to resemble its configuration for the 1939 Cape flight. G-AEXF was extensively rebuilt yet again for a third time and continued to operate from Old Warden for some time until sold-on. In 2002, G-AEXF was sold to Rob Fleming and was operated by The Real Aeroplane Company at the Breighton Aerodrome, Yorkshire, UK. It was temporarily shipped over to the US to fly in a \\"demonstration race\\" at the 2003 National Championship Air Races at Reno, Nevada, the first Mew Gull to touch American soil. In 2012, G-AEXF was operating from Breighton, 76 years after her original incarnation. In October 2013 G-AEXF was sold to the Shuttleworth Collection at Old Warden, Bedfordshire, UK, where it remains flying as part of the museum. A UK Registered replica of a Mew Gull, G-HEKL, is now airworthy in the UK. Variants The Mew Gulls were a family of \\"half-siblings,\\" each tailored to the customer's demands. Five were built: =G-ACND= The prototype Mew Gull, designated Type E.1 was fitted with a Napier Javelin engine and first flew in March 1934. In October 1935, G-ACND was destroyed in a crash near Angoul√™me during the Coupe Michelin. Percival Mew Gull G-ACND photo from Le Pontentiel A√©rien Mondial 1936 The aircraft was almost completely rebuilt as the Type E.2, powered by a 200 hp Gipsy Six. It was temporarily fitted with a smaller 180 hp Regnier engine to qualify for the Coupe Armand Esders of 1935. With the Gipsy Six reinstated, the aircraft flew in a number of later races and won the Folkestone Trophy Race. =G-AEKL= G-HEKL in 2015, a replica of the Percival Mew Gull G-AEKL. The E.2H. Fitted with a De Havilland Gipsy Six and flown by Edgar Percival in the King's Cup and Folkestone Trophy Races of 1936. Sold and re-engined with a Gipsy Six Series II, G-AEKL was entered in the Schlesinger Race along withZS-AHM and ZS-AHO. However, the aircraft was damaged in a fatal accident at Liverpool Speke Airport that autumn, Tom Campbell Black being killed. Rebuilt in 1937, G-AEKL won the Newcastle Race for its new owner. G-AEKL was rebuilt twice, was fitted with three different engines and had a total of six paint schemes. Subsequently, the aircraft passed through several hands before being destroyed by German bombs at Lympne early in the war. =ZS-AHM/G-AEXF= ZS-AHM The Golden City, also an E2H, was built to the order of A.M. Miller for the Schlesinger Race and powered by a Gipsy Six Series II. Miller retired at the Belgrade checkpoint. Percival re-engined the aircraft with a Gipsy Six I and sold it to Bill Humble who registered it in the UK as G-AEXF. Humble never took delivery, instead swapping it with Alex Henshaw for his de Havilland Leopard Moth.Henshaw, Alex; The Flight of the Mew Gull, John Murray, 1980. Henshaw soon won the 1937 Folkestone Trophy with G-AEXF. The aircraft was extensively modified by Essex Aero and fitted with a scrapped Gipsy Six R engine from de Havilland DH.88 Comet G-ACSS, winner of the 1934 England-Australia air race. In this form it won the 1938 King's Cup. In February 1939, re-engined yet again with a Gipsy Six Series II and with revised equipment, it set a new mark for the out-and-home Cape class-record which stood until 2009. G-AEXF has been restored to flying condition, requiring an almost complete rebuild, more than once. Powered by a Gipsy Queen II, it is owned and operated by The Shuttleworth Collection, Old Warden and displays at airshows during the summer months. A Gipsy Six R is also on static display there. AJD Engineering (Ipswich, UK), who restored the original G-AEXF after a crash at Shuttleworth, were commissioned by the late Alex Henshaw to make a static replica, representing the Cape configuration of G-AEXF. The replica is on display at the RAF Museum Hendon. =ZS-AHO/G-AEMO= ZS-AHO was another E2H powered by a Gipsy Six Series II engine, built to the order of S.S. \\"Stan\\" Halse for the Schlesinger Race. Due to bad visibility, Halse made a forced landing in a ploughed field in Southern Rhodesia, where the aircraft flipped onto its back and was written off. At the time of the accident, Halse was well ahead of the rest of the field, so much so, that by the time Scott and Guthrie's winning Vega Gull arrived, most of the disappointed spectators had gone home. =G-AFAA= The one-off Type E.3H (the so-called \\"Super\\"-Mew ) was Edgar Percival's personal mount. While looking very much the same as the E2H, this was actually a completely new design, powered by a Gipsy Six Series II. It first flew in 1937 and was raced by Percival in 1937‚Äì1939. On loan for propeller trials at Hatfield during the war, G-AFAA was written off in a landing accident by a de Havilland pilot. The remains of this aircraft were burned with those of G-ACND at a Percival Aircraft garden fete at Luton Airport immediately after the war.

In 2008, the building was de-listed from the NRHP. History In 1853, the first Washington County Jail opened.Mandel, Michelle. A lockup to lure 'em in. The Oregonian, May 13, 2004. It was built at Fourth and Washington Streets in Hillsboro, Oregon by William Brown for a cost of $900. During its use, two people died while confined to the jail, and a baby was born after it ceased being used as a jail. One of those dying in the jail was former Hudson's Bay Company employee William Burris who killed his family in 1855 in a drunken rage. However, despite rumors, American Civil War General Ulysses S. Grant was not jailed here while he was posted to Oregon before the Civil War. In 1870, the building was sold to the Cave family. They lived in it briefly while their house was built, and then used the structure as an outbuilding. In 1953 the structure was moved to the Washington County Fairgrounds where it remained until 2003. Beginning in 2003, the building was restored at a cost of $75,000 and relocated from the county fairgrounds to the Washington County Museum. =Currently= In 1986, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Then in 2003 the building was disassembled and restored. Next, in 2004, the jail was re-assembled inside the Washington County Museum where it sat as a permanent exhibit, preserved in the climate controlled environment. On December 24, 2008, the jail was removed from NRHP after it was requested by the museum. In September 2008, the museum decided to move the jail outside, and in March 2009 the old log jail was relocated outside and became an outdoor exhibit on the grounds of the museum.

He wrote, \\"We urge the Legislature to revisit this statute and seriously reconsider the balance between public entity immunity and public safety. The balance appears to have shifted too far toward immunity and left public safety, as well as compensation for innocent victims, twisting in the wind.\\"http://www.kristieslaw.org/images/4th_appellate_ct.pdf  Aftermath = Senate Bill 719 = In 2005, Peace Officers Research Association of California (PORAC) sponsored California Senate Bill 719. \\"This bill would narrow the available immunity for public entities that employ peace officers when a third party is injured or killed in a collision with a person fleeing from peace officer pursuit.

The older of the two is the AGN-201M model, a low- power teaching reactor. The newer reactor, the TRIGA Mark I, is focused strongly towards research. AGN-201M This was the first reactor of the Nuclear Engineering program at Texas A&M;, built in the 1950s and licensed in August 26, 1957. It is going through system upgrades and is not operational for 2017. The reactor is of a negligible thermal power of 5 watts but achieves criticality, making it a critical assembly. The AGN-201M type reactor is also employed at University of New Mexico and another AGN-201 type is used at Idaho State University. TRIGA Mark I This is the main reactor of the NSC, operation began in 1961. Tours are available to the public and it is reported that around 2,000 students participate in a tour each year. In 1999 there were 2,982 visitors. The reactor is located in a stand-alone facility away from the Texas A&M; campus and close to an airfield. =Technical specifications= This reactor was part of the first line of TRIGA reactors but has a number of features that distinguishes it from the other dozens of TRIGA reactors in use today. It is a 1 megawatt pool-type reactor. It is designed for optimal irradiation of samples and is used to produce a number of radioisotopes for medical and industry applications. The reactor ran on 70% highly enriched uranium (HEU) until early 2006 when the core was refueled with low enriched uranium as a part of the National Nuclear Security Administration's (NNSA) Global Threat Reduction Initiative. This was a part of the Bush administration's efforts to minimize the terrorist threat posed by nuclear fuel in civilian applications around the world and constituted the first and only refueling of the reactor ever. In the decades that it had been in operation, the fuel had depleted its U-235 content from 70% to around 60%. The new fuel is somewhere under 20% enriched since it is classified as LEU.

He played with the Toronto Maple Leafs and New York Rangers of the National Hockey League (NHL) and won two Stanley Cups with the Leafs in 1949 and 1951. Not a prolific goal scorer, Juzda built a reputation as one of hockey's hardest hitters. Early years and pre-war NHL career Juzda began his hockey career in the Western Junior Hockey League with the Elmwood Maple Leafs and Kenora Thistles, helping the Thistles earn a trip to the Memorial Cup final in 1940. He was called up by the New York Rangers during the 1940-41 season but spent a good part of the year with their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Philadelphia Rockets. He appeared in 45 games with the Rangers during the 1941-42 season. Juzda put his National Hockey League career on hold when he volunteered for World War II service with the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). He maintained his connection with hockey by playing for the RCAF hockey team in the Winnipeg National Defense Hockey League (WNDHL). NHL career after World War II At the conclusion of the war, Juzda was discharged from military service and he returned to hockey full-time. He joined the New Haven Ramblers of the AHL and was re-signed by the New York Rangers in time for the 1946‚Äì47 NHL season. He appeared in another 137 games with the Rangers before being traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs in a multi-player deal before the 1947‚Äì48 NHL season.

Career after the NHL Juzda played for the Pittsburgh Hornets of the AHL in 1952 and earned an AHL 2nd team All-Star selection. In 1953 he returned to Winnipeg to play for the Winnipeg Maroons for ten seasons, making two Allan Cup final appearances. The Maroons toured Czechoslovakia where hockey veterans still refer to a bone-rattling body check as a \\"Juzda\\". In the mid-1950s Juzda had brief stops with the Brandon Wheat Kings and the Pine Falls Paper Kings. While Juzda officially retired from hockey after 1963, he played old-timers' hockey well into his seventies. Juzda coached hockey from levels midget to senior.

He was an ordained minister of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) from rural Tennessee. He was the director of the Craddock Center, a non-profit service group which operates in rural Appalachia. Written works Craddock has written a number of books, including The Pre-Existence of Christ (1968), As One Without Authority (1971, rev. 1974 and 1979), Overhearing the Gospel (1978), The Gospels (1981), commentaries on John (1982) and Philippians (1984), Preaching (1985), a commentary on Luke (1990) and a collection of sermon-related anecdotes (Craddock Stories. 2001). Craddock has also contributed articles to various journals.Day1 :: Speaker The Rev. Dr. Fred Craddock Preaching style There are at least three major features of Craddock's new homiletic that distinguish it from traditional homiletics. First, instead of using a traditional deductive approach, in which three points are named and illustrated, in his sermons, Craddock advocates an inductive style. Critiquing traditional homiletics‚Äîcalled the \\"old homiletic\\"‚ÄîCraddock turned toward induction, in which the preacher re-creates for the listener the inductive process of study used to create the sermon itself. A second unique feature of Craddock's new homiletic is that a sermon should seek to create an experience for the listener, rather than attempting to gain the listeners' assent through sermons using deductive, linear logic. As a result of Craddock's inductive model, the role of the listeners fundamentally changes: no longer are listeners passive recipients of a conclusion already reached by the authoritative preacher, to which they must acquiesce. Rather, in Craddock's scheme, the listeners are active participants in the sermon by virtue of the sermon form itself, which enables the hearer to \\"finish\\" the sermon that is intentionally left open- ended. A key assumption of this model, as Craddock notes, is that listeners share a common universal experience, ensuring that the listener's mental processes will work in the same way as the preacher's, thus recreating the same type of experience. This assumption would be later challenged by, among others, John McClure. Third, Craddock emphasizes that the form or genre of the biblical passage to be preached should shape in some way the form taken by the sermon (a claim also made by Tom Long). While Craddock does not require that a sermon slavishly adhere to the biblical form‚Äîa psalm need not be preached entirely as a poetic sermon‚Äîhe argues that various biblical forms seek to accomplish a variety of rhetorical aims; as such, the sermon should attempt to \\"do what the text does\\" in both the \\"what\\" (content) and the \\"how\\" (rhetorical strategies) of the text. :Craddock offers an inductive approach to preaching with an aim of active participation by the listener in the movement of the sermon as well as in the discerning of the message. His grounding principle is that good preaching is a socializing force that creates community.PEP Sept 2004 Often characterized as preaching with a style that is \\"folksy,\\" Craddock is known for using humour in sermons. Newsweek ranked him as one of America's greatest preachers. Craddock's new homiletic has influenced further generations of homileticians who have developed new sermon forms while holding to certain values found within the new homiletic: narrative preaching, phenomenological preaching, and conversational preaching, to name a few. Lectures Much sought after as a lecturer, he has delivered the Lyman Beecher Lectures at Yale, the Scott Lectures at Claremont School of Theology, the Adams Lectures at Southeastern Baptist Seminary, the Schaff Lectures at Pittsburgh Theological Seminary, the Sprinkle Lectures at Barton College (formerly Atlantic Christian College), the Cole Lectures at Vanderbilt, the Westervelt Lectures at Austin Presbyterian Seminary, the Mullins Lectures at Southern Seminary, and the Earl Lectures at Pacific School of Religion. He has served as invited plenary speaker at the Christian Scholars Conference. Craddock was the 2007 Founder's Day speaker at Johnson University, where he completed his undergraduate degree, and taught in the fields of Bible and Homiletics. Craddock was succeeded on the Emory faculty by Carl R. Holladay. Personal Craddock was born in 1928 to Fred, Sr. and Ethel Craddock. He had three brothers and a sister. Craddock married Nettie Dungan in June 1950, upon his graduation from Johnson Bible College. They had two children, John and Laura.

It runs from Highway 5 in Saskatoon to Highway 3/Highway 6 in Melfort. Highway 41 is about long. Hwy 41 ends the intersection with Hwy 5 Highway 41 also intersects Highway 2. Also along the route, it passes near the communities of Aberdeen and Wakaw. Route description=Communities= Hwy 41 approaching its western terminus with Hwy 5 The town of Aberdeen, population 550 is located about north east of Saskatoon. Aberdeen incorporated as a village in 1907. The small hamlet of Edenburg is northeast of Aberdeen. The village of Alvena has a population of about 55 residents. According to the 2006 census the One Arrow 95-1C Indian Reserve had a population of zero living on their land allotment. Wakaw is a town which began with the establishment of the Presbyterian Geneva Mission in 1903. In 1992, a memorial was erected in recognition of the Anna Turnbull Memorial Hospital and the Geneva Mission. Melfort, the City of Northern Lights is located in the Carrot River valley. The city was first named the Stoney Creek settlement which changed when the post office in the area was named. Melfort became a village in 1903, a town in 1907, and a city in 1980. The valley area with black loamy soil is prime agricultural lands. Located at Melfort is the Agriculture Melfort Research Station. =Rural municipalities= The rural municipality (RM) of Aberdeen No. 373 is outside of Corman Park 344 which circumnavigates the city of Saskatoon. The RM of Aberdeen was incorporated July 26, 1909. Since 1909 one township of the RM was annexed by the RM of Comran Park. Highway 41 and the Canadian National Railway (CNR) line both support transportation to Aberdeen. Agriculture is the main economy of the area which provides a base for Horizon Seed Processors, Louis Dreyfus High Throughput Grain Germinal and Hold On Industries. The main portion of RM Three Lakes No. 400 is south of Highway 41, The RM's name comes from Basin Lake, Lenore Lake and Middle Lake which are fully or partially within the RM area. LID #21-S-2 became Invergordon No. 430 and LID #221-R-2 is now Flett's Springs no. 430. In 1908 LID #21-S-2 paid to foremen in the area 22 cents per hour, a laborer received 20 cents per hour and a man with team received 40 cents an hour. An additional 25 cents per day were paid for use of plow when it was needed. In 1914, rates went up. A man with team received 50 cents an hour, a man or a team 25 cents an hour and 30 cents an hour for a foreman. Two slushers and scrapers could be ordered for each district, the quantity dependent upon roads and sloughs in the area. The rail survey began in 1929 and the Meskanaw bridge construction began. The Meskanaw station was opened around 1935 and passenger trains continued until 1977. Technology at this time allowed vehicles open roads through the winter months, and rails went into disuse. Flett's Springs is in a boreal transition ecoregion which has some features of aspen parkland and boreal forest vegetation. The Flett's Springs School was established as early as 1894. The community established the Local Improvement District (LID) NO. 21 and 22 in the area as the civic government. The LID changed names to Carrot River Municipality No. 429 in 1910. It wasn't until 1938 that the present land holdings and the name of RM of Flett's Spring's No. 419 was in effect. The area became a part of the Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities (SARM) at the same time. The RM office is housed in Melfort as of 1989, with the first offices being in Pathlow. =Major Attractions= Battle of Fish Creek The Fish Creek Historical Site commemorates Major General Frederick Middleton's camp. The actual Battle of Fish Creek occurred southeast of this camp. The Clarkboro Ferry crosses the South Saskatchewan River near the old ferry crossing which was named Clarke's Crossing. Clarke's Crossing was used by General Middleton's troops when travelling to the Fish Creek Battle en route from North Battleford. There is a marker on the Edenburg road which pays tribute to Clarke's Crossing Ferry service. Flett Creek and Goosehunting Creek both meander through the RM of Flett's Springs. To the north of Melfort is Wapiti Regional Park at Codette Lake. The City of Melfort provides a campground at the highway junction of Highway 3, the CanAm and Highway 41.

Life One of the twenty-one children of Jean-Jacques de Ligniville and his wife Charlotte de Saureau, Anne-Catherine de Ligniville, the niece of Madame de Graffigny, married the philosopher Helv√©tius in 1751. By the time he died twenty years later, the couple had amassed a vast fortune, and with it Madame Helvetius maintained her salon which featured the greatest figures of the Enlightenment for over five decades. Among the habitu√©s of Madame Helv√©tius's salon were Julie de Lespinasse and Suzanne Necker, writers Fontenelle, Diderot, Chamfort, Duclos, Saint-Lambert, Marmontel, Roucher, Saurin, Andr√© Ch√©nier, and Volney. Thinkers such as Condorcet, d'Holbach, Turgot, Abb√© Siey√®s, Abb√© Galiani, Destutt de Tracy, Abb√© Beccaria, Abb√© Morellet, Buffon, Condillac or Abb√© Raynal mingled with such scientists as d'Alembert, Lavoisier, Cuvier and Cabanis. The sculptor Houdon, Baron G√©rard and other leading figures of the time such as Charles-Joseph Panckoucke and Fran√ßois- Ambroise Didot were also attendees. Such politicians as Malesherbes, Talleyrand, Madame Roland and her husband Roland de la Plati√®re, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin (who is claimed to have proposed marriage to her),The legend goes that when she refused, out of devotion to her late husband, Franklin claimed he had visited Heaven in a dream and found Helvetius married there to Franklin's own deceased love, Deborah. \\"Come, let us revenge ourselves,\\" he said. This story is debunked in Claude-Adrien Helv√©tius, see refs. Mirabeau, Pierre Daunou, Garat, Nicolas Bergasse and Napol√©on Bonaparte could also be found at her salon. The salon also provided a steady home for a great clowder of Angora cats. The cats were a well-known feature of Madame Helvetius' salon, always bedecked with silk ribbons and doted on by their loving caregiver. Eighteen in all, the cats were kept company by the Madame's dogs, canaries, and many other pets. Madame Helv√©tius died at Auteuil. In popular culture Madame Helv√©tius appears in the 2008 television drama series John Adams, in which she is played by Judith Magre. Madame Helv√©tius is mentioned briefly in the Robert Lawson children's book Ben and Me (1939) as having many important people at her dinners, and also having cats (distressing to the protagonist, who is a mouse) and a particularly disagreeable dog.

She was among the first African-Americans admitted to the practice of law in the United States, was assistant attorney general in Ohio, served on numerous committees, executive positions, and consulted, for the Bah√° º√≠s, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the National Council of Negro Women, and was a president for the Delta Sigma Theta sorority. Born and raised Helen Elsie Austin's mother was Mary Louise Austin, n√©e Dotson, (sometimes Dodson) herself daughter of 1872 member of the Alabama House of Representatives, Rev. Mentor Dodson, who was listed as a teacher in the 1870 Census. Austin's father was George J. Austin, visible in later years being sensitive to issues of colorism as well as casual relationships and advocacy of women. Her parents married June 10, 1906, and both worked at the Tuskegee Institute - a fact Austin recalled that distinguished Mary Louse in the eyes of Booker T. and Mrs. Washington. At Tuskegee George served as Commandant of Men,Ohio History Central ¬ª History ¬ª People ¬ª Austin, Elsie with a history as a veteran of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. She was born at Tuskegee. The United States Social Security paperwork does indicate she was born in Washington DC however. The family was still at Tuskegee in 1910 according to the US Census,* however from at least 1912 George worked at the Prairie View Normal School in Austin, Texas, (which evolved over time into the Prairie View A&M; University,) again as Commandant of Men.* * However in the face of the break out of World War I George Austin spoke of enlistment, and himself sought to enlist for officer training at Citizens' Military Training Camp in New York, where he was denied for no technical reason other than the policy of the US War Department, and instead entered Fort Des Moines Provisional Army Officer Training School as a first lieutenant for training which ran June to October, 1917,* * and listed with the draft. He was later credited with serving with the 65th Machine Gun Company, which might be the UK unit of the same name. By January 1920 the family settled in Cincinnati, Ohio, though George was director of a civic league supported by the black community in Port Huron, Michigan, were said to have lived in West Virginia briefly before that, and then after Michigan George was director of a Civic Center supported by members of the white and black community in Zanesville.* * Mary Louise worked at Stowe School, named after Harriet Beecher Stowe. Austin is known to have interrupted a class in high school on an extended description of the contributions of Africans to civilization, correcting a textbook. She shared an oral history recording including the anecdote about her first day at Walnut High School:Walnut Hills is now a neighborhood of Cincinnati, Ohio.Front of Walnut Hills High School > (After a reading by the teacher from a textbook about the contributions by > all the races, but that the black race made no significant contribution and > had been created to be subservient to the more fortunate races.) Can you > imagine?

Austin graduated from Walnut Hills High School, in the suburb of Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1924. College, the Law, and Bah√° º√≠ Faith Following her aunt Jennie Charlotte Austin, class of 1911, in 1928 Austin and 7 other African American women students were admitted to University of Cincinnati, (UC). Historically there was limited attendance of blacks at the university - indeed the first known attendee was not even named in university records. The first significant rise in blacks admitted to the university came in the 1920s with most of those being women and limited to the college of education though that limit was increasingly dropped though there remained no black faculty and blacks could not live in the dormitories and had limited access to the university pool. Austin recalled she and the others they were brought into an administrator's office and warned to not be conspicuous, mind being members of a subject race, and to have low expectations. She reported an anecdote: > We were young, sensitive, full of hope and aspiration for university > education. That speech traumatized us. We sat down and discussed the > situation. And then all 8 of us decided that we were going out for > everything in the university. We almost took an oath in blood that we were > all to finish that first year with honors in something. By the end of the > year each one of us did take an honor. At the beginning of the next year > that same official who had called us in and insulted us, apologized for her > remarks. Despite this Austin did join an inter-racial club on campus, as well as the young chapter of Delta Sigma Theta though none of the black sororities or fraternities had their picture in school yearbooks until later. Austin received a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1930 from the University of Cincinnati, becoming the first black woman to graduate from the UC Law School, though her father did not live to see it, nor when she passed the Indiana Bar, as one of 22 black women lawyers by 1930 and one of the pioneers marked by Goler Teal Butcher. During the work of that degree Austin had taken a year to be on the staff of the Rocky Mountain Law Review and on return earned a place in the Cincinnati Law Review. She closed out her university work in April presenting Liberia in a mock League of Nations event on campus, a preview of some of her international efforts in later years. Austin's grandfather did live to see these achievements and died in October of that year. Austin was living back home with family,* * where Austin's mother was inspired to go back to college as well. In 1931 Austin had opened a law practice in Indianapolis, Indiana, and then in Ohio in 1933 where she co-founded a law firm with Henry J. Richardson Jr. and then presented about the work of the NAACP. About the same time Austin becomes visible as a member of the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority. But she was unquieted. > I was young, angry, incensed and hostile. I went to my father and told him I > was going to become an agnostic or an atheist because 'I just don't believe > anymore in these religions that are all separate, all fighting with each > other, all enforcing prejudice against some group, and yet they say God is > the father of all mankind.' My father heard me out, and then said 'Well > before you do it, why don't you go and talk to these Cincinnati people who > are talking about the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. He was not a Bah√° º√≠ but he said they > have some interesting views. The Bah√° º√≠s in Cincinnati date back at least to 1910. A joint meeting of Bah√° º√≠ communities of Ohio met in Cincinnati in June 1930, and was a time of monthly public meetings in Cincinnati. In 1931 a Cincinnatian member of the Urban League took part in one of the Race Amity conferences of the religion over in New York. There was a Bah√° º√≠ Spiritual Assembly, the local administrative institution of nine adults, in Cincinnati in 1933. Austin carried literature of the religion around for about two years and attended meetings noting especially prominent African-American and lawyer Louis G. Gregory, and Dorothy Baker over in Lima, who \\"helped me overcome my bitterness\\" and joined the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in 1934, the same year she also presented the NAACP protest of school allocations, was admitted to plead cases before the Ohio Supreme Court, and was named to the Board of Trustees of HBCU Wilberforce University.* * Austin led a private study class on the religion in 1935, and in 1936 served on an all-Cincinnati YWCA committee of whites and blacks that met at the African-American serving West End YWCA and a functional site for girls in the Y in Walnut Hills. Assistant attorney general In 1937 was a big year for Austin. The year opens being named an assistant attorney general for Ohio under Herbert S. Duffy which made news in a number of venues, still living at the address of her family. In March Austin received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from HBCU Wilberforce University because of her appointment. She continued her work in a variety of settings - YMCA in public society,* * joined a regional committee overseeing the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, and Kentucky, and presented at a symposium in Cleveland. Austin was soon also on a Bah√° º√≠ committee overseeing radio use by the religion, and by May was secretary of the Cincinnati branch of the NAACP and chair of legal committee of Colored Women Federated Clubs. She continued to be noted at speaking engagements and banquets* * while also named as a member of the state patrol board. The year closed with Austin elected secretary of Wilberforce University Board, elected to Board of the NAACP branch, and finally giving a talk for the NAACP in December. 1938 was similarly busy. In February she gave a talk for a civic club, and for a Bah√° º√≠ youth symposium at YWCA,* * as well as at Green Acre Bah√° º√≠ School. In April she spoke for the NAACP in Dayton, the for youth bar association in Ohio. Her father was remembered during Memorial Day services. Clarification of Austin was appointed was published, and about her status on the Wilderforce board appointment, and invited to present on a convention on the progress of African-Americans. Charles Mason Remey gave a talk on the Bah√° º√≠ Faith at the Austin family home in October, and was among the speakers invited on the one hand,* * * and being part of a Bah√° º√≠ symposium, and other religious meetings as well.* * As November closed Austin's continued position on the Wilberforce board was upheld,* * February 1939 opens with notice that Austin would serve on a committee interracial \\"good will\\" meeting, and presenting at a YWCA in March. In April Austin was among those attending a Kentucky Negro Educational Association conference in Louisville, and in May she was among the Cincinnati Bah√° º√≠s that went to the Bah√° º√≠ national convention along with mother Mary Louise and brother George Austin, Jr., returning for a birth shower. and finishing her term as assistant attorney general, through which she had not seen much work in trials. DC, Deltas, and Bah√° º√≠s She started serving on the national legal advisory committee for the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. By September she had moved to Washington, DC, doing legal work for several institutions and where she took on serving with Delta Sigma Theta.* * Indeed she was elected 8th president of the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority. She also contributed to a Phi Beta Sigma national essay contest, and more meetings. She was a legal advisor to the District of Columbia government in 1939 and then advised the Office of Price Administration and the National Labor Relations Board and the DC Recorder of Deeds Office. Now in less public circumstances, Austin addressed the Bah√° º√≠ national convention of the spring of 1940, and the 1940 US Census marked the monthly income for each mother and daughter earning circa $2400 recorded in Cincinnati \\\\- about $42k in 2018 dollars. 1941 opens with Austin among a free legal aid bureau of the National Bar Association in January, and contributing a youth class at Louhelen Bah√° º√≠ School in Michigan in July,* * Austin was among first 58 women lawyers in US and presently a lawyer for DC Recorder of Deeds, and became the 3rd black woman to teach law in US when she taught at the Robert H. Terrell Law School circa 1941. Continuing her work for the Deltas she presented a ‚ÄúJobs analysis and opportunities project‚Äù(aka OPA) at Delta meeting in 1941. In November she also joined the Maryland, Virginia and DC Regional Teaching Committee responsible for overseeing efforts to promulgate the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in that area. The year closed out for Austin with a Christmas Delta's meeting in Detroit. Commentary on social engagements followed her in 1942, but she also presented the Bah√° º√≠ teachings during a national meeting marking the anniversary of the founding of the religion, while continuing her service on the national legal advisory committee of the religion.* * There was comment that Austin worked, like Louis Gregory on travels in the South for the religion as well. In December Austin was mentioned as Delta President among those about the OPA program. Dwindling coverage shows Austin among the speakers at a Missouri Deltas meeting, and a freshman orientation (though the coverage didn't say where,) while in September Austin was back at Green Acre. In 1944 Austin was featured during the observance of the centenary of the foundational Bah√° º√≠ holy day, the Declaration of the B√°b, in a radio interview that was broadcast, and the work of the Race Unity national committee of the Bah√° º√≠s also underscored her work. Though the dates are unknown, Claude Albert Barnett, founder of the Associated Negro Press in 1919, corresponded with Austin. National Spiritual Assembly of the Bah√° º√≠s of the United States In the balloting of the 1945 national Bah√° º√≠ convention Austin had held the leading position outside of the final members elected. At the June anniversary of the visit of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, then leader of the religion, to New Jersey, Austin's contribution was a talk \\"Bases for a durable peace\\" in the face of the ongoing WWII which interrupted the international plans of the religion. Austin and fellow Bah√° º√≠ Marzieh Gail were at Louhelen Baha ºi School in the summer of 1945, and it was noted Austin's term as president of the Deltas was over. Austin then appeared at Green Acre Bah√° º√≠ School again, and served on the DC Bah√° º√≠ regional convention committee for electing delegates to the national convention. Amidst a national campaign of meetings for the religion, Austin was among those making an appearance in Boston, and then in Pittsburgh in a contrasting tone to that elsewhere in the black community, though the Bah√° º√≠s were \\"electrified\\", February ended noting her talk in Cincinnati \\"Security for a fearful world\\". Near the close of the 1945-6 term of the National Assembly of the Bah√° º√≠s of the United States and Canada Roy Wilhelm resigned for reasons of health and the delegates for the year elected Austin as replacement in a by-election with her taking office in March, 1946, with more than twice that of the next vote-getter. Her term in office overlapped that of Louis G. Gregory the remainder of that year. In May Austin appeared at the opening of an artist exhibit in DC, and was elected to the national assembly again in 1946, which also saw the launch of the Second Seven-Year Plan by Shoghi Effendi, then head of the religion, calling for the completion of the interior ornamentation and landscaping of the Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship in Wilmette, the establishment of National Spiritual Assemblies in South America, Central America, and Canada; and the reestablishment of the religion in Europe. In July Austin was part of a regional Bah√° º√≠ conference including a race unity round table in July, and a series of meetings were held at the HBCU Hampton Institute in July including talks by Austin, followed by an early November appearance in Urbana, Illinois, for the Bah√° º√≠s at which some 800 attended and was broadcast over local radio. Austin spoke before a larger group in Baltimore in late January, and a small group in Atlanta in February. February also was when Austin was a delegate to the International Council of Women conference called by the United Nations Department of Information at Lake Success, NY,* * following which Austin was visible giving Bah√° º√≠ talk over in Los Angeles in later March, and then back to Atlanta to a larger meeting. The Atlanta community had had some race incidents with the KKK and affiliated groups in April and began to seek a Center that would be safe. Approaching mid-April Austin was among the honorees of past Delta presidents, while the Cincinnati Bah√° º√≠s elected an assembly with mother Mary L. Austin and brother George Austin, while the national convention included consultation about KKK raids in the South and the terrorism of blacks with Austin commenting \\"We must formally protest such actions to the authorities; mixed religious groups are meeting in the South today\\". Austin was elected to the national assembly again.* * In January 1948 Austin gave a talk for the Bah√° º√≠s in Dayton, Ohio,* * * with the Bah√° º√≠ community thankful for the newspaper coverage. It was also noted she was chairman of the legal committee for the National Council for Colored Women, (NCNW). She was in Cincinnati in February, and then a symposium on women and the United Nations in March. The goal of Canada forming its own national Bah√° º√≠ assembly was achieved and Austin attended their first Canadian national convention, and co-presented during a 2 hour public meeting there. Austin was again elected to the US national assembly, spoke at the public meeting during that session and at the convention Austin and Borrah Kavelin held and presented on a workshop \\"Education to remove prejudice\\" for attendees of the convention. In October Austin was at a National Council of Negro Women meeting at the White House saying a Bah√° º√≠ prayer, and was visible at a \\"One world concert\\" held in DC. In January 1959 National Freedom Day was held in Philadelphia and Austin was a speaker, during which she made comments of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° visiting, and in March Austin was among the NAACP effort at the Capital. In April it was announced Austin was on the National Programming Committee coordinating and producing all types of materials for the promotion of the religion, and was elected to the national assembly.* * A reception for Austin was held by a chapter of the Deltas in Georgia in May, and it was mentioned Austin was on the National Labor Relations Board in June. Consultation for the Bah√° º√≠ national convention included the virtues needed and encouraged including comments by Austin. Indeed the second recommendation at the convention was that Austin's workshops and comments on consultation be published. The national assembly organization was established as a Trust with Austin among the trustees.* * and in November Austin was visible in DC black society. In 1950 volume 10 of The Bah√° º√≠ World reviewed the centenary observance and included Austin's roll, and was part of the report of the national assembly to the community. Austin was among many at a select reception in South Carolina for Julius Waties Waring at the end of March. General comment on the broad Bah√° º√≠ growth in the country and the national assembly election mentioned Austin in Hawaii,* * The Bah√° º√≠s observed the centenary of the execution of the B√°b in July with a panel presided over by Austin. In September Austin gave a talk at Women's Day at a church in Cincinnati. In 1952 Austin's article \\"World Unity as a way of life\\" was included in volume 11 of The Bah√° º√≠ World. In it she states: > The achievement of effective understanding and cooperation among the diverse > nations, races, and classes of mankind is the chief essential for the > survival of civilization. This urgent need is only partially fulfilled by > the political, social, and economic theories proffered today. The great and > powerful religions emphasize this need in their proclamations, but their > practical programs have barely touched the issues involved.‚Ä¶ Even as the > love of God gives a man new values with which to measure other men and his > relationship with them, it also gives him a deeper regard for the law and > order which are the basis for any progressive society. Loyalty to spiritual > principle and conscientious use of it in human affairs is the beginning of > social order and security. The spiritual laws of God give man his great > ethical standards. Belief in God and sincere effort to live one's faith are > the generative forces of man's conscience. When human conscience and social > ethics are united in their objectives there is cooperation between inner and > outer disciplines. The result is a matured and refined individual and > society. Late in August the Louhelen School youth program was held with an Austin led class \\"Divine Art of Living\\".* * The 1951 election returned Austin to the national assembly, and she was chair of the Africa committee which reported to the convention on progress of the religion there as well as seeking more connections. In September mother Mary Louise Austin died while visiting Austin; burial was at Colored American Cemetery, in Oakley, Ohio.* * In October the first coordinated pioneers moving to promote the religion were arriving in Africa. The 1952 national Bah√° º√≠ convention elected Austin though spreading information of it was delayed. Austin's work on the African committee focused on job opportunities. In June Austin contributed to the \\"Souvenir Unity Feast\\" for the religion in New Jersey. In November Louis G. Gregory died and Austin was among the many who spoke at the memorial service. Austin was requested to compile a memorial article on Gregory. Pioneer and Knight of Bah√° ºu'll√°h to Morocco As 1953 opened with the news of the Bah√° º√≠ Ten Year Crusade, a program to expand the presence of the religion especially in Africa. Austin was a member of the United States International Teaching Committee reporting on progress started previously, followed by appearing at a World Religion Day observance in Wilmington, Delaware, with coverage by WDEL- TV as it was then called. In February the Bah√° º√≠s held a conference in Uganda including Austin,* * * as a representative of the US National Bah√° º√≠ Assembly. Austin undertook her Bah√° º√≠ pilgrimage. American newspaper coverage of Austin's travels to Africa and Europe mentioned her in March, while she returned in April to Cincinnati marking the centenary year of the declaration at Ridv√°n of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, founder of the religion, and the dedication of the House of Worship in Chicago.* * * Austin returned to Cincinnati again in June, chair of the African Committee by September, and into September Austin herself resigned to pioneer to promote the religion requiring another by- election. Ultimately five members resigned to move over seas to promote the religion - Elsie Austin, Dorothy Baker, Matthew Bullock, W. Kenneth Christian and Mamie Seto - and they were replaced by Lawrence Hautz, Charles Wolcott, Charlotte Linfoot, Robert McLaughlin and Margery McCormick. Austin moved to what was then called the Morocco International Zone centered on Tangier, credited with arriving October 23, 1953, for which she was ultimately named a Knight of Bah√° ºu'll√°h. She was named a teacher at the American School of Tangier, during which time she also helped establish Bah√° º√≠ communities in northern and western Africa. She still managed to make the news back in the States early,* * and later 1954\\\\. She was appointed as one of the first members of the Auxiliary Board for Africa,* * assisting Musa Ban√°n√≠. In 1955 Austin wrote the 18 page booklet Above All Barriers: The Story of Louis G. Gregory which was reprinted in 1964, 1965, 1969, and 1976. Austin wrote of the need for virtues amidst the challenges of pioneering where \\"all the world's prejucides are on parade\\". A regional national assembly for north-west Africa was elected by the Bah√° º√≠s in 1956 where Austin and Enoch Olinga served as officers of the convention and Austin serving then as chair of the national assembly. She was elected, and chair, again in 1957. Stateside Austin returned to the States again in August 1957 and gave a talk in Hackensack, New Jersey, though she expected to return soon.

In October Austin spoke in Chester, Pennsylvania, for a regional meeting of Bah√° º√≠s. In November Austin served through the NCNW as it organized exhibits of African-American women at the 35th Women's International Exposition. In May 1959 Austin continued her work with NCNW for a regional convention in New York. Circa June NCNW had a conference giving awards, announcing studies and newspaper coverage mentioned her comment that \\"inter- racial participation in the conference inspired a hope for a changed attitude toward minority groups in the South.\\" Austin also presided at a meeting on the evening of the centenary of the execution of the B√°b.* * In late May Austin attended a leadership NCNW meeting in Daytona, Florida, directly before going in June to St. Petersburg, and gave a talk for the Bah√° º√≠s as part of observing Race Unity Day.* * * In October Austin was back as executive director for NCNW presenting at a meeting in DC.

In 1906, the theatre became known as the Holborn Empire. History=Early years= The theatre was constructed on the site of the Six Cans and Punch Bowl Tavern. Edward Weston, nephew of the previous licensee of the pub, bought the former Holborn National Schoolrooms immediately behind the pub and rebuilt it as a music hall in six months. Morning Advertiser, 27 March and 6 November 1857 This purpose built hall was his response to the success of Charles Morton's Canterbury Music Hall in Lambeth. In 1861, Morton struck back by opening the Oxford Music Hall, nearby in Oxford Street; a development Weston opposed on the grounds there were already too many music halls in the area.Weston's Music Hall, at Arthur Lloyd music hall history 31 Mar 2007 The theatre was rebuilt in 1887 and renamed the Royal Music-Hall, its chairman then being W. B. Fair. It then changed names again in 1892, becoming the Royal Holborn Theatre of Varieties. So successful was it in that decade it began to rival Morton's Canterbury Theatre, which was the most popular and profitable in London. The hall's early and most influential years were presided over by an exacting chairman and master of ceremonies, W. B. Fair, famous for the song Tommy, Make Room for Your Uncle. He chose the acts, warmed the audience up for each succeeding performance, and encouraged them at all times to interact with the performers throughout the evening. Fair was thus responsible for introducing to the London stage some of the most famous music hall acts, including Bessie Bellwood and JH Stead.British Library on Weston's accessed 31 Mar 2007 The theatre became moribund at the beginning of the 20th century, but was rescued by George Cray, with sketches such as The Fighting Parson. =Holborn Empire= In 1905 the theatre was bought by the variety impresario Walter Gibbons and in 1906 he had the theatre auditorium remodelled by Frank Matcham at a cost of ¬£30,000; the theatre was renamed the Holborn Empire.Theatre Collection at the University of Kent accessed 13 Oct 2007 The Holborn Empire was the last surviving variety theatre in the West End,Museum of London accessed 31 Mar 2007 also performing special theatrical matinees. 1907 poster from the Music Hall War between artists and theatre managers On 22 January 1907, a long brewing dispute between artists, stage hands and managers of the theatres came to a head at the Holborn Empire. The artists, musicians and stage hands went on strike. Strikes in other London and suburban halls followed, organised by the Variety Artistes' Federation. The strike came to be known as the Music Hall Wars, and was against the conditions imposed by the managers. These included sole rights to a star and the ability to include additional matinee performances in the schedule without pay, or notice. Eventually the managements were forced to give in, in the face of solidarity by major stars like Marie Lloyd, and additional payments for matinee performances were introduced.Music Hall Strike of 1907 (Theatre Museum London) accessed 15 Nov 2007 The theatre premi√®red the first full-length feature film in 1914, The World, the Flesh and the Devil, a 50-minute melodrama filmed in Kinemacolour.

In the circulatory system of animals, a portal venous system occurs when a capillary bed pools into another capillary bed through veins, without first going through the heart. Both capillary beds and the blood vessels that connect them are considered part of the portal venous system. They are relatively uncommon as the majority of capillary beds drain into veins which then drain into the heart, not into another capillary bed. Portal venous systems are considered venous because the blood vessels that join the two capillary beds are either veins or venules. Examples of such systems include the hepatic portal system, the hypophyseal portal system, and (in non-mammals) the renal portal system. Unqualified, portal venous system often refers to the hepatic portal system. For this reason, portal vein most commonly refers to the hepatic portal vein. The functional significance of such a system is that it transports products of one region directly to another region in relatively high concentrations. If the heart were involved in the blood circulation between those two regions, those products would be spread around the rest of the body. In humans The human hepatic portal system delivers about three- fourths of the blood going to the liver. The final common pathway for transport of venous blood from spleen, pancreas, gallbladder and the abdominal portion of the gastrointestinal tract (with the exception of the inferior part of the anal canal and sigmoid colon) is through the hepatic portal vein. This portal vein is formed by the union of the superior mesenteric vein and the splenic vein posterior to the neck of the pancreas at the level of vertebral body L1. Ascending towards the liver, the portal vein passes posterior to the superior part of the duodenum and enters the right margin of the lesser omentum. It is anterior to the omental foramen and posterior to both the bile duct, which is slightly to the right, and the hepatic artery proper, which is slightly to the left. On approaching the liver, the portal vein divides into right and left branches which enter the liver parenchyma. It gives off the right and left gastric veins, the cystic vein and the para- umbilical veins as tributaries. There is another human portal venous system, the hypophyseal portal system, which transports hormones from the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland.

Architecture The proscenium and stage of the United Palace; the stage is set up for an orchestral performance A look at the inside of what has been called a \\"delirious masterpiece\\" The architectural style of the terra-cotta-faced theater has been described as \\"Byzantine-Romanesque-Indo-Hindu-Sino-Moorish- Persian-Eclectic-Rococo-Deco\\" by David W. Dunlap of the New York Times, who wrote later that Lamb borrowed from \\"the Alhambra in Spain, the Kailasa rock- cut shrine in India, and the Wat Phra Keo temple in Thailand, adding Buddhas, bodhisattvas, elephants, and honeycomb stonework in an Islamic pattern known as muqarnas.\\" The AIA Guide to New York City calls it \\"Cambodian neo- Classical\\" and invites a comparison to Lamb's Loew's Pitkin Theatre in Brownsville, Brooklyn, while New York Times reporter Nathaniel Adams called it simply a \\"kitchen-sink masterpiece.\\" Lamb himself wrote that \\"Exotic ornaments, colors and scenes are particularly effective in creating an atmosphere in which the mind is free to frolic and becomes receptive to entertainment.\\" The interior of the building features a \\"palatial\\" staircase. and reflects the western obsession with exotic lands and cultures that was fashionable in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The interior is decorated with filigreed walls and ceilings, illuminated with indirect, recessed lighting from within and behind the walls. The rich decor is enhanced by reproductions of authentic Louis XV and XVI furnishings. The theater still looks very much as it did when it first opened; the only major change that Rev. Ike made was adding in the 1970s a cuppola or prayer tower on the building's northeast corner, at Wadsworth Avenue and West 176th Street, topped by a \\"Miracle Star of Faith,\\" visible from the George Washington Bridge and New Jersey. In early 2017 the building exterior was nominated for city Landmark status. The owners opposed the Landmark designation citing the added cost and time to do any work on the building, use restrictions, and their fifty-year history of preserving the theater entirely with private funds. History Loews 175th Street Theatre was built as one of the Loew's Wonder Theatres, the company's five extravagant and spacious flagships throughout the New York City area. The other four theaters are Loew's Jersey in Jersey City (1929) and Loew's Kings in Brooklyn (1929), both now used as performing arts centers;Kings Theatre website and Loew's Paradise in the Bronx (1929) and Loew's Valencia in Queens (1929), both now used as churches. All five theaters featured identical \\"Wonder Morton\\" theatre pipe organs manufactured by the Robert Morton Organ Company of Van Nuys, California. Each organ featured a four-manual console and 23 ranks of pipes. The organ in the United Palace was restored c.1970 after almost 25 years of disuse, and was utilized by the church in its services. It remains in the theater but is not currently functioning due to water damage. Events featuring \\"Live Organ\\" accompaniment used an electronic organ. In October 2016 the New York Theater Organ Society began a full restoration of the organ which is one of the few surviving instruments that are still in their original venues. Loew's 175th Street Theatre seated over 3,400 people and opened on February 22, 1930. The first program included the MGM film Their Own Desire. starring Norma Shearer, and Pearls, a live musical stage revue starring vaudevillians Shaw and Lee (Al Shaw and Sam Lee). Hollywood stars who appeared at the theatre to host films included Joan Crawford, Judy Garland, Eleanor Powell,and Roy Rogers and Dale Evans. Loew's closed the theater in March 1969, 39 years after it opened, with a showing of 2001: A Space Odyssey. =Church= In 1969, as the era of grand movie palaces was coming to an end, the theatre was purchased by the United Christian Evangelistic Association, headed by televangelist Rev. Ike, who renamed the building the United Palace. The church has since become an all- inclusive, non-denominational spiritual arts community.

In 2007, Sir Simon Rattle appeared at the theater conducting the Berlin Philharmonic in Igor Stravinsky's ballet The Rite of Spring danced by public school students and choreographed by Royston Maldoom. The following year, a performance of Leonard Bernstein's Mass was given as part of the celebration of the 90th anniversary of that composer's birth. In addition, recitals, classes and lectures have also been presented at the theatre. The non-profit United Palace of Cultural Arts (UPCA) was founded by Reverend Ike's son Xavier Eikerenkoetter in 2012 and functions as a community arts center. UPCA currently works to produce performances for youth arts organizations through grants and fundraisers.United Palace of Cultural Arts website In 2013, local benefactor Lin-Manuel Miranda launched successful campaigns to raise money for a new 52-foot screen and digital projection system in the theatre. The monthly film series that followed pairs classic titles with live pre-show entertainment, in an effort to \\"reinvent going to the movies\\" as audiences experienced in the golden age of Hollywood. The first film presented in the new format was the 1941 Warner Bros classic Casablanca. On April 7, 2019, the United Palace of Spiritual Arts celebrated its 50th anniversary as occupant and operator of the venue with a special screening of the sci-fi classic 2001: A Space Odyssey (the last movie shown at Loew's 175th before it closed as a commercial movie house in 1969). The special event included a live guest appearance by star Keir Dullea. After the screening, a special ceremony featured Dullea in an on-stage Q&A; session with UPSA Board Chairperson Dr. Jean Houston, followed by a musical performance with inspirational singer/songwriter Karen Drucker. The festivities concluded with an after party on stage (with ticket proceeds benefiting UPSA's \\"Movies at the Palace\\" program). =Film and TV shoot location= The United Palace has served as a location in film and television, including the NBC TV series Smash, the Netflix series Luke Cage episode \\"Blowin' Up the Spot\\", and the HBO series Crashing episode 2.4 \\"Porter Got HBO\\".

Biography Townshend was the elder son of George Townshend, 16th Baron Ferrers of Chartley and 8th Baron Compton, by his wife Charlotte Ellerker. His father was the eldest son of George Townshend, 4th Viscount Townshend (he had inherited his two baronies from his mother in 1770) and was created Earl of Leicester in 1784, at which point Townshend adopted the courtesy title Lord Ferrers of Chartley. His grandfather was created Marquess Townshend in 1787, and his father inherited this title in 1807, at which point Townshend adopted the courtesy title Earl of Leicester. He succeeded his father as 3rd Marquess Townshend in 1811. Townshend was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge. =Marriage and scandal= In 1807, Leicester (as he was then known) married Sarah, daughter and heiress of William Dunn Gardner. They had no children and Sarah left him only a year later, after accusing him both of being impotent and of having homosexual relations with his Italian secretary. She sued for annulment in the ecclesiastical courts, but very shortly afterwards, she eloped with another man. Thus, the marriage was never dissolved although she committed adultery by entering into a bigamous marriage. Following this scandal, Leicester was disinherited by his father for bringing disgrace to the family (although this act could not affect the descent of peerages, and he remained the heir to his father's title and retained his own courtesy title), and lived mainly abroad thereafter. In 1809, shortly after abandoning her husband, Sarah went through a (legally invalid) ceremony of marriage with John Margetts, a brewer from St. Ives. The ceremony was held at Gretna Green. They had several children who bore their biological father's name until 1823. In that year, Sarah conveniently decided that the children should bear the surname of her legal husband, which they proceeded to do. The strictly legal position was that since Sarah's marriage had never been annulled, any children she bore would be deemed the progeny of her husband and ipso facto eligible to succeed him in his estates and titles. With this in mind, the eldest son John (20 July 1811 - 11 January 1903) was baptised with the surname Townshend and assumed the courtesy title of \\"Earl of Leicester\\". He was later to represent Bodmin in the House of Commons. Alarmed at the pretensions of Sarah and her children, Townshend's younger brother Lord Charles Townshend (who would inherit if Townshend had no legitimate sons) petitioned in May 1842 to have Sarah's children delegitimated. Townshend supported the petition, and all the children were duly declared illegitimate by Act of Parliament in 1842.Francois Velde (2007) \\"Genetically Challenged\\" Queen message from alt.talk.royalty, posted 30 May 2007. The message says in part: > \\"The Townshend peerage case was one where marquis Townshend (then called > Lord Chartley) married Sarah Dunn Gardner in 1807; a year later she left her > husband, sued in Ecclesiastical court to have the marriage annulled because > of his impotence but dropped the suit and eloped with a brewer of St. Ives. > Their children initially bore the brewer's name (Margetts) but from 1823 > took the name Townshend, and one took the style of Earl of Leicester.

There was much debate (how could you > bastardize the children of a valid and continuing marriage? Was the royal > prerogative not infringed? What about ordinary courts?). In the end the bill > received royal assent on July 12, 1843 entitled \\"An Act to declare that > certain persons therein mentioned are not children of the Most Honourable > George Ferrars, Marquis Townshend\\" (6 & 7 Vict c. 35) and declaring that > \\"the said several children of the said Sarah Gardner, Marchioness Townshend, > hereinbefore respectively mentioned, are not nor were, nor shall they or any > of them, be taken to be or be deemed the lawful issue of the said George > Ferrars Marquis Townshend\\" (According to Francois Velde, one child, being a > minor and having no legal guardian, was exempted from the act's provisions). > (Based on Frederick Clifford, A History of Private Bill Legislation, 1885, > vol. 1 p. 443-450).\\" Sarah died on 11 September 1858.Ibid. In 1843, after the Act of Parliament declaring him illegitimate was passed, the eldest son assumed his mother's maiden surname of Dunn Gardner. Later years Townshend died in Genoa in December 1855, aged 77. His only brother Charles, the petitioner in the legitimacy case, had predeceased him and left no sons either. Therefore, the Earldom of Leicester became extinct, while the baronies of Ferrers of Chartley and Compton fell into abeyance between his nephew (his middle sister's son) and his youngest sister; it has remained in abeyance. He was succeeded in the Marquessate of Townshend by his first cousin, John Townshend.

The organization operates under the sponsorship of the Conference of the Franciscan Family (CFF) and serves all members of the Franciscan family, as well as the global community by bringing spiritual, ethical, and Franciscan values to the United Nations and international organizations\\". The organization has headquarters in New York City, Geneva, and Bangkok. FI closely follows the tradition of Saint Francis and Saint Clare, attempting to put Franciscan ideals into practice at the international level. The organization is guided by the Saints' proclaimed concern for the poor, care of creation, and peacemaking. Franciscans around the world run schools, hospitals, Justice and Peace offices, shelters, and specialise in many services for the poor. The programmes at FI bring grassroots Franciscans to the United Nations forums in New York and Geneva, influencing international human rights standards and bringing witness to human rights violations. Franciscans International is supported by the freewill offerings of Franciscan communities and their partners. A large part of the organization's funding comes from individuals who support Franciscan work for human rights, care for creation, and peacemaking. FI's advocacy programmes are designed in response to Franciscan needs worldwide.  Vision statement  Vision: A global community built on Franciscan values, in which the dignity of every person is respected; resources are shared equitably; the environment is sustained; and nations and peoples live in peace. Mission: We are a Franciscan voice at the United Nations protecting the vulnerable, the forgotten, and our wounded earth. Advocacy Focus: The ministry of Franciscans International at the United Nations flows from its Vision. Our priority areas are: Extreme poverty, Environment, Peace-building. FI addresses these issues from an integrated rights-based approach. To do this FI uses the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) as the primary mechanism for advocacy work at the UN. As part of the UPR process, FI solicits issues of concern from Franciscans working at the grassroots, voices these concerns at the UN, and reports back to the Franciscan Family on progress made at the UN, who then in turn monitor these developments at the national level. FI further supports the Franciscan Family with issue and country-specific workshops relevant to these issues.

Named for former Markham mayor Don Cousens in April 2007, the route initially travelled northward from Copper Creek Drive in Box Grove, south of Highway 407, to Major Mackenzie Drive (York Regional Road 25). A southern extension to Steeles Avenue was later completed and the name Donald Cousens Parkway applied along the extension to Ninth Line. In addition to its role of funneling through- traffic around downtown Markham, the route serves as a boundary to residential development as land to the north and east are part of the protected Rouge National Urban Park and southwest limits of the planned Pickering Airport. Construction of the route began in 2002 north of 16th Avenue. In 2004, an interchange with Highway 407 was constructed along with a connection north to Highway 7\\\\. Both segments and the interchange were opened by December of that year. The following year, construction began to connect these two segments as well as on the Box Grove Bypass along Ninth Line; the former opened in October 2006 and the latter in the spring of 2007. Construction of the most recently opened segment, connecting the Box Grove Bypass to the interchange with Highway 407, began in 2009. It opened after several delays in 2012 and included a realignment of 14th Avenue. Donald Cousens Parkway and a planned connection with Morningside Avenue in Toronto form an \\"East Metro Transportation Corridor\\", originally envisioned by the province in the 1970s as a six lane municipal expressway. During the mid-1990s, the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) conducted studies and identified the need for the corridor by 2011. Although York Region had intended for a continuous alignment, the City of Toronto government opposed the direct connection between Morningside and Donald Cousens Parkway. As a result, it is now proposed to connect Morningside Avenue and Donald Cousens Parkway via a widened Steeles Avenue. However, no timeline has been announced as of 2015.  Route description  Donald Cousens Parkway is intended to relieve north-south traffic congestion on York Regional Road 68 (Main Street, former Highway 48) and York Regional Road 69 (Ninth Line), with signage suggesting drivers use the parkway as a through route past Markham. As trucks are prohibited along Main Street, signage guides them onto the parkway. The road begins north of Steeles Avenue East, which serves as the boundary between Markham and Toronto. A two-laned Ninth Line curves northeast after crossing and being crossed by two separate railway tracks (the Canadian Pacific (CP) Havelock Subdivision and the Canadian National (CN) York Subdivision) and becomes Donald Cousens Parkway, expanding to four lanes and travelling along the eastern fringe of the community of Box Grove, alongside which it was built in the mid-2000s. On the west side is a new residential subdivision, while on the east side beyond the CP Havelock subdivision, which the road parallels, is the completely undeveloped Bob Hunter Memorial Park. After passing Box Grove Bypass, where for some time the route ended, the road also becomes known as Box Grove Collector Road (BGCR). The route intersects 14th Avenue (York Regional Road 71) and continues as before, eventually curving north and meeting Copper Creek Drive while departing from the railway tracks and park. It passes a supercenter before an interchange with Highway 407, where it crosses over the toll route. No longer known by the BGCR name, the route meanders north, slowly edging east towards Reesor Road and now surrounded by undeveloped greenspace. It encounters Highway 7, north of which it becomes a divided roadway travelling on the eastern edge of Cornell as well as parallel to and alongside Reesor Road. Approaching and intersecting 16th Avenue, the road makes a broad sweeping curve northwest, continuing to serve as the boundary of urban development in Markham. It narrows to a two lane road, with adjacent land along the northern side prepared for future northbound lanes, before encountering Ninth Line again. Quickly curving north then east, sandwiched between the neighbourhood of Greenborough and Little Rouge Creek, the route makes a final curve north to end at Major Mackenzie Drive on the northern edge of urban development in eastern Markham. A future extension, will carry Donald Cousens Parkway north, crossing over the Stouffville GO Train line on a new bridge and merging into the current southern terminus of Highway 48. As a result of this, Highway 48 and Donald Cousens Parkway (York Regional Road 48) will become the through route while Main Street will meet them at an intersection demarcating the two.  History = Planning = The history of Donald Cousens Parkway dates back to the 1970s when Metropolitan Toronto and the Ontario Department of Highways, (now the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario or MTO) planned out the East Metro Transportation Corridor. This corridor was originally envisioned as a six-lane expressway connecting Highway 401 with the planned but unbuilt Highway 407 to service the future towns of Cornell and Seaton using the greenspace between the two. However, the drive for expressway construction faded through the 1970s and 1980s as a result of opposition and the resulting cancellation of the Toronto expressway network. Studies nonetheless continued to be performed confirming the need for the route. The formation of Rouge Park in 1990 resulted in a commitment for \\"no new roads\\" through the park south of Steeles Avenue, ending the potential for any expressway proposals to be approved. During 1994 and 1995, the MTO conducted two studies termed the Morningside Transportation Corridor Review. While the study once again confirmed the need for the route, it also suggested that while an expressway was the ideal solution, an arterial road would be the practical solution. It also suggested that the road be a municipal route, rather than a provincial one. In 1997, the Environmental Assessment for the Markham Bypass extension was completed, approving construction of an interchange at the future Ontario Highway 407 (then open only as far as Ontario Highway 404) and a divided roadway north from there to Major Mackenzie Drive. = Construction = Construction on the two lane section between 16th Avenue and Major Mackenzie Drive, connecting with the north end of the Old Markham Bypass, began in 2002, and was completed by the end of 2004. Phase 2, which included construction of a partial interchange with Highway 407, began in 2004 and was completed by the end of the year; it and the four lane section north of it to Highway 7 opened on December 17, 2004. In 2005, construction began on the third phase of the bypass, connecting the southern segment at Highway 7 with the northern segment north of 16th Avenue. This four lane section opened on October 24, 2006. The two lane road between this new section and 16th Avenue was subsequently closed and removed. Phase 1 cost an estimated $19.3 million; phase 2 an estimated $5.5 million; phase 3 an estimated $10.8 million. On October 19, 2006, York Regional Council voted to rename the Markham Bypass to honour the work of mayor Don Cousens. Following this decision, a report was prepared outlining the costs; it was presented to council on February 22, 2007, and a bylaw enacted. The name change became effective April 1, 2007. South of Highway 407, planning for the controversial link to Morningside Avenue has been underway since 2002. Although York had intended for Donald Cousens Parkway to tie directly into Morningside, thus completing and arterial link the Highway 401, Toronto has firmly opposed this direct link since 2005 due to the requirement for a new crossing of the Rouge River. After a lengthy and contentious debate between the two, the province brought in former York Region CAO Alan Wells as a mediator in 2007. In September 2010, York announced that it had reached a compromise to construct a discontinuous route, with Donald Cousens Parkway ending at the current Steeles Avenue / Ninth Line intersection, widening the two-laned Steeles to six west of that point, and extending Morningside north to Steeles immediately east of Eastvale Drive. The Regional Municipality of York applied for and obtained environmental assessment approval for this undertaking in July 2011 and January 2013, respectively. In July 2014 it was announced that Toronto and York would begin sharing jurisdiction over of Steeles west from Ninth Line in order to move forward on the planned widening project. In the interim period since the debate erupted in 2005, York Region and the Town of Markham began collaboration on linking Donald Cousens Parkway between Steeles and Highway 407. Markham oversaw construction of the Box Grove Bypass (or Ninth Line Bypass) and Town Arterial Road, (or Box Grove Collector Road), with construction carried out by it and the developers of the adjacent Box Grove community. The Box Grove Bypass was constructed by the town beginning in 2005 and opened in the spring of 2007, partially utilizing the Donald Cousens Parkway alignment along the north side of the CP Havelock railway subdivision. Construction of the Box Grove Collector Road, between the Box Grove Bypass and Highway 407, began in 2009 and included a realignment of 14th Avenue. The developers of the surrounding communities ‚Äì Box Grove Hill Developments Inc. to the north of 14th Avenue and Box Grove Developers Group to the south ‚Äì were contracted to build this section, which was scheduled for completion by December 2010. Although a short portion between Copper Creek Drive and Highway 407 ‚Äî including the unfinished ramps at the interchange ‚Äî was opened by 2011, the remainder of the project was delayed by issues involving a new railway crossing along 14th Avenue. It opened in 2012 at an estimated cost of $15.5 million.  Future  The original intention of the Markham Bypass was to link Highway 48 with Highway 401 via the Morningside Avenue extension through Toronto. York Region planned for a continuous connection between the bypass and Morningside, meeting Steeles Avenue west of its intersection with Ninth Line. However, Toronto resisted, citing the environmental effects that would come from two new crossings over the Rouge River. As such, a discontinuous alignment was planned as a compromise beginning in 2010. Although the Steeles Avenue widening has a construction schedule with construction planned to start in 2020, no timeline or construction schedule for the extension of Morningside north of Oasis Boulevard has been determined. Donald Cousens Parkway will be extended north from Major Mackenzie Drive to tie in with Highway 48, becoming the through-route in the process and completing the Markham Bypass. Poor soil conditions at a planned overpass of the Stouffville GO Train line have required several years of ongoing soil consolidation, beginning in July 2012 and scheduled for completion in the fall of 2017. Construction was set to begin in April 2018, but was later deferred to 2026.

Plot  After prosecutor David Rolfe (Douglas) has racketeer Benny Morgan arrested, mobster Harry Evans (Boyd) gives orders to his chauffeur (Dumbrille) to kill David, but the chauffeur fails. The next day, David's fianc√©e, Margaret Hughes (Colbert), leaves on a cruise with Jimmy O'Neill (Alexander), her friendly suitor, warning David she won't marry a man for whom work is more important than she. David cannot give Margaret a proper bon voyage because he is trying to save his na√Øve young cousin, Phil Long (Tone), from the clutches of gold- digging moll Claire Foster (Tashman), with whom David used to be involved. When David warns Phil that Claire belongs to Evans, Phil takes David's revolver with him to Claire's hotel to confront her. Evans enters in his housecoat and Phil shoots him in the arm. They struggle and Phil is killed. When David arrives, Claire, on Evans' orders, says Phil killed himself, then calls the police and frames David as the killer. In court, David's defense is greatly weakened by Claire's acting ability, and she successfully seduces the all-male jury. Margaret returns for the trial and remarks that a jury of the \\"wiser sex\\" would see right through Claire's histrionics. In order to gather evidence, Margaret goes undercover as blonde gold digger Ruby Kennedy and takes a room adjacent to Claire's. Through diamonds and liquor, Margaret befriends Claire and wheedles her into revealing more about the case. Jimmy and Margaret throw a party for Claire and Evans, and Evans makes several passes at Margaret. During the party, Evans' cook, Fritz (Robert Fischer), who helped him with his wound the morning of the murder, accidentally bumps Evans' arm and Evans scolds him for calling attention to it. The next day, Fritz is found dead, and Margaret now knows the missing bullet from David's gun is lodged in Evans. Margaret then meets Evans for a rendezvous, while Jimmy tells Claire he has lost her to Evans. As Evans' chauffeur identifies Margaret, Claire enters in a jealous rage and reveals Evans as Phil's murderer.

Rise to Power  Myeongnim Dap-bu was a Joui Seonin (Ï°∞Ïùò ÏÑ†Ïù∏) of the Yeonna province of Goguryeo. He rose through the ranks during King Taejo's reign, and was in the courts by the time of Taejo's death. When Chadae rose to the throne in 146, Myeongnim Dap-bu faced many challenges and suffered under the tyrant's reign. Finally, in 165, during the 20th year of King Chadae's reign, Myeongnim Dap-bu led an army and assassinated the king with the support of some of the nobles and court officials. At the age of 99, Myeongnim Dap-bu took control of the Goguryeo government. He invited Prince Go Baek-go, the younger brother of King Taejo, to become the next king. Go Baek-go was proclaimed the 8th King of Goguryeo during that year, and Myeongnim Dap-bu was given the position of Guksang (Íµ≠ÏÉÅ, ÂúãÁõ∏, Prime Minister), and became the first to receive the title in the history of Goguryeo. Myeongnim Dap-bu served faithfully under the new king, and defeated Han Chinese forces at the Battle of Jwa-won.  Death and Accomplishments  Myeongnim Dap-bu died in 179, at the age of 113 (112 by Western convention), after leading Goguryeo forces to victory against a tremendous Han army. Myeongnim Dap-bu served Goguryeo and brought about many benefits during the 60 years at which he was active in the kingdom's affairs. He assassinated a tyrant, strengthened royal power, defeated invaders, and finally, he led a fully successful revolution against a corrupt government.  Controversial views  Historians have shared many different views on the figure of Myeongnim Dap-bu. Goguryeo's first Prime Minister possessed tremendous political power and influence, almost enough to be considered dictatorial. However, King Sindae was not a puppet ruler under influence of Myeongnim Dap-bu, like King Bojang was with Generalissimo Yeon Gaesomun. No historical texts suggest that Myeongnim Dap-bu abused his power or was particularly cruel or violent. From this, many historians and scholars infer that Myeongnim Dap-bu was a true patriot and a forgotten hero.

Fought on 2 May 1645, during the Thirty Years War, it featured a French army led by Turenne, and a Bavarian force under Franz von Mercy. In February, 5,000 Bavarian cavalry were detached to support the Imperial army in Bohemia, most of whom were lost in the defeat at Jankau on 6 March. Mercy avoided Turenne until he had assembled enough troops, and surprised him at Herbsthausen on 5 May. The battle was short, as the inexperienced French infantry dissolved, and over 4,500 prisoners were taken. In August, Mercy was killed at Second N√∂rdlingen, where both sides suffered casualties of over 4,000 each. Although fighting continued, a military solution was no longer possible, and increased the urgency of negotiations that led to the 1648 Peace of Westphalia. Background The Thirty Years War began in 1618 when the Protestant dominated Bohemian Estates offered the Crown of Bohemia to fellow Protestant Frederick of the Palatinate, rather than conservative Catholic Emperor Ferdinand II. Most members of the Holy Roman Empire remained neutral, and the revolt was quickly suppressed. An army of the Catholic League, dominated by Bavarians, then invaded the Palatinate and sent Frederick into exile. His replacement by the Catholic Maximilian of Bavaria changed the nature and extent of the war. It drew in Protestant German states like Saxony and Brandenburg-Prussia, as well as external powers like Denmark-Norway. In 1630, Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden invaded Pomerania, partly to support his Protestant co-religionists, but also to control the Baltic trade, which provided much of Sweden's income. Economic factors meant Swedish intervention continued after Gustavus was killed in 1632, but conflicted with states within the Empire, like Saxony, and regional rivals, such as Denmark. Most of Sweden's German allies made peace in the 1635 Treaty of Prague. The war lost its religious nature, and turned into a contest between the Empire and Sweden, supported by France and George R√°k√≥czi, Prince of Transylvania. Bavarian commander Franz von Mercy; killed at Nordlingen in August 1645 Ferdinand III, who succeeded his father in 1637, agreed to peace talks in 1643, but ordered his diplomats to delay, hoping for a military solution. However, in 1644 the Swedes defeated the Danes, who re-entered the war as an Imperial ally, then destroyed an Imperial army in Saxony. Despite victory at Freiburg in August 1644, the Bavarians under Franz von Mercy were unable to prevent the French capturing Philippsburg, and occupying Lorraine. Mercy withdrew into Franconia, and established winter quarters at Heilbronn. In 1645, Swedish commander Lennart Torstensson proposed a three part attack on Vienna, to compel Ferdinand III to agree terms. While the French advanced into Bavaria, R√°k√≥czi would join forces with the Swedes in Bohemia, who would then move against Vienna. Mercy sent 5,000 veteran Bavarian cavalry under Johann von Werth to reinforce the Imperial army in Bohemia, which was heavily defeated at Jankau on 6 March. Armies of this period relied on foraging, both for men and the draught animals essential for transport, and cavalry; by 1645, the countryside was devastated by years of constant warfare, and units spent much of their time finding supplies. This limited operations and materially impacted the battle, since Turenne had widely distributed his army in order to support themselves. Of his 9,000 soldiers, 3,000 never made it onto the battlefield, while many others arrived too late to influence the outcome. Battle The modern village of Herbsthausen Victory at Jankau seemed an opportunity to knock Bavaria out of the war, and French chief minister Cardinal Mazarin ordered Turenne to bring the Bavarians to battle. Mercy evaded him, until he had more troops and after a month of counter-marching, the French were exhausted and short of supplies; in mid-April, Turenne halted, and distributed his army between Rothenburg and Bad Mergentheim. Here he awaited reinforcements from Hesse-Kassel, a French ally; most of the veteran French infantry had been lost at Freiburg, and Turenne did not yet trust his new recruits. Although only 1,500 of Werth's 5,000 cavalry returned from Bohemia, Mercy gathered 9,650 men and nine guns at Feuchtwangen, and matched north on 2 May. By the evening of the 4th, they were two kilometres from Herbsthausen, a small village south-east of Bad Mergentheim. They made contact with French cavalry patrols under Rosen around 2:00 am; Turenne ordered Rosen to position his cavalry on the right, while Schmidberg assembled the infantry along the edge of a wood overlooking the main road. Taken by surprise, Turenne was unable to deploy his guns, while 3,000 of the 9,000 troops in the area did not arrive at all. The Bavarian artillery opened fire, splinters and branches from the trees increasing its effectiveness, and Mercy ordered a general advance. As was common with inexperienced troops, the French infantry opened fire at too great a distance, and dissolved in panic. Turenne led a cavalry charge that scattered Werth's veterans, and fought his way out with 150 others, reaching Hanau in Hesse-Kassel. The infantry was forced to surrender, along with the garrison at Mergentheim, and 1,500 cavalry; Rosen and Schmidberg were among the roughly 4,500 prisoners. Aftermath Most modern descriptions suggest Turenne was simply taken by surprise, but many nineteenth century French writers blamed Rosen for the defeat. Turenne arrested Rosen in 1647 for mutiny, only releasing him after 14 months, while he has been described as a better 'soldier than general.' While victory restored Imperial morale after Jankau, it left the strategic position largely unchanged. Cond√©, victor of Rocroi, assumed command, and by early July had some 23,000 men. Mercy returned to Heilbronn, where he received 4,500 men from Ferdinand of Cologne, bringing his army up to 16,000. The Bavarian once again demonstrated his ability to out manoeuvre his opponents, but on 3 August, he was killed at Second N√∂rdlingen. Although considered a French victory, both sides lost over 4,000 men, casualties that shocked the French court, and by the end of the year, Turenne was back where he started. The Swedes had also been forced to retreat from Bohemia, but in September, John George of Saxony agreed a six month truce. Ferdinand accepted a military solution was no longer possible, and in October, instructed his representatives at Westphalia to begin serious negotiations.

It is mostly used in point-of-sale equipment, such as receipt printers and barcode readers. History PoweredUSB, as a proprietary variant of USB, was developed and proposed by IBM, Berg (now FCI), NCR and Microsoft between 1998 and 1999, with the last revision (0.8g) issued in 2004. The specification is not endorsed by the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF). IBM, who owns patents to PoweredUSB, charges a licensing fee for its use. 070727 poweredusb.org PoweredUSB was licensed by Hewlett-Packard, Dell Inc., Cyberdata, Fujitsu, Wincor and others.  Implementation  PoweredUSB uses a more complex connector than standard USB, maintaining the standard USB 1.x/2.0 interface for data communications and adding a second connector for power. Physically, it is essentially two connectors stacked such that the bottom connector accepts a standard USB plug and the top connector takes a power plug. The implementation allows a choice of three different voltages, providing power at 5 V (30 W), 12 V (72 W), 24 V (144 W) as well as a custom voltage. Some implementations provide 19 V or 25 V. The connectors are able to operate at up to 6 A (3 A per pin) peak, but according to the specification, hosts are required to provide a minimum sustainable rms current of 1.5 A at 5 V (7.5 W) or 12 V (18 W), or 2.3 A at 24 V (55.2 W), only. For comparison, a standard USB 1.x and 2.0 hosts supplies 5 V at up to 0.5 A (2.5 W).PoweredUSB Electro-Mechanical Specification v0.8g USB 3.0 supplies 5 V at up to 0.9 A (4.5 W) whereas hosts conformant to the USB Battery Charging Specification can deliver up to 1.5 A (7.5 W). As each PoweredUSB plug provides one of three voltages, the plugs come keyed in three versions, so that they will only accept connections from devices requiring that version's voltage. The connectors can be color-coded for different voltages: Gray (Pantone Cool Gray 1C) (sometimes also \\"nature\\" or yellow) for 5 V, blue-green (Pantone Teal 3262C) for 12 V, red (Pantone Red 032C) for 24 V/25 V and violet for 19 V; alternatively, any voltages higher than 5 V can be indicated by a black connector color. The connectors, available from various manufacturers, provide an auto-locking facility to reduce the risk of accidental power failures. Special provisions for hot-plugging are recommended, but optional. The Red 24 volt plugs should never be plugged in or removed with the unit powered on. This is likely to cause the failure of the jack. Outlook Extending USB's power capability is also a response to Power over Ethernet, which has more flexible dynamic power negotiation capabilities up to 48 V DC and up to about 1 A, and whose maximum bandwidth is potentially greater than even USB 3.1's 10 Gbit/s. The combination of USB 3.0 and a 6 A limit at the most common (5, 12 and 24 V DC) voltages would permit support of a wider variety of devices, although powered Ethernet can support them at longer cable distances; however, PoweredUSB does not incorporate USB 3.x officially. In general, since the voltage drop at high currents can be significant over even a few meters, higher voltages are desired for larger distances. In 2012, the USB-IF released the USB Power Delivery Specification (USB PD) as an optional part of the USB 2.0 and 3.x specifications. It defines features similar to those addressed by PoweredUSB, but without requiring the use of proprietary connectors. Instead, the connectors defined in the USB 2.0 and 3.0 standards are continued to be used; higher currents require PD-aware USB-cables, though. USB hosts compliant with this USB specification can be requested by USB devices to provide alternative voltages (9, 15 and 20 V) and higher currents up to 3 A at 5 V (for a power consumption of up to 15 W) and optionally up to 5 A at either 12 V (60 W) or 20 V (100 W).

The Argus was distributed in Washington County, Oregon, United States. First published in 1894, but later merged with the older, 1873-introduced Forest Grove Independent, the paper was owned by the McKinney family for more than 90 years prior to being sold to Advance Publications in 1999. The Argus was published weekly until 1953, then twice-weekly from 1953 until 2015. In early 2017, it was reported that the paper was planning to cease publication in March 2017. The final edition was that of March 29, 2017. History The Argus newspaper traced its history back to 1873. In 1873, the Forest Grove Independent newspaper was founded as the first newspaper in Washington County, Oregon. By December the paper had moved to Hillsboro and named itself the Washington Independent. Albert E. Tozier owned the paper with a partner from 1885 to 1887. Daniel Gault owned the Independent from 1892 to 1902. In March 1894, R. H. Mitchell and C. W. Clow founded a new paper in Hillsboro, the Argus. On March 28, 1894, the first Hillsboro Argus was printed which included a front page advertisement for Hillsboro lawyer and later Congressman Thomas H. Tongue.Communications (100th anniversary of Hillsboro edition). Hillsboro Argus, October 19, 1976. Other news of the day concerned a battle over the county seat of Lincoln County, Oregon. At that time it was a weekly paper of only six pages and was located on Second Street between Main and Washington streets. Argus distribution box in Forest Grove, Oregon In the early years of the Argus, ownership changed hands often, with Mrs. Emma C. McKinney acquiring a half interest in the newspaper in 1904. McKinney‚Äôs son W. Verne McKinney would join the paper in 1923. In November of that year, the size of the paper began to grow beyond the six pages that had included two pages of wire-report news known as boilerplate. Next, in January 1932, the Argus purchased the Independent from S.C. Killen and merged the two papers. The Argus won accolades from the National Editorial Association in 1934, 1935, 1937, 1938, and 1939 for various topics ranging from production to general excellence to editorials. In 1940, it was selected as the best weekly newspaper in the United States for its size by the National Editorial Association. The Argus remained as a weekly publication until November 1, 1953, when it became a twice-weekly newspaper. From 1917 to 1955 the paper was located on Main Street in Hillsboro between Second and Third streets. In 1955, it moved to a building it bought on Third Street between Main and Washington. The Oregon Newspaper Publishers Association awarded the paper the award for best sports coverage in 1988. In 1989, it was selected as the best non-daily newspaper in the United States for papers with a circulation in excess of 10,000 by the National Newspaper Association. The Argus former offices, in use from 1955 to 2014 In October 1999, the Argus was sold by the McKinney family to Advance Publications, Inc. after the family had held ownership interests in the paper since 1904 and had been sole owners since 1909. Advance also owns the region's daily newspaper, The Oregonian. Until 2012, the two papers' operations were completely separate, and the papers competed for stories and advertising revenue, but in January 2012 The Oregonian took over the management of the Argus. As of 2003 the paper had a total weekly circulation of 15,000 copies.Gottlieb, Jane. Picture This: The Photo Column Finds a Place. Columbia Journalism Review, March 2003.

In 2012, the paper's parent company integrated the Argus operations into The Oregonian operations, which in 2014 was followed by the sale of the Argus longtime home on Third Avenue in downtown Hillsboro. The paper's staff moved out of the building in August 2014. At the time of the move, the paper was published on Wednesdays and Fridays.

Written by Phil Klemmer and directed by Jason Bloom, the episode premiered on The CW on May 22, 2007. The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a college student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, Weevil (Francis Capra) enlists Veronica's help in proving his innocence when he is implicated in creating fake student IDs. Meanwhile, Veronica and Piz (Chris Lowell) come to terms with Veronica's FBI internship, and a sex tape of this couple is released on the internet. Logan (Jason Dohring) beats up Piz, thinking that he posted it. In addition, Keith (Enrico Colantoni) and Vinnie (Ken Marino) debate on Piz's radio show about the upcoming Sheriff's election in which they are running against each other. \\"Weevils Wobble But They Don't Go Down\\" features the reappearance of Weevil after an absence of five episodes; during filming of the third season, Capra was undergoing medical treatment. Series creator Rob Thomas pointed out Logan and Piz's fight scene as one of the highlights of the episode and the season. In its original broadcast, the episode received mostly positive reviews from television critics, with many praising the case-of-the-week.  Synopsis  In a checkout line, Veronica and Mac (Tina Majorino) discuss her relationship with Piz and what her FBI internship will mean for them. They then see someone getting arrested by the campus police for a fake debit card. Weevil injures himself, but finds himself unable to receive adequate benefits. Veronica gets Piz to accept her leaving for the internship. At the Sheriff's station, Weevil is called out by several students as being the one who gave them the fake cards. Weevil is put in the jail cell, but he tells Veronica that he think they targeted him after he was showcased in the criminology class. She investigates several of the owners of the student IDs, who do seem genuine in accusing Weevil. Weevil gets bail, but Keith informs him that a student ID printing machine was found in the locker next to Weevil's. Veronica and Wallace speak to a mechanical engineering professor, who says that it would be impossible for Weevil to be the culprit. Piz invites Keith to appear on his show in an election special before Keith informs Veronica that Weevil's fingerprints were found all over the investigation. Keith and Vinnie debate on Piz's radio show, and Vinnie gathers some support about his lax underage drinking policy. Wallace notices someone following him, and the student wants to recruit him for a secret society. Vinnie insults Keith's handling of his home life, and Veronica hits him on the head lightly. She helps Weevil retrace his steps and notices one of her criminology classmates, Jenny (Dianna Agron), involved with one of Weevil's clients. Veronica deduces that Jenny and her circle of friends are responsible for creating the fake student IDs, disseminating them, and implicating Weevil. Logan and Dick (Ryan Hansen) go surfing, and they run into Veronica, Piz, and Mac helping Wallace (Percy Daggs III) with his final project for a class. Veronica learns that one of Jenny's group lives in the same town in Georgia where the student ID machines are made. Veronica is called into a room in the library by Jenny's group, who try to bribe her into not turning them in to the Hearst police. However, she denies and records their conversation as further proof. They are hiding a third ID machine, and Veronica tells Weevil to go and find it. Dick shows Logan a sex tape of Piz and Veronica that has been circulating in an email. Because Logan thinks Piz posted the tape, he attacks Piz and hits him incessantly. Weevil does have a student ID machine, and Logan walks into Mars Investigations with Piz's blood on him.  Production  The episode prominently features series regular Francis Capra, who was experiencing health issues during filming. \\"Weevils Wobble But They Don't Go Down\\" was written by Phil Klemmer and directed by Jason Bloom, marking Klemmer's fifteenth and final writing credit and Bloom's fourth and final directing credit for Veronica Mars, after \\"Green-Eyed Monster\\", \\"Nevermind the Buttocks\\", and \\"Charlie Don't Surf\\". The episode features the final appearance of Dianna Agron, famous for her role as Quinn Fabray on Glee, as Jenny Budosh, Veronica's classmate. Agron had previously appeared in the episode \\"President Evil\\". The episode prominently features Weevil (Francis Capra), who appears after a five episode hiatus. During the third season, Capra was struggling with a medical condition, and the medication he took for this illness caused his face and neck to swell and break out with acne. Series creator Rob Thomas included the scene in which Logan attacks Piz on his list of highlights from the third season. When Thomas first viewed the scene with his wife, she emitted an audible groan when she saw Logan walking through the cafeteria towards Piz, anticipating the fight that was about to come. Thomas thought that most fight scenes on the show were not well-done, as they are filmed quickly and without a second unit. However, he was pleased with the final cut, stating that there was only one punch that he thought looked fake.  Reception = Ratings = In its original broadcast, \\"Weevils Wobble But They Don't Go Down\\" received 1.78 million viewers, ranking 77th of 85 in the weekly rankings. This was a decrease from the previous episode, \\"I Know What You'll Do Next Summer\\", which garnered 2.10 million watchers. = Reviews = Eric Goldman, writing for IGN, graded the episode a 9.0 out of 10, indicating that it was \\"amazing\\". His very positive review focused on the ambiguous nature of the main plot and the subplots of Dick and Logan. He praised the presence of the majority of the main cast members, also stating that Dick's reaction to dealing with his brother was realistic for him and in character. The reviewer called the conclusion to the case-of-the-week a \\"fun and satisfying one\\" that highlighted the moral ambiguity of main characters, something \\"that the show had been lacking for a while.\\" He highlighted this ambiguity in both Weevil in Logan, elaborating that Logan attacking Piz showed an interesting side to his personality that had not been present all season. The reviewer also lauded the cliffhanger ending, stating, \\"it was a reminder of how exciting and intense this show can be at its best.\\" Television Without Pity did not grant the episode a rating but lauded the characterization of Weevil, stating, \\"This is the most consistently written character on the show, bar none.\\" Kelly West of Cinema Blend focused primarily on the series finale in her review but referred to this episode as containing a solid case-of-the- week. \\"Overall it was a good mystery-of-the-week but seeing as it was the second to last episode, the only thing I cared about was that we finally got more Weevil!\\" Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode a mixed review, stating that the case-of-the-week was an oversimplification of the overall themes of Veronica Mars. The reviewer enjoyed the potential for Logan and Dick's character development, although he felt that it was blunted by the knowledge that the series was about to end. \\"As fun as this episode is, the lack of the fourth season stops me from fully enjoying it. [‚Ä¶] But the knowledge that this might be the last time we see them puts a damper on things. Still, better to go out with good episodes than bad.\\"  References  External links  * *‚ÄúWeevils Wobble But They Don‚Äôt Go Down‚Äù at Mars Investigations Category:2007 American television episodes Category:Veronica Mars (season 3) episodes ","title":"Weevils Wobble But They Don't Go Down"},{"id":"10393904","text":"Gamber is an unincorporated community located in Carroll County, Maryland, United States.

Co-written by series creator Rob Thomas and executive producer Diane Ruggiero and directed by Michael Fields, the episode premiered on The CW on May 22, 2007, directly after the previous episode, \\"Weevils Wobble But They Don't Go Down\\". The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she navigates life as a college student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, Veronica investigates the origins of a sex tape of her and Stosh \\"Piz\\" Piznarski (Chris Lowell). Renouncing Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring) because he assaulted Piz, Veronica eventually discovers that the perpetrators are a secret society at Hearst College known as the Castle, headed by Jake Kane (Kyle Secor). Meanwhile, Parker Lee (Julie Gonzalo) ends her relationship with Logan, and Keith Mars (Enrico Colantoni) navigates the issues surrounding his candidacy in the upcoming sheriff's election. Several days prior to airing \\"The Bitch Is Back\\", The CW announced that the series was cancelled. In an effort to prevent Veronica Mars from being cancelled, Thomas had filmed a twelve-minute pitch for a concept involving Veronica in the FBI Academy, but it was rejected. When writing the episode, Thomas and Ruggiero removed seven minutes of material from the original cut; they wanted to create an ambiguous finale that did not resolve everything neatly. At the time of its original broadcast, the episode was viewed by 2.15 million people and received mostly positive reviews from television critics.  Plot  Logan regretfully informs Veronica that there is a sex video circulating of her and Piz, handing her a burned DVD; she berates him and denies the recording is authentic. After viewing the video, she goes to find Piz, who is badly bruised and bleeding, to confirm he was not involved in recording the footage, which he was not. Learning Logan attacked Piz due to mistakenly believing Piz made and released the video, Parker confronts Logan in his hotel room, tearfully breaking up with him because his actions show he still loves Veronica. Veronica arrives as Parker is leaving, and berates him for attacking Piz. She then confronts Dick about the origins of the sex tape, who reveals that he got it from Chip Diller. Veronica intimidates Chip and gets Domonick Desante's name, but Domonick steadfastly refuses to tell her anything. Veronica warns Domonick that he'll regret his refusal, and follows through by cancelling Domonick's credit cards and enlisting Weevil's help to remove Domonick's tires from his car. This leads him to name Gorya Sorokin, whom Veronica later wiretaps, looking for answers. The wiretap leads her to a secret contact method, where she sets up surveillance and is shocked to catch Wallace (Percy Daggs III) as one of the participants. Veronica talks to Wallace and he realizes it's connected to the secret society, The Castle, for which he is being recruited. Wallace tells Veronica that he's out, but she asks him to continue in order to aid her in figuring out what's going on. Wallace discovers the equipment used to tape him in his initial initiation was similar to that which was used to film Veronica and Piz. The members make Wallace go into a room with a chair and a camera, strip down to his underwear and put on a shock collar, and proceed to ask him very personal questions. He hears random yelling, and is told that other recruits will be shocked if he answers untruthfully. He is shocked once when he tells the truth, and upon complaint, he is informed that someone else lied and he received the punishment. When they find Veronica's spy pen in Wallace's discarded clothes, they forcibly remove him, but he is able to figure out the identity of one of the other recruits. Veronica sneaks into the house of the recruit Wallace names, which is revealed to be the Kane residence first by a large portrait of Lilly Kane (Amanda Seyfried), and then by another of Duncan Kane. Approaching voices forces Veronica into hiding behind a curtain, where she observes two men, one of whom is Jake Kane, discussing The Castle. After they leave, Veronica steals Jake's hard drive. Keith, as interim sheriff, investigates the robbery the following day, spotting Veronica on a surveillance camera belonging to Kane's neighbor; however, he does not initially report his daughter. Veronica brings the hard drive to Mac (Tina Majorino) for help, and Mac leads her to a campus supercomputer to crack Jake Kane's very secure password. The supercomputer finally cracks the password and they discover documents, audios, and videos, some dating back to the 1930s, incriminating The Castle members for various ill deeds and illegal activity, taken at the time of each individuals' initiation (similar to what they tried to do to Wallace). When Veronica arrives home, she finds her room tossed, and realizes it was Keith, who questions Veronica about whether or not she broke into the Kane house, despite already surmising her guilt from the evidence. Jake and a county prosecutor arrive at Keith's office the next day, indicating they will get a judge's order and return to prosecute Veronica. Keith hands over the surveillance evidence to the county prosecutor later, after he first visited the evidence room, removed a large magnet from a big speaker, and using it to erase it to hide Veronica's involvement. This leads to charges filed against Keith for tampering with evidence, likely meaning that he will lose the votes needed to win the sheriff's election, as it was printed in the newspaper. Logan tries to apologize to Veronica, but is rebuffed. Moments later, Gorya brags to Veronica that the organization videotaped her, and Logan assaults him, despite Veronica's warning that Gorya is 'connected-connected'. Veronica later returns the hard drive to Jake Kane on the condition that he does not tell Keith about it. She goes into a voting booth and votes for Keith as sheriff, then walks away in pouring rain, leaving many open-ended questions.  Production = Writing, filming, and promotion = \\"The Bitch Is Back\\" was co-written by series creator Rob Thomas and executive producer Diane Ruggiero and directed by Michael Fields. The episode marked Thomas's ninth writing credit, Ruggiero's seventeenth installment of the series, and Fields's eighth episode. The scene in which Veronica rebukes Logan was included because the writers thought that it would be a good note on which to end a season, even though it would not be the two characters' final interaction in the series. Fields was heavily involved with the actors during filming of this scene. Thomas highlighted the scene in which Logan attacks the Castle member for showcasing the romantic ambiguity between Logan, Veronica, and Piz. Thomas counseled Lowell about his facial expression before filming, and he was pleased with the end result, stating that \\"it breaks my heart\\". While editing the final script, Thomas and Ruggiero had to remove roughly seven minutes from the original draft, including a scene featuring dialogue between Veronica and Leo. Later, Thomas thought that removing this scene made one voiceover by Veronica too sudden. Thomas called the scene in which Keith makes Veronica dinner \\"quintessential Keith\\" and indicative of his lasting commitment to his daughter. Despite knowing that the episode could be the series finale, Thomas did not want it to completely resolve all plot lines; his intention was to keep viewers guessing and prevent the conclusion from being too bland or typical. He ultimately felt that the final shot of Veronica walking away from the voting booth in the rain was \\"a pretty melancholy way to go out\\". The song \\"It Never Rains in Southern California\\" by Albert Hammond plays during the final scene. In promotional advertising for the episode, The CW billed it as a season finale, despite the fact that the series had already been cancelled. = FBI pitch = Series creator Rob Thomas created the FBI concept. Before cancellation, Thomas proposed his idea for season four to take place in the FBI Academy. Prior to the airing of \\"Un-American Graffiti\\", Enrico Colantoni stated that The CW had seen the filmed first ten pages and reacted negatively. However, Thomas denied this assertion and commented that The CW had not yet seen the FBI pitch. He added that it would be presented on May 2, the day after the series came off a two-month hiatus. Thomas's statement was confirmed by a representative for the network. Thomas filmed a twelve-minute teaser for his new concept and presented it to The CW. The teaser was later released on the Veronica Mars third season DVD and the internet. The clip begins in medias res with Veronica, pretending to be a high schooler, talking to a teacher. The teaser flashes back to her first FBI meeting, and the viewers discover that she is investigating the teacher for sexual abuse allegations. She successfully catches the teacher on camera, and at the FBI, she runs into a former acquaintance named Seth. She investigates a potential bomber with another novice agent, and they speak to a man who appears to be innocent. However, he points a gun at Veronica's partner as the clip ends. Thomas had initially planned for Veronica to be in the FBI during a hypothetical seventh or eighth season of Veronica Mars. He accelerated his initial vision of the show in an attempt to prevent its cancellation. Although he believed that the new concept would appeal to CW executives, he commented, \\"I'd be thrilled for [Veronica] to come back in any incarnation.\\" The teaser was presented to the network on May 2, 2007. Nellie Andreeva of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that Dawn Ostroff, president of The CW at the time, had responded positively to the new concept. The series's title might have been changed if the FBI idea had been accepted. The CW had recently cancelled Gilmore Girls, leading some news outlets to speculate that Veronica Mars might be renewed in order to fill a schedule hole. Several cast members, including Gonzalo and Lowell, had taken other acting opportunities in anticipation of the series's cancellation. Nevertheless, Thomas stated, \\"I don't think we're dead; I kind of like our chances.\\" = Cancellation = Michael Ausiello initially reported on the series's cancellation. Veronica Mars was one of roughly five series being considered for cancellation by the network in 2007. At The CW's upfront conference, critic Michael Ausiello asked Ostroff about the fate of the show. She responded that Thomas and Bell could work together on another show for the network, but she thought that this possibility was unlikely. She said that \\"it could come back in some form, but I don't know what form that would be\\". Thomas responded, \\"I assume that anything Dawn would be talking about in the realm of a Rob‚ÄìKristen project would involve a new from-scratch pilot as they don't have me in a deal, and they'll lose Kristen in a couple of weeks.\\" At the conference, Ostroff officially cancelled the series, saying about the FBI idea that \\"it's not going to happen\\". Upon the cancellation of the series, a group of fans who called themselves the \\"Cloud Watchers\\" sent more than 10,000 Mars bars to The CW, hoping that the network would reverse its decision and renew the series. Several years after cancellation, Thomas expressed interest in creating a feature film based on the show.  Analysis  Several reviewers have commented on themes of the episode; topics of discussion included the relationship between parents and children, class relations, the scene in which Logan attacks the perpetrator in Veronica's sex tape case, and the final scene in relation to the overall moral of the series. According to Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club, the episode contained a role reversal between Veronica and Keith, with Keith violating the law. He noted the scene in which Keith erases the surveillance tapes of Veronica as illustrating the theme that \\"the two aren't so different after all.\\" Roger Holland of PopMatters thought that the episode demonstrated that Veronica and Keith's relationship was the central component of the show: \\"it was all about Veronica and Keith. And beyond that, about parents, children, and the myriad ways they can fuck each other up.\\" Stephanie Zacharek, writing for Salon, thought that the final scenes of \\"The Bitch Is Back\\" \\"cement the dour reality, posited at the very beginning of the series, that the rich ... are always going to be the ones in charge.\\" Holland referred to Veronica's line \\"I don't want his apology\\" in the scene in which Logan assaults Gorya Sorokin as indicative of one of the main themes of the series: \\"She's not interested in apologies. She's driven by a nihilistic need for action and payback.\\" Eric Goldman of IGN wrote that the scene \\"had an air of ambiguity that could be interpreted in many ways.\\" The reviewer elaborated that Veronica's smile could have indicated further romantic interest or that Logan might have been killed in retaliation for attacking Gorya. Zacharek stated that the episode's ending \\"[felt] truncated, unfinished. It gave us no clear signposts telling us where, exactly, these characters are headed next, where they'll end up.\\" Holland said that the theme of the final scene \\"seemed emphatically clear and killingly accurate. Life's a bitch until you die.\\" Goldman wrote that the ending was fitting for the series: \\"Veronica Mars wasn't exactly a show that was driven by happy thoughts or events, even though we wouldn't have minded the characters ending up happy.\\"  Reception = Ratings = On its initial showing, \\"The Bitch Is Back\\" was viewed by 2.15 million viewers, ranking 74th of 85 in the weekly rankings. This figure was an increase from the previous episode, \\"Weevils Wobble But They Don't Go Down\\", which aired immediately prior and garnered 1.78 million watchers. However, this number was a ratings decrease from both the third season premiere, \\"Welcome Wagon\\", and the previous season finale, \\"Not Pictured\\", which received 3.36 and 2.42 million viewers, respectively. = Reviews = Enrico Colantoni's performance was frequently singled out for praise. The episode received mostly positive reviews from television critics. Eric Goldman of IGN graded the episode an 8.3 out of 10, indicating that it was \\"great\\". He thought that the finale did not resolve every plot line by the end of the episode. However, he did not blame the writers, because they were not planning for the episode to be a series finale. He enjoyed the final scene between Logan, Veronica, and Piz because of the variety of different ways in which it could be interpreted. While he expressed some frustration over Keith's criminal charges and the ambiguity regarding the outcome of the sheriff's election, he opined that one could still take away important messages from the show because of Keith's actions in the episode. The reviewer also lauded the final scene, writing that \\"the melancholy feeling of the final scene ‚Äì with Veronica walking through the rain, having cast a vote for her dad that is probably meaningless ‚Äì felt right for the series\\". Amy Ratcliffe of IGN listed \\"The Bitch Is Back\\" as the eighth-best episode of Veronica Mars. She wrote that the episode \\"brings the show full circle\\", returning Veronica to the position of a social outcast, and concluded by describing the episode as \\"a winner\\". Alan Sepinwall, on his blog, What's Alan Watching?, praised the episode, stating that it was one of his favorite installments of the series. He thought that the series's early film noir influences returned in the finale, a choice he lauded. In addition, he commended Bell and Colantoni's performances, stating that the final scene \\"is a bleak ending, but strangely appropriate\\". Television Without Pity graded the episode an \\"A\\". Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, praised the finale, writing that it functioned well within the context of the series and the season: > We get significant emotional resolution between Keith and Veronica, whose > relationship is the core of the show. We get to see Veronica being a badass, > which is when Veronica Mars is at its most entertaining. All the supporting > characters get something defining to do. The show engages with its history. > And most importantly, it's a fantastic episode. He went on to laud the interaction between Veronica and Keith and the latter's eventual sacrifice for his daughter. In addition, he felt that the supporting characters, including Wallace, Parker, and Piz, also received appropriate sendoffs. He later ranked the episode as his fifth-favorite of the series. Kelly West of Cinema Blend gave a mixed review. She enjoyed the elements that resembled the first season, such as the return of Jake Kane and the portrait of Lilly. She thought that \\"The Bitch Is Back\\" was satisfying within the context of the season, but that it was too ambiguous for a series finale: \\"How can the show not come back? How can they leave us with Veronica and Logan still apart?\\" Stephanie Zacharek of Salon felt positively about the episode itself but ambivalent about the lack of resolution, stating, \\"I'm not sure if Tuesday night's finale is a deeply unsatisfying way to close out a series that's ending before its time or the only way to end such a series.\\" However, she blamed the network for this ending. She also commented on the tone and themes of the episode, arguing that one of the series's main takeaways was that the rich would always be in charge. However, she did not view the finale as being spiteful and pessimistic: \\"'Veronica Mars' has always been a clear- eyed show, never a bitter one.\\" Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly felt unsatisfied with the episode's conclusion, partially because Veronica and Logan did not resume dating. However, he praised the sex-tape mystery and the plot involving the Castle because of their similarities to earlier seasons. He also praised Keith's actions, stating, \\"Okay, maybe I'm a sap, but this tugged at my heartstrings a bit and left me relieved there wasn't a dreaded Veronica‚ÄìKeith battle at the end.\\" Stransky concluded by saying that \\"the end is fine\\". Sydney Bucksbaum of Zap2it felt disappointed because of the ambiguous endings of Keith's arc and Veronica's love triangle. Although she was positive towards \\"The Bitch Is Back\\" as a standalone episode, she found herself hoping that there were another episode to the season: \\"Watching Veronica walk out into the pouring rain all alone after casting a probably insignificant vote for her dad was depressing, symbolic (rain in SoCal?), and just downright unsatisfying.\\" Roger Holland of PopMatters praised the episode. He wrote that the finale \\"took us all the way back to the heart of Veronica Mars\\". Although he also commented on the lack of closure in \\"The Bitch Is Back\\", he still believed that the finale highlighted some of the main themes of the series. \\"The final scenes of Veronica Mars offered no sense of closure. Rather, we were left with the sense [that] we'd been denied a genuinely thrilling fourth season\\". The TV Addict lauded the episode for returning to the tone and themes of the first season, calling it \\"the perfect mix of mystery, excitement, romance and snappy one-liners\\". The publication also praised Bell and Colantoni's performances. Jesse Hastenger of PopMatters graded the episode an 8 out of 10. Kath Skerry of Give Me My Remote expressed dissatisfaction with The CW for cancelling the series, but she praised the episode as a standalone installment: \\"As for the final two episodes themselves, they would have been magnificent season finales. It was classic Veronica Mars. Drama, comedy, inside jokes [...] and callbacks to yesteryear.\\" On his blog, Cultural Learnings, critic Myles McNutt said that Colantoni should have been nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for his performance in the episode, saying that \\"this final sacrifice is Colantoni's strongest character arc all season and is the proper episode selection for the actor.\\" On a ranking of all 64 Veronica Mars episodes, BuzzFeed ranked the episode 54th, declaring that it was \\"extremely disappointing\\" and \\"pretty dull\\".

Cause  In 1212, Albert II, Count of Dagsburg, the last ruler of the County of Moha, died without a son. Both Henry I, Duke of Brabant and Louis II, Count of Loon were related to Albert and claimed the county. Henry was also allied with the King of France, who threatened to invade Flanders, the traditional ally of the Bishopric of Li√®ge. This gave Henry the chance to invade the Bishopric, and to besiege Li√®ge. Badly prepared, the Duke of Brabant retreated, plundering and looting the Bishopric and setting fire to Tongeren. Bishop Hugh Pierrepont rallied his allies, Louis II, Count of Loon, Henry III, Duke of Limburg and the citizens of Huy, to pursue the Brabantines. The battle The two parties agreed to deliver battle in the plain of Steppes. Henry aligned his army, in three battalions, on the higher ground with the sun in their backs. He also gave his armour to one of his knights, Henry of Huldenberg, to avoid being targeted during the battle. Hugh placed the Louis on the right flank with the Duke of Limburg in the center, while Hugh occupied the left flank. Louis attacked first, drawing the Brabantine re-enforcements to the right wing. Then the rest of the Li√®ge army attacked the weakened left and center. Overwhelmed by the all out charge, the Brabantine army broke and ran. Henry of Huldenberg, the knight in the armour of Duke Henry, was killed. The Li√®ge militia army, eager on revenge for the destruction in their lands, butchered the Brabantine infantry. They pursued the fleeing army for several kilometers, killing everyone they could. The wounded were savagely mutilated and no quarter was given.  Consequences  The battle of Steppes is one of the first battles where a professional army was beaten by a civilian army. Moha was annexed to Li√®ge. The battle gave birth to the local legend of the intervention by the Virgin Mary, when a statue of her reflected the sun, blinding and causing panic amidst the Brabantines. This miracle is still celebrated every year in May.

It saw service for three centuries, including the First World War and the Second World War. It amalgamated with the 8th King's Royal Irish Hussars, to form the Queen's Royal Irish Hussars in 1958. History=Formation and early history= George Paget, 4th (Queen's Own) Light Dragoons, Dublin 1850, who commanded the regiment during the Crimean War (Michael Angelo Hayes, 1850) The regiment was first raised by the Hon. John Berkeley as The Princess Anne of Denmark's Regiment of Dragoons in 1685, as part of the response to the Monmouth Rebellion by the regimenting of various independent troops, and ranked as the 4th Dragoons. The regiment transferred its allegiance to King William III in February 1689 and fought the depleted forces of James II in Scotland in later that year. The regiment saw action at the Battle of Steenkerque, where it suffered heavy losses, in August 1692 and at the Siege of Namur in July 1695 during the Nine Years' War. The regiment suffered heavy losses again at the Battle of Almansa in April 1707 during the War of the Spanish Succession and next fought at the Battle of Sheriffmuir in November 1715 during the Jacobite rising. The regiment saw action at the Battle of Dettingen in June 1743, when Trooper George Daraugh bravely recovered the regimental standard that had been seized by a French officer during the War of the Austrian Succession. The regiment suffered a serious reverse when it was ambushed during a series of disastrous events leading up to Fall of Ghent in July 1745 and then fought bravely to mitigate the British defeat at the Battle of Lauffeld in July 1747. The regiment was formally titled as the 4th Regiment of Dragoons in 1751 and, having helped suppress the Gordon Riots in 1780, it was named for Queen Charlotte as the 4th (Queen's Own) Regiment of Dragoons in 1788. The regiment fought at the Battle of Talavera in July 1809 under Sir Arthur Wellesley and then contributed to a successful ambush of the enemy at the Battle of Usagre in May 1811 during the Peninsular War. The regiment took part in a successful charge at the Battle of Salamanca in July 1812 and in the aftermath seized some of Joseph Bonaparte's silver; it then fought at the Battle of Vitoria in June 1813 and at the Battle of Toulouse in April 1814. The regiment was designated a light dragoons in 1818, becoming the 4th (The Queen's Own) Regiment of (Light) Dragoons and went to fight at the Battle of Ghazni in July 1839 during the First Anglo-Afghan War. The charge of the Light Brigade, October 1854; The 4th (Queen's Own) Light Dragoons were in the second line of cavalry (in the middle of the picture) on the right flank (towards the back of the picture) The regiment next saw action, as part of the light brigade under the command of Major General the Earl of Cardigan, at the Battle of Alma in September 1854. The regiment was in the second line of cavalry on the right flank during the Charge of the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava in October 1854. The brigade drove through the Russian artillery before smashing straight into the Russian cavalry and pushing them back; it was unable to consolidate its position, however, having insufficient forces and had to withdraw to its starting position, coming under further attack as it did so. The regiment lost four officers and 55 men in the debacle. Private Samuel Parkes was awarded the Victoria Cross during the charge for saving the life of a Trumpeter, Hugh Crawford. The regiment became the 4th (Queen's Own) Hussars in 1861. Winston Churchill was commissioned as a cornet in the 4th Hussars in February 1895. =First World War= 2nd Lt Winston Churchill in 1895 The regiment, which was based on the Curragh at the commencement of the First World War, landed in France as part of the 3rd Cavalry Brigade in the 2nd Cavalry Division in August 1914 for service on the Western Front. The regiment took part in the Great Retreat in September 1914, the First Battle of Ypres in October 1914 and the Second Battle of Ypres in April 1915. The regiment also helped halt the German advance at the Battle of Moreuil Wood in March 1918 in a conflict that saw the regiment‚Äôs commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel John Darley, killed in action. =Inter-war= The regiment was retitled as the 4th Queen's Own Hussars in 1921: it moved to India that year and remained there until 1931; the regiment mechanised in 1936 and was transferred to the Royal Armoured Corps in 1939. =Second World War= Winston Churchill inspecting men of the 4th Queen's Own Hussars at Loreto aerodrome, Italy, 25 August 1944 The regiment was posted to the Middle East arriving on 31 December 1940 and as part of the 1st Armoured Brigade in the 6th Australian Infantry Division fought in the Greek Campaign. As the rearguard in the Corinth Canal Bridge action the regiment was overrun and surrendered losing all senior officers and over 400 men as prisoners of war. In June 1941, the regiment was reconstituted in Cairo and rejoined the 1st Armoured Brigade. Badly mauled during the Battle of Gazala in May 1942 and having lost almost an entire squadron, which had been attached to the 3rd County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters), in June 1942, the regiment was temporarily amalgamated with one squadron from the (similarly depleted) 8th King's Royal Irish Hussars to form the 4th/8th Hussars for the Battle of Alam el Halfa in August 1942 and the Second Battle of El Alamein in October 1942. The regiment fought with distinction in the Italian campaign during the allied advance into the Axis territories. Winston Churchill became Honorary Colonel of the Regiment in 1941 and served until amalgamation. =Post-war= After the Second World War, the 4th Hussars deployed to L√ºbeck in Germany in March 1947 from where the regiment was sent to serve in the Federation of Malaya in September 1948. It returned to the UK in December 1951 and was then posted to Caen Barracks in Hohne in September 1953. The regiment was slated for reduction in the 1957 Defence White Paper, and was amalgamated with the 8th King's Royal Irish Hussars, to form the Queen's Royal Irish Hussars in 1958.

The engine of a long-tail boat, showing the simple construction. The long-tail boat, (, ,History of Ayutthaya - Boating in Ayutthaya ) is a type of watercraft native to Southeast Asia, which uses a common automotive engine as a readily available and maintainable powerplant. A craft designed to carry passengers on a river may include a lightweight long canoe hull, up to 30 metres, and a canopy. There is much variation among these boats, some have evolved from traditional craft types, while others have a more improvised look--the sole defining characteristic is a secondhand car or truck engine. This engine is invariably mounted on an inboard turret-like pole which can rotate through 180 degrees, allowing steering by thrust vectoring. The propeller is mounted directly on the driveshaft with no additional gearing or transmission. Usually the engine also swivels up and down to provide a \\"neutral gear\\" where the propeller does not contact the water. The driveshaft must be extended by several metres of metal rod to properly position the propeller, giving the boat its name and distinct appearance. Advantages to the inboard engine with a long driveshaft include keeping the engine relatively dry. Following the basic design pattern allows a variety of engines to be attached to a variety of different kinds of hulls. This flexibility simplifies construction and maintenance while sacrificing the efficiency and comfort that might be expected of a typical mass-produced product. Engine cooling is provided by a metal pipe underneath the rear running board which is used as a rudimentary heat-exchanger. This is then coupled to the engine using rubber or plastic hoses. Clean water is then used as the coolant. Control is achieved by moving the engine with a lever attached to the inboard side. Ignition and throttle controls provide simple means to control the craft. Larger boats may include more than one \\"tail,\\" with several operators piloting in tandem. Long-tail boats are now often used to transport tourists. There are also competitions involving long-tail boats in some provinces of Thailand. Future of the long-tail Thailand's most distinctive form of coastal transport is in danger of becoming obsolete. In 1989, the Thai government banned logging of natural forests. This led to a shortage of timber used in boat making, and required the wood to be imported from other countries. With a recent increase in the cost of imported timber, there has been a drastic decline in the number of new boats constructed, which has caused the price of an individual boat to skyrocket. A few years ago, a long-tail boat cost about 3,000 baht (US$83). Now, according to Chot, a local long-tail boat captain on Ko Samui, Thailand, a boat costs almost 70 times as much. \\"Now, it's over 200,000 baht (US$5,500). That's 200,000 only for the hull of a new boat,\\" Chot said, \\"not including the engine.\\" As a consequence, long-tails are sharing the water with an increasing number of speedboats. Speedboats hold more people and they travel faster, tempting some guides to switch from longtails to speedboats.

With only a short portage, it forms a navigable route for small craft connecting Lake Huron and Crooked Lake, across the Northern Michigan region. Despite Little Traverse Bay being only 2 miles west of Crooked Lake, the waterway does not connect to it, making Lake Michigan inaccessible through this route. The route is in Emmet and Cheboygan counties and consists of Crooked Lake, Crooked River, Burt Lake, Indian River, Mullett Lake, and the Cheboygan River. The route passes through or near the communities of Conway, Oden, Ponshewaing, Alanson, Indian River, Topinabee, and Cheboygan. History Indian River =Early history= The Inland Waterway was originally used by Native Americans to avoid the strong waves around Waugoshance Point on Lake Michigan. Consequently, 50 Native American encampments have been discovered along the shores of the Inland Water Route. One such encampment, located in Ponshewaing, has artifacts dating back over 3,000 years. =Settlement in 1800s= The Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad reached Petoskey in 1873. This opened up the surrounding area to tourism, settlers, and lumbermen. This eventually led to various people proposing different ideas for the water way. One such plan was the transportation of mail along the waterway. This involved the dredging of Crooked River. Freight was eventually transported along the route. With the advent of the railroad as a cheaper means with which to move goods, the Inland Waterway fell into decline.

It was built in 1920‚Äì1921 by James Henry LaTrobe and Thomas Harry Weston (1870-1923) and opened by the Duchess of Beaufort on 29 November 1921. It formerly had a ballroom, billiard room and restaurant but in 1978, it became a three screen cinema rather than having a single screen. As part of the ABC chain, the cinema was eventually absorbed by Odeon, in a merger undertaken by the private equity firm Cinven. With another Odeon nearby on Broadmead's Union Street, the decision was taken to close down and sell the Whiteladies in 2001 with a restrictive covenant forbidding its future use as a cinema.Empire magazine, March 2007 The cinema has been designated by English Heritage as a grade II listed building. While the front section of the building has been divided off to create a restaurant, the majority of the building, including the main auditorium, balcony and ballroom, remained empty since its closure in 2001 until its reopening in 2016. The building was allowed to deteriorate and was on Bristol City Council's \\"at Risk\\" register, deeming it to be in danger of being lost due to lack of use, under-use, disrepair, or dereliction. Several plans were put forward to redevelop the building. The most recent planning application to convert the building into a gym and flats was rejected by Bristol City Council, went to appeal and was finally defeated in March 2013. In November 2010 a not-for-profit company, Whiteladies Picture House Ltd, was set up by Alan Mandel Butler and David Fells (manager of the local Redgrave Theatre) to raise awareness of the building and its history and to begin the journey of raising the necessary capital to reopen the Picture House as a mixed-use venue with a 450-seat theatre and a 200-seat cinema. The company reached out to the local community to aid in its campaign and were instrumental in blocking the planning application to convert the building into a gym and flats and bringing the building back into the public eye. In 2013, Alan Mandel Butler left the company to pursue other projects and David Fells began working with Jonathan Lees Architects to develop plans to preserve the existing historic fabric of the building, including the original Art Deco auditorium. It is currently operated by Everyman Cinemas. It is the company's first branch in Bristol and it opened on 20 May 2016.http://www.everymancinema.com/venues/bristol/ The redevelopment also includes five new flats on the upper floor, where the ballroom and billiards room used to be.  Equipment  Prior to 1956 the cinema was equipped with Ross 35mm Projectors. These projectors were originally designed as silent with add-on sound units that were located between the projector and the lower spool-box, added later. Two types were available at the time of the talkies, Westrex and RCA models. The auditorium and projection room were modified to accommodate the arrival of the 70mm Todd_AO film format in time for the screening of Oklahoma, released in December 1956. The modifications to the projection room included enlarging the area into the rear of the circle so as to accommodate the new Phillips DP70- AAII projectors, the accompanying Mole-Richardson arclamps, Westinghouse Rectifiers and Phillips surround sound per-amplifiers. The MR arclamps only being used for 70mm presentations due to the need for greater light coverage on the larger screen area. For 35mm presentations, on a smaller area of the screen, the MR arclamps were swapped to the more reliable, more efficient Peerless Magnarcs. Besides the alterations to the rear of the circle for the enlargement of the projection room, the circle was also extended toward the screen to increase audience capacity. The proscenium arch was also moved into the auditorium to increase the backstage area to house the 5 surround sound loudspeakers and the 43feet wide screen. Also housed backstage were the motors to drive the adjustable black cloth screen-masking and the Phillips surround sound main-amplifiers. Some other alterations were made to improve access and exits in line with changes to increased seating. The projection equipment removed prior to the installation of the Phillips DP70 was reinstalled at the Associated British Cinema ‚ÄòThe Kings‚Äô in Old Market St. In 1966 the Phillips DP70 projectors and the Mole-Richardson arclamps were removed and reinstalled at the Associated British Cinema at New Bristol Centre cinema Frogmore St. New 35mm only Phillips FP20 projectors equipped with both optical and magnetic soundtrack capabilities replaced the dual 70mm / 35mm equipment that had been moved to Frogmore St.  References External links *Everyman Bristol Category:Cinemas in Bristol Category:Grade II listed buildings in Bristol Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1921 Category:Buildings and structures in Clifton, Bristol ","title":"Whiteladies Picture House"},{"id":"10394185","title":"Eddie Wiseman"},{"id":"10394188","text":"The Phantom President is a 1932 American pre-Code musical comedy and political satire film.

Cohan was bitter that his type of musical theatre had gone out of fashion, supplanted by the more literate and musically sophisticated shows of Rodgers and Hart, among others. During the filming, Cohan would sarcastically refer to Rodgers and Hart as \\"Gilbert and Sullivan\\". However, in 1937 Cohan starred in I'd Rather Be Right, a musical with songs by Rodgers and Hart.

He is best known today as the author of the largest medieval Chronicle, which he composed in Syriac. Various other materials written in his own hand have survived. Life The life of Michael is recorded by Bar Hebraeus.Wright, Syriac Literature, p.250 f., referencing Bar Hebraeus, Chron. Eccl. vol. 1, p.575 f. He was born ca. 1126 in Melitene (today Malatya), the son of the Priest Eliya (Elias), of the Qindasi family.Wright, A short history of Syriac literature, p.250, n.4, referencing Bar Hebraeus, Chron. Eccles., vol. 1, 537. His uncle, the monk Athanasius, became bishop of Anazarbus in Cilicia in 1136. At that period Melitene was part of the kingdom of the Turcoman Danishmend dynasty, and, when that realm was divided in two in 1142, it became the capital of one principality. In 1178 it became part of the Sultanate of R√ªm. The Jacobite monastery of Mar Bar Sauma was close to the town, and had been the patriarchal seat since the 11th century. As a child, Michael entered the service of the monastery, and became archimandrite before the age of thirty. He made various improvements to the abbey fabric, including improving the water supply and the defences against raiders. On 18 October 1166 he was elected Patriarch of the Jacobite church, and consecrated in the presence of twenty-eight bishops. In 1168 he made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and then stayed for a year at Antioch. Both towns were at the time part of the Latin crusader states, and Michael established excellent relations with the crusader lords, especially with Amaury de Nesle, Latin patriarch of Jerusalem. Returning to the monastery of Mar Bar Sauma in the summer of 1169, he held a synod and attempted to reform the church, then tainted with simony. The Byzantine emperor Manuel I Comnenos made approaches to him to negotiate a reunion of the churches. But Michael did not trust the Greeks. He refused to go to Constantinople when invited by the emperor, and even refused twice, in 1170 and 1172, to meet his envoy Theorianus, instead sending as his own representative bishop John of Kaishoum and then his disciple Theodore bar Wahbun. In three successive letters to the emperor, he replied with a simple statement of the miaphysite creed of the Jacobites.Wright, Syriac Literature, p.252, n.3. Around 1174 Michael had to contend with a revolt by a party of bishops. He himself was twice arrested at the instigation of the dissident bishops, so he says; once by the servants of the prefect of Mardin and the second time by those of the emir of Mosul. Also the monks of Bar Sauma rebelled against him in 1171 and 1176. Between 1178 and 1180 he resided again in the crusader states, at Antioch and Jerusalem. He was invited by Pope Alexander III to attend the Third Council of the Lateran, but declined. However he did participate by letter, writing a long treatise on the Albigensians, based on the information he had been given. In 1180 his former pupil Theodore bar Wahbun had himself elected patriarch at Amida under the name of John by certain malcontent bishops, beginning a schism which lasted for thirteen years. Michael took energetic action, got hold of the anti- patriarch and locked him up at Bar Sauma and formally deposed him. Some of monks allowed Ibn Wahbon to escape, who fled to Damascus and tried in vain to appeal to Saladin. He then went to Jerusalem, and, after the fall of the city in 1187, went to Rumkale with the Armenian catholicos Gregory IV, who allowed him to obtain official recognition from Prince Leo II of Armenian Minor. Theodore had many supporters, and the schism did not end until the death of Theodore in the summer of 1193. According to Bar Hebraeus Theodore could write and speak in Syriac, Greek, Armenian and Arabic, and composed a statement of his case against Michael in Arabic.Wright, A short history p.254. In 1182, Michael received the sultan Kilij Arslan II at Melitene, and held cordial talks with him. Michael was also involved in the Egyptian controversy over the doctrine of confession, and supported Pope Mark III of Alexandria in the excommunication of Mark Ibn Kunbar. He died at the monastery of Bar Sauma on 7 November 1199 at the age of seventy-two, having been patriarch for thirty- three years. His nephew, Michael the Younger, known as Yeshti' Sephethana [Syriac ‹ù‹∏‹´‹¨›Ç' ‹£‹∏‹¶‹ó‹∏‹¨‹ó‹≤‹¢‹≤] or \\"Big-lips\\",Short History of Syriac Literature at Digitized by the Internet Archive became anti-patriarch at Melitene from 1199‚Äì1215, in opposition to Athanasius IX and then John XIV. Works Michael was a profuse author. He wrote works on the liturgy, on the doctrine of the Jacobite church, and on canon law. Numerous sermons have also survived, mostly unpublished. But he is best known for the World Chronicle that he composed, the longest and richest surviving chronicle in the Syriac language. =The Chronicle= Armenian translation of Michael the Syrian Chronicle, manuscript of 1432 This Chronicle runs from Creation up to Michael's own times. It uses earlier Ecclesiastical Histories now lost; for instance, its coverage of the Late Antique period relies mainly upon Dionysius of Tel Mahre. It includes a version of the Testimonium Flavianum. The work is extant in a single manuscript written in 1598 in Syriac in a Serto hand. This was copied from an earlier manuscript, itself copied from Michael's autograph. The manuscript is today held in a locked box in a church in Aleppo and not accessible to scholarship. However the French scholar Jean-Baptiste Chabot arranged for a copy to be made by hand in 1888 and published a photographic reproduction in four volumes (1899‚Äì1910), with a French translation. In 2009, the facsimile of Edessan-Aleppo codex was published by Gorgias Press in the first volume (edited by Mor Gregorios Yuhanna Ibrahim) of a series on the Chronicle of Michael the Great. A digital facsimile is also available in vHMML Reading Room. An abbreviated Armenian translation also exists, from which Victor Langlois published a French translation in 1868. This alone preserves the preface of the work. A shorter Armenian version also exists which has not been published. A Garshuni version is also extant in British Library ms. Orient. 4402, and an Arabic version beginning with book 5 exists in a Vatican manuscript.J.B.Chabot, Chronique... vol. 1, p. ii. As secondary witnesses: Bar Hebraeus, pseudo-Jacob, and Maribas the Chaldean all rely upon Michael's work. =Points of interest= His work has been used by NASA scientists because of his record of climatic changes, now known to be linked to volcano eruptions.

After a philosophical education at the University of Paris he entered the convent of the regular canons at Groenendaal near Brussels (circa 1377), where he met John of Ruysbroeck. In 1386 he became prior and master to the novices. After the accession Groenendaal to the Windesheimer congregation he wrote many sermons, some of which became the most well-known writings at the general chapter. Beside these and other sermons, spiritual writings and letters, he wrote the then celebrated Epistola responsalis super epistolam cancellarii. Schoonhoven was one of the responsible for defending Ruysbroeck against critics, especially Jean Gerson. His works, all written in Latin, reflect the influence of Ruysbroeck. However, his works focus more on practical ascese. He represents an important link in the evolution of spirituality from Ruysbroeck and Geert Groote until Desiderius Erasmus. Bibliography *A.

He is also the first amputee to reach the summit of Mount Everest on his first attempt, and the first disabled person from Asia to stand on the summit. Nawang, a trans-tibial amputee, is a native of Tapting in the Himalayan region of Solukhumbu in Nepal. He grew up with a love of mountains and a dream to climb Mount Everest some day. He had completed part of his training to become a high altitude Sherpa guide when he was injured in a traffic accident in Kathmandu in 2000. Despite months of hospitalization, his left leg required amputation, ending his climbing career and dream to climb Everest. A group of Nawang's American friends responded to his plight, and arranged for him to fly to California where he received a donation of his first sturdy prosthetic leg from the Orthopaedic Surgery Department of the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) in May 2001. He had arrived from Nepal on tattered crutches; a month later he returned walking strongly on two legs. In the spring of 2002, he met the famous double amputee and high- altitude mountaineer/airline pilot Ed Hommer of Minnesota in Kathmandu as Ed returned from an attempt to climb of Mount Everest. They became friends and Ed invited Nawang to join him on his next Everest expedition which was planned for 2003. Unfortunately, Ed Hommer was killed by rockfall while training on Mount Rainier in the autumn of 2002. However, in 2004 Nawang's friend Tom McMillan of the San Francisco Bay Area received an opportunity to climb Mount Everest and immediately invited Nawang to climb with him as his climbing partner. This was the genesis of their very successful 2004 Friendship Beyond Borders Expedition. The High Exposure Foundation, established in the 1990s in Minnesota by Ed Hommer, offered to help Nawang achieve his Everest dream with donations of high-tech prosthetic equipment suitable for mountain climbing and trekking. Ed Hommer's prosthetist, Tom Halvorson, oversaw Nawang's fittings and coached him on how to hike and climb at extreme altitudes safely. This enabled Nawang to successfully trek across the high Himalayan Khumbu region of Nepal for days to reach Everest basecamp, climb steep snow and ice slopes during the many weeks of acclimatization ascents partially up the mountain and back, then make the final continuous push to the summit and back during a perfect \\"weather window\\" on the mountain. Each day he had to carry‚Äîin addition to his food, water, extra clothes, and other supplies‚Äîa spare prosthetic leg in case of problems. Another extraordinary aspect of his accomplishment is that Nawang chose not to do any physical training before the expedition, as he was concerned about possibly damaging his knee or prosthetic leg. In addition, nausea during his summit push prevented him from eating during the three-day climb up to the summit and the two-day descent back to basecamp. During the April 2006 Friendship Beyond Borders expedition, Nawang made a partial ascent of the sixth highest peak in the world, Cho Oyu, on the Nepal-Tibet border about 12 miles from Mount Everest. For that climb, Nawang and the team were assisted by Nawang's younger brother Ang Dawa Sherpa and friend Nima Gombu Sherpa. Record snowfall amounts and logistical problems prevented the team from reaching the summit that year. Nawang has received many honors for his achievement, including the Everest Award from the Nepal Mountaineering Association and the prestigious Suprabal Gorakha Dakshin Bahu (Third) Gold Medal from His Majesty the King of Nepal.

His whole body was covered with long hair that gave him the appearance of a lion; this was likely due to a rare condition called hypertrichosis. Bibrowski was born in 1890 in Bielsk near P≈Çock in Congress Poland with one-inch hair covering his body. His mother (Benedict) blamed the condition on the mauling of his father (Michael) by a lion, which she witnessed while pregnant with Stephan. She considered Stephan an abomination and gave him up to a German impresario named Sedlmayer when he was four years old. Sedlmayer gave him his stage name and started exhibiting him around Europe.Ph√§nomen Freakshows By the time he was put on exhibit, Lionel's hair had grown to eight inches (twenty centimetres) on his face and hung about four inches (ten centimetres) everywhere else. His body was almost entirely covered with hair, the only exceptions being the palms of his hands and the soles of his feet. In 1901, Lionel traveled to the United States and started appearing with the Barnum and Bailey Circus. He toured with the circus from then on, occasionally going back to Europe. In his act, Lionel performed gymnastic tricks, and also spoke to people to show his gentle side that sharply contrasted with his appearance. He settled in the U.S. in 1920, becoming a popular attraction, and moved to New York City, where he was a fixture at Coney Island. By the late 1920s, Lionel retired from his sideshow career and moved back to Germany. He was reported to have died in Berlin from a heart attack in 1932 at forty-one years old.

Those involved in the conflict were the French forces led by Marshal Josias Rantzau and the armies of the Holy Roman Empire and Spain led by Franz von Mercy. Technically, Mercy led a military force composed of Imperial, Spanish, Bavarian, and Lorrainer troops. In early November the French-Weimarian forces had taken up winter quarters along the Danube in Tuttlingen. Outlying detachments were posted at M√ºhlingen and M√∂hringen. With the French inactive, Mercy convinced the other Imperial generals to join forces for a surprise attack on the French encampment. To maximize surprise, the Imperials approached from the south-east instead of further to the north where the Danube and the French garrison at Rottweil blocked their way. At mid-afternoon on 24 November, Johann von Werth led 2,000 cavalry in the first assault group against M√∂hringen and achieved instant success, riding down a French infantry regiment composed of Spanish prisoners of war. The Bavarian dragoons captured the French pickets posted near Tuttlingen, allowing the Imperials to seize with minimal opposition the lightly defended French artillery park in the cemetery outside town. The Weimarian cavalry in M√ºhlheim attempted to reinforce the French at Tuttlingen but were intercepted and defeated by Mercy's brother Kaspar. Kaspar then destroyed the Weimarian infantry remaining at M√ºhlheim. The French cavalry now fled the scene. The captured guns were used to bombard the helpless French infantry in Tuttlingen and M√∂hringen, who capitulated the next day along with their commander Rantzau. The fighting lasted for a day and a half, not so much due to the effectiveness of Franco- Weimarian resistance but because of the disorganized and isolated nature of their detachments. The 2,000 strong French garrison in Rottweil surrendered a week later. Rantzau's army largely ceased to exist, the remnants retreating back across the Rhine River into Alsace.Croxton, pp. 981, 987. Moreover, Mercy held Rantzau, seven other generals, 9 colonels, 10 guns, the whole baggage and seven thousand French troops captive. Another 4,000 lay dead or wounded. The Weimarian army was permanently crippled by this disaster.

The house is a three-story Second Empire wood frame structure with a mansard roof. Its date of construction is not known, but is surmised to be sometime before the 1890s. The house is not architecturally distinguished, but its exterior has not been significantly altered since its construction. The interior, which follows a center hall plan, has had modernizing alterations, including conversion of the front parlor to have a cathedral ceiling, and the addition of modern plumbing facilities. 125px George David Birkhoff was born in Michigan and educated at the University of Chicago and Harvard in mathematics.

It was designated a District of Columbia Historic Landmark in 1993, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. The building is visible from the NoMa‚ÄìGallaudet U Metro station.  History  The warehouse was designed by Abbot, Merkt & Company, a group of architects noted for their work in designing warehouses, and was constructed between 1937 and 1939. Built to incorporate areas for service, storage, and delivery, it is one of the few examples of such a mixed- use warehouse still extant in the Washington area. The structure is considered to be the most ambitious warehouse built in the area before World War II, and is one of the city's largest warehouses. The property was owned by Woodward & Lothrop until the company foundered in 1995. It was subsequently taken over by the Bristol Group, a San Francisco-based company, and converted to office space. Tenants include the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,http://www.eeoc.gov/contact.html the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, the United States Department of Homeland Security, and the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.  Architecture  Tower on the roof Architecturally, the building is considered notable because it was constructed in the Streamline Moderne style; unusually for a warehouse, its design was not meant to be merely utilitarian. According to the District's Historic Preservation Office, it was this \\"highly refined architectural expression unusual for [a] utilitarian structure\\" that led, in part, to its recognition as a historic structure. One of the most prominent features of the building is its large pink neon sign, identifying it as a Woodward & Lothrop property, which remains on the building's exterior. There are no plans to remove the sign, as it is considered an integral part of the building's historic nature. Along with the Lothrop Mansion, the warehouse is one of two D.C. Historic Landmarks directly associated with now-defunct department store chain Woodward & Lothrop.

Two treaties have been implemented under the BCTP. The Nisga'a Treaty is considered separate from the Treaty Process because those negotiations began before the BC treaty process was started, and it has been called a blueprint for the current process. To represent the interests of First Nations involved with the process, the First Nations Summit was created. There are officially 60% of First Nations bands in the process, but only 20% are said to be making progress. About 40% of First Nations are not involved in the treaty process. History=Previous negotiations= Because the Royal Proclamation of 1763 stated that the Crown must negotiate and sign treaties with the Indigenous people before land could be ceded to a colony, the Numbered Treaties were negotiated in most parts of the Prairie Provinces. The Government of the Colony of British Columbia, however, failed to negotiate many treaties and as a result, most of the province's land is not covered by treaties. The few exceptions are the 14 Douglas Treaties on Vancouver Island, Treaty 8 (1899) in the Northeast of B.C., and the 2000 Nisga'a Final Agreement. Relations between Indigenous peoples and the B.C. government worsened over time, as the McKenna‚ÄìMcBride Royal Commission led to the redistribution of reserve lands and the Allied Tribes of British Columbia was essentially dissolved by an amendment to the Indian Act. First Nations were not allowed to organize or raise money to pursue land claims. In the second half of the 20th century, demands for the recognition of Aboriginal title were buoyed by various court decisions in B.C., including Calder v. British Columbia (Attorney General) and R. v. Sparrow. In 1990, the governments of Canada, B.C. and First Nations established the B.C. Claims Task Force to investigate how treaty negotiations might begin and what they should cover. The following year, the provincial government accepted the concept of Aboriginal rights (including the inherent right to self-government) as official policy. The Claims Task Force made 19 recommendations and suggested a six-stage process for negotiating new treaties. = Treaty Commission and process= The British Columbia Treaty Commission is the independent body which oversees the treaty process. B.C. treaty commissioners were first appointed in April 1993, and the treaty process officially began in December 1993. By 1996, 47 First Nations, representing more than 60% of status Indians in B.C., had decided to participate. After a few years of negotiations, the Treaty Commission released the 1997 Systems Overload Report which argued that the provincial and federal governments needed to increase their financial resources and the capacity level of First Nations for the negotiation of treaties in BC. The following year, the Supreme Court of Canada rendered its decision on Delgamuukw v. British Columbia, recognizing Aboriginal title as \\"a right to the land itself\\", which derives from First Nations original occupation and possession at the time the Crown asserted sovereignty. The court also stated that the federal and provincial governments may infringe upon Aboriginal title under conditions for justification but that fair compensation would be due at the time of such an infringement. Sechelt First Nation was the first community to sign an agreement-in-principle (AIP) in 1999. Members of the Sliammon First Nation voted to reject their negotiated AIP in 2001, approved the AiP in June 2003, and negotiations are now nearing completion. Six of 12 member nations of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council likewise rejected their AIP. The five Maa- nulth First Nations of the Nuu-chah-nulth ratified their treaty in October 2007. The BC government has ratified the final agreement which is yet to be ratified in the federal parliament. Ditidaht First Nation has subsequently taken legal action against the Maa-nulth in a dispute over land and resource ownership. In 2002, the governing BC Liberal Party mailed out ballots for a provincial referendum on principles for treaty negotiations. However, the referendum failed due to controversy over is phrasing and logistics, which generated protests and a boycott. In May 1993 the Treaty Commission allocated approximately $432 million in negotiation support funding to more than 50 First Nations: $345.6 million in the form of loans and $86.4 million in the form of contributions. Unavailable 11Feb. 2020. Of that money the Treaty Commission's total operating costs from 1993 to March 31, 2009, spent $34.2 million. One successfully negotiated treaty was rejected, by the Lheidli T ºenneh First Nation, in 2007. In July 2007, the Tsawwassen First Nation members voted 70% in favour of the treaty. The treaty more than doubled the size of the Tsawwassen reserve, provided a one-time capital transfer of $13.9 million, $2 million for relinquishing mineral rights under English Bluff, $13.5 million for startup and transition costs, $7.3 million for a number of funds for the purposes of resource management and economic development and $2.6 annually for ongoing programs and services, and reserves a portion of the Fraser River salmon catch to the Tsawwassen. In return, the Tsawwassen abandoned other land claims and will eventually pay taxes. The Temexw Treaty Association, whose members are signatories to the Douglas Treaties, is also attempting to negotiate within the BC Treaty Process. A November 2007 court ruling for the Xeni Gwet ºin First Nation has called future participation in the process into question. The judge's ruling included a non-binding opinion that the Xeni Gwet ºin could demonstrate Aboriginal title to half of the Nemaiah Valley, and that the province had no power over these lands.Huge win for Interior natives , The Province, November 22, 2007 Under the BC treaty process, negotiating nations have received no more than 5% of their claimed land recognized. Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, president of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs, called the court victory a \\"nail in the coffin\\" of the B.C. treaty process. Notwithstanding, such legal victories (sustained later in the 2015 Supreme Court of Canada decision, Tsilhqot ºin Nation v British Columbia, the BC Treaty Process continues, very much \\"alive\\" as numerous Nations (more than half of all First Nations in BC) continue through the stages of the process. As of 2016, 4 Nations had completed and were implementing treaties; 7 were in Stage 5, and 42 were in Stage 4.BC Treaty Commission Negotiations Update Process The treaty process is a six-stage negotiation between the federal government, the provincial government, and First Nations. A combination of contribution (grant) funding and loans are provided to First Nations on cost-share basis by the federal and provincial governments to support negotiation efforts. The British Columbia Treaty Commission accepts First Nations into the process, allocates negotiation support funding and monitors the progress of negotiations. The process: * Stage 1: statement of intent to negotiate * Stage 2: readiness to negotiate * Stage 3: negotiation of a framework agreement * Stage 4: negotiation of an agreement in principle * Stage 5: negotiation to finalize a treaty * Stage 6: implementation of the treaty  Criticisms  The voice of criticisms have come from different angles in Indigenous communities across British Columbia and Canada, and from the non-native society as well.Alfred, Taiaiake. Was√°se. Broadview Press, 2005. . About 2/3 of First Nations are not involved with the Treaty Process, some have formed the \\"Unity Protocol\\", calling for an overhaul of the entire process. * Extinguishment of Aboriginal title * Continued assimilation strategies * Changing the Indigenous peoples from nations to municipal style government. The Fraser Institute, a Canadian think tank, released a report in 2008 criticizing the B.C. Treaty Process as \\"incomplete, illiberal and expensive\\".

It, too, is a 16-voice multitimbral music (synthesizer) utilizing Yamaha's Advanced Frequency Modulation; Advanced Wave Memory; and the combination of these two systems, either by layering together or by modulating an AFM voice by an AWM wave, a synergy termed Realtime Convolution and Modulation Synthesis (RCM). The unit came into production in 1989, simultaneously with the SY77. The 77 series (and its successor, the SY99) feature various filters, which digitally model those of analog equipment and include the popular feature of self-oscillation from the latter. Each of up to four Elements within a Voice can have its own filter, which can be controlled by a dedicated envelope generator. The TG77 is equipped with two sets of stereo outputs, like the SY77, and is enhanced compared to the latter by having eight individual outputs, which are assignable to individual internal instruments. Like the SY77, the TG77 has a large LCD display, and programming takes place through a keypad on the front panel. The SY/TG series can generate rich, layered, multitimbral sounds. It is capable of the characteristic timbres of DX7-style FM synthesis but can also expand upon this greatly with various new FM features (hence the A in AFM) and the addition of sampled waveforms (AWM). There are large libraries of patches and expansion cards available for the SY/TG series that enable the user to expand the tonal capabilities of the unit.

Power began her career in repertory theatre and went on to appear in several West End musicals. However, she best known for her work on British television, in particular her role as Christine Hewitt in the BBC soap opera, EastEnders (1992‚Äì1993). She has since gone on to feature in various stage productions. Early life Power was born in Eastbourne, East Sussex. She began singing and dancing lessons at the age of four, prompted by her mother, who was very keen for her to perform. However, at the age of 14, Power concluded \\"that she wasn't physically suited to be a dancer\\", so she decided to take up acting on the advice of her teacher. Power auditioned for a place at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) at the age of 17, and was accepted. She has commented \\"I just glided into it so I was still naive‚Ä¶Rada was good and I realised there was more than just going on stage and being clapped.\\"\\"Stepping out in comic style\\", TheNorthernEcho. URL last accessed on 30 September 2007. Power graduated from RADA in 1966.  Career  Power began her acting career on stage, appearing at a young age as Alison in a revival of the Slade-Reynolds Christmas musical, The Merry Gentleman, at the Bristol Old Vic in 1959.\\"Unsung Heroines\\", www.musical- theatre.net. URL last accessed on 30 September 2007. After leaving RADA in 1966, she worked for 18 months at the Belgrade Theatre, Coventry. She had various roles in repertory theatre during her early career, and has since commented: \\"I got lots of jobs in rep, learning my craft and playing totally unsuitable roles‚Äîold ladies and the sort of stuff you did in those days.\\" Power went on to appear in various West End musicals. In 1969 she played the leading role, Lucy, in Two Cities, a British musical about the Charles Dickens story A Tale of Two Cities, which played at the Palace Theatre, London. She later toured in a production of The Pajama Game, and in 1972 she played Avonia Bunn in the Julian Slade musical, Trelawny, which was based on the Pinero play Trelawny of the Wells. The show opened at the Bristol Old Vic, then transferred to Sadler's Wells Theatre and later the Prince of Wales Theatre, with Power staying for its entire run. In 1974 she was cast in the revue Cole, built around the songs of Cole Porter, which played at the Mermaid Theatre. The following year she appeared in So Who Needs Marriage?, a musical written by Monty Norman, which toured for a few weeks in May 1975. So Who Needs Marriage? ended uo being Power's \\"swansong\\" in musicals. She has since commented that the musicals of the late 1960s and early 1970s were not the sort of shows that suited her vocal talents: \\"The musicals were mainly American imports. If you didn't have that big chesty voice, there was no place for you‚Ä¶\\" Power switched to television acting in the 1970s. One of her first television roles was in the BBC science fiction series Doctor Who and the Silurians in 1970. She went on to appear in the BBC drama series Softly Softly (1973); The Magician's Heart (BBC, 1973); Lillie (ITV, 1978); Hazell (1978); a regular role as Celia Travers in Crown Court (ITV, 1978‚Äì1982); Juliet Bravo (BBC, 1981), and Prince Regent (BBC, 1979). Power's most notable television role has been her portrayal of Christine Hewitt in the BBC soap opera EastEnders. Power was offered the role by one of the programme's producers, Leonard Lewis, for whom she'd worked with previously on Juliet Bravo and Softly, Softly. She has commented \\"I got a call out of the blue asking if I could go up to the BBC at Elstree to meet him. Mrs Hewitt was going to be in five episodes and I thought, 'wonderful'.\\" Mrs Hewitt made her first appearance on-screen in February 1992, as a lonely divorcee who employed the long running character, Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher), to tend to her garden‚Äîused as a plot device to rebuild Arthur's relationship with his son Mark Fowler (Todd Carty), while they worked together on Christine's garden. Power filmed her scenes for the five episodes and thought that would be the end of it; however, she was subsequently contacted by Leonard Lewis and asked to reprise the role. Power commented \\"It was all I could do to stop myself screeching down the phone. They didn't tell me which direction the story was going to take. I got on so well with [Bill Treacher] from the word go. We really liked each other.\\" Mrs Hewitt was reintroduced in a storyline that saw her become Arthur Fowler's mistress, but when the affair ended Power left the series, making her final appearance on-screen in October 1993. Power has subsequently appeared in the horror film Tale of the Mummy (1998), a role that reunited her with actor Bill Treacher on-screen as husband and wife. Power and Treacher were offered the parts by director Russell Mulcahy, who was an \\"avid fan\\" of them in EastEnders. Power has commented \\"[Russell Mulcahy] was in Hollywood but used to get friends to video the Arthur and Mrs Hewitt scenes. So he thought it would be a good idea to get us together again. He thought it would be a great joke. We played a caretaker and his wife.\\" Power has also appeared twice in the BBC medical soap Doctors (2001; 2004), but she has been most active in theatre rather than television post EastEnders. She appeared in Alan Bennett's Habeas Corpus at Farnham in 1993, and in 2001 she starred in Richard Harris' award-winning comedy Stepping Out, as a stern piano teacher, Mrs Fraser. She lent her skills to the International Festival of Musical Theatre in Cardiff in 2002, and starred in Trevor Baxter's adaptation of The Picture of Dorian Gray, which toured the UK in 2003.\\"Liz swaps Square for powerful new role\\", South Wals Echo.

They were scheduled to begin the first of several surgeries to separate them at Rainbow Babies and Children's Medical Center in Cleveland, Ohio. However, in August 2007 the surgery was called off as too dangerous. The twins were born in Rome, Italy to Romanian parents, Alin Dogaru, a Byzantine Catholic priest, and Claudia Dogaru, a nurse. Their mother heard about the successful separation of Egyptian-born twins who were also joined at the head and hoped her children could also be successfully separated. The Dogaru family ‚Äî who also have an older daughter, Maria, and younger son Theodor ‚Äî were brought to north Texas by the World Craniofacial Foundation to have Anastasia and Tatiana evaluated for possible separation. The girls are currently developing normally for their age and speak both Romanian and English. They get around with Anastasia leading the way and Tatiana following. The top of Tatiana's head is attached to the back of Anastasia's. Anastasia, whose kidneys don't function, relies on her sister's kidneys, and Tatiana on her sister's circulatory system. The girls also share blood flow to the back of the brain and some brain matter. Doctors estimated the twins had only a 50 percent chance of surviving the surgery. There were also risks of complications, such as brain damage, but the girls also risk early death if they remain conjoined. Their parents believed separation would give them their best chance at living a normal life. In May 2007, doctors used a catheter to insert wire coils into the veins of the two girls, successfully redirecting their blood flow. It was the first time the procedure was attempted in conjoined twins. Doctors pushed back the first of the planned separation surgeries to June 2007 while studying the complex circulatory system of the twins, but, in August of that year, decided it was too risky.

Pair of Lovers, engraving by Master E. S., 1460s. He has discarded his very long left patten; she still wears hers. Pattens are protective overshoes that were worn in Europe from the Middle Ages until the early 20th century. Pattens were worn outdoors over a normal shoe, had a wooden or later wood and metal sole, and were held in place by leather or cloth bands. Pattens functioned to elevate the foot above the mud and dirt (including human effluent and animal dung) of the street, in a period when road and urban paving was minimal. Etymology The word patten probably derives from the Old French patte meaning hoof or paw. Women continued to wear pattens in muddy conditions until the nineteenth or even early 20th century. In appearance, they may resemble contemporary clogs or sandals, but though historical usage was apparently not always consistent, the term now is used only to describe protective overshoes worn over another pair of shoes. Medieval period Pattens were worn during the Middle Ages outdoors and in public places over (outside) the thin soled shoes of that era. Pattens were worn by both men and women during the Middle Ages, and are especially seen in art from the 15th century: a time when poulaines, shoes with very long pointed toes, were particularly in fashion. Medieval pattens were known in English by the terms: 'patyns', 'clogges', and 'galoches', but the original shades of meaning and distinction between these terms is now unclear.Grew, F & De Neergaard, M: Shoes and Pattens'2001. Medieval and Early Modern overshoes are now all usually referred to as 'pattens' for convenience. =Types= There were three main types of pattens: one with a wooden 'platform' sole raised from the ground by either with wooden wedges or iron stands. The second variant had a flat wooden sole often hinged. The third type had a flat sole made from stacked layers of leather. Some later European varieties of these pattens had a laminated sole: light wooden inner sections with leather above and below. In earlier varieties of pattens, dating from the 12th century on, the stilt or wedge variety were more common. From the late 14th century, the flat variety became increasingly common. Leather pattens became fashionable in the 14th and 15th centuries, and in London appear to have begun to be worn as shoes over hose in the 15th century, spreading to a much wider section of the public. Most London patten soles were constructed of alder, willow or poplar woods. In 1390, the Diocese of York forbade clergy from wearing pattens and clogs in both church and in processions, considering them to be indecorous: \\"contra honestatem ecclesiae\\".OED despite quotation being in Latin: \\"clogges et pattenes\\" Conversely, the famous rabbi Shlomo ibn Aderet (the Rashba, c. 1233‚Äìc. 1310) of Aragon was asked if it was permissible to wear patines on Shabbat, to which he replied that it was the custom of \\"all the wise in the land\\" to wear them, and certainly permitted. Since shoes of the period had thin soles, pattens were commonly used mainly because of unpaved roads and also that indoor stone floors were very cold in winter. Furthermore, refuse in cities ‚Äì animal especially horse feces and human effluent (from chamber pots)‚Äì was usually thrown directly into the street (often with minimal advance warning). Making full foot contact with such an unpleasant surface was, understandably, highly undesirable. Thus, pattens tended to only make contact with the ground through two or three strips of wood and raised the wearer up considerably, sometimes by four inches (ten centimetres) or more in contrast to clogs, which usually have a low, flat-bottomed sole integral to the shoe. Early Modern period A maid wearing circle-type pattens: Piety in Pattens or Timbertoe on Tiptoe, England 1773 A later pattern of patten which seems to date from the 17th century, and then became the most common, had a flat metal ring which made contact with the ground, attached to a metal plate nailed into the wooden sole via connecting metal, often creating a platform of by several inches (more than 7 centimetres). By this time men's shoes had thicker soles and the wealthier males (the gentry or gentlemen) commonly wore high riding boots, thus pattens seem only to have been worn by women and working-class men in outdoor occupations. Since dress hems extended down to the feet for most of this period, it was necessary to raise the hem above the ground to keep the dress clean even in well-swept and paved streets. The motto of the London Worshipful Company of Pattenmakers, the former representative guild for this trade, was and remains: Recipiunt F≈ìmin√¶ Sustentacula Nobis, Latin for Women Receive Support From Us. The 19th-century invention of cheap rubber galoshes gradually displaced the patten, as did the widespread use of urban paving, especially elevated, paved pathways only for pedestrians- the now ubiquitous pavements, sidewalk in American English or hard road surfaces. =Etiquette and practicality= Wearing of pattens inside church was discouraged, if not outright forbidden: perhaps because of the noise they made, the oft-commented \\"clink\\" being the consensus term for the sound; Jane Austen wrote of the \\"ceaseless clink of pattens\\" referring to life in Bath.Persuasion, start of Chapter 14 To talk excessively and too loudly was coined to be as if one: \\"had your \\"tongue run (or go) on pattens\\", used by Shakespeare and others.Taming of the Shrew and OED In houses, pattens were taken off with hats (for men) and overcoats upon entering, not doing so being considered rude and inconsiderate by bringing dirt inside ‚Äì literally a faux pas or wrong step. The aunt of the Bront√´ Sisters, Miss Branwell, seems to have been considered notably eccentric for wearing her pattens indoors: Huge pattens worn by two 18th-century Turkish women, pastel by Jean-√âtienne Liotard, who visited Turkey in 1738 Pattens were not always easy to walk in, and despite their practical intention, literary evidence suggests that they could appear, at least to males, as a further aspect of feminine frailty and dependency. Samuel Pepys recorded in his diary for 24 January 1660: From the Middle Period Poems of John Clare (1820s): :: (\\"hitops\\" are high boots) From Thomas Hardy's The Woodlanders of 1887, though set earlier in the century: Other uses of the term The word could also be used as a term for a wooden soled shoe, that is a chopine or clog, as opposed to an overshoe, until at least the nineteenth century. The word was also used for the traditional wooden outdoor shoes of Japan and other Asian countries. What are in effect snowshoes for mud, as used by wildfowlers, boatmen, and Coast Guards may also be called pattens, or \\"mud-pattens\\". These are shaped boards attached to the sole of a shoe, which extend sideways well beyond the shape of the foot, and therefore are a different sort of footwear from the patten discussed here. \\"Horse-pattens\\" were used on horses, especially for ploughing muddy fields. The word was also used for ice-skates, as it is in French (patiner, to skate). The Worshipful Company of Pattenmakers In London, the Worshipful Company of Pattenmakers remains the Livery Company, formerly guild of the Patten-makers, or Patteners, and their adopted church remains St Margaret Pattens. The first record of the guild dates to 1379, and there was still a pattenmaker listed in a London Trade Directory in the 1920s. A notice, probably 18th century, in the Guild Church still requests ladies to remove their pattens on entering; other English churches have similar signs, and in one case, a board with pegs for ladies to hang them on.

Both the square and compasses are architect's tools and are used in Masonic ritual as emblems to teach symbolic lessons. Some Lodges and rituals explain these symbols as lessons in conduct: for example, Duncan's Masonic Monitor of 1866 explains them as: \\"The square, to square our actions; The compasses, to circumscribe and keep us within bounds with all mankind\\". However, as Freemasonry is non-dogmatic, there is no general interpretation for these symbols (or any Masonic symbol) that is used by Freemasonry as a whole. With a \\"G\\" 220px In many English speaking countries, the Square and Compasses are depicted with the letter \\"G\\" in the center.http://phoenixmasonry.org/the_g_in_masonrys_emblem.htm The letter has multiple meanings, representing different words depending on the context in which it is discussed. The most common is that the \\"G\\" stands for God. Another is that it stands for Geometry, and is to remind Masons that Geometry and Freemasonry are synonymous terms described as being the \\"noblest of sciences\\", and \\"the basis upon which the superstructure of Freemasonry and everything in existence in the entire universe is erected.

Written by Claude Binyon, Robert Lees, and Frederic I. Rinaldo, the film is about a sophisticated female photographer assigned to photograph the tough \\"sandhog\\" construction workers at a tunnel project site. After saving one of the sandhogs from a fatal accident, she becomes attracted to this cocky well-built man they call Superman. Unsettled by her feelings, she hires the man as her assistant, believing that her attraction to him will diminish if she spends time with him. Their time together, however, leads to feelings of love, and she struggles to overcome her haughtiness and make her true feelings known. No Time for Love was the third of six films starring Colbert and MacMurray, both of whom had previously worked with director Mitchell Leisen. The film was shot at Paramount Studios from June 8 to July 24, 1942. A special set was constructed for the tunnel scenes, based on blueprints for the Brooklyn‚ÄìBattery Tunnel. A special mix of adobe and water was used to produce the mud in the climatic scenes. No Time for Love was released by Paramount Pictures on November 10, 1943 in New York City. The film received good reviews in Variety and the New York Times, whose reviewer called it a \\"delightful comedy\\" and \\"a thoroughly ingratiating film\\". The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Art Direction‚ÄìInterior Decoration, Black-and-White (Hans Dreier, Robert Usher, Samuel M. Comer). Plot Mirror magazine's top photographer Katherine Grant (Claudette Colbert) is assigned to photograph the Interborough Vehicular River Tunnel project in New York City. Wearing a hardhat and boots, the beautiful photographer is taken underground to the construction site where she is not greeted warmly by the superstitious tunnel workers, called \\"sandhogs\\", who believe that women in the tunnel bring bad luck. When she sneaks closer to the drilling point to get a better view, her presence distracts some of the workers and causes an accident that nearly kills Jim Ryan (Fred MacMurray), the cocky well-built sandhog they call \\"Superman\\". When she sees the unconscious Ryan about to be crushed by a machine, she drags him to safety. Later in the compression chamber, a revived Ryan gets into a fistfight with his co-workers after they taunt him about being saved by a woman. During the brawl, Katherine photographs Ryan as he's beating up the other sandhogs. On their way out of the tunnel, Ryan notices that Katherine is flirting with him and tells her he's not interested. Insulted by the brush off, she informs him that she has a boudoir chair with more integrity than he has. Back at home, Katherine shows her photographs to her sister Hoppy (Ilka Chase) and their snobbish sophisticated friends‚Äîher effete suitor and Mirror publisher Henry Fulton (Paul McGrath), playwright Dunbar (Morton Lowry), and composer Roger Winant (Richard Haydn)‚Äîwho make fun of the brawling \\"ape\\". Just then, Ryan arrives at Katherine's apartment to return the tripod she left behind and demands to see the \\"chaiah\\" that has more integrity than he does. Unimpressed, Ryan kisses a flustered Katherine flush on the lips and then dismisses her, having regained his confidence. Before he leaves, Ryan is approached by Henry and Dunbar who demand that he provide details of his heroic fistfight; picking up on their condescension, Ryan reenacts the fight, roughing them up in the process. In the coming weeks, Katherine is haunted by disturbing dreams of Ryan as Superman rescuing her from Henry as an evil assailant. Meanwhile, Ryan loses his job after Henry publishes the photograph of the sandhogs fighting. When Ryan shows up at her apartment, Katherine assures him she did not know the photo would be published, and offers him a job as her assistant to offset his lost wages. Thinking that if she spends time with him, she will prove to herself that he is not worthy of her. They go on several assignments together, and despite his flirtations with various cheap blondes, Katherine eventually falls in love with Ryan who returns her feelings. One night after sharing a passionate kiss, they are spotted by Hoppy who reveals Katherine's original plan to get him off her mind. Feeling that he's been used, Ryan walks away disgusted. Sometime later, the tunnel project is threatened by repeated cave-ins resulting from the constant flow of \\"muck\\" coming in from the riverbed. The project's one hope at stabilizing the muck is a new machine and chemical process invented by Ryan‚Äîan engineer‚Äîwho was working as a sandhog to better understand the problems of underwater construction. Assigned to cover the testing of this new machine, Katherine returns to the tunnel and is shocked to learn that the inventor is Ryan. She sneaks into the testing area and finds a good vantage point, while Ryan and the sandhogs start up the machine and remove some planks holding back the muck. At first the test appears to fail, but as Katherine takes several photographs, the chemical reaction begins to solidify the muck. Just then a breach of the upper wall creates a muck-slide that nearly buries Katherine. Ryan and the others abandon the machine to save her. Afterwards, the officials declare Ryan's test a failure. After everyone leaves, Katherine convinces Roger and one of the sandhogs to accompany her back into the tunnel to retrieve the camera, which she believes can prove that the machine was working. They find the camera and indeed the photos show that the muck flow was stopping when the breach occurred. When she shows her proof to the city officials, they agree to move forward with the project under Ryan's leadership, accepting Katherine's condition that Ryan never know that she was responsible for the decision. Believing that Ryan will never forgive her for all the trouble she's caused, she accepts Henry's marriage proposal. Knowing that Katherine is still in love with Ryan, Roger visits him at his office and reveals her plan to marry Henry, despite her true feelings for Ryan. One of Ryan's showgirl acquaintances overhears and goes to Katherine's apartment, barges into her engagement party, and warns her to stay away from Ryan. When she slaps her, Katherine responds by knocking her off her feet with one punch just as Ryan arrives. Ryan takes Katherine and Henry into her bedroom. Holding up Henry with one hand and the \\"chaiah\\" with the other, he asks her to choose. When she chooses Ryan, he picks her up, throws her over his shoulder, and proudly walks off to get married. Cast * Claudette Colbert as Katherine Grant * Fred MacMurray as Jim Ryan * Ilka Chase as Hoppy Grant * Richard Haydn as Roger Winant * Paul McGrath as Henry Fulton * June Havoc as Darlene * Marjorie Gateson as Sophie * Robert Homans as Pop Murphy (uncredited) * Arthur Loft as Vice-President (uncredited) * Morton Lowry as Dunbar (uncredited) * Philo McCullough as Gold Room Patron (uncredited) * Frank Moran as Erector Tender (uncredited) Production=Screenplay= The screenplay for No Time for Love was written by Claude Binyon, based on a story by Robert Lees and Frederic I. Rinaldo. The Katherine Grant character is based on Margaret Bourke-White, Life magazine's first female photojournalist, whose stylized photos of industrial subjects were featured in Life's premiere issue, initiating a new era of photojournalism. =Casting= Oscar Levant was originally cast for the role of Roger, but when filming was delayed he was forced to withdraw due to other commitments. Rita Hayworth was originally cast as Katherine, but also had to withdraw when production was delayed by eighteen months. Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray were finally cast in the lead roles. They co-starred together in seven films between 1935 and 1948. No Time for Love was their fourth film together. Both actors had worked with director Mitchell Leisen on a number of other films‚ÄîMacMurray made a total of nine films with him, and Colbert four. Colbert also worked with Leisen when he was a costume designer on Cecil B. DeMille's epic film The Sign of the Cross (1932). Leisen would later remember No Time for Love as a \\"happy collaboration\\": Due to the restricted use of film stock during the war years, the actors rehearsed extensively throughout the filming to avoid multiple takes. Many of the scenes that ended up in the film were first takes.Quirk, p. 131. =Filming= Principal photography lasted from June 8 to July 24, 1942. Charles Wall and Edward Sanell from the New York Tunnel Authority served as technical advisors for the film. The New York Tunnel Authority also provided Paramount blueprints for the Brooklyn‚ÄìBattery Tunnel. The film was shot at Paramount Studios at 5555 Melrose Avenue in Hollywood, California. The 25-foot long tunnel set was constructed on Paramount's largest stage, and was filled with mud for the climactic scene. To avoid using real mud, set designers experimented with several combinations of material, eventually using adobe and water. A cement mixer was installed on the set to produce the correct consistency. Leisen later recalled, \\"I never asked the actors to do anything I wouldn't do, so on our first day in the tunnel, I dove right into the mud, head first. I came up and said, 'All right, let's go.'\\" After Colbert's first take in the mud, she emerged without any mud on her face. \\"I said, 'Come here, honey,' and took a handful of the mud and slapped it on her face. She went right back in and did it again.\\" During the war years, austerity measures limited the amount of money producers could spend on construction materials. To stay within budget, Leisen leveraged one of the sets from Colbert's previous film, The Palm Beach Story (1942), which were still standing at Paramount, and transformed it into Colbert's bedroom in No Time for Love. Colbert's dream sequence utilized a minimal set. Critical response In his review for the New York Times, Bosley Crowther called the film a \\"delightful comedy\\" and \\"a thoroughly ingratiating film\\". While the film presents a simple boy-girl plot grounded in the basic law that opposites attract, director Mitchell Leisen is able to fashion an entertaining movie through the \\"clever application of the simple mechanics of the screen\\" and with action that illustrates this elemental theme. Crowther concludes: The reviewer for Variety called it an \\"escapist\\" film that was \\"heavily loaded with laughs\\". The reviewer praised Mitchell Leisen's production and direction, the \\"capital\\" performances of Colbert and MacMurray, and Claude Binyon's screenplay with its \\"sufficiency of crack dialog‚Äîand the laughs that go with it\\". The film's appeal has not wavered much for subsequent generations. In 2009, the film was reissued as part of the Claudette Colbert Collection DVD box set. In his review of the film, Glenn Erickson called it \\"83 fast minutes of very funny comedy\\". He also praised the film for its handling of sex roles. Erickson also praised the impressive tunnel scenes and Katherine's surreal dream sequence, which effectively demonstrates her secret desire to be swept off her feet by a macho he-man and saved from her effete male suitor. Erickson concluded that No Time for Love is \\"both funny and clever at all times\\". Accolades No Time for Love was nominated for the Oscar for Best Art Direction‚ÄìInterior Decoration, Black-and-White (Hans Dreier, Robert Usher, Samuel M. Comer).

The SY77 is a synthesizer whose architecture combines AFM (Advanced Frequency Modulation) synthesis, AWM2 (Advanced Wave Memory 2) for ROM-borne sample-based synthesis, and the combination of these two methods christened Realtime Convolution and Modulation Synthesis (RCM). The same technology was also packaged in a rack-mounted module released simultaneously, the TG77. The SY77 is equipped with a 61-key keyboard with velocity and aftertouch; has a pitch wheel and two modulation wheels (the latter being quite a rare feature among keyboards in general); and has a large backlit LCD display, expansion slots, floppy-drive, on-board effects, and a 16,000 note sequencer. Programming is performed through a keypad on the front panel. When the SY77 was released in late 1989, its initial prices were close to $3000 USD/¬£2000 GBP. In 1991, it was followed by the SY99, a successor that cost ~$4000/¬£3000 and expanded its capabilities with a 76-key keyboard, the ability to load user-specified samples for AWM, a more advanced effects unit, and other features. Synthesis technologies The AFM synthesis of the SY77 is effectively a superset of the 6-operator FM synthesis available on the Yamaha DX7 and DX7 II series of synthesizers. It is capable of all of the sounds that can be produced by those earlier keyboards ‚Äì with various programs being able to automatically translate DX patches intelligently into accurate SY equivalents ‚Äì and many more sounds besides. Among the advantages of AFM synthesis over FM synthesis are: a larger choice of algorithms, 15 additional waves besides the standard sine, which have additional harmonic content; 45 standard algorithms instead of the DX7's 32, plus a new ability to design one's own custom-routed algorithm using MIDI/SysEx; the flexible routing of up to three feedback sources within any algorithm, as opposed to the DX series' fixed algorithms with a single source each; the ability to route the FM signal through a configurable filter with the options of resonance and self- oscillation; and more. The SY/TG series also features Yamaha's now-flagship Advanced Wave Memory 2 (AWM2) technology for playback and manipulation of PCM samples, an evolution of the AWM included earlier in their TX16W. Such waveforms can be used as samples alone; can be layered with FM-based Elements, including using them as transients to FM-synthesized main waveforms, similarly to Roland's LA synthesis; or, in a feature unique to the SY/TG series, can be used as modulators for FM operators in place of elementary signals like the sine wave. These technologies, both alone and in combination (the latter giving rise to the name Realtime Convolution and Modulation), can generate rich, layered, multi-timbral sounds, and there are large libraries of patches available for the SY77. Sound sets on floppy disks are available online with patches and presets ranging from emulations of classic synthesizers and ambient pads, to percussion and organ sounds. A single 720 kB (DD) formatted floppy disk can hold over 400 patches. The TG77 lacks the disk drive but can still load patches and settings via MIDI SysEx. However, software applications exist that can convert previously disk-only and thus SY77-only files into a TG77-compatible format. Legacy The SY/TG range as a whole was discontinued sometime between 1995 and 1997. The SY77 and SY99 were replaced as the flagship Yamaha synthesizer workstations by the W7 and W5, respectively. However, the SY77 and SY99 were the last Yamaha \\"flagship\\" workstations to be natively capable of the fully fledged FM synthesis that had been introduced with the DX line. Yamaha's later FS1r was the most advanced of their FM synthesizers, adding 8-operator synthesis and formant synthesis (hence FS), but it was a rack-mounted module and never received much attention, and so it was discontinued rapidly, with the result that units today are both hard to find and expensive. Some subsequent products by Yamaha included FM to certain extents. The CS6x, Motif, and Motif ES lines can perform FM using the PLG150DX expansion cards, which enable monotimbral voicing with up to 16 notes of polyphony per card. The DX200 is a groovebox-style repackaging of the same expansion card into a table-top chassis with an added drum machine. It has also some basic effects and LP/HP filter with resonance. FM synthesis in PLG100-DX and PLG150-DX is identical to DX7, so in that manner it is less powerful than its predecessors, SY-77/TG-77, SY-99 and FS1R. At NAMM 2016, Yamaha unveiled its newest generation of flagship synthesizers with the MONTAGE, which is a hybrid between the Motif XS/XF engines and a newly designed FM engine called FM-X. It is similar to how the SY77 is a hybrid between two technologies, AWM2 samples and AFM (Advanced FM). The Montage has an AWM2 engine, the same found in the Motif series, With the ability to import custom samples to the internal flashrom like the SY99. The newly designed FM-X synthesis engine is capable of delivering 8 operators in 88 algorithms, each with multiple harmonic waves along the standard sine wave found in FM. It also has the same resonant filters found in contemporary Motif synths, as well as a complex modulation interface that includes an envelope follower, motion sequencer and more. New to the Montage is the ability to process external audio and use it as a modulation source in its FM-X engine.

Based on the novel His Woman by Dale Collins, the story is about a tough sea captain who discovers a baby aboard his freighter and hires a tramp, masquerading as a missionary's daughter, to care for the infant on their passage to New York. The 1931 film was 52nd box-office rank by the year. It is a remake of the 1928 film Sal of Singapore. Plot While docked in a Caribbean port aboard a third-rate freighter, Captain Sam Whalan (Gary Cooper) gets involved in a drunken brawl in a seedy tavern. Returning to the ship, Sam discovers that a baby boy, rescued from a drifting Navy boat, has been left for an unnamed sailor aboard his ship. Deciding to adopt the child himself, Sam advertises for a \\"mother\\" and soon hires Sally Clark (Claudette Colbert) as the child's nanny in exchange for her passage to New York. Sally tells him she is the daughter of a recently deceased missionary. Unknown to Sam, Sally is actually a dance hall girl dressed to appear virtuous and proper. During the voyage, Sally takes loving care of the child while Sam protects her from the lusty sailors on board. One night, the first mate, Gatson (Averell Harris), recognizes Sally from a dance hall and tries to blackmail her into sleeping with him. Sally struggles to reject his advances, and Sam comes to her rescue. In the ensuing struggle, Gatson falls overboard. Unable to locate him in the dense fog, he is assumed dead. By the time they arrive in New York, Sam and Sally have fallen in love and intend to marry. The Department of Commerce, however, calls Sam to testify in an investigation of the Gatson incident, and he is soon arrested. Sam and Sally are surprised to learn that Gatson survived, was picked up by a cruise ship, and is now pressing charges against Sam for assault and attempted murder. In the course of the investigation, in order to clear Sam of the charges, Sally is forced to reveal her sordid past as a dance hall girl. Shocked and disappointed by the revelation, Sam tells Sally to leave the ship, and decides to put the baby up for adoption, despite Sally's sincere protests. After sending his assistant Aloysius (Hamtree Harrington) to deliver Sally's luggage, Sam goes off drinking with Gatson. Later that night, a vengeful Sam brings Gatson to Sally's apartment to insult her. When she learns from another sailor that the baby was left out in the rain and is now sick, she immediately comes to care for the infant with the help of a doctor. Sam postpones his next sailing mission until the child's fever breaks and he begins to recover. By the time the baby is well and the ship pulls up anchor, Sam and Sally have made amends and renew their plans to marry.

The village is part of the administrative partnership Gro√üsch√∂nau-Waltersdorf.  Geography and transportation The community Hainewalde is approximatively 10 km apart from Zittau in the foreland of the Lusatian Mountains. The federal highway 96 passes Hainewalde in the north, the Czech border is approximatively 15 km west of it. The railroad Zittau- Varnsdorf has a station in Hainewalde.  History  Hainewalde was first documentary mentioned in 1272. It is believed that the name is derived from the founder one founder called \\"Hener\\", \\"Heno\\", \\"Hening\\" or \\"Heinrich\\". Settlers of the German feudal east-expansion established Hainewalde as a so- called \\"Waldhufendorf\\", by stubbing the forest along the river Mandau. In 1392 the today's old castle, in these times gate lodge, was built as manor. By the treaty of Prague (1636) Upper Lusatia, and therefore Hainewalde, came under the power of Saxony, which resulted constraints on independence and the freedom of religion. This brought some Bohemian exule around 1650, which increased the local population. From 1749 to 1753, a new castle was built by the Prussian chamberlain von Canitz. Till 1927 Hainewalde was the residence of the old Saxon noble family Kanitz-Kyaw. As a result of the excessive debts of the nobleman, the castle, its ground and forest were sold on 12 March 1927. Since 1928, the castle was under the authority of the neighbouring community of Gro√üsch√∂nau. On 26 March 1933, it was occupied by the Nazi-German stormtroopers from Dresden, which set up a provisional concentration camp for political prisoners. The first prisoners arrived on 28 March 1933. On 10 August 1933, the KZ Hainewalde was closed and served as \\"Wehrert√ºchtigungslager\\" until the end of World War II. Until 1972, it was primarily used as residential house and remained empty since that. A private association founded in 2000 is now working on its preservation.

History=Oil-fired power station= The station was originally planned as a 1320 MWe oil-fired power station consisting of two 676 MWe generating units. Designed by Robert Matthew Johnson Marshall & Partners, construction began in May 1973, with one unit opening in 1980, and the other in 1982. The original owner was the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board. The proximity of the station to St Fergus gas terminal meant, however, that the boilers were converted to burn gas as well as oil. When it opened, it burnt waste gas from the Brent oilfield, before this gas was refined at the Mossmorran refinery near Cowdenbeath, and the price of oil was uneconomic to use. By 1984, the price of oil made it economic to burn. One fatality occurred on 19 June 1982. A machinist was crushed during the failed lift of a large surface grinder. 41 year old Joseph Smith, worked in the machine shop of the oil-fired power station for his full working life. =Gas turbines= In the early 1990s the owners (Scottish Hydro Electric) entered into a contract with BP to burn sour gas from the Miller Field. In order to satisfy the terms of this contract two further units were built (two 120 MW Open Cycle gas turbine) with a primary function to burn Miller gas when the two main units were unavailable. These gas turbines have now been decommissioned and the plant sold to a firm in Africa where they will be used in a de-salination plant. Gas was brought into a new gas reception facility called the \\"PGRF\\". Due to the nature of the gas all carbon steel piping had to comply with NACE Specification MR 01 75 (90) which required limits on sulphur and carbon content. The gas supply line from the PGRF was installed by Motherwell Bridge Projects from 1990 to 1991. The piping system consisted of carbon steel piping ranging from 30\\" to 20\\" fully welded and tested producing a high integrity system. The system feeds both units terminating on the air preheater roof where the main boiler feeds are controlled through a gas header. The header consists of three 14\\" and one 10\\" valve. =Combined cycle gas turbines= In 2000 the station completed a major repowering project to increase the efficiency and capacity of the station. Three gas turbines were utilised in an innovative manner to provide steam to one of the original steam turbines. These changes allowed for 1150 MWe of output to be delivered at 57% thermal efficiency compared with the plant's original 37%. The installed capacity of Peterhead increased to 2407 MWe in November 2007 following a compressor and combustion control upgrade on GT11, 12 and 13 making it the largest power station in Scotland ahead of Longannet. The transmission system at Peterhead however, limits production to 1550 MWe. In May 2009 GT3 and GT4 were decommissioned. The installed capacity of Peterhead is now reduced to 2177 MW. The power station was refurbished during 2015, and returned to service in November 2015. The station is now configured for flexibly and efficiently generating between 240 MWe and 400 MWe, with a Supplemental Balancing Reserve (SBR) contract for an additional 750 MWe to provide occasional back-up over the winter period. The station has secured contracts up to 2021/22 and is scheduled to produce 1.05GW in 2019/20 and 1.06GW in 2020/21.https://sse.com/newsandviews/allarticles/2019/08/peterhead-secures- capacity-contracts-in-rwe-transfer/ =Hydrogen power plant= In 2006 there were plans to produce 350 MWe of power from hydrogen produced from methane, with the resulting carbon dioxide being pumped into the Miller Field by BP using carbon capture. It would have been the first large scale hydrogen power plant. On 23 May 2007, BP pulled the plug on the carbon capture idea after losing patience waiting for government approval, with concern over the long term storage capacity of the Miller Field. Specification The three 277 MWe V94.3A (now called SGT5-4000F) Siemens gas turbines provide a CCGT-type system of power generation, with three Doosan Babcock heat recovery steam generators providing steam to one (older) steam turbine.

It is known for releasing albums by punk, garage rock, and more recently post-punk and synth-oriented bands, such as the King Khan & BBQ Show, Nots, Low Life, and the late Jay Reatard. The label also hosts Gonerfest, an annual Memphis music festival. Record label The Goner Records label was started in 1993 by Eric Friedl. While attending the second Garage Shock festival, Friedl saw a performance by Japanese garage punk band Guitar Wolf, becoming a fan. After Guitar Wolf's performance, Friedl approached the band, receiving some demo cassettes in exchange for agreeing to set up some further Guitar Wolf shows in Memphis. Based on the supplied demos, Friedl decided to release Guitar Wolf's first album, Wolf Rock!, calling the band in Japan for permission. Friedl followed this first release with a number of releases by his own band, the Oblivians. Since its inception, a growing number of bands have released albums through Goner, including LPs by the Bad Times, the Oblivians, King Louie Bankston, The King Khan & BBQ Show, Digital Leather, Box Elders, Harlan T. Bobo, The Reigning Sound, Nots, and The Leather Uppers. Goner has also had a hand in releasing a multitude of 7\\" singles. Record store In 2004, Friedl and business partner Zac Ives (frontman of the band The Final Solutions) purchased a record store to accompany the Goner Records label. The Goner Records store is located at 2152 Young Avenue, in Memphis, Tenn., at the former location of Legba Records, an independent music store formerly operated by Reigning Sound frontman Greg Cartwright. The store itself sells music in a variety of formats including LP, CD, 45 and 78. The store also contains a 25 cent trip through the \\"Elvis Impersonator Shrine.\\" Goner Fest In 2004, Friedl founded Goner Fest, which has become a yearly event in Memphis for showcasing Goner-related bands. The first Goner Fest was held in January 2005 and consisted of three nights of live music performed mostly at the local Buccaneer Tavern. The second Goner Fest was held just nine months later. The third Goner fest took place in 2006 at the Hi-Tone, a venue famous for housing Elvis Presley's kung fu dojo in the 1970s.

He paid for the rent of a large auction room in Aungier Street for the use in communion and prayer on the Lord's day (Sunday). He thought that the Lord's table should be a public witness of the Brethren's position. Aungier Street was the first public meeting room for the movement that became known as Plymouth Brethren and they commenced celebrating Lord's supper (the Breaking of Bread) in the spring of 1830.Carter, G., Anglican Evangelicals: Protestant Secessions from the Via Media, c. 1800‚Äì1850, pp. 199‚Äì200, Oxford University Press, 2001, When he moved to London he lived at Welbeck Street, London,Coad, F.

Parnell went in September 1830 to Baghdad in the Ottoman Empire with his brother in law Edward Cronin and Dr John Kitto to visit Anthony Norris Groves. The party went with books, medicine and a printing press and arrived in June 1831.

It was founded in 1979 and is headquartered in Washington, DC. The chamber promotes the economic growth and development of entrepreneurs and represents the interests of nearly 4.7 million Hispanic owned businesses in the US that contribute in excess of $700 billion to the American economy. It serves as the umbrella organization for more than 250 local chambers and business associations in the United States and Puerto Rico. Additionally, it advocates for the 259 major American companies who are its supporting members. The association is bipartisan. It regularly invites public officials and political candidates from both sides of the aisle to present to its members.  Studies  In September 2015, the chamber and the business intelligence firm, Geoscape, released a study showing that Hispanic businesses grew at an annual rate of 7.5% between 2012 and 2015, \\"which is 15 times faster than the .5% percent growth rate for all companies.\\" Since 2007, the number of Hispanic-owned businesses increased by 57% to 4.07 million, and revenues at these companies grew by 88% to roughly $660 billion.  Annual National Convention  Each year, the chamber hosts its national convention and business expo. This is the country's largest networking venue for Hispanic businesses and Fortune 1000 corporations interested in the Hispanic market. The four-day convention affords Hispanic vendors and corporate buyers the opportunity to establish partnerships; provides sessions and discussions about business development, chamber training, innovative trends and solutions; and focuses on current issues that impact the Hispanic entrepreneur. The 2015 convention, held in Houston, TX, had 6,000 people in attendance.  Annual Legislative Summit  Each year during the session of the United States Congress, the chamber hosts its annual Legislative Summit. The summit provides chamber members, Hispanic business leaders, and corporate executives the opportunity to discuss legislative policy issues that impact the small business community. Hispanic chamber executives also use the opportunity to meet with their Congressional representatives. In addition, every two years, the chamber issues its Legislative Policy and Priorities to the White House and Congress.  Voter registration  In September 2016 the chamber started a Guac the Vote campaign to use taco trucks to register voters and to appear at polling stations on election day. The campaign name is a reference to guacamole.

Descriptions The term buy-write is used because the investor 'buys' stocks and 'writes' call options against the stock position. The writing of the call option provides extra income for an investor who is willing to forgo some upside potential. The BXD Index is designed to show the hypothetical performance of a strategy in which an investor buys a portfolio of the 30 stocks in the DJIA, and also sells (or writes) covered call options on the DJIA Index. History Investors have used exchange-listed options to engage in buy-write strategies since the 1970s, but prior to 2002 there was no major benchmark for buy-write strategies. In 2000 and 2001, options portfolio managers requested that the Chicago Board Options Exchange develop benchmark indexes for buy-write strategies. The CBOE S&P; 500 BuyWrite Index (BXM) was introduced in 2002, and the CBOE DJIA BuyWrite Index (BXD) was introduced in 2005. Investors have used covered call strategies for more than three decades. As noted in a magazine article ‚ÄúBuy Writing Makes Comeback as Way to Hedge Risk.‚Äù Pensions & Investments, (May 16, 2005), two developments have enhanced the interest in covered call strategies in recent years: (1) in 2002 the Chicago Board Options Exchange introduced the first major benchmark index for covered call strategies, the CBOE S&P; 500 BuyWrite Index (ticker BXM), and (2) in 2004 the Ibbotson Associates consulting firm published a case study on buy-write strategies. More than forty new buy-write investment products have been introduced since mid-2004 (see examples below).

Published Studies by Consulting Firms on the Buywrite Strategy In 2007 Fund Evaluation Group (FEG) issued a study entitled \\"Evaluation of BuyWrite and Volatility Indexes‚ÄîUsing the CBOE DJIA BuyWrite Index (BXD) and the CBOE DJIA Volatility Index (VXD) for Asset Allocation and Diversification Purposes.\\" The paper studied the 109-month period from October 1997 to November 2006. The FEG study presented several findings on the 9-year performance of the BXD Index, including: *Income Generation. Selling index options 12 times per year can produce significant income. Over the 109-month period studied, the average monthly options premium received was 1.84%, or an annualized rate of 24.46%. *Diversification and Reduced Volatility. The volatility of the BXD was 25% less than that of the DJIA and 46% lower than the Russell 2000. The study found that if an investor had allocated 25% of an otherwise all-stock portfolio to the BXD, the portfolio volatility would have declined by about 9%. *Improved Risk-Adjusted Returns. Incorporating a 10% allocation to the BXD could have improved the risk-adjusted returns (as measured by the Sharpe ratio) of all four comparative portfolios studied (i.e., all-stocks, all fixed income, aggressive and conservative portfolios). In 2006 Callan Associates published A Review of the CBOE S&P; 500 BuyWrite Index. In 2004 Ibbotson Associates published a case study on buywrite strategies.

The title Beresina refers to the Beresinalied, a patriotic song used as the code for initiating the putsch. The film is a black comedy where all aspects of Swiss life are satirized in anecdotes.

It is believed to be a cluster of hot massive stars, possibly containing an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) at its centre. GCIRS 13E was first identified as GCIRS 13, which was later resolved into two components GCIRS13E and W. GCIRS 13E was initially modelled as a single object, possibly a binary system. It was even classified as a Wolf-Rayet star because of its strong emission line spectrum, and named WR 101f. It was then resolved into seven Wolf-Rayet and class O stars. The highest-resolution infrared imaging and spectroscopy can now identify 19 objects in GCIRS 13E, of which 15 are dense gaseous regions. The remaining four objects are stars: WN8 and WC9 Wolf-Rayet stars; an OB supergiant; and a K3 giant. The motions of the members of GCIRS 13E appear to indicate a much higher mass than can be accounted for by the visible objects. It has been proposed that there may be an intermediate-mass black hole with a mass of about at its centre. There are a number of problems with this theory. However, the true nature of the cluster remains unknown. GCIRS 13E is a small cluster dominated by a few massive stars. It is thought that massive stars cannot form so close to a supermassive black hole and since such massive stars have a short lifespan it is thought that GCIRS 13E must have migrated inward toward the central black hole within the past 10 million years, probably from about 60 light-years further out than its current orbit. The stars are possibly the remains of a globular cluster where a middleweight black hole such as could develop through runaway star collisions.

Another song, \\"Impeach the President\\", which he recorded and produced with a high school group, the Honey Drippers, has had one of the most sampled drum tracks in hip hop music. Life and career Roy Hammond was born in Newington, Georgia. He began singing tenor with The Genies, a vocal group in Long Beach, Long Island, who were later offered a recording contract by record producer Bob Shad. Their first single, \\"Who's That Knockin'\\", reached number 72 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1958, with Claude Johnson‚Äîlater of the duo Don and Juan‚Äîon lead vocal. The group then moved to Atlantic Records, with Hammond taking over as lead singer, but their recordings were not released, and he was drafted into the Air Force. =Solo career and record labels= When he returned to New York City in 1965, Hammond organised a studio session to record his own song, \\"Shotgun Wedding\\", and released it under the name Roy Hammond on his own Hammond label, before leasing it to the larger Black Hawk Records under the name Roy C. The record, with its novelty ricochet opening and subject matter that was relatively risqu√© for the time, reached number 14 on the national Billboard R&B; chart. It had even greater success when issued in the United Kingdom, reaching number 6 on the UK Singles Chart in 1966 and number 8 when reissued in 1972. His first album, That Shotgun Wedding Man, was released on Ember Records in 1966. After some unsuccessful follow-ups on the Shout label, Hammond started another new label, Alaga. Working with guitarist J. Hines, he had more success with \\"Got to Get Enough (Of Your Sweet Love Stuff)\\" making the R&B; charts in 1971. Two years later he signed with Mercury Records, and had another R&B; hit with \\"Don't Blame the Man\\". He also released an album, Sex and Soul, and several more minor hit singles. He stayed with Mercury for several years, until label bosses took exception to his outspoken political stance in songs, including \\"Great Great Grandson of a Slave\\" from his 1977 album More Sex and More Soul. Reviewing Sex and Soul in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau wrote, \\"Roy Hammond is a driven artist‚Äîhe cut this in his garage‚Äîand his compulsiveness comes out in the lyrics; despite convincing asides about racism and Vietnam, his title ought to be Infidelity and Suffering. The songs are raw and outspoken, and the suffering's in the voice even more than the words‚Äîhe strains its paradoxically mellow limits sometimes, so seekers after the Perfect Note should seek elsewhere. But old Swamp Dogg fans will put aside their feminist reservations and learn how the other half lives.\\" =The Honey Drippers= In 1973, Hammond discovered a group of African-American high school students from Jamaica High School in Jamaica, Queens, named the Honey Drippers (not to be confused with Robert Plant's project of the same name), and decided to record some songs with them, which he released on his Alaga label. Most notable among the songs they recorded was \\"Impeach the President\\", a song advocating for the impeachment of President Richard Nixon due to the ongoing Watergate scandal and resulting impeachment process against Richard Nixon. Sampling of \\"Impeach the President\\" Pioneering hip hop producer Marley Marl used the drum intro from \\"Impeach the President\\" as the breakbeat for the 1985 song \\"The Bridge\\" by MC Shan. The opening drum sequence has since become one of the most widely used samples in hip hop. American rapper GZA makes a reference to the \\"Impeach the President\\" sample on his verse on \\"As High as Wu-Tang Get\\" by Wu-Tang Clan on the 1997 album Wu-Tang Forever, with the suggestion that the snare drum in the sample is easy to rap over. (\\"You can't flow, must be the speech impediment / You got lost off the snare off 'Impeach the President.'\\") In 1992, Aaron Fuchs, president of Tuff City Records, bought the rights to \\"Impeach the President\\", and soon afterward sued Def Jam Records for royalties from its use on three then-recently released songs: \\"Around the Way Girl\\" and \\"6 Minutes of Pleasure\\" by LL Cool J, and \\"Give the People\\" by EPMD, which used a vocal sample from the song and not the drum track. By this time Ronny Jordan was using the sample on his first two albums. The lawsuits were settled out-of-court. Hammond was unaware of the widespread sampling of \\"Impeach the President\\" until he heard it used in both \\"That's the Way Love Goes\\" by Janet Jackson and \\"Luv Me, Luv Me\\" by Shaggy. Even George Benson sampled the beat on his 1996 track \\"The Thinker\\" from the album That's Right. In a 2013 interview he stated that he has never received royalties from the sampling, and that he was still trying to do so. Hammond also alleges that Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI) removed several songs from his publishing catalog based on fraudulent contracts presented by Fuchs, and as a result Hammond has received no royalties from them. Hammond's website includes a notice encouraging those who have been sued by Fuchs or any of his record labels to contact Hammond. Hammond has occasionally been credited as a co- writer due to the sample, including on the hit Mary J. Blige song \\"Real Love\\", which samples the drum track from \\"Top Billin'\\" by Audio Two, which in turn uses a modified form of the drum intro from \\"Impeach the President\\". He is also credited for the 2011 Kanye West and Jay-Z song \\"Otis\\", which uses a line from \\"Top Billin'\\", and for the 2013 Frank Ocean song \\"Super Rich Kids\\", which interpolates the chorus of \\"Real Love\\". Neither \\"Otis\\" nor \\"Super Rich Kids\\" contain a sample from \\"Impeach the President\\". =Later career= From 1979 he continued to release a string of soul singles and albums, on his own Three Gems record label, initially based in New York and later in Allendale, South Carolina. Hammond wrote most of the songs that appear on his over 125 records. He recorded an album by ex-Temptation Dennis Edwards entitled Talk to Me, and also worked on a CD by Bobby Stringer. Hammond also ran his own record shop in Allendale, called Carolina Record Distributors. \\"Infidelity, Georgia,\\" also known as \\"Save by the Bell\\" or \\"Saved by the Bell,\\" is a song about sexual infidelity in small town Georgia. Hammond released an album entitled Stella Lost Her Groove in March 1999.

Official website of the Huallanca District The district was founded in 1950 by separating it from the Huaylas District. Railroad construction At the height of regional mining production in 1860, the national and local governments sought to facilitate exports from mines in the Callej√≥n de Huaylas (the grand valley \\"Alley of Huaylas\\") through the port of Chimbote. This initiative included the construction of a 29 km railroad between Chimbote and Huallanca, an extension of the proposed Chimbote-Chuquicara-Recuay railway. The project was approved by law on 8 November 1864. Construction was entrusted to Ing. Enrrique Meiggs during the administration of Peruvian president Jos√© Balta, and began on 9 June 1871. The work was done in three stages, the first of which was from Chimbote to Planks, inaugurated in 1877. The second stage, from Planks to Chuquicara, was inaugurated in 1892 by means of a contract with the Peruvian Pacific Railway. In 1920 the third stage, from Chuquicara to Huallanca, was begun. Overall length of the rail line from Chimbote to Huallanca was 137 km. Later a planned 13.5 km extension advanced on a roadbed constructed without sleepers or rails.

Its headwaters are on the western flanks of the Andes of the Parinacota Province, just a few kilometers south of the border with Peru, and empties into the Pacific Ocean about 4 km north of the city of Arica. Course The Lluta originates at the confluence of the Quebrada Caracarani (which rises from the slopes of the Tacora volcano) and the Azufre River, at an elevation about 3,900 m asl. Along its first 36 km, the river flows southeast and then slowly begins to turn towards the west. In its descent to the lower elevations of the valley, the river starts to run through a canyon carved by the same river in rhyolite tuffs and other sediments scarcely joined. In the vicinity of Socoroma, the river turns directly west and just past the canyon terminus, the river begins to widen. In Chironta, about 70 km from the sea, appear the first farms, whose foods are of a great importance for the consume of local people. Finally, the river empties into Pacific Ocean at an extensive beach, just a few kilometers north of Arica. The hydrologic regime of the river basin is rain-dominated. The increase of its water volume occurs mainly in January and February, as a consequence of the phenomenon known as Bolivian Winter. Under the Chilean proposal of 1975 to resolve the Atacama border dispute, the Lluta River would have become the northern border of Chile, and Bolivia would control the narrow strip between the river and the southern border of Peru. Water quality Apart from its problems of salinity and acidity, the river has very elevated levels of boron, arsenic, and sulfate, among other pollutants, which restricts the agricultural activities that can be developed along the river banks. The river water is used only for irrigation of pastureland and crops which tolerate poor water quality, such as onions and potatoes.

The Beaux Arts style building has 1,500 seats, and went on to host silent movies, ‚Äútalkies,‚Äù live music and a range of other shows. In 1983, the Orpheum was scheduled for demolition but was acquired by the New Orleans Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra, and underwent a $3 million renovation. It served as the orchestra's home theater until the orchestra's financial demise in 1991. Under new ownership, the Orpheum became the home of the newly formed Louisiana Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO), whose musicians prized the auditorium for its acoustical purity.New Orleans Times-Picayune, July 7, 2006, p. 1 The theater is an example of \\"vertical hall\\" construction, initially built to provide perfect sight lines and acoustics for vaudeville shows which didn't have the benefit of amplifiers or modern lighting.

The theater was purchased in February 2014 by Dr. Eric George, who completed a $13 million renovation. Renovations included installing a new hydraulic floor that can be lifted and lowered to create sloped or flat footing, which allows it to accommodate concerts and events. Additionally, the upgrade included an expanded marble lobby, enlarged seating, additional bathrooms, multiple bars. George and his investment company, ERG Enterprises, completed a subsequent renovation in 2020 by opening a speakeasy bar in the basement of the theater. The venue, called the Double Dealer, opened January 24, 2020. The theater reopened in August 2015. The first event was held on September 17, 2015 with a performance by the Louisiana Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO). The LPO has since become the anchor tenant for the theater.

In life, they would have resembled a long-tailed muntjac or chevrotain. Dichobunids had four or five toes on each foot, with each toe ending in a small hoof. They had complete sets of teeth, unlike most later artiodactyls, with their more specialist dentitions. The shape of the teeth suggests they were browsers, feeding on small leaves, perhaps in the forest undergrowth.

Film historian James H. Farmer described Skylark as \\"light-hearted fluff\\" with the story of a woman on her fifth wedding anniversary, realizing that she is fed up with always coming in second to her husband's advertising business. Just at that moment, she meets a handsome attorney, and their innocent flirtation begins to turn into something more serious.Farmer 1984, p. 326. Plot On their fifth wedding anniversary, Lydia Kenyon (Claudette Colbert) feels she is neglected and treated insensitively by her husband, Tony (Ray Milland). He is very committed to his job as an advertising executive, and not only does it take up his time, but it requires a lot of less than desirable socializing with his clients. When Lydia finds out that Tony has sent his friend, George Gorell (Walter Abel), to select a fifth wedding anniversary gift for her. Lydia treats Tony's lack of sensitivity with humor, but when Tony, one of their parties, \\"gives\\" their cook to his client's wife, the snooty Mrs. Myrtle Vantine (Binnie Barnes), Lydia becomes furious. Storming out of the party in the company of Jim Blake (Brian Aherne), a lawyer, who takes a frustrated Lydia off on a moonlight drive.

He forces her to make an apology to Mrs. Vantine for causing a scene. Unbeknownst to Lydia, Jim has been carrying on an affair with Mrs. Vantine. Embarrassed and angry, Lydia asks Jim to start divorce proceedings. Tony reacts, by claiming he will quit his job so that they can be together. Shortly after, however, Mrs. Vantine surprises Lydia with a visit and threatens to fire Tony if Lydia does not stop seeing Jim. Lydia explodes, insulting Mrs. Vantine, calling her a tramp and a \\"scheming cow.\\" When Lydia discovers that Tony lied about quitting his job, she is granted a \\"Reno divorce\\", and begins seeing Jim seriously. Jim, in turn, has fallen in love with Lydia. Tony refuses to accept the divorce and, since having lost his job, he takes a government job in South America hoping Lydia will come to him there.

Plot When a young pilot, Daniel Bellamy, is presumed dead after crashbombing an enemy aircraft carrier, the footage of the crash and his presumably final reminiscence of walking in the park with 'Piggy' and kissing her on the nose is sent back home. A typographical error in transcribing his words becomes a tribute to heroism, while a girl who worked in his office, Peggy, is thought to be the object of his secret love. However, Dan returns home and in order to save embarrassment for both the girl and himself, he tries to keep up the pretense. Dan reveals that he was not speaking of a girl, but in fact he meant his dog. A series of comical mishaps ensue, leading to resolution of the misunderstanding. The resolution, however, is long coming. Cast *Claudette Colbert as Peggy Martin *Fred MacMurray as Daniel Bellamy *Gil Lamb as Albert W. Beagell *Cecil Kellaway as Marvin P.

George Ignacio Mira (born January 11, 1942) is a former professional American football player, a quarterback in eight National Football League (NFL) seasons for four teams. He then played five seasons in the Canadian Football League and World Football League. Early years Born and raised in Key West, Florida, Mira graduated from Key West High School in 1960. He played college football at the University of Miami under head coach Andy Gustafson. One of the best games in Mira's collegiate career came as a junior in 1962 in the Gotham Bowl against the Nebraska Cornhuskers. Despite playing in weather in front of fewer than a thousand fans at Yankee Stadium, Mira threw for 321 yards, a Miami school record at the time, and was named the bowl game's most valuable player. Despite Mira's efforts, the Cornhuskers won by two points, 36‚Äì34. The previous year, the Hurricanes lost by a point to Syracuse in the Liberty Bowl. Mira (r) in 2018 autographs a copy of the Sports Illustrated feature \\"One Wonderful Conch is this Mira.\\" At the start of the 1963 season Mira was the cover story for Sports Illustrated's college preview issue. The article, written by Key West native John Underwood, was titled \\"One Wonderful Conch is this Mira,\\" and featured many anecdotes about Mira's life growing up and becoming a star on the small island. Playing career Mira was selected in the second round of the 1964 NFL draft, fifteenth overall, by the San Francisco 49ers. Primarily a reserve, he played for eight NFL seasons, 1964 through 1971, for the 49ers, Philadelphia Eagles, Baltimore Colts, and Miami Dolphins. He was a backup to John Brodie in San Francisco and to Bob Griese in Super Bowl VI as a member of the 1971 Dolphins. With the 49ers in 1964, he threw a pass to Billy Kilmer that Kilmer eventually fumbled; the fumble would be recovered by Minnesota Vikings defensive end Jim Marshall, who infamously ran 66 yards in the wrong direction. Mira signed a multi-year contract with the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League (CFL) in August 1972, completing 92 of 168 passes for 1356 yards and 11 touchdowns and eight interceptions in 1973. With the Birmingham Americans of the new World Football League (WFL) in 1974, he was MVP of their championship game victory, completing 155 of 313 passes for 2,248 yards and 17 touchdowns and 14 interceptions during the season. Despite the success on the field, the Birmingham franchise folded in March. In 1975, with the Jacksonville Express of the WFL, he completed 123 of 254 passes for 1,675 yards and 12 touchdowns and interceptions. The league would cease operations late in the 1975 season. Mira finished his career in 1977, playing six games for the Toronto Argonauts as a player-coach. After football Mira returned to Florida and now operates the Native Conch, a food concession at Fairchild Botanical Gardens in Coral Gables. http://osocarrasfood.blogspot.ca/2012/04/native-conch-fairchild- botanical.html For many years he owned a Key West restaurant called George Mira's Pizza Huddle, located across the street from the junior league baseball fields where it became a haven for post-game celebrations.

It includes shops, banking facilities, casinos, cinemas, restaurants, a marina and a five star hotel (Le Labourdonnais).  History  The name of Le Caudan Waterfront comes from a famous figure of the past, Jean Dominique Michel de Caudan, who came to former Isle de France from Languedoc (a historical province in the South of France). He started a saltpan in 1726, close to a small bay in the southwest of Port-Louis. This area, now known as the Robert Edward Hart Garden, is situated on the entrance road to Le Caudan Waterfront. A historical site, the peninsula called Le Caudan was created around a fossil coral islet, hosting a powder magazine, an astronomic and meteorological observatory, quays, warehouses and various small enterprises over the last 250 years. The daily routine of this popular harbor followed the pace of the sugar industry until the creation of the Bulk Sugar Terminal in 1980. From these 150 years of millions of sugar bags transiting by boat, train or trucks, carried by hundreds of hands, only a few old walls still stand today to speak to the mind. Several popular spots of Le Caudan Waterfront bear a strong historical significance. The first meteorological observatory of the Indian Ocean now hosts the Food Court and the Namast√© restaurant. The building hosting the Blue Penny Museum was the former Docks office. The appellations of the different wings of the complex are indeed reminiscent of episodes of the country's colonial history: ‚Ä¢ The main building, known as Barkly Wharf, was named after Sir Henry Barkly, Member of Parliament of the British government and appointed governor of Mauritius from 1863-1870. ‚Ä¢ Le Pavillon wing: an ancient map of Port Louis reveals the existence of Pavillon Street exactly where the Pedestrian Alley of Le Caudan is now located. It is speculated that the origin of this appellation might date back to the period when Port Louis was called ‚ÄòPort Napol√©on‚Äô. ‚Ä¢ Dias Pier, the most recent wing of Le Caudan Waterfront, is a tribute to Diogo Dias, brother of the famous navigator Barthoulomeu Dias. Based on some historical evidence, it is believed that Diogo Dias was the first to record the Mascarene Islands, which include Mauritius, on a navigation map.  Modern Day  Caudan, as it is now commonly known, was the first major shopping development of its kind on the island of Mauritius. It remains to this day an iconic shopping destination for locals and tourists alike. In the mall, visitors will find the latest fashion shops and trends, a popular arts and craft market, known as the Craft Market, Specialty shops selling unique local goods such as replica ships, Indian garments, locally fabricated jewelry or art paintings from local artists. The shopping center also boasts cinemas, a marina, a bookstore, restaurants and cafes, a museum, hosting two of the rarest stamps in the world, a casino and tax free shopping options for tourists. Although being the first shopping mall on the island, Caudan has been able to keep up with the trends and maintains its allure as a modern waterfront mall. From its premises, visitors can also admire the workings going in the port as large container and cruise ships make their way in and out. The Caudan Arts Centre is the next stage of Caudan's development. It will host plays, operas, and conferences during the day and be a game changer for Mauritius. The centre is scheduled to open in December 2018 with a game changing talent competition, Caudan Live.

It is a long green parrot with black lores, and a turquoise crown. Males have red beaks, and females are gray-brown. The singing is high pitched and more protracted as compared to similar species, such as great-billed parrot.Tanygnathus gramineus The bird is rare and either fully or partly nocturnal, and therefore is poorly described. It was first reported in the scientific literature by the Dutch ornithologist Hendrik Cornelis Siebers (1890‚Äì1949) in 1930. The bird predominantly occupies the central, more elevated part of the island, where it was reported at the settlements of Gunung Tagalago, Wa Temun and Kunturun at elevations of 700‚Äì1100 meters (2,300‚Äì3,000 ft), as well on the southern lowlands at Fakal, Ehu and Leksula. There was one observation of these parrots near the Kayeli Bay at the eastern shores of Buru. More recent observations were made off the northern (Waflia) and northwestern (Wamlana) shores. The voice of the black-lored parrot was frequently heard at Kunturun, mostly 1‚Äì7 hours after the sunset, where the locals called the bird \\"kakatua ol‚Äôbiru\\", meaning blue-headed parrot. However, it was caught during the day with slingshots in fruit trees suggesting that its activity is not purely nocturnal. Migration is relatively weak and there are only few reports of the parrots flying up and down hill at high altitudes overnight, as judged from their voices. The population density of black-lored parrot is estimated as 1.3‚Äì19 birds/km¬≤. These birds apparently favor high-altitude forests which on Buru have areas of 1,789 km¬≤ above 900 m, and 872 km¬≤ above 1,200 m. Those forests are relatively untouched by logging which affects coastal areas. Hunting or capturing of these birds by locals is rather limited, and there is only one report of the locals selling a captured black-lored parrot at a market of the nearby Ambon Island in 1998.Black-lored Parrot , Hokkaido Institute of Environmental Sciences and Japan Science and Technology Agency Nevertheless, owing to the small habitat, the species were listed as vulnerable since 1994 by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The establishment of two protected areas on Buru, Gunung Kapalat Mada (1,380 km¬≤) and Waeapo (50 km¬≤), are partly aimed at preserving the habitat of the black-lored parrot.

It was designed by NPP Zvezda. Development began in 1967, concurrently with the Orlan suit for microgravity spacewalks. The developmental model was known simply as Krechet. Design features Weighing 90 kg (198 lb), the suit could operate for 10 hours before requiring a resupply of consumables, and had a total operating lifetime of 48 hours. The Krechet was the first semi-rigid space suit ever developed, with an aluminum alloy hard upper torso and soft fabric limbs. This design was later adopted by the American EMU and later Russian suits. The Krechet included waist and hip joints which were not present in the Orlan. The shoulders and wrists of the suit included ball-bearing joints, which allowed for almost 360 degree rotation. The Krechet was a rear-entry suit, meaning that cosmonauts would enter the suit through a hatch in the back. This entry was easier and more reliable than the use of a zipper. The hatch could then be opened by means of a lever by the right elbow. The life support backpack was incorporated into the hatch. The rear-entry hatch concept is attributed to Zvezda engineer Anatoli Stoklitskii. The suit featured a chest-mounted control and instrument panel which could fold out for use or fold flat against the chest when not needed. The suit also featured a metal \\"hula hoop\\" ring on the back, which would allow a solo cosmonaut who fell on his back to roll onto his side and use his arms and legs to stand. The suit had two snap-down visors, providing differing levels of sun protection, in addition to a clear visor. The outer visor was coated in gold for reflectivity. The suit was designed to be worn over a liquid cooling garment. The inner fabric of the suit was gray nylon canvas. The suit was insulated with waffle-textured foil. The outer layer was an off-white satin-weave fabric with orange trim. Because of constraints in shoulder and elbow mobility in the Krechet, the Soviet lunar lander featured a \\"finger controller\\" which allowed a suited pilot to operate the lander. The Krechet would have served as a microgravity suit as well as a surface suit, as the Soviet lunar lander (LK) and command module (LOK) were not designed for intravehicular crew transfer.

DeGraff of Syracuse, New York, 1867‚Äì69, the Whipple Cast and Wrought Iron Bowstring Truss Bridge over Norman's Kill in Albany, New York, is a very well preserved example of a Whipple Bowstring Arch Truss, still in daily use, with no posted weight limits. Due to the sleek appearance, many users think it is a modern bridge. (The Delaware Turnpike once ran through both neighborhoods until 1929 with the construction of a new much higher, longer, and wider Delaware Avenue Bridge over the Normans Kill. This allowed commuters to and from Albany to bypass both Normansvilles. The original Whipple Bowstring bridge still stands, though it has been closed to vehicular traffic since January 1990.) His patented designs were implemented in numerous bridges, both Whipple truss and prefabricated bowstring arch truss bridges, which became the standard design for Erie Canal crossings; using an economical mix of wrought iron for tension members and cast iron in compression. Another such arch is the Shaw Bridge, the only known Whipple bowstring at its original location and the only known \\"double\\" believed extant, the only \\"a structure of outstanding importance to the history of American engineering and transportation technology.\\" (includes map and diagrams) There are at least four other Whipple bowstrings standing in Central New York state, and one in Newark, Ohio.

The \\"nose up attitude\\" necessary to maintain approximately level flight at the shown phase of the maneuver is clearly visible. Note the aileron deflection on the right wing Diagram of how an aileron roll is performed in relation to other common rolls. The aileron roll is an aerobatic maneuver in which an aircraft does a full 360¬∞ revolution about its longitudinal axis. When executed properly, there is no appreciable change in altitude and the aircraft exits the maneuver on the same heading as it entered. This is commonly one of the first maneuvers taught in basic aerobatics courses. The aileron roll is commonly confused with a barrel roll. Execution The aileron roll is commonly executed through the application of full aileron in one direction. In some lower powered general aviation and aerobatic training aircraft, prior to applying aileron input, the pilot must begin the maneuver by trading altitude for airspeed (i.e. diving). This helps achieve enough airspeed to complete the roll without losing rudder and aileron control. The minimum airspeed needed depends on the aircraft's design, but is generally about 120 to 200 knots. Because full aileron is applied, structural limitations prevent many aircraft from performing the maneuver at very high speeds. Starting from level flight, the pilot pitches the aircraft up about 10 to 30 degrees above the horizon, into a brief climb. The purpose of pitch-up is twofold. This causes an increase in altitude which minimizes altitude loss and airspeed gain. As the aircraft begins to roll, it starts to lose lift. When the wings are vertical, the only lift generated is a small amount from the fuselage, and the aircraft will begin to lose altitude. The brief climb compensates for the loss, allowing the aircraft to complete the roll at the same altitude the maneuver began. When the aircraft is completely inverted, the increased pitch results in greater angle of attack, enabling the inverted wing to generate lift. After the initial pitch-up, the pilot places the elevators in the neutral position. Failure to do this will cause the aircraft to continue pitching up during the upright part of the maneuver, and downward in the inverted part, resulting in something resembling a barrel roll. The pilot then applies full aileron, accomplished by moving the stick to either the right or left. As the aircraft rolls about its longitudinal axis, the nose will begin to drop. Upon completing the roll, the nose will usually be 10 to 30 degrees below the horizon, so the pilot will need to pitch-up to return to level flight. An aileron roll is an unbalanced maneuver. As the roll begins, the aircraft will have a tendency to yaw away from the angle of bank, referred to as \\"adverse yaw.\\" The pilot will usually need to apply the rudder in the direction of the bank to keep the aircraft balanced. An aircraft performing an aileron roll will actually fly along a slightly helical path, and a very light, positive g force will be maintained. An aileron roll is similar to the slow roll, and the two maneuvers are often confused with each other. However, unlike a slow roll, an aileron roll is performed at the maximum roll rate, and is uncontrolled in the pitch axis. It consists of a constant attitude change during the maneuver; from the initial pitch-up to the plane following a slight corkscrew path as the nose drops, followed by the final pitch-up. If the pilot picks a reference point on the horizon, directly ahead of the plane, the nose will actually appear to trace a shape similar to the letter \\"D\\" above this reference point.http://www.iacusn.org/schools/reprints/07june_stowell.pdf Uses The aileron roll is commonly used in air shows and aerial combat training. The use of the pure aileron roll in air combat is contentious, but many common maneuvers bear heavy dependence on the aileron roll. Examples of this are the Immelmann turn, barrel roll, and Split S. An aileron roll carried out by a pilot as a sign of victory or celebration is known as a victory roll. Test pilots commonly employ the aileron roll to evaluate an aircraft's turning characteristics (e.g. time to turn).

It is administered by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. The park opened on April 15, 1976 and is named after Thomas F. McKinney, a businessman, race horse breeder and rancher, who owned and lived on the land in the mid-to-late 19th century. The park is part of the El Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail. Pre- history During the Cretaceous Period through the early Paleogene Period, much of Texas was covered by a shallow subtropical sea. The calcium carbonate sediments deposited during this period lithified into the limestone rock underneath the park's soil and was exposed by erosion around the creek bed. Aquatic reptiles swam in the sea as evidenced by a complete skeleton of a mosasaur found in the rocks of Onion Creek not far from the park. In the park, shells of extinct sea animals such as species of Inoceramus and Exogyra are preserved in the limestone.Raney, Jay A. Down to Earth at McKinney Falls State Park, Texas. Bureau of Economic Geology. 1997. p3. A volcano, now long extinct and called \\"Pilot Knob,\\" spewed debris into the surrounding sea. The streams of soft volcanic debris eroded faster than the hard limestone. The removal of the softer layers and undercutting of the limestone by the water led the falls to be formed over millions of years. There is evidence that hunter-gatherers occupied the land that is now McKinney Falls State Park at least five thousand years ago, maybe more. The tribes found water in the creek and protection among the rock shelters created by the same undercutting action that formed the falls. History Thomas Freeman McKinney, the park's namesake. In Spanish Texas, McKinney Falls State Park was traversed as part of the El Camino Real de Los Tejas. In 1716 the expedition of Domingo Ram√≥n followed the left bank of Onion Creek along the western edge of the park to its junction with Williamson Creek. Indentations in the rock resulted from extensive use of the area. The land that the park occupies was originally part of an eleven league (about ) grant that Mexican land speculator Santiago Del Valle purchased from the government of Mexico. Samuel May Williams acquired ten leagues (about ) of the grant from del Valle and sold the land to Michel Branamour Menard who in turn sold nine leagues (about ) to Thomas F. McKinney in 1839.Henson, Margaret Swett. McKinney Falls. The Texas State Historical Association, 1999. McKinney did not move to his land until 1850 and took two years to build a stone house and barns. He also built a water-powered flour gristmill in 1852. The mill was destroyed by a flood in 1869 and the house by a fire in the late 1940s. McKinney lived on the land ranching and raising thoroughbred horses until his death on October 5, 1873. McKinney's wife, Anna, sold small parcels of land to relatives, and in 1885 she sold most of the land to James W. Smith. In 1971, J.E. \\"Pete\\" Smith, the grandson of James Smith, donated of the ranch to the State of Texas for a park. The land was appraised at $731,300 and the state received a matching federal grant to develop the park. After archaeological digs and surveys were completed, the park was developed. The park was dedicated on April 14, 1976 by Texas Governor Dolph Briscoe and opened to the public on April 15. The Texas Legislature also approved funds for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department to construct new state offices on a bluff on the northern edge of the donated land. The offices are outside the park boundaries and only accessible by a separate road. Heavy rains that started on October 30, 2013, pushed the water of Onion Creek to its highest level since the park opened. Water flooded the Smith Visitor Center and damaged bathrooms, picnic sites and the Rockshelter Trail. The park was evacuated and temporarily closed while park staff cleaned up and repaired the damage. The visitor center and part of the Rockshelter Trail are still closed as of the summer of 2018. Features The upper falls. The park includes several designated hiking trails. The namesake features of the park are the scenic upper and lower falls along Onion Creek. =Flora= Bald Cypress, sycamores and pecan trees line the banks of Onion Creek and live oak, ashe juniper, and mesquite can be found on the drier uplands. Other trees found in the park include Wafer Ash, Red Oak, Texas Persimmon, chinaberry, Cedar Elm and Mexican Plum. In spring, the roads are lined with flowers, dominated by the Texas Bluebonnet. Cacti can also be found such as the Prickly Pear and Pencil Cactus. =Fauna= White-tailed deer are common throughout the park, as well as raccoons, armadillos, coyote, cottontail rabbits and Fox squirrels. Many bird species are found in the park such as the Northern mockingbird, Northern cardinal, Greater roadrunner, Carolina wren, Scissor-tailed flycatcher, Painted bunting, Carolina chickadee, Blue jay, Killdeer and Mourning dove. Areas in and around the creeks are inhabited by the Guadalupe spiny softshell turtle, Red-eared slider, Alligator snapping turtle and Blanchard's cricket frog. Many species of snakes such as the Texas rat snake, Texas indigo racer and Western diamondback rattlesnake are also found. =Historical Sites= The park also features the Smith Rock Shelter, a limestone overhang used for shelter by Native Americans for hundreds of years, along with the ruins of McKinney's stone house, gristmill and his horse trainer's cabin. The Smith Rock Shelter and the McKinney homestead have each been added to the National Register of Historic Places. Pollution The park was a popular spot for swimming from the day it opened. In April 1981, swimming in the park was banned when several elementary school children complained of cramps and nausea after swimming in Onion Creek. Testing indicated the fecal coliform count in the water was 2600 per 100 milliliters of water, well above the 200 count maximum deemed safe for swimming.Mangan, Andy. \\"McKinney Falls thrives despite ban on swimming\\". Austin American- Statesman. August 15, 1982. p B8. The problem was blamed on rain water runoff from the mostly urban area located upstream on Onion and Williamson Creeks. The run off dumped animal waste, oils, dirt and debris into the creeks.McCann, Bill. \\"Creek Pollution Cuts Use of McKinney Falls State Park\\". Austin American-Statesman. March 17, 1985. p B6. Another contributor was the Williamson Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant. The plant would occasionally dump effluent in various stages of treatment into Williamson Creek if there was equipment failure. By 1982, the plant was overloaded by the rapid growth of the city and regularly discharged effluent into the creek, not all of which met state standards for discharge. Twelve years later in June 1993, the park ban on swimming was finally lifted. This was due to the closure of the Williamson Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant in 1986, Austin's enactment of a comprehensive watershed ordinance and starting a citywide hazardous chemicals collection program.\\"A Good Week for Parks\\". The Austin Chronicle. June 24, 1993. Swimming is still often restricted because of high fecal coliform counts, usually after heavy rains.

Inventions He invented a flexible ring for a contraceptive diaphragm (and made $50,000 from selling the patent), sold real estate and was president of a company that manufactured antiseptics. Haas wanted to invent something better than the \\"rags\\" his wife and other women had to wear, he said, and got the idea for his tampon from a friend in California who used a sponge in the vagina to absorb menstrual flow. So he developed a plug of cotton inserted by means of two cardboard tubes; he did not want the woman to have to touch the cotton. He applied for a patent for the \\"Catamenal device\\" on November 19, 1931, and was granted U.S. Patent No. 1,926,900 on September 12, 1933. After failing to get people interested in his invention (including the Johnson & Johnson company), on October 16, 1933 he finally sold the patent and trademark to a Denver businesswoman, Gertrude Tendrich, for $32,000. She started the Tampax company and was its first president. Tendrich was an ambitious German immigrant who made the first Tampax tampons at her home using a sewing machine and Dr. Haas's compression machine. Tampons based on Dr. Haas' design were first sold in the U.S. in 1936. The London Sunday Times newspaper in 1969 named Haas one of the \\"1000 Makers of the Twentieth Century.\\" After selling the rights to the tampon, he continued with his doctor's practice and various business enterprises.

History  The Help America Vote Act instructed Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to develop voluntary voting system guidelines‚Äîa set of specifications and requirements against which voting systems can be tested to determine if the systems provide all of the basic functionality, accessibility and security capabilities required of these systems. On December 13, 2005, the Election Assistance Commission unanimously adopted the 2005 Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG), which significantly increase security requirements for voting systems and expand access, including opportunities to vote privately and independently, for individuals with disabilities. The guidelines update and augment the 2002 Voting System Standards, as required by HAVA, to address advancements in election practices and computer technologies. These guidelines are voluntary. States may decide to adopt them entirely or in part prior to the effective date. A proposed revision to these guidelines, known as the VVSG 1.1, was offered during a 120-day public comment period in the summer of 2009. There are also efforts in parallel to develop a rewrite of these guidelines, known as the VVSG 2.0 or the VVSG Next Iteration, though these efforts are still underway.  2002 Voting System Standards  Three iterations of federal voting system standards have been issued by the federal government. The first set of standards was created in 1990 by the Federal Election Commission (FEC.) In 2002, the FEC updated the standards by adopting a second iteration, known as the 2002 Voting System Standards (VSS). The VSS consists of two volumes: Volume 1 and Volume 2. The Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA) created the U.S. Election Assistance Commission and transferred the responsibility of developing voting system standards from the FEC to the EAC. HAVA also tasked the EAC with establishing the federal government‚Äôs first voting system certification program.  2005 Voluntary Voting System Guidelines  The EAC adopted the VVSG on December 13, 2005, after a thorough and transparent public comment process. The EAC conducted an initial review and then released the proposed guidelines for a 90-day public comment period. Each of the more than 6,000 comments were reviewed and considered before the document was finalized and adopted, and all comments are made available on the EAC Web site. The EAC held public hearings about the VVSG in New York City, NY; Pasadena, CA; and Denver, CO. The final version (Volume 1 and Volume 2) was adopted at an EAC public meeting on December 13, 2005. EAC-accredited test laboratoriesAccredited Test Laboratories by EAC currently test voting systems to both the 2002 voting system standards and the 2005 VVSG. Voting systems submitted for testing after December 13, 2007, will be tested only to the 2005 VVSG.  Voluntary Voting System Guidelines 1.1  The VVSG 1.1 Volume 1 and Volume 2 were delivered to the Election Assistance Commission in the summer of 2009. They are an incremental revision to the 2005 VVSG. They were unanimously approved by the Election Assistance Commission on March 31, 2015.  Voluntary Voting System Guidelines 2.0  The VVSG 2.0, also known as the VVSG Next Iteration, is an effort to completely re-write the 2005 VVSG, intended to address the next generation of voting systems. The TGDC prepared a draft of the VVSG 2.0, and the TGDC's draft was delivered to the Election Assistance Commission in August 2007, but have not yet been adopted by the Election Assistance Commission and work remains in progress to refine these guidelines. The guidelines contain new and expanded material in the areas of reliability and quality, usability and accessibility, security, and testing. The TGDC draft prohibits radio frequency (RF) wireless, address software independence and include improved requirements for the overall reliability of voter verifiable paper audit trail voting systems. The TGDC draft guidelines require software independence for all voting systems, in order to allow the correct outcome of an election to be determined even in the face of software bugs or vulnerabilities. According to the TGDC draft, software independence can be achieved through the use of independent voter verifiable records (IVVR) or through the innovation class. Additionally, the TGDC draft recommends open- ended vulnerability testing (OEVT), a testing method designed to bring greater security to voting systems in the polling place. = Structure of the TGDC's Draft of the VVSG 2.0 = The TGDC draft is divided into three main parts. It also includes an introduction and a glossary. The glossary can be found at the end of the document as \\"Appendix A\\" (Definition of Words with Special Meanings), and it indicates that the definitions provided there are special to the VVSG and may not conform to local or traditional usage. :Introduction - provides background information about voting system standards and guidelines; the purpose and scope; and an overview of new and expanded material. :Part I: Equipment Requirements ‚Äì includes general core requirements for voting systems and voting devices. It includes security and audit architecture, usability, accessibility and privacy requirements, security requirements, and general core requirements. :Part II: Documentation Requirements ‚Äì contains requirements that apply to the technical data package, voting equipment user documentation, the test plan, the test report, the public information package, and data for repositories. :Part III: Testing Requirements ‚Äì this section describes the way voting system test laboratories are to determine if voting systems, voting devices and software meet the requirements of the VVSG.

Early life Jacob Johnson was born on April 17, 1778. The circumstances and location of his birth remain in dispute among scholars. Marriage and family Jacob Johnson married Mary \\"Polly\\" McDonough (July 17, 1783 - February 13, 1856) on September 9, 1801 in Wake County, North Carolina.Wake County, North Carolina Marriage Bonds, Jacob Johnston to Polly McDonaugh, September 9, 1801, North Carolina State Archives, Raleigh, North Carolina.Andrew Johnson National Cemetery, Greenville, Greene County, Tennessee. They had three children: William Patterson Johnson (1804-1865), Elizabeth Johnson (born 1806), and Andrew Johnson (December 29, 1808 - July 31, 1875). Career Known as \\"mud- sills\\" (lower-class people), Jacob and Mary Johnson were both employed at Casso's Inn, where Mary worked as a weaver and clothes washer, and Jacob was a hostler. Jacob also was a militia Captain of Muster Division 20, a sexton for the Presbyterian Church, and a porter for the State Bank of North Carolina (chartered in 1811). Jacob Johnson is also said to have been the sole bell toller in Raleigh. Home Raleigh, North Carolina. The Johnson family home was an out-building of Casso's Inn, a popular antebellum inn northeast of the present-day North Carolina State Capitol building. Casso's Inn was owned by Peter Casso, a Revolutionary War soldier. The out-building is of two rooms, one on the main floor and one in the garret of the dutch or gambrel roof. The Johnson home is now preserved at Mordecai Historic Park in Raleigh, North Carolina. Death Jacob Johnson saved the lives of Colonel Thomas Henderson, the young editor of the Raleigh Star, and his friend Mr. Callum, when the enthusiastic group of fishermen capsized their fishing skiff on Walnut Creek near Hunter's Mill in December 1811. The third occupant of the skiff, Mr. William Peace, had no trouble getting to shore. Johnson jumped in the water and saved Henderson and Callum, to the detriment of his own health. He died several weeks later, ironically, while ringing the funeral bell at the State Capitol Building. He was buried at the Old City Cemetery in Raleigh, North Carolina. Johnson's obituary from the Raleigh Star of January 10, 1812, read: *\\"Died, in this city, on Saturday last, Jacob Johnson, who had for years occupied a humble but useful station in Society. He was a city constable, sexton, and porter of the State Bank. In his last illness he was visited by the principal inhabitants of the city, by all whom he was esteemed for his honesty, industry, and humane and friendly disposition. Among all whom he was known and esteemed none lament him more (except, perhaps, his relatives) than the publisher of this paper; for he owes his life, on a particular occasion, to the boldness and humanity of Johnson.\\" Following his death, Mary (McDonough) Johnson married Turner Daughtrey (or Daugherty) on May 6, 1812 in Wake County, North Carolina.Hans L. Trefousse, Andrew Johnson: A Biography, New York: W. W. Norton Co., 1989, p. 20 She is buried in the Andrew Johnson National Cemetery, Greenville, Greene County, Tennessee.Mary \\"Polly\\" McDonough Johnson Daugherty Dedication of grave Raleigh, North Carolina Jacob's grave remained marked only by \\"J.X.J.\\" until 1867, when the current marker was erected. The writing on the marker has been obliterated from weather and vandalism, but an early account indicates that it was inscribed as follows: *\\"In memory of Jacob Johnson. An honest man, loved and respected by all who knew him.\\" Then-president Andrew Johnson was invited by Raleigh Mayor William Dallas Haywood to attend the public erection of Jacob's monument. He agreed to attend the dedication; this marked Johnson's only trip to the south during his term as President. He departed Washington, DC on June 1, 1867, stayed at Richmond, Virginia on the 2nd, and arrived in Raleigh on the 3rd. Johnson stayed at the Yarborough House Hotel on Fayetteville Street during his stay, and delivered a lengthy speech about various topics shortly after arriving. The gravesite dedication took place on June 4. At the ceremony, the president called his father an \\"honest and faithful friend, a character I prize higher than all the worldly fortunes that could have been left me.\\" He spent the 5th and 6th in Chapel Hill, where he attended one of the commencement ceremonies for the University of North Carolina, and left for Washington on the 7th.

Its watershed is on the Lanarkshire border of Ayrshire at an altitude of above sea-level, near Loudoun Hill, Drumclog, and SW by W of Strathaven. It flows westward, dividing the old district of Cunninghame from that of Kyle, until it reaches the sea via Irvine Harbour in the form of the Firth of Clyde, and flows into Irvine Bay by the town of Irvine. It has many tributaries, some of which form parish, district and other boundaries. Etymology Irvine was first recorded in 1258 as Yrewyn, and several etymologies have been proposed. According to Groome,*McNaught, Duncan (1912). Kilmaurs Parish and Burgh. Pub. A.Gardner. Irvine is derived from the Gaelic iar-an meaning 'westward-flowing' river. A Brittonic origin is also possible. The root *arb-ƒ´no, meaning \\"wild turnip\\" has been suggested (c.f. Welsh erfin), though the earliest record and the possibly identical River Irfon in Wales do not encourage this. The Middle Welsh adjective erbyn meaning \\"hostility, fighting against\\" might also be considered here. An ancient river-name formation of very obscure origin is also quite probable. The course of the Irvine and its tributaries The River Irvine rises in two head-waters, the one in a moss at Meadow-head, on the eastern boundary of the parish of Loudoun or of Ayrshire, and the other a mile eastward in the parish of Avondale in Lanarkshire, near the battle-field of Drumclog. 19th-century stepping stones that used to be at Struthers Farm on the River Irvine in East Ayrshire, near CrookedholmePaterson, James (1871). Autobiographical Reminiscences. Pub. Maurice Ogle. Glasgow. P. 15. About 2¬æ miles (4.4 km) from the point it enters Ayrshire, Glen Water joins it from the north. Strictly speaking Glen Water is the parent stream, because it is longer and carries more water; for the Glen Water rises at Crosshill in Renfrewshire, a mile (1.6 km) north of the East Ayrshire boundary, and runs southward, joined by five rills (small streams) in its progress, to the point of confluence with the Irvine. Swollen by the Glen Water, the Irvine immediately passes the town of Darvel on the right, then 1¬æ mile (2.8 km) onward, the town of Newmilns and 2¬º miles (3.6 km) farther on, the town of Galston, on the left. The Hagg burn joins before the town, having run past the old ruined castle of Arclowden: Old Loudoun Castle or \\"The Old Place\\", near the present Loudoun castle.Robertson, William (1908). Ayrshire. Its History and Historic Families. Vol. 1. Pub. Dunlop & Dreenan. Kilamrnock. P. 155 The Burnanne joins at Galston. A mile and a quarter (2 km) below Galston it receives from the north the Polbaith burn; ¬æ of a mile (1.2 km) lower down, the Cessnock water joins it from the south; and later it passes Kilmarnock and Riccarton on opposite sides, and receives on its right bank the tributary of the Kilmarnock (or Marnock) Water. Four miles (6.4 km) or more along its bed, Carmel Water joins it on the right bank; and 2¬Ω miles (4 km) farther on, it receives the Annick Water, again on the right bank. The river now runs 1¬Ω mile (2.4 km) in a north-west direction, passing through the town of Irvine; it then suddenly bends round until it follows a southerly direction; and opposite the town of Irvine, when running southward, it suddenly expands into a basin ¬æ of a mile (1.2 km) wide. It receives the Garnock river at its north-west extremity, and communicates by a narrow mouth or strait with the Firth (previously Frith)MacIntosh, John (1894).

The course of the Irvine is recorded as having shifted in an old Eglinton Estates document, a map recording the previous course with a note that the water left the old riverbed in 1758. This altered the confluence of the River Irvine with the Annick Water.National Archives of Scotland. RHP3/37. The Irvine is tidal as far as the nature reserve at Shewalton, half-a-mile (800 m) or so upstream from the confluence with the Annick Water. The main contributing rivers and rivulets in descending order of their confluences are therefore the Glen Water, Polbaith Burn, Cessnock Water, Kilmarnock Water, Carmel Water, Annick Water, and the Garnock. =Views of the River Irvine in 2007= Image:Laighmilton6.JPGThe river Irvine and the view of the viaduct from near Laigh Milton Mill.

The Kilmarnock Water used to run slightly to the west as it passes through the Howard Park in Kilmarnock, previously 'Barbadoes Green'; the old 'fossilised' river bank is still discernible. It is said that this was done deliberately by a Lord Boyd, the local laird, so that he could claim more land. The river formed the boundary and by moving it permanently he gained more land. St. Winnan of KilwinningRobertson, William (1908). Ayrshire. Its History and Historic Families. Vol. 1. Pub. Dunlop & Dreenan. Kilmarnock. P. 33. is said to have made the River Garnock change its course and follow another \\"adverse to nature\\". The river's mistake was to fail to deliver up any fish to one of the saint's angler friends! The Garnock, Annick and Irvine did not even have the same confluence within recorded history, for Timothy Pont's (1604‚Äì08) and Herman Moll's (1745) maps show the Garnock emptying into the sea, about two miles (3 km) from the mouth of the Irvine.Paterson, James (1863‚Äì66). History of the Counties of Ayr and Wigton. V. ‚Äì III ‚Äì Cunninghame. J. Stillie. Edinburgh. P. 257. The Annick did not flow into the Garnock at this time and the Ardeer peninsula was an island. Subsequent to Pont's time, the sea came right up to the town, with vessels loading and unloading at the Seagate, which is now half-a-mile from the sea. The Earl of Eglinton changed the course of the Lugton Water where it ran through what is now Eglinton Country Park.Eglinton Country Park archives Adamson records that a link once existed between the Carmel Water and the Fenwick Water so as to provide more water for the needs of cutlers and tinkers in Kilmaurs. The king allowed the diversion of water that would flow through the 'leg of a boot'.Adamson, Archibald R. (1875). Rambles Round Kilmarnock. Kilmarnock : T. Stevenson. P. 143 =Parish boundaries= The parishes that border the river's south bank are Galston, Riccarton, and Dundonald; and on its north side are Loudoun, Kilmarnock, Kilmaurs, Dreghorn and Perceton, and Irvine. =Country houses= Loudoun Castle, Galston in the 1890s Craig House from Laigh Milton viaduct The presence of country estates effected the river and its tributaries, often through landscaping and engineering works such as weirs, embankments and minor alterations of its course. The feudal or Victorian estates of Loudoun castle (ruin), Cessnock house, Lanfine house, Holms house (ruin), Kilmarnock house (demolished), Peel house, Caprington, Fairlie house, Craig house (restored 2006), Newfield, Auchans (demolished), and Shewalton (demolished) were all connected with the River Irvine and on the banks of its tributaries are Craufurdland (Craufurdland Water) and Dean castle (Fenwick Water), the two joining to form the Kilmarnock Water; Rowallan, Tour house, Kilmaurs Place, Carmel Bank and Busbie castle (demolished) on the Carmel; Lainshaw (restored 2006), Chapelton (demolished), Annick Lodge, and Bourtreehill (demolished) on the Annick Water; Aiket, Bonshaw (demolished) and Kennox House on the Glazert, and Lambroughton on the Garrier. In the area around Stewarton the valley of the Annick Water was known as 'Strathannick'. Dunlop house and Corsehill castle (ruin) are on the Clerkland Burn and Robertland House is on the Swinzie Burn, both of which flow into the Annick Water. =Prehistoric sites= The Carlin Stone near Craigends Farm, East Ayrshire. 2007. A close up view of the Grannie Stone A large procumbent boulder known on the OS map as the 'Carlin's Stone' lies next to the Carlin Burn near Craigends Farm below Cameron's Moss in East Ayrshire. A Carl is a commoner, a husband or in a derogatory sense, a churl or male of low birth. More commonly the name Carlin was used as a derogatory term for a woman meaning an 'old hag'. It is also said to be a corruption of the Gaelic word \\"Cailleach\\", meaning a witch or the 'old Hag', the Goddess of Winter. This would therefore be the Witch‚Äôs or Hag's Stone, one of several in Scotland with this name. It has been much visited at one time, with the clear remains of a footbridge running to it across the Hareshawmuir Water. The Grannie Stane (or Granny Stane) is described as \\"one of Irvine's prehistoric puzzles\\", this boulder is either left behind from the Ice Age or is the last remaining stone of a stone circle ‚Äì others were removed, by blasting, after the Irvine weir was constructed in 1895, but popular protests saved this remaining stone. The Grannie Stane is visible when the water is low. It is unlikely to have gained its name from various similar sounding Roman and Celtic deities.Historic guide to Irvine  The river at work  Many of the weirs, dams and fords on the rivers were built on or developed at natural stone dikes, which already raised the water level at that point. {style=\\"float:left; margin:1em 1em 1em 1em; width:27em; border: 1px solid #a0a0a0; padding: 10px; background-color: #F5F5F5; text-align:left;\\" - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" Etymology - style=\\"text-align:left; font- size:x-medium;\\" Carmel, the oldest form of which is Caremuall, is thought to be derived, according to McNaught, from the Gaelic 'Car' meaning a 'fort', and 'Meall'. meaning a hill. Therefore, 'The fort on the hill'. } In Kilmarnock in 1880 the Glencairn Mill stood near Riccarton, just before the two bridges, with a long lade running up to join the river near the Glenfield Iron Works; Richardland Brewery sat on the river bank and no doubt used its waters. A slaughter house sat where the Kilmarnock Water joins the Irvine, with an engine works just upstream from it. A Foundry, a forge and an engine works sat beside the Kilmarnock Water at Townholm.McKay, Archibald (1880). The History of Kilmarnock. Pub. Kilmarnock. Map. The weir at Laigh Milton Mill on the Irvine at Gatehead. The mill in 2015 was a roofless ruin. A large number of mills existed along the length of the Annick Water, with only Cunninghamhead Mill still standing today (2006). The Corsehill Mills (corn and wool) were at Stewarton,Milligan, Susan. Old Stewarton, Dunlop and Lugton. Pub. Stenlake. . P. 21. powered by water from the Corsehill Burn, which arose from the Clerkland Burn. Lambroch Mill was located near Laigh Castleton Farm. Scroaggy or Fairliecrevoch Mill was a waulk mill for preparing cloth and existed until the 1960s, with its lade cutting across the large loop in the river near Ramstane. Downstream from Cunninghamhead was a sawmill and a corn mill existed in Perceton near the old church. Scroag or scrog is a crab apple or gnarled tree stumps in old Scots and this 'nickname' well describes the area where the mill stood. Riccarton Mill in the 1860s. At Galston the Burnanne joins the Irvine. This tributary was famous for its rich jasper pebbles; semi-precious stones, which were collected, cut and polished for use in jewellery. The gravel bed of rivers was an important source of income for millersFerguson, Robert (2005). A Miller's Tale. The Life and Times of Dalgarven Mill. . and others who owned the rights of extraction. The gravel was sold for various farm and horticultural purposes, such as infilling drainage ditches, the surfacing of field entrances and driveways, road surfaces, horticulture, etc. In 1656 a report to Oliver Cromwell describes the port of Irvine at being \\"clogged up and almost choked with sand.\\" In 1760 Irvine was the third most important port in Scotland, behind Port-Glasgow and Leith second.Paterson, James (1863‚Äì66). History of the Counties of Ayr and Wigton. V. ‚Äì III ‚Äì Cunninghame. J. Stillie. Edinburgh. P. 258. The river at play The River Irvine and its tributaries have many leisure uses, such as sailing, swimming, fishing, riparian walks, etc. Irvine harbour is now officially closed as a commercial port and now houses a number of privately owned pleasure craft. It is also now home to part of the Scottish Maritime Museum with numerous vessels on display, including the 'Spartan', one of the last surviving Clyde puffers. Fishing is a very popular pursuit and many angling clubs maintain the river and its banks, monitor fish stocks, report on pollution and carry out conservation measures. PontPont, Timothy (1604). Cuninghamia. Pub. Blaeu in 1654. in 1604 ‚Äì 08 writes that salmon are plentiful in the River Irvine. The river contains, amongst others, brown trout, sea trout, salmon, eels, minnows, and sticklebacks. Rivers have always been used for swimming and one such favourite swimming pool, called the 'Toad Hole' is found near Ramstane on the Annick Water above Cunninghamhead. Many others exist, such as the 'Auld dam' and the 'Munt' on the Corsehill (Clerkland) burn at Stewarton, running into the Annick, which had 'Andra Sweelzies' and the Ladies 'Dookin' Hole. =Tributaries of the Irvine ‚Äì 2007= Image:Annickwater1.JPGThe Annick Water looking upstream from Chapeltoun Bridge.

Holy waters and mineral springs  The Burnanne or Burnawn joins the Irvine at Galston. It is named after St Anne, said to be the mother of the Virgin Mary. The St Anne's holy well is marked on the OS and lies above Bank wood, flowing into the Burn Anne. Maria's well lies on the Byrebank burn, in the Loudoun castle policies, which runs down near Loudoun Academy to join the Irvine. A mineral spring is recorded as being near Stewarton, North Ayrshire, called the Bloak Well.Paterson, James (1863‚Äì66). History of the Counties of Ayr and Wigton. V. ‚Äì III ‚Äì Cunninghame. J. Stillie. Edinburgh. RobinsonRobinson, Mairi (2000). The Concise Scots Dictionary. Aberdeen. gives the Scot's word 'blout' as meaning the 'eruption of fluid'. A view of Bloak Well, now called Salt Well in 2006 Bloak Well was first discovered in 1800,Smith, John (1895). Prehistoric Man in Ayrshire. Pub.

Mr. Cunningham of Lainshaw built a handsome house over the well in 1833 and appointed a keeper to take care of it as the mineral water was of some value. The mineral well waters empty into the Glazert, which joins the Annick Water at Watermeetings near Cunninghamhead. A view of the Monk's or Mack's Well in Kilmaurs. The Chapel Burn rises near the Anderson Plantation in the fields below Lainshaw Mains and it is marked as a chalybeate or mineral spring on the 1911 6\\" OS map. Bore holes nearby suggest that the water was put to a more formal use at one time, supplying cattle troughs or possibly even for a stand pipe as mineral water was popular for its supposed curative properties. According to the opinion of the day, it could cure ‚Äòthe colic, the melancholy, and the vapours; it made the lean fat, the fat lean; it killed flat worms in the belly, loosened the clammy humours of the body, and dried the over-moist brain. The main spring here has been covered over and the water piped out to the burn, which runs down to join the Annick Water at Chapeltoun Bridge. In the woodland policies of Chapeltoun House is the Monk's Well (OS 1974), fountain or spring as indicated on the OS maps going back as far as 1858. Its present appearance is probably as a Victorian or Edwardian 'whimsy' or 'folly' with a large, thick sandstone 'tombstone appearance' with a slightly damaged cross carved in relief upon it and a spout through which the spring water once passed into a cast iron 'bowl'. It seems unlikely from the workmanship that this stone and cross have anything to do with the old chapel, but one possibility is that it came from over the entrance door to Laigh Chapelton as the custom was for a Templar property to have the 'cross' symbol of the order displayed in such a fashion[2]. On the other hand, it could have been made for the Chapelton (old) House to associate the building with the Christian history of the site. The stone is unusually thick and has been clearly reworked to pass a spout through it. The OS record that in the 1970s a Mr. H. Gollan of Chapeltown stated that the 'Monk's Well', was believed to have been associated with the chapel. In July 1956 the OS state that the 'Monk's Well' is a spring emerging through a stone pipe, situated in a stone-faced cutting in the hill slope, the spring water running into the Annick Water.

It dried up until the lord changed his mind, but has run continuously ever since. A few deaths have occurred here by drowning or by physical trauma*McNaught, Duncan (1912). Kilmaurs Parish and Burgh.

The Tour streamlet joins the Carmel nearby and before the confluence can be found an old well, arched over, known as the Lady's Well, with never-failing, excellent and refeshingly cool water. A small wooden bridge used to run across to the Lady's Well from the church glebe side. A view from Chapelhouse Bridge (Lady's Steps) of the Chapel Crags with St.Mary's House in the distance.

It bears the date 839 AD (see photograph). A monastic settlement and chapel of Saint Mary at the Thurgartstone near Dunlop's Chapel Crags, is a Christian centre established to eradicate the pagan significance of the site. Monastic cells, a chapel and a graveyard are all now lost to view, originally constructed by the monks of Kilwinning Abbey; only the name 'St. Marys' given to the nearby 'modern' dwellings, built on the site of the chapel record past significance. The Holy Well still exists, the nearby houses pumping water up from its source. The water from the well used to run under the road and emerge in a trough surrounded by a metal fence and then on into the Black Water, which joins the Glazert nearby. Only a concrete manhole indicates this trough now (2006). In 1856 the water for baptism in Dunlop Kirk was still drawn from this Holy Well.Name Book (1856). Ordnance Survey.

A fair number are present, often on the higher reaches of the rivers. Some are named, such as Lizzie's Linn at Caven Mill, Montgreenan, on the Lugton Water. The Cessnock Water has a number on its course through the woods at the Carnell estate near Fiveways outside Kilmarnock. A series of low waterfalls occur at Cunnighamhead on the Annick Water, these being, like many others, dykes that are more resistant to erosion than the surrounding rocks. Other notable waterfalls are on the Polbaith burn, Fenwick Water (near Rigghill), Glen water (Darvel) and Burn Anne. Weirs were often built to divert and provide a head of water for the many mills. A more unusual use of a weir was that at Lainshaw House where two weirs, together with a realignment of the Annick Water, provided a large area of water for waterfowl, shooting and ornament. Death on the river Over the centuries the River Irvine and its tributaries have been associated with many violent deaths and accidental drownings, some famous enough to have been recorded and remembered in the folklore of the county. =Witches= It is recorded that a deep pool in the River Irvine at Irvine was called the 'Witches Plumb' and that it may have been used to duck supposed witches to see if the Devil would save them. This pool lay near the site of the old Gallows Knowe where the old Irvine Royal Academy building was constructed.Strawhorn, John (1985). The History of Irvine. Royal Burgh and Town. Edinburgh : John Donald. Page 44. =Drownings= In the 19th century a Mr. Roxborough, weaver of Galston, after a drinking bout lasting several days, called for his suit one night, saying that the gentleman in black wanted him. Leaving the house with the imaginary man he was later found drowned at the large whinstone rock near the southern termination of the Shawhill Woods at Hurlford by some of Mr John Carse's sons.

Maid Morville's mound was located to the left of the bridge over the Irvine at Holmford near Dreghorn. It commemorated the tragic drowning of a female member of this family whilst crossing the Irvine at the old ford. The De Morvilles were the overlords of the Baillie of Cunninghame in feudal times. The mound was destroyed by the earthworks of the new expressway. A 'Maid Morville' street still exists in Dreghorn to commemorate the event. A tombstone in Dreghorn parish churchyard records the tragedy of the drowning in the Annick Water at Perceton of Aurthur Watson, aged two years and eight months on the twelfth of July 1867. His mother was Agnes McAntosh. In 1843 two young women crossing the pedestrian 'Auld brig (1824)' across the Carmel in Kilmaurs on a stormy night December night carrying a heavy load between them; they missed the way and the one in front was swept away and drowned. On 18 August 2007 a Stewarton boy fell into the Annick Water when it was in flood. The scene of the tragedy was near Lainshaw House. Royal Navy 'Search and Rescue' helicopter from HMS Gannet searched the river for several hours, unsuccessfully. The body was found in the river a few days later near the sewerage works. =Death through violence= Craignaught Hill lies in the north-east area of the Parish of Dunlop, with the Clerkland Burn running beneath and on through the grounds of Dunlop House to join the Annick Water at Stewarton. On the slopes of Craignaught Hill was fought a singularly unusual battle between the Boyds of Kilmarnock and the Stewarts of Darnley. Sir Alan Stewart had been treacherously slain by Sir Thomas Boyd, and his son, Alexander Stewart, was determined to take revenge. Sir Thomas was surprised on the night of 9 July 1439, whilst riding past Craignaught on his way north and although outnumbered, he and his followers fought on, even taking agreed rest periods indicated by the sounding of a horn. Eventually and inevitably Sir Thomas was killed, stabbed in the back by a Stewart, and a large number of his followers were also killed. The result of this encounter led to killings and counter killings that involved a great part of the West of Scotland. Boyd's wife had dreamed all that came to pass, and died of grief within days of her husband death.Robertson, William (1908). Ayrshire. Its History and Historic Families. Vols. 2. Pub.

Sir William Wallace was fishing on the Irvine when a troop of English soldiers dismounted and demanded that he give up his catch. He offered to share, but this was refused and he was grossly insulted by the soldiers for his temerity. He had no weapons, however he used his fishing rod to disarm one soldier and then killed him with his own sword. He similarly dispatched two others and the remaining soldiers then fled. He went to his uncle's castle, the nearby Riccarton Castle, and in the following months an uprising slowly gained impetus through the example of one unarmed Scotsman killing three armed soldiers. A thorn tree called the \\"Bickering Bush\\" stood nearby and a public house by that name existed in Kilmarnock until it was demolished prior to the construction of the A71 Irvine flyover across the A77 Ayr Road on the site.

Chambers. . } In April 1586, Hugh, 4th. Earl of Eglinton was travelling to Stirling to join the royal court having been commanded to attend by the King. He was accompanied only by a few domestic servants and being in no great hurry he stopped at Lainshaw Castle to dine with his close relative, a Montgomerie who was Lord of Lainshaw and whose Lady was a Margaret Cunninghame of Aiket Castle, with sisters married to John Cunninghame of Corsehill and David Cunninghame of Robertland.Dobie, James D.

Thirty Cunninghames attacked the Earl at the Annick ford and cut his servants to pieces with swords and other weapons, the Earl himself being finally dispatched with a single shot from the pistol of John Cuninghame of Clonbeith Castle. His horse carried his dead body along the side of the river, still known in Stewarton as the 'Weeping', 'Mourning' or 'Widows' path. A wave of bloody revenge swept over Cunninghame and elsewhere, with Cunninghame friends, relatives and adherents killed without restraint.Robertson, William (1889). \\"Historical Tales of Ayrshire\\".

They drove their carts along the dry bed of the Carmel to catch the water, which poured from an exit high up on the wall. One of these farmers horses bolted, bringing the head of a female rider into violent contact with the arch of the 'Auld Brig', killing the unfortunate woman outright.  Crossing the river =Stilts= It is recorded that stilts were sometimes used to cross the river, for example Thomas Raeburn of Holmhead near Hurlford worked as a gardener at Shawhill House and regularly crossed the River Irvine using stilts. At nearby Barleith, Mayday festivities sometimes included stilt races across and back, resulting in much amusement as many competitors fell into the water.Wilson, M. (1875). The Ayrshire Hermit : Tammie Raeburn. Hurlford Sixty Years Ago. Kilmarnock : Alfred chas. Jonas. P. 63 =Ferries and carrying= Irvine circa 1870. The Old brig, kirk, manse, etc.Wilson, Professor.(1870) The Works of Robert Burns, Pub. Blackie & son. London. Rivers form physical boundaries and are only crossed with either trouble or expense. At the port of Irvine itself ferry boats took passengers across to Ardeer, further upstream fords and /or stepping stones were present in many places. These were often treacherous and could turn from tranquil to lethal in a matter of minutes, often with no warning as the rainfall could well have fallen far upstream or at the moors that form the watershed. At one time people were carried across rivers, usually at fords, but not necessarily. A fee would normally be charged or it might be part of the 'job description' of a servant. One Ayrshire story tells of a rich farmer who employed a servant girl to carry him across the river on his way to church each Sunday. As time went by he became very fond of the servant and eventually they married. She willingly carried him across on the way to their wedding, but she refused on the way back and never carried him again. The Kilmarnock Standard newspaper recorded in 2011 that a leisure boat service had been set up in the 1930s, running from a short concrete jetty, however it was not a success and did not continue for long. =Stepping stones= Many sets of stepping stones are recorded on OS maps, such as at Shawhill Farm near Hurlford, crossing over to Templetonburn and Skerrinngton Mains nearby. Stepping stones are marked on the 1897 OS map as being located just downstream from the present Chapeltoun bridge over the Annick Water and further upstream near Townhead of Lambroughton. The then owner of Chapeltoun Mains had the Chapeltoun stepping stone sremoved in the 20th century. Stepping stones are shown near Waterside Farm on the Irvine at Galston. Stepping stones and a ford existed at Kaimshill House near Crookedholme in the 1870s; called 'Struthers Steps' they crossed the river Irvine below Struther's Farm, home to James Paterson.Paterson, James (1871). Autobiographical Reminiscences. Pub. Maurice Ogle. Glasgow. P. 15. The Kilmarnock Glenfield Ramblers in 1931 remark on the stepping stones at Struthers having long since disappeared and that stepping stones at Haining on the Cessnock Water still survived.Dunlop, William (1931), Riccarton Moss and the Haining, 02/05/1931.

P. 144. {style=\\"float:left; margin:1em 1em 1em 1em; width:27em; border: 1px solid #a0a0a0; padding: 10px; background-color: #F5F5F5; text-align:left;\\" - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" Etymology - style=\\"text-align:left; font-size:x-medium;\\" The name Annick, previously Annock, Annoch (1791) or Annack Water, possibly derives from the Gaelic abhuin, meaning water and oc or aig meaning little or small. } An interesting possible origin of the name of the Puddle ford at Irvine is 'holy steps' ('pas de Dieu'), referring to the stepping stones the Carmelite Priory monks made their way across on their way to Church. Some of the stepping stones may have come from the stone circle, later removed, of which the Grannie stone is the last survivor. Use of the Puddleford by horses was prohibited in 1836 to safeguard access to the Puddly Well, one of the public wells all of which were repaired at about that time. =Fords= The Dean Ford over the Kilmarnock Water in Kilmarnock. 2007. The partial 'suspension' bridge over the Dean Ford at the Kilmarnock Water in Kilmarnock. 2007. The toll road authorities found fords something of a nuisance as passage was free unlike the bridge where a toll was levied. To prevent this they often obtained authority to deepen the fords in the river to force the use of bridges on the toll roads; very few fords therefore remain in Ayrshire. Even the Dean Ford has ceased to exist on the Kilmarnock Water after resolution of difficulties to do with the legal transfer of the property to the council by Lord Howard de Walden and the legal definition of the boundaries of the lands gifted. Further up the Fenwick Water the Bringan Ford still survives. Many of the fords eventually developed wooden footbridges alongside, such as at the Bringan Ford and as at Knockentiber in 1860 on the old Kilmarnock Road ford. The fine 'suspension bridge' footbridge at the Dean Ford was famous for collapsing with the weight of sightseers on its opening day. It was replaced with a stronger structure but has been removed due to the ford being bridged over circa 2016. The Bringan Ford on the Fenwick Water. A 'Romford', 'Rameford', 'Room' or 'Rome Ford' was situated where the modern road bridge crosses the Irvine at Gatehead. In Scots 'Rommle' is to rumble or stir violently, a more likely explanation than some memory of the Roman occupation of Scotland. Another suggestion is that 'Room' or 'Rome' meant a small farm. AdamsonAdamson, Archibald R. (1875). Rambles Round Kilmarnock. Pub. Kilmarnock. P. 93. states that this bridge was built in around 1870, replacing an older bridge. The Hurling Ford existed at Shewalton where it crossed the river to the Warrix Holm (see video). =Pedestrian and road bridges= Bridges were built where they could be afforded or where they were most needed. Many of the older bridges were built by local lairds, such as Chapeltoun Bridge over the Annick Water, which was built in the 1850s to replace a ford downstream at Bankend, opposite West Lambroughton. The Law Bridge over the Glen Water near Darvel. 2007. The Old Brig over the Carmel Water in the park below Kilmaurs Place. Archibald AdamsonAdamson, Archibald R. (1875). Rambles Round Kilmarnock. Pub. Kilmarnock. Pps. 47 ‚Äì 48. on his Rambles Round Kilmarnock in 1875 records that the Irvine is the Parish boundary between Kilmarnock and Riccarton and that the ancient bridge running into Riccarton bears the date 1726. AitonAiton, William (1811). General View of the Agriculture of Ayr. Pub. Glasgow. states that the stones used to build this bridge were conveyed in the first wheeled carts used in Ayrshire, sledges having been employed on the poor quality roads that existed prior to this time. The new brisge was built here about 1845. The pedestrian 'Auld Brig' across the Carmel water in Kilmaurs was built to replace stepping stones in 1824. It has been the scene of two deaths. Craufurdland Bridge with the balustrade from Cessnock Castle. Both BeattieBeattie, Robert (1990). Kilmaurs Past and Present. Kilmaurs Historical Society. and the Kilmarnock Glenfield Ramblers refer to Murdock's or Murdoch's iron bridge over the Carmel Water near Kilmaurs-Glencairn church as being the oldest iron bridge in Scotland. It was erected following a 1d subscription from each of the house-houlders of Ayrshire. The council demolished it in around the year 2000 and replaced it with a wooden bridge. The bridge over the Craufurdland Water at Craufurdland was built by Mr. Craufurdland, using the balusters from the original part of the battlements of Cessnock Castle, which had originally been given to Captain Whyte of The Cottage.Landsborough, Rev. David (1879), Contributions to Local History. Pub. Dunlop & Drennan. P. 157. A bridge at Haining in 1931 went over the Cessnock. It was made from two wires stretched, one above the other, across the water. The one-man-at-a-time bridge was traversed by the passager holding the top wire and placing their feet on the lower wire. =Railway bridges= Railways appeared very early in this part of Scotland and one of the first built was the stone viaduct over the Irvine at Laigh Milton, part of the Kilmarnock and Troon Railway. It has four arches, and although not used since 1846, it was restored in 1996. The railway carried steam locomotives 9 years before the Stockton and Darlington Railway and is believed to be the first passenger steam railway in the world. The viaduct itself, built in 1811, is the oldest surviving railway viaduct in Scotland. and one of the oldest in the world: Many of the railways that crossed the river were mineral lines, which often had an intensive but short life, such as the 1923 OS mineral lines that ran to collieries near Earlston, Nether Craig and Cockhill farm (Fairlie (Pit No.3)). The 1860 OS names the 'Fairlie Branch' and indicates its operation by the Glasgow and South Western Railway company. The bridges built for these lines are still clearly visible.  Taming the river  Flood prevention schemes have canalised the Kilmarnock (previously the Marnock) Water where it runs down through Kilmarnock towards the Irvine, with significantly raised banks and automatically closing gates. The Irvine has likewise been tamed with a large flood prevention scheme at east Holmes Wetlands near Galston. Here the river is directed into its old floodplains when the water rises above a certain height, thereby protecting Kilamarnock. A scheme on the River Cessnock is underway (2007). Many sections of the other rivers have been canalised and / or have bunds on either bank to prevent the watercourses flooding into their flood plains.  The river system and its wildlife  A map of part of the course of the Annick Water in 1897, showing Cunninghamhead Mill and bridge. =Meadow plants= Many of the water meadows are rich in pignut (Conopodium majus), a relative of parsley, which formed a breaktime snack for children in former times. The plant is dug up to harvest a small potato-like structure that, eaten raw, has a slightly nutty taste. It is available commercially for salads, etc. Hemlock water dropwort grows well in the wetter areas and is best left alone as the name hemlock suggests. The large leaves of the butterbur (Petasites hybridus) are found in several areas; its name harkens back to the days before clingfilm or cheap paper when the leaves were used to wrap butter destined for the market. Water ragwort (or Saracen's ragwort) (a species of Senecio) is an introduced plant that grows along the Garnock in tall stands. Although it is common on the Garnock and at present quite rare elsewhere. Himalayan balsam or policemen's helmets is another introduction, but a common one. Giant hogweed is beginning to make its presence felt. It is another plant that should never be handled, as the sap can cause severe blistering and scarring of the skin. The Stewarton Flower or pink purslane (Claytonia sibirica) is common in wetter areas. It has white or pink flowers at this site, but closer to Stewarton it is almost always white. It seems that it was first introduced as a white variety in the Stewarton area in Victorian times and the common pink variety, introduced later, spread to other areas. Dalgarven, it seems, is on the edge of the white flower zone of dominance. Coppicing of the riverside alder trees is still carried out, often unintentionally by the anglers. Alders grow well in wet soils and are specially adapted for the low nutrient conditions through having large root nodules containing nitrogen-fixing bacteria that enrich the soil in the same way as clover plants and other legumes. The trees in the vicinity of the rivers were not planted by farmers for 'visual effect', they were crops and the wood was used for building and fencing; The millers needed beech or hornbeam wood for mill machinery, in particular the cogs on the drive wheels from the waterwheel. It is not generally appreciated how much the Ayrshire landscape has changed its character over the last few hundred years, for even in the 1760‚Äì70 Statistical Account it is stated that \\"there was no such thing to be seen as trees or hedges in the parish; all was naked and open.\\" =Birds, fish and other animals= The river and its banks, support, amongst others, Kingfishers, tawny and barn owls, herons, moorhean, coot, mallard, ravens, rooks, treecreepers, buzzards, peewits or lapwings, roe deer, mink, moles, shrews, grey squirrels, hares, hedgehogs, foxes, badgers, pipistrelle bats and otters. Migrating Canada and Graylag Geese frequent the nearby fields on their way up from the Solway Firth / Caerlaverock area or coming down from Spitzbergen in the winter. {style=\\"float:right; margin:1em 1em 1em 1em; width:27em; border: 1px solid #a0a0a0; padding: 10px; background-color: #F5F5F5; text-align:left;\\" - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" Etymology - style=\\"text-align:left; font-size:x-medium;\\" The name 'Glazert' may come from the Celtic, glas in Gaelic meaning grey or green and dur meaning water. } The river's water quality is generally quite good nowadays, proven by the presence of freshwater limpets and shrimps, together with leeches, caddis fly larvae and water snail species. Pont in 1604 ‚Äì 08 writes that salmon are plentiful in the River Irvine. The river system contains, amongst others, brown trout, sea trout, salmon, eels, minnows, lampreys, and sticklebacks. The brown colour of the Irvine at places like Darvel and Newmilns is not a result of pollution, but simply organic material washed out of the peat banks at the watershed. Freshwater mussels, a species persecuted for its pearls, are found in places on the Glazert and the Garnock.  Micro history  Pont in 1604‚Äì08 records that so thickly was the district about Stewarton and along the banks of the Irvine populated for a space of three or four miles \\"that well travelled men in divers parts of Europe (affirm) that they have seen walled cities not so well or near planted with houses so near each other as they are here, wherethrough it is so populous that, at the ringing of a bell in the night for a few hours, there have seen convene 3000 able men, well-horsed and armed.\\"Robertson, William (1908). Ayrshire. Its History and Historic Families. Vol.1. Pub. Dunlop & Dreenan. Kilmarnock. P. 303 Shewalton Sand Pits is a Scottish Wildlife Trust nature reserve on the River Irvine near Irvine. Immense labour has been expended over the years in retaining building walls on either side of many of the rivers and burns. At Chapeltoun on the Annick Water even the Chapel Burn bed is 'cobbled'. This drystone walling was important in reducing the erosion of the river banks. The Annick Water near Cunninghamhead mill. A waterfall near Cunninghamhead bridge on the Annick Water. The Brackenburn near Kilmaurs has been misnamed as the Garrier by the Ordnance Survey since the 1860s. When burns or rivers join it is usually the largest that decides the name of the river downstream, unless the name changes completely, such as the Kilmarnock Water forming from the Fenwick and Craufurdland Waters. Occasionally a water course is reduced in volume due to changes upstream, a case in point being the Garrier, which used to drain Buiston Loch near Kilmaurs. This was drained as part of agricultural improvements and now the Garrier is only seasonal, even though it keeps the name Garrier, even when joined by the Brackenburn and the Lochrig burns that flow all year. It was not easy being a miller, for instance some people held the belief that it was wrong to use water artificially; that to turn water from its course was to act against God's plan. Willsher, Betty and Hunter, Doreen (1978). Stones, A Guide to Some Remarkable 18th. Century Gravestones. . Ancient mills, it was believed, had been piously placed by their forefathers where they could be worked according to God's order, without artificially embanking the water or turning it from its natural course, which would be sinful.Gauldie, Enid (1981). The Scottish Miller 1700‚Äì1900. Pub. John Donald. . New field drainage work on farms in the 18th and 19th centuries had dramatic effects on water courses, most often recorded through complaints by millers that they could no longer get enough water to turn their mills waterwheels. The weir at Dalgarven on the River Garnock is made of boulders which are carefully placed and locked together to create a natural millpond to supply a good head of water to the wheel through the lade. The weir is built on a natural dyke across the Garnock at this point, its existence being carefully exploited by the monks of Kilwinning Abbey who chose the site for Dalgarven Mill. The Automatic tide signalling apparatus at Irvine harbour is probably unique, having been invented and patented by Martin Boyd, the Irvine harbour master, in 1905 and opened in 1906.McEwan, Mae (1985). The Harbour- Fullarton folk reminisce. Pub. Fullarton Historical Society. Inside front cover. In February 2009 the Lochrig or Lochridge Burn was severely polluted with diesel oil spilled from a train derailed at the railway bridge near Peacockbank farm, Stewarton. Mitigation measures were put in place, however pollution eventually reached the River Irvine.METRO. 28 January 2009. p. 5.

Spanning thirty years and four albums, the series comprises five parts, all of which carry unifying musical motifs. Parts I and II were released as the introductory and final tracks on King Crimson's 1973 album of the same name, part III was featured on their 1984 album Three of a Perfect Pair, part IV (itself divided into three identically titled parts) appeared on 2000's The Construkction of Light, and the final part, \\"Level Five\\", was included on the 2003 album The Power to Believe. Despite breaking the naming convention, Robert Fripp, King Crimson founder and only constant contributor to the suite, insists that \\"Level Five\\" is part of the pentalogy. In 2011, PopMatters ranked the first part of \\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\\" as the eighth best progressive rock song ever. Parts I and II \\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part One\\", the longest entry in the pentalogy, was first released as the introductory track to the album of the same name. The song is guided by the shifting guitar of Robert Fripp, but it is in the tense violin of David Cross and the chaotic percussion of Jamie Muir that part I is defined. The track goes through numerous varied acts and passages, with somber moments and a calm violin solo falling alongside periods of heightened aggression where Fripp's guitar borders on heavy metal and Muir's clangs reach cacophony. Bird calls, metallic clangs, horns, breaking crockery and tin ripping are all featured in Muir's repertoire, and, along with his percussive contributions, he coined the title \\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\\". In a 1991 interview, Muir said it was a \\"very admirable creative decision\\" for Fripp to work with him. Much of the track originated from full-band improvisations that began in 1971, with Cross calling it \\"grown\\" instead of written. Drummer Bill Bruford said the songs were \\"hell\\" to make given the deliberate lack of in-studio structure. An early version of part I recorded by the 1971 lineup appeared as a bonus track on the 40th anniversary edition of Islands under the name \\"A Peacemaking Stint Unrolls\\". While the first part is a many-sectioned, dynamic song that has been described as having a \\"kitchen-sink sensibility\\", \\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part Two\\" is much more straightforward and riff-focused, with the sole writing credit going to Fripp. PopMatters called the track a \\"roller-coaster of wrath and control\\". The main riff of part II, which emerged in 1972 during a live performance at Richmond, Kentucky, is heavy and driving, drawing its host album to a dramatic climax. While the guitar in part II may be the most immediately obvious aspect, John Goldsby of Bass Player called the bass in the song something that \\"bass players will still be talking about four decades later\\". Fripp considered the first two parts of \\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\\" as the refinement of his role as composer in King Crimson. According to Fripp, part I was conceived as the beginning of a King Crimson performance, and part II as the end. \\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part One\\" was performed from 1972 to 1974, predominantly in a shortened seven-minute version that left out most of the violin solo and protracted ending passage. Part I was not performed again until 2014, when it was reintroduced as a setlist staple; it remained there through 2019. The new arrangement featured all of the violin segments played on guitar, save for the solo, which was performed by Mel Collins on flute. Part II, alternatively, persisted in King Crimson's sets throughout most of their career. Both the first and second parts of \\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\\" have been met with critical acclaim. In 2011, Sean Murphy of PopMatters ranked the \\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part One\\" as the eighth best progressive rock song ever. He revised his placement in 2017, putting part I as number fifteen and \\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part Two\\" as eighty-five. Marc Malitz of Louder Sound judged the first part as the forty-second best progressive song ever. =Personnel= All credits adapted from Larks' Tongues in Aspic liner notes. * Robert Fripp ‚Äì guitars, Mellotron * David Cross ‚Äì violin, viola * John Wetton ‚Äì bass * Bill Bruford ‚Äì drums, woodblock * Jamie Muir ‚Äì percussion, drums, autoharp Part III \\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic Part III\\" was released as the closing track on 1984's Three of a Perfect Pair. This part marks a drastic shift in style from the previous two entries, thanks to being created a decade later with two new people, Adrian Belew and Tony Levin, involved. Part III opens with the same melodic motif seen in parts I and II, but the rhythms and tones are significantly different, with Bruford playing a mix of acoustic and electronic drums. Greg Prato of AllMusic counted \\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic Part III\\" as one of his favourite songs from Three of a Perfect Pair. =Personnel= All credits adapted from Three of a Perfect Pair liner notes. * Robert Fripp ‚Äì guitars * Adrian Belew ‚Äì guitars * Tony Levin ‚Äì bass * Bill Bruford ‚Äì drums Part IV and \\"Coda: I Have a Dream\\" Seeds of the fourth part of the suite were gestating as early as 1995 and appeared as early as 1997 during the band's rehearsals at Nashville. It was not until 2000 that \\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic ‚Äì Part IV\\" was released, appearing on the album The Construkction of Light. Like part II, part IV is heavily guitar-driven, but it introduces new rhythmic and melodic motifs to the series, which would be explored further in part V. \\"Coda: I Have a Dream\\" shares some of the series' motifs, but also features lyrics and vocals from Adrian Belew. Though \\"Coda\\" was performed live with vocals in 2000, it was later performed live as an instrumental in 2001 and 2003. On The Construkction of Light, \\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic - Part IV\\" is divided into three identically titled tracks that segue into \\"Coda: I Have a Dream\\", which is followed by a minute of silence. However, part IV and \\"Coda\\" are indexed together in live releases of the 2000-2003 period, as well as the \\"Expanded Edition\\" of The Construkction of Light, which also removes the silence after \\"Coda\\". =Personnel= All credits adapted from The Construkction of Light liner notes. * Robert Fripp ‚Äì guitars, keyboards * Adrian Belew ‚Äì guitars, vocals * Trey Gunn ‚Äì Warr guitar * Pat Mastelotto ‚Äì drums \\"Level Five\\" Originally, the fifth part of \\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\\" was the song \\"FraKctured\\" off of The Construkction of Light, but, seeing how it bore closer resemblance to \\"Fracture\\" from 1974's Starless and Bible Black, the band agreed to change the name late in the song's development. The fifth part was ultimately released on 2003's The Power to Believe with the title \\"Level Five\\". Though nothing in the album's packaging confirmed that the song was part of \\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\\", it shared elements of the series' rhythmic structure and form. While the relationship to the suite was hinted with an early 2001 tour jam combining a riff from part 1 of the suite with part of this piece, official confirmation only first appeared in the Elements 2017 box set, where it was included in sequence with the rest of the suite and called \\"truly LTIA Pt V in all but name.\\" The following year, Fripp confirmed that \\"Level Five\\" was indeed the fifth entry in the suite, but was renamed to \\"unseat\\" the expectations associated with the \\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\\" title. It has since appeared on setlists and DGM Live downloads as \\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic Part V\\". \\"Level Five\\" is a heavy guitar-driven track with glitchy and electronic drums that provide a rare, almost industrial groove. Several critics noted the sonic aggression of the song, and some compared the guitar interplay between Fripp and Belew as similar to the music on 1981's Discipline. AllMusic's Lindsay Planer called \\"Level Five\\" so intense \\"that it could easily be mistaken for the likes of Tool, Ministry, Nine Inch Nails, or KMFDM\\". =Personnel= All credits adapted from The Power to Believe liner notes. * Robert Fripp ‚Äì guitars, keyboards * Adrian Belew ‚Äì guitars * Trey Gunn ‚Äì Warr guitar * Pat Mastelotto ‚Äì drums References Category:King Crimson songs Category:1973 songs Category:Experimental rock songs Category:Pentalogies Category:Rock instrumentals Category:Songs written by Adrian Belew Category:Songs written by Robert Fripp Category:Songs written by Trey Gunn Category:Songs written by Tony Levin Category:Songs written by Pat Mastelotto Category:Songs written by John Wetton ","title":"Larks' Tongues in Aspic (instrumental)"},{"id":"10396151","text":"God's Politics: Why the Right Gets It Wrong and the Left Doesn't Get It is a 2005 book by author Jim Wallis.

The Seventh-day Adventist church teaches that these messages are given to prepare the world for the second coming of Jesus Christ, and sees them as a central part of its own mission. Messages Summary paraphrases of the 3 Angels' messages: *Angel One (RV 14:6): Has the everlasting gospel to preach to all who are on the earth, \\"for the hour of his judgment has come.\\" *Angel Two (RV 14:8): Babylon the great is fallen because she caused all nations to drink of the wrath of her fornication. *Angel Three (RV 14:9): If anyone worships the beast, & receives its mark, they shall drink of the cup of the wrath of God. The Three Angels' messages of Revelation 14 are highly significant to the Seventh-day Adventist Church. In the SDA Church's official mission statement, the Three Angels' Messages are prominent: The mission of the Seventh-day Adventist Church is to proclaim to all peoples the everlasting gospel in the context of the Three Angels' messages of Revelation 14:6‚Äì12.  Adventist interpretations  The Seventh-day Adventist Church has traditionally believed that it is the remnant church of Bible prophecy, and that its mission is to proclaim the three angels' messages which it uses in its signs and logos. = Official views = : \\"The universal church is composed of all who truly believe in Christ, but in the last days, a time of widespread apostasy, a remnant has been called out to keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. This remnant announces the arrival of the judgment hour, proclaims salvation through Christ, and heralds the approach of His second advent. This proclamation is symbolized by the three angels of Revelation 14; it coincides with the work of judgment in heaven and results in a work of repentance and reform on earth. Every believer is called to have a personal part in this worldwide witness.\\" :Fundamental Beliefs of the Seventh- day Adventist Church :\\"In accordance with God's uniform dealing with mankind, warning them of coming events that will vitally affect their destiny, He has sent forth a proclamation of the approaching return of Christ. This preparatory message is symbolized by the three angels‚Äô messages of Revelation 14, and meets its fulfillment in the great Second Advent Movement today. This has brought forth the remnant, or Seventh-day Adventist Church, keeping the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.\\" :Seventh-day Adventist Church Manual The Mission Statement of the church declares: :\\"The mission of the Seventh-day Adventist Church is to proclaim to all peoples the everlasting gospel of God's love in the context of the three angels' messages of Revelation 14:6‚Äì12, and as revealed in the life, death, resurrection, and high priestly ministry of Jesus Christ, leading them to accept Jesus as personal Saviour and Lord and to unite with His remnant church; and to nurture believers as disciples in preparation for His soon return.\\"\\"Mission Statement of the Seventh-day Adventist Church\\". Official statement approved by the General Conference Executive Committee at the Spring Meeting in Silver Spring, Maryland, April 1993; and amended on October 10, 2004 The image of three angels circling a globe is the church's former symbol. The current logo of the Seventh-day Adventist church has three flames encircling the globe, representing the Holy Spirit; the threefold flame is also a symbol of the three angels. =Millerite interpretations= According to the understanding of the Adventist pioneers, the first angel's message occurred during the two decades prior to the spring of 1844. The message of the imminent second coming of Jesus preached by the Millerite movement then fulfilled the prophecy of the first angel's message. The second angel's message was then preached during the (northern-hemisphere) summer of 1844, which was preceded by a significant number of Millerites leaving the movement, and resulted in large numbers of Christians leaving their churches (\\"Babylon\\") and joining the Advent movement. The third angel's message is based on the idea that the \\"Seal of God\\" (Revelation 7:2) is the Sabbath commandment of the decalogue. Therefore, the \\"mark of the beast\\" is the opposite, or the keeping of Sunday as the Sabbath. Hence the close of the message, \\"here are they that keep the commandments of God.\\" It is a point of emphasis among Adventists that the mark of the beast has not yet been given out. (The Millerites generally interpreted \\"Babylon\\" in the Book of Revelation as the papacy, up through summer 1843. This position aligned with that of most Protestants. Millerite preacher Charles Fitch expanded the idea of \\"Babylon\\" to include all Catholics and Protestants who rejected the Adventist teaching. His message was \\"Come out of her, my people\\" - based on Revelation 18:2,4 (see also 14:8). This had followed a shift in 1843 when the Millerites received more ridicule, and were increasingly disfellowshipped by their churches. The Millerites came to see themselves as a separate group, increasingly so as many of them experienced disfellowshipping. Most of the eastern leaders did not initially accept Fitch's pronouncements, yet many laypeople did. Eventually and reluctantly Joshua V. Himes came to advocate Fitch's interpretation of the message in autumn 1844. William Miller himself never affirmed it, despite being disfellowshipped from his church.) George R. Knight (1999), A Brief History of Seventh-day Adventists, p20 : \\"While most Eastern Millerite leaders initially responded coolly to Fitch's call for separation, the aggressive reaction within the various denominations made it acceptable to many Advent believers as they faced increasing opposition and loss of membership. Himes did not become an advocate of separation until the autumn of 1844, and then only reluctantly. Miller could never bring himself to urge separation, even though the Low Hampton Baptist Church, where he was a member, eventually expelled him.\\" Stained-glass depiction of the Three Angels' Messages =Standard view= When Jesus did not return in 1844 as expected by the Millerite movement, the resulting Seventh- day Adventist movement came to see itself as the remnant of God and believed that their mission was to preach the three angels' messages again. The first angel's message is the \\"everlasting gospel\\", namely the \\"good news of God's infinite love\\". It is also a warning that the investigative judgment has begun and a call to worship the Creator of the world, specifically in the keeping of the Sabbath commandment. \\"The first angel's message ... calls for the restoration of true worship by presenting before the world Christ the Creator and Lord of the Bible Sabbath [which is] the sign of God's Creation.\\" The second angel's message is a call to those in Babylon to ‚Äúdepart from her‚Äù (cf. Revelation 18:4). Adventists traditionally believe that Babylon represents the apostate church, which they identify as Roman Catholicism as well as Protestants who have rejected the truth. \\"This prophecy of Babylon's fall especially finds its fulfillment in the departure of Protestantism at large from the purity and simplicity of the everlasting gospel of righteousness by faith that once so powerfully impelled the Reformation.\\" This explains why Adventists often aim their evangelism at Christians in other churches as well as non-Christians. \\"The message of the fall of Babylon ... calls on those of God's people who are still in the various religious bodies comprising Babylon to separate from them.\\" However, Adventists have also made it clear that there are currently many true believers in ‚ÄúBabylon‚Äù who worship God sincerely, including Roman Catholics. Theologian √Ångel Manuel Rodr√≠guez explains the mission of the remnant in terms of the second angel's message: \\"The end-time remnant is described in Revelation as having a God-given mission and a particular message to the whole world. They are to call the people of God to come out of Babylon, that is to say, to join the historical, faithful and visible end-time remnant of God.' The third angel's message is a solemn warning against observance of Sunday as a sacred day, which Adventists have historically interpreted as the mark of the beast. \\"Those who reject God‚Äôs memorial of creatorship‚Äîthe Bible Sabbath‚Äîchoosing to worship and honor Sunday in the full knowledge that it is not God's appointed day of worship, will receive the 'mark of the beast.'\\" Adventists believe that the mark of the beast will only be received at a future date, when every person on earth is made aware of their obligation to keep the Sabbath; in other words, Christians who currently worship on Sunday do not have the mark. =Alternate view= Some in the more liberal wing, Progressive Adventists, typically reject the claim that the three angels' messages find a fulfillment in the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Mainstream Adventists believe that God has led the Christian movements in history,For example, George Vandeman's book What I Like About...: The Lutherans, The Baptists, The Methodists, The Charismatics, The Catholics, Our Jewish Friends, The Adventists: Rescuers of Neglected Truth, in which he sees many groups restoring certain of God's \\"truths\\" but progressives tend to not hold to that view or at all. Progressive Adventists such as Steve Daily have challenged the traditional understanding of the Remnant, preferring to widen the concept to include Christians in non-Adventist churches. Culture The concept appears in the title of the Three Angels Broadcasting Network (3ABN). Luther's Bible.  Lutheran interpretation  Siebert Becker of the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod explained that some have held the angel in verse 6 to be Martin Luther. This is an example of historicism. Becker preferred the idealistic interpretation that the angel's work was not limited \\"to one specific time and one specific event.\\"page 4 of An Isagogical Treatment of the Revelation of St. John the Divine by Siegbert W. Becker This is in contrast to P. E. Kretzmann, who wrote:Popular Commentary, page 14 Kretzmann does not give a name to the other two angels.

The Yorkshire ArtSpace Society, originally established in Sheffield in 1977 by a group of artists, aimed to provide accessible studio space. At that time, the Society was based at Washington Works, but only on a short term lease. Subsequently, in 1982 a 10-year lease was obtained on Sydney Works, on Matilda Street, a four storey building which had formerly been a cutlery factory. After eight years of development the premises had been modified to include 30 studios with office and gallery space. It was the first arts organisation to move into this part of the City centre, later to become the Cultural Industries Quarter. The Society became the largest \\"artspace\\" in the country outside London. Persistence Works was designed by Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios. It is the UK‚Äôs first purpose built studio complex for artists and craftspeople. The project has created studio space for sixty eight practising artists and craftspeople in addition to exhibition, project, education and office spaces, The building won an RIBA Yorkshire White Rose award and a Civic Trust Award Commendation.

His book, Red Tail Captured, Red Tail Free: Memoirs of a Tuskegee Airman and POW, is a personal memoir of those who served America in World War II and after. Early life Jefferson was born in Detroit, Michigan, the eldest child of Alexander Jefferson and Jane White Jefferson. His maternal great-grandfather William Jefferson White was born to a slave woman and a white slave owner in the 1830s. Jefferson's grandfather became a minister, and in 1867, opened an all black ministry school for boys in Augusta, Georgia, which today is known as Morehouse College.

Parachuting to safety and landing within a forest, he was immediately captured by Nazi ground troops. He was sent to prisoner of war camp Stalag Luft III in Poland, a specialist Luftwaffe-run camp for captured Allied Air Force personnel. During his period of internment, Jefferson comments that he was treated like any other Air Force officer by his German captors. He was then moved to Stalag VII-A, just outside Dachau. After the Russian Army entered Poland, the prisoners were marched to Munich by the Germans, where they were freed by General George Patton's US Third Army. Jefferson returned to the United States on board the Cunard liner RMS Queen Mary, arriving in New York city in mid-1945: Postwar career Jefferson served as an instrument instructor at Tuskegee Army airfield, until it closed in 1946.

It was shot in Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona. Plot Katie Armstrong (Claudette Colbert) is a young widow and mother of three children - Charlie (Jimmy Hunt), Abner (Peter Miles) and Zoe (Gigi Perreau). She is also engaged to be married to botany professor Grant Jordan (Fred MacMurray). Grant is seeking funds to raise a new botany research building on the university campus where he works, and the most influential person to convince in this quest is his chancellor, Richard Fenster (Paul Harvey). Grant used to be involved with the chancellor's daughter, Minna (Rita Johnson), and is surprised when Minna crashes his bachelor party. Minna also almost succeeds in completely ruining Katie's engagement party. When Katie hears about Minna's visit at the bachelor party, Grant does his best to assure her that Minna is a finished chapter in his book, but he also has a hard time completely ignoring her, since he needs to be on good terms with the chancellor himself. Minna is obviously out to sabotage the relationship between Grant and Katie. While the couple are to get married and go away on honeymoon, Katie's sister Jo (Lillian Bronson) has agreed to look after the children. Right before the wedding, Jo injures herself in a domestic accident, preventing her from fulfilling her promise to look after the children. The newly wed couple have no other alternative than to bring the children with them on their honeymoon. This is where things start going wrong. Abner and Charlie abandon the train they're riding together, and disappear into the night at the stop in Porterville. When the rest of the family arrive at Junction City, they take a taxi back to Porterville to look for the missing brothers. In Porterville they find out that the brothers have left for Junction City with a traveling salesman. It soon turns out they never made it all the way, but hitched with a local farmer, Mr. Webb (Irving Bacon), to his home. The family is finally reunited and the next day they board a train bound for the Grand Canyon. When the family arrives at the Grand Canyon, Grant discovers that Minna and the chancellor are there too on vacation. Minna immediately starts working Grant, trying to spend as much time with him as possible, convincing him to show his preliminary sketches for a new botany building to her father. While this happens, Katie and the children are away on a horseback riding excursion. Katie meets the chancellor on her excursion, thus finding out about the Fensters' presence at the canyon. She returns to the lodge just in time to be invited by Minna, with Grant, to a dinner with her. When Katie is away getting her hair done, Minna surprises Grant with a visit when he is looking after the children. Coming back, Katie finds them both in the lodge together, and a quarrel between her and Grant ensues. Outraged, Grant leaves the lodge in a taxi, while Minna is contentedly watching. Soon after, Katie also leaves the lodge with the children, and when Grant returns, regretful, she is already gone. Since Katie has told her sister that she is on her way home, Jo decides to throw the happy couple a welcoming party. Upon her arrival, Katie is quite embarrassed by returning home alone to the party, and tries to speak with Jo in private. Minna and the chancellor turn up at the party, and Minna gloats in Katie's unfortunate position, believing that she is trying to escape the attention at the party.

Uses  Acacia salicina =Erosion management= Acacia salicina can be used to help stabilize riverbanks and other areas.Acacia Salicina =Fodder= The tree's foliage and seed pods are important fodder for livestock during dry periods, since the tree can withstand drought quite well. Its foliage and pods compare quite poorly to other fodders with regard to digestibility by livestock. This affects its available nutritional value.Acacia Search The 1889 book 'The Useful Native Plants of Australia‚Äô records that \\"The leaves are eaten by stock.

They were both teachers in Lancashire, England, for the majority of their creative achievements and most of their works have been written specially for St Augustine's RC High School, Billington. At the time Peter Rose was their head of music.  Notable works  Rose and Conlon's first collaboration was The Conversion Job (1980‚Äì1); a currently unpublished musical which told the story of Augustine and his monks as they tried to convert Britain to Christianity. This was first performed at St Augustine's RC High School. Their second collaboration was the choral piece The Kestrel Song (1982), which was later published by their publishers Josef Weinberger (1995). This piece describes > \\"the thoughts of a kestrel as it hovers above the motorway‚Ä¶ From the safety > of the sky, the Kestrel watches \\"all the madness of these men rushing > blindly onwards\\". The fog descends, but the traffic rushes on, until the > inevitable disaster happens1\\" The Kestrel Song won them the 1982 BBC Pebble Mill ‚Äì WWF Sounds Natural competition, which brought the writers to the attention of Ivan Hattingh, Head of Development at WWF-UK at the time. Shortly after this, Ivan Hattingh called the writers and asked them to write an extended musical, similar to The Kestrel Song, but about the Amazon Rainforest. Although it seemed an impossible task, they accepted and penned the first half of Yanomamo (1983), which described the beauties of the Amazon rainforest. By the second half, which contrasts the lighter first, the writers explore the human problems that existed in the Amazon basin at the time, and ask strong questions about western attitudes to tribal societies and our role in protecting such important and sensitive natural balances. Yanomamo is a 90-minute work for chorus, soloists, narrator and stage band, and the original production, performed by the choir and musicians of St Augustine's RC High School, was narrated by Sir David Attenborough and premiered at the Royal Institute, London, before appearing at the Edinburgh Festival. They later performed Yanomamo in America, narrated by Sting, which production was recorded for television and later broadcast (on Easter Sunday, 1989) on Channel 4 under the title of Song of the Forest. The TV version was commercially released by WWF. Since its publication the musical has seen performances by thousands of children throughout the world. This interest was also helped by the inclusion of Yanomamo as part of the BBC Radio Music Workshop series for schools (1991), including a short dramatic script specially written for the series by Conlon. After the TV adaption was broadcast, the school was officially recognised when two of the young soloists were presented to the Duke of Edinburgh and presented with the Ford European Conservation Award in the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. Rose and Conlon's next collaboration was in 1985 with Daughters of Pendle. This fully dramatic musical explores 16th-century witchcraft in Lancashire, and was first performed by St Augustine's RC High School. The show is currently unpublished. After the highly successful Yanomamo, Ivan Hattingh commissioned Rose and Conlon to write another musical, outlining the severe problems of migration from the countryside to the cities in developing countries. African Jigsaw (1986) was written and first performed by the choir and musicians of St Augustine's RC High School at the Barbican Concert Hall, London, narrated by actress Mary Miller and winning a Henry Ford Conservation Award2. African Jigsaw was also performed by the school at the Royal Festival Hall in 1987, this time with Sir Charles Groves and the Philharmonic Orchestra at a Royal Gala charity performance for the homeless. Again, this musical is a 90-minute work for chorus, soloists, narrator and stage band. African Jigsaw was later transmitted as a Splash Special by ITV in 1987, and also part of the ITV Middle English series. Conlon's narration explores the thoughts of one central character; an African mother who has stayed in the countryside whilst her son has started a new life for himself in the city. Three years later saw their third WWF commission, Ocean World (1990). This time they focused on the problems that threaten the existence of the sea. Ocean World tells the story of a female humpback whale as she journeys to her northern feeding grounds. We are with her at the birth to her first calf, and along her journey we meet other creatures of the deep who have their own problems to contend with. Ocean World premiered at the Royal Festival Hall by the choir and musicians of St Augustine's RC High School and was narrated by Sir David Attenborough. A television version, currently available from WWF-UK, was made and transmitted in 1991 as part of Channel 4's Fragile Earth series. The work follows the same pattern as their previous WWF commissions, and is a 90-minute work for chorus, soloists, narrator and stage band. Rose and Conlon are also known for writing work with a Christian message. In 1987, they were commissioned to write a Harvest Festival Anthem, \\"Care for your World\\", which was performed on BBC's Songs of Praise. Two years later, in March 1989 their hymns were featured in The Daily Service on BBC Radio 4. Rose and Conlon did not collaborate after this until 1996, with the publication of their hymn book Hymns for a Caring World, and their fourth WWF-UK commission Arabica, inspired by a conference Conlon attended about world economics. Arabica is a musical about the coffee industry and the people involved in the growing, producing and selling of it.\\"Musicals for schools\\", WWF. This was premiered at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London, by the choir and musicians of St Augustine's RC High School with narration by actor Burt Caesar. Arabica is arguably the most musically complex of their shows, and most controversial, and has never been broadcast. There was question whether they would write another large-scale musical after Arabica, but in 2000 they wrote Song of Creation to celebrate the millennium. Song of Creation, unlike their WWF musicals, was written for the catholic charity CAFOD, and premiered at the Royal Festival Hall, London. However, they kept their regular blueprint of writing for chorus, soloists, narrator and stage band. The original production of Song of Creation was narrated by Mary Miller, who also narrated their African Jigsaw in 1986. By contrast to their WWF musicals, Song of Creation has no story as such, yet explores the wonders of creation and of human initiative, at the same time addressing the question of human responsibility for this human drive. Effectively, Rose and Conlon's latest work completes their cycle of environmental musicals by exploring the whole of the world in which we live; the natural balances that occur (which are also explored particularly in Yanomamo with regards to the rainforest), and the linking together of Western and Developing cultures (which is a theme that runs throughout their work, especially in African Jigsaw). Two new works by Rose and Conlon premiered in 2009. The first, commissioned by Children's International Voices of Enfield, is a smaller piece, Caledonian Shadows, and was performed in London on Sunday 15 March. The second work is a full-length WWF-Commission, One Sun, One World and was performed at the Royal Albert Hall at the end of the year.\\"About One Sun One World musical\\", WWF.

In his second season, he became the starter at left cornerback, registering 52 tackles, 15 passes defensed, 2 blocked punts, a team leading 8 interceptions and recovered a blocked punt for a touchdown. In 1987, he played in only nine games after suffering a knee injury in training camp. In the NFC Divisional playoff game, he faced Jerry Rice and helped contain him to three receptions. He posted 18 tackles, 2 interceptions and 4 passes defensed. In 1988, he started the first 9 games before missing 3 of the next 4 contests with a bruised thigh. He was backup in the final 3 games of the regular season and in the playoffs. He made a last-minute game-saving interception in a 23‚Äì21 win against the Philadelphia Eagles. He registered 34 tackles, 2 interceptions, 20 passes defensed, one blocked punt and one safety. In 1989, he returned a 90-yard interception for a touchdown against the Detroit Lions. On October 12, he was sent to the Dallas Cowboys as part of the Herschel Walker trade. He started one game out of 5, making 5 tackles, one interception and 2 passes defensed. =Dallas Cowboys= In 1989, he didn't start because there were conditional draft picks attached to the Vikings traded players and the Dallas Cowboys wanted the selections instead of keeping Holt and the others. Head coach Jimmy Johnson eventually had second thoughts on the February 1 deadline and traded three future draft choices (third-round and tenth-round in 1990 and a third-round in 1991) to the Vikings for the right to retain the original full package of draft choices, plus Holt, Jesse Solomon and David Howard. He finished the season with 15 tackles and 2 passes defensed. In 1990, he was named the starter at left cornerback, collecting 53 tackles, 3 interceptions (tied for the team lead), 18 passes defensed (led the team) and 2 blocked punts. He missed the season opener against the Washington Redskins with a groin injury. In 1991, he posted 53 tackles, 4 interceptions (led the team), 21 passes defensed (led the team) and one blocked punt. The next year, he registered 11 starts, 30 tackles, 2 interceptions, 9 passes defensed, one safety and one blocked punt, while been a part of the Super Bowl XXVII Championship team. From 1990 to 1992, Holt became one of the top players on the team's defense at left cornerback, posting a total of 9 interceptions. On April 30, 1993, after Holt questioned the number of voluntary off-season workouts, he was released by Johnson, who was looking to send the team a message. He left as the Cowboys career leader with 4 blocked punts and was the last of the five players from the Herschel Walker trade still on the team. =Miami Dolphins= On June 10, 1993, Holt was signed as a free agent by the Miami Dolphins. He was cut on August 23.

An example could be a model posing for a photographer at a studio or an outdoor location. A photo shoot is a series of images that are taken, with the goal of obtaining images that can then be placed into post-production, or editing. These images are then used for print/digital advertising, business collateral, or just for personal use. An amateur photo shoot is more likely to be under the arrangement of Trade-For-Portfolio (TFP), whereas a professional photo shoot for a brand or product is likely to be a paid arrangement. With TFP photo shoots, the agreement is often that everyone involved in the shoot will receive the high-resolution, edited images as a form of payment. Sunday, August 23, 2020 With professional photo shoots, the contract is generally signed via a representative modelling agency and so payment is generally always monetary. Due to this, models may not be guaranteed to get the images returned to them as it is the property of the hiring firm/individual.

History The enactment of the Philippine Autonomy Act (popularly known as \\"Jones Law\\") in August 1916 by the United States Congress provided for the creation of a bicameral legislature consisting of a lower chamber (House of Representatives) and an upper chamber (Senate). Until then the Philippine Commission held the executive power and some legislative powers over the American colony. The system of government of the Philippines in its early years of transition to democratic self-government was deliberately structured to emulate the American model. The Philippines thus followed the American system of electing the members of the 24-seat senate by district. The districts were organized and numbered in a roughly north-south fashion, much like the present administrative regions. The first eleven districts were composed of established provinces, while the twelfth was composed of the provinces of the Luzon interior and much of Mindanao ‚Äî both of which were never fully administered by the old Spanish colonial government and designated by American authorities as \\"Non-Christian\\" areas. The first to eleventh districts elected two senators each by popular vote. The two senators from the twelfth district were appointed by the U.S. Governor-General. The setup lasted until the establishment of the Commonwealth of the Philippines in 1935, when the bicameral legislature was abolished, as the 1935 Constitution provided only for a unicameral National Assembly. However, when the Constitution was amended in 1940 to re-establish a bicameral Congress, members of the Senate had to be voted at-large, thereby effectively abolishing the district system.

She was Duchess of Bouillon by marriage. Biography After her father was murdered in 1584, there was a shortage of money for Elisabeth, her siblings and her stepmother Louise de Coligny. In 1594 Louise took Elisabeth with her to France, where they met with several Protestant nobles. One of them, Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, of the Duchy of Bouillon and the Principality of Sedan, sent her a proposal of marriage that she accepted. The couple had nine children. Henri tried to keep his Duchy Sedan Protestant, but had to deal with hostility emanating from his catholic French neighbors. During his absences Elisabeth acted as regent, and after his death in 1623 she became regent for their son Fr√©d√©ric Maurice de la Marck. She kept in close contact with her stepmother and five sisters, two of whom also acted as regents at some point.

The current location of the theater is at the new performance art center at 427 Franklin Street, in downtown Schenectady. The company has presented over 200 shows at various locations for over 90 years. The company presents amateur theater productions.  History of the Company  The Schenectady Light Opera Company (SLOC) was born in 1926 when a group of Van Corlaer and Draper alumni joined together to \\"present short plays containing songs and comedy acts.\\" The group, directed by Mrs. Etta Moore, a music teacher in the Schenectady City School District, was known as the Bellevue Young People's Chorus. The group first presented concerts and short operettas before moving on to the Gilbert and Sullivan shows, Trial by Jury and Patience, in 1933‚Äì1934. In 1936 the Bellevue Young People's Chorus changed its name to Schenectady Light Opera Company. In the spring of 1942 the Company disbanded for the duration of the war, due to the shortage of male members. In 1946 the group got together again and presented H.M.S. Pinafore at Mont Pleasant High School, the company's adopted home. The manpower situation still posed a problem. A note in the group's newsletter stated, \\"To maintain the balance of the parts, no new sopranos will be admitted unless they bring a male.\\" Another problem was storage. The company had accumulated vast quantities of costumes and sets, so a search was begun for a building SLOC could call \\"home.\\" The old Craig School on Balltown Road seemed ideal; however, the zoning laws, made it necessary to petition the State Supreme Court in order to allow a membership corporation to own property. That was successful, and henceforth, Craig School was to be known as the Opera House. Until 1950, productions were given at Mont Pleasant High School, with the exception of \\"road\\" shows to Cobleskill, Schoharie and East Greenbush. In November 1950, SLOC presented The Mikado, in the Erie Theater. \\"Move-in\\" became a SLOC tradition at the Erie. Friday night the sets were loaded at the Opera House and moved into the Erie after the late movie. Showboat was the last SLOC show at the Erie before it closed in 1956. Burnt Hills High School hosted The Merry Widow in 1957, and Finian's Rainbow became the first SLOC show in the new Niskayuna High School. In 1959, SLOC first ventured into modern opera with presentations of The Telephone, Down in the Valley and RSVP. SLOC later produced The Medium and Amelia Goes to the Ball. Although the theater continued to produce Gilbert and Sullivan in the 1950s, the productions of Brigadoon, Carousel, Showboat and Oklahoma! marked the transition from operetta to truly American musical theater. The 1960s produced SLOC's first attempts at modern musical comedy- The Music Man, Where's Charley?, Guys and Dolls, and Bye Bye Birdie -as well as the classics, The King and I, My Fair Lady, Kiss Me Kate, and South Pacific. The decade closed with the beautiful She Loves Me, and the exciting West Side Story. The 1970s opened with the comedy A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, and the operas Amahl and the Night Visitors and Help, Help, the Globolinks! The 1970s also brought productions of the popular Mame, Hello Dolly!, Annie Get Your Gun; Fiddler on the Roof and Gypsy. In 1971 SLOC sold the ‚ÄúOpera House‚Äù on Balltown Road and purchased the Beth Israel Synagogue at 826 State Street, Schenectady. Thus began the huge task of turning the building into a theater. In 1972 the new Opera House officially opened with Jacques Brel. This was the beginning of the cabaret shows with table seating and wine, bread and cheese. The SLOC season now included two shows at the Opera House, two shows at Niskayuna High School, as well as concerts, revues and workshops. In 1973 SLOC moved its set building operation to the Turn Verein gym located directly behind the Opera House. That closeness to our Opera House greatly aided all aspects of the technical needs for each production. In 1974 SLOC made an early contribution to the nation's Bicentennial with a production of 1776. The company's George M! was also an exciting tribute to our country, but also, in the SLOC tradition, a most appropriate way to help celebrate its 50th anniversary. In 1976-1977 we were still performing four shows- two at Niskayuna High School and two at the Opera House. During 1977-1978 SLOC purchased a nearby State Street building to use as its costume house. In April 1980 SLOC moved from, Niskayuna High School to Proctor's Theater, with Shenandoah, and continued its four-show season (two at the Opera house and two at Proctor's) until 1990 when SLOC did The Most Happy Fella at Proctor's Theater. In 1987 SLOC purchased a small building on Taurus Road in Niskayuna to use as its set-building facility. We no longer had to keep moving all our sets to rental venues. In the fall of 1990 SLOC performed one more show at Niskayuna High School and then began performing only at the Opera House until presenting its 70th anniversary celebration in 1996 with a birthday bash at Proctor's. In April 2010, SLOC purchased several buildings from the Albany Catholic Diocese that were St John the Baptist, between Franklin and Liberty Streets in Schenectady. This was a major undertaking in order to have sufficient space for performing, rehearsal, storage of costumes and equipment, on-site office and meeting needs, live-in property manager, rentals, plus parking and future additions for set construction and storage. It also is much nicer for audiences, production teams and other volunteers, since it is handicapped accessible, has convenient parking, restaurants within walking distance and is in Schenectady's developing arts district. After SLOC purchased its new home, the Northeast Ballet Company also needed a new home and moved in as a lease tenant in October 2010. This fit the vision SLOC's Board and members had of creating a small performing arts complex for local groups. NEB has expanded their lease space as they have grown in the SLOC performing arts complex. The opening production in February 2011 in the new theater complex was The Drowsy Chaperone, which played to packed houses. Many reviewers have written that the quality of SLOC's productions achieved a higher level since being in the new theater. Since opening at its new theater, SLOC has presented highly acclaimed and award-winning productions including: The Drowsy Chaperone, Les Mis√©rables (Youth Production), Hairspray, Fiddler on the Roof, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, Guys and Dolls, Caroline, or Change, The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee (Directed by a high school student), and Young Frankenstein. SLOC has expanded its resources to offer youth the opportunity to develop their performing, technical and artistic skills with productions and workshops. SLOC's future plans are to improve the facilities with a new lobby and a set construction and storage facility. The SLOC Board of Directors has developed a new strategic plan, which provides guidance for operational improvements to strive for success internally as well as for its customers.  High School Awards Program  SLOC holds an annual High School Awards program in which a committee of SLOC board members observe high school shows, then later in the year awards excellent performers and the top three high school musicals in the Capital District.

During his playing days he was nicknamed \\"Bam-Bam,\\" after the eponymous character from The Flintstones, for his tackling and physicality. After retiring from the NFL, Ambrose became an attorney and has been a judge of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas since 2004. Football career A graduate of Iona Prep, Ambrose played college football at the University of Virginia and earned All-ACC (first-team) honors during his junior and senior seasons. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Education from Virginia. In the 1975 NFL draft he was drafted by the Cleveland Browns in the 12th round (290th overall). Ambrose played ten seasons with the Cleveland Browns and was starting middle/right linebacker during the late 1970s to early 1980s before injuries curtailed his career. As a 12th-round pick, he would have been an undrafted free agent in the present day and was not considered to be a starter. He stepped in as an injury replacement and became starting middle linebacker despite being a rookie. He was part of the 1980 team known as the \\"Kardiac Kids\\" which won the division title for the first time since 1971 but lost in the divisional playoffs by a mere two points to the Oakland Raiders. His final season (1984) was spent on the injured reserve list, prompting his eventual retirement. He was popularly known as \\"Bam Bam\\" for his hard-nosed tackling and physical skills. The Plain Dealer ranked him number 94 in its special feature of the Browns' top 100 all- time greats. Legal career Ambrose began his legal studies while still playing football for the Cleveland Browns, graduating magna cum laude in 1987 from Cleveland‚ÄìMarshall College of Law. After graduating from Cleveland- Marshall, he joined the firm of McDonald Hopkins. He has also been associated with the firms of Chriszt McGarry Co. and Nicola Gudbranson and Cooper. He was the presiding judge in the trial of Anthony Sowell, the Cleveland serial killer who was found guilty on 82 charges. On August 12, 2011, Ambrose sentenced Sowell to death.

Introduction  Over 1000 such organizations are active in over 100 countries around the world, mostly in the United States, Europe and Asia. Many of them are organized by local government bodies together with not-for-profit organisations and the like, and serve as the administrative window concerned with attracting and supporting the productions that come to their locality, not only from other parts of their own countries, but from abroad, as well. The Association of Film Commissioners International or AFCI is based in Los Angeles.AFCI.org The mission of the AFCI is to be essential to the advancement and promotion of excellence in the global production of media on location, in an ethical and professional manner, and to this end the organization sets standards and provides professional education, training and business services in the field of Film Commissioning. The European Film Commissions Network or EUFCN www.eufcn.com is based in Bruxelles. The Asian Film Commissions Network or AFCNet www.afcnet.org gathers now film commissions on the Asian continent. A major industry event and trade show is the Locations Trade Show which is organised by the AFCI. In 2011 the Locations Show was produced in association with the Producers‚Äô Guild of America's Produced By Conference. Film commissions believe that by attracting productions to their area they can provide direct economic benefit through rental of hotel rooms, locations, vehicles, etc., and indirect economic benefit via the increased exposure of appearing in films and television. History \\"The first Commission was formed in the United States during the late 1940s. This was in response to the need for film companies to have a local government liaison who could coordinate local services such as police, state troopers and highway patrols, road and highway departments, fire departments, park rangers and all of the other essential municipal and government services for shooting a production on location. As more production companies began to look beyond the limits of a regular production center for realistic and varied locations, more cities and states began to see the need for production coordination liaison.\\"McDonald, Paul, and Janet Wasko. The Contemporary Hollywood Film Industry. Malden, MA: Blackwell Pub., 2008. 55 Economics Film commissions can benefit both the production company and the area they decide to shoot at. The production company can potentially save money by shooting out of state and hiring cheaper below-the-line labor, shooting on location as opposed to building a set in a studio, etc. The economy at the location they shoot at can benefit via profits from hotel rooms, food, gas stations, and any other amenities that the above- the-line labor will use throughout the duration of the filming.McDonald, Paul, and Janet Wasko. The Contemporary Hollywood Film Industry. Malden, MA: Blackwell Pub., 2008. 55 However, shooting out of Hollywood does affect those who still work in Hollywood. Below-the-line workers based in Hollywood have a smaller job market because production continues to move out of state.

His only senior club was Aberdeen, with whom he played for 14 years. He also represented Scotland during their first FIFA World Cup finals appearance in 1954. Club career Originally signed from Carnoustie Panmure as an inside forward, Martin was converted into a goalkeeper during his period of National Service. He made his Aberdeen debut in his new position in a 3‚Äì1 defeat by East Fife in 1949‚Äì50, scoring an own goal when he fumbled a last minute cross into his net. He recovered from this start and became a regular over the next seven seasons, helping the Dons to their first League title in 1954‚Äì55 and the 1955‚Äì56 League Cup. Martin also featured in three Scottish Cup finals for the Reds (1952‚Äì53, 1953‚Äì54 and 1958‚Äì59), although he was on the losing side on each occasion. The latter years of his time at Pittodrie saw Martin fall victim to a succession of injuries and after making only four appearances during the season, he retired at the end of the 1959‚Äì60 campaign. Scotland career Martin was chosen to represent the Scottish Football League in 1952 and two years later earned his first full Scotland cap in a 1‚Äì0 win against Norway, making his debut alongside Dons teammates Paddy Buckley and George Hamilton. He was selected in the Scotland squad for the 1954 World Cup and played in both Scotland's matches, a 1‚Äì0 defeat by Austria and a 7‚Äì0 defeat by Uruguay. Martin was considered partially responsible for scale of the Uruguayan defeat and dropped, with his inconsistency being highlighted in the media. In the opinion of Scottish football journalist and historian Bob Crampsey \\"when the mood was upon him, he could be very good, but at other times, played exactly as you would expect an inside-right to play if shoved between the posts.\\" Martin was recalled for games against Hungary and England in late 1954 and early 1955 but on each occasion Scotland lost heavily (4‚Äì2 and 7‚Äì2 respectively) and his international career was effectively over. He conceded a total of 20 goals in his six games for Scotland. Post football After retiring from football, Martin went into the whisky trade and worked for Dewar's Whisky until he retired in 1994. In 2007, he was one of the inaugural inductees into the Aberdeen Football Club Hall of Fame in recognition of his achievements and legendary status at the club. He died in August 2013 at the age of 84.

Millais witnessed the death of a fireman in the course of a rescue, and decided to depict the subject. The fire brigade had only recently been transformed from private businesses dedicated to the protection of property to a public institution charged to protect life first.John A. Walker, The People's Hero: Millais's The rescue and the image of the fireman in nineteenth-century art and media, Apollo, Dec, 2004. Millais sought to create the correct effects of light and smoke by using a sheet of coloured glass and by burning planks of wood. This emphasis on fleeting effects of colour and light was a new departure in his art. The painting is also notable for its startling transitions of colour, particularly the dramatic effect by which the sleeve of the mother's nightgown changes from slatey blue to pale pink. This led to much critical comment at the time.Malcolm Warner, Millais' The rescue, in Leslie Paris (ed.), \\"The Pre-Raphaelites\\", London, 1984, pp. 131-33. Robyn Cooper argues that some criticism of the painting arose from the fact that it depicted a virile working class man rescuing middle class children, while their father is nowhere to be seen.

Early life and education Chaison was born in 1943 to Alfred and Ada Chaison, a Jewish family living in Brooklyn. He obtained his bachelor's degree in 1965 and his Master of Business Administration in 1966, both from the City College of New York. He received his Ph.D. in 1972 from SUNY-Buffalo. He is married to historian Joanne Danaher Chaison, a former American Antiquarian Society research librarian.Anonymous. Alamanac - AAS Newsletter, Number 75, Summer 2008 While still working on his doctorate, Chaison was appointed a lecturer at Baruch College in 1968 and in 1970 an assistant professor at SUNY-Buffalo. In 1973, Chaison was named an assistant professor at the University of New Brunswick. He was promoted to associate professor in 1977. In 1979, Chaison became a visiting professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Chaison was appointed professor of management studies at Clark University in 1981. Research focus Chaison's research focus has been on union mergers and the impact these have on union viability, union democracy, and perceptions of legitimacy. His first book, When Unions Merge (1986), examined the motivations for merger, barriers to merger, negotiations leading to merger, the nature of merger agreements, various mechanisms by which agreements are approved or disapproved by union officers and union members, the governing structures of merged unions, and the outcomes of mergers. Chaison distinguished between two categories of merger: Amalgamation (the joining two or more unions of roughly equal size into a new union) and absorption (in which a small union merges into a large union and loses its identity).Roberts, \\"Book Reviews: Union Mergers in Hard Times: The View from Five Countries,\\" Monthly Labor Review, May 1997. The book generated a cottage industry of labor scholars scrutinizing union mergers, and led Chaison to be called the \\"major scholar of union mergers...\\"Moody, \\"Does Size Matter? Strategy and Quality of Leadership Are More Important,\\" Labor Notes, February 2003. In 1996, Chaison followed up this groundbreaking work with a transnational study of union mergers, Union Mergers in Hard Times: The View from Five Countries. In this work, Chaison turned his attention to the effectiveness of union mergers. He concluded that mergers do not solve the fundamental problems facing labor unions (such as organizing large numbers of new members or combating the negative effects of globalization), but they do enable unions to rationalize jurisdictions, and to devote more resources to organizing and building political power. In 2002, Chaison and co-author Barbara Bigelow examined the role legitimacy plays in the life of a union. The question of legitimacy flowed from Chaison's prior examination of union mergers. Did mergers negatively affect a labor organization's legitimacy in the eyes of its members, or in the eyes of the public? And if merger did so, what was the impact on the union's effectiveness in the various fields (such as organizing, servicing and collective bargaining) in which the union was active? In Unions and Legitimacy, Chaison and Bigelow argued that the concept of legitimacy provided a framework for understanding the sources of union strengths and weaknesses, and why some union survival strategies have failed.Reynolds, \\"Review: Unions and Legitimacy,\\" Relations Industrielles/Industrial Relations, September 2002. Chaison and Bigelow concluded that there were three ways in which legitimacy could be obtained: legal recognition, employer recognition, and public approval. Chaison and Bigelow, however, distinguished these three types further by arguing that there are two kinds of legitimacy: Pragmatic legitimacy, which is essentially an assessment of a union's effectiveness, and moral legitimacy, which conferred when people or organization outside the union treats the union as a socially valuable actor. Reviewers called the work \\"...a fresh and lucid discussion of legitimacy as it applies to labor unions and their role in society.\\"Reynolds, \\"Revitalizing Movement,\\" Monthly Labor Review, March 2003. Chaison recently published his first textbook, Unions in America. Rather than a historic survey, the 2005 work discusses labor unions in the here-and-now by examining what unions do and why they do it. The textbook covers governance structures, how unions organize, the basic strategies of collective bargaining, and how unions attempt to exercise political influence. The book also assesses emerging and continuing trends in organizing, collective bargaining, and union political action. =Media influence= Despite his relatively low level of academic output, Chaison is widely cited in the mass media. He has been interviewed by such major American newspapers as The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, The Christian Science Monitor, and USA Today, as well as mass-market international media sources such as the Associated Press and MSNBC. His popularity with the mainstream press led a consortium of central Massachusetts universities and colleges to cite his output specifically as an asset to the community. The reach of Chaison's media voice was particularly noted: \\"An article on the janitors' strike in Los Angeles had a combined circulation of over 9.2 million, and his quotes about the Verizon strike were picked up by over 90 newspapers across the country.\\"Colleges of Worcester Consortium, \\"Educated Workforce,\\" in Discover the Intellectual Capital of Central Massachusetts, 2005, p. 10. In part, Chaison is utilized as a resource by the mainstream press because he is noticeably pessimistic about the future of the American labor movement.

They belonged to the tribe of Bani Khalid. Their most prominent ruler was Ajwad ibn Zamil, who died in 1507. He was described by his contemporaries as having been \\"of Najdi origin.\\" Ajwad's elder brother had earlier established the dynasty in the early 15th century by deposing and killing the last Jarwanid ruler in Qatif. At their height, the Jabrids controlled the entire Arabian coast on the Persian Gulf, including the islands of Bahrain, and regularly led expeditions into central Arabia and Oman. One contemporary scholar described Ajwad ibn Zamil as \\"the king of al-Ahsa and Qatif and the leader of the people of Najd.\\" Following his death, his kingdom was divided among some of his descendants, with Migrin ibn Zamil (possibly his grandson) inheriting al-Hasa, Qatif, and Bahrain. Migrin fell in battle in Bahrain in a failed attempt to repel an invasion of Bahrain by the Portuguese in 1521. The Jabrid kingdom collapsed soon afterwards on the mainland, after an invasion of al-Hasa by Muntafiq tribe of Basrah, and later by the Ottoman Turks. One branch of the Jabrids remained active in Oman, however, for nearly another three centuries. It is unknown for sure what became of the non-Omani Jabrids. Some believe they left to Iraq, while others believe they are identical with the Jubur section of the Bani Khalid confederation, who eventually took control of the region after the Jabrids.
