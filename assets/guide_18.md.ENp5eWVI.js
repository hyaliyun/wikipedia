Ishulutaq participated in the rise of print and tapestry making in Pangnirtung and was a co-founder of the Uqqurmiut Centre for Arts & Crafts, which is both an economic and cultural mainstay in Pangnirtung. Ishulutaq was also a community elder in the town of Pangnirtung. Ishulutaq's work has been shown in numerous institutions, including the Marion Scott Gallery in Vancouver, the Winnipeg Art Gallery and the National Gallery of Canada. Ishulutaq saw herself as a bridge between generations, using visual representations to pass on the wisdom of her community's elders. In 2014, Ishulutaq was awarded the Order of Canada \\"for her contributions to the cultural and economic health of her community as a role model and mentor\\". Early life and family Elisapee Ishulutaq was born 1925 in Kangirterjuak Camp, Northwest Territories. In the 1930s Ishulutaq lived off the land of Baffin Island near Cumberland Sound with her family, including her mother Avurnirq, father Arnaqua, sister Malaya, and adopted brother Silassie Arnaquq. Although little is known about her early life, as a child she lived a nomadic hunting life which is the source of her inspiration in many of her later works. Elisapee Ishulutaq started her artistic career relatively late in life, after she moved to Pangnirtung at the age of forty- five. Ishulutaq's oil stick drawing Nunagah (2009) portrays many members of Ishulutaq's family including her parents, her siblings, her husband Kanayuk, and firstborn son Lasalucie. Jaco Ishulutaq, another of Ishulutaq's sons (not depicted in Nunagah), has become a well known carver in Pangnirtung. Political focus In addition to her works documenting her childhood, some of Elisapee Ishulutaq's recent work deals with two arctic political agendas: advocacy for the suicide crisis within Inuit communities in the arctic, and environmentalism. =Works related to Inuit suicide= Ishulutaq's work In His Memory (2016) depicts scenes from her community in the 1990s after a young boy committed suicide. It is a 9-metre-long drawing split into four images: (1) people leaving a grave; (2) mourners walking towards a church; (3) a figure standing on shore in front of a boat; and (4) a figure lying alongside a seated woman with the subtitle Vigil with Bird. While making the art piece, Ishulutaq encouraged children into the room to make their own drawings with her. About In His Memory, Ishulutaq has said that: \\"I drew it so that young people would not choose suicide as a solution to their problems\\". In His Memory was exhibited in the Marion Scott Gallery/Kardosh Projects in Vancouver in 2016. News organisations such as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the Vancouver Sun reported on the project. =Works related to environmentalism= Some of Ishulutaq's works focus on climate change such as the work titled Climate Change (2012). Ishulutaq has commented on environmentalism in art as follows: > \\"When I was young the ice was not dangerous... now it's getting dangerous, > and through art artists can get it out there, sharing that the ice is > getting dangerous. Nowadays hunters don't really listen to elders for their > knowledge or wisdom and having some sort of visual aid like art would really > put a clearer picture into what the elders are trying to say.\\" Ishulutaq also appears in Zacharias Kunuk and Ian Mauro's film Inuit Knowledge and Climate Change (2010). This is the first Inuktitut-language film that addresses global warming, considering Inuit traditional knowledge and its role in discourse of environmentalism. Artistic career Elisapee Ishulutaq worked primarily in oil stick since 2009, however she began drawing with colored pencils in 1960. At the age of 45 Ishulutaq moved to Pangnirtung, and began to contribute illustrations to the Pangnirtung print and tapestry workshops. Ishulutaq has been a contributor to the Pangnirtung print and tapestry workshops for 40 years, as long as the arts and crafts industry has existed in Pangnirtung. Ishulutaq was also one of the original contributors to the Pangnirtung annual catalogue of prints. Ishulutaq is the last living artist to have contributed to this original catalogue that was published in 1973. For her drawings that have been translated into prints, Ishulutaq collaborated on many occasions with artist Paul Machnik, the founder of PM Studios in Montreal. =Artistic inspiration= Many of her recent oil stick drawings are large-scale pieces; for example, her work In His Memory (2016) is 30 meters long, and Nunagah (2009) is 5 feet tall and 30 feet long. Her works often depict autobiographical scenes, which differs from common Inuit subject matter of contemporary life. Ishulutaq's works often explore the hardships she faced growing up. Ishulutaq's works are characterised by her use of multiple perspectives in the same image and focus on everyday life. Ishulutaq claims that the concept of legacy was her initial incentive for the creation of art: > \\"The main reason for making art being that the future generations could see > my work... I would leave a footprint so to speak... to be able to share > history through images.\\" Ishulutaq believed that art can help bridge the gap between elders and the younger generation, using visual motifs to pass along knowledge that would otherwise have been lost. She has also said that art was therapeutic and could help an individual work through anxieties. Ishulutaq remained an active participant in the Pangnirtung workshop until her death, continuing to explore new styles of art and new media. =Early works= Ishulutaq began contributing to the print workshop in 1970–1971. Early prints from Ishulutaq's drawings often included multiple perspectives, and large solitary figures of people, birds, and people, floating on a neutral background. During the establishment of the Tapestry Studio in Pangnirtung in the early 1970s, Ishulutaq and Malaya Akulukjuk were the workshop's sole illustrators. Ishulutaq's drawings were included in the first exhibition of Pagnirtung tapestries, In the Beginning, which was held in 1972 at the Canadian Guild of Crafts in Montreal. This exhibition included Ishulutaq's drawing Woman, which was woven by Oleepa Papatsie-Brown. =Recent works= In 2009, Ishulutaq created the work Nunagah (My Home Place) as part of the 2012 Canadian Biennial with the National Gallery of Canada. The Biennial was entitled \\"Builders\\" referring to the contribution of artists such as Ishulutaq to contemporary art and art mentorship. In 2014, Ishulutaq was commissioned to create a mural titled Yesterday and Today for the Winnipeg Art Gallery. This mural features scenes of the artist's everyday life and was commissioned by curator Darlene Coward Wight, who said this of Ishulutaq's work: > \\"Her use of multiple perspectives, employing frontal, profile, and bird’s > eye view in the same image is also characteristic, and these unexpected > shifts add interests and liveliness to her detailed scenes.\\" In 2016, Ishulutaq was commissioned to create the mural In His Memory as a memorial to the suicide of a young boy in her community. This piece was created in collaboration with the students of the local school as well as the artists Paul Machnik and his daughter Maica Armata-Machnik. This mural was reportedly Ishulutaq's \\"finale\\", as the then-91-year-old artist claimed that she would no longer participate in any large-scale creations. In 2013, Ishulutaq illustrated Vera Avic's Inuit children's story Trip to the Moon. Ishulutaq also continued to provide drawings for the yearly Pangnirtung Print Collection. In 2010, the collection contained 2 of Ishulutaq's drawings. The drawings depicted a scene from Pangnirtung and a streetscape of condominiums in Vancouver from a trip Ishulutaq took to British Columbia for an exhibition. The 2011 collection also included Ishulutaq's International Formation: Two Canadians, one American & one German Fly the Arctic. Death Ishulutaq died on 9 December 2018 at her home in Pangnirtung, aged 93. Awards Ishulutaq was part of the Pangnirtung experimental graphic workshop from 1970–1971. Shortly after in the year of 1973 at the California College of Arts and Crafts International Print Competition she won the award of merit for the design of her print \\"Three Bears\\". Her most notable award was in 2013, when she was made a member of the Order of Canada.

Since 1976 he has been living in Vienna, Austria. He is a member of the LGBT organisation Homosexuelle Initiative Wien (HOSI Wien). Since 1982, he has been the chairman of EEIP (Eastern Europe Information Pool), as part of ILGA. He has been responsible for collecting and archiving an open, official, and accessible collection of media and publication sources about the situation of gays and lesbians in Eastern Europe until 1989. In 1984 he published a monograph about his research: * (1984) Rosa Liebe unter dem Roten Stern: zur Lage d. Lesben u. Schwulen in Osteuropa, Published by: Frühlings Erwachen in Hamburg, Since 1983, he has supported the creation and development of the Polish gay and lesbian movement. Beginning in 1983, he started writing and spreading information among Polish gays with an illegal newsletter entitled Etap, which later gave the name to the first LGBT clandestine group in Wrocław. In a 1984 edition, he first used the term gej in order to create a neutral sounding Polish substitution for homosexual to substitute for the many derogatory words that existed. Since then it has been a broadly accepted term in the Polish language. From 1987 to 1988 he was a consultant for the Warszawski Ruch Homoseksualny (Warsaw Gay Movement). As there were no books about being LGBT, and the issue was completely taboo in Polish media, he started translating and editing (from English and German) classical and well-known homoerotic literature (Wilde, Baldwin, etc.). Starting in 1990 he cooperated for 10 years with the editorial staff of the Polish magazine Inaczej in Poznań, regularly writing articles and essays. In Poland, he published books referring to LGBT themes: * (1993): Leksykon kochających inaczej.

They constitute a small and rather primitive family with five extant genera and 13–20 living species. They may be a nuisance, but compared to the drywood termites (Kalotermitidae), usually do not cause extensive damage to buildings or other man-made structures. As their name implies, they eat wood that is not dried out, perhaps even rotting, and consequently of little use to humans. Taxonomy In 2009, the five extant genera from the family Termopsidae (Archotermopsis, Hodotermopsis, Porotermes, Stolotermes, and Zootermopsis) were moved to a newly created family, Archotermopsidae (Zootermopsis had previously been treated as part of the family Hodotermitidae), so that the family Termopsidae now includes only fossil taxa: Asiatermes, Huaxiatermes, and Mesotermopsis (Early Cretaceous of China); Cretatermes carpenteri (Upper Cretaceous of Labrador); Lutetiatermes prisca (Upper Cretaceous amber of France); Paleotermopsis oligocenicus (Upper Oligocene of France); Parotermes insignis (Oligocene of Colorado); and Valditermes (incertae sedis).

Biography Bishop was born at Fort Benning, Georgia on July 30, 1955, to John Bishop, a soldier, and Geraldine (née Han) Bishop. He studied physical therapy at Montana State University and the University of Montana. He worked at his family's equipment rental business in Butte, Montana. Climbing Bishop achieved recognition in the climbing community for his ascents of many exceptionally demanding routes, such as the Eiger peak in the Bernese Alps. However, much of his climbing efforts were concentrated in the Teton Range in the northwestern United States. He made several ascents of the many peaks in this range, many of them by free solo climbing and some during winter. Bishop was a prominent climbing guide in the Tetons and published a handbook for climbers in the area, Butte's Climbing Guide. Death During an attempt to free solo the Grand Traverse climbing route of the Grand Teton peak and several other peaks within a single day, Bishop fell to his death on July 16, 2004; his body was found after a two-day search. Many of his fellow climbers expressed surprise at his unlikely death on a mountain with which he had extensive experience and was well within his skill range. His ashes were scattered in the Grand Tetons. Other ventures Bishop was an avid long-distance cyclist and competed in the Race Across America cycling contest in 1993 and 2000.

She invented a furnace that supplied central heating for homes and entire buildings. Parker was from Morristown, New Jersey. She died in 1920 as a result of a heat stroke.  Education  She attended Howard University Academy, a high school located in Washington D.C. that was affiliated with Howard University and was granted a certificate with honors in 1910.  Career  Alice's patent for heating furnace was filed in 1919, not long after World War I. During the early 20th century, women had very limited opportunities, let alone women of color; racial and sexual discrimination was still prevalent. At the time, Parker receiving a patent for her invention as both a woman and an African American was truly unusual and an outstanding achievement for her and a new inspired generation of African American women. = Invention = The main point that Parker solved was staying warm in the winter time without having to chop wood and make a fire. Her invention also has better circulation of heat versus the standard fireplace. Parkers central heating furnace was patented on December 23, 1919. Her heating furnace was different from the other furnaces around at that time. People no longer needed to stock and burn wood, making this invention safer and less time consuming. Her design had air ducts that allowed heat to spread throughout the structure. Parker's invention included a multiple burner system and used natural gas. What made it especially unique is that it was like later zone heating, where the temperature could be moderated in different areas of a building. Parkers invention also decreased the risk of house or building fires that heating units posed by eliminating the need to leave a burning fireplace on throughout the night. Alice did not actually invent the gas furnace but she was eligible to get a patent on her heating system because it used independently controlled units that allowed the user to control the amount of heat in different areas of the building. = Problem = Even though this invention solved a lot of problems, it also created some. The main issue was that the furnace is very flammable and can catch on fire if something went wrong. Although unlikely, the heating tank can actually explode. This invention could also burn you if you accidentally touched the vent where heat is exported. Because of this problem her exact design was never implemented due to these safety issues with the regulation of heat flow. = Impact = Starting in 1885, coal was used more to burn than wood. Before then, most households depended on burning wood for their fireplaces and stoves. Parker’s invention was further improved in 1935 by scientists who created forced convection wall heaters that use a coal furnace, electric fan, and ductwork throughout a home. Nowadays we use a thermostat and a forced air furnace in our homes which can be attributed to Alice’s design and invention of the central heating furnace.The NJ Chamber named its “Women Leaders in Innovation” award after her. It can be noted that without Parker’s invention of the central heating furnace we could be heating our houses in a very different way. Today, Parker does not get enough credit as an inventor of something that everyone uses today and is vital to our modern day life.  Personal Life  Not much else is known about Parker's life. A review of census data available from that time suggests she was born in Virginia, and later moved to New Jersey. She was employed as a live-in cook in Morristown, NJ and her husband was the butler.

Her debut publication, \\"What Stops a Woman from Becoming Independent?\\" (published by Biblioteka Dlya Chtenya in September 1863) came as a direct response to Nikolai Chernyshevsky's novel What Is to Be Done?.Vilenskaya, E. and Roitberg, I. Memoirs of the Woman of the Sixties / Воспоминания шестидесятницы. Foreword to: At the Dawn of Life / На заре жизни (Том первый) Серия литературных мемуаров М., \\"Художественная литература\\", 1964 How People of Different Nations Live. The English, 1897, illustrated by Viktor Vasnetsov Many of Vodovozova's ideas originated during an extensive trip over Belgium, Germany, England, Switzerland and France which she and her husband Vasily Ivanovich undertook soon after their marriage in April 1862, in order to investigate the theories of Friedrich Fröbel and how they worked in practice. Her influential book \\"Intellectual Development of Children\\" (Умственное развитие детей от первого появления сознания до восьмилетнего возраста, 1871) enjoyed seven re-issues in pre-1917 Russia. A strong proponent of the idea of the active use of music and games as educational and developmental means, she published a book \\"Russian Folk Songs for One Voice and Active Games for Children\\" (Одноголосые детские песни и подвижные игры с русскими народными мелодиями, 1876) as a supplement to her own educational program. Highly popular at the time were Vodovozova's children's stories. Many of them were collected in her books From Russian Life and Nature (Из русской жизни и природы, 1871—1872) and For Leisure (На отдых, 1880). For decades Vodovozova's most important work was considered to be her magnum opus The Life of the Peoples of Europe. Narratives in Geography (Жизнь европейских народов. Географические рассказы, 1875—1883), reissued in ten volumes as \\"How People of Different Nations Live\\" (Как люди на белом свете живут, 1894—1901). In retrospect, though, the truly lasting part of her legacy proved to be her numerous memoirs and biographical sketches. Much lauded were her books Among the Petersburg Youth of the Sixties (Среди петербургской молодёжи шестидесятых годов, 1911) and Things Long Gone (Из давнопрошедшего, 1915). Vodovozova's best biographical and analytical works, including the essays on Konstantin Ushinsky, Vasily Sleptsov and Vasily Semevsky (her second husband whom she married in 1886, after Vodovozov's death), were collected in her two best-known books, At the Dawn of Life (На заре жизни, 1911) and Dreams and Reality (Грёзы и действительность, 1918).Русские писатели. 1800 — 1917.

Her work combines Navajo and Pueblo art traditions.  Early years  Born Christine Nofchissey in 21 December 1948 in Morenci, Arizona, the fifth of nine children of Mark and Ethel Yazzie Nofchissey, McHorse lived off of a reservation in her childhood but spent summers in Fluted Rock, Arizona, herding sheep and learning about Navajo lore from her grandmother, Zonith Bahe. McHorse was introduced to Picasso, Gaudi and Matisse at the boarding school she attended at age 14, which she says \\"opened a whole new world to us\\" (referring to herself and older sisters who were also attending the school). From 1963-1968, she studied at the Institute of American Indian Arts (IAIA) in Santa Fe, New Mexico when it was a high school for the arts on the campus of the Santa Fe Indian School. Originally intending to study glassblowing, she chose to study ceramics when the glassblowing major was discontinued the year she arrived, studying with Ralph Pardington (ceramics), Charles Loloma (jewelry), Allan Houser (foundry arts) and Fritz Scholder (design). She met her future husband Joel P. McHorse at IAIA and was influenced by her future grandmother-in-law, Lena Archuleta of Taos Pueblo, to begin working with ceramics. Archuleta inspired and instructed McHorse in using the shimmering micaceous clay that was common to the Taos area, and McHorse continues to use that clay in her work.  Personal life  In 1969 McHorse married Joel P. McHorse, a Taos Pueblo Indian and fellow art student whom she met at the Institute of American Indian Arts (IAIA). They had two children, Joel Christopher and Jonathan Thomas, originally living in Taos but later moving to Sante Fe.  Artwork and recognition  McHorse's artwork combines Navajo, Pueblo, and Anglo cultures. McHorse's pottery uses a traditional coil-building method and she bases her work on traditional Navajo designs and legends, influenced by the Pueblo artistry but her work is nontraditional in appearance. Much of her work has a signature black surface, created by depriving the clay of oxygen during firing and making her creations popular in contemporary art venues. She prefers to do the firing in the traditional mode but uses the electric kiln for pre-firing larger pieces, some up to 2 feet, to prevent the chance of breakage. She uses cedarwood and cottonwood bark as fuel for her traditional firing. Although in Navajo pottery tradition boiled pinon-pine pitch is applied on the surface of fired pots for waterproof, McHorse uses it more for incised design to create contrast.. Her large pottery has the sound of glass when tapped. McHorse was a participant in the Santa Fe Indian Market for 23 years, winning 38 awards for both pottery and sculpture. Her work can be found in the permanent collections of the Heard Museum, the Denver Art Museum, the National Museum of the American Indian, Navajo Nation Museum, and more. McHorse's work is also featured in the book Dark Light: The Ceramics of Christine Nofchissey McHorse (Fresco Fine Art Publications). = Awards =  From the Santa Fe Indian Market  * Best in Division, 1994 * Best of Classification Award in sculpture, 2001 * Challenge Award * Best Sculpture- first time the award had been won by a potter rather than a sculptor *Denver Annual Pottery Show, first prize, 1985 *Inter-Tribal Indian Ceremonial, Gallup, New Mexico, first place, 1987, 1989, 199 = From the Museum of Northern Arizona's Navajo Craftsmen Exhibition = * \\"Best of Show\\" award, 1990  Individual exhibitions  * 1993: Andrea Fisher Fine Pottery, Santa Fe, NM  Group exhibitions *1972: Taos Pueblo Arts and Crafts Shop, New Mexico (through 1977) *1983: Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah *1985: Eileen Kremen Gallery, Fullerton, California *1985: Eight Northern Artist and Craft Show, San Ildefonso Pueblo, New Mexico *1987: Kornbluth Gallery, Fair Lawn, New York *1988: anii ánáádaalyaa'íí: Continuity and Innovation in Recent Navajo Art, Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian, Santa Fe, New Mexico *1989: Navajo Pottery, Southwest Museum, Los Angeles, California *1989: Scripps 45th Ceramics Annual, Lang Art Gallery, Scripps College, Claremont, California *1989: From this Earth: Pottery of the Southwest, Museum of Indian Arts and Culture, Museum of New Mexico, Santa Fe *1990: The Cutting Edge, traveling exhibit organized by the Museum of American Folk Art, New York; Venues: New Britain Museum of American Art, New Britain, Connecticut; Laguna Art Museum, Laguna Beach, California; Telfair Museum, Savannah, Georgia; Tampa Museum of Art, Tampa, Florida; Whatcom Museum, Bellingham, Washington *1994: Honoring the Legacy, Museum of Northern Arizona, Flagstaff *1994: Diversity of Expression: New Mexico Folk Art, New Mexico State Capitol/Governor's Gallery, Santa Fe *1994: Contemporary Art of the Navajo Nation, traveling exhibit organized by Cedar Rapids (Iowa) Museum of Art; Venues: Albuquerque Museum, Albuquerque, New Mexico; University Art Museum, State University of New York, Albany, New York; Museum of the Southwest, Midland, Texas *1996: Contemporary Women Artists of the West, 1946-1996, Karan Ruhlen Gallery, Santa Fe, New Mexico *2019: Hearts of Our People: Native Women Artists, Minneapolis Institute of Art, Minneapolis, MN  Collection  * Denver Museum of Natural History, Colorado * Museum of Indian Arts & Culture, Museum of New Mexico, Santa Fe * Navajo Nation Museum, Window Rock, Arizona * School of American Research, New Mexico.

He notably participated in the Philippine–American War and World War I.  Early life and education  Dashiell was born Mecklenburg County, Virginia on 3 April 1863. He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1888, where he was a classmate of Peyton C. March. Dashiell later graduated from the Army School of the Line (1909) and the Army War College (1915).  Military career  After graduation, Dashiell was commissioned Second Lieutenant with the 8th Infantry Regiment at Fort D. A. Russell in Wyoming. He took part in conflicts with American Indians, including the Sioux Campaign of 1890–1891 and while posted in Arizona and Utah 1896–1899. In the interlude between 1892–1895, Dashiell was also a professor of Military Science and Tactics at the then North Georgia Agricultural College. During the Spanish–American War, although Dashiell's regiment was in Cuba, he himself was posted as commander of Fort Douglas in Utah. In 1899, Dashiell took part in the Philippine–American War, as commander of Company C in the 24th Infantry under the ill-fated General Henry Lawton. Dashiell returned to the Philippines again for a second tour of duty from 1906–1908, during which he was briefly commander of Camp Downes on the island of Leyte and then commander of the island's Third District during a Pulahan uprising. After returning from the Philippines, Dashiell was commander of the Madison Barracks in New York during 1908 and then commandant at Virginia Polytechnic Institute from 1909–1911. Dashiell was then stationed at various U.S. military installations from 1911–1917, including Fort Sheridan in Illinois, Fort Shafter in Hawaii and Fort Douglas in Utah. Upon the U.S. entry into World War I, Dashiell was promoted to Brigadier General of the National Army on 12 April 1918 and arrived in France in July. There he commanded the 11th Infantry Brigade of the 6th Infantry Division, supporting the 1st Army during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. Dashiell remained in France until 1919 and received a Silver Star for his service. After leaving France, Dashiell returned to Hawaii and was stationed for some time at Schofield Barracks. From 1925–1932, he taught at various schools in the state of Georgia, including in Atlanta and Fulton County.  Awards  * Silver Star  Personal life and death  Dashiell was married to Ida L.

Using pulsed EPR it is possible to measure electron spin relaxation, which can help uncover the dynamics of molecules. examined the frequency dependence of electron spin relaxation in fluid solution for several important types of radicals. She has studied the mechanisms of spin and spin-lattice relaxation in rigid lattices and fluid solutions; identifying the role of methyl groups and nuclear spins in spin echo dephasing. Her systematic studies in both glassy solvents and fluid solutions can be used to establish the relationship between structure and relaxation. Eaton developed spectral-spatial imaging using EPR, as well as the analysis software to accompany it. She wrote \\"EPR Imaging and in Vivo EPR\\" in 1991. Eaton has published several books about electron paramagnetic resonance and how to quantitatively produce the same results between labs. In 1998, Eaton published Foundations of Modern EPR. Distance measurents in Biological Systems by EPR was published in 2000. She published Biomedical EPR - Part A: Free Radicals, Metals, Medicine and Physiology and Part B: Methodology, Instrumentation, and Dynamics in 2004. In 2010 she published Quantitative EPR. In 2016 she collaborated with a biotechnology company to develop commercial imaging equipment. She demonstrated a way to measure oxygen in the body in realtime, which can provide similar information to MRI. At the Knoebel Institute for Healthy Aging they are developing these techniques to monitor disease therapies in situ. She has been principal investigator on several large NSF grants. She and her husband Gareth Eaton have a book fund at Harvard Library for chemistry students. She was appointed a Fellow of the Electron Paramagnetic Society in 2008. She has published extensively in peer-reviewed journals, has a H-index of over 50 and an I10-index of 239.

History  During the reign of the Greek Military Junta, the height limit for buildings was abolished, thus giving room for much taller buildings to be built. So in 1973, Apollo Tower was able to be built. Thanks to having been built with generators, during a powerful earthquake of 1981 that happened in Athens, Apollo Tower was one of the only buildings that stayed intact and even had power. The same happened during the deadly 1999 earthquake. The Building back then had a bar on the rooftop with a pool. Today the bar is closed and the pool is empty. Also, Today many of the apartments made for living are now used as offices and clinics. In fact, residents often joke about having a domiciliary hospital.

History In 1855, Southwestern Publishing House was established in Nashville, Tennessee. The company's name was chosen because, at that time, Nashville was in the southwestern part of the United States. Founded by the Baptist minister James Robinson Graves, Southwestern originally published The Tennessee Baptist, a Southern Baptist newspaper, and religious booklets which were sold by mail for 20¢ and 30¢ each. Prior to the Civil War, most bibles were printed in the North, rather than the South. Graves acquired stereotype plates from the North and began printing bibles for sale in August 1861. He also produced and sold educational books. After the 1864 Battle of Nashville resulted in a Union victory, Graves relocated to Memphis, as he felt vulnerable because of articles he had published against the North. The company resumed publishing in 1867.E. Michael Fleenor, \\"The Southwestern Company ,\\" Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2009. Retrieved: 12 February 2013. In 1868, Graves discontinued the company’s mail order business, and began training young men as independent dealers to sell bibles and educational books door-to-door as a way to earn money for college. Graves retired in 1871. In 1879 the company relocated to Nashville under the new ownership of Jacob Florida. In 1899, P. B. Jones, acquired majority ownership and became President and General Manager. In 1921, J. B. Henderson, a sixteen-year veteran who started in the summer sales program, became the sole owner. During the 1920s, the firm grew to one of the largest person-to-person sales companies in America. By 1947, Southwestern had lost nearly all of its independent dealers as a result of World War II. It was rebuilt ,and experienced tremendous growth as the United States rebounded from the Great Depression. The number of independent reps grew to over 1,500. In 1959 Oldham, a 24-year veteran who started in the summer sales program, became the majority shareholder of Southwestern; his ownership role that would last until 1968 and his presidential role that would last until 1972. J. Fred Landers was also made 49% owner at this time and continued his career with Southwestern until his death in 1987. The Southwestern Family of Companies headquarters is named after Fred for his deep contributions to the culture of the company. Dedicated by Spencer Hays in 1989. In 1968, Times-Mirror Company acquired ownership of Southwestern. In 1972, Spencer Hays, a fourteen-year veteran who started in the summer sales program, became president. In 1975, Times-Mirror formed a fund-raising company called Nashville Educational Marketing Services under Southwestern, later to be renamed Great American Opportunities. Jerry Heffel became the company's president in 1980. In 1982, executives of the firm purchased Southwestern and sister-company Great American Opportunities by leveraged buyout from Times-Mirror, forming Southwestern/Great American, Inc. Hays was named executive chairman of the board and Ralph Mosley was named chairman and CEO. Southwestern earned position 4,832 on the Inc. 5000 list in 2012 of the fastest growing private companies in the United States. Subsidiaries After the leveraged buyout in 1982 from Times-Mirror that formed Southwestern/Great American, Inc., the family of companies continued to expand.

In 2012, the firm acquired the assets of QSP, making it the largest school fundraising company in North America. In January 2019 Great American Opportunities realized it was bleeding, losing millions of dollars over Q4 of 2018. Henry Bedford and Dustin Hillis “restructured” the company selling off all products and distribution channels, firing entire salesforce, immediately ceasing all benefits and pay and only offering the donation platform and magazine line to the new 1099 based salesforce that remained. This is now called “Southwestern Fundraising” Southwestern Publishing Group was acquired as Favorite Recipes Press in 1982 from Fuller and Dees as a custom book publisher focused on cookbooks to be sold for fundraising purposes Since that time, over 1,500 titles have been published.

Governance structure The investment management team consists of 12 undergraduate students chosen through an interview and presentation process designed to simulate the hiring process of investment banking firms. The team consists of 2 portfolio managers and 10 equity analysts each dedicated to a specific industry sector: consumer products (discretionary), consumer products (staples), energy, financial services, healthcare, industrials, information technology, materials, telecommunications, and utilities. Each sector analyst pitches approximately 4 stocks per year, and must persuade all 12 members (not just a majority) of the investment team to buy. The student investment management team uses Bloomberg Professional Services running on Bloomberg Terminals to conduct in-depth financial analysis, manage the asset portfolio, and execute security trades. The students are unpaid, and do not share in the fund gains nor receive distributions. Investment strategy The long-term performance goal of the Lemma Senbet Fund is to outpace appreciation of the S&P; 500 Index on a risk- adjusted basis. Historically, the fund has adopted a top-down investment approach that is driven by Economic indicators, then Industry trends, and finally individual Company performance (EIC).

Biography  Much of what is known of Ellis Joseph's childhood and early adult years comes from three lengthy interviews that he gave to newspapers—the Barrier Miner in April 1910, the Sunday Times (Perth) in July 1912, and the Sun (Sydney) in September 1912. In the interview for The Barrier Miner in April 1910, Ellis Joseph said that he was born in Bombay (now Mumbai), India to Welsh parents of Jewish religion. Joseph is a Jewish surname—although not exclusively so and, amongst others, it is a Welsh name—and he was recognised as being Jewish in the U.S.A. Despite Joseph's own statement on his Welsh ethnicity, it is very likely that he actually was of Indian-Jewish origin but hid that Indian origin due to the then prevailing racial policies in Australia. Evidence supporting this is that his surname 'Joseph' was common in some Indian communities (particularly the Baghdadi Sephardic Jewish community but also the Syriac Christians), he was born at Bombay in India (a city with a significant Jewish population), he was described as having \\"dark-tanned skin\\" and his physical appearance in newspaper photographs. By the time that Ellis Joseph was born, many Baghdadi Jews were engaged in colonial commerce, were western-educated, and used English first names or English variants of Jewish first names. 'Ellis' may have been an anglicized version of Elias / Elijah, derived from the Hebrew name Eliyahu. Ellis Joseph said that the family moved to San Francisco in the United States when he was nine months old. In 1912, he said that he had lived near Van Ness Avenue and attended the Geary-street Public School. An obituary - published in the U.S.A. after his death in 1938 - stated that he was educated at an English school in Shanghai. Joseph gave this account of how he left home in the 1912 newspaper interview. alt= This 1912 account is similar to an earlier one given in 1910. In adulthood, Ellis Joseph was a physically large man—six feet six inches (1.98m) tall and 21 stone (294 lb or 134 kg) in weight—who was renowned for his seemingly boundless energy. For most of his adult life, he made his living by the import, export and sale of living creatures, capturing many of them himself on expeditions. There is no doubt of his genuine enthusiasm for wildlife of all kinds. In an interview he stated, reportedly with a sigh, \\"If I were a wealthy man, I'd have people collecting animals, for my zoo, instead of me collecting for other people's zoos.\\" He had a real gift for relating to and training animals but he was unsentimental about selling even pet animals, and he made large sums of money by trading in wildlife. By the standards of today, his methods of capturing and handling of living creatures would be seen as causing unacceptable suffering, too high an environmental impact, and an excessive death rate. From some time prior to 1901 up to 1923, he lived in Australia, when not travelling which he frequently did. His travel during these years took him to North America, South America, India, West Africa, and South Africa. From November 1918 to 1926, Joseph owned a 17-acre estate called 'Highfield Hall', which was located in what was then part of Granville but is now within the suburb of Guildford in Sydney. 'Highfield Hall' became both a private zoo and a temporary home for animals in transit to or from other countries. No mention has been found of Joseph ever marrying. He returned to the United States in 1923. He suffered bad health in his final years and died on 16 September 1938, of a heart attack aged 66 years old, at his home at 179 Mosholu Parkway, the Bronx.  Wildlife trading  = Early years = At the age of 13, Joseph discovered that there was money to be made in trading birds. While on a holiday trip with his father to Panama, he bought some green parrots at Central American ports and sold these at a profit when he returned to San Francisco. He left home at 15 and made his living trapping and selling birds on the US West Coast, also making a trip to Corinto, in Nicaragua to obtain birds. After a brief interlude during which he was returned to his home and to school, he once again left home at 17 years of age and traded—by his own account—birds from Mexico to Seattle and Tacoma. It seems that it was trading in birds from the Americas that brought him to Australia but, during an interview in 1910, he said that he also had held other jobs during those early years, including as a fireman in Melbourne (1901) and a railway yard foreman in Auckland, New Zealand. Once familiar with his new environment, he began exporting Australian birds to Europe. By 1904, Ellis Joseph appears to have based himself in the Western Australian Goldfields Region. In December 1904, he was in Boulder near Kalgoorlie in Western Australia selling caged birds, when one cage containing two 'Californian parakeets' was stolen from him. In September 1906, 'Ellis Josephs' was operating 'a newly-opened bird shop' in Maritana Street Kalgoorlie, was charged with 'cruelly treating a large number of birds by over-crowding them into cages', and fined £1 with 2s costs. In his defence, he stated that the birds had been shipped from Durban in the same cages, and had been inspected upon arrival in port by the 'Chief Stock Inspector and the manager of the Zoological Gardens'. The experience with the law may have influenced Ellis Joseph to leave Western Australia. In an advertisement for his Kalgoorlie bird shop on 14 September 1906, he announced that \\"I am leaving for the Eastern States\\" (of Australia). Hundreds of birds and other items were sold at auction in Perth on 25 September 1906 in preparation for his move. It is likely that, while in Western Australia, Ellis Joseph had made the acquaintance of Ernest Albert Le Souef (first director of the Perth Zoo from 1898 to 1935). He then began making larger scale expeditions and trading in larger animals. = Early expeditions to capture wildlife = Ellis Joseph's first venture into the 'big game' animal market was in India, as he stated in a lengthy interview as reported by the Barrier Miner newspaper in April 1910, \\"I embarked on the British India liner Mombassa at London for East India, and landed at Bombay. From there I travelled on to Poona, and thence onward to Surat. On arrival at Surat I bought two tigers, and caught two leopards, three spotted deer, and a large number of birds, including vultures. These I took to Europe, and eventually disposed of the lot at Marseilles.\\" By 1908, his attention turned to Africa, and he stated in the Barrier Miner interview that he had worked there alongside a big game hunter of the time. \\"My next journey was to Africa. I landed at Durban, and went to Bulawayo in company with a man named Van Ruyen, who at the present time is the greatest hunter in Africa, next to Sleus, the man who accompanied ex-president Roosevelt on his hunting tour. At Bulawayo we captured four lions, a number of elands, antelopes, water and spring bocks, sable antetopes, crown cranes, secretary birds, and a large number of other species. These were also taken to Europe, and I disposed of the lot to Carl Hagenback [sic], the great Hamburg animal trainer and dealer.\\" Joseph's companion on this expedition—the hunter reported as 'Van Ruyen'—almost certainly, was Cornelis van Rooyen, big game hunter and first breeder of the Rhodesian Ridgeback (previously known as 'Van Rooyen's lion dog'). The hunter reported as 'Sleus' is almost certainly the famous big game hunter Frederick Courteney Selous, who was a friend of Cornelis van Rooyen, and who accompanied Theodore Roosevelt on the Smithsonian–Roosevelt African Expedition in 1909. In April 1908, about 80-miles away from Bulawayo, Joseph was injured on the forearm by a lioness that he had captured during this expedition. Ellis Joseph's Chimpanzees - Photograph from Sun (Sydney), 30 Sept 1912. In May 1909, Ellis Joseph was in Brisbane exhibiting two chimpanzees that had been trained to perform tricks, and when he gave his long interview to the Barrier Miner in April 1910, was at Broken Hill with just one trained chipanzee called 'Casey'. The second chimpanzee 'Baldy' had died in Queensland in May 1909 and its body had been sold by Joseph to a Brisbane museum for use as an exhibit. In May 1910, 'Casey' was performing tricks in Adelaide, in August of the same year in Kalgoorlie, and in November in Hobart. It seems that, between his 1908 and 1911-1912 expeditions outside Australia, he made a living exhibiting the chimpanzees while travelling in Australia and, very likely, capturing or buying Australian animals and birds for export as he went along. In a newspaper interview, in May 1910, he explained that, before he could obtain two hippos for Melbourne Zoo, he would need to sell 'Casey' his trained chimpanzee, which he apparently did to a Mr. Thomas Fox. ('Casey' escaped in December 1914 and was shot in the foot by police in Marrickville, Sydney, after allegedly frightening a woman to death. Mr. Fox lost an eye in the same incident and, after being fined £2 and paying £300 in compensation to the dead woman's estate, he took 'Casey' to the U.S.A. Casey died at Tampa, Florida in January 1917.) During the long interview of April 1910, Ellis Joseph stated that he had supplied animals to the Adelaide, Melbourne. Perth, and Sydney Zoos, zoos in Europe and America, and the Pretoria Zoo in South Africa. He also stated that he had made an expedition to Argentina to capture wildlife including pumas, as well as several expeditions to Africa. By late 1911, he was making another expedition to West Africa to collect specimens, some of which he sold to the Perth Zoo upon his return in 1912, and was shipping significant numbers of birds and animals. Once the connection with zoos had been made, Joseph had customers ready to take creatures he captured and his reputation as a major dealer in wildlife grew. The outbreak of World War I and Germany's subsequent loss of her overseas colonies, together with the death of Carl Hargenbeck in 1913, created an opportunity for Joseph, as Germany's hitherto dominant position in the trading of animals for zoos became vacant. By 1913, Eliis Joseph was in Sydney and had a 'vivariaum' at Moore Park, the location of the Zoological Gardens at that time. In that year, he met Harry Burrell and began to take a keen interest in Burrell's attempts to exhibit platypuses at zoos. = Capturing larger animals = Joseph was interested mainly in capturing live animals for profit, not in hunting big game or collecting dead specimens for museums. But in trying to capture young animals alive, the deaths of older wild animals and animals used as bait did occur. Captured animals also often died; getting the captured animals to eat was seen by Joseph as a major challenge. In the April 1910 interview, he outlined the problem with larger animals such as chimpanzees, as follows. \\"The next thing is to get them to eat after they are placed in captivity. You certainly, do succeed at times, but in most cases the animals sulk or die. The same trouble is experienced with the gorilla, a full size specimen of which has not been possible to rear. Even after years of captivity the gorilla becomes savage, sulks, and dies.\\" In the April 1910 interview, he described three of the methods he used to capture African animals. \\"The best and most effective method I have found to be is the building of a trap, something like a large room, with a picket partition. This would have a door in the front, which would be self-acting, and close down by means of a spring, being released by the weight and vibration caused by the rustling movement of the beast. In this cage or room would be placed a donkey, which is used as a bait. Lions are fond of donkey flesh, and prefer it to the flesh of horses or bullocks.\\" \\"The best time to catch the hippopotamus is on moonlight nights and in the dry season. As is well known, the hippo, is an amphibious animal, and when the moon is clear and bright it comes out of the creeks to graze. The hunter has then to discover the favorite spot or breeding places of the beast, and, having done that, build a barricade there. The next move is to get at a point about a mile away, and erect another barricade, and the hippo is thus enclosed in a kind of pound. The express rifle is next brought into use to shoot the old hippos, and the securing of the young animals is then a comparatively easy matter. The full-grown ones are too ferocious and too weighty to handle, weighing from two to four tons each.\\" \\"Where the casava grows is to be found a creeper called by the natives ti-ti. The stem of this creeper is about the thickness of an ordinary penholder with the strength and pliabilty of wire. Of this creeper the chimpanzee takes no notice, and thus an almost natural trap is made for him. The natives plait the stems of the ti-ti and make snares. Having completed the snares, 'boys' are placed a few hundred yards away with nets and lassoos. In due time the 'chimp.' comes along and digs for the [casava] root. lt gets caught in the snare, and begins to make a noise. Action has to be at once taken to secure the animal, otherwise it will either liberate itself or its fellow 'chimps.' will do so. The lassoo, which is a double-ended one, is thrown, the chimpanzee is caught in the centre of it, and eventually it is placed safely in a box waiting for its reception, where it is freed.\\" In an interview with The Sun (Sydney) in September 1912, he disclosed a fourth method. \\"In many cases a favorite watering place of the animals was charged with bromide or cyanide of potassium, which had the effect of stupefying the beasts. Then, of course, they were easy to handle and stored away.\\" By the standards of today, these methods cause unacceptable suffering, too high an environmental impact, and an excessive death rate. = Association with Le Souef family and zoos = Joseph formed an association with three Australian zoo directors, the brothers Ernest Albert Le Souef (first director of the Perth Zoo from 1898 to 1935), Albert Sherbourne Le Souef (secretary of the Zoological Gardens at Moore Park, Sydney, up to 1916 and then first director of Taronga Park Zoo, from 1916 to 1939) and William Henry Dudley Le Souef (an ornithologist and second director of Melbourne Zoo from 1902 to 1923). Their father was Albert Alexander Cochrane Le Souef, who until his death in 1902 was—like his sons—a zoologist and was involved in the establishment of the Perth Zoo and the Melbourne Zoo, of which he was its first director. Some saw Ellis Joseph's association with the Le Souef family and the Australian zoos as both unduly advantaging Ellis Joseph over other exporters of Australian wildlife and allowing the zoos themselves to profit, from a large-scale export of Australian animals and birds, against the intent of statutes governing such exports. Leading the demands for greater transparency were the Daily Telegraph (Sydney) and the Wild Life Preservation Society. In 1922, as a result of their efforts, it became known publicly that Ellis Joseph had earlier entered into an exclusive arrangement for a period of five-years, under which he was to receive a half-share of profits from sales (net of transport and other costs) but was guaranteed a minimum of £1000 per annum. Around this time, Ellis Joseph had a falling out with the Le Soueth brothers, losing access to their influence. = Deliveries to Australian zoos = The scale of Ellis Joseph's operations is apparent from the large shipments he made to Australia during the period from 1912 to 1921. Some of the animals were sold to Australian zoos and some—after November 1918—would be kept at Joseph's estate \\"Highfield Hall\\" unless sold or while awaiting trans- shipment to zoos in the U.S.A or other countries. Ellis Joseph with king penguin (from Western Mail (Perth), 3 August 1912)  1912 shipment  By November 1911, Eliis Joseph was in West Africa. He advised from Sierra Leone that he was going to leave 'Koko Beach' in the south of Nigeria in search of more animals, having already captured some at that time. Ellis Joseph arrived in Perth on 22 June 1912 with a collection of animals mainly from West Africa. He had failed to obtain rhinocerous for the Perth Zoo. He described what he had found as follows: What was reported as a 'mermaid' was an African manatee that later died while being transported to England. Several of the animals in this 1912 shipment were purchased by Perth Zoo. Ellis Joseph was selling grey parrots from the 1912 shipment to the public, advertising in Perth and Kalgoorlie. In 1913, he was exporting birds to Vancouver.  1914 shipments  In March 1914, Ellis Joseph brought a cargo of animals to Sydney on the RMS Niagara from Vancouver, Canada. The shipment was reported as follows \\"Bulking largest are two magnificent bull bison, captured in Montana; and next in size are two elk, the latter pair and some of the other animals being for the Sydney Zoological Gardens.\\" \\"The other inhabitants of this floating menagerie ...... are 14 bears black, brown, and cinnamon - several deer, eight peccary (Mexican wild boar), flve coyotes (prairie wolves), three beavers, several minx, a number of squirrels, raccoons, porcupines, lynx, four badgers, and a leopard cat. Among the birds are four American baldheaded eagles, Canadian \\"honker\\" goose, blue jays, snow birds, and variegated thrushes. There are also a number of snakes. The whole collection is native of either the States or Canada, and took over four months to got together. They are destined for various Zoological Gardens.\\" In March 1914, Joseph sold one of the bull bison and some of the other animals to the Adelaide Zoo. The bison had been in a crate, in which it could not turn, for four months and so had marks on its skin. In late December 1914, Ellis Joseph had another cargo of animals on board ss Nordic en route from Durban to the eastern states of Australia. There was a rhinoceros on board and Ellis stated that this was only the fourth one to be captured alive, There were also two African elephants and many other animals on board. The inventory was described as follows. \\"a brown hyena, two lions, four leopards, two zebras, two South American llamas, Moufflons, Barbary sheep, blesbok, springbok, ducker bok, impalla, and sable antelopes, jackals, lemurs, two South African elephants, a Livingstone eland, Patagonian hares, a rhinoceros, 40 apes and baboons of different kinds, an Aldebarra tortoise from the Seychelles Islands, pythons and birds of all descriptions.\\" Some of these animals were destined for the Melbourne Zoo. In August 1915, Ellis Joseph assisted a fundraising day in Sydney by providing the use of one of the African elephants, a four to five year old 'baby' elephant called 'African Daisy'. Joseph said that he had captured the elephant in Southern Rhodesia in October 1914 and had trained it for a fortnight for the fundraising activity. During the fundraising, the baby elephant was ridden by a little girl. It was reported that the zoos in Australia could not pay him enough for this 'baby' elephant and Joseph sent it to Honolulu.  1916 shipment  In 1916, Eliis Joseph brought three young polar bears—one male and two female—from New York for the Taronga Park Zoo in Sydney. The cost was £450. By 1919, the zoo was planning to attempt to breed bear cubs from these bears. The content of the shipment was reported as follows. \\"The most interesting animal of the consignment is a monster grizzly bear, which was captured after a hard fight in his Rocky Mountain home. This animal is destined for the new bear pit at Taronga Park. The other animals include three polar bears, two grizzly bears, a todiac [sic] bear, two Mongolian wild horses, monkeys, beavers, raccoons, 14 elks, and black and cinnamon bears. There are also a number of parrots, buzzards, Virginian wild turkeys; white cross pigeons, alligators, and various varieties of snakes.\\" One of the snakes was a boa-constrictor. Two elks and a bison died during the voyage. Ellis Joseph hoped to dispose of the wildlife to the Taronga Park Zoo in Sydney and to the Adelaide Zoo.  1921 shipment  In 1921, Ellis Joseph was a passenger on the first part of the last voyage of the SS Canastota. After the ship left New York and passed through the Panama Canal, it called first at Suva, Fiji, where numerous birds, animals and reptiles were transferred to the A.U.S.N. Co. steamer Levuka (bound for Sydney), along with Mr Joseph. The transfer between ships was made so as to reduce the time it would take to deliver the live cargo to Sydney. The wildlife in the shipment were as follows. \\"8 bears (polar and grizzly), 3 buffaloes, 14 racoons, 2 wolves, 8 foxes, 50 monkeys,. 2 mountain lions, 5 skunks, 100 snakes, 100 parrots, 100 finches, 2 llamas, 20 white swans, 7 possums, 40 alligators, 21 tortoises,.2 gilla monsters, 1 woolley monkey\\". A hyena and a llama died during the voyage. On 18 April 1921, Mr. Joseph and his menagerie reached Sydney safely. The cargo of creatures was divided between Taronga Park Zoo in Sydney and Melbourne Zoo. On Anzac Day (25 April) 1921, he was reunited - in front of a hundred or so onlookers - with his former pet chipmazee 'Casey', whom he had sold to the Taronga Park Zoo before leaving for America in 1920. (This chimpanzee was the second 'Casey', not the one with whom he had travelled Australia in 1909-1910.) In Casey's excitement to see him again—or so it was reported at the time—'Casey' embraced Joseph but, in doing so, delivered a bite to Joseph's jaw that resulted in a large wound to his cheek and another below his chin. Joseph, who had one arm in a sling at the time, was rescued by a zoo keeper and sent to hospital for treatment. The second 'Casey' lived at the zoo, until his death in January 1936. = Deliveries to American zoos =  1916 & 1917 shipments (thylacine or 'Tasmanian tiger', elephant & 'Hawaiian wallabies')  Thylacines at Hobart Zoo - 1911, 1928 and 1933 (compilation of silent films). Joseph played a small part in hastening the extinction of the thylacine or 'Tasmanian tiger', by providing two of the animals to the Bronx Zoo, in New York in 1916 and 1917. The first animal died after only seven days at the zoo, while the second lived until September 1919. On a visit to the Bronx Zoo, the director of the Melbourne Zoo, Mr. Le Souef, said upon seeing the last animal, \\"I advise you to take excellent care of that specimen; for when it is gone, you never will get another. The species soon will be extinct\\". The last known thylacine died at the Beaumaris Zoo in Hobart in 1936. In 1916, Joseph delivered a young African elephant to Honolulu's Kapiolani Park Zoo. Named 'Miss Daisy' - almost certainly the same elephant as 'African Daisy' who was used for fundraising in Sydney in 1915. She was at the zoo until March 1933, when she went on a rampage. She killed her keeper George Conradt, got loose, and was then shot dead. Two brush-tailed rock wallabies sold in 1916 by Ellis Joseph to a developer, for his private zoo, are believed to be the ancestors of the wild population of wallabies in the Kalihi Valley on the Hawaiian island of O'ahu.  1920 shipment  Using his estate 'Highfield Hall' to accommodate the creatures, Joseph accumulated a consignment of over 4,000 Australian birds, animals and reptiles for the New York Zoo. This live cargo was shipped from Sydney on the steamer Bellbuckle, which arrived in New York on 29 October 1920. Mr. Joseph accompanied his live cargo as a passenger. (Prior to leaving Sydney, in August 1920, he sold his pet chimpanzee—the second one that he owned called 'Casey'—to the Taronga Park Zoo.) The shipment included a lung-fish, from the Burnett River in Queensland, for the New York Zoo. This was unusual for Ellis Joseph, who was interested in all animals but did \\"not deal in fishes, except on his breakfast plate\\". Some of the creatures were sent to the US under an agreement between American zoos and Australian zoos, to cooperate by providing specimens endemic to each country, and some belonged to Mr. Joseph himself. The exact role of Ellis Joseph was controversial; he appeared to be both a wildlife dealer and simultaneously acting as an 'agent' for the Australian zoos. While in New York, Mr. Joseph assembled a shipment of creatures destined for Australian zoos. He left New York, together with his new live cargo, aboard the ss Canastota on 6 March 1921.  Koala or 'koala bear'  Speaking in April 1921, about Ellis Joseph, the master of the ss Canastota (Captain Andrew J. Lockie) said in a newspaper interview.:  Platypus (1922)  Platypus With the assistance of the Australian naturalist and expert on monotremes, Henry Burrell, Ellis Joseph took the first live platypus to be seen outside Australia to the United States in 1922. Five platypuses were shipped from Sydney on 12 May 1922 to San Francisco, from where they were sent by train to New York, at all times accompanied by Mr. Joseph. Ellis Joseph had been assisted by his local member of the NSW Parliament, Mr A.K. Bowden MLA, to obtain an export permit for the platypuses.Henry Burrell with his 'portable platypusary'.The animals were transported in an enclosure designed by Burrell—with some input from Joseph—that was known as a 'portable platypusary'. It consisted of five compartments leading from the water to the sand, and in each of the internal walls there was a narrow, rubber-lined doorway. Joseph explained the secret of the 'portable platypusary', in an interview: Despite the special enclosure and the great care taken, after the long journey of over fifty days, only one platypus was alive and it survived at the New York Zoological Park for only seven weeks. Ellis Joseph wrote about the events of the long journey and his efforts—from 1916 onwards—to export a platypus, in an article for Bulletin of the New York Zoological Society that was quoted in The Journal (Adelaide) of 7 April 1923. The export of a live platypus was the pinnacle of Joseph's career and he was proud to have achieved it. It remained the event for which he was most renowned, for several decades.  1923 shipments (camels, birds and kangaroos)  In July 1923, Ellis Joseph made a large shipment to the United States using two separate ships. He bought 55 camels, from a camel depot of the government of South Australia and shipped these to America on the steamer Eastern. (or Easterner). The camels were destined for American zoos. Camels are not native to Australia but were imported as a means of transport in arid areas. By the time of the shipment, such camels were being replaced by motorised transport. Camels still exist in Australia, in large numbers, as feral animals. Ellis Joseph also sent a shipment of birds and 150 kangaroos to New York on the steamer Medic. He had been advertising to purchase live kangaroos in June 1923.  1924 shipment  In September 1924, Ellis Joseph imported several elephants on board the SS American Trader, which were unloaded at Hoboken. = End of Australian operations =  Opposition to wildlife exports and regulatory changes  In 1923, although still exporting Australian animals in that year, Ellis Joseph was not allowed to reattempt the export of live platypuses to the United States. Influencing that decision was the fact that three playpuses destined for export had died while in captivity in Australia. After having spent much time and effort since 1916 pursuing this aim, it must have been a great disappointment. Public and expert opinion was changing in favour of animal welfare and conservation of wildlife in its natural environment, and it is likely that Joseph's reputation had suffered some damage due to the revelations about his contractual arrangements in 1922. He had also had a falling out with the Le Soueth brothers, losing access to their influence. Changing attitudes and a growing conservation movement led to increased regulation of the wildlife trade in Australia. In 1923, almost at the same time as Joseph's 1923 shipment to the United States, a prohibition was placed by the Minister of Customs on the export certain species from Australia. From that time on, export of such wildlife would be guided by recommendations to the Collector of Customs by an advisory committee in each state of Australia but no export permit would be granted for 'purely commercial reasons'. For a commercial dealer in rare and exotic animals such as Joseph, the consequences of the new Australian regulatory arrangements were enormous; it effectively would end his ability to export many Australian animals and birds. Joseph's 1923 shipment included only wildlife that he claimed had been captured prior to the prohibition, that he claimed he had purchased from 'public gardens'—presumably zoos—or from private owners. It seems that Ellis Joseph's Australian-based wildlife import and export operations ceased after 1923.  Sale of Highfield Hall  Ellis Joseph's 17.75 acre estate 'Highfield Hall', with its 12-room house and offices, had been his home since November 1918. Its extensive grounds housed his personal menagerie and were used as a holding location for animals prior to their shipment and sale. Highfield Hall probably had a small farm, and it had been used, before it was owned by Ellis Joseph, to run cattle and raise poultry. The estate probably was at least partially self-sufficient in providing food for the animals and birds Ellis Joseph kept there. In October 1925, an auction was held at 'Highfield Hall' for 'building materials' including a large quantity of hardwood timber, a 60-foot long shed, 170 bird cages, incubators, a brooder and a tip-dray with horse and harness, on the \\"instructions from Mrs. Moore, who is acting for Mr. Joseph\\". Mrs Moore was Hannah Moore, who like her husband Arthur Moore was an animal keeper. The pair had looked after the estate during Ellis Joseph's absence. Ellis Joseph's house and estate, its luxurious furnishings, his possessions - including a \\"Magnificent collection of valuable Skins\\" - and his motor car - a 1920 Buick - were put to a second auction on 5 December 1925, \\"under instructions from and for and on account of Mrs. H.J. Moore, in consequence of her early departure for abroad.\\" The inventory of the auction, which was advertised as \\"The sale of the season\\", indicates that Ellis Joseph was by that time a very wealthy man. By 1926, 'Highfield Hall' had been sold for £6,500, Joseph having been based in the United States from 1923.  Legacy in Australia  Ellis Joseph & Mike (Daily Telegraph (Sydney) 4-Oct-1927) Ellis Joseph's main legacy was the extensive animal collections at the Perth, Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide zoos. A newspaper photograph in the Daily Telegraph of 4 October 1927, suggests that he made a visit to Sydney in that year. The caption read \\"Kiss and be friends — Ellis Joseph, the animal dealer, \\"makes up\\" with his friend Mike the chimpanzee, after slight difference.\\" \\"Molly the orangutan\\", an animal who was said to have been captured by Ellis Joseph in Borneo, and who belonged to the same Mr Thomas Fox of Marrickville who had bought the first 'Casey', toured Australia into the early 1930s. By 1931, Ellis Joseph's Australian home \\"Highfield Hall\\" had become a boarding school. The land later was subdivided. Ellis Joseph was still well known in the 1930s, being remembered mainly as the man who had exported the first live playpus. After that, he faded from memory. = Later years in the US = After his return to the US, Ellis Joseph lived in New York from 1923 and, from 1927 until his death, in the Bronx, New York, in a neighbourhood not far from the Bronx Zoo.  Live animal trade  Ellis Joseph appears to have relocated at least some of his Australian menagerie from 'Highfield Hall' in Sydney (sold by 1926) to a location at Conner Street and Hollers Avenue in the Bronx, New York. In the 1920s, he was trading live animals in the United States. Between 1925 and 1928, he sold four elephants: two to circuses and two to zoos. He retired in 1933.  Museum gifts  The president of the American Museum of Natural History noted in his annual report for 1926, that Ellis Joseph had supplied (dead) specimens to the museum. \\"The New York Zoological Society and Mr. Ellis S. Joseph continued to supply the Department with important specimens for preservation in its study collections, which have been well used by specialists from the Yale, Johns Hopkins, and Columbia departments of anatomy and neuro-anatomy.\\" The same annual report included Ellis Stanley Joseph in the list of life members of the museum, and stated that he had provided \\"by Gift\\" the following specimens: For Mammalogy: \\"1 Anteater, giant; 2 baboons; 1 baboon, hamadrlyas; 1 eyra cat; 1 fishing cat; 3 gazelles; 1 addra gazelle; 1 Semmerring's gazelle; 1 hyaena; 1 spotted hyaena; 1 ibex; 1 leopard; 1 lynx caracal; 1 sheep \\". For Comparative Anatomy: \\"1 Anteater, giant (Myrmecophaga jubata), South America. 4 Baboons; 2 baboons, hamadryas, Africa; 2 hyeenas, Africa; 1 kangaroo, Australia; 1 llama, young; 1 macaque; 1 mandrill, Africa; 1 mangabey; 2 monkeys, green, Africa; 2 monkeys, green (Erythrocebbus), A f r i c a; 1 monkey, putty - nosed, West Africa; 1 ostrich; 1 pelican, Egyptian.\\" It is not clear whether these animals were killed to create museum specimens or had already died when gifted to the museum - in earlier years, Ellis Joseph had been known to sell or gift only animals of his that had died to museums - but the number of animals gifted, in just one year, suggests either the slaughtering of at least part of his personal menagerie occurred in 1926 or an exceptional death rate in that year. Ellis Joseph also gave gifts of specimens to the museum in 1928 and 1930  Death  For the last five years of his life, Ellis Joseph suffered poor health. Ellis Joseph died on 16 September 1938, of a heart attack aged 66 years old, at his home at 179 Mosholu Parkway, the Bronx. So ended an extraordinary and eventful life.

Early years and education Nathaniel White, the oldest child of Samuel and Sarah (Freeman) White, was born in Lancaster, New Hampshire, February 7, 1811. His ancestors were among the hardy pioneers who settled New England. William White, the founder of the family in the United States, came from England and landed at Ipswich, Massachusetts, in 1635. The descendants of William were among the earliest settlers of northern New Hampshire. His childhood was passed under his mother's care, and she provided strict religious training. Career At the age of fourteen, he went into the employ of a merchant of Lunenburg, Vermont, with whom he remained about one year, when he accepted employment with Gen. John Wilson, of Lancaster, who was just entering upon his duties as landlord of the Columbian Hotel in Concord, New Hampshire. His parents more readily consented to his taking this step on account of the many noble qualities of Mrs. Wilson. To her care he was entrusted by his own mother. In the employ of Gen. Wilson, White commenced life in Concord in an entry-level position. He arrived in Concord, August 25, 1826, with one shilling in his pocket. For five years, or until he came of age, he continued at the Columbian Hotel, rendering a strict account of his wages to his father, and saving the dimes and quarters which came as perquisites, until by his twenty-first birthday, he had a fund of . In 1832, he made his first business venture, negotiating the first and last business loan of his life, and purchased a part interest in the stage route between Concord and Hanover, New Hampshire, and occupying the \\"box\\" himself for a few years. In one year, he was free from debt. Soon after, he bought into the stage route between Concord and Lowell, Massachusetts. In 1838, in company with Capt. William Walker, he initiated the Pony Express business, making three trips weekly to Boston, and personally attending to the delivery of packages, goods, or money, and other business entrusted to him. In 1842, upon the opening of the Concord Railroad, he was one of the original partners of the express company which was then organized to deliver goods throughout New Hampshire and Canada. The company was successfully operated under various names, and it was indebted to White for its remarkable financial success. White residence, whose grounds were situated from School to Capitol streets (1894) In 1846, White purchased his farm, and cultivated it till his death. It lay in the southwestern section of the city, from the statehouse, and contained over of land. He evinced a strong attachment to Concord, and to him, the city owed much of her material prosperity. In 1852, he made his first step in political life, being chosen by the Whigs and Free-soilers to represent Concord in the New Hampshire state legislature. He was an abolitionist from the start; a member of the Anti-Slavery society from its inception. His hospitable home was the refuge of many a hunted slave, a veritable station on the under-ground railroad, where welcome, care, food, and money were freely bestowed. The attic of his house and the hay-mows of his stable were resting places for persecuted black men. In all works of charity and philanthropy, White was foremost or prominent. He was deeply interested in the establishment of the New Hampshire Asylum for the Insane and the State Reform School; in the Orphans' Home, at Franklin, New Hampshire, which he liberally endowed; and the Home for the Aged, in Concord, which was his special care. The Reform Club of Concord, though not an eleemosynary institution, received substantial benefits from his generosity. White Farm Besides his extensive interest in the express company, his farm, —which was one of the most highly cultivated in the state,— his charming summer retreat on the borders of Lake Sunapee, and his real estate in Concord, he was interested in real estate in Chicago, in hotel property in the mountain districts, in railroad corporations, in banks, in manufacturing establishments, and in shipping. He was a director in the Manchester & Lawrence, the Franconia & Profile House, and the Mount Washington railroads, and in the National State Capital Bank. He was a trustee of the Loan and Trust Savings Bank of Concord; also of the Reform School, Home for the Aged, and Orphans' Home, and other private and public trusts. In 1875, White was candidate for governor, of the Prohibition Party; and he had a vast number of friends in the Republican party, with which he was most closely identified, who wished to secure his nomination for the highest honor within the gift of a state, by the Republican party. In 1876, he was sent as a delegate to the Republican National Convention, which nominated Rutherford B. Hayes for president. During the summer of 1880, he was placed by his party at the head of the list of candidates for presidential electors. Personal life November 1, 1836, he married Armenia S., daughter of John Aldrich, of Boscawen, New Hampshire, who survived him. Their children were John A. White, Armenia E. White, wife of Horatio Hobbs, Lizzie H. White, Nathaniel White, Jr., and Benjamin C. White, who survive.

It is usually in diameter, has long trailing stems and upright, inverted lance-shaped, entire leaves but for one to five shallow reddish bony teeth near the tip. Its small flower heads of 1½–2 cm (0.6–0.8 in) in diameter, consist of four to seven drab carmine-colored flowers that strongly curve back to the centre of the head. It mainly flowers from July till November and is pollinated by mice. It has been given the common name Ruitersbos pincushion.  Description  Leucospermum hamatum is a crawling low shrub of no more than high that can form dense mats of in diameter, with stout branches of up to 2½ cm (1 in) thick that stretch out along ground and originate from a central stout trunk of up to 4½ cm (1.8 in) thick. The flowering branches are slim, trailing along the ground, frequently divided in two, about thick, with very few soft long hairs, mostly with one flower head at the tip of the branches and several in the axils of the furthest leaves. The leaves are alternately set, upright, narrowly oblong to oblong-elliptic, 4½–6½ cm (1.8–2.6 in) long and wide, set on a leaf stalk of up to ½ cm (0.2 in) long. Near the leaf tip are usually about three teeth, sometime the margin is wholly entire. The surface of the leaf is initially slightly powdery, but this is lost later on. The flower head is 1½–2 cm (0.6–0.8 in) in diameter and consists of four to seven flowers in one whorl set on a stalk of 1–2 cm (0.4–0.8 in) long. Three or four lance-shaped involucral bracts of long with a pointy or pointed tip subtend the flower head or are entirely absent. The bracteole that is subtending the individual flower is 1–1½ cm (0.4–0.6 in) long and wide, oval in circumference with a pointy tip, sharply folded at the midvein and embracing the foot of the perianth, with a slightly powdery surface and a row of fine hairs around the rim. The perianth is very strongly curved toward the center of the flower head, in long. In the lower part of the perianth, the four lobes are fused into a tube which is much inflated towards its end, up to ½ cm (0.2 in) in diameter, without hairs. The middle part that consists of the claws is wide near the base, narrow near the tip and strongly coiled at anthesis. The three perianth lobes facing toward the center of the flower head and sideways are incompletely fused and about long, the free lobe facing the rim of the flower head is long. The outer surface is hairless, but where the tube splits in four, the margins have a row of woolly hairs. The four anthers are directly attached to the 2 mm (0.08 in) long upper part of the perianth by a swollen fleshy connection. The style that is 1¾–2 cm (0.7–0.8 in) long is very strongly bent (about 180°) towards the center of the flower head, and nearer to its tip both tapers and is set with stiff hairs facing towards the base, changing to coarsely powdery further toward the base. It is topped by a slight thickening called pollen presenter, which has a cone- shape with a pointy tip, is about 2 mm (0.08 in) long, with a groove at the very end that acts as the stigma. The ovary of about 1 mm (0.04 in) long, gradually merges into the style, has a fine powdery surface. It is subtended by four nectar producing blunt line-shaped scales of about 2 mm (0.08 in) long. The fruit is a cylindric, greyish-white achene, with a fine powdery surface and a central indent at its base. The subtribe Proteinae, to which the genus Leucospermum has been assigned, consistently has a basic chromosome number of twelve (2n=24).  Taxonomy  L. hamatum was named and described by John Patrick Rourke in 1983. The species name hamatum is derived from the Latin word meaning \\"hooked\\" and refers to the barbs near the tip of the styles. L. hamatum is the type species of the section Hamatum.  Distribution, habitat and ecology  Leucospermum hamatum is only known from one location on the Klein Moeras River Farm, in the northern foothills of the Outeniqua Mountains, in the catchment area of the Moordkuils River. In August 1982, more than a thousand specimens were found here, in an area of several hectares, at approximately altitude. In areas where wildfire had recently raged, only seedlings were found. Position and inconspicuousness of the flower heads make it unlikely that it is pollinated by either birds or insects. It is assumed that small rodents pollinate the flowers however. A relatively large amount of nectar accumulates in the bladder-like perianth tubes.  Conservation  The Ruitersbos pincushion is considered endangered. Only five small subpopulations are known, spread over an area of about 20 km². It may be threatened by the invasive Hakea, which has been removed from the direct neighborhood of L. hamatum, but which may spread again if it is not managed.

It's a type of Rapid Attack Fortress opening, used mostly when playing Black (sente). It's often classified as a trap opening. It was created by professional shogi player Kōichi Kodama,児玉孝一『必殺！カニカニ銀: ―究極の二枚銀戦法』（1992年、日本将棋連盟、） for which he received the prestigious Kōzō Masuda Award in 2003. Overview Due to the large amount of freedom of the rook to enter into the game, finding ways to attack even in the middle of a Rapid Attack Fortress has quite the merit. Unlike the Double-Silver Rapid Attack Fortress, king and gold don't move at all from their initial position (Sitting king). In the fifth movement, rather than pushing P-66, the silver is pushed to S-77. Instead of opting not to push the rook pawn from Fortress, White (gote) will play S-33 following Black's rook pawn being pushed to P-25, which will be followed by ▲S-48, ▲P-56, ▲S-57, ▲S-46. After that, if White (gote) were to push the pawn in the 5th file, the rook will go to the center file with ▲R-58, and then, for example, ▲B-97, ▲S-66, ▲N-77, with the aim of breaking through the center.児玉孝一『必殺！カニカニ銀: ―究極の二枚銀戦法』（1992年、日本将棋連盟、） Although at first it was frequent for White (gote) to unthinkingly push the gold to △G-32, since it was difficult for Black (sente) to defend from a breakthrough from the center, making preparations beforehand by playing △G61-52 became more frequent. When aiming to attack from the center, pushing the pawn in the 3rd file with ▲P-36 allows the rival to attack the king on its weak points and also delays the attack, so it's often considered a bad move.児玉孝一『必殺！カニカニ銀: ―究極の二枚銀戦法』（1992年、日本将棋連盟、） See also * Fortress opening * Morishita System * Akutsu Rapid Attack Fortress * Waki System * Spearing the Sparrow * Fortress vs Right Fourth File Rook * Static Rook * Central Rook References Bibliography *児玉孝一『必殺！カニカニ銀: ―究極の二枚銀戦法』（1992年、日本将棋連盟、） (Koichi Kodama's 'Hissatsu!

It uses its gameplay as the basis for an all-encompassing collection of levels from every original Neversoft game in the series, for use in single-player and online multiplayer gameplay. The mod has been continuously updated since its initial beta release in 2013. The mod is free to download, but Underground 2 must be installed.  Background and development  According to developer Morten Larson in a 2018 interview with Vice, the idea for a mod such as THUG Pro had existed for a long time, but by 2012, felt it had become necessary; the community was struggling and fractured by that point, with the majority of the game's offline servers having since been shut down, and those still playing on servers still up spread across different platforms. The mod's first official beta release was on August 10, 2013. In its initial release, the mod featured all levels from Tony Hawk's Underground and its sequel Underground 2, as well as custom park themes from Pro Skater 4 and American Wasteland. Over time, more levels from the games were added; for instance, on December 13, 2015, the rest of the Pro Skater 3 levels were added. Versions for macOS and Linux, based on Wine, were posted in the THPS forums, but as of 2019 the download links for these versions are broken. The game can still be installed manually in Wine. THUGPro's original logo from its initial 2013 release In the same interview with Vice, Larson detailed long-term plans for the future of THUG Pro, including mod support, new levels, a \\"Create-A-Theme\\" mode, custom soundtracks, and a higher resolution visual overhaul. These features appeared in update 0.6.0.0, released in late June 2018.  Gameplay  THUG Pro, being a mod of Underground 2, has similar gameplay to that of the sixth generation-era entries in the Tony Hawk game series. The mod focuses on online multiplayer as its main game mode and there is no single-player campaign. Its only single- player mode is \\"Freeskate\\"/\\"High Score Run\\", which allows players to practice for online play. Online multiplayer consists of all traditional game types found in past Tony Hawk games. The game includes a majority of the levels from the Neversoft era of the franchise barring Tony Hawk's Proving Ground.  Features  Aside from it's inclusion of a majority of levels from throughout the Tony Hawk's series, THUG Pro also includes support of customized levels and soundtracks. Custom levels and skaters made by other users can be downloaded on the THPSX website. A Blender plugin used for importing and exporting custom levels into the THUG2 format (as well as support for models from several other Tony Hawk games) was released in early 2017 by the user asdf; it was updated and re-released with expanded support and functionality in 2018 by the user denetii, which near coincided with update 0.6.0.0's support for importing custom levels. This plugin can be used to export fanmade levels or those imported from elsewhere into Blender to THUG Pro as well as character models that can be rigged to an armature to be used in game  Reception  A few months after the mod's initial beta launch, Luke Plunkett of Kotaku was optimistic about the idea of all levels in the series being available for online play. In reviews of the critically panned 2015 Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5, reviewers cited THUG Pro as a more enjoyable and affordable Tony Hawk's Pro Skater experience.

Przygodoskop negatively compared the title to Gemini Rue or the freeware game The Curfew. 4 Players deemed it a mediocre game that promised too much and delivered too little. Adventure-Treff felt that if readers wanted a good sci-fi experience, they were better off playing the then 6-year old title The Moment of Silence instead.

Dubbed a stone frigate, HMCS Nonsuch is a land-based naval establishment for part-time sailors as well as a local recruitment centre for the Canadian Forces Naval Reserve. It is one of 24 naval reserve divisions located in major cities across Canada.  Operations  Nonsuch is properly referred to as a ship, being commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy. She is part of the Reserves, and therefore operations are usually held on weekdays and certain weekends. However, her sailors may participate in any operation run by the Canadian Armed Forces year round, if they so choose.  History  HMCS Nonsuch was formed on 23 March 1927, as an RCN reserve half-company. On 1 November 1941 she was commissioned as a tender to , now part of CFB Esquimalt. She was commissioned as the independent unit, HMCS Nonsuch, on 1 September 1942. During World War 2, over 3500 sailors, and 114 officers were enlisted at Nonsuch. After the war she transitioned into a peacetime force, and was paid off on 30 November 1964. She was recommissioned on September 26, 1975. Nonsuch has two historic naval weapons outside of the building. One is a mark 12 5\\"/38 calibre gun, from the United States. It was originally to be used on a US Navy destroyer; however, the Second World War ended before the ship was built. The gun comes from a pair handed over to Canada for testing. The two guns were used to fire various ammunition in CFB Suffield, in southern Alberta. When they were deemed to have completed their jobs, they were turned over to HMCS Nonsuch and , located in Calgary. The second weapon Nonsuch has is a Bliss- Leavitt Mark 9 torpedo from the Second World War, as would have been launched from Canadian destroyers.

Early life Russell was born on June 21, 1838, in the Savin Hill section of Dorchester, Massachusetts to George R. and Sarah Parkinson (Shaw) Russell. His grandfather was ambassador Jonathan Russell and his first cousin was Robert Gould Shaw. Russell graduated from Harvard University in 1860. Military career Russell entered the Union Army on May 11, 1861, as a lieutenant in the 2nd Massachusetts Cavalry. He was promoted to captain on December 13, 1861. He was captured at the Battle of Cedar Mountain (August 9, 1862) and sent to Libby Prison. He was released in a prisoner exchange and returned to duty on November 15, 1862. On January 22, 1863, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. On April 5, 1864, he was made a colonel of the 5th Regiment Massachusetts Colored Volunteer Cavalry. When the regiment reached Washington D.C., Russell was briefly assigned command of a brigade at Camp Casey. On May 13 he was ordered to join General Edward Winslow Hincks' division in City Point, Virginia. On June 15, Russell was wounded in the Siege of Petersburg. He rejoined his regiment on September 30 at Point Lookout, Maryland, where his regiment was guarding Confederate prisoners of war. He resigned his command on February 15, 1865, and was brevetted brigadier general on March 13, 1865. Business career and family After the war, Russell joined J.M. Forbes & Co., where he sold goods from China and East India. In 1863 he married Mary Hathaway, the daughter of John Murray Forbes. The couple had five children. Government appointments In 1878, control of the Boston Police Department was transferred from the board of alderman to an independent police commission. Mayor Henry L. Pierce appointed Russell to chair the new board. Russell was credited with creating the harbor police, reorganizing the force on a semi-military basis (the first reorganization of the department since its founding in 1854), proposing new rules for conduct and definitions of duties, arranging for merit-based promotions, and instituting physical examinations for officers under the rank of captain. He left the board in 1880. In January 1895, he was appointed by Mayor Edwin Upton Curtis to succeed John R. Murphy on the Boston Fire commission. That July, Russell became the first solo commissioner in the department's history. During his tenure as commissioner, Russell hired and promoted based on merit rather than political considerations and worked to improve living conditions in the city's firehouses. He remained commissioner until his death on February 16, 1905. In 1909, a drinking fountain in memory of Russell was erected in Milton, Massachusetts, where he had been a summer resident for many years.

It was part of the infrastructure to be built as Sierra Leone prepared to shift its political and administrative capital, away from over-crowded Freetown. Location Mamamah Airport was to be located in Mamboima, near Songo Village, Koya Chiefdom in Port Loko District, approximately , by road, south-east of Freetown, the capital and largest city in the West African country. The average elevation of Songo Village is , above sea level. Overview This airport would be a large international airport capable of handling large passenger and cargo aircraft. The airport development was expected to be followed by the construction of a new State House, parliament building, ministry buildings, court houses and other support facilities. The developments were intended to improve Sierra Leone's competitiveness as the country prepares to become a middle income country by 2035. Other related development projects are the planned bridging of Tagrin Bay, which separates Freetown from the peninsula on which Lungi International Airport is located, and the ongoing expansion of the port of Freetown. The Mamamah airport contract has been terminated. The new SLPP government lead by President Maada Bio canceled the contract with the Chinese construction company, that contracted to build the proposed airport. Construction China Railway International Group had been contracted to build the airport at a cost of US$318 million, borrowed from the Exim Bank of China. Work began in March 2018 and completion was expected in 2022. Controversy This development project has drawn criticism from the World Bank (WB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) because of the level of debt that the country would be left with. Cancellation The project was cancelled in October 2018, following a change in government/president. The new Aviation Minister Kabineh Kallon said that the president saw no need for a new airport and preferred to refurbish Lungi International Airport and possibly build a bridge to link Lungi directly to Freetown. The Lungi Bridge project was later announced by the president.

Although it is typically viewed as a generalization of a group scheme, the notion itself involves no scheme theory. Because of this feature, some authors, notably Waterhouse and Milne (who followed Waterhouse),http://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/ develop the theory of group schemes based on the notion of group functor instead of scheme theory. A formal group is usually defined as a particular kind of a group functor.  Group functor as a generalization of a group scheme  A scheme may be thought of as a contravariant functor from the category \\\\mathsf{Sch}_S of S-schemes to the category of sets satisfying the gluing axiom; the perspective known as the functor of points. Under this perspective, a group scheme is a contravariant functor from \\\\mathsf{Sch}_S to the category of groups that is a Zariski sheaf (i.e., satisfying the gluing axiom for the Zariski topology). For example, if Γ is a finite group, then consider the functor that sends Spec(R) to the set of locally constant functions on it. For example, the group scheme :SL_2 = \\\\operatorname{Spec}\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\mathbb{Z}[a,b,c,d]}{(ad - bc - 1)} \\\\right) can be described as the functor :\\\\operatorname{Hom}_{\\\\textbf{CRing}}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mathbb{Z}[a,b,c,d]}{(ad - bc - 1)}, -\\\\right) If we take a ring, for example, \\\\mathbb{C}, then : \\\\begin{align} SL_2(\\\\mathbb{C}) &= \\\\operatorname{Hom}_{\\\\textbf{CRing}}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mathbb{Z}[a,b,c,d]}{(ad - bc - 1)}, \\\\mathbb{C}\\\\right)  &\\\\cong \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{bmatrix}a & b  c & d \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\in M_2(\\\\mathbb{C}) : ad-bc = 1 \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\end{align}  Group sheaf  It is useful to consider a group functor that respects a topology (if any) of the underlying category; namely, one that is a sheaf and a group functor that is a sheaf is called a group sheaf. The notion appears in particular in the discussion of a torsor (where a choice of topology is an important matter).

UN Command–Rear was established in 1957 as a result of the relocation of UN Command from Japan to South Korea following the Korean War. It is nominally in control of the rear elements of what the United States and South Korea contend are United Nations military forces in northeast Asia. In practice, UN Command–Rear is a legal cover created to prevent the expiration of the 1954 Status of Forces Agreement between the United States (operating as the \\"Unified Command\\") and Japan, which provides for its self- termination upon the withdrawal of United Nations forces from Japan. As of 2018, UN Command–Rear had a strength of four personnel. History =Background= The defeat of Japan in World War II led to the collapse of the Government of Korea under Japanese rule and the territorial bifurcation of the Korean Peninsula between the Pyongyang-based and Soviet-backed Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) and the Seoul-headquartered and United States-supported Republic of Korea (South Korea). On June 12, 1950, the South Korean Army informed the United States' Korean Military Advisory Group to the Republic of Korea that North Korea's Korean People's Army (KPA) was massing for an invasion. Approximately two weeks later, according to the United States and South Korea, the KPA staged a surprise assault against South Korean military positions along the border, easily overwhelming the South's defenses. North Korea advanced the alternate explanation that the entry of its forces into South Korea was done for the purposes of arresting Syngman Rhee due to what it claimed was a preemptive South Korean incursion that had taken place near Haeju. The ensuing conflagration sparked the Korean War between North and South Korea and their respective allies and patrons. Following the outbreak of hostilities, the United Nations Security Council voted to authorize armed intervention on the side of South Korea. The United States agreed to be named \\"executive agent\\" of the United Nations and, subsequently, formed United Nations Command. UN Command, under General Douglas MacArthur and his wartime successors, oversaw military operations on the Korean Peninsula from headquarters in Japan. =Formation= alt=U.S. military personnel pictured raising the colors of the United Nations over Yokosuka Naval Base Active hostilities concluded in 1953 and UN Command relocated from Japan to South Korea four years later. A 1954 Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) between the United States (signed as \\"the Government of the United States of America acting as the Unified Command\\") with Japan required UN Command to maintain a presence in that nation as a precondition for continued use of Japanese territory for military purposes. A break in the presence of forces under UN command in Japan would cause the termination of the SOFA and allow Japan to reassert total sovereignty over its territory. Specifically, Article 15 of the 1954 Status of Forces Agreement specifies that \\"this Agreement and agreed revisions thereof shall terminate on the date by which all the United Nations forces shall be withdrawn from Japan\\". United Nations Command–Rear was created as a legal construct to ensure the treaty requirements needed for indefinite use of Japanese territory were met, or what The Mandarin has described as \\"a form of legal trickery\\". UN Command–Rear describes its existence as one designed \\"to maintain the UN‐GOJ SOFA [United Nations-Government of Japan Status of Forces Agreement]\\". Upon formation of UN Command–Rear, it was decided that it should be placed under an officer who was not American so that it would not appear to be \\"a parochial US organisation\\". From 1957 to 1976, Thailand supplied an officer to UN Command–Rear, following which command responsibilities were assumed by the United Kingdom for two years. From 1978 until at least 1987, the Philippines provided an officer to lead UN Command Rear. Since 2010, Australia has made an officer available to the United States to be placed in command of UN Command–Rear. In 2007, UN Command–Rear relocated from its longtime headquarters at Camp Zama to Yokota Air Base. =Status= Status according to the United States The United States maintains that United Nations Command, to which United Nations Command–Rear answers, is a military organization of the United Nations. The U.S. also asserts that Security Council Resolution 84 made it the \\"executive agent\\" of the United Nations in Korea and that the UN had, through that process, delegated to the U.S. the authority to organize and command military forces on behalf of the UN and to independently determine when peace did or did not exist in Korea. Journalist Selig S. Harrison said the United States' reason for advancing this position instead of asserting a bilateral alliance between the U.S. and South Korea is substantially due to its desire to legally maintain perpetual access to Japanese territory, which is achieved via the existence of UN Command–Rear, without the requirement to seek prior Japanese approval. While the 1961 Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between the United States and Japan also gives the U.S. access to Japanese territory, it requires prior consultation with the Japanese government before American forces can enter Japan. Status according to the United Nations In 1994, United Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali stated that the UN \\"did not establish the unified command as a subsidiary organ under its control, but merely recommended the creation of such a command, specifying that it be under the authority of the United States\\" and that – since, in its view, the UN Command is not a UN body – only the U.S. can dissolve it. Narushige Michishita of the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies has signaled his agreement with that interpretation, explaining that United Nations Command–Rear is, for all intents and purposes, an organization of the United States Government. Status according to North Korea North Korea claims that the United States \\"used the United Nations as a tool of realizing their wild ambition of world domination ... and participated in the war in the guise of the UN flag in order to hide the true colours of war-maker\\". Pak Chol Gu of the Pyongyang- based Korean Anti-Nuclear Peace Committee has described UN Command as a \\"phantom body\\" and has said that \\"since the founding of the United Nations, such a command has existed only in South Korea\\". Operations =Authority= According to the Australian Defence Force Journal, UNC–R performs \\"certain administrative, support and liaison functions of a diplomatic type\\". Specifically, United Nations Command–Rear nominally has joint authority, with the United States, over seven UN-flagged bases in Japan: Camp Zama, Yokota Air Base, Yokosuka Naval Base, Sasebo Naval Base, Kadena Air Base, White Beach Naval Facility, and Marine Corps Air Station Futenma. In practice, all facilities are under the operational control of the United States. UN Command–Rear is also charged with providing legal notice to Japan regarding the entry of military forces from any of the nine SOFA co-signer states into Japanese territory, specifically, those of the United States, United Kingdom, Philippines, Australia, Canada, France, New Zealand, Turkey, and Thailand. Under the SOFA agreement, the movement of signatory state military forces into Japan can occur with or without Japanese approval. The agreement does require that a courtesy notice be provided to the Japanese government in advance of the entry of military forces into the country except in exigent circumstances in which case military forces can enter Japan without advance notification being given to the Japanese government. In 2014, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called for greater Japanese input into the operational use of US Forces Japan. In response, according to the Chosun Ilbo, the United States indicated that emergency deployment of U.S. forces could occur \\"automatically\\" and that \\"Tokyo would not have a say in the matter\\". The Chosun Ilbo noted that U.S. facilities in Japan are under UN Command–Rear and \\"thus there is no basis for Japan to meddle\\". =Personnel= As of 2007, United Nations Command–Rear had a strength of four personnel. According to Roger Chiasson, a former Canadian military officer who served as deputy commander of UN Command–Rear, his duties were \\"anything but onerous\\" and allowed him to live \\"a life of great privilege\\" during his assignment as second-in-command of the four-person unit, including access to various United States government-owned golf courses, stores, and a private hotel in downtown Tokyo.

Rodriguez, a Marine reservist with no prior criminal convictions, was in Lubbock for training at the time of the murder, and was also found to be responsible for the murder of 16-year-old Joanna Rogers in the same city the preceding May (the killings were linked by Rodriguez's modus operandi, as both victims were found stuffed into suitcases which ended up in the same Lubbock landfill). Rodriguez was executed at the Huntsville Unit on March 27, 2018, the day after his 38th birthday.  Background  Rodriguez was born on March 26, 1980, in Wichita Falls, northern Texas. He allegedly faced abuse from his alcoholic and domineering father, Rosendo Rodriguez Jr. He attended Texas Tech University in Lubbock, and had worked as an office clerk and as a fast food worker, as well as serving as a Marine reservist.  Murders  On September 13, 2005, the body of Summer Lee Baldwin was found in a Lubbock landfill. She was found to have died of asphyxiation and to have suffered numerous beatings. Summer, a 29-year-old native of Washington state, was working as a sex worker in Lubbock when she disappeared two days earlier, and had also been serving as a witness in a federal counterfeiting case, bringing her murder to the attention of the FBI. Summer was also around 5 weeks pregnant when she was killed, which served as an aggravating factor at Rodriguez's 2008 trial. Rodriguez was linked to the killing via a UPC code on the suitcase, and he had been arrested by September 15. He was also identified on CCTV footage as having bought the suitcase from a nearby Walmart in the early hours of September 12. In October 2006, the remains of Joanna Kathryn Rogers were found in the same landfill as that of Summer Baldwin after an extensive search. Joanna had been missing since May 2004. During his interrogation, Rodriguez claimed that he and Summer entered a hotel room on the night of September 11, had consensual sex through the early hours of September 12, and that Rodriguez strangled her after she pulled a knife on him. He told a similar story regarding Rogers, who he claimed became violent after he refused to pay her for having sex with him.  Trial, appeals, and execution  Rodriguez was initially offered a plea deal that involved him pleading guilty to the murders of both women, but he refused at the last minute. He was convicted of the capital murder of Summer, and he was sentenced to death by lethal injection. During his incarceration, he contributed to inmate blog Minutes before Six on matters of criminal justice and politics. Rodriguez's lawyer appealed the sentence based on a potential Brady disclosure violation by District Attorney Matt Powell for failing to disclose information regarding activities of the medical examiner who performed one of the autopsies. On October 30, 2017, an appeal by Rodriguez to the US Supreme Court was denied. He was executed as scheduled on March 27, 2018. In his final statement he called for investigation of Powell and medical examiner Sridhar Natarajan, saying they had been involved in multiple wrongful convictions. He also called for a boycott of Texas businesses until capital punishment is ended there.

While his early research interests revolved around natural user interfaces and interactive devices, his more recent research has been focussing on personal fabrication, such as 3D Printing and Laser cutting, as well as virtual reality and haptics. Prior to teaching and researching at Hasso Plattner Institute, Patrick Baudisch was a research scientist at Microsoft Research and Xerox PARC. He has been a member of CHI Academy since 2013, and an ACM distinguished scientist since 2014. He holds a PhD degree in Computer Science from the Department of Computer Science of the Technische Universität Darmstadt, Germany.  Research interests  Baudisch's research interests are natural user interfaces and interactive devices, which include miniature mobile devices, touch input, interactive floors, interactive rooms, and most recently, interactive fabrication.  Earlier publications on interaction techniques  Baudisch has had many publications, including but not limited to theses, book chapters, demos, videos and papers. His five most cited publications on Google Scholar Citations are: Precise selection techniques for multi-touch screens, Halo: a technique for visualizing off-screen objects, Shift: a technique for operating pen-based interfaces using touch, drag-and- pop and drag-and-pick: Techniques for accessing remote screen content on touch-and pen-operated systems and Lucid touch: a see-through mobile device. = Precise selection techniques for multi-touch screens = The paper Precise selection techniques for multi-touch screens was published on April 4, 2006 by Hrvoje Benko, Andrew D Wilson and Patrick Baudisch, totally cited 530 times. The paper presents five techniques called Dual Finger Selections to leverage multi-touch sensitive displays to help users select very small targets on display. This is to resolve the issues, in the terms of touch screen interactions, introduced by factors such as large finger size and the lack of sensing precision. To make use of the techniques, a user would adjust the control-display ratio using a secondary finger, while controlling the cursor movements using the primary finger. The paper also introduces SimPress, a clicking technique, which reduces motion errors during the process of clicking as well as enable hovering state on devices that are not able to support proximity. The user study in paper reported that in terms of error rate reduction, the 3 chosen techniques (Stretch, X-Menu, and Slider) outperformed the control technique and were favoured by the participants. Among the chosen techniques Stretch, X-menu and Slider, Stretch has the best performance and preference overall. = Halo: a technique for visualizing off-screen objects = The paper Halo: a technique for visualizing off-screen objects was published on April 5, 2003 by Patrick Baudisch and Ruth Rosenholtz, totally cited 453 times. The paper introduces Halo, a visualization technique that shows users the location of off-screen objects, to enable spatial cognition. Halo achieves this by showing parts of rings in border region of the display to indicate off screen objects. Users can then identify the exact location of the off-screen objects based on the location and portion of the rings that are visible. The paper reported that users completed tasks 16-33% faster, giving no significant differences on error rates within the scope of the study. = Shift: a technique for operating pen-based interfaces using touch = The paper Shift: a technique for operating pen-based interfaces using touch was published on April 29, 2007 by Daniel Vogel and Patrick Baudisch, totally cited 429 times. The paper proposes Shift, a pointing technique, so that users can touch target points on screens designed for styluses with high precision using their fingers rather than a stylus. Shift reduces targeting times and error rates by showing a copy of the targeted screen area at a separate location. Shift also shows a pointer to the actual selection point of the finger. Note that Shift is only enabled when the users find it necessary so that users have the option to have the conventional touch screen experience. Report results show that participants' actions have much lower error rates than an ordinary touch screen, and shorter times overall for larger targets compared to Offset Cursor. = Drag-and-pop and drag-and-pick: Techniques for accessing remote screen content on touch-and pen-operated systems = The paper Drag-and-pop and drag-and-pick: Techniques for accessing remote screen content on touch-and pen-operated systems was published in August, 2003 by Patrick Baudisch, Edward Cutrell, Dan Robbins, Mary Czerwinski, Peter Tandler, Benjamin Bederson and Alex Zierlinger, totally cited 405 times. The paper presents interaction techniques Drag-and-pop and drag-and-pick, designed for display systems based on pen and touch interactions, and they grant users the access to see contents on screen that are otherwise not easy to reach. Drag- and-pop extends traditional drag-and-drop. More specifically, drag-and-pop responds to users by moving the potential target icons in users' cursor direction temporarily, so that users only need to move their hands on a smaller distance or scale. Drag-and-pick further extends drag-and-pop by activating icons such as to open folders or applications. Results of study report that drag-and-pop interface enables participants to file icons as fast as 3.7 times than the traditional drag-and-drop interaction on a 15' wide display. = Lucid touch: a see-through mobile device = The paper Lucid touch: a see-through mobile device was published on October 7, 2007 by Daniel Wigdor, Clifton Forlines, Patrick Baudisch, John Barnwell and Chia Shen, totally cited 303 times. The paper focus on the difficult aspects of touch screens: touching the small screen of a mobile device can be inconvenient because users' hands and fingers could block the contents they plan to interact with. This paper introduces LucidTouch, a mobile device that users control from the back. LucidTouch displays an image of users' hands on screen, so that it gives the illusion that LucidTouch is transparent when in fact it is not. Users are able to interact with targets with greater precision because of the pseudo-transparency. Furthermore, like an ordinary mobile touch screen, LucidTouch reacts to multiple touch points at the same time so users can perform multi-touch actions Initial study results illustrate that because of factors such as improved accuracy, and unblocked view of the screen, many users prefer interactions with LucidTouch than interactions with conventional devices.

The purpose of the crime was to use the child's blood and body fat as a folk cure for a wealthy patron's tuberculosis.  Background  Francisco Leona At the time, it was believed that drinking the blood of a human child and using their body fat as cataplasm was a remedy for tuberculosis. Francisco Ortega El Moruno (The Moor) had recently been diagnosed with tuberculosis and was desperately seeking a cure. He visited the local curandera Agustina Rodriguez, who in turn sent for the barber and healer Francisco Leona. Leona, who also had a criminal record, agreed to cure Ortega in exchange for 3000 reales. Leona and Julio El Tonto (The Fool) Hernández, a son of Agustina the healer, offered to find a child. On the evening of June 27, 1910, Francisco Leona kidnapped Bernardo Gonzalez Parra, a seven year old from Rioja, drugged him with chloroform and put him in a sack.  Murder  A brother of Julio \\"Tonto\\" Hernández, Joseph Hernández, was to advise the client Ortega, leaving his wife Elena to make dinner. Little Bernardo's murder was as follows: after he was removed from the sack, dazed, Bernardo was stabbed in the heart by Leona, and Ortega mixed his blood with sugar and drank it. After that they took the boy to a place known as Las Pocicas where Leona killed him, crushing his skull with a rock. Then he extracted fat and mesentery to make a compress to apply to Ortega's chest. To finish the ritual, Bernardo's body was concealed in a crevice, unburied but covered with herbs and stones, located in Las Pocicas. When distributing the actual 3000 Ortega paid him for his services, the healer Leona tried and failed to trick his accomplice Tonto Hernández. Realizing Leona's intentions, Hernández told the Civil Guard who had seen the body of a child while he was chasing partridges.  Judicial and police intervention  Cortijo de San Patricio at present When law enforcement officers arrived, the people of Gádor turned Leona over to them, as he was known for his illegal and occult practices. During court proceedings, Leona indicted el Tonto Hernández in his testimony, who in turn did the same to Leona. Finally, after multiple excuses, both confessed to the crime. Most of the perpetrators were executed by hanging. Leona was sentenced to death by garrote, but died in prison. The client, Ortega, and Agustina, the curandera, were both sentenced to death. Joseph Hernández, was sentenced to 17 years in prison while his wife, Elena, was acquitted. Julio el Tonto was sentenced to death too, but received a pardon on grounds of insanity following a psychiatric report.  Aftermath  This crime gave rise to the terms Hombre del saco and Sacamantecas, because the kidnapers used a gunny sack to carry the children. It was defined as \\"medical crime,\\" inspired by folk beliefs about the medicinal properties of human blood and children's manteca. A TV episode named El sacamantecas was released in 1986. A documentary directed by Juan Francisco Viruega and named La cicatriz was released on 21 November 2019 during the Festival de Cine de Almería.

The process of decomposition is complex. Microbes decompose cadavers, but other organisms including fungi, nematodes, insects, and larger scavenger animals also contribute. Once the immune system is no longer active, microbes colonizing the intestines and lungs decompose their respective tissues and then travel throughout the body via the blood and lymphatic systems to break down other tissue and bone. During this process, gases are released as a by-product and accumulate, causing bloating. Eventually, the gases seep through the body’s wounds and natural openings, providing a way for some microbes to exit from the inside of the cadaver and inhabit the outside. The microbial communities colonizing the internal organs of a cadaver are referred to as the thanatomicrobiome. The region outside of the cadaver that is exposed to the external environment is referred to as the epinecrotic portion of the necrobiome, and is especially important when determining the time and location of death for an individual. Different microbes play specific roles during each stage of the decomposition process. The microbes that will colonize the cadaver and the rate of their activity are determined by the cadaver itself and the cadaver’s surrounding environmental conditions.  History  There is textual evidence that human cadavers were first studied around the third century BC to gain an understanding of human anatomy. Many of the first human cadaver studies took place in Italy, where the earliest record of determining the cause of death from a human corpse dates back to 1286. However, understanding of the human body progressed slowly, in part because the spread of Christianity and other religious beliefs resulted in human dissection becoming illegal. Thus, non-human animals were solely dissected for anatomical understanding until the 13th century when officials realized human cadavers were necessary for a better understanding of the human body. It was not until 1676 that Antonie van Leeuwenhoek designed a lens that made it possible to visualize microbes, and not until the late 18th century when microbes were considered useful in understanding the body after death. Modern sophisticated molecular techniques have made it possible to identify the microbial communities that inhabit and decompose cadavers, but more advanced research is fairly new, and therefore poorly understood. Studying the necrobiome has become increasingly useful in determining the time and cause of death. so more recent research can have crime-solving applications.  Necrobiome applications  = Forensic entomology = Forensic entomology, the study of insects (arthropods) found in decomposing humans is the most popular field of study used in determining the post-mortem interval (PMI). This technique, however, is still new and consistently being improved, and—as such—it can work well with other techniques such as forensic anthropology, though forensic entomology is not as dependable on its own yet. Forensic entomologists often work within the field of crime scene investigations and are a part of the crime scene expert team that analyzes and collects evidence regarding a suspicious death. Typically, the minimum education required for this particular position is a Doctorate in Forensic Science. Forensic entomologists are experts in their field, and thus require a professional certification with the American Board of Forensic Entomology. As another relatively new field, forensic microbiologists, studying the presence of microbes, began investigating ways to determine time and place of death by analyzing the microbes present on the corpse. This would become an integral part of crime solving in later years upon the invention of the microbial clock process. The microbial timeline in which the body decays has been given the term “microbial clock,” this estimates how long a body has been in a certain place based on microbes present or missing. The succession of bacterial species populating the body after a period of four days is an indicator of minimum time since death (MTD). The presence or absence of maggots, as well as their age, can also be used to determine time of death; If the maggot is only a few days old, then the cadaver could not have been dead for longer than this time. = Microbial forensics = As the necrobiome deals with the various communities of bacteria and organisms that catalyze the decomposition of plants and animals (See Figure 1), this particular biome is an increasingly vital part of forensic science. The microbes occupying the space underneath and around a decomposing body are unique to it—similar to how fingerprints are exclusively unique to only one person. Using this differentiation, forensic investigators at a crime scene are able to distinguish between burial sites. This would provide concrete factual information about how long the body has been there and the predicted area in which the death possibly occurred. As the progression of research regarding microbial forensics and the necrobiome continues to be refined and improved, the need for new forensic scientists and microbiologists becomes increasingly necessary. When a crime such as murder has transpired, a team of crime scene specialists or forensic science experts are called to the scene to collect evidence and examine the body. These experts range from forensic odontologists to forensic microbiologists (See Figure 2). Together, they can obtain the necessary elements needed in order to properly reconstruct the victim’s demise.  Cadavers and carcasses  One way many people study how bodies decompose is through the use of body farms. There are seven research facilities in the US that are home to body farms: University of Tennessee in Knoxville, Western Carolina University, Texas State University, Sam Houston State University, Southern Illinois University, Colorado Mesa University, and University of South Florida. These facilities study the decomposition of cadavers in all possible manners of decay, including in open or frozen environments, buried underground, or within cars. Through the study of the cadavers, experts examine the microbial timeline and document what’s normal in each stage in the various locations that each body is placed. An experiment was conducted to study the change in the necrobiome within a carcass and they performed it. The experiment was conducted to study the relative abundance of organisms in the necrobiome and the changes that occur during three different stages. For the experiment, they used six dead rabbits purchased from a pet food company. The rabbits were purchased from Kiezebank and exposed on top of a roof at the University of Huddersfield in West Yorkshire, United Kingdom. The rabbits were dead prior to purchase. Three of the rabbits’ fur were removed from the torso to identify any difference in necrobiome abundance. Samples were collected from inside of the mouth, the upper skin of the torso exposed to the air environment, and the bottom skin of the torso that’s touched by the soil. Active, advanced, and decay stages were examined, and proteobacteria were the most abundant present, followed by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria during the active stage of decomposition (Figure 3). During the advanced stage of decomposition, Proteobacteria decreased from 99.4% to 81.6% in the oral cavity but were most abundant in the non-fur samples. It was distinguished that Firmicutes were the most abundant for the skin samples in both fur and non-fur samples. Finally, Proteobacteria was most abundant in the soil interface during the beginning of decomposition in both fur and non-fur samples. Also, they noted that Actinobacteria was the least abundant in the active stage and decreased even more during the dry stage.  Decomposition  The manner in which bacteria colonize a cadaver is predictable when examining the time since death. Only recent studies have taken place to determine if bacteria alone can inform the postmortem interval. Bacteria responsible for decomposing cadavers can be difficult to study because the bacteria found on a cadaver varies and changes quickly. Bacteria can be brought to a cadaver by scavengers, air, or water. Other environmental factors like temperature and soil can impact the microbes found on a cadaver. Fortunately, microbial colonization between humans and animals is so similar, that animal models can be used to understand the decomposition process for humans. Human cadavers are used for research, but animal models provide larger sample sizes and produce more controlled studies. Swine models have been used repeatedly to understand the human decomposition process in terrestrial environments. Swine are suitable for studying human decomposition because of their size, sparse hairs, and similar bacteria found in their GI tracts.  Technology and techniques  An algorithm has been developed to accurately predict time since death with an accuracy of within two days. Techniques for analyzing the necrobiome have now been coupled with forensic entomology, such as phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, total soil fatty acid methyl esters, and DNA profiling. Pig carcasses have also become a tool to understand human microbiology, minimizing the issue of variation that exists when using human cadavers as study subjects. This technology is used to simplify the sample collection into sequences that scientists can read. The simplified sequence of the necrobiome is run through a data bank to match the name of it. Due to the lack of universal algorithm technology, there is a knowledge gap in various platforms across different regions of the world. In order to close that gap, there needs to be an expansion of the technology. However, there are a few obstacles, including identifying needs, research, prototype development, acceptance, and adoption. Overcoming these obstacles would assist many organizations that are involved with forensic science. Also, it would increase the understanding of the necrobiome and growth of developing a successful accurate multi-step experiment. The samples are loaded into a machine to generate and analyze DNA sequences of the microbiome. Algorithms are done in a lab on a computer program to read and match the sequences within the data bank. The results return very quickly within a few minutes to the latest days.

In October 2017, Vimal denied signing the film and dispelled reports that a sequel was in production for producer Nazir. In a turn of events in February 2018, Sarkunam shelved his proposed film with Madhavan and announced that he would make a sequel to Kalavani. He launched his own production house, Varmans Productions, to fund the film and cast Vimal Oviya, while titling the project as K2. Soon after Sarkunam's announcement, Nazir revealed that he was unhappy at this proposal, and that he would begin work on a separate film titled Kalavani 2 as he had the original rights to the title. He suggested that production would begin in mid-2018 after he had finished making a film titled Vadam with Poonam Kaur. Despite the ongoing issue, Sarkunam began shooting the film with Vimal in February 2018, with Oviya joining the team in May 2018.

These peoples dwelt from the east Carpathian Mountains and Tyras (Dniester) river in the north, to the north coast of the Aegean Sea in the south, from the west coast of the Pontus Euxinus (Black Sea) in the east, to roughly the South Morava river basin, Tisia (Tisza) and Danube rivers in the west. This list is based in the possible ethnolinguist affiliation of these peoples - Geto-Dacians, Moesians, Thracians and Paeonians (including possibly or partly Thracian or Dacian tribes) and not only on a geographical base (that includes other peoples that were not Dacians or Thracians like the Celts that lived in Dacia or in Thrace). Paleo-Balkan languages in Eastern Europe between 5th and 1st century BC Daco-Moesians Map of the geographical distribution of attested placenames with the -dava suffix, according to Olteanu (2010). The dava distribution confirms Dacia and Moesia as the zone of Dacian speech. The dava zone is, with few exceptions, consistent with Ptolemy's definition of Dacia's borders. There is no conclusive evidence that Dacian was a predominant language outside the dava zone in the 1st century AD. According to Strabo, the Thracians spoke the same language as the Dacians, in which case Dacian was spoken as far as the Aegean sea and the Bosporus. But Strabo's view is controversial among modern linguists: dava placenames are absent south of the Balkan mountains, with one exception (see Thracian, below) Dacian kingdom during the reign of Burebista, 82 BC, showing Dacian and Getae tribes.

First appearing in the 6th century bc, the Getae were subjected to Scythian influence and were known as expert mounted archers and devotees of the deity Zalmoxis. Although the daughter of their king became the wife of Philip II of Macedon in 342 BC, the Macedonians under Philip II’s son Alexander crossed the Danube and burned the Getic capital seven years later. Getic technology was influenced by that of the invading Celts in the 4th and 3rd centuries bc. Under Burebistas (fl. 1st century BC), the Getae and nearby Dacians formed a powerful but short-lived state. By the middle of the following century, when the Romans had gained control over the lower Danube region, thousands of Getae were displaced, and, not long thereafter, references to the Getae disappeared from history. Later writers wrongly gave the name Getae to the Goths. The Getae and Dacians were closely related; some historians even suggest that these were names applied to a single people by different observers or at different times.

He then put out a report, that he had decided to climb up to heaven, in order to inform Hera of the disobedience of the Thracians. The Thracians, who are notoriously stupid and ridiculous, were terrified by the idea of their general's intended journey, and the resulting wrath of heaven. They implored him not to carry out his plan, and they promised with an oath to obey all of his future commands. **Cicones **CoelaletaeThe Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 3, Part 2: The Assyrian and Babylonian Empires and Other States of the Near East, from the Eighth to the Sixth Centuries BC by John Boardman, I.

It is a common and widespread, late flowering species growing in grassland and woodland habitats at higher altitudes. It has a tuft of up to nine leaves at the base and up to four slightly drooping bright yellow flowers with dark streaks in the centre. Description Diuris monticola is a tuberous, perennial herb with between five and nine narrow linear leaves long and wide in a loose tuft. Up to four slightly drooping bright yellow flowers with dark streaks in the centre and wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal leans forward and is egg-shaped, long and wide. The lateral sepals are lance-shaped to egg-shaped, the narrower end towards the base, long, wide, lean downwards and parallel to each other. The petals are egg-shaped, long, wide and spread apart from each other on a blackish stalk long. The labellum is long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is egg-shaped, long and wide and the side lobes are linear to narrowly wedge-shaped, long and wide with irregular edges. There are two pimply, darker yellow callus ridges in the lower part of the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs from November to January. Taxonomy and naming Diuris monticola was first formally described in 1998 by David Jones from a specimen collected near Tantangara Dam and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. Jones derived the specific epithet (monticola) from the Latin mons meaning \\"mountain\\" and -cola meaning \\"dweller\\", referring to the montane habitat of this species. Distribution and habitat Highland golden moths is widespread and common in montane grassland, and snowgum woodland in the higher parts of southern New South Wales, Tasmania, the Australian Capital Territory and north-eastern Victoria.

He played collegiately with the Connecticut Huskies from 1993 to 1997 before being suspended during his senior season for violating National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) rules. In 1997, he was drafted into the Continental Basketball Association (CBA), the now-defunct developmental league of the National Basketball Association (NBA). While never reaching the NBA, King played professionally for several years in the CBA, the United States Basketball League, the International Basketball League, the Philippines, Greece, Puerto Rico and Venezuela. Early life and amateur career Born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, King attended Southern Lab High School. He led the school's basketball team to two state championships during his junior and senior seasons. He played for the People to People Student Ambassador Program basketball team which traveled to the Dominican Republic in 1994, Italy in 1995 and Spain in 1996. King opted to attend the University of Connecticut instead of a Louisiana university following a visit to Connecticut and a tour of the campus. After averaging 2.9 points per game in his first two seasons as a reserve player with the Connecticut Huskies, King was given the starting small forward spot going into his junior season (1995–96). On January 10, 1996, King set a career high in points with 20 on 10-of-10 shooting from the field, tying a Big East Conference record for number of field goals made in a game without a miss. In January 1996, King made 22 straight field goals, three shy on the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) record of 25-for-25. Going into the 1996–97 season, King was the only player on UConn's roster that had experience as a starter and was named the team's captain. In January 1997, the NCAA announced that King and UConn sophomore Ricky Moore had been suspended for accepting free airline tickets from agent John Lounsbury to fly back to Connecticut in October 1995. King's suspension was for the remainder of his senior season. The NCAA gave King a longer suspension than Moore because according to their investigation King knew he was violating NCAA rules. UConn was later stripped of their wins during their 1996 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament run and ordered them to pay back $90,970 in money the school made during the postseason. The team made King an undergraduate assistant coach following his suspension, allowing him to attend practices, travel with the team and sit on their bench during games. Huskies head coach Jim Calhoun told the Hartford Courant, \\"Kirk King made a mistake; nothing more, nothing less. I think he should be able to play, but I don't run the NCAA. What Kirk said to us was more than compelling to me. Apparently, it wasn't for other people. I can't control that.\\" King graduated from Connecticut with a bachelor's degree in sociology. Professional career Following his graduation in 1997, King was drafted in the fifth round (46 overall) by the Connecticut Pride in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA). During his rookie season in the CBA, King averaged 10.9 points per game and 4.5 rebounds. He was named the CBA's American Conference Player of the Week on January 3, 1998. King had brief stints playing for the Connecticut Skyhawks in the United States Basketball League (USBL) in 1997 and 1998. King played for the Guaiqueríes de Margarita of the Liga Profesional de Baloncesto in Venezuela in 1998. During the off-season before the 1998–99 season, King worked out with the New York Knicks of the National Basketball Association (NBA), but was cut from the team before the preseason. He signed with the La Crosse Bobcats of the CBA in 1998, but was later traded to the Rockford Lightning. In 1999, King played briefly with a professional team based in Aibonito, Puerto Rico. Going into the 1999–2000 season, King signed with the Trenton Shooting Stars of the International Basketball League (IBL). King signed with the San Diego Stingrays of the IBL in January 2000. In the summer of 2000, King played professional basketball in the Philippines. King re- joined the Connecticut Pride in the CBA before the league ceased operations and filed for bankruptcy in February 2001. He was named to the CBA All-Star game during the 2000–01 season. He also played with the Baltimore Bayrunners in the IBL during the 2000–01 season. Following the IBL season, King signed with the Toros de Aragua of the Liga Profesional de Baloncesto in Venezuela. Later that year, King joined the Piratas de Quebradillas in the Baloncesto Superior Nacional, Puerto Rico's top-tier men's professional basketball league. In 2001, King signed with A.O. Near East B.C. in the Greek Basket League in Greece. During the 2001–02 season, King averaged 14.2 points per game and 10 rebounds in 26 games played. King last played for Gaiteros del Zulia in the Venezuelan Liga Profesional de Baloncesto in 2005 before a knee injury forced him to retire.

In older lists of the bishops of Meissen he is numbered as Bruno III because of the inclusion of an earlier Bruno II, who was a clerical error.  Life  Along with the Přemyslid Kings of Bohemia Bruno was one of the most active participants in the German settlement of Upper Lusatia. For one thing, this was the location of the majority of the estates of the bishops of Meissen; for another, Bruno was keen in this way to secure his power in Upper Lusatia against the inroads of the Bohemians. In 1228 he was removed from his office by Pope Gregory IX, presumably because of his reckless behaviour, and died on 4 December in the same year. His body was buried in the crypt of the collegiate church in Bautzen, which he had founded himself between 1213 and 1218. In 1225 Bruno dedicated the Chapel of St. George in the Matthias Gatelater rebuilt as the Matthias Tower in Ortenburg, Bautzen.

Prior to the completion of this building, the national records were kept at the present day National Agricultural Research Organization (NARO) Secretariat, in the basement of a former colonial administration building in Entebbe. Location The building is located at Plot 8-9 Lourdel Road in the Wandegeya neighborhood, in the Central Division of Kampala, Uganda's capital and largest city, about north of the city's business district. The coordinates of the building are: 00°19'56.0\\"N, 32°34'42.0\\"E (Latitude:0.332222; Longitude:32.578333). Overview The National Archives Center is administered by the Uganda Ministry of Public Service. Prospective researchers who intend to use the archives, require clearance from the National Council for Science and Technology. The clearance certificate costs US$300 for non-Ugandans and US$50 for Ugandan academics including postgraduate students pursuing Masters and Doctoral degrees. Undergraduates attending Ugandan universities are not charged a fee, but they require written clearance from their respective universities and from the National Council for Science and Technology. Construction Construction of the building is progressing in phases. The construction of the first phase started in 2013 and was completed in 2015 at a cost of USh20.8 billion (US$5.8 million), using a USh20.3 billion (US$5.7 million) loan from the International Development Association (IDA) through the World Bank. The second phase is expected to cost USh28.6 billion (US$7.9 million). About USh5 billion (US$1.2 million) is needed to enable the center operate fully. The building is being developed in phases, due to insufficient funds.

She lies in of water 16 miles northeast of Port Washington, Wisconsin. On April 12, 2016 her wreck was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History Senator loading coal Senator (Official number 116725) was built in 1896 by the Detroit Dry Dock Company of Wyandotte, Michigan. Her hull had an overall length of , and she was between her perpendiculars, her beam was wide and her cargo hold was deep. She had a gross register tonnage of 4048.75 tons and a net tonnage of 3178.66 tons. She was powered by a triple expansion steam engine which was fueled by two coal-burning Scotch marine boilers. Senator was launched on June 20, 1896 as hull number #122. She entered service on July 25, 1896. Senator was used to carry bulk cargoes such as iron ore, coal and later automobiles. She was also built using two unique early Great Lakes bulk carrier building techniques which were steel arches and a moveable water ballast system. She was originally owned by the Wolverine Steamship Company of Detroit, Michigan. At the time of Senator launching, the newspaper Marine Review wrote two articles speaking of the steamer's characteristics. The first article published on June 11, 1896 reads: > Matters in the ship yard of the Detroit Dry Dock Co. at Wyandotte are being > arranged for the launching of the big steel steamer Senator on Saturday, the > 13th.

Murray was an American lawyer born in Barbados on August 25, 1933. He immigrated to the United States in 1950, earning his Bachelor's degree from Howard University in 1954 and the Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) degree from Fordham University School of Law in 1960. Upon graduation from law school he became an assistant district attorney in New York County (Manhattan). In 1962, he became assistant counsel to Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York. From 1965 to 1967, he was in private practice in New York City, then became counsel to the New York State Crime Control Council until 1971. Murray served as Commissioner of the State of New York's Division of Criminal Justice Services from 1972 to 1974. On January 1, 1975, he began a lengthy career at The Legal Aid Society, serving from 1975 to 1994 as Attorney-in-Chief and Executive Director, and later as Chairman of the Board until 1998. Murray was said to have \\"helped to raise the standard of the free legal advice provided for poor and indigent defendants facing criminal charges in New York City.\\" Murray was the first African-American president of the New York State Bar Association and the second African-American chairman of the executive committee of the New York City Bar Association. He died on September 16, 2001, in New York City, survived by his wife of 40 years, Kay Crawford Murray.  Honors  During his lifetime, Murray was awarded honorary Doctor of Laws degrees from New York Law School (1988), John Jay College of Criminal Justice (City University of New York) (1990), and Fordham University (1992). Murray's alma mater, Fordham University School of Law, has established both an Archibald R. Murray Public Service Award and an Archibald R. Murray Professorship. The former is awarded to students in the graduating class of the law school who have devoted 50 or more hours to pro bono and/or community service work during their years as Fordham law students. Those graduates completing 250–499 hours receive the cum laude Murray Award, those completing 500–999 hours the magna cum laude Murray Award, and students completing 1000+ hours receive the summa cum laude Murray Award. The text of the award reads, \\"in grateful acknowledgment of your response to the call of public need as exemplified by Archibald R. Murray, Class of 1960, whose career embodies the highest standards of public service.\\" As of Fall 2017, the Fordham University School of Law Archibald R. Murray Professorship was held by Tanya K. Hernández. In 2007, The Legal Aid Society announced the creation of the Archibald R. Murray Memorial Fund for Law Student Loan Forgiveness \\"to honor the memory of Arch Murray and celebrate his many accomplishments that helped to provide quality legal services for low-income New Yorkers.\\"  Notable Letters, Memoranda and Statements  In April 1974, while serving as Commissioner at the Division of Criminal Justice Services, Murray authored a memorandum addressed to the Office of Governor Malcolm Wilson opposing the signing of a bill, Assembly Bill No. 8667-A, that made mere possession of \\"chuka sticks\\" or nunchaku a crime even without any criminal intent by the possessor. Murray noted in the memo that nunchaku are used in karate and other martial arts training and that, \\"in view of the current interest and participation in these activities by many members of the public, it appears unreasonable--and perhaps even unconstitutional--to prohibit those who have a legitimate reason for possessing chuka sticks from doing so.\\" On December 14, 2018, Murray's vision was given real-world application: the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York struck down New York's nunchaku prohibitions as unconstitutional. In December 1974, after it was announced that Murray had been chosen to run The Legal Aid Society, and the president of the union that represented most of its staff lawyers had expressed reservations about Murray's suitability because in his prior office he had strongly supported the Rockefeller drug laws and mandatory sentencing, Murray was directly quoted in the New York Times as having responded: \\"As a lawyer, I see nothing difficult in arguing a case in which you are on one side today and the other side tomorrow.\\" In September 1982, in an article in New York magazine about the challenges then being faced by The Legal Aid Society, Murray was directly quoted as saying: \\"As soon as people became afraid of crime, they began to lose their balance and forget that defendants have rights, too.\\" In October 1994, in the wake of Mayor Rudy Giuliani's decision to terminate New York City's contract with The Legal Aid Society, Murray sent a letter to the City's Corporation Counsel, Paul A. Crotty, arguing that Giuliani had no legal basis for terminating the contract. In the letter, Murray pointed out that, during a brief strike by Legal Aid Society staff lawyers earlier that month, Legal Aid Society supervisors had handled civil and criminal cases so that \\"no chaos or gridlock resulted in the courts.\\"  References  Category:1933 births Category:2001 deaths Category:African- American lawyers Category:Barbadian men Category:Fordham University School of Law alumni Category:Howard University alumni ","title":"Archibald R.

Early life and education  Gregor was born in San Francisco and raised in Tahoe City, California by a family supportive of her academic exploration in the liberal arts. She holds a BFA in Studio Art from University of California, Santa Cruz in 1983, where she studied printmaking, ceramics, Eastern religion and French Symbolist poetry. After undergraduate school, Gregor conducted informal studies in ceramics through extensive travel abroad. In 1994, she received her MFA in Ceramics from San Francisco State University, where she studied under sculptor Stephen DeStaebler.  Work  Gregor is known for her abstracted human figure sculptures, featuring complex layers of underglaze and glaze and occasionally metallic lusters. Gregor builds her forms out of solid clay, then slices them open with a strong wire to enable hollowing as the clay enters its dryer 'leather hard' stage. She then reassembles the pieces for drying and kiln firing. Each piece endures as many as seven or eight firings, giving them their characteristic liquid, yet hard surfaces. Her works, some up to life- size in scale, convey a sense of balance and mass, seemingly on the edge of flight. Despite their grandiosity, Gregor's figures often carry a humility, a restraint in gesture and expression. Gregor has been called a 'descendant' of sculptors as diverse as Robert Arneson, Peter Voulkos and Viola Frey, and is considered an important second-generation sculptor in the Bay Area Figurative Group, succeeding artists such as Manuel Neri and Stephen DeStaebler. Her contemporaries include Susannah Israel, John Toki, Arthur Gonzalez and Lisa Reinertson.  Teaching  Gregor is a tenured Professor of Art and head of the ceramics program at San Jose City College, where since 2002 she has taught ceramics, sculpture and 3-D design. She has held sculpting the human figure in clay workshops at Office for the Arts at Harvard, Mendocino Arts Center, Berkeley Potters' Studio, and Sierra Nevada College, among other colleges and art centers across the United States. She has instructed ceramic sculpture workshops abroad at Estudio Paloma in San Miguel de Allende, MX, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Fellow ceramic artists from the United States and Mexico teaching at Estudio Paloma include Tip Toland, Esther Shimazu, Adrian Arleo and Claudia Olds Goldie. As part of its annual series of workshops given by some of the finest international ceramic artists worldwide, Gaya Ceramic Arts Center in Ubud Bali, Indonesia hosted a figure sculpture workshop by Gregor in 2018. Gregor has given hands-on demonstrations of sculpture making and lectured widely about figuration in clay at ceramic art exhibitions and symposia, including the Annual California Conference for the Advancement of Ceramic Arts (CCACA) and Ceramic Sculptors Exhibition and Conference and Ceramics Annual of America (CAA), an exhibition and art fair spotlighting the quality and diversity of contemporary ceramics from around the world.

It was founded in 2015 by Tim Ellis and Jordan Noone. Relativity is developing manufacturing technologies, launch vehicles and rocket engines for commercial orbital launch services.  History  Relativity Space was founded by CEO Tim Ellis and CTO Jordan Noone on the idea that existing new space companies were not tapping enough into the potential of additive manufacturing. Relativity is aiming to be the first company to successfully launch a fully 3D printed launch vehicle into orbit. Relativity announced its Series C funding in October 2019, bringing its total funding amount to US$185.7 million. Relativity is privately funded by Bond, Tribe Capital, Playground Global, Social Capital, Y Combinator, and Mark Cuban. The company says it will launch its first rocket, named Terran 1, in the fall of 2021.  Facilities  = Headquarters = Relativity announced a new 120,000-square-foot Long Beach, CA headquarters and factory in February 2020. This new headquarters houses both business operations and Relativity's state-of-the-art autonomous factory. According to an interview with Ellis, the factory has no fixed tooling, which allows it to be rapidly reconfigured and autonomous. = Stennis Space Center = In March 2018, Relativity Space signed a 20-year lease at the John C. Stennis Space Center, a NASA rocket testing facility, to test engine components and eventually test full-scale Aeon 1 rocket engines. And in June 2019, Relativity expanded their work with John C. Stennis Space Center to include exclusive use of 220,000 square feet within Building 9101. Relativity plans to create 200 jobs and invest $59M in Mississippi over the course of this nine-year lease, which carries an option to extend for another 10 years. = Cape Canaveral LC-16 = In January 2019, Relativity announced that it won a competitive bidding process with the United States Air Force to build and operate Launch Complex 16 (LC-16) at Cape Canaveral. LC-16 has historical significance and was previously used by the US military to launch Titan and Pershing ballistic missiles. = Vandenberg Air Force Base Building 330 = In June of 2020, Relativity announced it plans to develop a second launch pad at Vandenberg Air Force Base to allow for missions to polar orbits and sun-synchronous orbits, including the launches carrying Iridium satellites, between 2023 and 2030.  Customers  Relativity has pre- sold more launches than any other company in the private space industry since SpaceX. = Timeline of publicly announced launch contracts = In June 2020, Relativity announced that they signed a new launch contract with Iridium. This contract included up to six dedicated launches to deploy ground spare satellites to LEO for Iridium NEXT’s constellation on Relativity’s Terran 1 vehicle. According to Suzi McBride, Iridium's COO, the satellite communication provider chose to partner with Relativity because of their flexible launch capability and the company's ability to launch one satellite at a time. According to the deal these launches will not begin earlier than 2023. In September 2019, Relativity and Momentus announced their launch service agreement at the 2019 World Satellite Business Week in Paris. The agreement stated that Relativity's Terran 1 launch vehicles will carry Momentus’ Vigoride \\"tug\\" service vehicles into orbit. The contract is for a half-dozen missions. In May 2019, Relativity signed a contract with Spaceflight Industries, a satellite rideshare and mission management provider, to launch Spaceflight’s dedicated smallsat rideshares. The terms of this deal were not disclosed, however, it was shared that the contract included one launch of Relativity’s Terran 1 rocket in the third quarter of 2021, with an option for an unspecified number of additional launches. Relativity publicly announced their contract with mu Space in April late 2019. It is expected that Relativity will launch a mu Space satellite to low Earth orbit in the second half of 2022, aboard Relativity's Terran 1 rocket. On April 5, 2019, Relativity announced its first signed contract. This contract was with Telesat, the Canadian telecom satellite operator. The terms of this contract were not specified, but it did include \\"multiple\\" launches of Terran 1. Lockheed Martin announced on October 16, 2020 that it will launch a cryogenic liquid hydrogen management demonstration mission on Terran 1. Lockheed Martin also specified that the launch will make use of Momentus' Vigoride orbital transfer vehicle to house the cryogenic payload. This announcement came two days after NASA announced the recipients of its Tipping Point awards.  3D-printing  In order to 3D print large components, Relativity has created a system named Stargate, which it claims is the world's largest 3D printer of metals. The system is based on selective laser sintering, which uses laser beams to bond powdered metal, layer by layer, into precise and complex structures that have minimal parts. The company aims at 3D-printing at least 95% of their launcher, including the engines, by the end of 2020. The company plans to eventually 3D-print a complete launch vehicle within 60 days.  Aeon 1 rocket engine  The Aeon 1 rocket engine first stage is designed to create 15,500 pounds of thrust (68975 newtons of force) at sea level and 25,400 pounds of thrust (86775 newtons) in a vacuum. The engine is powered by liquid natural gas and liquid oxygen (LOX). It is made out of a proprietary 3D-printed alloy. It is 3D-printed and assembled from fewer than 1000 parts. Relativity has completed more than 300 test firings of the Aeon 1 engine, using the E-3 facility at NASA's John C. Stennis Space Center in Mississippi.  Terran 1 launch vehicle  The Terran 1 is an expendable launch vehicle under development that will consist of two stages. The first stage will use 9 Aeon 1 engines, while the second stage will use a single Aeon 1 engine. The maximum payload will be to 185 km low Earth orbit, normal payload to 500 km SSO sun-synchronous orbit, high-altitude payload to 1200 km SSO. The rocket will not use helium for pressure but will use autogenous pressurization. Relativity's advertised launch price of US$12 million per Terran 1 mission.

She was actively involved in college, so much so that she sometimes couldn’t make it home for Christmas. Her father gave her only a thousand dollars as she left college because that’s all he could afford to give her. Her mother passed away a few months before she graduated from college. Career After graduating from college, Wilma was meant to teach high school, but she ended up teaching first graders due to lack of jobs for high school teachers. After a year, she took a job in her hometown as a Math teacher, where she worked for four years and made about ninety dollars a month. Since teachers only worked for nine months in the year, she made about eight hundred and ten dollars a year. Due to the demise of her mother, Wilma was responsible for taking care of the house while her siblings were in high school. Thereafter, she worked in a payroll office and later as a code clerk at the unemployment census.

She worked at the Civil Service Commission as a junior Civil Service Examiner and that’s where she was given her first job as a cryptanalyst by William Friedman in 1937 or 1938. There was a big expansion in the Signal Intelligence and Friedman was looking to recruit individuals to work there. Friedman offered Wilma $1620 while she was making about $1440. She had to put her name on a sign-in sheet and she was 19 on the list. Wilma was ecstatic about this opportunity, more so, because her William Friedman and his wife were the major driving force of her cryptology interest. In March 1941, she was first assigned to work with Dr. Abe Sinkov on breaking the Italian diplomatic codes. The Italians invented their own encryption machines, US codenamed as the Japanese Purple Machines, which were improvements of the German Enigma machine.Perez, Alberto. \\"How the U.S. Cracked Japan’s Purple Encryption Machine at the Dawn of World War II\\", 22 March February 2013.

They were responsible for getting the messages, organizing it, recording it, filing it, and deciphering the messages. In July 1942, she was assigned to “Department A” which was responsible for working on code messages from the Japanese Army. William Friedman initially worked on breaking the Japanese codes. In two years working in Department A, she was put in charge of the unit whose duty was to analyze and interpret the addresses which were linked to the messages of the Japanese military. One of the main goals of deciphering the Japanese messages was to figure out the Japanese Order of Battle.

Located in the upper part of the city, the cathedral was built on the hill of Ambohimanoro, near the Andohalo square, and has now been designated as a national heritage by the Malagasy government. It is one of the first permanent Anglican churches built on the island. History During the reign of Ranavalona I Christians in Madagascar were persecuted and church building suppressed. However, in the succeeding monarchs' reigns, European influence grew and the suppression of Christians was relaxed, with many missionaries, most notably those belonging to the London Missionary Society being invited back in. A turning point in the history of Christianity in Madagascar happened when queen Ranavalona II who had been in part raised by European tutors converted to Christianity. During this time period Anglican missionaries from the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel were sent to Madagascar. Several years later the first Anglican bishop Kestell Kestell- Cornish was sent to Madagascar. He resided near Ambohimanoro where his congregation met in a small wooden church at Ambatomasina, near the cathedral's current location. Eventually he was given permission to build a permanent building. Assisted by the bishop, the first stone was laid in 1883 by then prime minister Rainilaiarivony. The church was designed by English architect William White and built by Norwegian Alfred Anker in the neo-Gothic style. Since its completion in 1889, several renovations have taken place, most notably the replacement of the stained glass windows that have been imported from England as well as the replacement of the roof tiles. In October 2017 Princess Anne attended a Service of Thanksgiving to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Diplomatic relationship between Madagascar and the United Kingdom at the cathedral, alongside Madagascar president Hery Rajaonarimampianina during her visit to the country, making it the highest ranked member of the British royal family to officially visit the location.

He made his debut in May, 2013 and wrestles for Shikoroyama stable. He reached the top makuuchi division in January 2018 and has two special prizes for Fighting Spirit and two gold stars for yokozuna upsets. His highest rank has been komusubi. Early life and sumo experience Kōsuke Horikiri was born as the youngest of four children, born into a family that ran a construction company. He was a head taller than most of his classmates as a student. Unlike other members of his family, he was not inclined towards sports as he was somewhat overweight and didn't like running. He tried judo, but found he excelled more at sumo; taking the children's sumo championship in his city in both his first and second years of primary school. Though he was skilled at sumo, he didn't like the sport at first, especially practice, and would often try to avoid it. As the sumo at the city level was not challenging enough he began participating in national children's sumo tournaments but achieved little success. He did not see sumo in his future but as most of his friends were involved in the sport, he continued. Having a very gregarious nature, he made friends quickly at tournaments, among them being future makuuchi wrestlers Daieishō and Hokutōfuji.『相撲』2018年3月号 p.14-15 In junior high school Horikiri began to find sumo more appealing, placing well in tournaments. This culminated in taking 3rd place in the national junior high school sumo tournament in Kagoshima. Horikiri recalled being so certain he would be eliminated on the first day, that he brought a swimsuit for swimming in the nearby sea so he would have something to do for the rest of the tournament. He transferred to Nagareyama High School and joined the sumo club. One of his classmates there was future Daishōhō. He was successful at the high school level, often placing in the best sixteen. In his 3rd year of high school, he placed 3rd in the 61st Towada Sumo Tournament in the individual category, losing to the future san'yaku wrestler Ichinojō. His family hoped he would go on to university and continue sumo there, but Horikiri instead expressed interest in taking over the family business. Not long afterwards, without consulting his parents he made the decision to enter Shikoroyama stable because his sumo coach was close with its head, the former Terao. His parents had not expected this sudden change and were reluctant to meet with his coach at first, but Horikiri convinced them of his fervor. Career In his first tournament in July 2013 he achieved a 6–1 record, losing only to Ikeru (who himself was also in his debut and went on to win the jonokuchi championship). In the following tournament in September, in the jonidan division, he had a 7–0 record, and took the championship, beating Aokishin in a playoff. In the next tournament, which was his sandanme debut, he only achieved a 4–3 but following that in January 2014 he got another perfect record and took the sandanme division championship. Over the next year, he posted four winning tournaments out of six. He was promoted to the salaried ranks of jūryō for the March 2015 tournament along with Amakaze and Ishiura. On this promotion, he chose the shikona of Abi which was the idea of his coach the aforementioned former sekiwake Terao. Abi was pronounced the same as Shikoroyama coach's nickname. The characters used were chosen in the hope that Horikiri could be strong like the many armed Asura (of which the first character is the same as in Abi's first character) and \\"on fire\\" in the ring (the second character means \\"flaming\\").Abi, Amakaze, and Ishiura jūryō debut Nikkan Sports 2015-1-28 Though he lasted four tournaments in the division, he only managed one winning tournament and was demoted back to makushita after the September 2015 tournament. He spent the next eight tournaments moving up and down the top third of the makushita division. In the March 2017 tournament at makushita 16 he got a 7–0 record and took the championship. He would follow this with a strong 5-2 in May, which would finally garner re-promotion to jūryō in July 2017, in which he achieved a winning tournament (8–7). In the next tournament in September at jūryō 11 he posted a 10–5 record and on the final day beat both Homarefuji and Kotoyuki in a playoff to take the championship. An 11–4 record at jūryō 5 in November would propel him to the top flight makuuchi division for the first time. In his debut in January 2018 at maegashira 14 he had a record of 10–5 and earned the Fighting Spirit Prize along with Ryūden. Another 10-5 for the March 2018 tournament saw him promoted to maegashira 2 for the May tournament, where he recorded only seven wins but earned his first kinboshi by defeating the yokozuna Hakuhō on day 6. He won his second kinboshi in consecutive tournaments in July 2018 with a victory over Kakuryū on Day 5. In May 2019 he won ten bouts and shared the Fighting Spirit prize with tournament winner Asanoyama and top division debutant Shimanoumi. Abi clinched the prize on the final day by defeating Tamawashi, and said he was inspired by Asanoyama, who is the same age. This performance earned him promotion to the sanyaku ranks for the first time at komusubi. He followed up with 8–7 and 9–6 records in the next two tournaments but did not get promoted to sekiwake as there were no openings at that rank (with it being filled by Mitakeumi and the demoted ōzeki Takakeishō in September and Tochinoshin in November). He was reprimanded by the Japan Sumo Association in November 2019 after he posted an image on Instagram of his friend and fellow wrestler Wakamotoharu tied up and gagged with tape as a prank. It was deemed inappropriate and Abi and Wakamotoharu apologized in person to JSA chairman Hakkaku and the board for the incident. The JSA has advised wrestlers not to post on their individual social media in future, although accounts run by the stables are not affected. In the following November tournament in Kyushu he produced another 9–6 record from the rank of komusubi East. He was ranked at komusubi on the January 2020 banzuke for the fourth tournament in a row; the first time this has happened since Kisenosato spent four straight tournaments at komusubi from July 2006 until January 2007. In February 2020 he was reprimanded again after he told reporters, unprompted, that he had slept through a workshop organized by the Sumo Association to explain the changes to their social media policy that he had instigated. He was withdrawn by his stablemaster partway through the July 2020 tournament after he admitted to twice visiting a hostess bar with a low- ranking wrestler from another stable, against the guidance on nonessential travel given by the Sumo Association to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The Sumo Association chairman Hakkaku called his actions \\"unpardonable.\\" Abi submitted a retirement notice through his stablemaster on August 4, which was not immediately accepted. Later that week, the Sumo Association suspended Abi for three tournaments and reduced his pay and that of his stablemaster while rejecting his resignation. It emerged that he had gone out several more times than the two occasions to which he had admitted. Despite having recently got married, he was told to move back into his stable and be under strict supervision. His retirement papers are being kept on file by the Sumo Association and will be activated if there are any further transgressions. Family Abi was married in June 2020 after a three year relationship. They have one daughter. Fighting style Abi is a tsuki/oshi specialist, meaning he prefers to slap and push his opponents rather than fighting on the mawashi or belt. His most common winning kimarite are oshi- dashi (push out), hataki-komi (slap down) and tsuki-dashi (thrust out).

Volunteers serve plates of homemade spaghetti to low income and homeless guests at Blanchet House of Hospitality in Portland, Oregon.  History  In the early 1940s, a group of University of Portland students started a fraternity called the Blanchet Club. The club took their name from Oregon’s first pioneer Catholic priest, Rev. Francis Norbert Blanchet. The students were encouraged by their club chaplain to “Do something meaningful” so they began doing acts of charity like serving sandwiches and coffee out of the back of a car to those experiencing homelessness and food insecurity. The founders believed that everyone in the world has a right to food, clothing, and shelter. They wanted to provide the poor, sick, homeless and unwanted people of Portland a place of immediate relief with no moral judgments or religious requirements. The men wanted to have a larger impact on the community, so they began searching for a permanent location to serve meals from. In 1952, the Blanchet Club was able to rent the bottom floor of the building next door for their House of Hospitality. On Feb. 11, the group served its first meal to 227 people. 66 years later, Blanchet House now serve three meals a day, six days a week to on average 1,000 people a day. It is a house of hospitality, inspired by the Catholic Worker’s Movement. Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin created the Catholic Worker newspaper and then opened up houses of hospitality and farms. People across America, like the founders of Blanchet House, were so inspired by their activism that they started their own Catholic Worker communities, each one independent from each other. Now, the Catholic Worker movement can be seen as a dialogue between Catholic social teaching and radical Christian anarchism. In 1962, a farm in Carlton, Oregon was purchased by Blanchet House which hosts a residential program for men who are rebuilding their lives from drug and alcohol addiction, job loss and other obstacles. In 2010, Blanchet House received city approval to construct a new facility at the former site of the Dirty Duck https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bds/article/290505 which opened in 2012. Blanchet House celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2012 by honoring supporters like Tracy Oseran, founder of Urban Gleaners and Portland City Commissioner Nick Fish who helped secure the site for their new building.https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2012/03/blanchet_house_supporters_cele.html  Programs  = Free meals program = Blanchet House serves nutritious meals in their Founders Cafe to anyone in need. Their public cafe is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner, Monday to Saturday. All are welcome. No questions asked. Blanchet House can serve up to 1,000 meals a day. = Impact = In 2019, over 325,000 plates of food were served to the hungry in the Old Town part of downtown Portland. 175 men were provided with life-changing housing, clothing, support, and basic needs through Blanchet House's residential program. As well as 400,000 lbs of fresh food were rescued from different vendors throughout the city, such as Trader Joe's, the convention center, and Whole Foods. = Sustainability and Green Initiatives = Blanchet House is committed to creating as little food waste as possible. Blanchet House has different partnerships throughout the city to rescue their unused food. One of the most popular days for meal guests is on Saturday for Blanchet's pizza day. Unused slices from popular pizza places are collected and redistributed. Blanchet House is unique amongst public kitchens in that it has nearly zero food waste. Blanchet sends its own leftover food waste to two different farms in the area including its own, Blanchet Farm. The food waste is turned into slop for pigs and other farm animals. Blanchet's building itself is Leed Platinum Certified. The roof of the building serves as a green roof. Every time it rains, the water is collected and filtered through the roof and used as greywater throughout the building. = Residential housing program = In addition to Blanchet House's free meal program, they operate a transitional living program for men at two different locations. The downtown location houses up to 55 men living here at any given time. In exchange for room, board and case management they volunteer to prepare and serve food for the free meal service. The men living at Blanchet House are working to rebuild their lives after struggling with homelessness, addiction, job loss and other issues. Unlike the low-barrier meal service where anyone is welcome, the residential program is high barrier. Men must be sober during their time at Blanchet House. The second location is out at a farm located in Carlton, Oregon. The founders wanted a second location away from the temptations of the city, so that men could fully focus on their recovery. 22 men live on the farm where they do meaningful work like caring for animals, woodworking, gardening and support each other in rebuilding their lives from addiction. Items from the wood shop are sold at different stores in downtown Portland that feature local craftsmen. = Volunteer = Blanchet House would not be able to carry out their mission without its set of dedicated volunteers. Each meal service requires 12 volunteers per shift. Volunteers help with plating the food, serving meals to the guests restaurant style, and cleaning the tables after guests leave. Cooperate groups and schools (such as Kaiser Permamente, Wells Fargo, Jesuit High School, and Central Catholic) are the most frequented volunteers, but individuals can sign up online.

He currently maintains a studio and exhibits in New York City. He previously served as art department chair for several major universities, and remains professor emeritus of painting at Cornell University Department of Art.  Early life  Kord was born Victor George Katz in Satu Mare, Romania. The family immigrated to Canada to avoid the threat of war in 1938. They moved to Ukiah, California in 1943 and the family name changed to Kord. They subsequently moved to Cleveland, Ohio in 1945. Kord graduated from the Cleveland Institute of Art in 1957 where he studied with Louis Bosa, was friends with Julian Stanczak and was mentored by Richard Anuszkiewicz. He then studied at Yale School of Art with Joseph Albers and James Brooks, receiving a Bachelor of Fine Art in 1958 and a Master of Fine Art in 1960. Career = Educator = Kord taught painting at four different universities beginning as instructor at the Department of Art, University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, from 1960–1965, where he taught watercolor to architects and drawing and design to art students. From 1965–1981, he served as professor of painting at the Department of Art, University of Wisconsin–Madison, taking the position of chair between 1979–1981. He taught painting to undergraduate and graduates and introduced the course based on Alber's method of color interaction. He moved to Richmond, Virginia to become chair and professor at the Department of Painting and Printmaking at Virginia Commonwealth University, from 1981 through 1987. His final professorship began in 1987 at Cornell University's Department of Art in Ithaca, New York. He continued as department chair until 1993 and retired Professor Emeritus in 2005. Rosy Keyser, a New York artist who studied with Kord at Cornell, said that \\"his work exemplified the freedom to attribute abstract ideas to firmly planted materials.\\" He helped to sponsor many visiting artists to art departments. Richard Artschwager, an early collaborator and lifelong friend, included Kord in the catalogue of his Whitney Museum retrospective. In a conceptual work shown at William Wegman's 2015 Brooklyn Museum retrospective, Kord appeared in Five Figures at Six Feet, 1969. In 2019 Kord was invited to participate on the \\"Longevity to Legacy Panel\\" at the annual College Art Association conference. = Painter = In 1971 early in his career, Kord was included in the exhibition \\"Lyrical Abstraction\\" curated by Larry Aldrich at the Aldrich Museum in Ridgefield, Connecticut. The exhibition was shown again at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City to note Lyrical Abstraction as a trend in abstraction away from minimal and hard-edge to a softer, more sensuous form of painting. Aldrich said about the American lyrical artists he discovered, \\"The artist's touch is always visible in this type of painting, even when the paintings are done with spray guns, sponges or other objects.\\" Carter Ratcliffe considered the Lyrical Abstraction movement to be revisionist, or in his words, \\"The happy dazzle of their colors could looked pedantic. . . (however) a few tagged with this label - John Torreano, Victor Kord, Philip Wofford, John Seery - turned out to be good painters.\\" Much of Kord's painting practice was during his academic appointments. In 1967 he received a faculty fellowship from the University of Wisconsin to work in Paris where he exhibited at Galerie Mathias-Fels. From 1970 to 1973 he took a leave of absence from the University of Wisconsin in order to live and work in New York City. In 1970 he had a solo exhibition in Koln, Germany at Galerie Rolfe Ricke. The next year he was represented by French & Company Gallery and participated in a group exhibition at Andre Emmerich Gallery, both New York City galleries. It was at that point that he became associated with the Lyrical Abstraction group. Other group exhibitions included New American Abstract Paintings that in 1972 was presented by Vassar College Art Gallery in Poughkeepsie, NY. The exhibition catalogue's introduction mirrors the painterly approach of the Lyrical Abstract movement. \\". . .the emphasis placed by artists in this exhibition on textural values is contrasted with the hard, flat, seemingly de-physicalized surfaces which are characteristic of so much recent art.\\" In 1977 Walker Art Center presented Invitation '77: Ten Painters which featured paintings, drawings, and collages from midwest region artists. It was curated by Lisa Lyons. As an active member of the artist group American Abstract Artists, Kord participated in many group shows. In 2011 Ivan Karp of OK Harris Gallery curated and presented better and lesser known artists of this group in an exceptionally spacious and well considered exhibition. Along with David Reed and Don Voisine, Barbara A. MacAdam said in ARTnews that \\"Voisine's thin, vertical Debutante Twist (2009) and Victor Kord's Avon IV (2009), hanging side by side, set off a thoughtful contrast between almost-edgy and almost-lyrical. Kord's painting expresses the interaction between the rational and the poetic, with a rhythmic cursive frieze playing against a soft pattern.\\" The most definitive of the American Abstract Artist group exhibitions was The Onward of Art: Abstract Artist's 80th Anniversary which took place in 2016 to showcase the vigor and relevance of abstraction in twenty first century America. Its catalogue revisits the organization's extensive history of such well known abstractionists as Mondrian and Albers and places current members within the context, of an abstraction that communicates directly through the eye to reach our intellect and our emotions without words. Kord's solo exhibitions with the June Kelly Gallery in New York City began in 2008. They include Algorithm and Blues, 2008, with an accompanying essay by Eleanor Heartney, Hiding in Plain Sight, 2011, Cut-Out: New Paintings, 2014, Anonymous Collaborations, 2016, Making Ends Meet: New Works, 2019. A selection of his works is also viewable online at the Artist's Viewing Program of the Drawing Center. Kord was also active locally in university art communities where he often curated exhibitions of other artists. At the Madison Art Center, Madison, Wisconsin he presented Recent Works on Paper by American Artists: Victor Kord and Joseph Wilfer, catalogue.  Awards and Collections  In 1962 Victor Kord received the Guggenheim fellowship, one of the youngest at 26 to receive the award. He maintained a studio at the American Center in Paris, France where he met the critic Max Kozloff, and artists Irving Petlin, Leon Golub, Nancy Spero, Seymour Rosofsky and Pater Saul. Examples of Kord's art are held in the permanent collections of Ellen Noёl Art Museum, the Cleveland Museum of Art, and Whitney Museum of American Art, Chazen Museum of Art, and Madison Museum of Contemporary Art.

Background  By this stage in the Korean War the frontline had been consolidated with fortifications, and there was not much movement. Rather like World War One, strategic objectives would be hills or specific areas of land, rather than sweeping objectives or pushes. By September 1950, Australian and Canadian forces, as part of the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade left the area, and were replaced by the British 29th Infantry Brigade Group, then followed by the 28th British Commonwealth Brigade in April 1951. The 25th Canadian Infantry Brigade was the last to arrive and reinforce the area. The units were then all formed into the 1st Commonwealth Division. In October 1951, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) had made efforts to attack and take the hill at the First Battle of Maryang-san. PVA forces were pushed back and defeated by Australian forces.  Action  The PVA first launched a large scale bombardment of the area, including rockets, on the night of 5 November. The barrage lasted 15 hours. The barrage was then followed up by a human wave attack of massed PVA troops, and the British were overrun. Some troops established a fighting withdrawal, and PVA troops captured the hill, taking British prisoners. The hill was defended by 400 British troops, but attacked by three battalions. Private Bill Speakman was awarded Britain's Victoria Cross at this battle for his bravery. Speakman had been conveying a supply of grenades to the British troops, on the left hand side of the hill. When the PVA attacked, Speakman took it on his own initiative to gather 6 men, and then began throwing grenades at the PVA. He engaged the enemy with grenades and guns, making repeated charges against them in different directions. When the men ran out of grenades, they began throwing bottles and metal tea pots from the kitchen supply. This gave time for his unit to withdraw. Even while wounded in the leg, he continued to charge at the PVA.

He was Honored Worker of Science and Technology of the RSFSR (1944) and laureate of Stalin Prize of II degree (1946).  Biography  Sergei Osipovich Mayzel was born on in St. Petersburg in the family of doctor Osip (Joseph) Isayevich Mayzel (1855–1913), a graduate of Imperial Medico-Surgical Academy of 1881. Sergey's mother, Sofya Efremovna Antik, died on December 25, 1882, 10 days after his birth, due to childbirth complications. Mayzel was a Hereditary honorary citizen. In 1906 he graduated from St. Petersburg University and trained at the University of Göttingen in 1909. In 1906–1930 he worked as a mining engineer at the St. Petersburg Mining Institute. In 1908–1918 he simultaneously taught at Higher Women's Courses. Professor since 1911, he had the rank of Court councillor. Since 1920, he worked part-time at the State Optical Institute. In 1930–1952 he worked in Moscow in the All-Union Electrotechnical Institute (since 1951 it was called Research Institute of Light Engineering, VNISI). In 1932 he began working at Moscow Power Engineering Institute (MPEI) and directed its Lighting Engineering Department. He was Doctor of Technical Sciences (1938) and a member of the CPSU(b) since 1947. Sergei Mayzel died on July 5, 1955 in Moscow. = Family = Sergey Osipovich Mayzel had two sons: * Boris Mayzel (1907―1987), a composer. * Evgeni Mayzel (1912―1944, died in World War II). He was a specialist in aerial photography, in 1935―1939 he was married to a methodologist in rhythmic gymnastics and dancer Mariana Janovna Shpilrein (Rodionova in her second marriage), the daughter of a mathematician and electromechanic Jan Shpilrein. = Scientific work = His main works are devoted to the physical basics of construction of light quantities, the basics of colorimetry, the problems of blackout, the methods of light measurements, the normalization of lighting for various types of work, and the development of new sources of light. He developed the theory of color vision. He participated in solving the issues of light coverage of the Hermitage, State Tretyakov Gallery, several Moscow Metro stations, Kremlin stars, Lenin Mausoleum, and various other objects. He presented critics of the definition of the luminous flux as the power of emanation estimated by visual sensation; the physical definition he proposed was internationally recognized. The new \\"equivalent brightness\\" value proposed by him for the estimation of small brightness photometry was included in the system of basic photometric magnitudes (1963), and then in the International Lighting Technical Dictionary. He wrote articles for magazines \\"Electricity\\", \\"Lighting Engineering\\" (and was a member of the editorial board). Overall Mayzel played a leading role in the creation of the Soviet lighting engineering school. References  Literature  * С. О. Майзель.

Ankara, 1970) is a visual artist based in Istanbul. She uses photography, installation, and printed matter to explore the classification, appropriation and distribution of data and knowledge. Her work deals with listings, collections, rearrangements, and archives. Cennetoğlu co- represented Turkey at the 53rd International Venice Biennale with Ahmet Öğüt in 2009. Her work has been shown at numerous international institutions such as Kunsthalle Wien, Vienna (2020); Ständehaus, Kunstsammlung Nordrhein- Westfallen, Düsseldorf (2019); SculptureCenter, New York (2019); Liverpool Biennial, Liverpool (2018), Chisenhale Gallery, London (2018); documenta14, Athens and Kassel (2017); Bonner Kunstverein, Bonn (2015); Kunsthalle Basel, Basel (2011); Gwangju Biennale, Gwangju (2014), Manifesta 8, Murcia (2010); Walker Art Center (2007); Istanbul Biennial (2007); and Berlin Biennial (2003). She is the founding director of BAS (2006–ongoing), an Istanbul-based artist-run initiative that collects and displays artists’ books and printed material as artwork. In Turkey, she is \\"best known as an apostle of the artist’s book.\\"  Education  Cennetoğlu received a BA in psychology and then studied photography in Paris. From 1996 to 2002, she lived in New York where she worked on documentary and fashion photography for publications such as Purple and Self Service. In 2002, she moved to Amsterdam where she studied a.o. at the Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten and got involved with artists' books. In 2005, she moved back to Turkey. In 2016, she was a guest at the DAAD Artists-in-Berlin Program.  Selected Works  = The List, 2007–ongoing = Since 2007, Cennetoğlu has been developing The List in collaboration with UNITED for Intercultural Action, an Amsterdam-based network in support of migrants and refugees. The work is a collection of data about thousands of immigrants, asylum seekers, and refugees who lost their lives on their way to or at the border of the European Union since 1993. It is presented in multiple forms, including posters, billboards, newspaper supplements, and public screens, in various cities, including Amsterdam, Athens, Basel, Istanbul, Sofia, Bonn, Milano, Los Angeles, Berlin, London, and Liverpool.The List featured data about 7,128 individuals when first exhibited in Amsterdam in 2007. As of May 2018, it includes 34,361 cases. Cennetoğlu does not consider the project \\"an art piece\\"; she does not edition it, sell it or sign it. Although she doesn't consider this project an artwork, she acknowledges a connection between The List and her artistic practice, as her artworks deal with witness-bearing. This work exemplifies how Cennetoğlu assumes different positions such as caretaker and a facilitator—not only an author—when she deals with lists and archives. > \\"Governments don’t keep these record for the public; they don’t want the > public to see these records because it exposes their policies, so you have > NGOs trying to put data together, and that data is incomplete and fragile, > but there again someone has to do it.

Subsequently, it was exhibited in the form of posters at Great George Street in Liverpool as part of the Liverpool Biennial 2018 and in conjunction with Cennetoğlu’s solo exhibition at Chisenhale Gallery, London. On August 1, 2018, the posters in Liverpool were anonymously destroyed and removed. Some suggested that a council worker may have mistaken the work as an illegal poster and taken it down, but a spokesperson from the city council refused the allegation. The work was reinstalled on August 5, 2018, but was vandalised again shortly afterwards. = Catalog 2009, 2009 = As part of Lapses, the two-artist exhibition (with Ahmet Öğüt) curated by Başak Şenova for the Pavilion of Turkey at the 53rd International Venice Biennale, Cennetoğlu produced CATALOG 2009 (2009), a book that mimics the format of a mail-order catalog, comprising 450 photographs organized in fifteen categories inspired by stock photography: composition, color, assumption, negotiation, operation, vanity, adjustment, excursion, caution, love, seizure, exploit, act, invasion and replacement. Cennetoğlu created subjective categories to organize her photographs along with a few found photographs, challenging the assumed hierarchies of value. For the duration of the exhibition in Venice, the viewers were encouraged to order and download the featured photographs from the Internet free or charge. = 04.09.2014, 2014 = In the early 2010s, Cennetoğlu started creating bound collections of daily newspapers printed in one day and has produced different editions of this work in several countries, including Turkey, Switzerland, and Germany. The work offers a juxtaposition of information in an unconventional way, and questions the politics of representation through print media. The artist calls it a \\"re-contextualization\\" of the newspaper and \\"an almost monumentalization\\" as the archiving of printed matter is meant to be temporary. = Gurbet's Diary, 2017 = Commissioned by documenta14, Gurbet’s Diary is a work that comprises 82,661 words in mirror image placed on 145 press-ready lithographic limestone slabs. It draws from Gurbet's Diary. I Engraved My Heart into the Mountains by Gurbetelli Ersöz, first published in 1998 by Mezopotamien Verlag, Neuss. Ersöz was a chemist turned editor turned guerrilla—a Kurdish fighter who kept a journal as an act of resistance between 1995–97. In her diary, she writes about her experience as a fighter as well as her observations in nature, poetry she likes, and the difference between being an intellectual and a fighter. She was killed in 1997. As part of the exhibition in Kassel, Cennetoğlu also created a related work, replacing the usual inscription of \\"Museum Fridericianum\\" with \\"Being safe is scary\\"—as a tribute to Ersöz. = 1 January 1970 – 21 March 2018 · H O W B E I T · Guilty feet have got no rhythm · Keçiboynuzu · AS IS · MurMur · I measure every grief I meet · Taq u Raq · A piercing Comfort it affords · Stitch · Made in Fall · Yes.

The film features all the photographs and videos the artist took, the images she received on his phone and email, all of her video works, their documentation, exhibitions, as well as images from her private life. Considered as an act of \\"vulnerability and rebelliousness\\", the work is an investigation of collective histories through the images the artist has collected over 12 years. The title was inspired by Clarice Lispector's The Hour of the Star, a novel with thirteen subtitles separated by or's.  Exhibitions  Selected group exhibitions include Kunsthalle Wien, Vienna (2020); Ständehaus, Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfallen, Düsseldorf (2019); Liverpool Biennial, Liverpool (2018); Stories of Almost Everyone, Hammer Museum, Los Angeles (2018); 3rd Berlin Herbstsalon, Maxim Gorki Theater, Berlin (2017); documenta14, Athens and Kassel (2017); It is Obvious from the Map, Redcat, Los Angeles (2017); The Restless Earth, Fondazione Nicola Trussardi, Milan (2017); … und eine Welt noch, Kunsthaus Hamburg, Hamburg (2016); Burning Down The House, 10th Gwangju Bienniale, Gwangju (2014); Frozen Lakes, Artist’s Space, New York (2013); Manifesta 8, Murcia (2010); The Pavilion of Turkey at the 53rd Venice Biennale (2009); 3rd Berlin Biennale (2008); 1st Athens Biennale (2007); and 10th Istanbul Biennale (2007). The artist is represented by Rodeo Gallery, based in London and Piraeus.  Artist-run initiative  In 2006, Cennetoğlu initiated an artist-run project called BAS, which roughly translates as \\"print\\". The space currently hosts a collection of artists' books and ephemera on permanent display, which has grown from her own collection. The collection comprises three main categories: artists' publications, periodicals, and project publications with an online inventory. The artists' books in the collection are produced in large editions and circulate outside of mainstream art channels. This can be considered as an extension of her artistic research on the collection, organization, and dissemination of information. Alongside BAS, Cennetoğlu collaborated with artist Philippine Hoegen to establish Bent, the publishing project that focused on commissioning artists' books by artists from Turkey. The first publication was Pavement Myth-The Life of the Pavement’s Wolf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) by Masist Gül, followed by artists' books Takip/Poursuite (2006) by Aslı Çavuşoğlu, Bent003 by Emre Hüner, Sahil Sahnesi Sesi (2008) Cevdet Erek, KILAVUZ (2009) by the artist collective Atılkunst, among others. BAS also hosted exhibitions, including Masist Gül (2011); Artists' books from Georgia and BAS Collection (2011); KORIDOR 1988–1995 (2010); Artists' books by Sol LeWitt (2009), and more. To develop the BAS Collection, Cennetoğlu prioritizes diversity over personal taste as she has an open acquisition policy when buying, accepting, and bartering artists' books. The collection is open to the public. In 2014, collectorspace, an Istanbul- based nonprofit, collaborated with Cennetoğlu and the BAS Collection to work on an exhibition with a newspaper project borrowed from the collection, titled Corrections and Clarifications (2001–ongoing) by artist Anita Di Bianco.

She wears the Group 2000 armband with a coat of arms and the group name. Painting by Max Nauta, dated August 1945. Group 2000 () was a Dutch resistance group during the Second World War in the Amsterdam area and remained virtually unknown for 70 years.Neerlandsch Verzetsmonument: List with names and other information of members of Group 2000 The Group was founded in 1940 and was led by Ms. Jacoba van Tongeren during the entire war.Marjan Schwegman (2016), The weapons of the resistance, farewell lecture on 18 February 2016, NIOD, pp 19/20 For the duration of the Second World War she provided food coupons for around 4,500 people in hiding. Group 2000 had more than 140 members who, together with the people in hiding, remained invisible during the war, and also afterwards, through the use of 4-number codenames. This changed only in 2015, after the book ‘Jacoba van Tongeren and the unknown resistance heroes of Group 200’ was published.Paul van Tongeren and Trudy Admiraal (2015), Jacoba van Tongeren and the unknown resistance heroes of Group 2000 (1940-1945), Publisher: Aspekt B.V.,  Origin  The founder of Group 2000, Jacoba van Tongeren, was an ecclesiastical social worker of the Dutch Reformed Church. Born in 1903, she was educated since her childhood in discipline and secrecy by her father Hermannus van Tongeren, a high officer in the Dutch colonial army (KNIL). Immediately after the capitulation in May 1940 he involved her in his first resistance activities. At the same time she was approached by the co-founders of the illegal magazine Vrij Nederland, Jan van der Neut and Frans Hofker. They started setting up the resistance newspaper, supported materially and financially by Hermannus van Tongeren, who also helped with the contacts of the Freemasons. At the request of the Reformed Church, Jacoba van Tongeren became social worker in charge of maintaining contact with the resistance. Her contact with the Amsterdam Church Council was Dr. Bernard Aris. Through her position she could travel freely through the country and she laid a nationwide network of contacts. This led to the resistance group becoming a national network from the beginning. In the Spring of 1941, dozens of members from, among others, Vrij Nederland were arrested. ‘Free the Netherlands’ and the resistance group split up and went their own way. Free the Netherlands as resistance newspaper Vrij Nederland and Group 2000 through helping people in hiding. Jacoba van Tongeren herself also went into hiding and came to the conclusion that all members of the Group should know as little as possible about each other and that the Group should no longer use real names, as her father always had held up. Based on what her father had taught her about intelligence years before, she developed a code system. From now on, every Group 2000 member was only referred to by a code number. This coding is the reason that during the entire World War II the group and all 4500 people in hiding were never unmasked. In March 1945, the Germans occupied the Group's headquarters and found thousands of coded names and addresses. However, they could not crack the code and the resistance fighters and people in hiding remained safe. Due to the code, members were anonymous during the war, but also afterwards: no one knew who was who.  Group activities and departments  The management of Group 2000 was formed by the Management Committee consisting of Ab Abas, Frits van Meer and Jacoba van Tongeren as executive manager. The Daily Board existed in 1944 of Harry Mouthaan, Kees Reitema and Jacoba van Tongeren. Each member was given his own task according to his position and was only accountable to Jacoba van Tongeren. In mid-1941, the Group was formed to help the growing number of people in hiding: Jews hiding in order to escape deportation, people who opposed the persecution of the Jews and the German domination, and men who evaded forced labor in Germany. For these people, hiding places had to be found every month. For this, use was made of the large ecclesiastical network that Jacoba had set up and the many contacts with the Freemasons. For all people in hiding, food coupons were needed, which were obtained in various ways: at the distribution offices themselves and by robbery at distribution offices. A brigadier of police managed the food coupons depot and used his position to acquire extra coupons. Several others took care of the distribution of the coupons, bringing them to Amsterdam areas. Part of the transport of these coupons were taken care of by Jacoba van Tongeren. She had a special ‘coupon vest’ in which 5,000 coupons could be transported, which gave her the title 'The Queen of Coupons' (De Bonnenkoninging). Others still brought food packages to the Jews in the prisoner camps of Vught, Westerbork, Bergen-Belsen, or to persons in hiding. Among them is Truus Wijsmuller, who personally arranged to help 600 Jewish children escape Austria in 1938, and 500 of them continuing their journey to England. People in hiding also needed identification cards, and another department of Group 2000 provided these. They managed the registration of those in need of IDs, the production, distribution. One member, Gerrit Jan van der Veen, known by his code name ‘2200’, later controlled the Personal Identity Center that created about 80,000 identity cards. In addition, the Group organized many more activities to carry out the resistance work. Crucial tasks were the so-called ‘district- work’, the Red Cross department, and providing security. The district-work took care of the delicate and efficient communication and coupon distribution from centralised places to local neighbourhoods. The local Red Cross department was led by one doctor, the first aid and medical care by another one, and there were 16 more doctors and nurses involved. The Group counted a dozen couriers, as well as drivers for food transport. Security was the responsibility of guards, who overlooked hauling of food and goods, and provided 24/7 security at food depots. A combat team of about 10 members was responsible for more proactive, armed resistance. Group 2000 also secured a place for the Marine Transmission Station, an important strategic asset to receive messages from England and distribute the news all over the Netherlands. Ministers offered spiritual and moral support to the resistance fighters and people in hiding. Group 2000 was represented at the highest level of the resistance: the national Council of Resistance. The activities cost more and more money. Hermannus van Tongeren already provided a large sum in 1940 from the Freemasons. Isaac Troostwijk continued this support in the middle of 1942. Of these 600,000 guilders (the equivalent of about 4 million euros in 2015), Group 2000 funded many of its own activities, and provided substantial start-up subsidies for other organisations like Vrij Nederland, the Personal Identity Center and the National Support Fund.  The Group and its members  The Group was supported by the Order of Freemasons, and counted about ten Freemasons among its members. Another supporter was the Dutch Reformed Church. A lot of members belonged to this church, and of more than ten ministers in the Group, most were Reformed. There were ten Jewish members. More than ten members and employees had made great efforts to aid Jewish people in hiding and later received the Yad Vashem medal. The Group counted men and women of all ages, roughly in the proportion of men:women as 5:3. One finds a great diversity of professions: from fur trimster and glass blower to banker and sculptor. Many of the Group members practiced their profession during the war, visible to the occupier. But in the meantime they performed invisible resistance work. By the end of the war, 18 Group members were murdered by the Nazis.  Relative obscurity of Group 2000  There are several reasons why the group remained unknown to all except a few during the war and for 70 years after 1945. The most important reason is the secret code by which all members were known. The extense of the network and the individual identities of members were beyond the grasp of all those who were involved, except Jacoba van Tongeren and one assistant, the only ones who assigned and knew code names. The code proved extremely effective and useful during the war. It was also the reason that the group was not very visible after the war. The name “Group 2000” itself contributed further to this invisibility. Another reason is that Dutch historians who wrote about the Second World War considered ‘resistance’ to be primarily those activities that actively fought against the German occupiers and that disadvantaged them. Espionage, sabotage and fighting groups were considered to be part of that endeavour, but helping persons in hiding was not. The deeds of heroic, tough men was extensively documented, but much less so the work of female resistance fighters, who were messengers or did various other tasks like those of Group 2000. The role of women in resistance remained underexposed. Finally, the leader, Jacoba van Tongeren herself, was very modest and did not boast about the Group’s efforts during the war. In 1945, she only delivered a rather formal, factual report to the Dutch queen's consort, also General and supreme commander of the army, Prince Bernard of Lippe-Biesterfeld. What made things worse, is that van Tongeren became chronically ill and was tied to her bed during many of the remaining years of her life. Shortly before she died, in 1967, she wrote an extensive, deeply personal account of her ‘Memories’ to a pastor of a national radio station. But her report was filed and discovered only in 2013 by her cousin Paul van Tongeren. Quoting extensively from Jacoba’s ‘Memories’, he and Trudy Admiraal wrote the book ‘Jacoba van Tongeren en de onbekende verzetshelden van Groep 2000’, which appeared in 2015. For 70 years the Group had remained invisible. The publication lifted the veil of obscurity for the descendants of many Group members, who often knew only bits and pieces of the full story of their (great)grandfathers and – mothers, and for others who had an as yet incomplete picture of resistance in Amsterdam and many other parts of The Netherlands from 1940 to 1945.

The Revealed God (Latin: deus revelatus) in Christian theology is a term coined by Martin Luther which affirms that the ultimate self-revelation of God is in his hiddenness. It is the particular focus of Luther’s work the Heidelberg Theses of 1518, presented during the Heidelberg disputation of 1518. In Christian theology, God is presented as revealed or ‘deus revelatus’ through the suffering of Jesus Christ on the cross. Debate of the term is found in the field of ‘Philosophy of Religion,’ where it is contested among philosophers such as J. L. Schellenberg. The term is usually distinguished from Luther’s concept of ‘The Hidden God’ or ‘deus absconditus’ which proposes that God actively hides. It is accepted that God is invisible, however Luther posed God as an actively hiding who can use this hiding to reveal himself. This distinction which permeates his theology has been the subject of wide interpretation, leading to controversy between theologians who believe the terms to be either antithetical or identical. These two conflicting strands of thought present the main problem when interpreting Luther’s doctrine of the Revealed God. In recent years the term has been used to inform modern analysis of religious themes such as evolution.  The Revealed God  = Christian Theology = The conception of Luther's Revealed God came about through his own personal struggles with grasping assurance of God's grace, which he confirmed by looking to the Cross of Christ. The concept of the incomprehensibility of God was first introduced by Luther in his Lectures on The Psalms. The theology of ‘deus revelatus’ originated to address the concern that if a God exists, he has not made his existence sufficiently clear. The term ‘Revealed God’ can be found in Luther’s works, Heidelberg Theses (1518) and On the Bondage of the Will (1525). Luther’s theology was permeated by the theology of the cross, which led to the conception of both the Revealed God (deus revelatus) and the hidden God (deus absconditus). In the Heidelberg Thesis, Luther asserts the view of ‘deus revelatus', a living God who suffered on a cross, and in On the Bondage of the Will Luther depicts the ‘deus absconditus’, a God of hidden majesty. The Christian concept of God depicts an absolute being who is righteous in himself, thereby becoming a threat to unrighteous humans. Therefore, He must become 'the God who seeks to be justified by the unrighteous in his words, a great vulnerability in which God stoops low in order to give sinners faith'. The concept of the Revealed God was later referred to by Paulson as 'The Preached God'. The Revealed God is one being and three persons who 'actively wants to be found—in Christ, and him crucified—justified in his words'. Luther thus proposed that God’s ultimate self revelation is in hiddenness, ‘namely, in weakness, in folly, in the incarnation and on the cross’. The divine majesty and glory of God is ‘shame and humiliation’ as he ‘brings life by means of death, whose suffering leads to resurrection’, thus there becomes a paradox whereby God is hidden in His self-revelation. God is hidden ‘in the suffering, humility and shame of the cross’ and ones suffering on Earth, however through faith sinners can recognise the God of love and mercy revealed in Christ. Such a revelation which leads to justification nevertheless requires a preacher, thus 'The Holy Spirit sends such preachers so that grace is not so deeply hidden that we never find Christ hidden in the repulsive cross'. Because of this, Luther’s theology states that any individual outside of a Christian community of faith do not experience his self-revelation and do not know his attitude towards them. Luther believed that the visible aspects of God through his hiding were the only sufficient explanation of God. Therefore, Luther stated it was imperative that theologians focus on the cross to ‘see God as God wants to be seen’. ‘Those who seek to know the invisible things of God, namely, God's glory, majesty, wisdom, and justice, through the wisdom of natural revelation are chastised as theologians of glory by Luther’. The concept connects to free will within Christian theology as it leads to the belief that ‘God must remain hidden […] failing to do so would lead to a loss of morally significant freedom on the part of creatures’. = In the Bible = Luther’s conception of the Revealed God was derived from specific scripture in the Christian bible which detail how only through Christ does God choose to be revealed. Passages of significance include John 14:8-9, ‘8 Philip said, “Lord, show us the Father and that will be enough for us.” 9 Jesus answered: “Don’t you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, ‘Show us the Father’?’.  Further passages of importance:  * Exod 33:18-23 *Rom 1:19-25 * 1 Cor 1:17-31 *2 Thessalonians 2:4 = Philosophy of religion = The Revealed God contributes to debate in Philosophy of Religion whereby philosophers such as J. L. Schellenberg have used it to support the view of atheism. Schellenberg’s line of argument attempts to disprove the Judeo-Christian God by stating that were there a perfectly loving God, He would adequately reveal Himself to allow every person to attain personal relationship with Him. However, since ‘there are capable, inculpable non-believers […] there is no perfectly loving God’. Schellenberg’s Argument: # If there is a God, he is perfectly loving # If a perfectly loving God exists, reasonable nonbelief does not occur # Reasonable nonbelief does occur # No perfectly loving God exists # There is no God  Similar: 'The Hidden God'  A similar Lutheran concept is that of the Hidden God, a deity whose grace is hidden, which is often considered to be interconnected to the Revealed God. Luther’s depiction of ‘deus absconditus’ can be found in his work Bondage of the Will (De servo arbitrio). Luther’s concept asserts that the first instance of hiding in the Christian Bible occurred in the garden of Eden where Adam and Eve sought to hide from God. Following this instance, God has remained hidden in the sense that his will and counsels remain unknown to any except him. There are two contrasting views of the implications of Luther's depiction of a Hidden God: # His hiddenness is the subjective limit of human knowledge. # God is in essence mercy, so acts that appear evil can be attributed to the attribute of divine love.  Controversy  A prevalent issue in theological scholarship is the relationship between the Revealed God and the Hidden God. Controversy has arisen as to whether the ‘deus revelatus’ and ‘deus absconditus’ refer to two distinct strands of theology which only have the concept of hiddenness in common, or are identical in form. It is claimed that according to his own writings, 'Luther never preached two or three gods or powers; he was not a Manichaean or anti-Trinitarian', however a seeming paradox is contested. Gerrish forms two differing groups of theologians dependent on whether they believe the terms are antithetical or identical. Theologians who believe the terms are antithetical include Hendel, Theodosius Harnack, the two Ritschls, Reinhold Seeberg, Hirsch, Elert, and Holl. Such theologians argue the dualistic nature of the terms and state that the two differing views of God they produce cannot be reconciled. Hendel states ‘Luther warns that the theologian and believer must distinguish between the God preached, or revealed, and the God hidden, \\"that is, between the Word of God and God himself”’. Harnack’s work was considered to be a rediscovering of the concept of the Hidden and Revealed God whereby ‘the notion of hiddenness expresses a double relation of God to the world: outside of Christ he is the free, all- working, majestic God of the Law; in Christ he is the gracious Redeemer who has bound himself to his Word and Sacraments’. This position was also held by Althaus who stated that through his conception of the Revealed and Hidden God, Luther divided God; 'God, according to His secret will, to a great extent disagrees with His Word offering grace to all men'. Theologians who believe the terms are identical are Kattenbusch and Erich Seeberg. The theologians argue that a single event of revelation led people through faith to see the Revealed God, and through simply sense-perception see the Hidden God. Kattenbusch perpetuated the standpoint of the two terms as identical, asserting that ‘God hides himself in his revelation, so that revelation and hiddenness are not opposed, but coincide’.  Modern Theological Application  Luther’s theology has remained relevant in a multitude of modern theological debates such as evolutionary debate. = Evolutionary Debate = Theologian Charlene Burns has examined meaning of violent evolution with regards to Christian theology. Scientific discoveries continue to uncover violence as a marker of the origin of the world, from the ‘movement of fault lines in the earth to the extinction of species’. Burns uses a phenomenological approach to discuss the violence which is inherent to evolution. Burns states that ‘God is revealed not in the suffering of Christ on the cross, per se, but in what that suffering stimulates’, and states that evolution has led to humanity becoming ‘destroyers’. Burns concludes by asserting that the idea of God being revealed through the suffering of Christ exemplifies the altruistic nature of God, which humanity is called to emulate in its current advanced stage of evolution.

It is above this escarpment which is also popularly known as the Mavhuradonha Mountain range. The Valley below is also known as Dande. St. Alberts is located in a pristine area between Mount Darwin and Centenary, in a region of temperate weather. The Attack In July 1973, Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) cadres captured 292 pupils and staff from the school and force- marched them north towards Mozambique, where the ZANLA bases were. The march was intercepted by the Rhodesian Security Forces before the cadres crossed the border, and all but eight of the children and staff were recovered. Similar abductions were repeated over the following years and the security forces found themselves increasingly unable to prevent them. The captured schoolchildren would be marched to ZANLA bases in Mozambique where they would undergo \\"political 're-education'\\" (Abbott's and Botham's words) and guerrilla training. The school was closed in the late 1970s at the height of the Rhodesian Bush War. It had become a haven for the recruitment of communist backed terrorists.

Built in 1925, it originally served as a place of residence for unwed and pregnant mothers. It also housed the disabled, and served as a women's educational institution. The hospital and its surrounding campus—surrounded by Douglas fir trees—is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Contemporarily, it is the headquarters of the Albertina Kerr Centers for Children, a mental health institution in the Portland metropolitan area. History The original Louise Home was established in the Goose Hollow neighborhood of Portland, Oregon by William G. McLaren, who wanted to create awareness for unwed mothers. The home is believed to have taken its name from the house's first donor, or that of the sellers of the original home. The organization was run by Albertina Kerr. Kerr died of typhus in 1911, after which her husband Alexander donated the home to the Pacific Coast Rescue and Protective Society. The Louise Home Hospital and Residence Hall was built in 1925 on a plot of land in Gresham due to an increased need for boarding and medical care for unwed pregnant women, single mothers, and children. The Louise Home was the center of the campus, housing unwed young women, though additional buildings served as the Albertina Kerr Nursery and the Wynne Watts School, an educational institute for women. The Louise Home had its own self-sustaining farm that provided meat, dairy products, eggs, fruit, and vegetables for the residents.

Activities  The institute provided a range of consultancy services in the areas of management, economic and information to the central Russian government, companies related to nuclear energy, industrial holdings, federal subjects of the Russian Federation and state companies. The institute played a crucial role in the course of major reforms of the nuclear energy sector from 2005 to 2009. In particular, Atominform was responsible for the methodological and organisational support of the restructuring of the industry, foundation of Atomenergoprom holding and Rosatom state corporation. It developed the ERP system of Rosatom (powered by Oracle Database software).  History  Atominform (then known as Central Research and Development Institute for Information and Technoeconomic Studies in Nuclear Science and Technology [TsNIIatominform]) of the Ministry of Medium Machine-building Industry of the USSR was founded in 1967 by a decree of the USSR Council of Ministers. In 1991 Atominform was reorganised as Central Research and Development Institute for Management, Economy and Information of the Ministry of Nuclear Energy and Industry of the USSR in order to assist the nuclear sector in its adaptation to market economy. In 2007 the Institute developed and supervised a model pilot project that aimed to radically increase the economic efficiency of the sector and created a plan for the accelerated reorganisation of the industry as a part of the reform. Also, in 2007 the Institute organised the first industrial conference for the representatives of the nuclear energy industry and its suppliers. In March 2009 as a result of ongoing reorganisation the functions of the Institute were reassigned to newly created independent organisations. Its building at 2 Dmitrovskoye Highway in Moscow was assigned to the Engineering company “Atomstroiexport” - nuclear power equipment and service exporter, division of Rosatom.  Awards  In 2008 Atominform achieved top positions in 5 nominations according to Expert Rating Agency: Strategy and Business Development Consultancy, Financial Management Consultancy, Legal Consultancy, Goods and Services Production Consultancy, Marketing and PR Consultancy.

Its name and boundaries were created on 16 October 2000. The name is derived from Mundic Creek, a stream which enters the Murray River from within the locality. Mundic Creek extends from the Murray River channel in the west to the Sturt Highway on higher ground in the east over a floodplain known in one source as the Pike River Basin and in another as the Pike Floodplain and which it shares with the localities of Paringa in the north and Pike River in the south. Most of the floodplain located in what is now the locality was flooded by the 1956 Murray River flood and those parts existing as permanent water bodies are part of the nationally important wetland known as the Pike-Mundic Wetland Complex. Land use within Mundic Creek and adjoining localities consists of ‘primary production’ activities such as agriculture, fishing, irrigation and sand mining, recreation activities concerned with watercraft, fishing and hunting, residential use, and nature conservation as represented by the Pike River Conservation Park. Land in the majority of the locality is either zoned as the ‘River Murray Flood Zone’ or the ‘River Murray Fringe Zone’ which makes it subject to statutory control for the purposes of “conservation and improvement of water quality” as per the River Murray Act 2003. The 2016 Australian census which was conducted in August 2016 reports that Mundic Creek had a population of 34 people.

History  The history of the orchestra dates back to 1917 when musician Valerian Mizandar assembled 65 musicians in the ninth horse riding range of the Georgian Cadet Corps and created a large military brass orchestra, which had never been before. In 1918, after the declaration of independence of Georgia, it was called the People's Guards Band. It was abolished during the Soviet era and was replaced with the massed military bands of the Transcaucasian Military District. The Military Band of the National Guard of Georgia was created in 1991 with the establishment of the Georgian Armed Forces on the basis of the People's Guard Band and the HQ Band of the Transcaucasian Military District, whose personnel were absorbed by the new formation. In the beginning, its repertoire only consisted of national anthems, and military marches. Nowadays, the orchestra performs music that includes classical and contemporary music. It has participated in many international military music festivals, such as the Military Band's Festival in Riga, Latvia, the Festival of Military Bands in Muscat, Oman, the International Music Festival “Autumn Tbilisi”, and the Black Sea Jazz Festival in Batumi. In February 2016, the Defence Ministry of Georgia announced a competition to submit the best pieces of military music to be performed by the orchestra on Georgia's Independence Day on May 26.Competition announced for creating military march music In June 2017, the band performed with The Salamanca Band of the Rifles of the United Kingdom during its tour of the region.

Life  Rissberger was born in Worms, Germany, in 1948. His father was a locksmith. He studied an apprenticeship in television technology-craftsmanship, followed by further study in Frankfurt and Darmstadt in electrical engineering, computer sciences, and vocational education. He focused on educational psychology and political sciences. He holds a diploma in engineering and completed the first and second state examinations in vocational education. He financed his studies by working as a night cargo workman at Frankfurt Airport and by setting up informatics-course- systems at community colleges in Frankfurt-Höchst and Worms. The concept of these informatics-courses was the foundation for recommendations by the Gesellschaft für Informatik (\\"German Informatics Society\\") and by the Deutsche Volkshochschul-Verband e.V. (\\"German Community College Union\\") for vocational education. He has been married twice and has two children with his first wife. From 1970 until 1991 he taught and led activities in colleges. He also provided advanced training to executive managers in businesses. As a college professor, his focus was applied informatics, though he also taught informatics, trade, foreign business, taxation, and tourism at the University of Applied Sciences of the state Rhineland-Palatinate, Worms. He lectured for ten years at the BASF-Führungskolleg at the University Seminary of Economy in the water castle Gracht in Liblar near Cologne. Since 1974 Rissberg has been a political and economical consultant with an emphasis on success and efficiency in the IT-age. He is a surveyor at the Enquete-Komission Deutschlands Weg in die Informationsgesellschaft (Enquete-Commission Germany's path to an information society) of the German Bundestag, a member of the science advisory council of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, a chairman of the Mecklenburg- Vorpommern multimedia advisory council, a leader of e-learning research projects, and an author of textbooks, television, and video productions.

He was responsible for the introduction of IT basic education in secondary education in all public schools within the state. He is also the editor of the first German IT basic education schoolbook published by Klett-Verlag. Rissberger was a leader of a number of German and European first-time BLK-model-experiments in e-learning. He generated ideas for new school formats (such as the technical collage for informatics) and new vocational training areas. In 1987 he was the first German scientist who was responsible for a model experiment by the Federal State Commission for education management and research support (BLK) which studied e-learning at an elementary school. From 1985 to 1993 Rissberger was responsible for IT basic education (ITG) and e-learning in theRhineland-Palatinate's education system. From 1993 until 2005 he was the managing director of DVZ Datenverarbeitungszentrums Mecklenburg-Vorpommern GmbH (data processing center).

In organometallic chemistry, metallacyclopentanes are compounds with the formula LnM(CH2)4 (Ln = ligands, and M = metal). They are a type of metallacycle. Metallacyclopentanes are intermediates in some metal-catalysed reactions in homogeneous catalysis. Synthesis and structure Traditionally, metallacyclopentanes are prepared by dialkylation of metal dihalides with 1,4‐bis(bromomagnesio)butane or the related dilithio reagent. The complex Ni(bipyridine)C4H8 is prepared by oxidative addition of 1,4-dibromobutane to Ni(0) precursors. Metallacyclopentanes also arise via the dimerization of ethylene within the coordination sphere of a low-valence metal center. This reaction is relevant to the catalytic production of butenes and related alkenes. Occurrence Early examples of metallacyclopentanes come from studies of the Ni-catalyzed linear- and cyclo-dimerization of ethylenes. Linear dimerization proceeds via beta-hydride elimination of the nickelacyclopentane (Ph3P)Ni(CH2)4 whereas cyclodimerization to give cyclobutane proceeds by reductive elimination from the related (Ph3P)2Ni(CH2)4. Another example of a metallacyclopentane is the titanocene derivative Cp2Ti(CH2)4. Metallacyclopentanes are intermediates in the metal-catalysed dimerization, trimerization, and tetramerization of ethylene to give 1-butene, 1-hexene, and 1-octene, respectively. These compounds are of commercial interest as comonomers, used in the production of polyethylene. Cyclopentane and a metallacyclopentane. The chromium-catalyzed trimerization In the evolution of heterogeneous alkene metathesis catalysts, metallacyclopentanes are invoked as intermediates in the formation of metal alkylidenes from ethylene. Thus, metallacyclopentane intermediates are proposed to isomerize to metallacyclobutanes, which can eliminate alkene giving the alkylidene.  Structure Unsubstituted metallacyclopentanes adopt conformations related to cyclopentane itself: open-envelope conformation and a twisted open-envelope structure.

Karosen was an American businessman, author and philanthropist who served on the board of several charitable organizations. He was the President and CEO of the Fisher Center for Alzheimer's Research Foundation, a nonprofit health organization. For many years he had been a managing director and Partner at Cantor Fitzgerald, a Wall Street firm. The company's offices, located on floors 101 to 105 of 1 World Trade Center, were destroyed by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, killing 658 of the company's 960 New York employees. On October 1, 2001, Karosen organized a memorial service in New York's Central Park for over 4,000 family members and friends of those killed. Until his death, he continued to put together an annual celebration of life event for the families of Cantor Fitzgerald's victims on the anniversary of the attacks. In the fall of 2016, Karosen wrote, with children's book author Chana Stiefel, \\"Why Can't Grandma Remember My Name?\\", which juxtaposes paintings and drawings created by children with those created by Alzheimer's patients. It tackles a child's questions such as \\"How can I have fun with Grandma?\\" and \\"Will Grandma get worse?\\" and offers advice for families coping with the illness, with royalties benefiting the foundation. Karosen was on the Board of Trustees of the Intrepid Sea, Air, & Space Museum Foundation and was the chairman of its investment committee. He served on the board of directors of Temple Emanu-El Synagogue in Miami Beach, Florida. Kent died at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach, Florida on Thursday, December 6, 2018, at the age of 53. Kent was born in Kansas City, Missouri, to Mary Vivian and Leon Karosen, who lived in Mission Hills, Kansas. His father, Leon, was an owner of the Kansas City Kings, the National Basketball Association team, and Youthcraft Coats and Suits, Inc. After graduating from Kenyon College with a Bachelor of Arts in History and extensive study in economics, Kent went on to become a commercial real estate developer in Kansas City, Missouri. In 1991, Kent joined Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P., the Manhattan securities firm. He was a partner and managing director and worked closely with the chairman in resolving numerous special situations by utilizing his long-standing expertise in a myriad of business arenas. Before working in the office of the chairman, Kent was instrumental in the development and success of the Securities Lending Desk at Cantor Fitzgerald. In 1992, he founded the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum's \\"Museum Society\\" where he created the Salute to Freedom Award and dinner, a tradition that has raised over $20 million for the museum. The award has honored leaders such as presidents Reagan, Bush and Clinton; Prime Ministers Thatcher and Rabin and Secretaries Cohen and Powell. Kent's skills and efforts proved critical to Cantor Fitzgerald's recovery after the September 11 attacks destroyed the firm's headquarters in the World Trade Center. The day after the tragedy, he organized and managed the Crisis Center to aid the 658 families of the victims of the 9/11 attacks and continued to organize Cantor's annual memorial service in honor of his fallen colleagues. In May 2001, Kent was named an Honorary Commodore in the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary for the 1st Southern Region. Additionally, he was a member of the Board of Trustees of the Michael Stern Parkinson's Foundation and served as the Chairman of its Investment Committee. Not one to miss an opportunity to do the right thing, Kent headed the team to secure temporary headquarters for Cantor Fitzgerald and directed the search for their permanent headquarters. He was instrumental in the lease negations for Cantor Fitzgerald's 190,000 sq. ft. new headquarters as well as Cantor's public incentives to rebuild in New York City. Concurrently, Kent was a principal in securing for Cantor Fitzgerald and other firms directly affected by the 9/11 attacks over $30 million in federal, state and city aid to rebuild. In 2006, Honorable Scott Stringer appointed Kent as his representative to the Times Square Alliance board. Kent was also a board member for the New York City Fund for Public Advocacy, Midwest Chapter of the Leukemia Society, United States Coast Guard Foundation and the Wilbraham Monson Academy. He later joined the boards of the Intrepid Foundation and the Fisher Center for Alzheimer's Research Foundation where he had served as the foundation's President and CEO since 2009. In 2008, he married the love of his life, Brian Byrl Hauserman, in Provincetown, Massachusetts and again in a religious ceremony in New York City, NY. Mr. Hauserman was a residential broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman in Manhattan. Together, they managed the business consulting firm, Karosen Strategic Partners, LLC where Kent served as President. They relocated to Miami Beach, Florida where Kent became enthusiastically active in the Jewish community. He served on the board of directors for the Temple Emanu-El Synagogue. Kent was a force to be reckoned with and he lived his life on his own terms to the fullest. He was very generous and saw the potential in others. He strategically figured out various ways to connect the dots and expand his influence to raise money and awareness for worthy causes. His feisty spirit will be missed by all who knew him. Surviving Kent is his husband Brian Hauserman, sister Valerie K. Gaines, two puppies Mazel and Tova, and scores of dear friends whom he loved like family.

According locals of Voi Town, Kivoi settled along Voi River in the mid 1800s. His actual birth date is unknown as is not recorded but he its believed to have lived between 1780s to 19 August 1852. His descendants are not known in historical context but he was adversely mentioned by Dr. Ludwig Krapf in his Mission to Africa. According to Dr. Ludwig Krapf, he was killed together with his immediate followers after his caravan was attacked by robbers in the second expedition in Tana River 2 miles from Yatta. According to his diary entry Ludwig Krapf says, 'This expedition proved most calamitous, and, as already mentioned, Krapf's \\"escape with life was a marvel.' 'When within a mile or two of the Dana, the party was suddenly attacked by robbers. The greater part of the caravan was instantly dispersed, Kivoi's people flying in all directions; Kivoi himself was killed with his immediate followers; Krapf fired his gun twice, but into the air, \\"for,\\" said he, \\"I could not bring myself to shed the blood of man;\\" and then he found himself in the bash, separated from both friend and foe, and flying in what he supposed to be the best direction.' After the death of Chief Kivoi, Ludwig Krapf was accused of causing his death and the Akamba condemned him to die also. At midnight he managed to escape, and fled in the direction of Yatta. His perils were now greater than before, as he was in an inhabited country, and feared to travel by day lest he should be detected and murdered, while at night he frequently missed his way, and in the dense darkness of the forests his compass was of little use.

He was the architect of the Saint-Pierre-et-Saint-Paul of Nantes Cathedral for at least 36 years, starting no later than 1444 and ending no earlier than 1480.  Biography  The information regarding Mathurin Rodier (also known as Mathelin Rodier) is fragmentary. We know he was coming to Nantes from Tours, where he had a brother, Jean Rodier, and that in 1484, he was married to Édeline Ponset Il travaille sur le chantier de la cathédrale Saint-Gatien de Tours under the direction of Jean de Dammartin between 1431 and 1434, to a position equivalent to that of Jean Benoist and Huguet of Dammartin, son of Jean. Before 1444 he went to Nantes, where he took charge of several building sites, on the Saint-Nicolas gate, the , the cathedral, the Château des ducs de Bretagne, the . The presence of Mathurin Rodier at the head of the Nantes cathedral site is attested in 1444, with the charge of maistre masson. Most of the few writings concerning him still preserved relate to his emoluments. While managing the site, he was obliged to perform periods of city guard (according to a 1468 text), an obligation instituted by the municipality. A document from 1477 shows that Rodier was exempted from this charge in return for payment. In 1480 the canons in charge of supervising the building site decided to add Jean Le Maître to Mathurin Rodier, then approximately 70 years old. His ageing is undoubtedly the cause of this novelty, and in the same year the load of the building site was withdrawn, at the end of a remarkably long period for the time. The last written record of Rodier is of an anniversary he and his wife celebrated at Saint-Laurent Church on August 6 or 9, 1484. So he died after that date, most likely in Nantes.

England and Great Britain had long-standing interests in colonial Latin America, including privateering, the slave trade (and its abolition), and founding their own colonies in the West Indies. Britain supported the independence of the Latin American colonies from Spain around 1820, and developed extensive trade and financial relationships with most of the newly independent countries, opening shipping lines and building railways. After the Spanish–American War of 1898, American financial interests increasingly played a role in the diplomatic relations. Traditional British business interests continued until most of its regional assets were sold in 1914–1918 to pay for the British war effort during the First World War. After 1820, British military involvements were minimal in the region. A boundary squabble with Venezuela in the 1890s turned dangerous when the United States intervened; there were no profound issues involved and the dispute was soon permanently resolved. There was a short war to expel an Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands in 1982. Colonial era In the colonial era of Latin America before 1820, England and Great Britain was allied with Portugal, and maintained friendly diplomatic relations with Portugal's colony in Brazil. Despite this, English privateers launched attacks on Brazilian ports, such as Santos in 1591. However, there was often serious hostility with Spain.Adrian Finucanem, The Temptations of Trade: Britain, Spain, and the Struggle for Empire (2016) Independent English privateers frequently attacked Spanish interests, and dreamed of somehow attacking and seizing the annual Spanish fleet that brought gold and silver back to Spain. The 16th century, Sir John Hawkins and Sir Francis Drake were leading privateers. In the 17th century the Caribbean was a favorite target, especially 1655 two 1670 on Spanish ships and Spanish towns. In various wars, English privateers seized bases in Spanish Jamaica and other Spanish colonies in the Carribean, and buccaneers established a foothold on the mainland in Central America. In 1671, Welsh privateer Henry Morgan sacked and burned Panama City, looting its treasures of gold, silver and jewels, but overlooking the golden altar, which had been painted over to disguise its value. Morgan at the time was Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica. From his base in Port Royal, Jamaica, he raided settlements and shipping on the Spanish Main, becoming wealthy as he use the prize money gained to purchase three large sugar plantations. British merchants handled most of the trade between Europe and Latin America, due to few Spanish or Portuguese merchants being in competition. By 1824 as Spain left the region about 90 British commercial houses were operating in the former Spanish colonies, with a concentration in Buenos Aires.Dorothy Burne Goebel, \\"British Trade to the Spanish Colonies, 1796-1823' American Historical Review 43#2 (1938), pp. 288-320 online Already in 1810 there were 200 in Brazil.Manuel Llorca-Jaña, \\"British Merchants in New Markets: The Case of Wylie and Hancock in Brazil and the River Plate, c. 1808–19.\\" Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History 42.2 (2014): 215-238. The Atlantic slave trade had significant British participation until the British outlawed it in 1807, and in 1833 abolished slavery in all its colonies. Spain granted exclusive rights to the British South Sea Company to supply slaves to its colonies. The South Sea Company simultaneously engaged in illegal commercial trade as well, and once Spain tried to stop it the result was the Anglo-Spanish War of Jenkins Ear that dragged on for a decade after 1739. The war began after Welsh merchant Robert Jenkins was seized by Spanish sailors who cut off his ears. The British captured Porto Bello in November 1739. Governor James Oglethorpe of Georgia led an attack on St. Augustine, Florida, in 1740; Spain retaliated with an attack in St. Simon's Island, Georgia.Ignacio Rivas, Mobilizing Resources for War: The British and Spanish Intelligence Systems in the War of Jenkins' Ear (1739-1744) (2010). During the Napoleonic Wars of 1801–1815, Spain was allied with Napoleon and its colonies were now a potential target for the Royal Navy. The result was two British invasions of the River Plate. British Admiral Home Riggs Popham launched an invasion of the Spanish colony of La Plata (modern-day Argentina). Popham had an army of 1500 men, who quickly captured the fort at Buenos Aires, capturing the city of 55,000 inhabitants. Argentine creoles (that is, native-born men of Spanish descent) mobilized their local and nearby forces, including 1,000 soldiers from the nearby city of Montevideo. They overpowered the British, who surrendered on August 14, 1806. In response London sent new armies to Buenos Aires and Valparaiso. The second British attack came in 1807, as British General John Whitelocke brought 12,000 soldiers for his invasions of Montevideo and Buenos Aires. The decisive battle came in June 1807; the Argentines were outnumbered 12,000 to 9,000. They nevertheless prevailed and the British again surrendered. Meanwhile, Napoleon invaded Portugal, and the Royal Navy rescued the royal family taking it to Brazil. The great British naval victory at Trafalgar in October 1805 decisively gave control of the oceans to the British, and ended Napoleonic overseas dreams.John Francis Bannon and Peter Masten Dunne, Latin America: an historical survey (1947) pp 320-25.Ben Hughes, The British Invasion of the River Plate 1806-1807: How the Redcoats Were Humbled and a Nation Was Born (2014). Independence era after 1820 Admiral Thomas Cochrane, the 10th Earl of Dundonald. The French invasion of Spain opened two decades (1806–26) of military conflict over control of the Spanish colonies. By 1818, Spain had regained control of all of its colonies. Suddenly starting in 1819, with the return of Simón Bolívar from exile Spain's power collapsed and one after another succeeded in breaking away, except for Cuba. Admiral Thomas Cochrane was the most prominent of some 10,000 British mercenaries hired to organize the ad-hoc armies and navies fighting for independence from Spain. Cochrane organised and led the rebel navies of Chile and Brazil and helped Peru as well.Moises Enrique Rodriguez, Freedom's Mercenaries: British Volunteers in the Wars of Independence of Latin America (2 vol. 2006) online review.Brian Vale, “British Sailors and the Brazilian Navy, 1822–1850,” Mariner's Mirror 80#3 (1994): 312-25. The independence of Latin American countries after 1826, opened lucrative prospects for London financiers. The region was gravely devastated by the wars of independence, and with weak financial systems, weak governments and repeated coups and internal rebellions. However, the region had a well- developed export sector focused on the foods that were in demand in Europe, especially sugar, coffee, wheat and (after the arrival of refrigeration in the 1860s), beef. There also was a well-developed mining sector. With the Spanish out of the picture, the region in the early 1820s was a devastated region suffering in a deep depression. It urgently needed capital, entrepreneurs, financiers, and shippers. Britain rushed in to fill the void by the middle 1820s, as the London government use its diplomatic power to encourage large- scale investment. the Royal Navy provided protection against piracy. The British established communities of merchants in major cities—including 3,000 Britons in Buenos Aires.R.A. Humphreys, \\"British Merchants and South American Independence,\\" Proceedings of the British Academy (1965), Vol. 51, pp151-174 online. London financiers purchased £17 million in Latin American government bonds, especially those of Argentina, Chile, Peru and Mexico. They invested another £35 million in 46 stock companies set up to operate primarily in Latin America. The bubble soon burst, but the survivors operated quietly and profitably for many decades. In the 1820s-1850s, over 260 British merchant houses operated in the River Plate or Chile, and hundreds more in the rest of Latin America.J.F. Rippy, The Evolution of international Business 1800-1945: vol 1: British Investments in Latin America, 1822-1949 (1949) p 17.Manuel Llorca-Jaña, \\"The organisation of British textile exports to the River Plate and Chile: Merchant houses in operation, c. 1810–59.\\" Business History 53#6 (2011): 821-865. The Latin American market was important for the cotton manufacturers of Lancashire. They supported the independence movement, and persuaded the British government to station commercial consuls in all the major trading centers in Latin America. the British were permanently committed, and it took decades – until the 1860s – before the commercial and involvement paid serious dividends. By 1875, Latin America was firmly integrated into transatlantic economy under British leadership. After 1898, the British had to compete commercially with the Americans.Ronald Hyam, Britain's Imperial Century 1815-1914 (2002) pp 57-61 In long-term perspective, Britain's influence in Latin America was enormous after independence came in the 1820s. Britain intentionally sought to replace the Spanish in economic and cultural affairs. Military issues and the establishment of new colonies were minor factors. The influence was exerted through diplomacy, trade, banking, and investment in railways and mines. The English language and British cultural norms were transmitted by energetic young British business agents on temporary assignment in the major commercial centers, where they inviting locals into the British leisure activities, such as organized sports, and into their transplanted cultural institutions such as clubs and schools.Alina Silveira, \\"Educating a City's Children: British Immigrants and Primary Education in Buenos Aires (1820-1880).\\" The Americas 70#1 (2013): 33-62. The impact on sports was overwhelming, as Latin America enthusiastically took up football (soccer). In Argentina, rugby, polo, tennis and golf became important in middle-class leisure. Cricket was ignored. The British role never disappeared, but it faded rapidly after 1914 as the British cashed in their investments to pay for their Great War, and the United States moved into the region with overwhelming force and similar cultural norms.Oliver Marshall, ed. English-Speaking Communities in Latin America (2000). =Confrontations= There were no actual wars directly involving Britain, however there were several confrontations. The most serious came in 1845-1850 when British and French navies blockaded Buenos Aires in order to protect the independence of Uruguay from Juan Manuel de Rosas, the dictator of Argentina. Other lesser controversies with Argentina broke out in 1833, with Guatemala in 1859, Mexico in 1861, Nicaragua in 1894, and Venezuela in 1895 and 1902. There also was tension along the Mosquito Coast in Central America in the 1830s and 1840s.Michael Rheta Martin and Gabriel H. Lovett, Encyclopedia of Latin- American History (1968) p 17. =Transoceanic canal= London's interest in Central America began in the 17th century, focused first in Belize, Roatán, and the Mosquito Coast (which became the east coast of Nicaragua and Honduras). Washington's interest began in 1824 with the diplomatic recognition of the five states of Central America. Britain consolidated its hold on the Caribbean shore and an unforeseen result was a direct clash with the United States. In 1848 the U.S. saw the need a transoceanic canal, a plan reinforced by the flood of gold seekers using a Central-American transit route in 1849. One route under consideration went through Nicaragua but was frustrated by British control of the Mosquito Coast. This conflict was resolved in 1850 when the two powers agreed in the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty to renounce territorial possessions along the route of a possible canal. To prevent the domination of Pacific trade routes by the other, each agreed that any canal would be neutral and they would not acquire formal colonies on the route. In 1901 Britain renounced its claims in the Hay–Pauncefote Treaty, allowing the United States to build the Panama Canal, which opened in 1914.Robert Arthur Humphreys, \\"Anglo-American Rivalries in Central America.\\" Transactions of the Royal Historical Society 18 (1968): 174-208. =Informal empire in Latin America= In a highly influential interpretation, John Andrew Gallagher and Ronald Robinson argue that the perceived pause in British expansion in the mid-19th century is misleading, for Britain's was in fact successful in achieving its main goal of building an informal empire, with strong economic relationships to small independent countries, especially in Latin America. Other historians have found that coercion was seldom necessary in Latin America and the British government played a passive role. The Royal Navy made sure that London's fast overseas network was well protected. London provided finance, insurance, and shipping, handled imports and exports, purchased and refinanced of bonds and government debts, and sent money and engineers to build the railway network. Young British agents on temporary duty in every major port provided close links to the mother country, and provided a model of middle-class business and cultural leadership that many Latin Americans emulated.Thomas E. Skidmore, Peter H. Smith and James N. Green, Modern Latin America (8th ed 2013) pp 397–402. Latin American business realized the advantage of close ties with the world's leading banker and trader. Gallagher and Robinson argue that using: :informal dependencies in the mid-Victorian age there was much effort to open the continental interiors and to extend the British influence inland from the ports. The general strategy of this development was to convert these areas into complementary satellite economies, which would provide food and raw materials for Great Britain, and also provide widening markets for its manufactures....Once entry had been forced into Latin America ... the task was to encourage stable governments as good investment risks, just as in weaker or unsatisfactory states it was considered necessary to coerce them into more cooperative attitudes.John Gallagher, and Ronald Robinson, \\"The Imperialism of Free Trade\\" Economic History Review 6#1 (1953), pp. 1–15. quoting pp 8-9. in JSTOR =Search for cotton= Cotton textiles were Britain's leading manufacturing product in the mid-19th century, and most of the raw cotton came from the southern United States. The American Civil War cut off most of the supply, although small amounts were available through blockade runners, and through purchases in New York of cotton owned by the Union. It became a high British priority to find new sources, looking especially Egypt, India, and Brazil.. Sven Beckert, \\"Emancipation and Empire: Reconstructing the Worldwide Web of Cotton Production in the Age of the American Civil War,” American Historical Review 109 (2004): 1405–38; Leading nations =Argentina= They established diplomatic relations on 15 December 1823. By mid-century, London bankers were sending in capital, to invest in railways, docks, packing houses, and utilities. London sent in 3000 agents to handle shipping, insurance, and banking. There was still a labor shortage, which was solved when Italian and Spanish immigrants started to migrate to Argentina, often on British passenger liners.Samuel Amaral, The Rise of Capitalism on the Pampas: The Estancias of Buenos Aires, 1785-1870 (1999). Britain was the main purchaser of Argentine beef and grain. During the Second World War, Argentina refused to go along with the American anti-German policies. The United States responded by trying to shut down Argentine exports. President Franklin Roosevelt asked Prime Minister Winston Churchill to stop buying Argentine beef and grain. Churchill refused, saying the food was urgently needed.Elisabeth Barker, Churchill and Eden at War (1979) p 202. They went to war—the Falklands War—over ownership of the Falkland Islands in 1982; Britain drove out Argentine invaders. =Brazil= In 1807, all members of the royal court of Portugal (probably 4,000 to 7,000 individuals) relocated to Brazil in the transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil to avoid being captured by the French. Pedro the Prince Regent ruled because his mother, Queen Carlota, was insane. Brazilian trade had been limited to the mother country, but now the Prince Regent expanded it to encourage commerce with all friendly nations, especially Great Britain. This expansion of trade led to the economic and eventually political independence of Brazil from Portugal in 1822.José Luís Cardoso, \\"Free Trade, Political Economy and the Birth of a New Economic Nation: Brazil, 1808–1810.\\" Revista de Historia Económica-Journal of Iberian and Latin American Economic History 27#2 (2009): 183-204, online free in English Slave trade The two nations established diplomatic relations in 1826, after the British imposed a treaty pledging the total abolition of the Atlantic slave trade. By the 1830s, British financiers and merchants effectively controlled the leading sectors of the Brazilian economy.Alan Krebs Manchester, British Preëminence in Brazil, Its Rise and Decline: A Study in European Expansion (1933) pp. 1-158. A high priority of the British government was ending the large-scale Brazilian slave trade, but Brazilian elites strongly resisted, saying the treaties had been coerced and were invalid.Manchester, British Preëminence in Brazil, pp. 165-276. in 1845, the Royal Navy started to target Brazilian slave ships seizing the ships and freeing the slaves onboard. Tensions escalated and there was a threat of war. Meanwhile, Brazilian plantation owners imported as many slaves as they possibly could, 19,000 in 1846, and 50,000 in 1847. Finally, in 1850, the Brazilian government passed laws that virtually ended Brazilian involvement in the slave trade. That ended the tension with Britain, but the practise of slavery continued in Brazil.Tâmis Parron, \\"The British Empire and the Suppression of the Slave Trade to Brazil: A Global History Analysis.\\" Journal of World History 29.1 (2018): 1-36. By the 1850s, Brazil provided about a third of the raw cotton used in British factories.Hyam, Britain's Imperial Century 1815-1914 (2002) p 57 They were allies in the Second World War, fighting alongside each other in Italy against Nazi Germany. =Chile= British naval officers assisted Chile in its fight for independence, and over the following decades a number of Britons settled in Chile such as in Coquimbo. In tandem with British investors, Chile entered world economic trade during the 1810s-1830s. the new country was poor, but investors were optimistic regarding its resources in agriculture and mining. Copper and silver production increased, as did farm output. The population grew, and trade rapidly expanded. most important, Chile developed the institutional mechanisms for sustained economic growth and more complex trade relationships.Manuel Llorca-Jaña, and Juan Navarrete-Montalvo, \\"The Chilean Economy during the 1810–1830s and its Entry into the World Economy.\\" Bulletin of Latin American Research 36#3 (2017): 354-369. =Mexico= After Mexico declared its independence in 1810, Britain was the first European great power to recognize Mexican sovereignty. Soon afterwards, Emperor Agustín de Iturbide sent a diplomatic envoy to London to establish diplomatic communications between the two nations. In 1837, Mexico signed a treaty with Britain to abolish the slave trade.History of diplomatic relations between Mexico and the United Kingdom (in Spanish) The British established a network of merchant houses in the major cities. However, according to Hilarie J. Heath, the results were bleak: trade was stagnant, imports did not pay, contraband drove prices down, debts private and public went unpaid, merchants suffered all manner of injustices and operated at the mercy of weak and corruptible governments, with commercial houses skirting bankruptcy.Hilarie J. Heath, \\"British Merchant Houses in Mexico, 1821-1860: Conforming Business Practices and Ethics,\\" Hispanic American Historical Review 73#2 (1993), pp. 261-290 online In 1861, Mexican President Benito Juarez suspended Mexico's interest payments to its creditors in France, Spain and the UK. This act angered the three nations and in October 1861 by the Convention of London the three sent a joint naval force to Mexico to demand repayment. In December 1861 the triple- alliance took the port of Veracruz and nearby towns. After a few months, both the Spanish and British government became aware that Emperor Napoleon III of France was planning to colonize Mexico in order to expand its empire and take advantage of the fact that the United States was tied down in its civil war and was not able to enforce the Monroe Doctrine. In early 1862, Britain and Spain pulled their forces from Mexico, but France took control and imposed an emperor. He was defeated and executed by Juarez in 1867. After 1880, the British turned their attention in Mexico primarily to investments in railways and mines, sending both money and engineers and skilled mechanics. The British invested £7.4 million in railways during the decade of the 1880s, jumping to £53.4 million in 1910s. The decade-total of new investment in mining went from £1.3 million in 1880s to £11.6 million in 1910s. Investments in land and other properties rose from near zero in 1880s to £19.7 million in 1910s. The totals reached £135 million, almost as much as the United States. In 1900, there were 2,800 British citizens living in Mexico, a relatively small number in contrast to the 15,000 Americans, 16,000 Spaniards, 4,000 French, and 2,600 Germans. The British were famed for their sophisticated gentlemen clubs, and their elaborate sports program—English football became a highly popular sport across Mexico; while cricket was ignored.Barbara A. Tenenbaum, and James N. McElveen, \\"From speculative to substantive boom: the British in Mexico, 1821-1911.\\" in Oliver Marshall, ed. English speaking communities in Latin America (Macmillan, 2000): 51-79, at p 69. In 1938 the government of Lázaro Cárdenas nationalised land owned by British oil companies in Mexico.Catherine E. Jayne, Oil, war, and Anglo-American relations: American and British reactions to Mexico's expropriation of foreign oil properties, 1937-1941 (2001) After 1945, bilateral relations normalized and trade re-commenced. = Venezuela = During the Venezuelan crisis of 1895 there was a longstanding dispute between the United Kingdom and Venezuela about the territory of Guayana Esequiba, which Britain claimed as part of British Guiana and Venezuela asserting the region as Venezuelan territory. The dispute had become a diplomatic crisis when Venezuelan representatives argued that British behaviour over the issue violated the 1823 Monroe Doctrine and used its influence in the American government to pursue the matter. US President Grover Cleveland adopted a broad interpretation of the doctrine that did forbade new European colonies but also declared an American interest in any matter in the hemisphere.Zakaria, Fareed, From Wealth to Power (1999). Princeton University Press. . pp145–146 After tense diplomatic dialogues, the British government accepted the US demand for arbitration.Paul Gibb, \\"Unmasterly Inactivity? Sir Julian Pauncefote, Lord Salisbury, and the Venezuela Boundary Dispute,\\" Diplomacy and Statecraft, Mar 2005, Vol. 16 Issue 1, pp 23–55Nelson M. Blake, \\"Background of Cleveland's Venezuelan Policy,\\" American Historical Review, Vol. 47, No. 2 (Jan., 1942), pp. 259–277 in JSTOR The status of the territory later became subject to the Geneva Agreement of 1966, which was signed by the United Kingdom, Venezuela and British Guiana on 17 February 1966. This treaty stipulates that the parties will agree to find a practical, peaceful and satisfactory solution to the dispute.Agreement to resolve the controversy over the frontier between Venezuela and British Guiana (Treaty of Geneva, 1966) from UN Disputes over the territory have continued since, even after Guyana was granted independence the same year. The United Kingdom was involved in the Venezuela Crisis of 1902–1903, in which Britain was involved in a Italo-German blockade of Venezuela to enforce payment of Venezuelan debts.

History  Established in 2006, the drb launched its first full issue as an online quarterly review in Spring 2007. Founded and jointly edited by Enda O'Doherty, an Irish Times journalist, and Maurice Earls, the proprietor of Books Upstairs bookshop in Dublin, it is consciously modelled on its near-namesakes, the New York Review of Books and the London Review of Books. The magazine aims to provide writers with a forum to develop their arguments and share knowledge in longer review- essays than those found in conventional newspapers and magazines. Along with The Dublin Review, The Honest Ulsterman, The Stinging Fly, Poetry Ireland Review and various other titles, it is one of a number of periodicals to have contributed to a boom in Irish literary journals over the past decade. Since Autumn 2012, the drb has been published fortnightly online, with additional material published between each issue in the form of shorter blog posts.

It has three or four leaves at its base and up to four slightly drooping pale yellow flowers with dark reddish purple streaks. It is an uncommon species found in two disjunct populations, in higher parts of each of New South Wales and Victoria. Description Diuris ochroma is a tuberous, perennial herb with between three and four linear leaves long and wide. Up to four slightly drooping pale yellow flowers with dark reddish purple streaks and about wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal projects forward and is egg-shaped, long and wide. The lateral sepals are lance-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long, wide, lean downwards and are more or less parallel to each other. The petals are egg-shaped, long, wide and spread apart from each other on a green to purplish stalk long. The labellum is long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is oblong, wide with a raised ridge in its midline. The side lobes are oblong, about long, wide with dark reddish purple streaks. There are between two and four more or less parallel callus ridges in the lower part of the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs in November and December. Taxonomy and naming Diuris ochroma was first formally described in 1994 by David Jones from a specimen collected near the Wonnangatta River and the description was published in Muelleria. Jones stated that the specific epithet ochroma was derived from the Greek ochroma, and means \\"pale\\" or \\"wan\\", referring to the pale yellow flowers of this species. In ancient Greek, ochroma (ὤχρωμα) is a noun meaning \\"pallor\\".Liddell, H.G. & Scott, R. (1940). A Greek-English Lexicon. Revised and augmented throughout by Sir Henry Stuart Jones with the assistance of Roderick McKenzie.Oxford: Clarendon Press. Distribution and habitat The pale goat orchid occurs in two disjunct areas, one in New South Wales and one in Victoria. The New South Wales population, estimated in 2008 to include about 130 plants, occurs on the Monaro Tableland. Two Victorian populations, estimated to contain a total of about eight thousand plants in 2010, are found in the Alpine National Park and on a roadside near Abbeyard. Conservation Diuris ochroma is classed as \\"vulnerable\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, as \\"endangered\\" in New South Wales under the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016 and as \\"threatened\\" in Victoria under the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988. The main threats to the species are weed invasion, grazing by native, feral and stock animals, habitat loss and disturbance and inappropriate fire regimes.

It was named after Saint George and around 1300 the chapel of this leper colony stood in the place of the present St. Mary's Church. After the old parish church of the city, the St. Nicholas Church, was demolished around 1530, the Saint-George chapel became the new main church. Towards the end of the 16th century, John II, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg commissioned the enlargement of the building in order to make it suitable for the function of the parish church of his city.  The current St. Mary's Church  In 1595 a start was made on the partial demolition of the old church and the construction of the new church. Only parts of the old medieval church remained. From the medieval church, a medieval wooden wall cupboard dating from about 1400 remained. The solemn inauguration of the new parish church took place just before Christmas in 1600. In 1649 the George Church was renamed as the Mary Church. The name of Saint George stayed in the Danish names Sankt Jørgensgade and Jørgensbjerg.

The champions of the four different regions - North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia - automatically qualified to compete at the 2017 Capcom Cup. People qualified to compete in their regional finals by scoring highly on their regional leaderboard or winning ranking events during the 2017 Capcom Pro Tour. The four tournaments all took place between October 1 and November 19, 2017. Background from April to September 2017, Capcom held a Ranking Event season with tournaments all over the world. Players of each of the four regions - Europe, Latin America, North America, and Asia - could compete in these tournaments in order to gain points towards their regional leaderboard standing. The top 7 players of each leaderboard qualified for their respective regional final. The winner of each regional final automatically qualified for the 2017 Capcom Cup and were awarded 400 points on the global leaderboards. Unlike the 2016 Capcom Pro Tour regional competition, the regional events were region-locked so only residents of that region are allowed to compete. While describing the details of the 2017 Capcom pro Tour, Capcom stated that they \\"felt we could do more to truly highlight the talent from each region. The events ended up effectively being last chance qualifiers for all regions, and that is something we want to avoid this year. With points being awarded to players only from that region and the last chance qualifier being region locked, we will be able to truly see who the best player from each region is.\\" Each of the four regional finals was a two-day event with a \\"Last Chance Qualifier\\" on day 1 and an 8-player tournament on day 2. Each regional final had a purse of $30,000 USD, which was distributed among the top 8. The grand prize of each regional final, besides qualifying for the Capcom Cup, was $12,000 USD. Tournaments Four regional finals took place throughout the world between October 1 and November 19, 2017. These events were held (chronologically) in Europe, Asia, Latin America, and North America. =Europe= The European regional finals of the 2016 Capcom Cup were the first of the four events, held during the Milan Games Week in Milan, Italy on October 1. The tournament was won by Benjamin \\"Problem X\\" Simon, scoring a 3-2 win over Olivier \\"Luffy\\" Hay and defeating Arman \\"Phenom\\" Hanjani 3-1 in the grand finals. Problem X' triumph at the European regional finals constituted his fifth victory in the 2017 Capcom Pro Tour, and the top three all qualified for the Capcom Cup. =Asia= The Asian regional finals were held at the Southeast Asia Major at GameStart 2017 in Suntec City, Singapore, on October 14-15. The tournament was held side-by-side with the Tekken World Tour Asia Pacific Regional Championships and the Windjammers Asia Championships. The tournament was won by Tokido, playing using the character Akuma, defeating Li- Wei \\"Oil King\\" Lin in the grand finals. =Latin America= The Latin American regional finals were held on Saturday, November 4 in São Paulo. Brazilian laws prevented Capcom from offering any prize money at the event. The tournament was won by Brazilian Dhalsim player Renato \\"DidimoKOF\\" Pereira Martins. While DidimoKOF only finished ninth on the Latin American leaderboards, he was added to top 8 bracket (along with eighth-ranked Moisés \\"Moise\\" Berrios) when the region's two top-seed players both withdrew. Saul \\"MenaRD\\" Mena and Thomas \\"Brolynho\\" Proença had already secured a Capcom Cup placing and had little to gain by competing in a tournament with no prize pot. DidimoKOF won against Dominican player Cristhoper \\"Caba\\" Rodriguez in the opening round and went on to defeat Moise and Bruno \\"DoomSnake507\\" La Grotta before facing Caba again in the grand finals. Here, DidimoKOF defeated Caba's Guile by a 3-2 margin and won his first major tournament. =North America= The North American finals were hosted by Red Bull GmbH and held on November 18-19 at The Castle at Park Plaza in Boston, Massachusetts. The event, again titled \\"Red Bull Battlegrounds\\", was announced during a Capcom panel on the first day of Evo 2017. The Last Chance qualifier took the form of a 512-player open bracket tournament, featuring champions from regional events as well as the top amateur players from the online Red Bull Proving Grounds tournament. The Last Chance qualifier was won by Marcus \\"The Cool Kid93\\" Redmond, playing with the character Abigail. The Cool Kid93 was defeated by Victor \\"Punk\\" Woodley in the winner's quarterfinals and knocked out by Gustavo \\"801 Strider\\" Romero in the loser's bracket. Punk went on to win the tournament, defeating rising star Derek \\"iDom\\" Ruffin in the grand finals. Playing with the character Karin, Punk bested iDom's Laura three times, without taking a single loss. Capcom teased the inclusion of the character Sakura in Street Fighter V by releasing cherry blossom-like confetti during the closing ceremony of Red Bull Battlegrounds.

However, it split in 1893, with nearly 1,000 members leaving to form the Northern United Enginemen's Association, which eventually joined the rival National Amalgamated Union of Enginemen, Firemen, Mechanics, Motormen and Electrical Workers. The remaining members renamed the union as the National Amalgamated Society of Enginemen, Cranemen, Boilermen and Firemen, and slowly rebuilt its membership, which peaked at 4,056 in 1906. The union was based in North East England, but also had a significant membership in Scotland, particularly in the steel industry, where it appointed representatives to a board of conciliation. In England, it instead reached agreement to link its members' wages to those negotiated by the Amalgamated Society of Engineers. The union tried to broaden its membership, in 1906 becoming the National Amalgamated Society of Enginemen, Cranemen, Boilermen, Firemen and Electrical Workers, but in 1912 decided to merge into the British Steel Smelters, Mill, Iron, Tinplate and Kindred Trades Association.

Production The game was designed by Japanese surrealist Tomomi Yuki Sakuba. It was also directed by Sakuba, produced by Masahiro Ikuta, co-produced by Akihiko Kawa, and programmed by Akiya Hayashi. 3D graphics were completed by Gengo Ito and Hiroki Watanabe, and music was composed by Tomonori Tanaka. Sakuba began his interest in games with the title Cosmic Osmo, which he had played around 1990. After learning the game had been written on HyperCard, a software that comes for free with a Mac, he went to the library and began reading up how to program using the language. He made a few experimental projects including Hobbit's Great Adventure and Talking before setting his sights on making a full-fledged game. When sketching out the design of the hero, Sakuba settled on a creature with an organic head on the body of the machine. He eventually decided to make this the design of all the characters. At least one poster was designed before the final poster was chosen for marketing. The official website for the game was founded in August 1995, and the director maintained a diary to update his progress. The first release of this game was limited to 3,000 copies. The game's publisher, Toshiba-EMI, withdrew from CD-ROM publishing before further copies could be produced. Even in Japan, where the game was released, Garage is considered extremely rare, with only a few thousand copies in existence. When it appeared on the trading site Suruga-ya, it had an asking price of 300,000 yen. It is currently available on the internet due to members of the 4chan's /vr/ board finding it on auction and putting together the money to purchase and preserve it. The game's creator has resistance to republishing it, firstly because the \\"game balance\\" has changed, and secondly he does not own the rights to it. A Garage Private Edition went on sales in mid-2007, and quickly sold out. With permission of Tomomi Yuki Sakuba, the game was a repackaging of the first release. Plot and gameplay Garage is surreal and nightmarish point and click adventure set in a world full of biomechanical machines. The player takes control of a small robot who is tasked with finding an entity called the \\"shadow\\", and to escape the world in which they live. The game's graphics are pre-rendered and digitized. Critical reception Hardcore Gaming 101 deemed Garage a \\"profoundly uncomfortable game to look at\\", due to its unsettling nature.

The term 'Unnoticed Art' was originally mentioned by Dutch artist Frans van Lent as a basic concept for the first Unnoticed Art Festival, which took place in Haarlem (The Netherlands) in 2014. The first Unnoticed Art Festival took place over two days, during which time thirty volunteers executed the performance scores created by thirty five artists. An iteration of the first Unnoticed Art Festival was commissioned by Zeppelin University in Friedrichshafen in Germany to form part of their 2014 Sommerfest, the university's principal annual public engagement event. This used a selection of works devised for the Haarlem event. The second Unnoticed Art Festival took place in Nijmegen, 2016. The book Unnoticed Art was published in January, 2015. It contains an artistic statement by Frans van Lent and a catalogue of the Unnoticed Art Festival performances. The 'Unnoticed Art' concept was further developed into a blog titled UnnoticedArt.com. The purpose of this blog is to present a wide variety of art works that relate to the artistic attitude of the field of Unnoticed Art. In addition, TheConceptBank.org was initiated as a follow up from the first Unnoticed Art Festival, as an online free approachable database for performative concepts. Like the festival, TheConceptBank.org is based on the separation of concept creation (the artist) and execution (by visitors of the website). This website was launched in May 2014. Another derivation of the 'Unnoticed Art' concept, The ParallelShow, is recognised as a series of impromptu performances of occasional collaborations from performance art practitioners. It started on 7 July 2015 as a singular occasion at the Kunsthal in Rotterdam, NL. This first ParallelShow was a cooperation of three Dutch artists: Ieke Trinks, Ienke Kastelein and Frans van Lent. The concept of The ParallelShow took place unexpectedly at and around public exhibitions in art venues. It was never announced, no invitations are ever sent. Since the first show, The ParallelShow has also been initiated in nine other locations: 23 October 2015: at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden, Netherlands; 4 December 2015: at the M-Museumin Leuven, Belgium; 17 January 2016: at the Tate Britain, London, UK; 11 February 2016: at the Art Rotterdam art-fair, Rotterdam, Netherlands; 28 May 2016: at the Archeological Sites, Delphi, Greece; 5 June 2016: at the Huis van Gijn, Dordrecht, Netherlands; 18 September 2016: at the Institut Valencià d’Art Modern (IVAM), Valencia,On Tuesday 9 January 2018 Unnoticed Art, as part of the Elective: Mediation in the Willem de Kooning Academy/University of Applied Sciences, Rotterdam, made a collaboration in a combined lesson with the Facultat de Belles Arts de San Carles of the Universitat Politècnica de València, as part of the Project I+D ref.

Two brothers, then five and seven years old, were accused of murdering him and were claimed to have confessed. They were never convicted of a crime and from a judicial point of view are innocent. Almost twenty years later, on 27 March 2018, all suspicions against both brothers were dismissed by Swedish police after a lengthy second investigation of the case.  Case  Kyrkviken, part of Glafsfjorden lake in Arvika The theory that police were working from in 1998, was that Kevin Hjalmarsson had been murdered with a stick which had been pressed against his throat ending in his suffocation, and that his body had then been left on the shore of Kyrkviken, part of Glafsfjorden lake in Arvika, from the presumed murder site. How his body was transported there has not been ascertained. There were no drag marks on the ground or on Kevin's body. First responders were called about a drowning at Glafsfjorden; an ambulance was dispatched at 21:22 and took the boy to hospital, where the police first inspected the body. It was initially speculated that a pedophile was the perpetrator. Police at Länskriminalen in Värmland made an analysis of the victim and his life up to his death. Two brothers, five and seven years old, were accused of the murder and allegedly confessed. During further investigations, psychologist Sven Å. Christianson, professor at the psychological institute in Stockholm, was called in. He was later criticized for his handling of the Thomas Quick case which he had also been involved in.  Treatment of the children  The children have recently come forward and stated that the police threatened and misled them into \\"confessing\\" the crime. “They almost threw it at me and would say ‘yes this has happened’. It was a lot of pressure that was the thing that made it so scary.” and “I remember that I was afraid of the police [but] if I did what they wanted, they would be happy and satisfied”, said Robin, who wants an apology. The police had no recording of any confession, despite producing video and audio recordings of several other interrogations, which display serious pressure put on the boys to confess. The boys were never convicted of the murder, so they were legally only regarded as suspects. Both boys were taken by social services for treatment and psychological help at a children's institution. The state imprisoned the children away from their parents and their friends and community for years, and tried several times to make the separation permanent. Years later, because all the state efforts failed, and no foster parents could be found, the children were returned to their parents.  Criticism of the investigation and media reports  In Linda Kidane's documentary Mordet på Kevin, broadcast on Sveriges Radio on 2 October 2015, the investigation was presented as a complete success and Kidane confirmed that the two brothers had murdered Kevin Hjalmarsson. After Janne Josefsson and other journalists started to look into the case, the documentary was removed from Sveriges Radio's official website. In April 2017, Dagens Nyheter published an article that analysed the Kevin Case investigation. The article highlighted several faults in the initial investigation, such as how interrogations of the two boys were conducted and how the boys were led through the crime scene. The two boys were subjected to extensive interrogations; this was deemed counterproductive by experts on children since it could lead to false confessions. Among those with a critical view were psychology professor Ann-Christin Cederborg, who said that the interrogations of the two boys were conducted against all rules concerning how an interrogation should be conducted. According to Cederborg, the methods used on the boys produced false confessions. The two children were subjected to threats and rewards depending on what they answered during interrogations. Neither the boys nor their parents had any legal representation during the entire investigation and interrogations. The alleged confessions that led to the closing of the investigation were never recorded on audio or video. At the same time that Dagens Nyheter was investigating the case, a documentary by Dan Josefsson, Fallet Kevin, was in production. The documentary showed parts of the video interrogations with the boys. The first episode of the three-part documentary was broadcast on Sveriges Television on the Dokument inifrån show in 2017, a few weeks after Dagens Nyheter published their first article about the case. On 8 May, 2017, the district attorney decided to re-open the investigation into The Kevin Case. On 27 March, 2018, all suspicions against the two brothers were completely dismissed. Police also indicated that they now believed Kevin died of an accident.

History The union was founded in 1825 as the Manchester and Salford Trunk and Packing Case Makers' Friendly, Relief and Burial Society. Initially, all members had to have completed an apprenticeship in the trade, and to agree not to undertake piecework. Because most of the boxes made were for textile products, the union worked closely with those in the cotton trade, rather than other unions of woodworkers. Membership of the union remained very small for many years: only 161 in 1849, and 360 in 1899. It tried to broaden its membership base, becoming the Manchester, Salford and Bolton Wood Packing Case Makers' Society in 1892, and unsuccessfully trying to recruit workers in the trade on lower wages in both 1900 and 1905. These workers instead formed a rival Manchester and Salford Wood Packing Case Makers (No 2 Society), which finally merged into the original union in 1910. After World War I, the society again broadened its remit, accepting box makers from 1917, child workers from 1918, and workers undertaking piecework from 1919. This took membership over 1,000, and from 1918 the union was able to employ a full-time general secretary. The cotton industry declined in Lancashire throughout the 20th-century, and the union began recruiting more workers involved in making packaging for heavy engineering products, such workers making up 90% of the total by the 1970s. It also recruited palette makers and some people involved in other areas of woodwork, and in recognition of this adopted its final name in 1945. The union was still active in the mid-1980s, with around 500 members. In 1993, it merged into the Transport and General Workers' Union. General Secretaries :1970s: A.

They have been described for the first time in cytogenetic experiments dating from 1935 and, since this first observation, the term holocentric chromosome has referred to chromosomes that: i) they lack the primary constriction corresponding to centromere observed in monocentric chromosomes; and ii) they possess multiple kinetochores dispersed along the chromosomal axis so that microtubules bind to chromosomes along their entire length and move broadside to the pole from the metaphase plate. These chromosomes are also termed holokinetic, because, during cell division, chromatids move apart in parallel and do not form the classical V-shaped figures typical of monocentric chromosomes. Holocentric chromosomes evolved several times during both animal and plant evolution and are currently reported in about eight hundred diverse species, including plants, insects, arachnids and nematodes As a consequence of their diffuse kinetochores, holocentric chromosomes may stabilize chromosomal fragments favouring karyotype rearrangements. However, holocentric chromosome may also present limitations to crossing over causing a restriction of the number of chiasma in bivalents and may cause a restructuring of meiotic divisions resulting in an inverted meiosis.  Evolution  Holocentric chromosomes were described for the first time in 1935 to identify chromosomes with a diffuse kinetochore (or with a diffuse kinetochore activity) making these chromosomes able to bind to microtubules along their entire length. In the last decades, several studies assessed that the same behaviour during mitosis can be observed not only for holocentric/holokinetic chromosomes, but also for polykinetic chromosomes that contain numerous (but discrete) microtubule-binding sites, but the term “holocentric/holokinetic” is still used for both. In monocentric chromosomes, kinetochore (red circles) can be easily identified as it is located at the chromosomal primary constriction (centromere) during metaphase (M, top box). At anaphase (A, top box) chromatids move towards poles after their attachment to microtubules and V-shaped structures can be observed resulting from the passive movement of the chromosomal arms. In holocentric chromosome a chromosome-wide kinetochore is present (red lines) and no primary constriction is present during metaphase (M, bottom box). During anaphase (A, top box) holocentric chromatids move towards poles as linear bars parallel. If a chromosomal breakage occurs in a monocentric chromosome (bottom box), acentric chromosome fragments cannot be attached to microtubules during metaphase (M) and they are lost during anaphase (A). On the contrary, chromosome breakage of a holocentric chromosome results in chromosomal fragments that retain kinetic activity due to the chromosome-wide centromere extension and can be properly inherited. Before molecular methods became available, the presence of holocentric chromosomes was evaluated mostly using cytology and, considering that many species are difficult to study cytologically, it can be surmised that the true presence of holocentrism may be underestimated. In addition, there are several taxa, whose chromosomes are still uncharacterized, but their phylogenetic position suggests that they should have holocentric chromosomes. The presence of holocentric chromosomes has been up till now assessed in about 800 species, including insects, plants, arachnids, and nematodes suggesting that generally holocentric chromosomes originated by convergent evolution from ancestors possessing monocentric chromosomes. Interesting exceptions are represented by insects belonging to Oligoneoptera and Neoptera, whose monocentric chromosomes probably evolved from holocentric ancestor in two different and independent events. Evidence of convergent evolution suggests that holocentrism is adaptive, but the specific conditions under which holocentrism provided a selective advantage seem to be diverse for different taxa. Indeed, in phytophagous insects (such as aphids and lepidopterans) holocentrism could be related to the production by plants of compounds able to induce chromosomal breakages (clastogens), whereas in other cases, holocentrism allows facingDNA damage resulting from desiccation and/or other chromosome-breaking factors. Despite these differences, holocentric chromosomes present intrinsic benefits since chromosomal mutations, such as fissions and fusions, are potentially neutral in holocentric chromosomes in respect to monocentric ones. However, the hypothesis of holocentrism as an anticlastogenic adaptation have to be more systematically tested, including both controlled laboratory experiments and field studies across clastogenic gradients and large-scale phylogenetic analyses. At the same time, Nagaki et al. proposed that holocentrism can be easily acquired during plant and animal evolution by a slight difference in the kinetochore origin. In particular, they hypothesized that if the direction of kinetochore origin turns by 90° and occurs along the chromosome axes up to the telomeric regions, it is possible to “generate” holocentric chromosomes without any further step.  Structure  A detailed molecular analysis of the structure of holocentric chromosomes is currently available for the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans only, whereas the presence of true holokinetic nature has been also confirmed in other taxa by the evidence that experimentally induced chromosome fragments continue to attach to the spindle and segregate correctly. For most of the species, data about holocentrism are related to the analysis of the behaviour of chromosomes during anaphase migration since holocentric sister chromatids migrate in parallel to the spindle poles, in contrast to monocentric ones in which pulling forces are exerted on a single chromosomal point and chromosome arms trail behind. As a consequence, chromatids of holocentric chromosomes move apart in parallel and do not form the classical V-shaped figures typical of monocentric ones. Moreover, if a holocentric chromosome is fragmented (for instance by X-ray irradiation), each fragment retains centromere activity and can segregate properly to the poles.  In different organisms  = Arthropods = Among arthropods, the presence of holocentric chromosome has been reported in different species belonging to insects (Odonata, Zoraptera, Dermaptera, Psocoptera, Phthiraptera, Thysanoptera, Hemiptera, Trichoptera and Lepidoptera), scorpions (Buthoidea), mites and ticks of the superorder Acariformes and genus Rhipicephalus (Ixodidae), spiders (Dysderidae and Segestridae), millipedes and centipedes. Despite this widespread occurrence, most of the currently available data on holocentrism is related to aphid and lepidopteran species. In aphids, holocentric chromosomes have been deeply studied and their ability to stabilize chromosomal fragments has been associated to their phytophagous life style. Indeed, several plants produce chemicals able to induce DNA damage to pest insects. Nicotine, for instance, is a naturally occurring alkaloid found primarily in members of the solanaceous plant family (including Nicotiana tabacum) that can cause replication fork stress resulting in various forms of DNA damage, including chromosomal fragmentations. Similar effects have been also reported by other plant-produced molecules, such as caffeine and ethanol. In view of their ability to favour the inheritance of chromosomal fragments, holocentrism has been associated to recurrent changes in the karyotypes of some aphid species and in particular in the peach potato aphid Myzus persicae, where both inter- and intra-individual rearranged karyotypes have been also observed. Interestingly, aphids also possess a constitutive expression of the telomerase coding gene so that they can initiate a de novo synthesis of telomere sequences at internal breakpoints, resulting in the stabilization of chromosomal fragments. Among non-polyploid animals, Lepidoptera exhibit the highest variance in chromosome number between species within a genus and notable levels of interspecific and intraspecific karyotype variability. Lepidoptera indeed tolerate chromosomal variations in view of their holokinetic chromosomes, which facilitate the successful inheritance of novel fission or fusion fragments. As a consequence, Lepidoptera can avoid the deleterious consequences of large-scale chromosomal fission and fusion. Nevertheless, they can sometimes tolerate heterozygosity for multiple rearrangements in hybrids between population with differences in their karyotype, raising questions about additional mechanisms that rescue fertility in chromosomal hybrids. In Lepidoptera, therefore, chromosome evolution is believed to play a role in reinforcing speciation. Comparing the genomes of lepidopteran species it has been also possible to analyse the effect of holocentrism in terms of rate of fixed chromosomal rearrangements. This approach evidenced in Lepidoptera two chromosome breaks per megabase of DNA per Million of years: a rate that is much higher than what observed in Drosophila and it is a direct consequence of the holocentric nature of the lepidopteran genomes. At a structural level, insect holocentric chromosomes have not been studied in details, but it is interesting to underline the absence of homologues of CENP-C and CENP-A, previously considered essential for kinetochore functioning in eukaryotes. = Nematodes = The best known group of holocentric species can be found in the Secernentea class of the nematodes, which includes C. elegans. other nematodes are usually described as holocentric because of their phylogenetic relationship to C. elegans, but real karyotypic evidences are scarce or controversial. Nematode development is typically characterized by fixed lineages and a single inappropriate cell death, therefore, it has been suggested that holocentrism could avoid the disastrous consequences of unrepaired chromosome breakage events. The availability of several molecular and genomic resources allowed a detailed characterization of C. elegans holocentric chromosomes and in particular the structure of the kinetochore has been molecularly dissected. Current data suggest that C. elegans kinetochores form paired lines or plates on opposite faces of condensed mitotic chromosomes, where each line represents the diffuse kinetochore of a single chromatid. transmission electron microscopy of C. elegans chromosomes revealed that the kinetochore has a trilaminar structure very similar to that observed in monocentric chromosomes More than 30 different proteins have been identified as components of the C. elegans kinetochore and half of them was already known as functioning in the kinetochores of monocentric chromosomes. Among these, highly studied proteins include homologues of CENP-C and CENP-A, which are highly conserved structural component of the kinetochore in eukaryotes. Contrarily to what generally observed in monocentric chromosomes, in holocentric ones the preferential localization of centromeres within heterochromatic areas is missing together with the presence of specific DNA sequences that in C. elegans are not required for the assembly of a functional kinetochore. In this regard, it has been observed that holocentric chromosomes of nematodes are unique because they have a large number of satellites scattered throughout their genome, whereas no scattered satellites are found in the monocentric chromosomes of the nematode trichinella spiralis. Interestingly, these satellite DNAs are not conserved in their sequences among species suggesting that highly repetitive DNAs may facilitate the formation of kinetochores in view of their repetitiveness rather than for their specific sequence. The absence of a localized centromere prompted several studies to identify proteins that are involved in the sister chromatid cohesion assessing that it is accomplished by a separate complex of conserved proteins, termed cohesin, that is composed of the core subunits Scc3, Smc1, Smc3 and Scc1. Interestingly, they play the same function in organisms with monocentric chromosomes with an exception related to the subunit Scc1, whose gene in addition to the Scc1 orthologue present three additional paralogous genes. = Plants = In plants, holocentric chromosomes have been found in zygnematophycean algae, in the genera Myristica (Myristicaceae), Chionographis (Melanthiaceae), Cuscuta (Convolvulaceae) and Droseraceae, in the species trithuria submersa (hydatellaceae), prionium serratum (thurniaceae) and, among higher-plants, in many genera belonging to families cyperaceae and juncaceae, including the snowy woodrush luzula nivea (juncaceae), the most well-studied holocentric plant. In Luzula spp, the centromeric activity is localized simultaneously at several evenly spaced sites along each chromosome and chromosomes can be fragmented naturally or by irradiation into smaller (but viable) chromosomes. The presence of rearranged karyotype does not affect fitness, as assessed by studies reporting that Luzula hybrids with parents possessing smaller and larger chromosomes showed the smaller chromosomes aligned and paired with the larger ones. Similarly, in plants belonging to the genus Carex, differentiation of the karyotype has been demonstrated to correlate with genetic divergence within species, among populations within species and within populations suggesting that, as previously reported in Lepidoptera, holocentric chromosome rearrangements contribute to genetic differentiation at different evolutionary scales in Carex evolution and speciation. In plants it has also been suggested that the diffuse kinetochore of holocentric chromosomes may suppress the meiotic drive of centromeric repeats and its negative consequences. In particular, the expansions (or contractions) of centromeric repeats may lead to a larger (or smaller) kinetochore, which attracts more (or fewer) microtubules during meiosis. This hypothesis, which correlates the presence of holocentric chromosomes with centromere drive suppression, is very intriguing but it only explains the evolution of chromosomal holocentrism in meiosis and not in mitosis and this is not trivial considering that some species with holocentric chromosomes may present a restriction of kinetochore activity during meiosis. Similarly to what previously reported for C. elegans, in L. elegans centromeres are not made by centromere-associated retrotransposons nor centromere-associated satellite DNAs, but cenH3 proteins seem to be associated with a centromere-specific chromatin folding rather than with specific centromeric DNA sequences. Conservation of elements between mono- and holocentric chromosomes is not limited to centromeric proteins, but it is also extended to epigenetic marks. Indeed, the cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation of serine 10 or serine 28 of H3 (that is typically enriched in peri- centromeric regions of monocentric plant chromosomes) occurs uniformly along the Luzula chromosomes. As previously described in aphids, L. elegans possesses a rapid and efficient de novo telomere formation based on a telomerase-mediated healing process that is active immediately after chromosomal damage by irradiation of chromosomes. Newly formed telomere repeats were cytologically detectable 21 days after irradiation in about 50% of cases with a complete healing of telomere after 3 months favouring the fragment stabilization and karyotype fixation.  Meiosis  In the late 19th century, van Beneden (1883) and Boveri (1890) described meiosis for the first time through a careful observation of germ cell formation in the nematode Ascaris. These observations, together with several further analyses, evidenced that canonical meiosis consists of a first division (called reductional division) that involves the segregation of chromosomal homologs resulting in the reduction of chromosome number and a second division (defined equational division) consisting in the separation of sister chromatids. A general rule for meiosis is therefore: first homologues, then sisters. Schematic comparison of the chromosomal separation occurring during the first meiotic division in standard and inverted meiosis. However, the understanding of the reductional division in meiosis of Ascaris sp. has been obtained studying the holocentric chromosomes which, in many other taxa, follow a reverse order of meiotic division. Indeed, as reported in several nematodes, in insects belonging to Hemiptera and Lepidoptera, in mites and in some flowering plants species with holocentric chromosomes generally present an inverted meiotic sequence, in which segregation of homologs is postponed until the second meiotic division. Furthermore, in most cases of inverted meiosis the absence of a canonical kinetochore structure has been observed, together with a restriction of the kinetic activity to the chromosomal ends. These changes are related to the peculiar cohesion occurring in tetrads of the holocentric homologous chromosomes during meiosis that impose obstacles to the releases of chromosomes involved in multiple crossing over events. In the holocentric chromosomes of C. elegans female meiosis, this problem is circumvented restricting crossing over to form only a single chiasma per bivalent and triggering the redistribution of kinetochore proteins along the bivalent axis forming meiosis-specific cup-like structures that uniformly coat each half bivalent but are excluded from the midbivalent region. During anaphase I, C. elegans homologous chromosomes are segregated to the poles by microtubule pushing from the midbivalent regions towards the poles. Differently to what reported in C. elegans, other organisms with holocentric chromosomes, including both plants and insects, circumvent this problem segregating sister chromatids during meiosis I leading to the term inverted meiosis in which the order of reductional and equational division is inverted in respect to canonical meiosis. In this case therefore the separation of homologous chromosomes follows the segregation of sister chromatids. However, in order to have a successful inverted meiosis, it is necessary that a bipolar orientation of sister kinetochores occurs, together with their attachment to microtubules from opposite spindle poles in meiosis I. This allows the segregation of sister chromatids to opposite poles in anaphase I (equational division), but it requests a mechanism to align and pair homologous chromosomes during the second meiotic division. Interestingly, the presence of inverted meiosis can also facilitate the proper chromosome segregation in hybrids from parental species with differences in their karyotypes or derived by populations with rearranged karyotype allowing rescue of the fertility and viability of hybrids and promoting a fast karyotype evolution and possibly chromosomal speciation, as reported in Lepidoptera.

She is also remembered for the textile works she created with her husband Lars Johanson which were exhibited in Gothenburg in 1970. Biography Born on 24 July 1926 in Stockholm, Edit Gunilla Margareta Lagerbielke was the daughter of Ernst Gustaf Lagerbjelke (1897–1932) and Signe Margaretha Hamilton (1902–1989). After her well-to-do father died when she was only five, she was brought up by her mother in the centre of Stockholm. On matriculating from the girls high school, she studied textile art at the college which soon became known as Konstfackskolan. From 1951 to 1956, Lagerbielke taught textile art at the Arts and Crafts School in Copenhagen. Thanks to a grant from the Swedish- America Foundation, she then went on a nine-month study trip to the United States with her newly-wedded husband, Lars Johanson, whom she had met while studying at Konstfack. On returning to Sweden, they worked together as Lars and Gunilla Johanson, presenting a large exhibition of their work in 1970 at the Röhsska Museum in Gothenburg titled \\"Textila bilder och figurer\\" (Textile Pictures and Figures). Her marriage did not survive as Johanson became increasingly dominant, preventing her from creating her own works. After their divorce in 1975, Lagerbielke found a position with the Stockholm Lekmiljörådet (Play Environment Council) where she developed support for pre-school children, later heading the department (1972–78). In 1978, she was appointed rector of Konstfack, where she remained for the next twelve years. Thereafter she received many government assignments, including the modernization of art colleges and the development of art in public places. In the 1990s, she became deputy head of the Swedish Art Grants Committee and head of the Swedish Visual Arts Foundation. In particular, she was effective in developing a more international approach to the work of these bodies, improving Sweden's worldwide image. In later life, Lagerbielke returned to textile art, this time creating embroidery designs. She exhibited at the Galleri Inger Molin in 2004, 2006 and 2012. Gunilla Lagerbielke died in Stockholm on 15 August 2013. She is survived by her daughter Erika Lagerbielke (born 1960), a designer who works mainly with glass.

He was Senator for Corsica from 1892 to 1894, and again from 1903 to 1904. Early years (1835–92) Ange-Marie Muracciole was born on 12 March 1835 in Muracciole, Corsica. His parents were Bartolomeo Muracciole (1808–58) and Maria Costa. On 19 January 1858 he married Madeleine Pantalacci (born 1838) in Muracciole. Muracciole became a public works contractor. He had gained a solid reputation when work began on the Panama Canal in 1881, and was invited to participate. He returned to Corsica when the work was suspended. He was mayor of Belgodère and general councilor of Vezzani. On 29 July 1886 his second marriage was to Rose Marie Casanelli d'Istria (1864–1931) in Muracciole. Senator (1892–94) On 21 August 1892 Muracciole ran for election to the Senate in a by-election following the death of François Morelli. He was elected in the first round by 382 votes against 372 for Vincent Farinole. He joined the democratic left group. Due to illness he was forced to seek leave in 1892 before speaking in the senate. In the general elections of 7 January 1894 he was defeated by Farinole, who won 409 votes to 272 for Muracciole. Later career (1894–1904) Muracciole returned to private life, running his business and acting in his local political posts. The journal Le Républicain (Bastia), founded as a daily in 1895, reappeared on 12 April 1898 to support the Republican candidates Emmanuel Arène, Muracciole, Marius Giacobbi, Colonel Astima and Toussain Malaspina in the 8 May 1898 legislative elections. In 1901 Muracciole became general councilor for the canton of Vico, replacing Dominique Cristinacce. He was also a censor at the Ajjacio branch of the Bank of France. Muracciole ran once more for election to the senate on 4 January 1903, and decisively defeated Farinole by 581 votes to 113. His health again prevented him from spending much time in the Senate. He died in office on 2 July 1904 in Ajaccio at the age of 69. The village of Muracciole is distinguished by a Gothic Revival château built in the late 19th century by Ange Muracciole. It is a rare example of this type of architecture on Corsica. The house was built by Muracciole after he returned from the Panama Canal. The village also has a funeral chapel for his family.

In June 2016, Kuczynski won over Keiko Fujimori of Popular Force with 8,596,937 votes, 50.12 percent of the votes. However, in those same elections, she achieved a majority in the Congress while that the ruling group of Peruanos Por el Kambio drew a few congressmen. From the beginning, the relations between the Legislative and the Executive were strained, and on September 15, 2017 the Congress denied the vote of confidence to the then president of the Council of Ministers Fernando Zavala, with which Kuczynski had to appoint a new cabinet. This included five new ministers, and was chaired by the second vice president and also congresswoman Mercedes Aráoz Fernández. His government has also been marked by the Odebrecht case. Kuczynski himself was the subject of a vacancy request in Congress for its conflicts of interest with that company, which in a first attempt did not prosper. Soon after, it pardoned former President Alberto Fujimori, who was serving a 25-year sentence for crimes against humanity. The decision triggered protests in Lima and eight other cities as well as the resignation of three of its ministers and the criticism of a broad spectrum of personalities. In a national political crisis, which finally led to a second process of presidential vacancy, promoted by the left and supported by the Fujimoristas of Popular Force. But a few days before the Congress debated the vacancy request, the Fujimoristas revealed videos and audios that showed that government operators, including a minister of state, were negotiating with a Popular Force congressman to buy their vote against the government vacancy, in exchange for works for your region. The next day, the president sent his letter of resignation to Congress, which was accepted on March 23, 2018. That same day the engineer Martín Vizcarra was sworn in as new president, for being in the line of succession as he was the first vice president of the Republic.  Transition period  The second round of voting took place on June 5, 2016, which Kuczynski won by a narrow margin. A few days after the ballot, he confirmed that Alfredo Thorne Vetter would assume the position of Minister of Economy and Finance. On June 28, the National Elections Board presented the credentials of Kuczynski as president and Martín Vizcarra and Mercedes Aráoz as vice-presidents, in a ceremony held at the Municipal Theater of Lima. On Sunday, July 10, he announced that Fernando Zavala Lombardi would be the president of the Council of Ministers and days later, both announced the members of the first ministerial cabinet.  Tenure of power  The inauguration ceremony was held on July 28, 2016, at the Legislative Palace. It counted with the presence of King Juan Carlos I of Spain, the Latin American presidents: Mauricio Macri, Horacio Cartes, Michelle Bachelet, Enrique Peña Nieto, Juan Manuel Santos and Rafael Correa; Vice presidents Alvaro Garcia Linera, Raúl Fernando Sendic, Óscar Ortiz Ascencio and Jafeth Cabrera Franco; the Brazilian Foreign Minister, José Serra. Among the international delegations was the US Trade Representative, Michael Froman, along with the Assistant Secretary of State for Latin America, Mari Carmen Aponte, and the Assistant Secretary of State for Security Affairs, William Brownfield; also the former Japanese economy minister, Toshihiro Nikai. In his first speech given to the nation from the headquarters of the National Congress, Kuczynski presented six topics, which, in his view, were of an urgent nature: water and drainage for all Peruvians, quality Public Education, service of public health sensitive to the patient, formalize the country, build infrastructure and development, and complete intolerance for corruption, discrimination, and crime.

The swearing-in, unlike previous occasions in which it had been held in the Golden Hall of the Government Palace, was held this time in the courtyard of honor, outdoors and in full view of the public. The ministerial cabinet consisted of: Fernando Zavala (Prime minister); Víctor Ricardo Luna Mendoza (Foreign Affairs); Mariano González Fernández (Defense); Alfredo Thorne (Economy and Finance); Carlos Basombrío Iglesias (Interior); Marisol Pérez Tello (Justice and Human Rights); Jaime Saavedra (Education); Patricia García Funegra (Health); José Manuel Hernández Calderón (Agriculture and Irrigation); Alfonso Grados Carraro (Labour); Bruno Giuffra (Production); Eduardo Ferreyros Küppers (Foreign Trade and Tourism); Gonzalo Tamayo (Energy and Mines); Martín Vizcarra (Transport and Communications); Edmer Trujillo Mori (Housing, Construction and Sanitation); Ana María Romero-Lozada (Woman and Vulnerable Populations); Elsa Galarza (Environment); Jorge Nieto Montesinos (Culture); and Cayetana Aljovín (Development and Social Inclusion). Of the members of the cabinet, six were economists (Zavala, Thorne, Saavedra, Tamayo, Giuffra and Galarza). Some of them had previously held a ministerial position: Zavala had been head of the economy in 2005–2006 during the mandate of Alejandro Toledo; Romero-Lozada was Minister of Women twice, also during the mandate of Alejandro Toledo; Ferreyros was in Foreign Trade in 2010 (during Alan García's second tenure); and Saavedra was Minister of Education since 2013 (during Ollanta Humala's mandate. On the other hand, the lack of equity in terms of gender was questioned, since it was made up of 14 men and 5 women. = Vote of confidence = Prime Minister Fernando Zavala, head of Kuczynski's first ministerial cabinet. On August 18, 2016, Prime Minister Fernando Zavala appeared before the plenary of the Congress of the Republic of Peru to request a vote of confidence from his cabinet, in accordance with the constitutional norm. In a speech that lasted two hours, he presented in four blocks the main issues to consider: opportunities, social investment, water and infrastructure; citizen security and fight against corruption; employment, formalization and reactivation of the economy; and bringing the state closer to the citizen. He highlighted the progress made by each of the last five governments, including that of Alberto Fujimori. Although there were doubts that a Congress, which had an absolute majority opposed to the government (represented by the 73 members of Popular Force of a total of 130) could easily grant the vote of confidence, after a long debate that lasted 21 hours, it was approved, with 121 votes in favor, 2 against and one abstention. = Granting of legislative powers = Another moment of tension between the Executive and the Congress came when the former asked the latter to grant powers to legislate on economic matters, citizen security, anti-corruption, water and sanitation, and the reorganization of Petroperú. On September 30, 2016, after a six-hour debate, Congress granted the Executive Branch legislative powers for a term of 90 days. Voting was done by topic and not by block. On January 7, 2017, at the expiration of the 90-day period, Prime Minister Zavala announced the publication of 112 legislative decrees. = Bribery scandal = Carlos Moreno served as Presidential Adviser on health issues since the beginning of the government. He was, apparently, a very trustworthy person of Kuczynski. So, when he resigned on October 4, 2016, he caught the attention of the media. Kuczynski said at first that the resignation of his advisor was due to personal reasons and his heavy workload. However, Moreno himself explained that the reason was because they had recorded their conversations in the Government Palace and that they were involved in a corruption case. On October 9, the television program Cuarto Poder broadcast an audio in which Moreno commented on negotiation for a clinic to sign an agreement with the Archbishopric of Lima and, thus, be able to access an agreement to serve patients insured in the System Integral de Salud (SIS). \\"It's the negotiation, I have the people who do it, I have the patients,\\" Moreno said, as heard in the audio record. \\"That is our mine. You do not know how much money we are going to win,\\" he added. Although Moreno was separated from the government as soon as the \\"negotiation\\" was exposed, the scandal shook an administration that was barely three months since initiation. = Resignation of Minister Mariano Gonzalez = Minister Mariano Gonzalez On November 27, 2016, a report from a news program revealed that Defense Minister Cosme Mariano González Fernández maintained a sentimental relationship with an advisor from his office, which he presumably had favored with a promotion. The minister denied having favored his partner and said in his defense: \\"What I have committed is a fact of love. I have fallen in love.\\" The next day, González submitted his resignation to the position, which was accepted by Prime Minister Zavala. A week later, he was appointed as Jorge Nieto Montesinos, until then head of the Ministry of Culture headed by the actor and film director Salvador del Solar. = Censorship of Minister Jaime Saavedra = Education minister Jaime Saavedra, who held that position since the Humala administration in 2013, was censored by Congress and forced to resign. The opposition to the government, represented in the Congress by an overwhelming Fujimorist majority allied with the APRA party, began to question the work of the Minister of Education, Jaime Saavedra. First, it was related to the organization of the 2019 Panamerican Games in Lima, despite having been announced in 2013 (shortly before taking office as minister), not enough had been done in terms of infrastructure construction. Then, a Sunday television program launched a report in which he denounced that the minister's trusted staff had made a deviation from a budget of 150 million soles destined for the purchase of computers. The opposition in Congress announced that it would interpellate the minister to demand that he give an account of his administration, particularly in relation to the alleged corruption. President Kuczynski publicly supported his minister and argued that the campaign against him originated with a group of legislators associated with private universities who wanted to make changes in the University Law to favor their interests. On December 7, 2016, Saavedra was questioned at the Congress, whose campus he voluntarily attended to answer a list of 11 questions. After eleven hours of exhibitions and debate, in which the minister accepted that there were irregularities in the purchases made by his sector by people who had \\"betrayed his trust\\", the Fujimorist block announced that it would submit a motion of censure against the minister, because, to his see, he was politically responsible and had not responded satisfactorily to the interpellatory statement. Saavedra told the press that he would not resign before the censorship request. On December 15, the minister's censorship debate was held, obtaining as a final result 78 votes in favor, none against and no abstention (due to the fact that the benches of Peruvians for Change and Open Front, against the censorship, they retired of the hemicycle before the voting). Saavedra was given a period of 72 hours to present his resignation letter. On December 17, Saavedra resigned and the following day she was sworn in by educator Marilú Martens. = Secret bilateral meetings between Pedro Pablo Kuczynski and Keiko Fujimori = Keiko Fujimori In December 2016, following an initiative by Cardinal Juan Luis Cipriani, the leader of Popular Force, Keiko Fujimori, and President Kuczynski met to talk at the archbishop's residence. A similar meeting took place in July 2017, after Fujimori invited the president to talk. This time, the meeting took place at the Government Palace. In view of the subsequent events, the second vice-president Mercedes Aráoz considered that it was an error to believe in Fujimori's demands for dialogue, since, apparently, since the first moment his intention had been to undermine the government and seek the vacancy of the president. = Interpellation of Minister Martin Vizcarra = After months of study, the government decided to carry out the project of the construction of the International Airport of Chinchero, signing on February 3, 2017 an addendum to contract modifications with Kuntur Wasi, the consortium had won the award the project in 2014. This was a work that had decades of waiting and was longed for by the people of Cusco, who threatened to get up if it were paralyzed; it seems that the political and social solution prevailed more on the part of the government than on technical issues. President Kuczynski and the Minister of Transport and Communications Martín Vizcarra defended the addendum, stating that it was the best option for the State and citizens. It was argued that the State saved $590 million (which was the amount of debt that was held with the company). Minister Vizcarra However, since the Congress, specifically on behalf of Congressman Víctor Andrés García Belaunde, a vehement opposition arose, considering the addendum as harmful to the interests of the State. A photo published in the Correo newspaper, dating from June 2016, showed Vizcarra in a thankful meeting of the Peruanos Por el Kambio party for the contributors to his campaign, where Carlos Vargas Loret de Mola, president of the Kuntur Wasi consortium, appears. For Garcia Belaunde, that would be the link that would explain the alleged government favoritism toward consortium, so it Vizcarra branded as a \\"traitor\\" and demanded his resignation. Harassed by critics, Vizcarra said that the state would no outlay of money to Kuntuhuasi to wait for the final report. On March 1, 2017, Popular Action presented a statement against Vizcarra, seconded by representatives of Popular Force, Frente Amplio and the APRA. However, following the onslaught of El Nino, in which some parliamentarians moved to the affected areas to care for the victims, Congress decided to suspend \\"until further notice\\" the interpellation to Vizcarra, which was scheduled for March 23 and consisted of 83 questions. Amended the El Niño phenomenon, on May 5, a group of 35 congressmen presented a new motion to question the minister. On May 11, the motion was approved with 71 votes and the interpellation was scheduled for May 18, 48 in which the minister answered a list of 83 questions for more than three hours. In the Congress, it was agreed to wait for the report of the Comptroller's Office, indicated for Monday, before proceeding to the vote of censorship. But before that happened, Vizcarra submitted his resignation as minister, after announcing in a television interview that he was going to cancel the contract and the addendum for the construction of the Chinchero airport, in view of not having had acceptance in the Congress or the Comptroller's Office. Indeed, moments later, the comptroller general Edgar Alarcon presented his report on the contract Chinchero where recommended legal action against ten officials (six of MTC, two of the MEF and two Ositran) for alleged irregularities in the addendum for the company Kuntur Wasi. With Vizcarra, there were already two ministers who left office by Congress in less than a year, after being questioned (the other was Saavedra in Education); What's more, it was the most prestigious government ministers. For this reason, Zavala criticized the majority caucus in the Congress (of Fujimorism), arguing that \\"one thing is political control, another is the abuse of power. It is one thing to control, another is to obstruct. \\" Succeeding as the First Vice President of Peru and following after Kuczynski's resignation, Vizcarra assumed the Presidency of Peru. Vizcarra has mentioned that he will get his revenge soon. = Ministerial changes (May 2017) = On May 25, 2017, Bruno Giuffra, who until then was the Minister of Production, left that position and swore as Minister of Transport and Communications, replacing Martín Vizcarra. While the official congressman Pedro Olaechea happened to occupy the Ministry of the Production. The swearing-in ceremony of both was held in the Golden Hall of the Government Palace. = Audio Thorne-Alarcón = On May 28, 2017 the television program Panorama revealed some transcripts of an audio in which the Minister of Economy Alfredo Thorne was holding a conversation with the Comptroller General of the Republic Edgar Alarcón, dated May 17, days before the delivery of the report of the Comptroller on the addendum to the Chinchero Airport contract. On June 4, some excerpts of the audio were published, and later, on the claim that it was being published in a biased manner, it was published in full, on June 11. In this conversation, the interlocutors talk about additional funds for the Comptroller's Office that should be approved by the Ministry of Economy, and about the report that the Comptroller was about to draw on the Chinchero Contract. In a part of it we hear that Thorne tells Alarcón: \\"Now everything depends on you: if Chinchero passes, we are doing well; if Chinchero is taken down, it is going but badly \\". After the audio was broadcast, Thorne was accused of exerting political pressure on the comptroller on behalf of the Executive, conditioning the increase in the budget of the Comptroller's Office in exchange for a positive report in what refers to Chinchero. The plenary session of the Congress, held on June 15 (that is, several days after the announcement of the audio), summoned Thorne to appear urgently in the floor to give his explanations about his conversations with the comptroller. But the minister excused himself from attending his busy work schedule, announcing that he would attend the Congress's oversight committee on June 16, as scheduled. Given this, the chairman of the audit committee, Hector Becerril, announced that the summons to the said working group was without effect and that only his immediate presence was expected before the plenary session of the Congress, and that in case of not attending, it could be cause for censorship. Thorne then confirmed his attendance at the Congress on the 16th, where he made an exhibition that lasted ten minutes. He denied the accusation of conditioning the budget increase of the Comptroller's Office in exchange for a positive report on the Chinchero contract, and unless President Kuczynski had instructed him to condition the comptroller. After a debate among the congressmen, the opposition caucuses they raised the minister to renounce his position; otherwise, they would promote a motion of censure against him. On June 19, Thorne formalized before Congress a question of confidence to continue in office, something he had requested in his speech on the 16th. The issue of trust was debated on June 21 by the full Congress, where the caucuses of Popular Force, APRA, Acción Popular, Frente Amplio and Alliance for Progress voted against, adding 88 votes in total. There were only 11 votes in favor of giving him the confidence (of the members of the ruling party) and 2 abstentions. Before this, Thorne resigned from the Ministry of Economy, being replaced by Prime Minister Fernando Zavala, who was sworn in the following day, although his role as president of the Council of Ministers. = Interpellation of Minister Basombrío = On June 21, 2017, Interior Minister Carlos Basombrío Iglesias appeared before the full Congress to answer the interpellatory list of 39 questions. This occurred immediately after Congress denied confidence to Minister Thorne. The exhibition of Basombrío lasted three hours and not only answered the questions, but made announcements about his management. Once the presentation was over, the parliamentary debate began and continued until the following day. Although the opposition groups to the government questioned some of their responses, none raised their censure nor asked for their resignation. = Ministerial changes (July 2017) = On July 27, 2017, three changes were made official in the ministerial cabinet: the government congresswoman Ana María Choquehuanca assumed the Ministry of Women; Until then Minister of Development and Social Inclusion Cayetana Aljovín became the owner of Energy and Mines; while Fiorella Molinelli was appointed Minister of Development and Social Inclusion. The appointment of the latter generated some criticism from the opposition in Congress, because as an official of the Ministry of Transport and Communications had signed the contract addendum for the construction of the Chinchero airport. = Second \\"Address to the Nation\\" = On July 28, 2017, after one year of the government, it began celebrating the traditional Mass and Te Deum in the Cathedral of Lima; After that, the president arrived at the headquarters of the Congress, where he gave his second message to the nation, for national holidays, which lasted an hour and 15 minutes. According to the Political Constitution, the president on this date must give a message to the nation in which to account for what has been done and present their future plans. Kuczynski began by mentioning the most serious problems he faced during his first year in office, such as the El Niño Costero disaster and the Lava Jato scandal, which cost 2% of GDP. He emphasized that National Reconstruction will boost the national economy. It also presented five bills, which address the obtaining of buildings required for the execution of infrastructure works; the creation of an urban transport authority for Lima and Callao; the reform of the conformation and requirements to be a member of the National Council of the Magistracy; the promotion of projects for wastewater treatment through public-private partnerships; and the strengthening of the labor inspection system through Sunafil. Contrary to the message given at the beginning of his mandate, his second message to the nation was received with little expectation and disbelief among several of the leading political and economic analysts. After the message, Kuczynski walked to the Government Palace, where he was held a tribute to the people who helped during the disaster caused by the coastal El Nino. = Interpellation of Minister Martens and the cabinet crisis = On August 17, 2017 the congresspeople of Popular Force filed a motion of interpretation against the Minister of Education Marilú Martens who was in negotiations with the representatives of the teachers, in search of the solution to a prolonged teacher strike. On August 25, 2017 the plenary session of the Congress of the Republic approved, with 79 votes in favor, 12 against and 6 abstentions, to make said interpellation . The votes in favor were from the bench of Popular Force, APRA, Frente Amplio and Acción Popular. It was set as the date of the interpellation on September 8. The minister responded to a list of 40 questions, mainly about the teachers 'strike that still persisted. Martens acknowledged deficiencies in facing the teachers' strike, but assured that his management would not reverse the recognition of meritocracy within the teaching profession. On September 13, the Popular Force bench announced that it would submit a motion of censure against the minister, as it considered that it had not responded satisfactorily to the questions of interpellation. Faced with this threat of censorship (which would be the second against an Education minister in less than a year), Prime Minister Fernando Zavala asked Congress for a question of confidence for the full ministerial cabinet; in other words, a renewal of the vote of confidence that had been given to him at the beginning of his administration. From the Congress this request was criticized, pointing out the fact that Zavala showed solidarity with a minister who was questioned, endangering her entire cabinet, and even more so, when the motion of censure had not yet been made official. It was also said that the \\"renewal of trust\\" was something that the Constitution did not contemplate. But anyway, the Board of Spokespersons of the Congress summoned Zavala at four o'clock on the afternoon of September 14 to support her request for confidence. Zavala presented himself to the plenary session of the Congress with the ministers and presented his request in 12 minutes; his argument focused on the government's intention to defend the educational policy that was intended, according to him, to undermine the education minister's censure. Then came the parliamentary debate. The question of trust was debated for 7 hours and voted on at dawn on the 15th. There were 77 parliamentarians who voted against Zavala's request, while 22 supported it and 16 abstained. Kenji Fujimori was the only one of the 71 representatives of Popular Force who adhered to the request for trust. All the others opposed. The representatives of the Broad Front also voted against the confidence. Thus the crisis of the cabinet occurred. Members of Popular Force considered that all the members of the cabinet had to resign, but finally the opinion prevailed that only the prime minister was obliged to resign, and that the rest of the ministers could remain, except those who were questioned, as was the case of Minister Martens. = Second cabinet minister (Aráoz) = On September 17, 2017, the second vice president and congresswoman Mercedes Aráoz Fernández was sworn in as President of the Council of Ministers of Peru and with it joined five new ministers: Claudia Cooper Fort (Economy), Idel Vexler (Education), Enrique Mendoza Ramírez (Justice and Human Rights), Fernando D'Alessio (Health) and Carlos Bruce (Housing). The new head of the cabinet was sworn in with the 18 ministers in a ceremony held in the Court of Honor of the Government Palace. On October 12, Mercedes Aráoz appeared before the plenary session of the Congress to request a vote of confidence from her ministerial cabinet. His exhibition lasted two hours. After a parliamentary debate that lasted until one o'clock in the morning of the following day, 83 congressmen (from the opposing blocs of Popular Force, Alianza para el Progreso, Partido Aprista Peruano and Acción Popular, voted in favor of the motion of confidence). as of the official Peruanos Por el Kambio) and against 17 (of Frente Amplio and the nascent New Peru bench). The next step for the Executive will be to request legislative powers from the Congress, set for December 7, 2017. = First process to impeach the president = On December 13, 2017, Lava Jato Commission President Rosa Bartra released information from the Odebrecht company in which it claimed that Westfield Capital, an investment banking advisory firm, founded and directed by Kuczynski had carried out seven consultancies for Odebrecht between November 2004 and December 2007 for 782,207 million dollars, that is, coinciding with the time when Kuczynski had been Minister of Economy (2004–2005) and President of the Council of Ministers (2005–2006). The information also revealed that another company, First Capital, constituted by the Chilean Gerardo Sepúlveda (partner of Kuczynski), He had done advisory services for Odebrecht between 2005 and 2013, receiving US$4,043,941 as payment for his services. It was also known that both advisory firms shared the same tax address. The information was seriously compromising for the president, who had always denied having had relations with the Odebrecht company, and because the payments to his personal consulting company had been made when he was Minister of State (something prohibited by constitutional norm for typifying conflict of interest), and even worse when they came from a company like Odebrecht, which had paid bribes to win the concession of works precisely under the government of Toledo, when Kuczynski had been minister. The president then announced that he would receive the Lava Jato Commission on December 22, but this gesture was considered delayed, after repeatedly insisting on responding only in writing. Opposition to the government, led by Popular Force, demanded the resignation of Kuczynski. and threatened to kick him out of the presidency if he did not. Frente Amplio, on the other hand, stated that the vacancy should proceed directly. At midnight on December 14, he denied the accusations and said he would not resign his position. \\"I am here to tell you: I am not going to abdicate to my honor or my values or my responsibilities as president of all Peruvians,\\" he said in a message to the nation. In his defense, he assured that he had no relationship with the company. First Capital, which was the exclusive property of Sepúlveda, and that only one of the payments mentioned had to do with him, the one dated in 2012, when he was no longer Minister of State; and that regarding Westfield Capital, although he recognized that it was his sole proprietorship, he affirmed that he was never under his direction and administration while he was Minister of State, and that the contracts dated at that time had been signed by Sepúlveda, his partner. He also pointed out that all payments to his company were legal, duly registered, billed and banked. Kuczynski's explanations did not convince the opposition, and he was accused of continuing to lie, especially in relation to the fact that he had left Westfield. Capital when he was minister, when, according to public records, he always figured as the director of that company. In this regard, Kuczynski argued in its defense the concept of the \\"Chinese wall\\", expression used in business to refer to when the partner or owner has no contact or receive information about the management of the company. But this argument did not convince its opponents either, since being a sole proprietorship, there was no way that it would have remained alien to the management of it. Faced with the refusal of the president to resign, several of the opposition caucuses of the Congress then proposed to submit their position to the vacancy. The Frente Amplio filed a motion to request the vacancy to be debated in the plenary session of the Congress. The congresspersons of Popular Force, Apra and Alianza para el Progreso joined the request and thus exceeded the 26 signatures needed to proceed with the process. Once the motion was approved, the debate began at 4 and 38 in the afternoon of December 15 and lasted until the night. The opposition legislators who introduced the motion cited a moral inability to denounce that the president lied in the statements he gave on his ties with the Brazilian company. On the other hand, the congressmen demanded that due process be followed, reproaching the fact that the opposition proceeded with unusual speed and that several of its members had already decided to vote the president without having heard his defense. They also questioned the fact that a single report from Odebrecht was considered sufficient evidence, which would openly disregard the investigation that demanded such a delicate and far- reaching case. According to the regulations, the vacancy request was required to be accepted for acceptance. vote of 40% of able congressmen. As 118 congressmen were present, only 48 votes were needed, which was widely exceeded, as they voted 93 in favor and 17 against; the latter were, for the most part, those of the ruling party caucus. Once the vacancy request was approved, Congress agreed that on Thursday, December 21, at 9 o'clock in the morning, Kuczynski should present itself, with or without its lawyer, the plenary session of the Congress to make his discharges, giving him all the necessary time; then it would proceed to debate and finally vote to decide the presidential vacancy, needed for this 87 votes of the total of 130 congressmen. On the day, Kuczynski went to Congress to exercise their defense, accompanied by his lawyer Alberto Borea Odría. The defense began with the speech of the president himself, who reiterated in denying that he had committed any act of corruption. Then came the defense of Borea, described as brilliant, which was at the core of his argument that the request for vacancy was an exaggeration because you could not accuse a president of the Republic without demonstrating evidence of his \\"permanent moral incapacity.\\" It considered that the imputed crimes had to ventilate first in the investigating commission, before drawing hasty conclusions. He also rejected that Kuczynski has repeatedly lied about his relationship with Odebrecht, since the events in question had occurred 12 years ago and he did not have to keep them in mind. Once Borea's address was over, the congressional debate began, which lasted fourteen hours. Voting for the vacancy took place after eleven o'clock at night, with the following result: 78 votes in favor, 19 against and 21 abstentions. One of the benches, the one of New Peru, retired before the voting, adducing that they would not be lent to the game raised by the fujimoristas. Since 87 votes were needed to proceed with the vacancy, it was dismissed. The entire People's Power caucus voted in favor of the vacancy, with the exception of 10 of its members, headed by Kenji Fujimori, who abstained, and who thus decided the result. The rumor spread that this dissident group had negotiated its votes with the government in exchange for the presidential pardon in favor of Alberto Fujimori, its historical leader imprisoned for ten years. = The Fujimorist majority opposition = Keiko Fujimori, former leader of the majority opposition faction Popular Force. The governance crisis was originated by the existence of a majority opposition caucus in Congress, which continuously confronts a weakened Executive Power, which it accuses of ineffectiveness to solve the country's problems. Until September 2017, that is to say, in one year and two months of government, Fujimorism had led to the fall of five ministers. Several analysts considered that what Fujimorism was looking for was to bring down the country's institutions and control the Public Prosecutor's Office. Constitutional Court and the Presidency of the Republic. All this would point to shield its leader Keiko Fujimori, seriously involved in the Odebrecht case. * Against the Public Ministry: Fujimorism, through its congressman Daniel Salaverry, made a constitutional accusation against the prosecutor of the Nation Pablo Sanchez, because supposedly not He had initiated investigations against several Peruvian companies that were members of Odebrecht. To which was added another constitutional complaint against the same prosecutor raised by Yeni Vilcatoma, a former member of the Fujimorist caucus, who questioned her functional responsibility for issuing a resolution which provided that any new complaint for organized crime and money laundering be remitted only to the office of prosecutor Hamilton Castro, responsible for the Odebrecht case. * Against the Constitutional Court (TC): From the Subcommission of Constitutional Accusations of Congress, Fujimorism, allied with the aprismo, approved to recommend to the full of the Congre or the dismissal and disqualification for 10 years of Judge Eloy Espinosa-Saldaña and the suspension for 30 days to three other judges: Manuel Miranda, Marianella Ledesma and Carlos Ramos, all of them accused by eleven retired sailors of having violated the constitutional precept of the \\"immutability of res judicata\\" by issuing a resolution in which they rendered null and void the statement of a sentence of 2013, in which it was said that the El Frontón massacre of 1986 was not a crime against humanity. The members of the TC went to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights to denounce what they considered a threat to the independence of their functions by the Peruvian Congress. That court gave the reason to the magistrates and asked Congress to file the accusation. * Against His Excellency, the President: The revelations that Odebrecht had made payments for consultancies to the Kuczynski sole proprietorship when he was Minister of State, would have been made in search of the presidential vacancy, that although it was not achieved during the vote in the Congress of December 21, 2017, Fujimorism spokesmen warned that they would seek more evidence to commit the president in the Odebrecht case to raise another vacancy motion (as, indeed, they did). Also the leftists of Frente Amplio and Nuevo Peru pointed to the same, although adding another motivation for the vacancy, referred to the humanitarian pardon to Alberto Fujimori, which they considered illegal. = Pardon of Former President Alberto Fujimori = Protests against the pardon of former President Alberto Fujimori, imprisoned for corruption and multiple cases of human rights abuses. On December 24, 2017, the president granted a humanitarian pardon to Alberto Fujimori, who had been imprisoned for 12 years, with a sentence of 25 years for crimes of human rights violations (La Cantuta and Barrios Altos cases). Kuczynski called on young people not to be carried away by hatred and turn the page, to lead the country towards \\"a fraternal Bicentennial of peace and prosperity.\\" The government assured that the pardon had been decided for purely humanitarian reasons, in view of the various physical ills afflicting the former president of the Republic, confirmed by reports of a medical board. However, a strong suspicion arose that the pardon would have been the result of a furtive pact of the Kuczynski government with the sector of the Fujimorist bloc that had abstained during the vote for the presidential vacancy and that in that way had prevented it from concrete this. The pardon also motivated the resignation of the official congressmen Alberto de Belaunde, Vicente Zeballos and Gino Costa; of the Minister of Culture Salvador del Solar and of the Minister of Defense Jorge Nieto Montesinos; as well as the accomplishment of diverse marches in Lima and the interior of the country in protest against the pardon. Since the beginning of the crisis, Minister Carlos Basombrío had also presented his resignation, which was accepted by Kuczynski on December 27, 2017, being replaced by retired Police General Vicente Romero Fernández. The writer Mario Vargas Llosa considered the pardon as a \\"betrayal\\" of Kuczynski to the democratic electorate that had elected him in rejection of autocratic Fujimori. Fujimori, who days before the pardon had been admitted to a clinic for complications in his health, was discharged on January 4, 2018 and thus could, for the first time, move freely. Kuczynski also announced its desire to form a new ministerial cabinet, which he called \\"the Cabinet of Reconciliation\\", which according to him, should mark a new stage in the relationship between the Executive and the Legislative. = The Cabinet of Reconciliation (Aráoz, second phase) = President Kuczynski and his \\"Cabinet of Reconciliation\\", in the official photo after the swearing-in ceremony. On January 9, 2018, the president swore to his cabinet that he called the \\"Cabinet of Reconciliation.\\" Mercedes Aráoz was presided over and eight ministerial changes were made, the most important renewal so far in the government. Cayetana Aljovín, who held the portfolio of Energy and Mines, went on to Foreign Affairs. The new ministers who were sworn in were: Jorge Kisic (Defense), José Arista Arbildo (Agriculture), Lieneke Schol (Production), Jorge Meléndez Celis (Development and Social Inclusion), Ángela Grossheim (Energy and Mines), Abel Salinas Rivas ( Health), Javier Barreda (Work) and Alejandro Neyra (Culture). The ceremony was held in the Great Hall of Government Palace. Two of the new ministers (Barreda and Salinas) were apristas militants, being expelled from their party when knowing that they would integrate the cabinet, to demarcate like this any collaboration with the government. Meléndez is an official congressman, representing Loreto. Kisic is a retired general of the FAP. Neyra is a diplomat, writer and former director of the National Library. The other ministers are linked to the business sector. Kuczynski has also highlighted that it is a cabinet that represents the diversity of Peru and that it will seek reconciliation with dialogue. = Internal faction disputes in Popular Force = On January 30, 2018, the disciplinary committee of Popular Force advised to expel Congressmen Kenji Fujimori, Bienvenido Ramírez and Maritza García from their parliamentary caucus, the same ones who, along with six other congressmen, had abstained from voting in favor of the Presidential vacancy. The next day Kenji Fujimori and the 9 parliamentarians in question agreed to present their irrevocable resignation to their caucus, thus giving themselves the most important schism within Fujimorism since their appearance on the political scene. Kenji Fujimori justified this decision by citing the repeated abuses that he had been receiving from the People's Power leadership only because he had opted for the country's governability and reconciliation; when asked if he would form a new caucus, he said he would wait for the Court's ruling on the unconstitutionality suit filed against the law that prohibits the formation of new parliamentary groups in Congress. On March 1, 2018, Kenji Fujimori announced his departure from Popular Force, following the revelation that the Odebrecht company had contributed one million two hundred thousand dollars to the party for the 2011 electoral campaign. = Second process to impeach the president = In January 2018, the Frente Amplio caucus put forward a new request for a presidential vacancy, with the cause of the pardon to Alberto Fujimori, which allegedly had been negotiated and granted illegally. This did not prosper, given the lack of support from Popular Force, whose votes were necessary to carry out such an initiative. Under that experience, the leftist groups of Frente Amplio and Nuevo Peru promoted another vacancy motion, concentrating exclusively on the Odebrecht case, arguing that new indications of corruption and conflict of interest had been discovered by Kuczynski when he was Minister of State in the Government of Toledo. This time they won the support of Popular Force, as well as other groups like the Alliance for Progress, thus gathering the 27 minimum votes needed to present a multiparty motion before the Congress of the Republic, which was held on March 8, 2018. On March 15, the admission of this motion was debated in the plenary session of the Congress, with the result being 87 votes in favor, 15 votes against and 15 abstentions. The motion received the backing of all the parties, except for Peruvians for the Kambio and non-grouped congressmen, among them, the three ex-oficialistas and the Kenji Fujimori bloc. The Board of Spokespersons scheduled the debate on the presidential vacancy request for Thursday, March 22. A confidential report from the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) sent to the Public Ministry and the Lava Jato Commission of Congress was leaked to public knowledge. This 33-page document revealed that from the companies and consortiums linked to the Odebrecht Group, transfers had been made to Westfield Capital, the sole proprietorship of Kuczynski, for $1,893,841, that is, one million more than what was known up to the moment. The leak of this report, which is presumed to have been made by the Lava Jato Commission chaired by Rosa Bartra, would have been intended to further dent the credibility of the President of the Republic, although it added little to what was already known. But the deadly blow to Kuczynski came a few days later. = \\"Kenjivideos\\" scandal = On March 20, 2018, the Popular Force bench showed evidence that the government was buying the support of congressmen to vote against the presidential vacancy, a rumor that had already circulated during the first process. It was a set of videos showing the conversations that legislators Bienvenido Ramírez and Guillermo Bocángel (from the bench of Kenji Fujimori) had made to try to convince congressman Moisés Mamani (from Puno) not to join in supporting the presidential vacancy. In one of the videos, Kenji Fujimori is seen in a meeting with Mamani, which also includes Bienvenido Ramírez. The latter makes a series of offers to the parliamentarian from Pune to enable him to streamline projects and projects for his region, in exchange for joining his group and supporting Kuczynski. In another video you see Bocángel talking about the administrative control of the Congress, once they access the Board. And in a third video, you see Alberto Borea Odría, Kuczynski's lawyer on the subject of vacancy, explaining to Mamani about aspects of that process and giving him the telephone number of a minister of state. A few hours later, the Fujimoristas gave the final thrust, by broadcasting a set of audios, in which the Minister of Transport and Communications, Bruno Giuffra is heard offering works to Mamani in exchange for his vote to avoid the vacancy. The press highlighted a phrase from Giuffra in which he says: \\"Compadre, you know what the nut is and what you are going to get out\\", presumably referring to the benefits Mamani would get if he voted against the vacancy. = Resignation of President Kuczynski = Main article: Resignation of Pedro Pablo Kuczynski The revelation of those videos and audios caused much commotion in the political environment. Until then, it was expected that the vote to achieve the vacancy would be very tight and that even Kuczynski could again succeed as had happened in the first process. But the kenjivideos determined that several congressmen who until then had manifested their abstention (among them the three ex- oficialistas) they folded in favor of the vacancy, and thus they made it known openly. Faced with the foreseeable scenario that awaited him in the debate scheduled for the Congress on the 22nd, Kuczynski opted to renounce the Presidency of the Republic, sending the respective letter to Congress, and giving a message to the Nation transmitted at two forty in the morning. afternoon of March 21, 2018. > \\"I believe that the best thing for the country is for me to resign from the > Presidency of the Republic. I wish not to be an obstacle for our nation's > efforts to find the path of unity and harmony that is so critically needed > and has been denied to me. I do not want the country or my family to > continue suffering with the uncertainty of recent times (...) There will be > a constitutionally ordered transition.\\" > \\\\- Kuczynski, in his message of resignation to the Presidency of the > Republic. Lima, March 21, 2018. The Board of Spokespersons of the Congress, although rejected the terms of the letter of resignation of Kuczynski, which considered nothing self-critical, accepted the same and scheduled for March 22, from four in the afternoon, a debate in Congress to evaluate the resignation, the same one that continued the next day. Although a section of congressmen on the left argued that Kuczynski's resignation should not be accepted and that Congress should proceed to vacancy due to moral incapacity, the majority of congressmen considered that they should accept to close the page at once. When the preliminary text of the resolution of the Congress in which Kuczynski was pointed out to him as a \\"traitor to the fatherland\\" became public, he announced that he would withdraw his letter of resignation if that qualification was maintained. The Board of Spokesmen decided then to omit that expression. The resignation was accepted with 105 votes in favor, 12 against and 3 abstentions. Moments later, Martín Vizcarra, newly arrived from Canada, was sworn in as the new constitutional president of the Republic.  The Odebrecht case  On December 21, 2016, a document was published by the US Department of Justice that revealed that Brazilian construction company Odebrecht had paid bribes to public officials in 12 countries (including Peru) to win public works tenders. It would be the biggest corruption scandal in Latin America. In the case of Peru, according to judicial investigators, Odebrecht would have paid approximately 29 million dollars in bribes to officials, which generated more than 143 million dollars in benefits, although it is likely that the amount of bribes and bribes been much older. This would have occurred between 2005 and 2014, corresponding to the governments of Alejandro Toledo (2001–2006), Alan García (2006–2011) and Ollanta Humala (2011–2016). Since November 2016, the Prosecutor's Office in Peru had been investigating the case known from Brazil as Operation Lava Jato. Upon hearing the news, President Kuczynski said he would support everything necessary for the investigation. He denied being involved in the corruption scandal when he was prime minister of the Toledo government. = Statements by Jorge Barata and Marcelo Odebrecht = Marcelo Odebrecht (former president of the construction company) and Jorge Barata (executive director of the company in Peru), welcomed the award-winning or effective collaboration to reduce their sentences and are collaborating with the justice of Brazil and Peru. The declarations of these characters have compromised Peruvian presidents and officials, about the receipt of bribes to favor the Brazilian company in the bidding for public works, as well as \\"ghost\\" contributions to finance the electoral campaigns of various candidates (the latter would come to configure the criminal figure of money laundering). Marcelo Odebrecht answered the questions of the Peruvian prosecutors in May and November 2017, about the contribution of three million dollars that he made for the election campaign of Ollanta Humala in 2011, as well as about his annotations in his agenda, where he mentioned some politicians like Keiko Fujimori. Barata, in his first declarations, revealed the delivery of 20 million dollars as a bribe to President Alejandro Toledo for the South Interoceanic Highway. Then, before a team of Peruvian prosecutors, on February 27 and 28, 2018, he answered several questions, revealing the contributions made by the Odebrecht company to the presidential candidacies of 2011 (Humala, Keiko, Kuczynski), detailing the amounts and intermediaries. = Main stakeholders = The most resounding case is that of former President Alejandro Toledo, who would have received 20 million dollars, delivered by Barata, in exchange for the concession of sections II and III of the South Interoceanic Highway. The capture of Toledo was ordered, who is currently fugitive in the United States. He was opened an extradition booklet, sustained by influence peddling, collusion and money laundering to the detriment of the State. On March 15, 2018, the Supreme Court declared the request for extradition admissible, which was approved by the Executive Power, through the Council of Ministers. Another accusation was the payment of bribes in the tender for Line 1 of the Lima Metro, which occurred under García's second government, when Enrique Cornejo was Minister of Transport and Communications. They were accused Jorge Cuba, former deputy communications minister; Miguel Navarro, former official of the Vice Ministry of Communications; and Mariella Huerta, former director of the bidding committee of the Lima Metro; Edwin Luyo, member of the same committee. Cuba, Navarro and Luyo were captured and imprisoned, while Huerta is fugitive. The former volleyball player Jéssica Tejada, a couple from Cuba, was also arrested for having lent her name to one of the offshore accounts where the bribe money was deposited. The revelations of other former Odebrecht officials also involved two regional governors: Félix Moreno Caballero (Callao) and Jorge Acurio Tito (Cuzco). Moreno has been related to receiving a bribe of 4.2 million dollars for the concession to the Brazilian company of a section of the Costa Verde, for which he was given preventive detention. Acurio is accused of having agreed to a 3 million dollar bribe to favor the Brazilian company with the work Via de Evitamiento in Cuzco. The Office of the Prosecutor issued 18 months of preventive detention. In relation to this case, the lawyer José Zaragozá, syndicated as an intermediary in the payments, has also been arrested, who accepted the award. Both Acurio and Moreno appealed the mandate of preventive detention. The Appeals Chamber confirmed the preventive detention of Acurio, but revoked the one of Moreno, who happened to face the process in restricted appearance (June 7, 2017). Among those involved in the scandal is the former president Ollanta Humala and his wife Nadine Heredia, because Barata said he had given the latter three million dollars, at the request of the Brazilian Workers Party, political affinity to the Nationalist Party of Humala. That amount would have been destined for the electoral campaign of 2011, in which Humala was elected president. On July 13, 2017, the First Preparatory Investigation Court, headed by Judge Richard Concepción Carhuancho, approved the request for 18 months of preventive detention against Humala and his wife, presented by the money laundering office, which alleged risk of escape or asylum claim. The next day, Humala was interned in the Diroes prison (Ate), and Nadine Heredia went to the Virgen de Fátima prison, attached to the women's prison of Chorrillos. In investigations is the ex-president Alan García, whose initials of his name appear on the agenda of Marcelo Odebrecht, as revealed by a journalistic publication. In its statements to Peruvian prosecutors in November 2017, Odebrecht confirmed that these acronyms of AG correspond to Alan García, although without linking it to any bribe payment. In November 2017, the former mayor of Lima Susana Villarán, who was already in the process of investigation, was directly related to the case by the Brazilian consultant Valdemir Garreta, an aspiring collaborator, who told the Peruvian prosecutor's office that the Odebrecht companies and OAS financed the campaign for the No to the revocation in 2013 for an amount of three million dollars, and that in that transaction served as an intermediary municipal official José Miguel Castro, right arm of the then mayor of Lima. All that revelation has been confirmed by Jorge Barata himself. Although, in the opinion of some, Villarán would be given preventive detention, he was only prevented from leaving the country for eight months. = The Kuczynski investigation = President Kuczynski was also included in the investigation of the Lava Jato case, for having been prime minister under the Toledo government (when the interoceanic highway was awarded to the Odebrecht company) and for the alleged financing he received from the government. The same company in its campaign for the 2011 and 2016 presidencies. In this regard, Kuczynski sent in October 2017 an official letter to the Lava Jato commission of the Congress in which it explained the matters on which it could be consulted, and that it would respond in writing. Kuczynski's refusal to receive the Commission in person (up to six times), was due to the fact that, according to his version, when in February 2017 he received the Supervisory Commission (chaired by Héctor Becerril), he had received a series of abuse. However, the Fujimorista bloc demanded that the explanations be given in person and even pushed for a bill so that a president of the Republic is obliged to appear before congressional commissions, which, according to constitutional experts, has no support in the Constitution. In November 2017, it transpired that Marcelo Odebrecht would have revealed some advice that Kuczynski provided to his company. Although Kuczynski flatly denied having had a working relationship with the Odebrecht company, Congress was once again required to receive the Lava Jato Commission in person. In December 2017, the president of the Lava Jato Commission, Rosa Bartra, insisted that Kuczynski respond in person before the commission, giving it as a sort of ultimatum. Given the repeated response of Kuczynski that only respond in writing, Bartra made the disclosure of payments that the Odebrecht company had made between 2005 and 2006 to the consulting companies Westfield Capital and First Capital, linked to President Kuczynski, then Minister of State. It should be noted, however, that none of these payments were bribes, but that they were all legal; What was questioned was the fact that Kuczynski received them through his sole proprietorship (Westfield Capital) as a Minister of State, something constitutionally forbidden. Pushed by the revelations, Kuczynski agreed to have received a consulting payment for the H2 Olmos project, from the same Brazilian company. This only increased political tension due to its supposed contradictions. Crisis came about because of the presidential vacancy that Kuczynski was able to overcome, at first, in December 2017. Then, when a second vacancy request was submitted, in March 2018, he had to resign from the presidency shortly before the vote in Congress, due to the scandal of the kenjivideo (see more details in the Political section). Days before his resignation from the presidency, Kuczynski finally received the Lava Jato Commission on March 16, 2018, where he responded to a seven-hour interrogation. In addition to the matter of contractual relations between his consulting firms and the companies of the Odebrecht group, he was questioned about the financing of his 2011 election campaign, when he applied for the group Alianza por el Gran Cambio. No sooner did Kuczynski resign as president, when he was prevented from leaving the country and the raid of his two homes was ordered (one in San Isidro, and the other in Cieneguilla). = The Keiko Fujimori case and Popular Force = Already before the outbreak of the Odebrecht scandal, Keiko Fujimori and his Popular Force party were in the investigation because of the financing of their electoral campaign. A judicial process was opened to Keiko Fujimori, for alleged money laundering. The matter was further complicated for the former presidential candidate when it was revealed that in the agenda of Marcelo Odebrecht's cell phone, there was a very compromising phrase: \\"Increase Keiko for 500 e eu fazer visita\\". It was said that the figure referred to five hundred thousand dollars and that it was a contribution for his electoral campaign of 2011. In November 2017, a team of Peruvian prosecutors questioned Marcelo Odebrecht in the city of Curitiba, about the case of Keiko Fujimori. The businessman confirmed that he had contributed to Keiko's presidential campaigns, although he explained that it was Barata who knew the exact amounts. In February 2018, Barata revealed that she had contributed one million two hundred thousand dollars in favor of Keiko's electoral campaign in 2011, and that the intermediaries of that delivery had been Jaime Yoshiyama, Augusto Bedoya and Ricardo Briceño, the latter's representative of the CONFIEP.

This is an atypical phenomenon, which occurs almost unannounced. Unlike the typical El Niño phenomenon, which impacts the entire Pacific basin, affecting even climate on a planetary scale (and whose last devastating exponents have been those of 1983 and 1997–98), El Niño is focalized, since it only affects the coast of Peru and Ecuador. A similar event occurred in 1925, which was the prelude to the Niño of 1926, which is considered the third mega -child in importance of the twentieth century, only below those of 1983 and 1997–98. Characteristic of this phenomenon are the intense rains. These are caused by the warming of the sea off the north coast of Peru, up to 29 °C, when the normal is 22º or a little more; this causes the water to evaporate, forming clouds that then precipitate as rain on the coast. The rains cause both landslides or mudslides, and river overflows or floods, severely affecting the populations settled in its path. = Areas affected = The most serious damages were verified in the departments of northern Peru: Tumbes, Piura and Lambayeque, which have endured intense rains, sometimes accompanied by thunderstorms, causing floods, damage to homes and destruction of crops. Several kilometers of roads were also damaged and a lot of unused bridges. Other affected departments have been La Libertad and Áncash. In Trujillo, several streets were flooded by water and mud; the mother channel of Chavimochic, from where the drinking water that is distributed to the city comes, suffered a rupture, reason why this service was suspended. Huarmey was completely flooded by the overflow of the river of the same name. In the province of Lima, the overflows of the rivers Chillón, Rímac, Huaycoloro and Lurín, affected several riverside localities, the most affected being: Cajamarquilla, Carapongo, Huachipa and Chosica.Juan Guillermo Lara / Óscar Paz / Cristina Fernández (18 de marzo de 2017). «Aislados por los desbordes». El Comercio (edición impresa) (Lima). The potable water supply of the Peruvian capital was also affected, since the waters of the rivers were loaded with garbage and mud, the task of capturing the water resource became more complicated, so the Drinking Water and Sewage Service of Lima (Sedapal), restricted the service for several days.Prensa Latina (15 de marzo de 2017). «Capital peruana se queda sin agua por estragos de lluvias». www.pressreader.com. Consultado el 26 de marzo de 2017. Other provinces of Lima also suffered havoc: Huarochirí, where the most affected town were Santa Eulalia, and Cañete, whose capital, San Vicente de Cañete, suffered flood of the Río Pócoto. Further south, the departments of Ica and Arequipa also suffered the ravages of the rains and the overflows of the rivers. In January, the activation of the streams caused the flooding of the town of La Tinguiña (Ica) . The city of Arequipa suffered restrictions in the potable water service, due to the high turbidity recorded in the Chili River, which made treatment system.Claudia Beltrán (14 de marzo de 2017). \\"Inesperada lluvia provocó huaicos y corte del servicio del agua en Arequipa\\". La República (Lima). = Government assistance = To respond to the emergency situation, the National Emergency Operations Center (COEN) was installed, headed by Defense Minister Jorge Nieto Montesinos (February 6, 2017). President Kuczynski announced on March 17 that a priority of 2,500 million soles would be allocated to deal with disasters; also that facilities would be granted to municipalities and regional governments to execute and expedite the works for the improvement of disaster areas; as well as flexibility to a series of ministries so that they can reallocate the budget items, being the sectors that would have the largest budget those of Defense, Sanitation and Housing, Agriculture, Transport, Production, Health and Interior.Mario Mejía (18 de marzo de 2017). \\"Recursos para la reconstrucción\\". El Comercio (edición impresa) (Lima). Nine ministers were also designated to organize aid to the different affected regions: Alfonso Grados (Tumbes); Marilú Martens (Piura); Eduardo Ferreyros (Lambayeque); Cayetana Aljovín (La Libertad); Marisol Pérez Tello (Áncash); Ana María Romero-Lozada (districts of Rímac, Cercado and San Juan de Lurigancho); Salvador del Solar (Huachipa and Carapongo); Gonzalo Tamayo (Chosica and Santa Eulalia); and Elsa Galarza (south boy to Mala). As a sign of solidarity towards the victims, the government created the slogan \\"One force\\", which began to be used by institutions and people to call for help from citizens. The portal unasolafuerza.pe (#UnaSolaFuerza) was launched to provide up-to-date information on the emergence of the hurricanes and rains that affected the country. = Reconstruction with changes = In mid-April 2017 the ravages of the coastal Niño began to diminish. By then, the number of those killed in the entire territory of Peru was 113, the victims 178 701 and the people affected 1,049,083. The affected homes totaled 237,906.Maricarmen Chinchay (18 de abril de 2017). \\"'El Niño costero': se eleva a 113 el número de víctimas a nivel nacional\\". La República (Lima). According to Minister Gonzalo Tamayo, the impact of the phenomenon was worse that of an earthquake, since 1,500 kilometers of simultaneous emergency were activated.\\"MEM: Fenómeno del Niño ha sido peor que un terremoto». La República (Lima). 16 de abril de 2017. On May 5, 2017 it was announced that the authority in charge of the reconstruction would be Pablo de la Flor. The title of his position is: Executive Director of the Authority for Reconstruction with Changes. According to the Ministry of Economy and Finance, about 20 billion soles (about 6 billion dollars) is expected to be spent on reconstruction. When questioned by the regional governors about the delays in the Reconstruction projects, Pablo de la Flor resigned his post at the end of October 2017. He was replaced by the economist Édgar Quispe.  Social Issues  = Social protests =  Protest against the national school curriculum  At the beginning of 2017, the implementation of the National School Curriculum 2017, triggered the formation of a self-proclaimed collective with my children do not get involved (CMHNTM) to change it based on the argument that it promotes homosexuality. In response, the Minister of Education Marilú Martens said that in the new contents the Curriculum seeks respect for diversity in society, promoting gender equality, in the sense of equal opportunities, rights and responsibilities for men and women without distinction. Other advocates of the Curriculum noted the fact that the CMHNTM's criticisms stem from a confusion of concepts, about biological sex (male and female), gender identity and sexual orientation. These responses and other similar ones given by government spokesmen were considered arrogant by the leaders of the CMHNTM collective, since, according to them, they take advantage of values as precious as equality and respect for men and women, to smuggle and overlapping the \\"gender ideology\\" in the Curriculum. As a protest, the CMHNTM organized a march on March 4, 2017, which was held nationwide, bringing together a total of 68,340 people throughout the country, of whom 25,000 were in Lima. Soon after, Minister Martens announced the realization of some changes in the School Curriculum, to specify concepts that could be confusing to parents, but making it clear that the gender equality approach remained unchanged.  Magisterial strike  One of the promises of Kuczynski's election campaign was the increase of teachers' salaries at all levels. In March 2017, by Supreme Decree No. 070-2017-EF, the increase for the appointed teachers was made official, passing the minimum wage from 1,554 soles to 1,780 soles, with the added promise that by March 2018 it would rise to 2000 With regard to those hired, it was decided that the increases would begin in November 2017. However, protest voices rose in the teachers' union, which argued that Kuczynski's promise had been that the increase of 2,000 soles would be from 2017 and not from 2018, and that by 2021 it should reach 1 UIT, that is, 4,050 soles. Other requirements of the union were the payment of the social debt, the repeal of the Law of Public Magisterial Career, the leveling of the teachers hired with the appointed ones and that 10% of the GDP was dedicated to the Education sector. On June 15, 2017, the teacher strike in Cuzco broke out, encouraged by the Sute-R, that is, the regional section of the SUTEP. Education Minister Marilú Martens responded that what the teachers demanded was not feasible, if the budget was realistically considered. The dialogue tables between the technical team of the Ministry of Education and the representatives of the teachers' union, sponsored by the Regional Government, failed successively, accusing each other of intransigence. The government attributed the strike to the political motivations of the unions, where there were infiltrations by extremist elements, including Movadef, the political facade of the Shining Path. The teachers' strike extended to 13 regions, five of which were radicalized: Puno, Madre de Dios, Moquegua, Apurímac, as well as Cusco, which was the nerve center. In response, the Minister notified the Comptroller's Office to take the necessary measures to safeguard the educational service, and demanded that the Regional Governments proceed to dismiss the teachers and hire others, if necessary. In search of a solution to the strike that had been going on for more than a month and a half, Minister Martens, Prime Minister Zavala, the 25 regional governors and the Regional Office of Lima met. They reached an agreement that was announced on August 3, which consisted in the increase of S/.2000 will be held from December 2017 and no longer from March 2018. With this, the matter was considered solved and it was announced that the classes would restart on August 7. However, the teachers indicated that they were not represented in the agreements with the government, so they continued with the strike. On August 8, the government signed another agreement, this time with the group of regional secretaries of SUTEP (Sute-R), agreeing to lift the strike in Cuzco, Lambayeque, Pasco and Lima Provincias. But in several regions the measure of strength was maintained (18 in total), because the Bases of the teachers' union did not consider themselves duly represented by the National Executive Committee (CEN) of the SUTEP, nor by the Sute-R. It was these Bases, gathered in the National Committee of Struggle of the Bases of the SUTEP and under the leadership of Pedro Castillo Terrones, which in reality ended up managing the mobilizations of the teachers in all the regions. The same Kuczynski president offered himself as mediator, inviting the delegates of the teachers to meet him in the Palace to reach a solution, but the strike got even worse, with the arrival in the capital of the striking teachers of the regions, those who carried out marches in the city and concentrations in the Plaza San Martín. On August 16, Martens presented himself to the education commission of the Congress, where he promised to receive the representatives of the regional bases. They accepted the invitation. On the evening of the same day, President Kuczynski, in a television message to the Nation, exhorted the teachers to strike down and return to the schools. While, on August 18, dialogue began between the specialists of the Ministry of Education and the leaders of the teachers, who were joined by five congressmen representing the various parties (except for the Popular Force), who were in the capacity of overseers, but ended up becoming intermediaries. After four days of meetings, a preliminary agreement was foreseen in which it appeared that the increase of S / 2000 would begin in November 2017, that would be leveled to teachers hired with those named in both salaries and social benefits, would be scheduled the payment of the social debt, would allow the voluntary retirement of teachers from 55 years of age, among other benefits for the teaching sector. However, when the signing of the agreement was only expected, the teachers announced that they would not do so, questioning the fact that the minister had not received them personally and had used the congressmen as intermediaries. But according to the report of the congressmen, it was because the teachers insisted that the evaluation of the teachers be suspended indefinitely and that was the point at which the Ministry of Education did not want to give the arm to twist, considering that the meritocracy in the teaching career it was something non-negotiable. It was then clarified that the teachers do not really oppose the evaluations, but rather the procedure that they intend to apply, which they described as having a subjective character. Interior Minister Carlos Basombrío Iglesias was also pointed out as having been a disturbing element in the negotiations, for organizing the leader of the bases, Pedro Castillo, as close to the Movadef senderista, and for saying that the government would not negotiate with that class of elements. . Although a large section of the faculty held the strike, on August 24 the government issued a supreme decree formalizing the benefits mentioned in the pre-agreement, and the teachers were warned that if they did not return to the classroom after August 28, new teachers would be hired. In the following week, the teacher marches in the capital followed, which included violent confrontations with the police. Until September 2, the leader Pedro Castillo announced the temporary suspension of the strike, according to an agreement reached at the Extraordinary National Congress of the regional SUTEs.  Strikes in the health sector  On July 4, 2017, doctors from the Ministry of Health began an indefinite national strike to demand a series of improvements in their sector. The measure paralyzed care in various services, with the exception of the intensive care and emergency units. Among the claims of the Peruvian Medical Federation is the increase in the budget for the Health sector and for the Comprehensive Health Insurance (SIS). They also demanded the resignation of the Minister of Health Patricia Garcia Funegra, who is responsible for the very poor situation of the sector, for not having requested a larger budget for the year 2017, which has generated the shortage of medicines, reagents and equipment. On August 9, after a meeting of the representatives of the FMP with Prime Minister Fernando Zavala and Minister Patricia García, the strike was lifted, after agreeing an increase in the budget for the health sector that implies salary increases and greater supply of medicines and implements in health centers, among other agreements. Likewise, the Federation of Nurses of the Ministry of Health of Peru (Fedeminsap), which brings together nurses working in establishments belonging to the Ministry of Health network (MINSA), began on August 8, 2017 an indefinite strike in all the regions, in demand for an increase in the budget of the Health and SIS sector, the approval of a new salary scale, the implementation of nursing head positions, and the increase in the number of nurses hired. Finally, on August 19, after several sessions of dialogue between the Ministry of Health and the Federation, an agreement was reached, and the strike was lifted at a national level. A national obstetric strike was also unleashed, which lasted 13 days, from August 3 to 16, 2017.  Agricultural stop of 2018  On January 9, 2018, an \\"agrarian strike\\" was initiated in large part of the Peruvian territory by medium and small independent farmers who demanded that the government declare the agricultural sector in a state of emergency, due to serious deficiencies in production and trade, especially in the potato sector, whose price had collapsed severely affecting producers. According to experts, this was due to the fact that, as a consequence of the El Niño phenomenon, the plantings and harvests of potatoes had coincided in the various regions, causing overproduction. On January 30, 2018, the demonstrations turned violent and expanded to other departments, causing road blocks and serious material damage. Clashes took place between the national police of Peru and the demonstrators who left two people dead, one in Huancavelica and the other in Pasco. On February 2, the government reached an agreement with the National Commission of Potato Producers, promising to buy the surplus of white potatoes. Although other leaderships in Huánuco, Ayacucho and Apurímac did not accept that agreement and the protests continued. = National Census of 2017 = On October 22, 2017 the XII Population Census, VII Housing and III Indigenous Communities began, which culminated on November 5. The entity in charge of its realization was the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics (INEI). The census questionnaire had 47 questions regarding housing and basic services; to home; the migration of the home and the formation of families; on gender, disability and ethnicity. For the urban census the immobility of citizenship was declared on October 22, but serious deficiencies occurred in its development, mainly due to the lack of training of census takers, mostly young volunteers. The cost of this census was calculated in S/170 million (US$52 million).  International relations  = APEC 2016 = From November 19 to 20, 2016, the capital of Peru hosted the 28th annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum (APEC), and the 24th of its leaders. For the second time, Lima assumed this responsibility, since it had already done so in 2008. It is a summit of the presidents and governors of the twenty-one member countries of the economic forum, including Barack Obama (United States), Vladimir Putin ( Russia) and Xi Jinping (China); and three presidents of Latin American countries: Michelle Bachelet (Chile), Enrique Peña Nieto (Mexico), as well as the president of the host country, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski. As guests attended the president of Colombia Juan Manuel Santos; Mark Zuckerberg (founder of Facebook); and Christine Lagarde (managing director of the IMF); among others. The agreements taken by the members of APEC, contained in the Declaration of Lima, revolved around 4 pillars: foreign trade; workers and small business; the connectivity; and climate change and food security. The most important initiatives were oriented to counteract the tendencies against foreign trade that emerged in some important countries, such as the case of the electoral threat of Donald Trump in the United States. = Official visits of Kuczynski abroad = The first official visit of Kuczynski abroad went to China, in September 2016, where he met with President Xi Jinping, as well as with authorities of the political, business and commercial sector of that country. Kuczynski called this visit a success. Then he went to New York, where he participated in the 71 Period of Sessions of the General Assembly of the United Nations. In November 2016 Kuczynski traveled to Chile, where he met with the president of that country, Michelle Bachelet. The bilateral agreements that were taken were the improvement of the infrastructure, the railroad from Tacna to Arica and the electrical interconnection for both cities. The start of the Binational Cabinets was also agreed. On February 24, 2017, Kuczynski became the first Latin American president to visit United States President Donald Trump in the White House. The meeting lasted about 40 minutes. In a subsequent dialogue with journalists, Kuczynski said he had spoken about \\"issues of common interest, such as trade, migration, problems in Latin America and the possibility of a very good relationship with the United States.\\" It also transpired that the situation in Venezuela was discussed. From June 6 to 14, 2017, Kuczynski made an official visit to France and Spain, together with the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Ricardo Luna; and of Economy and Finance, Alfredo Thorne. In France he held a meeting with President Emmanuel Macron, at the Elysee Palace, becoming the first Latin American president to be received by the French president, who had recently assumed office. In Spain he met with the head of the Government of that country, Mariano Rajoy. On September 15, 2017, due to the ministerial cabinet crisis, Kuczynski suspended a scheduled trip to New York, where he was to attend the General Assembly of the United Nations. On September 22, he traveled to Vatican City to meet with Pope Francisco and thank him for the official visit he would make to Peru in January 2018. On November 3, 2017, Kuczynski made a trip to Argentina, to meet with President Mauricio Macri and sign several bilateral agreements. And on November 9, he arrived in the city of Da Nang, in Vietnam, to attend the 25th Leaders Summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum (APEC). The trip included the signing of a free trade agreement between Peru and Australia. On March 10, 2018, Kuczynski traveled to Chile to attend the inauguration of President Sebastián Piñera. He also met with presidents of other countries and the outgoing president of Chile, Michelle Bachelet. = Bi-national cabinets = In October 2016, the X Peru- Ecuador Binational Cabinet was held in Macas, a meeting of the Ministers of States and the presidents of both nations, where important agreements were agreed. In November 2016, the Second Binational Cabinet Peru-Bolivia was held in Sucre, where presidents Kuczynski and Evo Morales met to sign the Sucre Declaration, in which they highlighted the importance of ministerial cabinets to contribute to the strengthening and deepening the relations of both countries. In July 2017 the First Binational Cabinet Peru-Chile was held in Lima, which has been considered a historic event, as it inaugurated a different stage in the bilateral relations of the two countries. Several agreements were signed between the ministries and institutions of the two nations, and as a culmination, Presidents Kuczynski and Michelle Bachelet signed the Declaration of Lima. In September 2017, the III Peru-Bolivia Binational Cabinet was held in the city of Lima, culminating in the Declaration of Lima signed by the presidents Kuczynski and Evo Morales. In October 2017, the XI Peru-Ecuador Binational Cabinet was held in the city of Trujillo, attended by Ecuadorian President Lenín Moreno, who signed the Declaration of Trujillo with Kuczynski. At the end of February 2018, the IV Binational Cabinet Peru-Colombia was held in Cartagena de Indias, which was attended by President Kuczynski, who met with his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos. = Relations with Venezuela = Peru was one of the countries with the most Venezuelan refugees. In the photo, a Peruvian citizen with a Venezuelan refugee who fled her country because of the current crisis. The Peruvian government assumed a very active role with respect to the Venezuelan crisis. In March 2017 some diplomatic friction with Venezuela took place, as a result of some comments that Kuczynski made about the situation of that country, during his visit to the United States. Before the verbal attacks of the Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro and his chancellor Delcy Rodríguez against Kuczynski, the Peruvian government called in consultation with his ambassador in Caracas, Mario López Chávarry. In the message to the Nation of July 28, 2017, Kuczynski mentioned the situation in Venezuela, referring to the \\"decomposition of democratic institutions\\" and the \\"humanitarian crisis\\" that the country is experiencing, to conclude by saying that its objective was \\"to contribute to strengthen democracy throughout the region\\". On July 30, 2017, the Peruvian government announced that it would not recognize the results of the \\"illegitimate election of the National Constituent Assembly\\" in Venezuela, and then summoned a meeting of foreign ministers from Latin American countries to evaluate the situation in that country. It was held on August 8, 2017, at the Torre Tagle Palace in Lima, and counted with the participation of 17 countries. A 16-point manifesto was signed, called the Lima Declaration, which condemns the breakdown of the democratic order in Venezuela and ignores the National Constituent Assembly. The Venezuelan government sent a protest note to Peru, but it was declared by the Foreign Ministry of Peru as not received, because it contained \\"unacceptable terms.\\" Then, the Government of Peru decided to expel the ambassador of Venezuela, Diego Molero Bellavia. In response, the Venezuelan government ordered the expulsion of the Chargé d'Affaires of Peru (since Peru had already withdrawn its ambassador since March). On February 16, 2018, the Peruvian Foreign Ministry informed that it was withdrawing the invitation to Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to the VIII Summit of the Americas, scheduled to take place in Lima on April 13 and 14. It was based on the provisions of the Declaration of Quebec of 2001, which literally says: \\"Any alteration or unconstitutional rupture of a democratic order in a State of the Hemisphere constitutes an insurmountable obstacle for the participation of the Government of that State in the Summit process. of the Americas.\\" = Visit of Pope Francis = Between January 18 and 21, 2018, Pope Francis made a pastoral visit to Peru, which included the cities of Lima, Puerto Maldonado and Trujillo. He chose Puerto Maldonado (Madre de Dios), in the Peruvian jungle, as the center of a region affected by deforestation and human trafficking; and Trujillo for being the city most affected by the onslaught of El Niño. In all those places he received the fervor and affection of the people. In Puerto Maldonado he had a meeting with the representatives of the Amazonian peoples and in his speeches he addressed issues such as illegal mining, human trafficking and violence against women. In Trujillo he held a mass in the Huanchaco resort and toured the streets in the neighborhood of Buenos Aires affected by the El Niño. As a final act, the Pope offered a Mass at the Las Palmas Air Base (Lima), which according to the calculations of the Archdiocese of Lima brought together one and a half million people.  Post-presidency = Transition to the Vizcarra Administration = Vice President, former Minister of Transport, and then Ambassador to Canada Martin Vizcarra succeeded Kuczynski and assumed the presidency, marking the end of Kuczynski presidency. Then second-vice president and Prime Minister Mercedes Araoz assumed the role of first vice president, leaving the seat for second-vice president vacant. Shortly after on April 2, Araoz resigned from the Prime Ministership, who believed that Vizcarra would completely replace Kuczynski's cabinet. Vizcarra did in fact replace most of Kuczynski's cabinet, and the Vizcarra's new cabinet was inaugurated on April 2, 2018. = Investigations, Operation Car Wash, and Odebrecht = After Kuczynski successfully resigned from the impending congressional impeachment vote, Kuczynski's passport was immediately confiscated and the former head of state was restricted from leaving Peru. His multiple bank accounts were also frozen and were under investigation. The former president remained out of the public eye for nearly a year, with rare public appearances and no interviews until a year after his resignation, unlike most of his predecessors. He gave an interview to El Comercio on the first anniversary of his resignation in March 2019, where he claimed that the suspicious payments he made immediately following his resignation were in fact his tax payments in 2018. Soon, on April 10 of that year, a judge ordered for Kuczynski's arrest and authorized a detail search of his several properties and was ordered preventative detention for 10 days. He was later convicted and sentenced to 36 months of preventative prison. He appealed for house arrest due to his minor health issues and was granted house arrest until further investigations conclude. = Relations with Vizcarra = Kuczynski has mentioned that he has spoken multiple times with Vizcarra and has denied to comment whether he still believes that Vizcarra \\"betrayed\\" him. During his hospitalization, Vizcarra has reportedly visited him once \\"as a friend\\" rather than a political move. Additionally, Vizcarra defended Kuczynski from being transferred from house arrest to prison. = Public persona = Peruvians see Pedro Pablo Kuczynski joining the line of disgraced and corrupt presidents that Peru has had for the past decades. Kuczynski's accomplishments during his brief, less than two-year presidency are seen as minimal and mediocre, having failed to address pressing issues of economic slumps, natural disasters, corruption, and more. Additionally, many Peruvians do note Kuczynski's broken campaign promise to not pardon former president Alberto Fujimori. Kuczynski's presidency is also marked as a time of economic stability and a cheerleader of Peru to the rest of the world. = Health issues = Kuczynski claims to have heart issues.

Opening  The company was incorporated July 17, 1895 and the line was completed February 1, 1896. The primary cargo was ore and ore concentrate from the Iron Mountain Mine, though it increasingly serviced other mines as well. The railroad was owned by Mountain Copper Company which also owned the Iron Mountain Mine and the Hornet Mine, the railroad's primary ore supplier later in its operation.  Closure  The Iron Mountain mine shut down 1921 and an aerial tramway was built from the Hornet Mine directly to the Southern Pacific Railroad. With the closing of the last independent mine, common carrier status was abandoned on 5 February 1927 though limited service may have continued as late as 1929. The remaining line was salvaged by the early 1930s. Today much of the upper sections of the railroad bed is used by Iron Mountain Road.

It was planned to be an expanded version of the Vector-R rocket, more than doubling the payload capacity. After Vector Launch ceased operations in December 2019, the future development of the rocket is unofficially canceled. Design Vector-H would have used two stages, both 1.2 m in diameter, filled with Propylene/LOX propellant. The main body of the rocket was planned to be constructed using a lightweight carbon composite material. The launch vehicle's first stage would have been powered by six LP-1 LOX/propylene engines, delivering 81,000 newtons of force. The second stage would have been powered by one LP-3 LOX/propylene engine, delivering 4,400 newtons of force. The engines used a 3D-printed engine injector, designed with help from NASA's Science, Technology and Mission Directorate (STMD) Flight Opportunities program. This allows the injector to be produced as a single piece of hardware, instead of as individual components. The vehicle was also planned to include an optional third stage powered by a solid rocket motor. This would have allowed the upper stage to boost micro satellites into a higher orbit. = Vector-HE1 = The Vector-HE1 planned variant was to have the same body as the standard Vector-H but include an electric powered third stage. Intended usage Vector-H was designed to launch a payload to a Sun- synchronous orbit, suitable for CubeSats and other small payloads. The cost would have been less than , a price point that the company hoped will allow it to attract one hundred launches per year. Customers could have choose to encapsulate their spacecraft in payload fairings provided by the company, which could be easily attached to the rocket shortly before launch, in several different configurations, such as fitting CubeSats dispensers or multiple satellites in a single fairing. Vector would have used on-site payload integration for the early launches. However it expected to be able to integrate payloads at their Arizona and California Payload Facilities and ship them to their launch sites. Launch sites Mojave Spaceport Vector Space planned to use the LC-46 launch site in Florida, Spaceport Camden, and Pacific Spaceport Complex. Additionally Vector Space investigated adding more minimal infrastructure launch pads either located on land in the US, or to launch the rocket from barges on the ocean.

Set in Bangalore, the book is about an unnamed narrator who reminisces about his dysfunctional family's rags to riches story which results in troubling behavioural changes in each of them. The title is a made-up phrase, invented by the narrator's wife and her brother, which means \\"tangled up beyond repair\\". Ghachar Ghochar was included by The New York Times in their listing of the best books of 2017 and it was a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize and the International Dublin Literary Award. Plot The novel is the first-person account of an unnamed, sensitive young man. He regularly visits an old-world coffee shop in Bangalore where he is drawn towards a laconic waiter named Vincent, who the man believes possess prophetic abilities. The man reminisces about his bond with a young feminist named Chitra, whom he unceremoniously cast aside, but his mind mostly wanders towards his dysfunctional family, consisting of his parents, uncle, and a divorced, elder sister. He recollects the rags to riches story of his family, and worries about the deteriorating relationship between him and his wife, Anita, who is troubled by his lack of motivation and apathy towards his family's misdeeds.

K. Narayan, Anton Chekhov and Machado de Assis and found the unnamed narrator to be reminiscent of the protagonist in Ivan Goncharov’s Russian novel Oblomov. Lucy Scholes of The Independent too took note of the comparisons to Chekhov and wrote that \\"brevity serves Shanbhag’s storytelling to great effect, not least because much of what makes the narrative so gripping lies in what he leaves unsaid.\\" Reviewing the book for The Globe and Mail, Jade Colbert found the unnamed narrator to be \\"a superfluous man of the type Chekhov might recognize\\" and commended Shanbhag for subtlety conveying the troubled \\"gender dynamic\\" in India. Preti Taneja of the New Statesman took note of the book's feminist themes and wrote, \\"Perur’s translation captures the heartbreaking achievement of Shanbhag’s writing: to present, in a line or two, a body and mind coming of age in a society that casts violence as tenderness, ownership as love.\\" Writing for Hindustan Times, Prajwal Parajuly praised Shanbhag for finding emotional depth in his sparse prose. The New York Times included Ghachar Ghochar in their literary critics' listing of the best books of 2017. The book was longlisted for the International Dublin Literary Award in 2017 and was a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize in 2018.

It is based in Bristol but also has offices in Newcastle, Southampton, and South Africa. Founded in 2007 the company is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). It specialises in motor vehicle insurance and currently operates under the trade names GoSkippy, Footprint, Plato Insurance Services, and Vavista. Also previously Solid Insurance (2013), Business Choice Direct (2014-16) and others. It is closely related to Gibraltar-based Southern Rock Insurance which is the main underwriter for Eldon and also controlled by Banks. History The company was incorporated in August 2007 with John Gannon and Paul Chase-Gardener as founding directors. Michael Lee became a director shortly after and was the managing director in 2009, when said that the company had a staff of 160 and customer base of 250,000. Eldon's parent company was then the Gibraltar-based Southern Rock Holdings, which also owns Southern Rock Insurance. In 2010 the company website identified it as a Newcastle-based provider of motor claims management services on behalf of Southern Rock Insurance. Lee, who co-founded Southern Rock Holdings and had also served as managing director of Southern Rock Insurance, resigned his directorship in April 2011 to move to Hastings Direct. At the time, the trio of Banks, Chase-Gardener and Gannon were also the three executive directors of Bristol-based Brightside Group and owned 72% of Southern Rock Insurance, growing the group out of Commercial Vehicle Direct which they co-founded in 2001. The launch of the GoSkippy brand six months after Banks' departure as chief executive at Brightside in 2012 preceded a bitter dispute including legal action between Brightside, Southern Rock and Eldon. Gannon left at the end of August 2012, and by the end of the year the company began leasing office space on the Cribbs Causeway development in Bristol to house the GoSkippy operation and Banks subsequently hired a number of Brightside's staff. Banks became a director upon the departure of Gannon, and Chase- Gardener also departed in February 2013. As Banks and Gannon sold Brightside shares, Chase-Gardener swapped all his shares in Rock Holdings to increase his Brightside interest, also resigning from the group's other companies. On 26 February 2013 ownership of Eldon transferred to another group 70% owned by Banks, and received authorisation as a UK insurance broker at the start of April. According to Eldon's publicly-filed accounts, the transfer of ownership was achieved by first issuing almost £2.2m of new shares to the company's ultimate parent, Rock Holdings in a debt for equity deal in February. Those shares and the original 100 were then purchased by the newly-created, Isle of Man-based, ICS Risk Solutions in July for £7.5m. This did not affect control of Eldon as Arron Banks was then majority shareholder in both parent companies. Banks was forced to resign from Eldon in September 2013 and Southern Rock Insurance the following year, as part of an agreement with Gibraltarian regulators also accepting a \\"period of ban or self-exclusion from other insurance directorships\\" after they found Southern Rock to be trading while technically insolvent. Banks was replaced as a director by his Hong Kong-based brother Johnathan. Just before Christmas 2013, the company's auditors, Baker Tilly LLP resigned, reporting that the relationship had broken-down because \\"by failing to supply accurate information, management is imposing a limitation of scope on our work.\\" Banks has pointed to a conflict of interest. By early 2014 Eldon had launched the Footprint brand to sell van and motorbike policies and Business Choice Direct for commercial insurance. At the end of the year it began a partnership to sell insurance under the Debenhams brand. Eldon's new holding company ICS Risk Solutions, in 2015 also paid Southern Rock Insurance (which continues to be the main underwriter for Eldon) approximately £77m for rights to some of its future income, enabling it meet its obligation under solvency regulations. Brightside and Southern Rock reached an undisclosed out of court settlement in May 2015 bringing to a close their disputes relating to intellectual property, breaches of trading agreements and breaches of terms of business agreements. The following month Eldon sent call centre workers home while it trailed moving their work to South Africa, stating that it was \\"entering into a period of consultation with up to 200 members of staff across the business\\". Subsequently, 174 employees were made redundant at the Newcastle and Bristol offices. Eldon is also 50% owner of a joint venture called Vavista, which began trading in 2015 and provides \\"health and wellbeing programmes\\" with its insurance policies. It also has a 49% shareholding in Legal Protection Group, launched in 2016, which sells legal protection insurance, legal services and emergency assistance products. In October 2016 another new company, Somerset Bridge was created to act as managing general agent in order to diversify the panel of insurers Eldon has access to. In November the Business Choice Direct brand was moved to a newly created subsidiary company of which Eldon owns 51%. According to the company website they also moved into new offices in Eastleigh. During 2017 Eldon moved its offices in Newcastle into larger premises. Late in the year, it was reported that Banks intends to float the company on the public stock market in 2018. However the professor of finance at Manchester Business School called Banks' reported £250m valuation \\"highly ambitious\\". =Leave.EU= Elizabeth (Liz) Bilney who became a director shortly before Paul Chase- Gardener resigned, was reported to be the CEO in 2017 and was also in charge at Leave.EU during the Brexit campaign. Andy Wigmore was also a director at the time (December 2015 until April 2018). The company's Bristol headquarters was also the HQ for Leave.EU. Brittany Kaiser, a former director of Cambridge Analytica has said that when she visited Leave.EU HQ in late 2015 she saw Eldon employees staffing a call centre for the campaign. Adding that she thought the staff, most who had never participated in politics before, were calling leads or current customers of Eldon. In August 2016 the Leave.EU campaign announced a sponsorship deal with the Goskippy brand and offering a 10% discount on insurance. From June 2017 the Goskippy brand began appearing alongside that of Leave.EU on the campaign's Facebook and Twitter posts, including one featuring a photo of the burning Grenfell Tower stating \\"An amnesty for Grenfell illegal immigrants? Absolutely not! The law is the law.\\" The Guardian reported in April 2018 that the UK Information Commissioner's Office was investigating whether Eldon shared data with the Leave.EU campaign. Although Banks had previously admitted advertising insurance products to campaign supporters, he stated \\"Eldon has never given or used any data to Leave.EU. They are separate entities with strong data control rules. And vice versa.\\" In November 2018 the Information Commissioner took enforcement action against Eldon Insurance and Leave.EU for breaches of the Data Protection Act, fining them a total of £135,000. https://www.theguardian.com/uk- news/live/2018/nov/06/information-commissioner-to-levy-fines-against-leave-eu- live Mark Boleat became Chairman of Eldon in June 2019. Eldon's Companies House Filing Finances During 2013 Eldon sold 113,000 policies and recorded a £239,000 pre-tax profit on a revenue of £12.8m including income of £9m from services sold to Southern Rock Insurance, but paying £11.4m to Rock Services, another UK company that Banks holds a directorship with. By 2015 Eldon achieved a £284,000 profit on a revenue of £33.7m with income of £27.7m from Southern Rock and paying £27.5m to Rock Services. Rock Holdings Ltd, another holding company based on the Isle of Man, is the parent of both Rock Services and Southern Rock Holdings. Rock Services' main activity seems to be \\"recharge of goods and services\\" with Southern Rock Insurance. In 2016 operating profit was £253,000 but restructuring costs led to a loss of approximately £22,000 despite an increase in revenue to £47.3m from improved sales of 299,000 new policies and 90,000 renewals. That year saw a reduced income from Southern Rock of £22.1m but an increased £39.5m paid to Rock Services. The company's underlying profitability is difficult to assess because of a practice of recording administration expenses that closely track turnover. At the same time Southern Rock posted a loss of £32m in 2016, the fifth of seven years since 2010 it has made multimillion-pound losses on its core underwriting business and its solvency ratio dropped from 135% (2015) to 103% in 2016. According to Banks Eldons's profits leapt to £16.7m for the first half of 2017, saying that the company's business had been transformed by the same AI technology used in the Brexit campaign.

It is listed as timetable route 636 and integrated in the Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund as line 16.  History The planning of a connection to Friedberg as a continuation of the Homburg Railway began as early as 1868. However, it was not clear whether the connection to the Main-Weser Railway or a line to the Taunus would be built first. It was decided to build the Usingen Railway (Usinger Bahn), now called the Taunusbahn (Taunus Railway). Construction of the Friedrichsdorf–Friedberg link began in 1898 and the line was put into operation on 15 July 1901. The trains started at the terminus of Homburg vor der Höhe (also called Homburg Neu (new) station) on the lower Louisenstraße, which had been the starting point of the Usingen Railway since 1895. At the request of the emperor, Wilhelm II and to increase the capacity of the line from Frankfurt to Bad Homburg and from Friedrichsdorf to Friedberg, the line was upgraded to two tracks between 1907 and 1912 and a through station was built in Bad Homburg. The Erlenbach Bridge in Burgholzhausen, which was built as an arch bridge in 1897. Behind it and clearly visible is the attached reinforced concrete bridge for the second track. After the upgrade of the line, it was used by the trains of the Bad Nauheim–Wiesbaden railway (Bäderbahn), consisting of Eilzüge (fast-stopping trains) from Wiesbaden via Höchst and Bad Homburg to Bad Nauheim and a daily pair of Durchgangszüge (through trains) on the Berlin–Wiesbaden route. Due to decreasing profitability, the second track was dismantled after the end of the First World War. With the takeover by the Nazis, it was restored for the planned Friedberg–Hungen–Alsfeld–Hersfeld line. During the Second World War, a bridge at the entrance to Friedberg station that carried the second track to the Main-Weser Railway was destroyed. Subsequently, the second track was dismantled, starting with the Friedberg–Rosbach section, which was completed by 1950, and later with the Rosbach–Friedrichsdorf section, which was completed by 1968. This also made the block post at Straßheim at the original ladder junction at the entrance to the station superfluous. Based on the width of the embankment and the bridges, the location of the former second track is still largely recognisable and a piece of it was maintained as a catch point at the junction to the industrial siding in Rosbach. The bridge over the line to Hanau still exists and it now carries a freight connection from the Main- Weser Railway to the goods yard above the station. While the Frankfurt–Friedrichsdorf section was electrified and signalling control was transferred to the new centralised relay interlocking in Bad Homburg, the mechanical interlocking on this line was initially preserved and Rosbach was rebuilt in 1985 as a halt (Haltepunkt, that is without points). Also the sections of track became more operationally distinct at the end of the 20th century: the tight timing and the introduction of S-Bahn electric multiple units to Friedrichsdorf contrasted with the operations over the Friedrichsdorf–Friedberg line, which were mainly consisted of push-pull trains composed of Silberling (n-coaches) hauled by V 100 locomotives and Uerdingen railbuses; these were replaced by class 628 diesel multiple units, but services ran ever less frequently. The class 628 sets when not operating were usually stored outside Friedrichsdorf station towards Seulberg on a track to a no longer connected marshalling yard hump. With the commencement of S-Bahn operations to Friedrichsdorf and also to Friedberg, the normal Friedberg–Bad Homburg–Frankfurt through services were finally discontinued, although some long-distance trains still used the line. A 30 or 60-minute interval service was only re-introduced with the establishment of the Rhine-Main- Verkehrsverbund. After previous considerations of closing the line, the Butzbach-Licher Eisenbahn (BLE), a subsidiary of the Hessische Landesbahn, took over operations on 24 May 1998. New Stadler GTW railcars were procured for this operation. Due to its success and rising passenger numbers, there were also plans to restore the second track or even to electrify it. Only a few bridges would have had to be widened. A footbridge in Friedrichsdorf parallel to Färberstraße was increased in the meantime as part of its renewal to allow for a possible overhead line. However, more economical modernisation of the line was chosen. At the beginning of 2002, the tracks were completely renewed with Y-shaped sleepers. The stations were also renovated and a new station, Friedberg Süd, was added. The Rosbach vor der Höhe station, which is about halfway along it, was upgraded to become the crossing station, where trains could pass. The crossing in Rodheim was abandoned and the station was rebuilt as a halt with a single track. Finally, the signalling technology was modernised. Thus, the railway was downgraded from a main line to a branch line. For part of the construction work, traffic had to be blockaded for several weeks. On 21 April 2002, the re-commissioning was celebrated with two commuter trains shuttling over the line (a steam train and a GTW set). Next day, regular services commenced under a new timetable. This included not only an extended period when half-hourly services ran on weekdays but also a full service on the weekend. In addition, some connection times at the end stations were changed. The replacement of the bridge over the former Federal Highway 3 at the halt of Friedberg Süd was carried out in July 2017 during a three-week full closure of the line.  Route The line now begins in the Friedrichsdorf station, where the Taunus Railway branches off. The railway runs on a wide turn to the right to the east. After crossing autobahn 5 the line reaches the halt of Friedrichsdorf-Burgholzhausen. The halt and former train station of Rosbach-Rodheim is located in the Wetterau after a level crossing; until 1992 it was often used for the loading of sugar beet as is typical in the Wetterau. This is followed by Rosbach vor der Höhe, now classified as a full station. Since 1987, there has been an industrial siding to the REWE Group warehouse, which has not been operated since 2000 and is now overgrown. The connecting points were upgraded in 2015. The is a second level crossing within the station area. Located on the edge of Friedberg is the newest halt on the line, Friedberg Süd. Here, until 2010, there was an industrial siding with an alternative access point on the right (to the south), which was still connected, but was no longer used. Since the embankment is relatively high, the actual track was reached by a zig zag. Like the REWE warehouse, the siding was integrated into the new interlocking technology by axle counter. After the former US barracks (Ray Barracks) the railway reaches Friedberg station, where it connects with the Main-Weser Railway. Before that, until the station was resignalled with an electronic interlocking, an industrial siding ran to the left (the town side/west) to Raiffeisen and the Ray Barracks. GTW 2/6 set in Rosbach vor der Höhe station The trains from Friedrichsdorf stop in Friedberg mostly at the bay platform 1a, rarely at the adjacent through platform 1\\\\. In Friedrichsdorf, trains mainly stop at track 4, rarely at the neighbouring track 5. Apart from the terminal stations, all platforms have a height of 55 centimetres and are barrier-free. Upgrading of Friedrichsdorf is being considered, but this is difficult because of the S-Bahn services that stop there. The signals at Rosbach station and two level crossings in Rosbach and Rodheim are controlled via an electronic interlocking of the Sig L 90 class from a workstation at the signal box in Bad Homburg (on the Homburg Railway) and more precisely under direct traffic control mode with train control messages transmitted over analogue train radio. The entrance signal for Friedrichsdorf, like the whole station, is controlled by a relay interlocking directed from the Bad Homburg signal box. On the approach to Friedberg, a semaphore signal was formerly controlled by the local electro- mechanical signal box; on 25 October 2015, it was replaced by Ks signals (the most modern German standard for colour light signals) as part of its integration into the Friedberg electronic interlocking.  Operations The line is maintained by DB Netze and operated by HLB Hessenbahn GmbH until 2019. GTW 2/6 sets are used as rolling stock. The vehicles have an entry height of 55 centimetres, which is appropriate for the platforms at the various stations between the termini and are partially equipped with toilets. The densest service frequency is in the peak hour with a 30-minute interval with crossings in Rosbach. Prospects As part of the possible electrification of the Taunus Railway, the RB 16 service is to be extended to provide capacity at Bad Homburg. This would require Rodheim station to be restored as a crossing point to optimise connections.

The company was founded in February 2007 by Segun Adebutu, a Nigerian entrepreneur. It provides services to the oil and gas industry. It is mainly involved in the refining, storage, distribution and retail of petroleum products in Nigeria and Africa. Petrolex is best known for starting in December 2017, the construction of a 3.6 billion dollar high capacity refinery and Sub-Saharan Africa’s largest tank farm as part of its Mega Oil City project in Ogun State, Nigeria. Background Petrolex CEO, Adebutu started an oil and fuel trading business around 2005 but showed interest in “mid-stream infrastructure” for $330 million. His experience in family business, laid the foundation for new ideas in his business career. Over the years, Adebutu was involved in bold projects including oil and gas, solid minerals, construction and maritime. This background inspired Adebutu to replicate similar practices with his new initiative Petrolex Oil & Gas Ltd. In December 2017, Petrolex announced its plan to build a $3.6 billion refinery plant with an output capacity of 250,000 barrels a day. The company is currently working on the “front-end engineering design” and will complete construction in 2021. This initiative is part of a larger Government program to end petroleum products imports in two years. With support from partners, Petrolex Group has invested over $330 million in the Ibefun tank farm with a 600,000 million litres monthly capacity. The farm was commissioned by the Vice President of Nigeria Yemi Osinbajo, as part of phase one of a 10-year expansion program. This phase would ease the Apapa and Ibafon tanker traffic gridlock, a source of anxiety for stakeholders.  Petrolex Mega Oil City project Petrolex provides services in refining, storage, distribution and retailing of petroleum products. The company intends to be listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange in the coming decade. The company launched the planning, design and development of the Petrolex Mega Oil City in Ibefun, Ogun State in 2012. The complex spreads over 101 square kilometres, about 10 percent the size of Lagos State. It houses a residential estate for staff, an army barracks, 30 loading gantries for product disbursement, and a 4,000 truck capacity trailer park with accommodation for drivers. The Oil City project is the original idea of Segun Adebutu, CEO of Petrolex and son of the Nigerian entrepreneur Sir Kesington Adebutu. Its goal is to create the largest petrochemical industrial estate in Sub-Saharan Africa. Upon completion, this estate will include a large capacity refinery, a tank farm, a liquefied petroleum gas processing plant, a lubricant facility and raw material industries (ex. fertiliser plants). The company has also negotiated the addition of 12,000 acres to expand the Oil City. Operations overview =Downstream operations= Petrolex downstream operations include the processing of petroleum products, the supply and distribution of gas oil, kerosene; and the retail marketing of specific oil products. Petrolex has built a storage-tank farm and other “mid-stream infrastructure” for $330 million. The company is connecting its infrastructure to the Nigeria System 2B pipeline at Mosimi to support supply and distribution of petroleum products around the country. This infrastructure includes a procurement of barges, tug boats and a daughter vessel.

Students organized the event, which included a march from the North Park Blocks to Pioneer Courthouse Square where a rally featured speakers, a performance by rock band Portugal. The Man, and a surprise appearance by rapper Black Thought of hip-hop band The Roots. The protest was the city's largest since the January 2017 Women's March on Portland; the Portland Police Bureau estimated a crowd size of 12,000. Background March for Our Lives was a student-led demonstration in support of a tightening of U.S. gun control laws on March 24, 2018, in Washington, D.C., with more than 800 sibling events throughout the United States and around the world. Student organizers from Never Again MSD planned the march in collaboration with the nonprofit organization Everytown for Gun Safety. The event followed the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, which many media outlets described as a possible tipping point for gun control legislation. Protesters urged the introduction of universal background checks on gun sales, the raising of the federal minimum age for gun ownership and possession to 21, the closure of the gun show loophole, the restoration of the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban, and a ban on the sale of high-capacity magazines in the U.S. Turnout across the country was estimated at between 1.2 to 2 million people, making it one of the largest protests in American history. Local organizers and planning Local student organizers included: Eliana Andrews; Alyssa Diaz; Zoe Dumm; Alexandria Goddard; Finn Jacobson; Calum Nguyen; Sophie Rupp; Ryan Tran; Kien Truong; Tyler White; and Ellie Younger. According to the Portland Police Bureau, organizers obtained proper permits for the demonstration. The rally was scheduled to start at 10am and end by 2pm. The Portland-based rock band Portugal. The Man contacted organizers and offered to help, and practiced with a local choir prior to the concert. On the event's Facebook page in the lead-up to the event, around 9,000 people indicated plans to attend, and approximately 20,000 people had expressed interest in participating. The Portland Bureau of Transportation planned to close all lanes of West Burnside Street from Broadway to 9th Avenue, as well as Southwest Broadway from Burnside to Yamhill Street, from approximately 10:30am to noon. The agency and event organizers also encouraged attendees and other downtown visitors to use public transit and to expect delays in the vicinity of the march route. The MAX Light Rail stations Pioneer Square South and Pioneer Square North were temporarily closed, and several bus lines had detours for a few hours. Online taxi firm Lyft offered march participants free rides in Portland and 49 other U.S. cities. The route of the march was decided upon by event organizers and police, and plans to have safety monitors present were made. Demonstration Demonstrators gathered at the North Park Blocks Participants gathered at the North Park Blocks and marched to Pioneer Courthouse Square via Burnside and Broadway. The rally began on time; protestors started marching at 10:30am. The march route was less than long and lasted approximately 90 minutes. At Pioneer Courthouse Square, organizers held a moment of silence and rang a bell 17 times to commemorate victims of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. Starting around 11:30am, eight local students ranging in age from grades 8 to 12 delivered speeches and performed songs and poems advocating gun control and school safety. They encouraged attendees to vote, remain politically active, and hold their politicians accountable. KOIN described the students' speeches as \\"articulate, informed, engaging and captivating\\". Protestors at Pioneer Courthouse Square, the march route's end location Portugal. The Man performed \\"So American\\", \\"Feel It Still\\", and Oasis \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\", and gave a \\"rousing\\" performance of Bob Dylan's \\"The Times They Are a-Changin'\\" with a choir of students from Vernon Elementary School. Lead singer and guitarist John Gourley said March for Our Lives' mission is nonpartisan. Rapper Black Thought of The Roots made an onstage surprise appearance with the band. The protest was Portland's largest since the Women's March on Portland in January 2017, with more than 10,000 participants. The Portland Police Bureau's Traffic Division estimated 12,000 people attended. Event organizers said there were between 20,000 and 25,000 demonstrators. The Oregonian reported a crowd estimate of 12,000, and noted the presence of all age groups. Willamette Week said \\"tens of thousands\\" of people were in attendance and described the crowd as \\"massive and diverse\\", consisting of \\"families, teachers, grandparents and groups of students of all ages\\". Counter-protestors, including members of Patriot Prayer, were present but the event was peaceful. Suzanne Bonamici and Earl Blumenauer, U.S. representatives for Oregon's 1st and 3rd congressional districts, respectively, participated in the march. Also in attendance were 15 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School alumni living in Portland and teachers from Umpqua Community College, where nine people were killed in a mass shooting in 2015.

This generalization is due to Igor Shafarevich.I. R. Shafarevich, Basic algebraic geometry, Springer Study Edition, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1977, Translated from the Russian by K. A. Hirsch; Revised printing of Grundlehren der mathematischen Wissenschaften, Vol. 213, 1974. Motivation Given a polynomial equation or a system of polynomial equations it is often useful to compute or to bound the number of solutions without computing explicitly the solutions. In the case of a single equation, this problem is solved by the fundamental theorem of algebra, which asserts that the number of complex solutions is bounded by the degree of the polynomial, with equality, if the solutions are counted with their multiplicities. In the case of a system of polynomial equations in unknowns, the problem is solved by Bézout's theorem, which asserts that, if the number of complex solutions is finite, their number is bounded by the product of the degrees of the solutions. Moreover, if the number of solutions at infinity is also finite, then the product of the degrees equals the number of solutions counted with multiplicities and including the solutions at infinity. However, it is rather common that the number of solutions at infinity is infinite. In this case, the product of the degrees of the polynomials may be much larger than the number of roots, and better bounds are useful. Multi-homogeneous Bézout theorem provides such a better root when the unknowns may be split into several subsets such that the degree of each polynomial in each subset is lower than the total degree of the polynomial. For example, let p_1, \\\\ldots, p_{2n} be polynomials of degree two which are of degree one in indeterminate x_1, \\\\ldots x_n, and also of degree one in y_1, \\\\ldots y_n. (that is the polynomials are bilinear. In this case, Bézout's theorem bounds the number of solutions by :2^{2n}, while the multi-homogeneous Bézout theorem gives the bound (using Stirling's approximation) :\\\\binom{2n}{n}= \\\\frac{(2n)!}{(n!)^2}\\\\sim \\\\frac{2^{2n}}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi n}}. Statement A multi-homogeneous polynomial is a polynomial that is homogeneous with respect to several sets of variables. More precisely, consider positive integers n_1, \\\\ldots, n_k, and, for , the n_i+1 indeterminates x_{i,0}, x_{i,1}, \\\\ldots, x_{i,n}. A polynomial in all these indeterminates is multi-homogeneous of multi-degree d_1, \\\\ldots, d_k, if it is homogeneous of degree d_i in x_{i,0}, x_{i,1}, \\\\ldots, x_{i,n}. A multi- projective variety is a projective subvariety of the product of projective spaces :\\\\mathbb P_{n_1}\\\\times \\\\cdots\\\\times \\\\mathbb P_{n_k}, where \\\\mathbb P_n denote the projective space of dimension . A multi-projective variety may be defined as the set of the common nontrivial zeros of an ideal of multi- homogeneous polynomials, where \\"nontrivial\\" means that x_{i,0}, x_{i,1}, \\\\ldots, x_{i,n} are not simultaneously 0, for each . Bézout's theorem asserts that homogeneous polynomials of degree d_1, \\\\ldots, d_n in indeterminates define either an algebraic set of positive dimension, or a zero-dimensional algebraic set consisting of d_1\\\\cdots d_n points counted with their multiplicities. For stating the generalization of Bézout's theorem, it is convenient to introduce new indeterminates t_1, \\\\ldots, t_k, and to represent the multi-degree d_1, \\\\ldots, d_k by the linear form \\\\mathbf d=d_1t_1+\\\\cdots + d_kt_k. In the following, \\"multi-degree\\" will refer to this linear form rather than to the sequence of degrees. Setting n=n_1+\\\\cdots +n_k, the multi- homogeneous Bézout theorem is the following. With above notation, multi- homogeneous polynomials of multi-degrees \\\\mathbf d_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\mathbf d_n define either an multi-projective algebraic set of positive dimension, or a zero-dimensional algebraic set consisting of points, counted with multiplicities, where is the coefficient of :t_1^{n_1}\\\\cdots t_k^{n_k} in the product of linear forms :\\\\mathbf d_1 \\\\cdots \\\\mathbf d_n. Non-homogeneous case The multi-homogeneous Bézout bound on the number of solutions may be used for non-homogeneous systems of equations, when the polynomials may be (multi)-homogenized without increasing the total degree. However, in this case, the bound may be not sharp, if there are solutions \\"at infinity\\". Without insight on the problem that is studied, it may be difficult to group the variables for a \\"good\\" multi-homogenization. Fortunately, there are many problems where such a grouping results directly from the problem that is modeled. For example, in mechanics, equations are generally homogeneous or almost homogeneous in the lengths and in the masses.

The core of the district, within the block bounded by Saginaw, Lawrence, Pike, and Wayne Streets, was originally listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. A boundary increase creating the present boundaries was listed in 1989. The district includes the Eagle Theater and the Grinnell Brothers Music House, also listed on the National Register. History Pontiac was founded in 1818-19 by a group of investors. In 1819, Oakland County was established, with a county seat at Pontiac. By 1820, Pontiac had a dam, a sawmill, a flour mill, and a blacksmith shop. A courthouse was constructed in 1824, and by 1830 the city of Pontiac was clearly the center of commerce for the county. In 1840, the business district was completely leveled by fire. Buildings were rebuilt in the district, including a series of buildings in the heart of the district, facing North Saginaw between West Pike and West Lawrence Streets, which are still extant. The industrial growth of the city only really began in 1886 when a carriage factory was established by local businessman Charles V. Taylor. By 1900, three quarters of the male workers in the city were employed in the carriage and buggy trade. By 1907 these factories were being converted to serves the automobile industry, and in 1909 General Motors absorbed many of the independent manufacturers, leading to an explosive growth in population. This growth led to a rebuilding of the central business district in the first three decades of the twentieth century, and much of the district contains buildings constructed during this time. Description The Pontiac Commercial Historic District contains parts of sixteen blocks in downtown Pontiac including the single block within the original 1984 district. This block contains sixteen buildings, of which fourteen contribute to the historic nature of the district. The remainder of the district contains an additional 84 buildings, of which 53 contribute to the historic nature of the district. =Original 1984 district= The original portion of the district designated in 1984 is located within a single block bounded by Saginaw, Lawrence, Pike, and Wayne Streets. The buildings are all commercial brick structures of two or three stories in height, fronting on the sidewalk. The eastern half of the block, fronting on Saginaw, was completely rebuilt some time after time 1840 fire and prior to 1865. Nearly all of these buildings, the oldest in the district, remain, running from 1 to 21 North Saginaw and interrupted only by a single non-contributing structure at 17 N. Saginaw. Many of the buildings were remodeled in the 1910s and 1920s, resulting in a breadth of architectural styles represented in the facades. Other buildings on the block, fronting on Lawrence and Pike, were originally constructed in the 1910s and 1920s. =Boundary increase= The buildings in the 1989 boundary increase were primarily constructed during Pontiac's boom years of 1900-1930, although the district does include some structures from the late 19th century. The buildings span a series of architectural styles, from a Second Empire and Late Victorian brick commercial buildings from the 19th century to Neo-Classical Revival, Renaissance Revival, Adamesque, Romanesque, Gothic Revival, and Art Deco buildings from the 20th.

Opened in 1947, it was the first Tiki themed restaurant and bar in Tucson, Arizona located in the Miracle Mile Historic District. History In 1947 the architectural firm of Blanton and Cole were commissioned to design the exotic Pago-Pago Restaurant and Cocktail Lounge, a nightclub at 2201 N. Oracle Road (along the Miracle Mile Strip) for business partners Bob McAffee and Homer Moore. The project included design consultation from restaurant designers Clif and Lou Sawyer (who was involved in numerous other tiki themes bars including Link Paola's Outrigger in Honolulu, Trade Winds in Wagon Wheel Junction - Oxnard, California, Moongate in Los Angeles, the South Seas in Anchorage Alaska, and the Bikini in Phoenix, and The Lanai in San Mateo, California) and was built by general contractor F.B. Pacheco. The Pago Pago was a one-story boxy, rectangular building that featured an entrance porch designed to evoke a Polynesian palapa. The circular entrance walls were adorned with faux Polynesian deco murals. Signs made of large individual letters outlined in neon spelled out “Pago Pago”; on both the east and north walls. The lounge featured a long, curving bar with a painted night sky and irregularly arranged booths. The building was a featured location in the 1956 MGM movie A Kiss Before Dying. The restaurant tagline was \\"It's Topical! It's Tropical, It's the Pago Pago.\\"\\" In the late 20th century the building was heavily modified but the original palm trees and building form survived. The building awaits restoration.https://www.tucsonaz.gov/files/preservation/Oracle_Area_Context_Study.pdf Pago Pago cocktail It is unknown if the Pago Pago created a drink named after itself when it first opened. One recipe from circa 1963 for the Lounge's eponymous tiki drink calls for: *1 oz dark Jamaican rum *1 oz orange juice *3/4 oz white grapefruit juice *3/4 oz lime juice *3/4 oz honey 1 dash Angostura bitters Blended without ice, poured into pilsner glass filled with crushed ice. Other themed cocktails In addition to the Pago Pago cocktail, the lounge developed a series of exotic tiki drinks which included: * Deep Purple * Dragonet * La Rhumba * Lupa-Lupa * Red Opu * Samoa of Samoa * Sarong References Category:Buildings and structures in Pima County, Arizona Category:Buildings and structures in Tucson, Arizona Category:Restaurants established in 1947 Category:Tucson, Arizona Category:National Register of Historic Places in Pima County, Arizona Category:1947 establishments in Arizona Category:Defunct companies based in Arizona Tucson Inn Category:Economy of Tucson, Arizona Category:1940s architecture in the United States Category:Modernist architecture in Arizona Category:Tourist attractions in Tucson, Arizona Category:Historic district contributing properties in Arizona Category:U.S. Route 80 ","title":"Pago Pago Lounge"},{"id":"56956160","text":"HCTU is an aminium coupling reagent used in peptide synthesis.

It is located between Mons and Charleroi, about south of Brussels. It was a fully fledged municipality before the fusion of the Belgian municipalities. It is in size. Etymology The origin of the name Trivières probably derives from the Latin word trivium, meaning three paths. Three roads intersect at the centre of Trivières, one leading east to , one north to Strépy, and one southwest to Estinnes. Three rivers, the Haine, the Princess of Rieu, and the Estinnes, also cross the village. Another, probably legendary, suggested origin of the name is that it derives from the Belgic tribe Treveri, said to have been massacred in the area by the Roman legions of Tiberius and Nero Claudius Drusus. History Trivières dates to at least the Roman era, and has a rich archaeological history. Excavations have uncovered an artificial harbour that was dug out by the Romans to facilitate the trade of lime, as well as a lime kiln. The village is also the site of the most important known Merovingian necropolis in Belgium, dating from 480 to 610 AD. A hectare in size, the cemetery contains 385 graves split between two sections, one reserved for women and one reserved for men. The former section has yielded skeletons buried with gold jewelry. The latter, containing larger tombs than those for the women, has been found to contain axes, fibulae, arrows, and spears. A Frankish iron helmet was also found there, similar in design to the Anglo-Saxon Shorwell helmet found on the Isle of Wight in England. The helmet is particularly rare in that it is made of iron, rather than bronze. From 1400 to 1754 the main seigneury of Trivières was held by several prominent families, including some who traced their descent to the kings of Ireland. In the 18th century the ground began to be exploited for coal; the village also contained several breweries and a small construction store. Today, Trivières is in size, and is part of the municipality of La Louvière. Trivières was itself a municipality until the fusion of the Belgian municipalities. Before it was restructured in the 1970s, it had a population of 3,635 people. Afterwards, in 1996, it had a population of 3,704 people. In the centre of the town is the church of Saint Martin. It replaced a 12th century church demolished around 1870 to 1875.

Unveiled 27 March 2018, they succeed the Huawei P10 in the company's P series line. The P20 line is distinguished primarily by its cameras, which Huawei promoted as featuring artificial intelligence technology to perform automated enhancements to images, and the P20 Pro featuring both a wide-angle 40-megapixel camera, and an 8-megapixel camera with optical zoom. Specifications =Hardware= The P20 is constructed with a metal chassis and glass backing, has a fingerprint reader on the front that can also be used for gesture navigation, and is available in various color finishes. Both the P20 and P20 Pro feature 1080p, 18.7:9 aspect ratio \\"FullView\\" displays with a \\"notch\\" tab at the top-centre, with the P20 having a 5.8-inch LCD panel and the P20 Pro a 6.1-inch AMOLED panel. Both models include a Kirin 970 system- on-chip and 128 GB of non-expandable internal storage, with 4 GB of RAM for the base model and 6 for the Pro. The models feature 3320 and 4000 mAh batteries respectively; the P20 line does not support wireless charging. Both models have a USB-C port and do not include a headphone jack. Both models feature rear-facing Leica cameras. The P20 features a 12-megapixel colour sensor, while the P20 Pro features two cameras—a 40-megapixel wide-angle IMX600 sensor, and an 8-megapixel sensor with 3x optical zoom. By default, output from \\"quad pixels\\" on the P20 Pro's 40-megapixel sensor is pixel binned into 10-megapixel photos (\\"Light Fusion\\", similar to Nokia PureView's \\"pixel oversampling\\"), which is used to improve image quality and the brightness of low-light images, or for intentional monochrome photography. The camera configurations of both models additionally feature a 20-megapixel monochrome sensor, whose output can be used to help improve image quality. The camera software leverages artificial intelligence technologies such as object recognition for stabilization and performing automated enhancements to images (recognizing common scenes and photo subjects), while information from the various sensors and infrared is used for autofocus. The 24-megapixel front- facing camera also uses Light Fusion. =Software= The P20 ships with Android 8.1 \\"Oreo\\" with Huawei's EMUI interface and software suite. In December 2018, Huawei began to roll out an upgrade to Android 9.0 \\"Pie\\" with EMUI 9.0, adding features such as screen gesture-based navigation, Digital Balance (a dashboard for tracking and limiting device usage), HiVision (an augmented reality object recognition experience for the camera), and Password Vault among other features. In mid-2019, the P20 received a system update with EMUI 9.1 (introduced on its successor, the P30), which features performance improvements (including use of Huawei's Extendable Read-Only File System [EROFS] for system partitions), updates to the GPU Turbo mode, and other refinements. An upcoming update to Android 10 and EMUI 10 was announced for the P20. Reception CNET praised the design of the P20 Pro, noting that its \\"Twilight\\" color finish was reminiscent of when phones \\"dared to look different\\" in the early 2000s, but that its glass backing was likely to attract fingerprints. The P20 Pro's cameras were deemed to be competitive with other high-end devices, with low-light images being \\"consistently detailed\\", and having quality that exceeded those of the Samsung Galaxy S9+. However, it was argued that the automatic enhancement mode often resulted in oversaturated and unnatural-looking photos. NDTV noted that the P20 range lacked wireless charging or a 1440p display like its competition, and that the P20 Pro's Kirin 970 system-on-chip was comparable to the Snapdragon 835, but slightly behind the Exynos 9810 of the Samsung Galaxy S9 on CPU benchmarks. On graphics benchmarks, the P20 Pro was shown to have a frame rate advantage over its competitors due to its lower resolution. In conclusion, the S9 was deemed to be a better \\"all-round\\" phone, but the P20 Pro was best for users who wanted the \\"most versatile\\" cameras of a current smartphone. The Verge similarly praised its design for having many subtle details and a \\"satisfying sense of density that only Apple's iPhone X can match\\". Its display was considered to be competitive with those of the iPhone X and Galaxy S9, also noting its inclusion of display temperature adjustment based on lighting conditions, similarly to Apple's \\"True Tone\\" feature. Huawei's software was considered to be less \\"irritating\\" than Samsung Experience, and maturing beyond being a clone of iOS, although bugs were noted in its handling of the display notch on the stock software. The P20 Pro's cameras were deemed the company's best to- date, to have \\"shockingly impressive low-light performance\\" (outperforming the Pixel 2), and a long-exposure \\"Night\\" mode that \\"somehow manages to produce handheld photos that remain sharp, accurate, and practically noise-free\\", but noting Huawei's aggressive post-processing, and that the \\"Master AI\\" mode was inconsistent. In conclusion, it was argued that \\"Instead of gimmicks and gaudiness, the Huawei P20 Pro delivers refinement and efficiency. That's a major change for Huawei, which could previously be relied upon to be the fastest iPhone copycat in the East.\\" DxOMark found that the P20 Pro's cameras were \\"the biggest innovation we have seen in mobile imaging for quite some time\\" and \\"particularly good in low light, when zooming, and for bokeh simulation\\". Rating it on its camera benchmarks with a score of 109, it was, at the time, the highest score the site had ever awarded.

It was developed by Thai developer Yggdrazil Group. The game features horror elements drawn from Thai folklore. It is available on Windows and on VR devices. The game focuses on the main protagonist Tim. His life has drastically changed since his wife disappeared. One night, he wakes up in an unknown place. While trying to find an exit, he is chased by a female ghost. Players have to discover the mystery in Tim's house and find his missing wife Jane.  Gameplay  The game is about stealth and hiding. If the ghosts or demons find the player in their hiding spot, the player can do a quick time event to escape, or will otherwise be killed and the game will respawn to the last save point. Exploration is also important, which is complemented by the fact that many areas have no dangers. Instead the goal is to find diary pages, informative articles, or puzzle items. Development Home Sweet Home is developed by Yggdrazil Group, a visual effects company primarily working on film post-production. Home Sweet Home is the company's first venture into game development; the project was led by Sarut Tubloy. Development took about 2 years, and went through multiple major revisions. The team originally planned to make a mobile game, but changed to PC and restarted work after 7–8 months. They made another revision at 15 months, after receiving feedback from Steam Greenlight. They made another revision after releasing a demo on 16 November 2016, spending an extra three months on revising the story. Home Sweet Home has been planned as a series, and the story was written with possible sequels in mind.  Release  = Demo = The game demo was released on 16 November 2016, earning enthusiastic response. In the demo, the player plays as protagonist Chadchai Tubloy (Tim) who suddenly awakens in an unknown place. The player is occasionally chased by a ghost girl with a boxcutter who can teleport through portals of blood. The player explores the environment using stealth and solves some puzzles. The level ends when a shelf blocks the exit, followed by the aforementioned ghost girl providing a jump scare. = Full game release = The full game was released on Steam on 27 September 2017. It offers 3 hours of gameplay.  Reception  Home Sweet Home was positively received; critics commended the game's use of Thai mythological elements to create its frightening atmosphere.

It changed its name into Nankai Institute of Economics in 1931, and then established the tenet of the institute, which is to \\"know China and serve China\\". The systematic social research that the institute has conducted was ahead of its time in China. The Nankai Price Index, compiled in 1927, was the very first price index in China and the most important reference to the study of Chinese economy during that time, indicating that it was rather influential and of high academic value. The institute was then regarded as the authority of Chinese economic studies during the period of Republic of China (1912–1949). Nankai Institute of Economics is now affiliated to the School of Economics, and located at the Balitai campus of Nankai University, Nankai District, Tianjin.  History  Xiushan Hall, donated by Li Chun, the early office of NKIE = Early stage = In 1926, He Lian returned to China after receiving his doctor's degree from Yale University, and was offered a position by Zhang Boling, the principal of Nankai University, and Tao Menghe, the head of the social research's department of China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture. Tao Menghe invited He Lian to be the research adviser for the department. Although he declined the offer, He Lian was still interested in the idea and proposed to Zhang Boling that an independent research organization should be established, which was approved by Zhang Boling. On September 10, 1927, Nankai Committee of Sociology and Economics was founded under the support of Zhang Boling and He Lian, and it was the previous form of Nankai Institute of Economics. Its office was set in Xiushan Hall, Balitai. He Lian took the position of chief adviser of the committee. Because it was considered a specialized research institution, the committee focused its early studies on two aspects, the collection of books, journals and other materials about Chinese economy, written in Chinese and other languages, as well as the compilation of an anthology of Chinese economics which included editing and analyzing the statistics of Chinese economy. In 1928, Fang Xianting, a fellow student of He Lian's, returned to China to support Nankai University after receiving his doctorate of economics from Yale. He was officially employed as the chief researcher of the committee. Influence by Fang Xianting, the committee shifted its focus to the study of \\"the degree and the impact of China's industrialization\\" in the Tianjin region, which is China's first systematic research on social economics and earliest empirical research of economics. = Development = The first graduate graduation commemorative photo in 1937 In 1931, Nankai Committee of Sociology and Economics, together with Economic Studies under the School of Arts, formed the School of Economics, and the committee started to take on the role of an educational facility as well. From 1931 onwards, Nankai Institute of Economics made progress with impressive research results and its research conditions improved because of it. In the spring of 1934, the department of education of the nationalist government refused to register the School of Economics as an official institution and demanded its reorganization because the name of the school violated the regulations about \\"organizing university\\". Nankai University, therefore, had to withdraw the use of the name \\"School of Economics\\" in its official documents, and reuse the \\"Business School\\". The Economic Studies, which was previously subordinate to the School of Arts, was affiliated to the Business School. Meanwhile, because of other regulations on the establishment of institutes, the university set up \\"the Economic Department of Business School Institute\\", i.e., \\"Nankai Institute of Economics\\" (abbreviated NKIE). Later, Nankai did not follow up on the regulations of the government's department of education. Although it kept the accepted names in its official reports to the government, the university remained using the \\"School of Economics\\" and \\"Nankai Institute of Economics\\" in other occasions. The journal Nankai Index was created in the same year, and it received much attention from the academia in China and in other countries, because the journal was a reflection of Chinese economy at that period. In July 1935, NKIE started to accept postgraduate students, which were the first ones educated in China to receive master's degree of economics that were officially admitted by the department of education. In 1935, six institutions, including NKIE, Peking Union Medical College, Yenching University, Tsinghua University, University of Nanking, and China's Association for Mass Education, jointly established the \\"Association of Northern China's Countrysides Establishment\\", which was funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. He Lian was appointed as the chairman of the association and Fang Xianting the secretary. NKIE was then responsible for the training of people who could manage local governments, their financial problems and other cooperation organizations. = During the second Sino-Japanese war = The remains of NKIE's office after Xiushan Hall was bombed In 1936, before the war started, Zhang Boling took precautionary measures in case that Nankai University was assaulted by the Japanese army. Before the army took over Tianjin, Nankai Institute of Economics was relocated to the underground floor of Zhongshu Library in Chongqing Nankai Secondary School, and 21,000 books and research materials, which had been collected for the last dozen years, were put into 127 boxes and shipped towards south before the university was bombed. After years of transportation through Hong Kong, Haiphong and several other places, the boxes eventually arrived in Chongqing in 1940.During the war, NKIE moved south and relocated in Chongqing Nankai Secondary SchoolOn July 29, 1937, Nankai University was bombed by the Japanese army. The office of NKIE at Xiushan Hall was destroyed, but none of the faculty members were injured or dead. Since Nankai University and other universities coalesced and formed National Southwestern Associated University, NKIE then changed its name into Economic Studies under the Business School Institute of National Southwestern Associated University. By 1939, the institute had been reestablished at the library of Chongqing Nankai Secondary School, and it had also set up an agency in Kunming (where the Associated University was located). = During the Chinese civil war = In April 1946, Chiang Kai-shek signed the proposal to transform Nankai University from a private school into a national public university. On May 4, National Southwestern Associated University held its annual graduation ceremony. It then announced the disintegration of the university on July 31, and Nankai University moved back to Tianjin and resumed its operation. In December, NKIE returned to Tianjin, but many funds that it previously received from abroad such as Rockefeller Foundation and Institute of the Pacific Relations had stopped because of its status as a public university. The researches were therefore influenced due to the lack of financial support. In September 1947, after leaving the Kuomintang government, He Lian and Fang Xianting established an independent \\"Chinese Economic Research Institute\\" in Shanghai on the support of Zhou Zuomin and Dai Zimu, the chairman and the associate manager of Kincheng Banking Corporation, in order to retain the personnel of NKIE. This institute acted as a branch of NKIE, with Fang Xianting as its director, while the members were mostly previous employees at NKIE and other graduate students of NKIE. = From 1949 onwards = After 1949, since Marxian economics gained traction in mainland China, He Lian, Fang Xianting and other founders moved abroad one after another. Because it used to receive funds from foreign organizations like Rockefeller Foundation, Nankai Institute of Economics became a target of political oppression. It was demanded to be reformed, while many faculty members received unfair treatment. In 1952, after the reformation of higher education institutions, NKIE once stopped operating. In 1958, Hebei's Institute of Economics of Chinese Academy of Sciences was established on the basis of the old NKIE, but it was still located inside the campus of Nankai University. The independent Hebei's Institute of Economics kept its academic communication with the School of Economics of Nankai University, and many academic conferences were held among these institutions. In May 1959, the prime minister Zhou Enlai visited Nankai University, and he was in support of the operation of NKIE. He asked, \\"why won't He Lian return to China? He has every right to come back.\\" Besides this, Zhou Enlai also asked people to send his regards to He Lian and invite him to return when he met with guests from abroad. In 1962, Hebei's Institute of Economics was to be shut down, and Zhou Enlai instructed Nankai University to take over it and change its name back to Nankai Institute of Economics, with the director of the School of Economics Ji Taoda as its director, and both the dean of the School of Economics Teng Weizao and the associate director Tao Jikan as its associate directors. The institute then set up four research branches, i.e. Socialist Economy, U.S. Economy, Oceania Economy and History of Modern China's Economy. During the Cultural Revolution, the research at NKIE was often put into halts, and the research branches did not resume their works until 1973. In December 1979, Political Economics: Socialist Part, edited by the director of NKIE Gu Shutang, was officially published and became the widely-used textbook of economics among the universities in the northern China, so it was called the \\"northern edition\\". This book broke the frame of a typical Soviet Union's textbook, absorbed the newest research results and went through several revisions. It was then considered an influential volume by the educational sphere of economics in China. In 1984, NKIE started to work on the major state research project \\"the formation of planned price\\" and was authorized to grant doctorates to students. In 1987, the subdivision of Global Economy of NKIE became a separate Nankai Institute of International Economy. In 1988, proposed by the geographer Bao Juemin, the director of the Cultural Geography Studies of the Geographical Society of China, NKIE opened a new research branch of Economic Geography, which was the first research facility of economic geography set under an institute of economics. From 1994 to 1998, Chen Zongsheng took the position of the director of NKIE and focused the research on the problems of individual incomes and the transformation of economic system in developing countries. In 2002, the research branch of Urban and Regional Economy became the independent Institute of Urban and Regional Economy. On September 10, 2012, Nankai Institute of Economics celebrated its 85 years of operation. In October 2017, the previous director Chen Zongsheng won the eighth China's Economic Theory Innovation Award for his theory of \\"income distribution in China's economic transformation and development\\".  Academic researches  He Lian, the first director of NKIE He Lian, the founder of NKIE, believes that price is the center of all economic activities according to the theory of economics, while statistics and price index are \\"the barometer of economy\\" to observe the changing price and \\"examine the purchasing power of the currency\\", which should be \\"referred to when doing business\\". When Nankai Committee of Sociology and Economics was first established in September 1927, they decided to start their research with the compilation of a wholesale price index in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei. As the institute grew larger and the research area expanded, the index began to include quantity of import and export commodities and wholesale price in China; rate of foreign currencies in Tianjin and Shanghai; price of domestic currency, price of silver, customer price, price of essential commodities and living cost in Shanghai; wholesale price and living cost of workers in Tianjin; salary in large cities and counties; price of commodities in Chongqing during wartime, income of teachers, living costs of landlords, businessmen and workers in Chongqing; and industrial productivity in Northern China during wartime. Many of these indexes were important guides to study the economy in China during that period. For instance, the English economic historian Richard H. Tawney wrote Land and Labor in China during his visit to China from 1929 to 1930, making use of the materials and research results of NKIE.

She is the inventor of FoxFibre and founder of the company Natural Cotton Colours Inc. Fox invented the first species of environmentally friendly colored cotton that could be spun into thread on a machine. Fox has been called a \\"cotton pioneer\\" for her efforts regarding organic, colored cotton and heirloom wheat. Early life and education Fox was the sixth of seven children, born in 1959 in Woodside, California to two real estate agents. At the age of seven, her family moved to Menlo Park. Fox first became interested in cotton fibers at the age of 12. After purchasing her first spindle with babysitting money, she created various threads of cotton from household objects such as linen. In high school, an entomology teacher and then Stanford Ph.D. student, Elizabeth Wangari, inspired Fox to take an interest in insects. Wangari helped Fox secure an internship at Zoecon Corporation in Palo-Alto. Fox went on to major in biology and entomology at California State Polytechnic University at San Luis Obispo. After graduation, Fox joined the Peace Corps and travelled to The Gambia, West Africa in order to learn about the environmental factors harming local rice and peanut crops. It was here that Fox was first exposed, both socially and physically, to the dangers of pesticides such as DDT. Fox taught safety classes regarding the usage of pesticides but was forced to return home after becoming very sick (due to exposure). After her stint in the Peace Corps, Fox furthered her education by earning a master's degree in integrated pest management from the University of California at Riverside. =Inspiration to grow colored cotton= In the early 1980s, Fox began looking for a job. However, the economic downfall of the farming industry during this time period created a sparse job market. Fox first found work as a pollinator for a cotton breeder in California. During this job, Fox discovered a bag of seeds that produced brown, pest-resistant cotton. After a suggestion from her employer, Fox spun out the cotton and left her job so as to plant her first fields of naturally colored cotton. Natural Cotton Colors Inc. Fox is the founder and owner of the company Natural Cotton Colors Inc. Fox's breakthrough occurred in 1988 at Texas Tech University when she successfully produced her first species of naturally colored cotton that could be spun on a machine. After a sale with a Japanese textile mill, Fox quit her job at Sandoz Crop Protection and founded Natural Cotton Colors Inc., setting up base in Wasco, California. Fox's second major sale occurred in 1989, when she sold 122 bushels of cotton to a different Japanese mill for $279,000. Following these sales, Fox obtained Plant Variety Protection Certificates (the equivalent of patents for plants) and trademarked her cotton brand: FoxFibre. Not long after, L.L. Bean and Land's End put in significant orders for FoxFibre. Fox's business, Natural Cotton Colours, soon became a company/business worth $10 million. However, Sally Fox and FoxFibre faced many obstacles in order to produce their cotton.Southern California cotton growers, who feared the crop would contaminate their own produce, pushed for re-enforcement of early 20th-century legislation that placed strict laws on Fox's growing process and her fields. In 1993, she relocated to Arizona. But in 1999, Arizona cotton growers pushed for similar laws on Fox's fields, causing Fox to relocate once again, this time to Northern California. The company faced further barriers when, between 1990 and 1995, a majority of the spinning mills in Europe, Japan and the United States closed down, possibly in efforts to promote globalization and industrialization. = FoxFibre = FoxFibre is the patented name of Fox's various breeds of naturally colored, organically grown cotton. Different colors available for textile industries, including Redwood, Coyote, New Green, and Buffalo. Fox herself weeded, maintained, and grew cotton, each year harvesting and breeding only the best in color and in fiber. Fox even crossbred her brown cotton with traditional white cotton so as to produce crops with longer, stronger fibers for threading. Each color of cotton takes approximately ten years of cross-breeding before it can be sold on the market. Her work mirrors, and pushed for more innovation in, the scientific field of genetic engineering.  Legacy  While Fox was not the first person to invent nor harvest naturally colored cotton, she was the first to invent a species of naturally colored cotton that could be spun into thread via machine. Naturally colored cotton has short, weak fibers that traditionally required hours upon hours of expensive hand threading. White cotton has stronger, longer fibers that are able to be threaded by a machine. However, the bleaching process of the white cotton is not environmentally friendly, creating large amounts of pollution as a byproduct. Fox's cotton was a gateway for the textile industry to see how good quality clothes could be made while prioritizing the health of the environment. Furthermore, Fox grows all her cotton without pesticides or chemical pesticides, further promoting and encouraging farmers and textile industries to grow environmentally friendly products. Fox and her work has been featured in Civil Eats, Core77, the Sacramento Bee, and Popular Mechanics..

They describe the variability within plants that comes from human and natural selection over millennia. Their intrinsic value mainly concerns agricultural crops. According to the 1983 revised International Undertaking on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), plant genetic resources are defined as the entire generative and vegetative reproductive material of species with economical and/or social value, especially for the agriculture of the present and the future, with special emphasis on nutritional plants. In the State of the World’s Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (1998) the FAO defined Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (PGRFA) as the diversity of genetic material contained in traditional varieties and modern cultivars as well as crop wild relatives and other wild plant species that can be used now or in the future for food and agriculture. History The first use of plant genetic resources dates to more than 10,000 years ago, when farmers selected from the genetic variation they found in wild plants to develop their crops. As human populations moved to different climates and ecosystems, taking the crops with them, the crops adapted to the new environments, developing, for example, genetic traits providing tolerance to conditions such as drought, water logging, frost and extreme heat. These traits - and the plasticity inherent in having wide genetic variability - are important properties of plant genetic resources. In recent centuries, although humans had been prolific in collecting exotic flora from all corners of the globe to fill their gardens, it wasn’t until the early 20th century that the widespread and organized collection of plant genetic resources for agricultural use began in earnest. Russian geneticist Nikolai Vavilov, considered by some as the father of plant genetic resources, realized the value of genetic variability for breeding and collected thousands of seeds during his extensive travels to establish one of the first gene banks. Vavilov inspired the American Jack Harlan to collect seeds from across the globe for the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).Thompson, Peter. 2010.

Plant Explorer. New York: Julian Messner, 1963 It wasn’t until 1967 that the term genetic resources was coined by Otto Frankel and Erna Bennett at the historic International Conference on Crop Plant Exploration and Conservation, organized by the FAO and the International Biological Program (IBP)Frankel, O.H., and Bennett, E, (Eds.) 1970. Genetic Resources in Plants -- Their Exploration and Conservation, International Biological Programme, Handbook II. Blackwell, OxfordWilkes, G., 2007.

A modest proposal for teosinte evolution and conservation in situ: the Balsas, Guerrero, Mexico. Maydica, 52(1), 49-58. “The effective utilization of genetic resources requires that they are adequately classified and evaluated” was a key message from the conference. Conservation Plant genetic resource conservation has become increasingly important as more plants have become threatened or rare. At the same time, an exploding world population and rapid climate change have led humans to seek new resilient and nutritious crops. Plant conservation strategies generally combine elements of conservation on farm (as part of the crop production cycle, where it continues to evolve and support farmer needs), ex situ (for example in gene banks or field collections as seed or tissue samples) or in situ (where they grow in the wild or protected areas). Most in situ conservation concerns crop wild relatives, an important source of genetic variation to crop breeding programs. Plant genetic resources that are conserved by any of these methods are often referred to as germplasm, which is a shorthand term meaning \\"any genetic materials\\". The term originates from germ plasm, August Weismann's theory that heritable information is transmitted only by germ cells, and which has been superseded by modern insights on inheritance, including epigenetics and non- nuclear DNA. After the Second World War, efforts to conserve plant genetic resources came mainly from breeders’ organizations in the USA and Europe, which led to crop-specific collections primarily located in developed countries (e.g. IRRI, CIMMYT). In the 1960s and 1970s, more focus was put on the collection and conservation of plant genetic resources in face of genetic erosion by organizations such as the Rockefeller Foundation and the European Society of Breeding Research (EUCARPIA). A key event in the conservation of plant genetic resources was the establishment of the International Board for Plant Genetic Resources (IBPGR) (now Bioversity International) in 1974, whose mandate was to promote and assist in the worldwide effort to collect and conserve the plant germplasm needed for future research and production. IBPGR mobilized scientists to create a global network of gene banks, thus marking the international recognition of the importance of plant genetic resources. In 2002, the Global Crop Diversity Trust was established by Bioversity International on behalf of the CGIAR and the FAO through a Crop Diversity Endowment Fund. The goal of the Trust is to provide a secure and sustainable source of funding for the world's most important crop collections. Policy In response to the growing awareness of the global value of and threat to biological diversity, the United Nations drafted the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the first global multilateral treaty focused on the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. Article 15 of the CBD specified that countries have national sovereignty over their genetic resources, but that there should be facilitated access and benefit sharing (ABS) under mutually agreed terms and with prior informed consent. Going further to protect national sovereignty of plant genetic resources, an instrumental piece of legislation, The International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA), was adopted by the FAO in November 2001 and came into force in 2004. The ITPGRFA established several mechanisms under the Multilateral System, which grants free access and equitable use of 64 of the world’s most important crops (Annex 1 crops) for some uses (research, breeding and training for food and agriculture). The treaty prevents the recipients of genetic resources from claiming intellectual property rights over those resources in the form in which they received them, and ensures that access to genetic resources is consistent with international and national laws. This is facilitated by the Standard Material Transfer Agreement, a mandatory contract between providers and recipients for the exchange of germplasm under the Multilateral System. The Governing Body of the treaty, through FAO as the Third Party Beneficiary, has an interest in the agreements. The Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization is a supplementary agreement to the Convention on Biological Diversity that was adopted in 2010 and enforced in 2014. It provides greater legal transparency to policies governing fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources. Issues and controversies Due to the high value and complexity of plant genetic resources and the number of parties involved globally, some issues have arisen over their conservation and use. Much of the material for breeding programs was collected from the Southern hemisphere and sent to gene banks in the Northern hemisphere, a concern that led to more emphasis on the national sovereignty of plant genetic resources and instigated policies that addressed the imbalance. The increased use of _plant genetic information_ for research, for example to find genes of interest for drought tolerance, has led to controversy on whether and to what extent the genetic data (separate from the organism) are subject to the international ABS regulations described above. Forest genetic resources represent a specific case of plant genetic resources.

Located mainly on Lyme Street south of Interstate 95, the village, settled in the mid-17th century, has an architectural history dating to the early 18th century, flourishing as a shipbuilding center and home to many ship captains. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. Description and history Old Lyme was one of the early settlement areas of the Puritan Saybrook Colony in the 17th century, and was the early town center of Lyme. It separated from that community as South Lyme in 1855, and eventually renamed itself Old Lyme. The village center has since the early days been arrayed along what is now called Lyme Street, which runs parallel to the Lieutenant River shortly before its mouth at the Connecticut River. The village flourished in the 18th and 19th centuries as a shipbuilding center, and was home to the Old Lyme Art Colony in the late 19th century. The artistic legacy is continued by the presence of the Lyme Art Association and the Lyme Academy College of Fine Arts in the village. The historic district extends along Lyme Street, roughly from the junction with I-95 southward to McCurdy Street, and then a short way along that roadway. It also includes a few buildings north of I-95, including the Old Lyme Inn and the Florence Griswold House and Museum, the historic center of the art colony. The town's civic buildings are located in the village, including the town hall and library. Houses in the district range across the architectural spectrum from the early 18th century to the late 19th century, and including the Peck Tavern on Sill Lane, an 18th-century tavern that is now a private residence.

Even though the Nigerian Army forces managed to extricate themselves from the ambush, the attack seriously affected the morale of the involved soldiers who felt that their leadership was carelessly sacrificing them in the war against the insurgents. As result, elements of the Nigerian Army's 7th Division subsequently mutinied at Maiduguri and almost killed their own commander, \\"humiliat[ing] the Nigerian military\\".  Background  A Nigerian Army soldier at the destroyed school of Chibok after the kidnapping of 14 April 2014 The Salafi jihadist Boko Haram movement launched an insurgency against the Nigerian government following an unsuccessful uprising in 2009. Supported by several other Jihadist groups such as al-Qaeda, the group uses raids, assaults, and ambushes to terrorize its civilian opponents and destabilize the government with the ultimate goal of establishing an Islamic state in northern Nigeria. Boko Haram considers all \\"Western or secular ideas [...] heretical and worthy of attack\\", and thus often targets Western-influenced schools. Its most infamous attack in this regard was the abduction of 276 female students in Chibok on 14 April 2014. Due to numerous problems affecting the Nigerian Armed Forces, including rampant corruption among its leadership, the Nigerian Army has found it extremely difficult to adapt to Boko Haram's guerilla warfare and defeat the insurgency. In response to the Chibok kidnapping, the Nigerian military intensified its counter-insurgency campaign in Borno State, but enjoyed little success. Often lacking even basic necessities, such as weapons, ammunition, pay, and food, the soldiers involved in these operations became increasingly dissatisfied and demoralized over time. Believing that they were being \\"killed like rats by the insurgents\\", they felt left alone or even betrayed by their commanders.  Ambush  On early 13 May 2014, pro- government militias from three villages in the Kala/Balge area repelled a major Boko Haram raid, allegedly killing up to 200 insurgents, as well as capturing some fighters and military equipment. Upon learning of this, the Nigerian Army's 7th Division sent some of its forces from Maiduguri to Kala/Balge on a \\"special operation\\". The soldiers gathered some of the captured Boko Haram materiel from the locals, who relayed to them \\"misleading\\", \\"faulty and unverified information\\" about the possible location of the kidnapped schoolgirls from Chibok. Upon learning of this, the general officer commanding the 7th Division, Major General Ahmadu Mohammed, promptly ordered the soldiers in the field to either to return to their base at Maiduguri or to conduct a patrol to search for the abductees. By then, the 7th Division troops in question were in Chibok and protested against this order, as this would force them to move through the wilderness at night, exposing them to possible Boko Haram attacks. They pleaded with their officers to spend the night at one of the villages. The commanders in the field consequently called Major General Ahmadu Mohammed for permission to do so, but were overruled. Told that \\"the top ranks at the headquarters of the 7 Division would not be pleased if they don't go back to Maiduguri that night\\", the 7th Division forces then started to advance along the road to Maiduguri. Boko Haram had received intel about the Nigerian Army convoy, however, and prepared an ambush near Chibok. Several Boko Haram fighters hid on either side of the road, while others formed support and security units; the former were supposed to aid the attack on the Nigerian Army convoy, while the latter ensured that the ambushing fighters were not surprised by possible government reinforcements. The insurgents waited until the military convoy had entered the kill zone, whereupon they launched their assault. Several soldiers were killed or wounded until the Nigerian Army troops managed to break through. The insurgents then retreated via planned routes, while the convoy continued to travel to Maiduguri. The Nigerian military initially claimed that only four soldiers had been killed, but independent sources confirmed that 12 had been killed and numerous others wounded. One of the dead was a commanding officer, Major Olalekan Akintola. According to the government, several attackers had also been killed during the fighting.  Aftermath  Though the Nigerian soldiers had managed to overcome the ambush, the Boko Haram assault had serious repercussions for the 7th Division's morale, which had already been low. Since this insurgent attack had happened just as they had feared, the surviving troops blamed Major General Ahmadu Mohammed for carelessly ordering them to move at night and for having needlessly sacrificed their comrades. When the convoy arrived at Maiduguri, word about the events quickly spread and anger mounted among the entire 7th Division. When Ahmadu Mohammed came to Maiduguri to pay respect to the fallen soldiers and address his forces, the situation escalated. Outraged, several soldiers started to fire into the air or threw stones at the major general's car. Eventually, some of those who had survived the ambush even shot at the commander, barely missing him. Some of Ahmadu Mohammed's bodyguards were hit and wounded. The situation was later brought back under control, and 18 soldiers were arrested and court-martialed. Charged for \\"mutiny, criminal conspiracy, attempted murder, disobeying orders, insubordination and false accusation\\", all pleaded not guilty. Five were discharged from the army, one was sentenced to hard labor, and 12 were sentenced to death for trying to murder Ahmadu Mohammed and inciting mutiny. The ambush near Chibok and subsequent mutiny at Maiduguri received international attention and \\"humiliated the Nigerian military\\". The incident was judged to be \\"a big blow at a time when the nation is rallying behind the military to rescue the abducted schoolgirls\\". Major General Ahmadu Mohammed was subsequently replaced by General M. Y. Ibrahim as GOC of the 7th Division. Nevertheless, the situation for the soldiers in the campaign against Boko Haram did not markedly improve. As result, 7th Division soldiers in Maiduguri again mutinied just three months after the Chibok ambush.

A broadcast is a commonly used collective operation that sends data from one processor to all other processors. The two- tree broadcast communicates concurrently over two binary trees that span all processors. This achieves full usage of the bandwidth in the full-duplex communication model while having a startup latency logarithmic in the number of partaking processors. The algorithm can also be adapted to perform a reduction or prefix sum.  Algorithm  A broadcast sends a message from a specified root processor to all other processors. Binary tree broadcasting uses a binary tree to model the communication between the processors. Each processor corresponds to one node in the tree, and the root processor is the root of the tree. To broadcast a message , the root sends to its two children (child nodes). Each processor waits until it receives and then sends to its children. Because leaves have no children, they don't have to send any messages. The broadcasting process can be pipelined by splitting the message into blocks, which are then broadcast consecutively. In such a binary tree, the leaves of the tree only receive data, but never send any data themselves. If the communication is bidirectional (full-duplex), meaning each processor can send a message and receive a message at the same time, the leaves only use one half of the available bandwidth. Two-tree broadcast with seven processors, including the edge coloring. in red, in blue. The last processor is the root. The idea of the two-tree broadcast is to use two binary trees and and communicate on both concurrently. The trees are constructed so that the interior nodes of one tree correspond to leaf nodes of the other tree. The data that has to be broadcast is split into blocks of equal size. In each step of the algorithm, each processor receives one block and sends the previous block to one of its children in the tree in which it is an interior node. A schedule is needed so that no processor has to send or receive two messages in the same step. To create such a schedule, the edges of both trees are colored with 0 and 1 such that * no processor is connected to its parent nodes in and using edges of the same color * no processor is connected to its children nodes in or using edges of the same color. Edges with color 0 are used in even steps, edges with color 1 are used in odd steps. This schedule allows each processor to send one message and receive one message in each step, fully utilizing the available bandwidth. Assume that processor wants to broadcast a message. The two trees are constructed for the remaining processors. Processor sends blocks alternating to the roots of the two trees, so each tree broadcasts one half of the message.  Analysis  Let be the number of processing elements (PE), numbered from to . = Construction of the trees = Two-trees of size 6, 12, 7, 9 using mirroring (top) and shifting (bottom). in red, in blue. Let . and can be constructed as trees of height , such that both trees form an in-order numbering of the processors, with the following method: : If , is a complete binary tree of height except that the rightmost leaf is missing. Otherwise, consists of a complete binary tree of height covering PEs , a recursively constructed tree covering PEs , and a root at PE whose children are the roots of the left and the right subtree. : There are two ways to construct . With shifting, is first constructed like , except that it contains an additional processor. Then is shifted by one position to the left and the leftmost leaf is removed. With mirroring, is the mirror image of (with the mirror axis between processors and ). Mirroring only works for even . It can be proven that a coloring with the desired properties exists for all . When mirroring is used to construct , each processor can independently compute the color of its incident edges in time. = Communication Time = For this analysis, the following communication model is used: A message of size has a communication time of , independent on which processors communicate. represents the startup overhead to send the message, represents the transmission time per data element. Suppose the message of size is split into blocks. Each communication step takes time . Let be the height of the communication structure with the root at processor and the two trees below it. After steps, the first data block has reached every node in both trees. Afterwards, each processor receives one block in every step until it received all blocks. The total number of steps is resulting in a total communication time of . Using an optimal , the total communication time is .  Comparison to similar algorithms  In a linear pipeline broadcast, the message is split into blocks. In each step, each processor receives one block from the processor and sends one block to the processor . Linear pipeline has optimal throughput, but has a startup time in . For large , the startup latency of the two-tree broadcast is faster. Because both algorithms have optimal throughput, the two-tree algorithm is faster for a large numbers of processors. A binomial tree broadcast communicates along a binomial tree. Each process receives the message that is broadcast (the root already has the message) and then sends the message to its children. A binomial tree broadcast has only half the startup time of the two-tree broadcast, but a factor of more communication. The binomial tree broadcast is faster than the two-tree broadcast for small messages, but slower for large messages. Fibonacci trees of height one to five A pipelined binary tree broadcast splits the message into blocks and broadcasts the blocks consecutively over a binary tree. By using a Fibonacci tree instead of a simple balanced binary tree, the startup latency can be reduced to . A Fibonacci tree of height consists of a root that has a Fibonacci tree of height as its left child and a Fibonacci tree of as its right child. The pipelined Fibonacci tree broadcast has half the startup latency of the two-tree broadcast, but also only half of the throughput. It is faster for small messages, while the two-tree broadcast is faster for large messages.  Usage for other communication primitives  = Reduction = Two-tree reduction with seven processors. The last processor is the root. in red, in blue. A reduction (\`MPI_Reduce\` in the MPI standard) computes \\\\bigoplus_{i=0}^{p-1} M_i where is a vector of length originally available at processor and \\\\bigoplus is a binary operation that is associative, but not necessarily commutative. The result is stored at a specified root processor . Assume that or . In this case the communication is identical to the broadcast, except that the communication direction is reversed. Each process receives two blocks from its children, reduces them with its own block, and sends the result to its parent. The root takes turns receiving blocks from the roots of and and reduces them with its own data. The communication time is the same as for the Broadcast and the amount of data reduced per processor is . If the reduce operation is commutative, the result can be achieved for any root by renumbering the processors. Two-tree reduction with 13 processors. The sixth processor (dark grey) is the root. s in red, s in blue. If the operation is not commutative and the root is not or , then is a lower bound for the communication time. In this case, the remaining processors are split into two subgroups. The processors perform a reduction to the root and the processors perform a reduction to the root . Processor receives blocks alternating from the two roots of the subgroups. = Prefix sum = A prefix sum (\`MPI_Scan\`) computes \\\\bigoplus_{i=0}^{j} M_i for each processor where is a vector of length originally available at processor and \\\\bigoplus is a binary associative operation. Using an inorder binary tree, a prefix sum can be computed by first performing an up-phase in which each interior node computes a partial sum \\\\bigoplus_{i=l}^{r} M_i for left- and rightmost leaves and , followed by a down-phase in which prefixes of the form \\\\bigoplus_{i=0}^{l-1} M_i are sent down the tree and allow each processor to finish computing its prefix sum. The communication in the up-phase is equivalent to a reduction to processor and the communication in the down-phase is equivalent to a broadcast from the processor . The total communication time is about twice the communication time of the two-tree broadcast.  ESBT broadcast  If is a power of two, there is an optimal broadcasting algorithm based on edge disjoint spanning binomial trees (ESBT) in a hypercube. The hypercube, excluding the root , is split into ESBTs. The algorithm uses pipelining by splitting the broadcast data into blocks. Processor cyclically distributes blocks to the roots of the ESBTs and each ESBT performs a pipelined binary tree broadcast. In step , each processor sends and receives one message along dimension . The communication time of the algorithm is , so the startup latency is only one half of the startup latency of the two-tree broadcast. The drawback of the ESBT broadcast is that it does not work for other values of and it cannot be adapted for (non-commutative) reduction or prefix sum.

A capable and brave soldier, Ibn al-Sallar assumed senior gubernatorial positions, culminating in the governorship of Alexandria. From this position in 1149 he launched a revolt, along with his stepson Abbas ibn Abi al-Futuh. Defeating the army of the then vizier, Ibn Masal, he occupied Cairo and forced the young Caliph al-Zafir to appoint him vizier instead. A mutual disdain and hatred bound the two men thereafter, and the Caliph even conspired to have Ibn al- Sallar assassinated. During this tenure, Ibn al-Sallar restored order in the army and strove to halt Crusader attacks on Egypt, but with limited success. He was assassinated at the behest of his ambitious stepson Abbas, who succeeded him as vizier. Early life Of Kurdish origin, Ibn al-Sallar grew up in Jerusalem, where his father was in the service of the local Artuqid governors. Al-Adil became a follower of the Shafi'i school of Sunni Islam. Following the brief Fatimid recovery of Jerusalem in 1098, Ibn al-Sallar's father was kept in his position, and Ibn al-Sallar himself received his first official post, as commander of the elite mounted battalion (ṣubyān al-ḥajar) belonging to the Fatimid army. Ibn al-Sallar distinguished himself in battle against the Crusaders, beginning a career that led him to the governorships of Upper Egypt, al-Buhayra, and Alexandria. In the latter post, he met Bullara, the widow of a Zirid prince who had died in exile in the city. To further his political ambitions, he soon married Bullara, and raised her son Abbas ibn Abi al-Futuh as his own. Vizierate Political map of the Levant in At the time of the death of Caliph al-Hafiz in October 1149, Ibn al-Sallar was governor of Alexandria, and his stepson Abbas was governor of the neighbouring district of al-Gharbiyya. Ibn al-Sallar had hoped to be named vizier by the new ruler al- Zafir, but the latter chose Ibn Masal instead. Infuriated, Ibn al-Sallar refused to accept the appointment, and together with Abbas conspired against Ibn Masal. When al-Zafir learned of this plot, he called upon assistance from the grandees of the realm in support of Ibn Masal, but they proved unwilling to. In the end, the Caliph provided Ibn Masal with his own funds to hire mercenaries for action against Ibn al-Sallar. Ibn al-Sallar entered Cairo on 10 December, and installed himself in the vizier's palace. For the moment al- Zafir was forced to submit to the new strongman, appointing him vizier and conferring him the honorific titles al-Malik al-ʿĀdil (\\"righteous ruler\\"), al- Sayyid al-ʿAjal (\\"most noble master\\"), Amīr al-Juyūsh (\\"commander of the armies\\"), Sharaf al-Islām (\\"glory of Islam\\"), Kafī Quḍāt al-Muslimīn (\\"protector of the Muslims' qāḍīs\\"), and Hādī Duʿāt al-Muʾminīn (\\"guide of the believers' missionaries\\"). His position was not yet secure, as Ibn Masal was among the tribes of Upper Egypt, trying to raise additional troops. Furthermore, the Caliph was unreconciled to the new situation, and conspired to have Ibn al-Sallar killed. In retaliation, in January 1150 Ibn al-Sallar gathered the caliphal guard (ṣibyān al-khāṣṣ), an elite corps of cadets comprising the sons of high dignitaries and officials, and executed most of them, sending the rest to serve on the empire's frontiers. He then sent an army under his stepson Abbas, along with Tala'i ibn Ruzzik, to confront Ibn Masal and his ally, Badr ibn Rafi. The two armies met in battle at Dalas in the province of Bahnasa on 19 February 1150, in which Ibn Masal was defeated and killed. Abbas brought his severed head back to Cairo as a token of victory. Unsurprisingly, the relationship between caliph and vizier remained extremely hostile: according to Usama ibn Munqidh, the two despised each other, with the Caliph conspiring to kill Ibn al-Sallar, and the latter seeking to depose the Caliph. The mutual hatred of both men was only kept in check by the grave external threats faced by the empire from the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem. Ibn al-Sallar entertained the notion of an alliance and joint action with the Zengid ruler of Aleppo, Nur al-Din, but this did not come to pass, as the latter was focused on capturing Damascus at the time. Nevertheless, following the sack of Farama by the Crusaders, in 1151/2 Ibn al- Sallar mobilized the Fatimid navy to raid Christian shipping along the coasts of the Levant from Jaffa to Tripoli, Lebanon. The fleet inflicted significant casualties and returned victorious. This success strengthened Ibn al-Sallar's position domestically, but was hollow, as neither the Fatimids nor Nur al-Din followed it up; in contrast, in early 1153 the Crusaders launched an attack on the Fatimid outpost of Ascalon. The garrison of Ascalon comprised men of the local tribe of Kinaniyya, and a 400–600 strong cavalry force sent from Cairo every six months. In March 1153, Ibn al-Sallar prepared to send reinforcements to the city, both naval and military. While the fleet was being prepared under the personal supervision of Ibn al-Sallar, the army left Cairo for Bilbays. The force was led by his stepson Abbas and Usama ibn Mandiqh. According to the historian al-Maqrizi, this mission displeased Abbas, who would much rather have continued to spend his time savouring the pleasures of Cairo. His ambition inflamed by Usama, who suggested that he could become sultan of Egypt if only he so desired, Abbas decided to kill his stepfather. The plot was hatched with the agreement of the Caliph. Abbas sent his son Nasr, a favourite of the Caliph, back to in Cairo to stay with his grandmother in the palace of Ibn al-Sallar, ostensibly to spare him from the dangers of war. During the night Nasr entered the chamber of Ibn al-Sallar and murdered him in his sleep. He then sent a message by carrier pigeon to his father, who quickly returned to Cairo to claim the vizierate for himself, showing Ibn al-Sallar's severed head to the populace assembled before the Bab al-Dhahab gate. Abandoned to its fate, Ascalon fell to the Crusaders in August 1153. Neither Abbas nor al-Zafir survived for long. Al-Zafir was killed by Nasr in April 1154 and replaced by his five-year old son, al-Fa'iz bi-Nasr Allah. When Abbas executed two of al- Zafir's brothers, the remaining Fatimid princes appealed to Tala'i ibn Ruzzik for aid. Abbas and Nasr were forced to flee to Syria, where Abbas was killed, while Nasr was captured by the Crusaders and handed back to the Fatimids for execution. Legacy Historian Thierry Bianquis assesses Ibn al-Sallar as \\"a man of no discernible qualities whatsoever\\", whose greed led to \\"brutal and vindictive crimes\\", described in some detail by the chroniclers Ibn Zafir and Ibn Muyassar. These had made him widely unpopular, so that his murder was welcomed at the time. As vizier, Ibn al-Sallar raised the pay of the army, restoring its order and discipline, and reactivated the Fatimid fleet, for the first time since 1125; unlike the army, the fleet showed itself to be an effective force during this period. Ibn al-Sallar was also active in promoting Sunni Islam in Egypt, against the Isma'ili doctrine espoused by the Fatimids: he ordered the construction of a Shafi'i madrasa in Alexandria, known as al- Adiliyya and completed in 1151/2, and may have been responsible for the appointment of the Shafi'i Abu'l-Ma'ali ibn Jumay al-Arsufi as chief qāḍī of Egypt. He was also responsible for commissioning a number of other buildings, including several mosques and madrasas. His rise to power and downfall mark the beginning of the end for the Fatimid state: from al-Zafir on the caliphs were underage youths, sidelined and mere puppets at the hands of the strongmen who vied for the vizierate. This power struggle between generals and viziers dominated the last decades of the Fatimid state, until its takeover by Saladin in 1171.

Developed by Filipino technology companies TrackMate Business Solutions and PHAR Philippines, the system was initially unveiled on May 5, 2017. History PARDS was created amid complaints from train passengers that they are unaware of what's going on while riding the system, with a lack of information displays among one of their major complaints. The system was unveiled on May 5, 2017, with the system being installed on one Line 2 train. By June 2017, all ten active train units were fitted with the system, with some 400 LCD monitors installed system-wide. Installed at no cost to the national government, PARDS is funded through advertising. Although initially deployed on the Line 2, TrackMate also presented the system to the Light Rail Manila Corporation, the operator of Line 1, and to the Metro Rail Transit Corporation, operator of Line 3, eliciting a positive reaction. TrackMate also claimed that there is interest in deploying PARDS internationally, as well as that there is potential in deploying it as a suitable low-cost alternative to traditional railway signalling systems. On March 28, 2019, an event was held announcing the system's rebranding to TUBE. In contrast to PARDS, TUBE features a redesigned interface and advertisements, and during the event, Filipino Youtube personalities presented how the companies aimed to deploy the system to all three lines. PHAR and TrackMate have announced that Line 3 trains will be equipped with the system by April 2019, with the goal of having the system deployed on all three lines by July. Technology TUBE uses GPS technology to determine a train's speed, location and other important information, which helps determine a train's arrival and departure time. Information from the train is uploaded to the cloud, which is then transmitted back to the train. Each TUBE-equipped train has been fitted with at least 40 LCD monitors which not only shows the train's location, but also news, public service announcements, passenger traffic and entertainment. The system is also capable of transmitting real-time information when circumstances require, such as in an emergency. TUBE also has a mobile component, where real-time train information can be accessed through a mobile application to be developed as part of the project's second phase, as well as a backend which allows the Light Rail Transit Authority to monitor train performance and passenger loads in real time.

Plot In the summer of 2014, Sophie Kessler, a waitress and single mother, who lives with her diabetic mother Kristin and her son Garret in Iowa, discovers that her son is vomiting in his sleep. Fearing that he had developed a new kind of flu, she rushes him to the doctor who reassures her. Garret then develops a rash that neither a pediatrician, dermatologist, or psychologist can diagnose. Sophie theorizes that Garret might have a disease linked to genetically modified organisms. Sophie then goes to a science lab at the university where her mother works as a secretary and meets Indian scientist, Serge Negani. She then meets Peter Landell, who overhears Sophie talking to Serge about her worries for her son, claiming to be a university scientist, claims about files containing the answers to her questions. Sophie leaves Garret with Eddie, a man she met at Garret's school and sneaks into the university with Peter to find the files, using her mother's keys. After discovering that the files are missing, security guards find them and reveal that Peter is really a janitor. Serge, who has been researching biotech chickens and GMO reactions on rats with fellow scientist Jacob, discovers the chickens to be dead and looks through Jacob's computer for any information. He finds information, exposing the dangers of the project, prints it, puts it into a box, and into the trunk of his car. He calls Sophie to tell her, but she is stressed after finding out that Eddie works as a cop for the GMO corporation, Clonestra. She refuses to speak with him and hangs up on him. Serge gets into his car and begins to drive to Sophie‘s house to show her the information. Serge is then pursued by two drunk men who cause him to have a car accident, killing him upon impact. After hearing of the accident on the news, Sophie goes to see Serge's widow, who tells her that Serge's grandfather was a farmer in India who was growing GMO corn, with seeds given by Clonestra, which eventually became less productive and expensive and that his grandfather and some other farmers drank pesticide in protest. Sophie then goes to a scrap-metal yard, where Serge's car was taken to once it was destroyed, and retrieves the information and takes it to Clonestra with Eddie's help, leading the CEO, Dan Conoway, to resign, after Kristin posts a YouTube video of Sophie exposing the dangers of GMOs. Some time later, Sophie, Garret, Kritsin, Eddie, and Eddie's son are at a football game. Sophie then realizes that GMOs have still not been labeled and begins to experience anxiety with her heart pounding rapidly.

The station is served by regional trains between Palaiofarsalos and Kalambaka. History The station was opened on 16 June 1886, by the Thessalian Railways Company. Trikala was one of main line stations (as shown by the impressive original station building) along with Farsala and Kalambaka. Freight traffic declined sharply when the state-imposed monopoly of OSE for the transport of agricultural products and fertilisers ended in the early 1990s. Many small stations of the network with little passenger traffic were closed down, especially on the mainline section and between Karditsa and Kalampaka. In 2001 the section between Kalampaka and Palaiofarsalos was converted from 600 mm gauge to standard gauge and physically connected at Palaiofarsalos with the mainline from Athens to Thessaloniki.https://www.ergose.gr/project/anavathmisi_grammis_palaiofarsalos_kalambaka/?lang=en Since to upgrade, however, travel times improved and the unification of rail gauge allowed direct services, even InterCity services, to link Volos and Kalambaka with Athens and Thessaloniki. Today the small Trikala Museum Showroom, located in a square opposite the Station showcases a small steam engine and two auxiliary wagons of the old Thessaly Network.http://www.ose.gr/en/culture/museum-stands/165-museum-showroom-in- trikala Facilities The station has a footbridge from platform 1 to platform 2, via stairs or lift. Services Today, the station is served by direct lines to the rest of Greece, via Palaiofarsalos, served both by intercity trains to Athens, Larissa and Thessaloniki and Proastiakos to Athens.https://tickets.trainose.gr/dromologia/?lang=en#view=search;apo=%CE%9A%CE%91%CE%A1%CE%94;pros=%CE%A4%CE%A1%CE%99%CE%9A;date=2018-11-23;trip_type=single;return_date=undefined- undefined- Previously Thessaly Railways operated a narrow gauge service to Volos.

Building and civilian service  The vessel was laid down on 30 June 1938 by the Osaka Iron Works at its shipyard for Nissan Kisen K.K.. Launched on 6 November of that year and named Nissan Maru, she was completed and registered at Tokyo on 15 January 1939. Nissan Maru was a 6,534 GRT cargo ship with a net tonnage of 3,887. She was equipped with a direction finder, and had two decks with a cruiser stern. She had a length of 424.1 feet, a beam of 57.4 feet, and a depth of 34.4 feet. The ship was powered by two oil-burning Hitachi steam turbines double reduction geared to one screw shaft rated at 500 NHP.Lloyd's Register (1940–1941), Steamers and Motorships, Seq. 80302 On 19 July 1939, while steaming down the Whangpoo River at Shanghai, she suffered a twisted bow after colliding with the SS President Coolidge while the latter was tied up at a pier. No injuries occurred on either ship.  Military service  On 9 September 1941, as Japan prepared to enter World War II, Nissan Maru was requisitioned by the Imperial Japanese Navy. She became an auxiliary collier and oiler attached to the Maizuru Naval District, homeported at Maizuru on 20 September. On the same day the auxiliary was assigned to the 5th Fleet, and Captain Sakuma Takao was appointed its supervisor. The vessel began conversion to military service on 24 September at the Osaka Iron Works shipyard; the conversion was finished on 15 October. On 25 November Sakuma was relieved by Captain Naotsuka Hachiro, and on the next day she departed Yokosuka. Nissan Maru spent the next months on duty around Hokkaido and the Kuriles, before arriving at Chichijima on 23 January 1942. On 28 January she returned to Yokosuka, before being assigned to supply the Aleutian Islands Campaign invasion force on 1 February. On 7 March she was assigned to transport ammunition by the 5th Fleet, with an additional personnel transport mission being added on 17 March. In April she was fitted with fourteen Daihatsu-class landing craft, as well as a rangefinder and related equipment in May. On 5 May Nissan Maru was assigned to the operation for the seizure of Attu and Kiska; Naotsuka was relieved by Captain Ishii Saburo on 15 May. She arrived at Mutsu Bay in preparation for the invasion on 22 May, but was transferred to Kawauchi Bay on 26 May. She was briefly diverted to the Kuriles, and unloaded 200 tons of coal at Attu on 10 June. Nissan Maru arrived at Kiska on 12 June and unloaded her cargo.

His work, mostly documentary photography, focuses primarily on the lives of little known groups in America and abroad.  Life and work  Salzmann was born January 4, 1944, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He describes himself as being \\"of that generation which thought that photography could bring about socially beneficial change.\\" Educated in Philadelphia schools, he acquired photographic skills along the way, often from older photographers. Much of his career has involved using photography to preserve the history of groups of people in danger of being ignored and forgotten and encouraging his subjects to retrieve memories and tell their stories. Edward Sozanski, the late Philadelphia Inquirer art critic, wrote of Salzmann's work, \\"Cross a visual anthropologist with a talented photographer and you get Laurence Salzmann\\" and goes on to say that Salzmann's deep immersions in local cultures are \\"what give his photographs exceptional resonance and poignancy.\\" (Phila. Inquirer, 2008) Salzmann's first documentary project, \\"Family of Luis\\" (1965), came out of his assignment as a Peace Corps trainee in a barrio humilde of Ciudad Juarez. It attracted the notice of the Photography Curator at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Kneeland McNaulty, who bought several prints for their Museum Collection. The \\"Family of Luis\\" essay led to Salzmann's being hired as a participant observer and photographer by St. Luke's Hospital Department of Community Psychiatry for a joint project with Columbia University. Again, he lived among his subjects, this time in a Single Room Occupancy hotel, on New York's upper West Side. documenting the lives of its residents. His work, Neighbors on the Block, was published by the New York State Council on the Arts. A grant from the American Film Institute for documentary film making enabled him and filmmaker Peter Barton to complete two films about residents of the hotels. Salzmann took courses in Sociology at the New School of Social Research and earned a Master of Arts in Visual Anthropology from Temple University (1971). This training, in addition to his photographic experience, led to work with Tim Asch as editor for several of the films (Children's Magical Death, New Tribes Mission, Tug of War, Weeding the Garden) in Asch's Yamomoto film series (1971) and as an editor on Alan Lomax's Choreometrics project. A Fulbright grant enabled Salzmann to spend 1974 – 1976 in the small Romanian town of Radauti, documenting the lives of the remaining members of its Jewish community who had survived the Holocaust. Again, Salzmann learned the language of his subjects and lived among them. His pictures were published in the book: The Last Jews of Radauti with text by Ayşe Gürsan-Salzmann, (Doubleday, 1983). His film, Song of Radauti was broadcast nationwide by PBS. At the invitation of Cornell Capa, Director of the International Center of Photography, a large selection of the Radauti pictures was shown at the International Center of Photography. A grant from International Research & Exchanges Board allowed Salzmann to live for a year documenting the lives of Transhumant (migratory) shepherds in the Transylvania region of Romania. That work was published in book form under the title of Miortiza and shown in the Bucuresti Peasant Museum.http://www.muzeultaranuluiroman.ro/home.html At the invitation of the 500 Years Foundation Salzmann was invited to Turkey to produce a photographic essay on the Jews of that country. That project with a film took 5 years to complete and culminated in an exhibit, Anyos Munchos I Buenos that was shown in museums in Israel, the Netherlands, Germany, France, and the United States, plus two books, and a documentary film. Most recently, Salzmann has worked in Cuba, Mexico, and Peru, documenting the lives and work of artists and athletes in Cuba, the way of life left behind by Mexican migrants to Philadelphia. A second Fulbright Grant to Peru has provided funding for Salzmann to document ways in which pre-Hispanic culture continue on the lives and culture of Quechua speaking communities of Cusco's Sacred Valley Writing of Salzmann's La Lucha/The Struggle, a study of young athletes training in Castro's Cuba, Miles Orvell wrote “ Salzmann's photographs constitute an aesthetic and social document of great power...and are a tribute to his generous vision of cross- cultural understanding.” (The Photo Review, Vol. 28, No.3, pp 22–23, 2009) Summing up Salzmann's work, Jason Francisco, Associate Professor of Film and Media Studies at Emory College, has written “”The core intelligence of Salzmann's [work] is his non-didacticism, his unwillingness to forsake the suggestive for the merely explanatory ...”  Publications  * 2017 Misk’I Kachi // Sweet Salt // Sal Dulce, Blue Flower Press, Philadelphia. * 2012 EcheleGanas/ Do Your Best, Blue Flower Press, Philadelphia * 2010 in Search of Turkey's Jews, Libra Press, Istanbul. * 2006 La Lucha/The Struggle, Blue Flower Press, Philadelphia. * 2005 De Noche//By Night, Artist's Book, Philadelphia. * 2002 Imagining Cutumba, Lafayette College, Easton, PA. * 1999 Miorita: An Icon of Romanian Culture, (ed.) with an introduction by Ernest H.

She considered herself to be a permanent revolutionary and lived in various countries including South Africa, Switzerland, the United States and Cuba protesting regimes which discriminated against or exploited people. Early life Merija Surduts was born on 17 March 1937 in Riga, Latvia into a Jewish communist family. Her father was a physicist and had left for Paris in 1936 after being arrested for his political activities, before her birth. Her mother was a psychologist, originally from Ponevezh, Lithuania, and immigrated in 1938 when Surduts was an infant with her mother and child. During the German occupation of Paris, the family fled to Nice and then lived in a town, Valdeblore on the border with Italy. When the Gestapo came to the border towns, they fled again to Montseveroux, but patrols in the area forced Surduts' parents to send her to live with a Catholic family. Between 1945 and 1946, Surduts was placed in a children's home run by the Entraide française (French Mutual Aid) in Bourgoin. She was later transferred to another Entraide home in Saint-Étienne and was finally reunited with her family in Paris. During this period, she only occasionally was able to attend school, but in addition to the Russian spoken in her home, she learned French and German. In 1948, Surduts and her mother traveled on Nansen passports to South Africa to visit her maternal grandfather. They had planned to visit for six months, but stayed two years. Surduts enrolled in high school in Cape Town and she and her mother lived in a Jewish commune in Seapoint, where her mother became very active in the movement against Apartheid. Returning to France in 1950, the family lived in Arcueil and Surduts enrolled in the Lycée de Montgeron, but finished her high schooling at the Lycée Marie Curie, because her parents had moved to Bourg-la- Reine. During her high school years, the family's French citizenship was finally approved. She enrolled in the National Institute of Oriental Languages and Civilizations and became involved in the National Liberation Front to free Algeria from the colonial system. When she, and then her parents, were questioned about her political activities by the Direction Régionale de Police Judiciaire de Paris, Surduts fled to Geneva in 1960. Finishing school in Switzerland as an interpreter of English and Russian, in 1962, she received a scholarship to study in the United States and settled in Chicago. Participating in many events of the American civil rights movement, she attended the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963 and then left for Cuba by way of Mexico. Career Arriving in Cuba, Surduts was referred to the Ministry of Foreign Trade and was employed as a French translator, while she studied Spanish. At the time, there was a thriving cultural and literary community of foreign nationals in Cuba, and Surduts became prominent in that circle. For eight years, she worked translating and teaching French for the Trade Ministry and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, simultaneously engaging in various activist enterprises to reduce the reliance of Cuba on foreign aid from the USSR. She performed voluntary work in the cane fields, and planted citrus trees and coffee, joining the militia units. When it became evident that the economic policies of the government were not working, those who had criticized the regime were arrested. Surduts was held for three months and then deported in 1971, returning to France. Surduts tried working as a freelance translator, but having been out of the country for so long, she had no network. She joined the radical left party, Revolution!, which would later become the Revolutionary Communist League. Activists working with factory workers referred her to the :fr:Mouvement pour la liberté de l'avortement et de la contraception MLAC, where she got involved in reproductive rights. Participating in demonstrations and circulating petitions, she fought for the passage of the Veil Law in 1975. After the right to abortion was assured with the law becoming permanent in 1979, she turned her sights to reform on the laws concerning rape and incest and then in the 1980s, began pressing for changes in employment laws, to address pay inequality, job insecurity and women being forced into part-time work. In 1990, Surduts founded and became president of the Coordination of Associations for the Right to Abortion and Contraception () in response to repeated attacks on abortion clinics and attempts to prevent women from obtaining the legal procedures in hospitals. CADAC pressed for and obtained passage of legislation in January 1993, of a law which made impeding the right to abortion a crime. In 1995, fearing that conservatives might gain in the presidential election and protections might be rolled back, CADAC organized a demonstration to rally support for women's right to equal pay, reproductive control and equality. Forty thousand protesters gathered and sparked a movement to stop roll backs in health and retirement benefits. After the rally, the National Collective for the Rights of Women, was formed and Surduts, one of the founders, became spokeswoman for the umbrella organization. From the turn of the decade, Surduts continued to work to maintain women's right to reproductive decisions, but pressed for approval of laws to guarantee minors the right to contraception and abortion, which passed in 2001; legislation to protect women from domestic violence, which passed in 2010; protested proposed closings of public hospitals in 2013; and worked on reforms of the laws on prostitution, which were being considered by the legislature at the time of her death.

His performances have been featured on Grammy, Latin Grammy and Tony award- winning projects (Dear Evan Hansen), as well as the Golden Globe winning film The Greatest Showman. He is a frequent contributor to projects by composers Pasek and Paul and Jason Robert Brown, including the latter’s Broadway musical The Bridges of Madison County. Goldner has been recognized for his mandolin performances with Sting at Carnegie Hall and live on NBC’s Christmas at Rockefeller Center, as well as his live performance with Ben Platt on the 60th Annual Grammy Awards telecast from Madison Square Garden. He also appears in Platt's Live from Radio City Music Hall concert special on Netflix. As a music producer and songwriter, Goldner is known for drawing upon both acoustic and electronic textures. Since 2009, his work as producer and bandleader of Grace McLean & Them Apples has yielded two albums, combining McLean’s vocal looping techniques with organic instruments. Consecutive performances at Lincoln Center’s American Songbook Series in 2015 and 2016 garnered recognition in the New York Times, in which Stephen Holden wrote: “In the tradition of Bobby McFerrin, [Grace McLean] is also a sonic wizard who multiplies her voice in electronic loops that can turn a singer into a one-person chorus and rhythm section. […] The electronics wove in and out of polyrhythmic jazz and swing arrangements conceived mostly by Justin Goldner, her musical director and bassist.” Other notable production and songwriting releases have included folk-pop trio Saint Adeline's eponymous debut album, Cinco Paul & Ken Daurio's Bubble Boy, and \\"Destiny\\", included on Hasbro's Jem & The Holograms tribute album. Goldner performing with Childish Gambino at Bowery Ballroom in New York Goldner participated in numerous workshops developing the music for Pasek and Paul’s film The Greatest Showman, as well as their musical Dear Evan Hansen, which he ultimately performed on Broadway. He has been featured in other performances with Ricky Martin, Macy Gray, Donald Glover, Ledisi, Jordin Sparks, Ludwig Goransson, Matisyahu, Amanda Brown, Steve Martin, John Turturro, Allison Williams, Jane Monheit, Jesse McCartney, Emily Kinney, Audra McDonald, Jeremy Jordan, Cynthia Erivo, Lolo, Grace Weber, Elle Varner, and his mentor, Meshell Ndegeocello.. Goldner co-orchestrated the musical Deathless with composer Zack Zadek, which was presented at Goodspeed Musicals in 2017. He has also performed classically with the Chelsea Symphony and Teatro Graticello, and performed live electronics and sound design with new acoustic crossover group 9 Horses. Goldner is known as well for collaborations with Latin artists, including Latin Grammy-winning Venezuelan vocalist/trumpeter Linda Briceño and Cuban rock band Del Exilio.

This small house, built with modest materials, has endured the wrath of three major hurricanes and several tropical storms and has merged with the landscape while maintaining a distinctive presence within it. Since its construction it has become a landmark and point of reference for locals. It is also considered an architectural landmark for its modern interpretation of a minimal tropical dwelling in modest traditional Puerto Rican construction materials and methods: reinforced concrete and wood. The house has been preserved by its owners in its original state. In 2006 it received the American Institute of Architects (AIA) Test of Time Award (Puerto Rico Chapter) for withstanding the test of time for more than twenty-five years since its construction. In 2014 it was included in the architectural guidebook: La Vereda Tropical: Down Where the Trade Winds Blow, published by Benjamin Vargas FAIA, as a record of all of the buildings that have been considered for the Test of Time Award by the AIA Puerto Rico Chapter from 1990 to 2009. Concept and Structure The residence was accommodated along a visual axis that stars at the lot's entrance, stretches to its tip, and connects with one of the ends of a small bay shaped by the beach. Two volumes in concrete, laid out symmetrically in relation to a diagonal axis, contain the bedrooms and the kitchen. The central space, including a living room and a family room covered with a wooden sloping roof aligned with the main view, follows the direction underlined by the organizing axis. The design included built-in furniture that maximizes the enjoyment of views towards the ocean. The whole structure was raised on columns to avoid disturbing the natural rocky topography. Some of the columns were elevated to form several porticos that frame different views of the sea and the beach. The total design effect is the creation with simple materials of a structure that does not pretend to blend with the landscape. Instead, it should be perceived as a constructed object posed on the landscape, with subtle references, in its architectural expression, to a ship.
