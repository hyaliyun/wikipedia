It takes the name from the settlement of Dunvegan, Alberta, and was first described in an outcrop on Peace River near Dunvegan by George Mercer Dawson in 1881.Dawson, G.M., 1881. Report on the exploration from Port Simpson on the Pacific Coast to Edmonton on the Saskatchewan River, Embracing a portion of the northern part of British Columbia and the Peace River Country, with Maps 150 and 152; Geological Survey of Canada, Report of Progress 1879-1880, Part B, p. 1-77.  Lithology  The Dunvegan Formation is composed of marine, and deltaic sandstone with thin shale interbeds in the Peace River Country. East of Dunvegan, Alberta it is of marine origin, and in its western reaches in British Columbia it was deposited in a continental facies, where the sandstone becomes more conglomeratic. During Dunvegan time, a brackish water environment was present in the Wapiti River area and south of Grande Prairie, where the formation is porous.  Hydrocarbon production  The Dunvegan Formation had an initial established recoverable oil reserve of 9.9 million m¬≥, with 3.1 million m¬≥ already produced as of 2008. Gas reserves totaled 18.7 million m¬≥, with 4.5 million m¬≥ already produced.  Distribution  The Dunvegan Formation is thick in its type locality in Peace River Country and up to in the sub-surface of the Canadian Rockies foothills. It occurs south of Fort Nelson and the Liard River in north-east British Columbia, thins out south of the Peace River Country. South of the Athabasca River, the Dunvegan grades laterally into the Blackstone Formation. The Dunvegan Formation is exposed in outcrop along and near the Peace River east of the foothills, in the Peace River Country and the Chinchaga area, as well as patches in north-western Alberta and south of the Caribou Mountains.  Relationship to other units  The Dunvegan Formation is conformably overlain by marine shales of the Kaskapau Formation in the Peace River Country and overlies conformably and transitionally the shale of the Fort St. John Group. The relationship between the Dunvegan and the overlying/underlying units is diachronous and the boundaries of the Dunvegan are placed at the first and last appearances of sandstone within the shale- dominated succession.

Guennoun also served as a member of a number of linguistic, educational, and Islamic academies and organizations in places such as Rabat, Cairo, Damascus, Baghdad, and Amman.  Early Life  Abdallah Guennoun was born in Fes in 1908 to a family of noble Idrissid lineage long associated with knowledge. His family moved from Fes to Tangier in 1914. He had a traditional Islamic education, memorizing the Quran and some Hadith. With access to international books in Tangier, he also taught himself Spanish and French. Career Guennoun began his writing career early; he published in the newspaper Idhar al-Haqq () in 1927 when he was 20 years old. He also wrote for publications such as the Egyptian literary magazine Arrissalah. He became active and influential in the flourishing intellectual and cultural scene in Tetuan, and he published many of his works there. As part of this intellectual circle in Tetuan, he was involved in the first nationalist publication in Morocco, as-Salaam, which published its first issue October 1933. Abdallah Guennoun was well-connected, associated with Said Hajji in the French area, Mohammed Daoud in the Spanish area, and Shakib Arslan in the Mashriq. Guennoun became involved with the Moroccan Action Committee in 1934. He opened the first of the Moroccan free schools in Tangier, the Free Abdallah Guennoun School (), and worked as a teacher in 1936. He was the editor in- chief of a monthly Islamic publication called Lisaan ad-Din () in the 1940s and published a number of articles. He also served as the general secretary of al-Mithaq, a journal put out by the faculty of al-Qarawiyyin University. He refused the support Mohammed Ben Aarafa, the puppet monarch chosen by France to replace Muhammad V, whom France had exiled. Guennoun was, among other members of the Mococcan Nationalist Movement () including Allal al-Fassi, Abdelkhalek Torres, Abdallah Ibrahim, a member of a generation of Moroccan intellectuals brought together the political and the cultural, and who criticized the reform movement in the country, arguing that there can be \\"no reform without independence.\\" Abdellah Guennoun taught and later assisted him in the creation of (, \\"Read\\"), the first series of Arabic textbooks for children in Morocco, published in 1956, 1957, and 1958. an-Nub≈´gh al- Maghribƒ´ In 1938, he published an-Nub≈´gh al-Maghribƒ´ fƒ´ al-adab al- ªArabƒ´ (, Moroccan Intellect in Arabic Literature), his three-volume anthology of Moroccan literature. This anthology indexed and contextualized major Moroccan works of literature written in Arabic, and led to the development of a Moroccan literary canon. Affirming both Morocco's contributions to Arabic literature and the long tradition of Arabic literature in Morocco, an-Nub≈´gh al-Maghribƒ´ was seen as a nationalist reaction to colonialism. It was banned by the authorities of the French Protectorate, and could not be brought into the area under French colonial control, nor could it be sold, displayed, or distributed there. Spain, however, was receptive of the work; an-Nub≈´gh al- Maghribƒ´ was translated into Spanish and Abdallah Guennoun was granted an honorary doctorate from a university in Madrid. He held a number of different positions. In 1937, he was made director of the Khalifi Institute (), then professor at the High Institute of Religion () and the College of Theology in Tetuan (). He held the office of Minister of Justice in the Khalifi government from 1954 to 1956. He became a member of the Arab Academy of Damascus in 1956, the Academy of the Arabic Language in Cairo in 1961, the League of Moroccan Religious Scholars, the al-Quds Scientific Commission () in 1973, the Muslim World League in Mecca as a founding member in 1974, the Jordan Academy of Arabic in 1978, the Iraqi Academy of Sciences in 1979, and the Academy of the Kingdom of Morocco in 1980. In 1981, he founded al-Ihyaa' ( The Revival), a journal published by the Association of Moroccan Academics focusing on Islamic theological sciences and thought from an open, critical perspective.

In 1989, a small capsule containing highly radioactive caesium-137 was found inside the concrete wall of an apartment building, with a surface gamma radiation exposure dose rate of 1800 R/year. The source, originally a part of a radiation level gauge, was lost in the Karansky quarry. The gravel from the quarry was used in construction. The cesium capsule ended up in the concrete panel of Apartment 85 of Building 7 on Gvardeytsiv Kantemirovtsiv Street, between apartments 85 and 52. Over nine years, two families lived in Apartment 85. A child's bed was located directly next to the wall containing the capsule. By the time the capsule was discovered, four residents of the building had died from leukemia and 17 more had received varying doses of radiation. The accident was detected only after the residents requested that the level of radiation be measured in the apartment by a health physicist. Part of the wall was removed and sent to the Institute for Nuclear Research (NASU), where the cesium capsule was removed and disposed of.

It ceased publication as a semimonthly newspaper in December 2011. In February 2012, Glenn-Kipp Publishing, Inc purchased the Just Out brand assets. Just Out ceased being published as a monthly LGBTQ magazine in February 2013. The magazine was available for free at hundreds of businesses across the Portland metropolitan area, and free digital copies are available as PDF files on the web site. Former contributors to Just Out include novelist Marc Acito, Pink Martini pianist Thomas Lauderdale, former Willamette Week art director and Cathartic Comics founder Rupert Kinnard, and reporter and author Peter Zuckerman. USA Today best-selling author Andy Mangels also wrote for the newspaper multiple times over a 25-year period, mostly in the early 2000s.  History  The newspaper's web site used to list many outdoor boxes and other places where Just Out was distributed at no charge. These drop sites could be found throughout the Portland metro area. Up until the mid-2000s there were drop sites elsewhere in Oregon. By the time the paper stopped publication in December 2011, some communities across Oregon had begun receiving Just Out again, including two distribution points in Klamath Falls. On January 21, 2009, Just Outs editorial board issued a statement calling on recently inaugurated Portland mayor Sam Adams to resign, in light of his admission that he had covered up a sexual relationship with a state legislative intern in order to avoid disruptions to his mayoral campaign. Mid- March 2009, three employees ‚Äî news editor Jaymee Cuti, arts-and-culture editor Jim Radosta, and art director Blake Martinez ‚Äî resigned because they had not been paid in full since late January, nor on time for six months. Publisher Marty Davis cited the economic recession and a resulting downturn in ad revenue as the cause of financial troubles. On December 26, 2011, publisher Marty Davis announced that Just Out was out of business effective immediately, with its December 9 issue being its last. On February 14, 2012, it was announced that Glenn-Kipp Publishing, Inc., had acquired Just Out, with Jonathan Kipp as the new publisher, and that Just Out would resume publication. Kipp had contributed to Just Out previously, for two years. it returned as a monthly magazine on June 1, 2012, and ceased publication in February 2013.

It was long used as a basis for rejecting claims,See, for example, In re Russell, 48 F.2d 668, 669 (CCPA 1931) (\\"The mere arrangement of printed matter on a sheet or sheets of paper, in book form or otherwise, does not constitute 'any new and useful art, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter,' or 'any new and useful improvements thereof,' as provided in section 4886 of the Revised Statutes.\\"). but in recent years the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has disapproved of its use.See, for example, In re Lowry, 32 F.3d 1579, 1583 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (cautioning against undue use of printed-matter rejections). The legal analysis of this issue speaks in terms of \\"printed matter\\" that is imprinted upon a \\"substrate.\\" For example, letters might be printed on a piece of paper as substrate, in an extreme case. Or digitized information (the printed matter), such as a jpeg file representative of the Mona Lisa, might be encoded in an EPROM memory chip as substrate. A computer program (the printed matter) might be encoded in a computer-readable medium such as a hard disk (the substrate)--and thus be the subject of a so- called Beauregard claim.According to the Federal Circuit and its predecessor court, at least at one time, placing a tape or disc encoded with a new program into a general-purpose digital computer created a \\"new machine.\\" In re Bernhart, 417 F.2d 1395, 1399 (CCPA 1969). The current legal analysis, as expressed in the definitive decision on printed matter, In re Gulack,703 F.2d 1381, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (\\"the critical question is whether there exists any new and unobvious functional relationship between the printed matter and the substrate.\\"); accord In re Ngai, 367 F.3d 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2004). is as follows: The differences between a newly claimed substrate bearing printed matter and a prior art substrate, where the only point of departure from the prior art is in the printed matter itself, are not entitled to patentable weight unless the printed matter and the substrate have a new and unobvious functional relationship. The analysis is thus essentially an obviousness analysis under section 103 of the patent law,See In re Nuijten, 515 F.3d 1361, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (dissenting opinion of Linn, J.) (\\"the PTO considers the patentability of such claims under the 'printed matter' doctrine of ¬ß 103\\") rather than (as it was in earlier times) an analysis of statutory subject matter under what is now section 101 of the patent law.See In re Miller, 418 F.2d 1392, 1396 (CCPA 1969) (\\"printed matter by itself is not patentable subject matter, because non-statutory\\"). Patents of this type still issue. One example is Seagate's SeaShield patent, No. U.S. Pat. 5,732,464 (method of informing users how to configure disc drive by putting label on shield), which is claimed to provide a functional relationship between the printed information and the metal shield on which it is imprinted. USPTO practice Practice in the United States Patent and Trademark Office is described in the USPTO Manual of Patent Examining Procedure, ¬ß 2111.05.MPEP ¬ß 2111.05 Generally, Examples where such a functional relationship is present include inventions in which \\"indicia on a measuring cup perform the function of indicating volume within that measuring cup\\" and in which \\" a hatband places a string of numbers in a certain physical relationship to each other such that a claimed algorithm is satisfied due to the physical structure of the hatband....\\" Examples where such a functional relationship is absent include inventions in which \\"a product merely serves as a support for printed matter,\\" e.g., \\"a hatband with images displayed on the hatband but not arranged in any particular sequence\\" or \\"a deck of playing cards having images on each card.\\" Even if such a realtionship exists, it must still be new and unobvious to support patentability.

It consists of more than 30 games, the first of which ‚Äì a shoot 'em up ‚Äì was Germany's most popular computer game in the early 2000s. Since 2001, most games have been released under the name Crazy Chicken in English, however some of the PC games and the first DS game were marketed in North America by Encore (MumboJumbo for the DS game) under the name Chicken Hunter. History The game (now distributed as Die Original Moorhuhn Jagd) was developed by the Dutch Witan studios and the Art Department advertising agency as an advertisement for Johnnie Walker whisky in 1999. Imitating the Glorious Twelfth, the game's objective was to shoot down, through a point-and-click interface, as many cartoonish \\"swamp chickens\\" (; literally \\"moorhens\\", i.e. willow ptarmigans) as possible in 90 seconds. The game was originally known as KippenSchieten and won third place at the Bizarre 98 programmer's meeting. The game was originally not intended for distribution, but was made available to play on laptops in bars by promoters dressed up as hunters. It was soon illicitly copied, however, and became widely available for download on private websites. The publisher's initial irritation at this subsided after the game received favorable mentions in popular media and demand for it grew. From 1999 onwards the game was officially made available for download by Art Department. It became wildly popular in German-speaking Europe, to the point of being denounced in the media as a threat to the bottom line of businesses, on account of the number of hours wasted by employees playing the game. The game's success spawned a great deal of merchandise, a comic book series, an animated TV series, several motion picture scripts (although no movie was ever made) and a BMG-produced single (Gimme more Huhn by comedian Wigald Boning). It also caused Germany's authoritative Duden dictionary to include the word \\"Moorhuhn\\". Corporate history Propelled by the game's popularity, its Bochum-based publisher Phenomedia AG, who had acquired Art Department, went public in late 1999 at the height of the dot-com bubble and attained a market value of up to one billion Euro. In 2002, the stock value rapidly collapsed after it became known that the company's leaders were under investigation for falsifying balance sheets. Chairman of the Vorstand Markus Scheer and CFO (Finanzvorstand) Bj√∂rn Denhard, who confessed to the falsifications, were fired. In 2009, they were sentenced by a German court to 46 and 36 months' imprisonment, respectively, for securities fraud and other infractions. Phenomedia AG underwent insolvency proceedings. Its assets, including the Moorhuhn series, were bought by a successor company, phenomedia publishing GmbH, which continues to publish Moorhuhn games. But now the series is owned by the company AK tronic due to phenomedia going bankrupt.

Plot Jimmy (James Aubrey) and Michael (Nicholas Gecks) were best friends at school in the 1960s. They played guitar and sang together and dreamed of becoming the next Lennon and McCartney or Simon and Garfunkel. Their partnership ended when Michael decided to become a priest. Jimmy eventually became a university lecturer of English literature. The two meet again twenty years later when Jimmy sees posters advertising one of Michael's regular fundraising concerts in his church hall. At first, the two are delighted to see each other, but they gradually remember the events that drove them apart. The events are shown in flashback. At one of their concerts, Jimmy (played in flashback by Julian Firth) catches sight of Maureen (Oona Kirsch) and tells Michael (Jason Carter) that he has fallen in love. During a strip game involving a music quiz, Maureen becomes topless, which attracts Michael's attention and eventually the two of them make love after one of Jimmy and Michael's concerts. The events of the past are mirrored in the present day. Father Michael is good friends with Mary (Karen Archer, previously in Giro City) and her son Paul (Liam Holt), who idolises him and wants to become a priest himself. However, Jimmy and Mary get together. The IMDB entry for Forever Young describes this as an act of revenge by Jimmy. Paul discovers them making love and runs away to the church. Michael insists that Paul return home. Thus Michael loses the friendship of Jimmy, Karen and Paul and at the end of the film he is shown bereft. Music The film is full of music from the 1950s. The lyrics to the theme music to the film, the song Forever Young, were written by Ray Connolly to a tune based on Farewell to Stromness by Peter Maxwell Davies.

In addition, the extent of the protection conferred by a European patent or a European patent application is determined by the claims, with the description and drawings being used to interpret the claims.  Patent Cooperation Treaty  Under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, notably provides that the drawings are required when they are necessary for the understanding of the invention.. See also . specifies special physical requirements for drawings in an international application.  United States  1868 patent drawing for the Sholes, Glidden, and Soule typewriter. In the United States, the applicant for a patent is required by law to furnish a drawing of the invention whenever the nature of the case requires a drawing to understand the invention. This drawing must be filed with the application. This includes practically all inventions except compositions of matter or processes, but a drawing may also be useful in the case of many processes. The drawing must show every feature of the invention specified in the claims, and is required by the U.S. patent office rules to be in a particular form. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) specifies the size of the sheet on which the drawing is made, the type of paper, the margins, and other details relating to the making of the drawing. The reason for specifying the standards in detail is that the drawings are printed and published in a uniform style when the patent issues, and the drawings must also be such that they can be readily understood by persons using the patent descriptions. No names or other identification are permitted within the ‚Äúsight‚Äù of the drawing, and applicants are expected to use the space above and between the hole locations to identify each sheet of drawings. This identification may consist of the attorney‚Äôs name and docket number or the inventor‚Äôs name and application number and may include the sheet number and the total number of sheets filed (for example, ‚Äúsheet 2 of 4‚Äù). The following rule, reproduced from title 37 of the Code of Federal Regulations, relates to the standards for drawings: = History = Patent model for loom. From 1790 to 1880 in the US, patent models were required. A patent model was a scratch-built miniature model no larger than 12\\" by 12\\" by 12\\", approximately 30 cm by 30 cm by 30 cm, that showed how an invention works. Some inventors still willingly submitted models at the turn of the twentieth century. In some cases, an inventor may still want to present a \\"working model\\" as an evidence to prove actual reduction to practice in an interference proceeding. In some jurisdictions patent models stayed an aid to demonstrate the operation of the invention. In applications involving genetics, samples of genetic material or DNA sequences may be required. The United States patent law was revised in 1793. It stated that the Commissioner of the USPTO could ask for additional information, drawings, or diagrams if the description is not clear. By then, the rate of patent grants had grown to about 20 per year and the time burden on the Secretary of State was considered to be too burdensome. Patent applications were no longer examined. Patents were granted simply by submitting a written description of an invention, a model of the invention, if appropriate, and paying a fee of $30 then, and now $1000 in 2006 US dollars. = Drawings and photographs = Examples of subject matter that should be filed as photographs In utility and design patent applications, drawings can be in black ink or color. Black and white drawings are normally required. On rare occasions, color drawings may be necessary as the only practical medium by which to disclose the subject matter sought to be patented in a utility or design patent application or the subject matter of a statutory invention registration. Black and white photographs are not ordinarily permitted in utility and design patent applications, unless this is the only practicable medium for illustrating the claimed invention. For example, photographs of electrophoresis gels, blots, autoradiographs, cell cultures, histological tissue cross sections, animals, plants, in vivo imaging, etc. Color photographs can be accepted in utility and design patent applications if the conditions for accepting color drawings and black and white photographs have been satisfied. = Features = Gillette's patent drawing of the Razor, 1904.

It is described by Tacitus in his Histories at 2.14-15. The exact location of this battle is not mentioned by the historian, however, he alludes to its taking place in Gallia Narbonensis, possibly near modern Fr√©jus.  Prelude  After assuming the imperial throne during the civil war, Otho campaigned to secure the passes in the Alps bordering Gaul, as well as those territories whose loyalties toward him were in doubt. As a part of these campaigns, he sent his fleet to secure Gallia Narbonensis, which had sworn allegiance to Vitellius, Otho's primary opposition, and potential (and later successful) usurper of the throne. According to Tacitus (Histories 2.14), Fabius Valens, after hearing of the threat to Gallia Narbonensis, responded as follows:  Battle  The battle began as soon as the armies met. A rash attack on behalf of the Vitellian auxiliaries led to them being surrounded: Despite the loss, the Vitellianist forces, specifically the fierce Tungrian auxiliaries, retaliated against their enemy, who had relaxed in the joy of victory (Histories 2.15):  Aftermath  The Vitellianists retreated to Antipolis, a town of Gallia Narbonensis, the Othonianists to Albigaunum, in Upper Liguria, who subsequently blockaded the province from unfriendly forces. When Fabius Valens heard of the loss, he sent a detachment of Batavian auxiliaries to the relief of the province. Tacitus makes a note of this action (Histories 2.28) with an anecdote on the well- known strength of the Batavians, and the subsequent risings of a mutiny on behalf of the Vitellianist legions. Due to the feeling of fear/loss that the legions had when these brave compatriots of theirs were sent away for the aforementioned mission, Valens was forced to deal with said brief mutiny of his troops.

Development and history The Invasion of Poland had shown that the towed sIG 33 guns assigned to the infantry gun companies of the motorized infantry regiments had difficulties keeping up with the tanks during combat. The easiest solution was to modify a spare tank chassis to carry it into battle. A sIG 33 was mounted on the chassis of the Panzer I Ausf. B, complete with carriage and wheels, in place of the turret and superstructure. Plates thick were used to form a tall, open-topped fighting compartment on the forward part of the hull. This protected little more than the gun and the gunner himself from small arms fire and shell fragments, the loaders being completely exposed. The rearmost section of armor was hinged to ease reloading. There was no room to stow any ammunition, so it had to be carried by a separate vehicle. When mounted, the sIG 33 had a total traverse of 25¬∞ and could elevate from -4¬∞ to +75¬∞. The gun used an Rblf36 sight. The chassis was overloaded and breakdowns were frequent. The vehicle's extreme height and lack of on-board ammunition were severe tactical drawbacks. Thirty-eight were converted in February 1940 by Alkett.

Life  Miki Mal√∂r studied music at the music and art academy in Vienna (MA, 1981). In addition, over the years she also had the following training: massage diploma (1994), diving instructor (PADI‚ÄìInstructor 1995) and cave diver (NACD Full Cave 1997). Her beginnings as pianist and stage musician in cabaret and theatre performances, and as clownish singer with the rock theatre group :de:Hallucination Company (1982/83) were followed by twelve years of solo tours through Europe. Characteristic for this period are the term \\"Comic Theatre\\" for her works and her declining to be catalogued as Kabarett artist. In 1986 she was awarded the F√∂rderpreis der Stadt Mainz on occasion of the awards for the de:Deutscher Kleinkunstpreis. Since 1995, she has abandoned cabaret and radicalised her works. The next stage were performances, installations and post-dramatic theatre. Apart from working on her own pieces, she frequently directs off-theatre productions. Miki Mal√∂r regularly produces in Vienna.  Works  Miki Mal√∂r's works elude unilateral attributions: they are inspired by the avant-gardes of the 20th century, postmodern, deconstructivist, subversive, alternative, experimental, post- dramatic, feminist, rhizomatic, sensual, absurd, highly comical, intimate, transgressing taboos, excessive, and much more. Her works are neither based on drama pieces, nor are they meta-narrations, and there are no actors impersonating roles. She exclusively realises her own pieces and favours working with performers, dancers, and laypersons. Another mark of her works is her special attachment to music; her frequent trade with objects indicates a close relationship with the fine arts. The bandwidth of her themes is extensive: one underwater piece (\\"Vampyroteuthis Infernalis\\"), two Schubert cycles (\\"Transit\\", \\"Prey\\"), \\"Veiling. A (Social) Game\\", \\"Hysteria!\\", \\"nationalANTHEMS‚Äù and the cult film remake \\"The Attack of the 50 Foot Woman\\". Many of her pieces focus on female desire (e.g., \\"Desire As Will To Be Trapped\\", as well as the ongoing performance cycle \\"Anima\\"). These more and more often result in cross-genre film works (\\"Interior Design\\"). Miki Mal√∂r's theatre is fed by philosophical and depth psychological theories, the last results of which were some works on Deleuze/Guattari about the theme of Desiring Machines (\\"The Lady Who Ate 100 Cakes\\", \\"Tigerbalm\\", \\"100 Objects to Represent Theatre\\"). These works can be read as an attempt at interpreting the unconscious as a model of incessant and unfettered productivity. This leads to machines, fabrics, tableaux of desire, vestal machines of subversion, where Miki Mal√∂r's analytic background is embedded in passion, risk, and touch. Instead of representation, the impersonation on stage, there is doing, pure productivity which replaces psychological play with a radical language of images free for association. Miki Mal√∂r has been working together with stage director Miguel √Ångel Gaspar for several years.

It identified the fight against terrorism a top national security priority. Background During his administration, President Clinton worked to deepen cooperation with U.S. allies, strengthen law enforcement counter-terrorism tools and improve airplane and airport security. Before September 11, 2001, these efforts had paid off by foiling major terrorist plots and apprehending, trying and sentencing terrorists. Due to America's military strength and superiority, potential enemies are more likely to attack through means of terror instead of conventional military assault. Easier access to sophisticated technology means that the destructive power available to terrorists is greater than ever. Terrorists could potentially use weapons of mass destruction to cause physical destruction or advanced computer technology to attack our economy and critical infrastructure. Presidential Decision Directive 62 addresses these challenges by creating a new and more systematic approach to fighting the terrorist threat of the next century. It reinforces the mission of the many U.S. agencies charged with roles in defeating terrorism; it also codifies and clarifies their activities in the wide range of U.S. counter-terrorism programs, from apprehension and prosecution of terrorists to increasing transportation security, enhancing response capabilities and protecting the computer-based systems that lie at the heart of America's economy. PDD-62 is a classified document. It is meant to reaffirm PDD-39, \\"United States Policy on Counterterrorism.\\" As such, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) will continue to serve as the Lead Federal Agency for \\"crisis management\\" and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will continue to serve as the Lead Federal Agency for \\"consequence management.\\"http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/blaw/general/pdd62.htm PDD-39 Presidential Decision Directive 39 (PDD-39), U.S. Policy on Counterterrorism, was signed on June 21, 1995 by President Clinton. It defines policies regarding the federal response to threats or acts of terrorism involving nuclear, biological, or chemical materials or weapons of mass destruction (NBC/WMD). Section 3 states: \\"We shall have the ability to respond rapidly and decisively to terrorism directed against us wherever it occurs, to protect Americans, arrest or defeat the perpetrators, respond with all appropriate instruments against the sponsoring organizations and governments and provide recovery relief to victims, as permitted by law.\\" Since the official document is classified, a fact sheet on Presidential Decision Directive 62 was released by the White House in May 1998 listing the following details of the directive. Outline =General= It is increasingly likely that terrorist groups, or individuals with criminal intent, may use unconventional methods to disrupt the Nation's critical infrastructure or use weapons of mass destruction (WMD) against Americans. As these types of threats mature, it is necessary to prepare to deter them, prevent them from occurring, or, if need be, limit the damage to a minimum. Success is dependent upon possessing the capability for an integrated response, and in the case of critical infrastructure protection, having public/private partnerships. =Present achievements and current challenges= :Present achievements :*An increased rate of apprehensions and convictions; :*An increase in counterterrorism legislative authorities; :*An increase in the funding for consequence management planning; :*An increase in the importance of terrorism on the diplomatic agenda; :*Growth of assistance to, and cooperation with, other democracies in combating terrorism; and :*Improving and expanding a professionally trained interagency cadre. :Current challenges :*Terrorist groups may choose asymmetrical attacks on our domestic and international vulnerabilities, through the use of WMD and/or cyber warfare; :*Terrorist groups possess the knowledge, skills, and abilities to use WMD; :*Former \\"cold war\\" civil defense programs have been downsized or dismantled, and cities are not prepared to deal with a large-scale event; :*Improvements in technology will make it difficult for law enforcement agencies to detect and prevent terrorist acts; and :*The Nation's critical infrastructure relies heavily on the use of computers, which are prone to cyber attacks. =Consequences management= In the event of a terrorism incident, the Federal Government will respond rapidly, working with State and local governments, to restore order and deliver emergency assistance. FEMA, the Lead Federal Agency for consequence management, is responsible for preparing for and responding to the consequences of a WMD incident with participation of other departments and agencies including the Public Health Service (PHS), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Department of Energy (DOE]), as necessary. The Department of Justice (DOJ), through the FBI, is the Lead Federal Agency for crisis management and operational response to a weapon of mass destruction incident. Domestically, key Federal agencies and Departments, through interagency efforts, will continue training and providing equipment to first responders to prepare them for response to WMD incidents. Emphasis will be placed on preparing those responders in the largest 120 cities. The Department of Defense, in coordination with other Federal Departments and agencies, will provide training to metropolitan first responders and will maintain trained military units to assist State and local responders. One example is the US National Guard concept of initially forming 10 Rapid Assessment and Initial Detection (RAID) teams in each FEMA Region. These teams are designed to provide rapid response to a WMD incident and assist State and local responders. PHS, in the Department of Health and Human Services, is the Lead Federal Agency in planning and preparing for response to WMD-related medical emergencies. PHS will continue supporting State and local governments in developing Metropolitan Medical Strike Teams; maintaining the National Disaster Medical System; and, in conjunction with the Department of Veterans Affairs, stockpiling antidotes and pharmaceuticals in the event of a WMD incident. =Equipment= DOJ, in coordination with FEMA, will provide equipment to State and local emergency responders. =Critical infrastructure= It is imperative that the United States be adequately prepared to deal with attacks on critical infrastructure and cyber systems. As such, the President reviewed the recommendations of the Presidential Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection and has signed PDD-63, entitled Protecting America's Critical Infrastructures (PDD-63 is For Official Use Only). A white paper, entitled \\"The Clinton Administration's Policy on Critical Infrastructure Protection: Presidential Decision Directive-63,\\" is available at www.whitehouse.gov/WH/EOP/NSC/htm/NSCSDoo3.html. This white paper outlines the Administration's program to deal with threats to our Nation's critical infrastructure. National coordinator PDD-62 also establishes the office of the National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection and Counter-Terrorism. The National Coordinator oversees the broad variety of relevant policies and programs including areas such as counter-terrorism, protection of critical infrastructure, preparedness and consequence management for weapons of mass destruction. The National Coordinator works within the National Security Council, reports to the President through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (the National Security Advisor) and produces for him an annual Security Preparedness Report. The National Coordinator also provides advice regarding budgets for counter-terror programs and coordinates the development of guidelines that might be needed for crisis management.

It was constructed by the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) with assistance from the World Bank ( the dam does not appear on EGAT's website.) The 17 m high dam was projected to cost 140 million baht. Its final cost was 871 million baht, not including compensation payments to affected residents. Background The Rasi Salai Dam was constructed by the Department of Energy Development and Promotion (DEDP) as part of the Khong-Chee-Mun Water Diversion Project. The project envisioned the building of 13 dams on the Chi and Mun Rivers over 42 years. It was thought that the diversion of water from the Mekong into the two rivers would end water shortages in northeastern Thailand. The entire diversion project was estimated to cost 228 billion baht. Villagers claim that DEDP did not release any information to the public before or during the dam's construction. DEDP claimed it was building a 4.5-metre rubber weir that would not raise water levels above the riverbank. In reality, the state agency was building a nine- metre concrete dam. No environmental assessment was ever conducted given that the DEDP claimed it was a small-scale project. Living River Siam, a Thai NGO, helped villagers document the effects of the dam on their lives. EGAT promised that the dam's waters would be used to irrigate local fields, but the dam flooded the ancient salt dome on which it was constructed. The result was non- potable brackish water that made nearby fields toxic to cultivation. Angry villagers occupied the dam site for two years and petitioned the government to close it down. The dam's gates were opened in 2000 pending a permanent resolution of the issue. The water management system decided upon involves opening the dam's gates for four months every year, June to September. Compensation After on-going demonstrations by villagers, in 2000 the DEDP paid compensation to private property owners only. Those who toiled on common land were not compensated. As a result of 18 demonstrations against the Rasi Salai Dam, the Chavalit government paid compensation to 1,154 of the 3,000 affected families. Squabbles over compensation divided families and communities. In April 2019, almost 30 years after the dam's construction, the Royal Irrigation Department (RID), which took over the project from the Energy Ministry in 2002, agreed to make a final compensation payment of 600 million baht. RID will pay 32,000 baht per rai over the next two years to those impacted by the dam. From 1997 to 2017, up to 1.927 billion baht has been paid in compensation to farmers for 60,000 rai (9,600 hectares) of affected land. This final package will cover a remaining 8,469 rai (1,355 hectares) of land affected by the dam.

He composed it in Leipzig for the first Sunday after Easter and first performed it on April 8, 1725.  History and words  Bach composed the cantata in Leipzig for the First Sunday after Easter, called Quasimodogeniti. He composed it in his second annual cycle, which consisted of chorale cantatas since the first Sunday after Trinity of 1724. Bach ended the sequence on Palm Sunday of 1725, this cantata is not a chorale cantata and the only cantata in the second cycle to begin with an extended sinfonia. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from the First Epistle of John, \\"our faith is the victory\\" (), and from the Gospel of John, the appearance of Jesus to the Disciples, first without then with Thomas, in Jerusalem (). The unknown poet included verse 19 from the Gospel to begin the cantata, later as movement 4 the first stanza of the chorale \\"\\" (1632) by , which had been attributed also to Johann Michael Altenburg, and as the closing chorale two stanzas which had appeared added to Martin Luther's \\"\\": \\"\\", Luther's German version of (Give peace, Lord, 1531), and \\"\\" (Give our rulers and all lawgivers), a stanza by Johann Walter paraphrasing (1566), concluded with a final amen. Werner Neumann suggested that Bach himself may have been the anonymous poet, while Charles Sanford Terry proposed Christian Weiss. Bach scholar Alfred D√ºrr supposed that it is the same author who wrote , first performed six days earlier on Easter Monday of 1725. After the quote from the Gospel of John, the poet paraphrases, in movement 3, words of Jesus from the Gospel of Matthew, , \\"\\" (For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them). Bach first performed the cantata on 8 April 1725, and again in Leipzig at least twice, on 1 April 1731 and either on 1 April 1742 or on 7 April 1743.  Scoring and structure  The cantata in seven movements is scored for soprano, alto, tenor, and bass soloists, a four-part choir only in the closing chorale, two oboes, bassoon, two violins, viola and basso continuo. The reason for the choir appearing only in the closing chorale may have been that the Thomanerchor had been in high demand during the Holy Week and Easter, performing , the St John Passion and , among others. # Sinfonia # Recitative (tenor): # Aria (alto): # Aria (soprano and tenor): # Recitative (bass): # Aria (bass): # Chorale:  Music  Possibly Bach took the opening sinfonia from earlier music. According to John Eliot Gardiner, this movement and the first aria are both taken from Bach's lost congratulatory cantata , celebrating the 24th birthday of Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-K√∂then on 10 December 1718. Alfred D√ºrr believed that it is a movement from a concerto. It does not highlight a particular solo instrument (although Julian Mincham sees a close resemblance to concerti which do, such as the opening movements of Violin Concerto in E major, BWV 1042, and the keyboard concerto, BWV 1053). Rather it is a type of concerto grosso (or \\"concerto a due cori\\", concerto for two choirs), the strings interacting with a concertino of the woodwinds, oboes and bassoon. The two groups first introduce their own lively themes, which are distinct but related to each other. Then they also exchange their themes and play together. The middle section begins with a surprising new motif for oboe and bassoon, which Bach himself marked \\"cantabile\\". The Bible quote is sung in recitative by the tenor as the Evangelist, accompanied by the continuo in repeated fast notes, possibly illustrating the anxious heart beat of the disciples, when Jesus appears, \\"On the evening, however, of the same Sabbath, when the disciples had gathered and the door was locked out of fear of the Jews, Jesus came and walked among them\\". In movement 3, an aria marked adagio, the repetition is kept in the bassoon, but the strings hold long chords and the oboes play extended melodic lines. According to D√ºrr, it may have been another movement from the same concerto that movement 1 relies on. Bach composed the chorale text of movement 4, \\"Do not despair, o little flock\\", as a duet, accompanied only by the continuo including bassoon. Fragments of the usual chorale theme, \\"\\", can be detected occasionally. Terry interprets that the bassoon obbligato was intended to accompany a chorale melody which \\"never actually sounded\\", conveying the \\"hiddenness\\" of the church in the world. The bass prepares in a recitative, ending as an arioso, the last aria, which is accompanied by the divided violins and the continuo. The theme is again a contrast between the \\"\\" (restlessness of \\"the world\\") and \\"\\" (peace with Jesus). While the instruments play in wild motion, the bass sings a calm expressive melody, only accenting the word \\"\\" (persecution) by faster motion in long melismas. According to Mincham, this aria might go back to a different movement from the same concerto as the sinfonia. The chorale theme of Luther's chorale was published by Martin Luther in the (edited by Johann Walter), published in N√ºrnberg in 1531), and then in the by Joseph Klug (Wittenberg, 1535). The melody of the additional stanza (\\"\\") was first published in in Wittenberg, 1566. Bach set it for four parts.

Gunmen broke into their house at night and shot all eight males inside, in an apparent sectarian attack. The victims were businessman Owen McMahon, four of his sons, and one of his employees. Two others were shot but survived, and a female family member was assaulted. The survivors said that most of the gunmen wore police uniforms and it is suspected that they were members of the Ulster Special Constabulary. It is believed to have been a reprisal for the Irish Republican Army's (IRA) killing of two policemen the day before. Northern Ireland had been created ten months before, in the midst of the Irish War of Independence. A truce ended the war in most of Ireland; but a sectarian conflict in Belfast, and fighting in border areas, continued. Northern Ireland's police forces ‚Äì especially the USC, which was almost exclusively Protestant and unionist ‚Äì were implicated in a number of attacks on Catholic and Irish nationalist civilians as reprisal for IRA actions. A week later, six more Catholics were killed in another reprisal attack. Background In July 1921, a truce was agreed between representatives of the Irish Republic and the British Government, ending the Irish War of Independence in most of Ireland. The Anglo-Irish Treaty had been signed in December 1921, which copper-fastened the Partition of Ireland: most of Ireland became the Irish Free State, while Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom. Violence continued in Northern Ireland after the truce. In the first half of 1922, in the words of historian Robert Lynch, the Irish Republican Army (IRA), \\"would make one final attempt to undermine the ever hardening reality of partition by launching an all out offensive on the recently established province of Northern Ireland\\". To counter the IRA, the new unionist Government of Northern Ireland established the Ulster Special Constabulary (USC), a quasi-military reserve police force to the Royal Irish Constabulary, which was first deployed in February 1921. The USC had a mutually hostile relationship with both pro-Treaty nationalists and anti- Treaty republicans in the area which became Northern Ireland. Lynch writes of the USC: \\"some were polite and courteous, others merely arrogant and destructive whilst a small anonymous minority set out to kill\\". The McMahon killings are believed to have been a reprisal for the IRA's killing of two USC policemen in Belfast. On 23 March 1922, USC officers Thomas Cunningham and William Cairnside were patrolling Great Victoria Street in the city centre when they were approached by a group of IRA members and shot dead. Two Catholics, Peter Murphy (61) and Sarah McShane (15), were later shot dead in a suspected reprisal attack several hours later in the Catholic Short Strand area by unidentified gunmen. The McMahon family had no connection to any paramilitary violence. Owen McMahon was a supporter and personal friend of Joe Devlin, the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) Member of Parliament, an Irish nationalist who rejected republican violence. McMahon was a prosperous businessman, who owned several pubs in Belfast (one of which was The Capstan Bar on Ann Street) and had at one time been chairman of the Northern Vintners' Association. His home at Kinnaird Terrace, off the Antrim Road in north- central Belfast, near the New Lodge area, was described as a \\"sprawling Victorian mansion\\". Killings At about 1:00 am on 24 March 1922, two men wearing police uniforms seized a sledgehammer from a Corporation workman, who was guarding a building site at Carlisle Circus. A curfew was in place at the time, due to the daily violence in the city. At nearby Clifton Avenue they met three other men and the party of five proceeded to the home of Owen McMahon. Eight males and three women were in the house that night. The males were Owen, his six sons, and Edward McKinney. McKinney was from Desertegney near Buncrana, County Donegal, across the border in the Irish Free State. He worked for the McMahons as a barman. The women were Owen's wife Eliza, her daughter and her niece. At about 1:20 am, the gang used the sledgehammer to break down the door of the McMahon household. Owen's wife, Eliza, said that four of the men wore police caps and carried revolvers while another wore civilian clothes. John McMahon, one of Owen's sons, said \\"Four of the five men were dressed in the uniform of the RIC but, from their appearance, I know they are Specials, not regular RIC\\". All of the men had hidden their faces. The four men in police uniform rushed up the stairs and herded the males into the dining room. The women were taken into another room. Eliza \\"got down on her knees and pleaded for mercy, but was struck on the side of the head and fell to the floor\\". When Owen asked why his family was being singled-out, one of the gunmen said it was because he was \\"a respected papist\\". The gunmen said \\"you boys say your prayers\\", before opening fire. The shooting continued for five minutes; five of the men were killed outright and two were wounded, one fatally. Owen McMahon (50), Gerard McMahon (15), Frank McMahon (24), Patrick McMahon (22) and Edward McKinney (25) were killed outright while Bernard McMahon (26) died later. The youngest McMahon son, 12-year-old Michael, survived the attack by hiding behind furniture and pretending to be hit. John McMahon (30) survived despite serious gunshot wounds. Eliza McMahon raised the alarm by opening the drawing room window and shouting \\"Murder! Murder!\\" A matron at an adjoining nursing home was alerted and phoned the police and an ambulance. mural referring to killings allegedly by members of the RIC in Belfast in 1920‚Äì22 It has been alleged that a group of policemen operating out of Brown Square barracks in the Shankill Road area were behind the killings, but this has never been proved according to The Daily Telegraph. Historian Tim Pat Coogan believes the police were responsible. An inquiry was carried out by the Department of Defence of the Irish Free State, but not by the Northern Irish authorities. A 1924 Free State report alleged that twelve policemen, whom the report identified by name, had carried out the McMahon murders, as well as several other attacks on Catholics. Aftermath The killings caused outrage among Belfast's Catholic population and over 10,000 people attended the funerals of those killed. The funerals of Owen, Gerard, Frank and Patrick were held on Sunday 26 March. The British Army lined the route of the funeral procession ‚Äì from north Belfast to Milltown Cemetery ‚Äì anticipating it would be attacked. Edward McKinney was buried on the same day, Sunday, 26 March, in Cockhill Cemetery just outside Buncrana. At the funeral Mass for the victims at St Patrick's Church, Rev Bernard Laverty told the congregation that even the Black and Tans \\"had not been guilty of anything approaching this [crime] in its unspeakable barbarity\\". The McMahons had been \\"done to death merely because they were Catholics\\", but he told the mourners to practise \\"patience and forbearance\\" and not to seek revenge. Irish Nationalist Party MP Joe Devlin told the British Parliament, \\"If Catholics have no revolvers to protect themselves they are murdered. If they have revolvers they are flogged and sentenced to death\\". David Lloyd George and Winston Churchill, worried that the violence would collapse of the new Northern Ireland administration, organised a meeting in London between Irish republican leader Michael Collins and Sir James Craig, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, both to try to stop the IRA violence which Collins had been tacitly encouraging and supporting, and to pressure Craig to provide more protection for Catholics. Craig denied the nationalist assertion that the McMahon killings were part of an anti-Catholic pogrom on behalf of state forces, telling the Parliament of Northern Ireland that, \\"no such thing has ever been the policy of Protestants here ... The Ulster men are up against, not Catholics but ... up against rebels, that they are up against murder, Bolshevism and up against those enemies not only of Ulster but of the [British] Empire\\". The killings were part of a series of reprisals on Catholics for IRA attacks in Belfast and elsewhere. The following week saw an incident known as the \\"Arnon Street killings\\", in which five Catholics were killed by uniformed police in revenge for the killing of a policeman on the Old Lodge Road. In total, 452 people would be killed in Belfast in the conflict between June 1920 and July 1922 ‚Äì 267 Catholics and 185 Protestants. No one was ever prosecuted for the killings but DI John William Nixon was forced to step down from the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), albeit on full pension, in 1924 after being heard giving (in breach of police regulations) a political speech to an Orange Order meeting saying that, \\"not an inch of Ulster should be yielded\\" to the Free State.

It was located outside Szil√°gysomly√≥ in the village of Somly√≥csehi, Szil√°gy County, Kingdom of Hungary (Romanian: Cehei, today part of »òimleu Silvaniei, SƒÉlaj County, Romania) as the territory became part of Hungary again from the 1940 Second Vienna Award's grant of Northern Transylvania until the end of World War II. It was active in the spring of 1944, following Operation Margarethe. History Romania's 1930 census found some 14,000 Jews living in SƒÉlaj County, but this number had fallen to 8,000 by 1944. In 1942 and 1943, the county's male Jews aged 16 to 60 had been sent to perform forced labor on the Eastern Front, on the Ukrainian border, accounting for the fall in population. Thus, those sent to the ghetto were women, children, the elderly and the sick. Alina Pop, \\"Cum erau umili≈£i evreii √Æn ghetoul de la Cehei\\", AdevƒÉrul, October 9, 2013; accessed October 10, 2013 The decision to set it up was taken at a conference held in Szatm√°rn√©meti (Satu Mare) on April 26, attended by Andr√°s Gazda, assistant to the county prefect; J√°nos Sr√©ter, mayor of Zilah (ZalƒÉu); J√≥zsef Udvari, mayor of Szil√°gysomly√≥ (»òimleu Silvaniei); lieutenant colonel Gy√∂rgy Mariska, commander of the county's gendarmerie unit; Ferenc Elekes, chief of police of Zilah (ZalƒÉu); and Istv√°n Pethes, his counterpart in Szil√°gysomly√≥ (»òimleu Silvaniei). The isp√°n of the county, Baron J√°nos J√≥sika, immediately resigned upon being informed of the conference's decisions by his assistance, holding the planned course of action to be immoral and illegal. His successor L√°szl√≥ Szl√°vi, sent by the D√∂me Szt√≥jay, fully cooperated with the program. Following the officials' return from Szatm√°rn√©meti (Satu Mare), discussions took place in the prefect's office among local officials regarding the ghetto's physical location. \\"Ghettoes\\" at the Northern Transylvania Holocaust Memorial Museum site; accessed October 10, 2013 In Szil√°gysomly√≥ (»òimleu Silvaniei), the Jews were rounded up under the direct command of Istv√°n Pethes; in Zilah (ZalƒÉu), by Ferenc Elekes; in the rest of the county, under orders from Andr√°s Gazda and the direct supervision of Gy√∂rgy Mariska. Among the larger communities affected were those at Tasn√°d (TƒÉ»ônad) and Kraszna (Crasna). The Jews were forced to live on the precincts of the Klein brick factory in Somly√≥csehi (Cehei), in a swampy and muddy area some 5 km distant from the center of Szil√°gyosmly√≥ (≈ûimleu Silvaniei). At its peak, there were nearly 8,500 inhabitants, including Jews from the districts of Kraszna, Szil√°gycseh, Zsib√≥, Szil√°gysomly√≥, Als√≥szopor, Tasn√°d and Zilah. As the brick shelters could not accommodate everyone, many ghetto residents had to live outside. Security was provided by a special gendarmerie unit from Budapest commanded by Krasznai, a man noted for his cruelty. He practiced constant humiliation of the Jews; in one incident, he led them to the ghetto fence, where they excreted onto a field. He ordered their picture taken, blowing it up and placing it in a shop window in town, with the legend, \\"this is the lesson of the yids in the Cehei ghetto\\". At other times, Jews would be forced up a hill, some of them savagely beaten in order to obtain information about where their valuables were hidden. Those watching the beatings were also expected to reveal what they knew. Conditions in the ghetto were such as to keep inhabitants barely alive during the three to four weeks they spent there. Due to physical torture, lack of food and of water, the Jews of Szil√°gys√°g (SƒÉlaj) reached Auschwitz concentration camp in particularly poor shape, so that an unusually high percentage were selected for the gas chambers immediately upon arrival. The deportations from Somly√≥csehi (Cehei) took place in three transports: May 31 (3,106), June 3 (3,161) and June 6 (1,584), with a total of 7,851 Jews sent to Auschwitz.\\"The Holocaust in Northern Transylvania\\" at the Yad Vashem site; accessed October 10, 2013 Some 1,200 Jews survived the Holocaust but later emigrated from Romania, so that by the 2000s, under fifty Jews remained in the county.

It was built by a road construction crew in 1924. When the road was finished the United States Forest Service began using it to house fire crews assigned to patrol the surrounding National Forest. The Forest Service now rents the cabin to recreational visitors. The Willow Prairie Cabin is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  History  The Willow Prairie Cabin was built in 1924 by a Forest Service road crew that was constructing a highway from Butte Falls to Fish Lake. Because the forest roads were not well developed, it was impractical for workers to make a daily round-trip from Butte Falls to the remote Willow Prairie construction site. To facilitate work at the sites, the road crew used the Willow Prairie Cabin as their base-camp from 1924 until the highway was finished in 1926.\\"Willow Prairie Cabin - Oregon\\", Recreation Rentals of the Pacific Northwest, Pacific Northwest Region, United States Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Portland, Oregon, 30 July 2008.McFadden, Tish and Tom Foley, How to Rent a Fire Lookout in the Pacific Northwest (2nd Edition), Wilderness Press, Berkeley, California, May 2005, pp. 105-107. When the road was completed, the Forest Service began using the cabin as a barracks to house fire crews assigned to patrol the Willow Prairie area. In the 1950s, the Forest Service built the Willow Prairie Campground adjacent to the cabin. In the early 1990s, the Forest Service built 19 miles of interconnecting horse trails in the Willow Prairie area. In 1991, the Willow Prairie Campground was converted into a horse camp and the cabin was opened to the public as a rental unit.\\"Willow Prairie Campground\\", Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest, United States Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture, 20 May 2008. The simple log structure is an excellent example of an early Forest Service wilderness crew cabin. Because of the cabin's rustic architecture and its unique historic value as an early Forest Service guard station, the Willow Prairie Cabin was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.  Structure  The Willow Prairie Cabin is located in a remote area of the Butte Falls Ranger District in the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest. It sits on the western slope of the Cascade Mountains, at about elevation. The cabin is surrounded by a mature conifer forest just southwest of Mount McLoughlin. It is adjacent to Willow Prairie meadow, a large high country wetland with several beaver ponds. The Willow Prairie Cabin is a one-room log structure with a wooden shake roof. There are two shutter-style windows without glass. Heat is provided by a wood- burning stove. The cabin's rustic furnishings include a table and chairs along with two simple sleeping cots. The cabin has built-in counter-space for preparing meals and places to hang lanterns. However, visitors must bring their own lanterns or lights as well as a portable camp stove, cookware, utensils, and bedding. The Willow Prairie Cabin has a maximum capacity is four people, and is available to rent throughout the year. The $15 per night rental fee is used to preserve and maintain the cabin.

Firewood is usually available at the site; however, visitors are encouraged to bring firewood or an alternate heating source just in case the wood bin is empty. A vault-toilet is located near the cabin. During the summer, potable water is available from a hand pump approximately 400 feet from the cabin.  Recreation  Horse camp corrals with cabin in the backgroundThere are over nineteen miles of horse trails in the forest surrounding Willow Prairie Cabin. As a result, horseback riding is the reason many visitors come to Willow Prairie. The cabin is adjacent to the Willow Prairie campground and horse camp. The campground has ten campsites each with a picnic table and fire pit along with four 12-foot by 12-foot corrals. The campground has two vault toilets. There is also potable water from a hand-pumped well plus two troughs for watering horses. To protect the Willow Prairie meadow, riders are required to stay on marked trails, and horses must be kept in a corral when not being ridden. The Forest Service provides a trailer for manure, which must be cleared from camp corrals before departure.Miller, Bill, \\"Willow Prairie Horse Camp\\", Mail Tribune, Southern Oregon Media Group, Medford, Oregon, 23 October 2008. In addition to horseback riding, visitor can enjoy camping or hunting in season. Bird watching is also a popular summer pastime. Among the bird common to Willow Prairie meadow and the surrounding forest are sandhill cranes, great blue herons, Canada geese, red-tailed hawks, and a wide variety of ducks. Deer and elk are also common near the meadow. During the winter, the area offers the opportunity for cross- country skiing, snowshoeing, and snowmobiling.  Access  Willow Prairie Cabin is located southeast of Butte Falls, Oregon and east of Medford, Oregon. It is accessible via County Road 821 (the Butte Falls-Fish Lake Highway) to Forest Service Road 3738 and Forest Road 3735.

Early career Born William Lucas to sharecroppers in Wynne, Arkansas, United States, Lucas's family was always looking for better living conditions and worked their way north to Southern Missouri, then to St. Louis in 1940 and Chicago the year after. As a youngster, he sang on the streets of Advance, Missouri, where the mostly white audience preferred hillbilly songs, but in St. Louis in 1940, he teamed up with blues singer Big Joe Williams and started singing for a black audience. Until 1946, Lucas played guitar on the streets, often at the side of Sonny Boy Williamson II. Later that year, he formed a trio with Willie Mabon and Earl Dranes, joined the Musicians Union, and enjoyed a two-week gig at the Tuxedo Lounge. For several years, he played in various blues combos and played in various clubs, bars and street settings. During this time, he played with Johnny \\"Man\\" Young, Jo Jo Williams, Homesick James, Little Hudson, Snooky Pryor, and Little Walter. In 1950, Lucas switched from guitar to piano and worked as a sideman for various blues bands, and appeared on records by Little Willy Foster, Homesick James and Snooky Pryor. In 1954, while leading the trio Lazy Bill and His Blue Rhythms, he secured a recording contract with Chance Records, who gave him one recording session. The company released one 78 rpm phonograph record ‚Äì \\"She Got Me Walkin'\\" b/w \\"I Had a Dream\\". In 1955 he headed an ensemble billed as Blues Rockers, who issued a single via Excello Records. The recording took place in Nashville, Tennessee, with Lucas on vocals and piano, P.T. Hayes playing the harmonica, Earl Dranes on guitar and Jo Jo Williams supplying guitar, bass and drums. Later career As the 1950s progressed, work became harder to find, and during the 1960s, Lucas tried to get into the folk-blues scene but could not secure any contracts. From 1964 and well into the 1970s, Lucas straddled two careers: playing in various groups led by George \\"Mojo\\" Buford and playing solo or leading his own small groups. In 1970, he played a benefit show at the Guthrie Theatre organized by Minneapolis's black establishment to show the range and history of Afro-American music. The same year Lucas appeared at the Wisconsin Delta Blues Festival, and the Ann Arbor Blues Festival, with Jeff Titon and John Schrag. In the 1970s, Titon helped record and produce Lucas's material for Philo Records. In 1979, Lucas, who had played live on the radio in the 1960s, started hosting his own regular radio show, The Lazy Bill Lucas Show on KFAI in Minneapolis.Jeff Titon, producer, Philo Records 1007, 1973 Lucas died of natural causes in Minneapolis in December 1982, at the age of 64.

It is a vast wilderness area which covers and consists of a complex of 5 large bogs separated by unregulated rivers, their floodplains, and extensive forests. The nature reserve aims to protect diverse ecosystems and rare species, mainly through preserving the natural development of forests and bogs and securing the continuing management of semi-natural floodplain grasslands. Alam-Pedja is situated in Central Estonia northeast of Lake V√µrtsj√§rv, in a lowland area called the V√µrtsj√§rv Basin. It spans over three counties - Tartu, J√µgeva and Viljandi. The area has an especially low density of human population, comparable to that of wolf, bear and lynx. The nature reserve was established in 1994. It is recognized as a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention and since 2004 it is a designated Natura 2000 site. The name Alam-Pedja, translating as Lower-Pedja, comes from the nature reserve's location on the lower reaches of the Pedja River. History Alam-Pedja Nature Reserve from air The first human inhabitants came to the area of the present nature reserve in the Stone Age. Permanent settlements were established on the shores of Lake Big V√µrtsj√§rv, predecessor of the current lake, which covered large lowland areas to the north and northeast. Fishing was the main occupation which attracted inhabitants to this area for centuries. Human activities influenced the area most in the 19th century, when interest in using its natural resources (mainly wood and fish) grew significantly. The main driver behind exploiting the large forests of the area was glass industry, which needed huge amounts of firewood. The first glass workshop was established in Utsali in 1760. In the beginning of 19th century the V√µisiku or R√µika-Meleski glass and mirror manufacture on the banks of P√µltsamaa River near the western border of the current nature reserve was the largest industrial enterprise in Estonia, employing around 540 people in 1820. After the First World War the majority of glass factories were shut down and intensive forest cutting stopped. Floodplain of the Pedja River near Kirna From 1952 to 1992 Soviet Air Force managed a relatively small bombing range in the northern part of the area. The small village of Utsali was cleared of people for that purpose. The large buffer zone of the bombing range, covering nearly half of the territory of today's nature reserve, ensured the protection of the natural landscape. The nature reserve was officially established in 1994 with the help of Estonian Fund for Nature. In 1997 it was included in the Ramsar list of wetlands of international importance and since 2004 it is part of the European Union Natura 2000 network. Currently the nature reserve has less than 10 permanent inhabitants, and no roads traverse the area. Before the Second World War, 120 people lived in Palup√µhja, a village on the left bank of Emaj√µgi; in 2001, it had five. Nature Satellite image of Alam-Pedja Alam- Pedja Nature Reserve covers large portion of the V√µrtsj√§rv Basin, a vast bowl- like lowland area, which following the last Ice Age was inundated by the waters of Lake Big V√µrtsj√§rv. When the lake formed in early Holocene the water level was 4‚Äì5 m higher than today. The lake started receding after 7500 BP, when an outflow to the east developed via the Emaj√µgi Valley. The nature reserve is largely a wetland, including a complex of five large bogs and floodplains of the large rivers (Emaj√µgi, P√µltsamaa and Pedja). Wetlands cover 82% of the nature reserve's territory. The only types of lakes found in the nature reserve are oxbow lakes and more than 2000 bog pools. Many floodplain meadows have traditionally used for haymaking. However, in recent decades the extent of floodplains mowed has greatly decreased, threatening species associated with such valuable semi-natural landscapes. Continuing management of floodplain meadows is one of the main aims of the nature reserve. Most of the forest in Alam-Pedja are also wet. Alluvial broadleaf and old-growth forests are particularly valuable. Alam-Pedja is the most important breeding area for great snipe in Estonia and the Baltic countries. The greater spotted eagle is another threatened bird species breeding in the area.

She was launched shortly before the war ended and entered service in late 1945. From 1945 to 1947 she was mainly used to return Australian Army equipment from the islands off New Guinea. She was also loaned to the Australian Shipping Board in early 1947 and transported earth moving equipment and timber between Melbourne and Tasmania. However, the Army did not need a ship with Crusader's capabilities after the war, and she was sold in 1947 to the Queensland Cement and Lime Company which operated her as a coral barge on the Brisbane River until the mid-1980s. The ship was scuttled in 1986 and became a popular dive wreck. Design and construction Crusader under construction During late 1944 and early 1945 the Australian Army suffered from a shortage of shipping, leading to delays in moving heavy equipment and small watercraft from Australia to operational areas in the South West Pacific. While several British and United States vessels were eventually made available in mid-1945, the Australian Army's chief engineer, Major General Clive Steele, chose to design and build a heavy lift ship for the Army.Mallett (2007), pp. 319‚Äì320 Steele personally designed the ship, which was intended to support amphibious operations and transport supplies. He deliberately underestimated the project's cost in order to gain approval for the ship's design and construction.James (2007), p. 65 The ship's design incorporated a number of unusual features. Crusader had a shallow draft to allow her to operate close to the shore, as well as four rudders and six engines driving six propellers to give her a high degree of manoeuvrability. While the ship required engines capable of generating a total of , the largest engines which were available in Australia at the time each generated only horsepower. Only six of these engines could be fitted into the ship, and she was considered under powered during her Army service. Her hold could carry of stores and an additional 40 vehicles could be embarked on her deck. The ship also had six cranes to move heavy equipment, as well as six bridge-like structures which were used to embark and disembark vehicles. This equipment allowed her to discharge cargo at the rate of at any one time.Gillett (1983), p. 258 Crusader had a 'box- like' appearance, and her design did not impress naval engineers.Mellor (1958), p. 479 Crusader was built by the Melbourne Harbour Trust at Williamstown Dockyard. She was the largest all-welded steel vessel to have been constructed in Australia at the time, and her final price of ¬£124,000 was considerably more than Steele's deliberate underestimate. The ship was launched on 8 August 1945 after being named by Steele's wife, and later became the largest ship to be commissioned by the Australian Army during World War II. Construction of a sister ship, to be called AV2768 Corsair, was also begun, but this ship was cancelled when the war ended.James (2007), pp. 64‚Äì65 Service history Australian Army The ship completed her sea trials in late November 1945, and subsequently entered service with the Army's No. 2 Ordnance Craft Park. In February 1946 Crusader sailed to Rabaul in New Britain and later Torokina, Bougainville. During these and later voyages she proved successful in her intended role, and returned supplies and equipment from the islands to Australia.Mallett (2007), p. 320 She also transported the bodies of 600 Australian servicemen killed during the fighting in the Solomon Islands to Port Moresby for permanent interment in the war cemetery there. Other unusual tasks undertaken by the vessel included transporting 800 native New Guineans from Aitape, Madang, Torokina and Wewak to a dispersal centre located in Rabaul and moving 44 tanks from Torokina to Sydney. alt=Black and white photo of a ship docked at a wharf. The ship's cranes are lifting a container above a truck. By January 1947 the Army no longer needed a ship with Crusaders capabilities, and she was loaned to the Australian Shipping Board. In February that year she transported a load of earth moving equipment from Melbourne to Launceston, and carried a cargo of timber back to Melbourne. She continued to be manned by an Army crew and made several further trips between Tasmania and the mainland, but in April 1947 it was reported that the ship was to be scrapped on the grounds that she was considered unseaworthy. Gil Duthie, the Federal member for Wilmot, sought to have Crusader retained in service until the shortage of shipping capable of transporting heavy loads to and from Tasmania was rectified. The Shipping Control Board rejected Duthrie's representations on the grounds that Crusader would need extensive alterations before she could be permanently used for commercial trade, and it would take at least a year to complete the necessary works. However, the Board gave a commitment to make other ships available to transport timber from Tasmania. Crusader was subsequently offered for sale, and was purchased by the Queensland Cement and Lime Company (QCL). She arrived at Brisbane on 28 September 1947 and was subsequently renamed Cementco. Queensland Cement and Lime Company QCL used Cementco as a self-propelled coral barge. The ship was converted to this role in Brisbane by the firms Evans Deakin, Evans, Anderson, Phelan & Co. Modifications included moving the wheel-house from the aft superstructure to about from the bow and extensively altering the cargo holds to carry up to of coral. After these works were completed in July 1948 The Courier-Mail reported that they had \\"made the strangest vessel on the Australian waterfront even stranger\\". Cementco's stern was later extended so that each member of her crew had their own cabin.\\"Queensland Cement and Lime Co.\\", p. 5 In her new role the ship carried coral which had been dredged from Moreton Bay by the converted Landing Ship Tank Coral (the former ) to QCL's cement factory at Darra in Brisbane.\\"Queensland Cement and Lime Co.\\", p. 4 Like the rest of QCL's small fleet, Cementco underwent a period of extensive maintenance at the Cairncross dry dock in Brisbane once every three years. During the 1974 Brisbane flood the ship's crew had to fasten Cementco to the pylons of the Story Bridge to prevent her from being carried down the Brisbane River. Cementco continued to transport coral until the mid-1980s, when QCL was acquired by the firm Holderbank and another ship was purchased to transport clinker to the company's new factory at Gladstone. She was subsequently laid up at Mary Street Wharf while attempts were made to sell her; during this period she was renamed Crusader II to avoid confusion with a new ship named Cementco. A buyer was not found, and in 1986 Cementco was sunk at Flinders Reef off Cape Moreton where she later became a popular dive wreck.

The imposter trevally is distributed through the tropical waters of Indian and west Pacific oceans, from the Gulf of Oman in the west to Japan and Australia in the east. The species is quite similar to the Malabar trevally, but can be distinguished by its gill raker count, and is identifiable from other species by having a white to pale grey tongue. It is a relatively small species, growing to a maximum recorded length of 30 cm. The imposter trevally inhabits coastal waters of the continental shelf in depths of up to 140 m, often associating with closely related carangid species. It preys on a range of small fish, crustaceans and cephalopods, but little is known of its reproductive biology. The imposter trevally is of minor importance to fisheries throughout its range, taken by hook and line, bottom trawls and several types of artisanal gear. Taxonomy and naming The imposter trevally is classified within the genus Carangoides, one of a number of groups of fish referred to as jacks and trevallies. Carangoides falls into the jack and horse mackerel family Carangidae, the Carangidae are part of the order Carangiformes. The species was first scientifically described by the Dutch ichthyologist Pieter Bleeker in 1852 based on the holotype specimen taken from western Sumatra in Indonesia. Bleeker named this new species Carangoides talamparoides, with the specific epithet having a slightly ambiguous meaning. Talam is a length measurement spanning the length of the thumb to little finger, par is Greek for 'equal' and oides translates to 'like' - possibly indicating the small size of the holotype. Bleeker's classification is still considered to be correct to this day, with some authors incorrectly reassigning the species to Caranx, and only one junior synonym has been applied; Carangoides gibber by Henry Weed Fowler. Description An anglers catch of imposter trevallyThe imposter trevally is a relatively small species, growing to a maximum known length of 30 cm, still making it small compared to many of its relatives. The overall shape of the fish is similar to most of the other species in Carangoides, having a strongly compressed almost ovate body, with the dorsal profile somewhat more convex than the ventral. This asymmetry is due to the dorsal profile of the head being strongly elevated to the nape. The dorsal fin is in two distinct sections; the first consisting of 8 spines and the second of 1 spine and 20 to 23 soft rays. The long section of the anal fin is preceded by two detached spines, while the main fin has 1 spine and 17 to 19 soft rays. The lobes of both the soft dorsal and anal fins are low, being shorter than the head length. The lateral line has a moderate anterior arch, with the curved section of the line much longer than the straight section. There are 32 to 52 scales on the lateral line, with 20 to 32 of these being weak scutes at the base of the caudal fin. The breast is devoid of scales, with this area extending to behind the pelvic fins, and often as far as the anal fin, and reaching as far up as the pectoral fin base. The jaws both have bands of small villiform teeth, with some outer teeth becoming conical at the front of the mouth. There are 27 to 31 gill rakers and 24 vertebrae in total. The imposter trevally is a silver to bluish grey dorsally, becoming silvery white below. A major distinguishing feature is the white to pale grey tongue, with this also seen in the carangid genus Uraspis although their different body shapes prevent confusion with C. talamparoides. The operculum has a small black spot on its upper margin. The soft dorsal and anal fins are dusky in colour, while the caudal fin is dusky yellow with black distal margins. Distribution and habitat The imposter trevally inhabits the tropical waters of the Indian and west Pacific Oceans. Its range extends from the Gulf of Oman through to India and Sri Lanka in the west, with a break in records from Sri Lanka to the Gulf of Thailand. In the west Pacific the imposter trevally inhabits South East Asian waters from the Gulf of Thailand to Sumatra and Borneo. It is distributed east towards the Philippines and Guam, and south to Australia. The imposter trevally inhabits coastal waters throughout its range, often found over the sandy continental shelf in the waters off North West Australia. Here it is known to form cohabit with Carangoides coeruleopinnatus and Carangoides malabaricus in waters 30 to 140 m deep. Biology and fishery Only one study has thoroughly recorded the diet of the imposter trevally, which was carried out in Albatross Bay, Australia. It was found teleost fish made up 73% of its diet, cephalopods 16% and a variety of crustaceans including brachyurans and stomatopods the remainder. It is thought that the coexisting C. coeruleopinnatus and C. malabaricus use diet partitioning to allow this cohabitation. Nothing is known of the species reproduction and growth patterns. The imposter trevally is of little importance to fisheries throughout its range, occasionally caught using hook and line, bottom trawls and various types of artisanal nets. It is often found in the bycatch of northern Australian prawn trawlers, and usually discarded.

The cartoon was titled \\"Life Begins for Andy Panda\\" upon its release. Papa Panda was voiced by Mel Blanc, Mama Panda by Sara Berner, and Andy Panda by Bernice Hansen. In Andy Panda's fourth film, Knock Knock, Walter Lantz's more famous character, Woody Woodpecker, was first introduced. Plot synopsis The story begins with the Finchell Broadcasting Station telling the news that the panda family had their first baby. All of the forest animals rush to see the new baby. All the animals are excited to see him and shout to name the cub. Mama Panda makes the decision, to name him Andy. The arrival of a skunk causes them all to run away. 6 months later, Papa Panda is talking with Andy about appreciating Mother Nature, until Andy looks under a tree with his slingshot and hits an opossum. The opossum stomps on Papa Panda's foot. After Papa opines that Mother Nature has no place to live, Andy starts to cry. While they're talking, they start to leave the forest and enter a barren area. Papa warns Andy about the savage Pygmy hunters that live in the wasteland. Andy runs away from his dad into the wasteland and Papa runs after him and lands in a trap, presumably made by the hunters. The hunters spot Andy and begin to chase him. Finchell announces their plight to the animals and they gather to form a rescue mission. Mr. Whippletree, a turtle, is the first animal to attempt to rescue Andy but he fails because a hunter had his shell. Mama Panda joins the action and fights off some pygmies. A kangaroo successfully puts Andy in his pouch but he was distracted by a pygmy while another one slapped the kangaroo's fanny with a plank. The skunk, who had six months earlier scared the animals chases the pygmies away and the animals cheer and Andy is rewarded by Papa. Andy wishes that the events would be put in a newsreel and Papa, about to spank him, instead decides to snuggle Andy. As the cartoon ends, Mr. Whippletree the turtle, is seen chasing the pygmy who took his shell. Style The animation used in this film when the pygmies were climbing out the rock was used again in Andy Panda Goes Fishing and again in 100 Pygmies and Andy Panda. The Pygmies' design changed from human-like, having yellow grass skirts and light brown skin to ape-like, having orange grass skirts and have darker skin in later cartoons. The cartoon wasn't seen in US television for a number of years due to concerns with the 1939 film's use of inappropriate stereotyping of Blacks through the pygmy's appearance, but it was seen in countries like Brazil.

In response, the Irish government instigated a ‚Ç¨64 billion bank bailout. This then led to a number of unexpected revelations about the business affairs of some banks and business people. Ultimately, added onto the deepening recession in the country, the banks bailout was the primary reason for the Irish government requiring IMF assistance and a total restructuring of the Irish Government occurred as result of this. Background During the second half of the 1995‚Äì2007 'Celtic Tiger' period of growth, the international bond borrowings of the six main Irish banks‚ÄîBank of Ireland, Allied Irish Banks, Anglo Irish Bank, Irish Life & Permanent, Irish Nationwide Building Society and Educational Building Society‚Äîgrew from less than ‚Ç¨16 billion in 2003 to approximately ‚Ç¨100 billion (well over half of Ireland's GDP) by 2007. This growth in bond funding was quite exceptional relative to the aggregate euro area and the focus of the Central Bank and most external observers was on the apparently strong capital adequacy ratios of the banks or Pillar One of the Basel framework. For example, the 2007 International Monetary Fund Article IV Consultation‚ÄîStaff Report on Ireland has a heading summarizing the position of the banking sector as \\"Banks Have Large Exposures to Property, But Big Cushions Too.\\". However, this appears to have come at the expense of a lack of emphasis on the second pillar, which relates to the supervisory process. In particular, the Basel II guidelines contain an extensive section on the importance of dealing with \\"credit concentration risk\\", i.e. banks having too much exposure to one source of risk. Inadequate and/or lax supervision of the Irish banking system had allowed excessive borrowing by the Irish Banks on the corporate and international money markets. By October 2009 it was German and French banks that were most exposed in the periphery of the eurozone, with more than 40 per cent of the foreign claims on Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Italy and Spain being French and German. In 2010 the Bank for International Settlements recorded between US$186.4 billion and $208.3 billion in total exposure to Ireland, with $57.8 billion in exposure to Irish banks. The German monetary financial institution sector was the largest investor in Irish bank bonds during the pre-crisis period and according to the Bundesbank's consolidated figures German banks had, by September 2008, the month of the bank guarantee, ‚Ç¨135 billion invested in Ireland. These figures for the exposure of German banks to \\"Irish\\" banks, however, relate almost in their entirety to their exposure to their own large subsidiaries based in Dublin's International Financial Services Centre, for example Depfa, which reportedly had an external focus and external ownership. The rising rate of foreign borrowing by local Irish banks in the years before 2008 reflected the enormous increase in their lending into the Irish property market, a lending area which since 1996 seemed to be able to provide an endless flow of profitable lending opportunities as the Irish public relentlessly bought and sold property. The total stock of mortgage loans in Ireland exploded from ‚Ç¨16 billion in the first quarter of 2003 to a peak of ‚Ç¨106 billion by the third quarter of 2008, about 60 percent of Ireland's GDP for that year. This, in turn, led to a massive increase in the price of Irish property assets. The freezing-up of the world's interbank market during the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 caused two problems for Irish banks. Firstly, with no new money available to borrow, withdrawal of deposits caused a liquidity problem. In other words, there was no cash available to honour withdrawal requests. A liquidity problem on its own is usually manageable through Central Bank funding. However, the second problem was solvency and this was much more serious. The lack of new money meant no new loans which meant no new property deals. No new property purchases both exposed the fragile cash-flows of developers and highlighted the stratospheric valuations of property. With the value of most of their assets (loans) declining in line with the property market, the liabilities (deposits) of the six Irish domestic banks were now considerably greater than their assets. Insolvency loomed and Irish banks would need major cash injections (recapitalisation) to stay open. State responses On 29 September 2008 Minister for Finance Brian Lenihan agreed to issue a broad state guarantee of Irish domestic banks under the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008 for two years, with the intention of recapitalising them to enable them to continue to lend into the Irish economy.Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008; seen 4 October 2015 Government interventions would cover liabilities existing from 30 September 2008 or at any time thereafter up to and including 29 September 2010. This guarantee was in respect of all retail and corporate deposits (to the extent not covered by existing deposit protection schemes in the State or any other jurisdiction), interbank deposits, senior unsecured debt, asset covered securities, and dated subordinated debt. On 20 October 2008, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank released their recommendations on government guarantees for bank debt which included the aim of \\"addressing the funding problems of liquidity-constrained solvent banks\\". Recapitalisation was carried out at Ireland's two largest banks, Allied Irish Bank (AIB) and Bank of Ireland (BoI), with\\" bailouts\\" (enforced loans) of ‚Ç¨3.5 billion confirmed for each bank on 11 February 2009.Brian Lenihan explains his recapitalisation plan On 15 February 2009 Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny, speaking in County Cork, asked the entire board of the Central Bank of Ireland's Financial Regulation section to resign. In late 2009 the Credit Institutions (Eligible Liabilities Guarantee) Scheme 2009 came into effect Amidst the crisis, the ruling Fianna F√°il party fell to fourth place in an opinion poll conducted by The Irish Times, placing behind Fine Gael, Labour and Sinn F√©in, putting Labour and Sinn F√©in ahead of Fianna F√°il for the first time in Irish history. On the evening of 21 November 2010, the then Taoiseach Brian Cowen confirmed that Ireland had formally requested financial support from the European Union's European Financial Stability Facility and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a request which was welcomed by the European Central Bank and EU finance ministers. In November 2011 the Credit Institutions (Eligible Liabilities Guarantee) Scheme was extended by the Fine Gael - Labour coalition government to 31 December 2012, subject to European Union approval of state aid. This scheme guarantees specific issuances of short- and long-term eligible bank liabilities, including on-demand and term deposits, senior unsecured certificates of deposit, senior unsecured commercial paper, senior unsecured bonds and notes and certain other senior unsecured debt whose maturity could range from overnight to five years. In March 2011, Central Bank Governor, Patrick Honohan described the crisis as \\"one of the most expensive banking crises in world history\\". In September 2011 he said that the banks were now financially sound. Anglo Irish Bank's irregularities Joe Higgins, MEP speaking outside Anglo Irish Bank during a protest against the bank bailout in 2010 The December 2008 hidden loans controversy within Anglo Irish Bank led to the resignations of three executives, including chief executive Se√°n FitzPatrick. A mysterious \\"Golden Circle\\" of ten businessmen are being investigated over shares they purchased in Anglo Irish Bank in 2008. Anglo Irish was nationalised on 20 January 2009, when the Irish government determined that recapitalisation would not be enough to save the bank. Since then it has emerged that Anglo Irish falsified its accounts before it was nationalised, with circular transactions between it and another bank, Permanent TSB, being uncovered.Statement on transactions with Anglo Irish Bank by Irish Life and PermanentStatement on Irish Life and Permanent transactions by the Financial Regulator Denis Casey, the chief executive of Irish Life and Permanent, the company that owns Permanent TSB, resigned in the aftermath of this revelation. Background Nationalisation Emergency legislation to nationalise Anglo Irish Bank was voted through D√°il √âireann and passed through Seanad √âireann without a vote on 20 January 2009. President Mary McAleese then signed the bill at √Åras an Uachtar√°in the following day, confirming the bank's nationalisation.  Irish Life and Permanent interference  Following a revelation that Government appointed directors in Anglo Irish Bank and the Financial Regulator were investigating a deposit of billions of euros into the institution, Irish Life and Permanent admitted on 10 February 2009 that it had provided what it called \\"exceptional support\\" to Anglo during September 2008. Irish Life and Permanent confirmed it had made the deposit following the introduction of the Government Guarantee Scheme, which was set up to provide each bank under its jurisdiction with a limited supply of credit in the event of a collapse. However this volatility in deposits in Anglo Irish Bank has been stated as one of the reasons why the Government moved to nationalise it. The Financial Regulator has stated that the transactions which took place between the two banks are \\"unacceptable\\" and the chief executive of Irish Life and Permanent, Denis Casey, has resigned his position. However, in a press release dated 13 February 2009, the Financial Regulator revealed that \\"it encouraged Irish banks to work together where necessary so as to continue to use normal inter-bank funding arrangements for liquidity purposes.\\" Irish Nationwide involvement On the evening of 17 February 2009 the Chairman of the building society Irish Nationwide, Dr Michael Walsh, resigned his position.  Resignation of the Financial Regulator  Following reports of a communication breakdown at the office of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority, the Chief Executive of the Financial Regulator Patrick Neary on 9 January 2009 announced his decision to retire as of 31 January that year. Neary's perceived weakness in dealing with Anglo Irish Bank received heavy criticism, with Green Party Senator Dan Boyle calling for a strengthening of powers within the organisation and saying that confidence in Irish financial services had been eroded by events of the previous six months. Financial observers indicated that a replacement for Neary might have to be sought in the United States or United Kingdom. Following the announcement, reports emerged which indicated that the Financial Regulator may have known of the Anglo loans for eight years prior to their revelation. Warning signs ignored and suppressed The crisis began through a failure by banks, the government, news organisations and the corporate sector to heed signs that the economy was overheating. In June 2005 The Economist mentioned Ireland on a list of countries with recent property price inflation; Ireland's price inflation of 192% in 1997‚Äì2005 was the highest on its list.\\"In come the waves\\". The Economist, 16 June 2005 In December 2005 Professor Brian Lucey felt that prices would continue at a \\"modest but still significant pace\\". Morgan Kelly, a professor of economics at University College Dublin, was particularly concerned about the real estate bubble which was reaching its climax in the summer of 2006. In an article published by the Irish Times, Kelly noted that the raise in house prices relative to income and rents is a strong indicator of their subsequent decrease, and that Ireland's house prices had risen 30% more than income since the year 2000. He then asserted that Irish real estate prices could possibly fall 40 ‚Äì 50% when the bubble burst. His second article was rejected by the Irish Independent and lingered unpublished at The Sunday Business Post until the Irish Times agreed to run it in September 2007. Kelly predicted the collapse of Irish banks, which had fuelled the rapid rise of real estate by increasingly lowering their lending standards and relying more on 3-month interbank loans than on their deposit base.Lewis, Michael, \\"When Irish Eyes Are Crying: First Iceland. Then Greece. Now Ireland, which headed for bankruptcy with its own mysterious logic. In 2000, suddenly among the richest people in Europe, the Irish decided to buy their country‚Äîfrom one another. After which their banks and government really screwed them. So where's the rage?\\", Vanity Fair, March 2011. Retrieved 2016-03-17. Kelly's prognostications caused a minor controversy but mostly went unnoticed until March 2008, when Philip Ingram, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, wrote a scathing report about the real estate bubble, focusing on the three major Irish banks most responsible for the crisis, Anglo Irish, Bank of Ireland, and AIB. Merrill Lynch had major, lucrative underwriting relationships with those banks, and a senior executive at Anglo Irish, Matt Moran, who had registered displeasure with Kelly over his articles, among others, did the same to Merrill. Merrill in turn retracted the report within hours, and fired Ingram by yearend. From May 2007 the banks' share prices on the Irish stock market declined markedly, and they had halved by May 2008. This had an inevitable effect on their capital adequacy ratios and therefore their ability to lend ever-higher amounts that were necessary to support property prices. In April 2008 Professor Cormac √ì Gr√°da noted that: \\"property prices [are] suffering a meltdown likely to last for some years\\", yet the bulk of new bank lending since 2000 was based on mortgages secured on property. On 7 May 2008 Brian Lenihan Jnr was appointed Minister for Finance. Formerly a lawyer and minister, he had no experience of finance, and opponents deplored that he would have to \\"learn on the job\\". On 14 May 2008 he remarked that: \\".. the risks that we identified in the last Budget have materialised, risks such as recent developments in the international financial markets, further appreciation of the euro against the dollar and sterling, lower international growth and domestically a sharper slowdown in housing\\". Ignoring the property bubble, he concluded that: \\".. we are well placed to absorb the housing adjustments and external 'shocks' so that our medium-term prospects will continue to be favourable. Our public finances are sound, with one of the lowest levels of debt in the euro area. Our markets are flexible allowing us to respond efficiently to adverse developments. We have a dynamic and well- educated labour force. We have a pro-business outward looking society. The tax burden on both labour and capital is low. Not many countries anywhere in the world are facing the present global economic difficulties with such advantages.\\" Recapitalisations of AIB and Bank of Ireland Protestors outside Anglo Irish Bank during protests against the bank bailout in April 2010 Having guaranteed the six main Irish banks in September 2008, the Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan announced on 21 December 2008 that he would seek to recapitalise Ireland's three main banks, Allied Irish Bank (AIB), Bank of Ireland (BoI) and Anglo Irish Bank. Under the plan the Government would take ‚Ç¨2 billion in preference shares in each of Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank and ‚Ç¨1.5 billion in preference shares in Anglo Irish Bank, giving it a 75% control of the latter. On 11 February 2009, Lenihan announced the provision of two ‚Ç¨3.5 billion bailouts to AIB and BoI as part of his government's recapitalisation scheme. The plan would also see the Minister appoint 25% of the directors at each bank, whilst the banks had agreed to provide a 30% increase in mortgages for first time buyers and a 10% increase in loans to small and medium businesses as well as to hold-off on repossessions of mortgage holders for twelve months after they fall into arrears. The salaries of senior bank executives will be frozen and they will not receive performance bonuses. However, it was found in 2013 that payrates at Irish banks increased between 2008 and 2012. Richard Bruton of the then opposition party Fine Gael, responded by calling the recapitalisation plan a \\"‚Ç¨7 billion gamble on the wrong horse\\". Bank of Ireland chief executive Brian Goggin announced his retirement in January 2009, confessing to RT√â that his bank has made bad lending decisions. Asked about his expected salary for 2009, Goggin admitted that it would be \\"less than ‚Ç¨2 million\\".BoI CEO Brian Goggin tells Christopher McKevitt of his expected reduction in wages Goggin had earned approximately ‚Ç¨3 million in the year to 31 March 2008. He was replaced as CEO by Richie Boucher whose appointment was announced on 25 February. Economic Adjustment Programme for Ireland At the end of September 2010 the 2008 guarantee covering the six bailed out banks expired. Prior to the lapsing of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008 the Credit Institutions (Eligible Liabilities Guarantee) Scheme 2009 (the \\"ELG Scheme\\") came into effect on 9 December 2009. The ELG Scheme provides for an unconditional and irrevocable State guarantee for certain eligible liabilities (including deposits over the ‚Ç¨100,000 limit of the Deposit Guarantee Scheme) of up to five years in maturity incurred by participating institutions from the date they joined the scheme until the closure of the Scheme on certain terms and conditions. The NTMA was appointed by the Minister for Finance as the ELG Scheme Operator. Just before the expiry of the guarantee, the covered banks faced a huge set of bond repayments - a result of most lenders only lending to the covered banks within the period of the original blanket guarantee - which resulted in a rapid and massive resort to ECB financing. Government ownership, and thus responsibility, for the Irish domestic bank sector reached a high under the guarantee, with Anglo Irish nationalised early in 2009, and Allied Irish Banks(AIB) nationalised at the end of the guarantee. These proved in the long run to be the two most expensive banks to recapitalise, with Anglo accounting for ‚Ç¨34.7 billion and AIB ‚Ç¨20.7 billion of the bank bailout total of ‚Ç¨62.8 billion (55% and 33% respectively). Much (‚Ç¨46.3 billion, or 74%) of the bank bailout was in fact completed by October 2010, but at the time the extent of any further recapitalisations were not known, and the nationalisations committed the government either to go on to cover whatever was needed or face the failure of the banks despite the amount already committed. By October 2010 Irish sovereign bond yields were above 7%, making further market borrowing unrealistic at a time when the government deficit was running at ‚Ç¨16.7 billion.Irish Times, 28 October 2010 Irish bond yields hit new highWritten Answers - Exchequer Deficits Tuesday, 8 November 2011 Although the government initially denied that there were any problems, and cited themselves as \\"fully funded well into 2011\\", in November 2010 the government had to seek a ‚Ç¨67.5 billion \\"bailout\\" from the EU, other European countries (via the European Financial Stability Facility fund and bilateral loans) and the IMF as part of an ‚Ç¨85 billion 'programme'. On 28 November 2010, European Commission, European Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), colloquially called the European Troika, agreed with the Irish government in a three-year financial aid programme on the condition of far-reaching austerity measures to be imposed on the Irish society in order to cut government expenditure. The agreements were signed on 16 December 2010 by the Irish government and the European Commission. The Irish State assigned ‚Ç¨17.5 billion to this 'bailout', an amount that was equal to the Total Discretionary Portfolio of the National Pensions Reserve Fund. The initial interest rates stipulated for the bailout loans were onerous, coming in at around 6% over all the lenders - although these were rapidly adjusted to well below market rates (averaging somewhere around 3% across all lenders). The severity of these initially proposed rates left a lingering shock. While it is generally assumed that EU/IMF bailout was mainly for the banks, this was not ever the intention, and not reflected in the facts. The original bailout agreement marked a portion of the loaned money for any bank recapitalisations - again, this reflects the uncertainty over whether the PCAR stress tests in early 2011 would reveal further large funding needs. However, the Irish government used none of the borrowed money for bank recapitalisation, at least directly. The close match between the amount of the EU/IMF loans (‚Ç¨67.5 billion) and the bank bailouts (‚Ç¨62.8 billion, but often cited as ‚Ç¨64.5 billion) may foster this assumption. In fact, the bank bailout was funded through a combination of NPRF cash and promissory notes - the former required no borrowing, being cash to hand, while the latter was a promise to pay at a later date, which required no immediate borrowing. While the promissory notes were recorded on the national debt - because they would eventually require payment, and were thus a liability - they did not involve any expenditure at the time. The further re-capitalisations undertaken following the Prudential Capital Assessment Review stress tests in early 2011, amounting to ‚Ç¨16.5 billion or 27% of the total bank costs, were met from a combination of Exchequer cash and National Pensions Reserve Fund cash, with the cost of the re-capitalisations defrayed by some ‚Ç¨16 billion in haircuts on junior bondholders. While the government deficit was financed by the EU/IMF loans during the period of high market rates, the Irish banks also continued to be largely locked out of debt markets, and their liquidity was provided by the ECB and Central bank of Ireland. By August 2011 total liquidity funding for the six banks by the ECB and the Irish Central Bank came to about ‚Ç¨150 billion; the largest and healthiest of the six, Bank of Ireland, then had a market capitalisation of just ‚Ç¨2.86 billion.\\"Banks borrowed more from Central Bank\\", RT√â News, 12 August 2011. In April 2012 the 99.8% state owned bank, Allied Irish Banks, had paid one and a half billion Euro to unsecured bank bondholders for which neither the bank nor the Irish state had no legal liability. On 26 February 2013 the Minister for Finance announced the closure of the ELG Scheme to all new liabilities from midnight on 28 March 2013.

Public hearings began in 2015. It was a joint committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas. It was formally established in November 2014 under the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013. It published its final report on 27 January 2016.Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis Denis O'Brien controversy Background In 2015, billionaire Denis O'Brien successfully applied for an injunction against RT√â preventing the state broadcaster from airing a report on how O'Brien was receiving, with the direct permission of former CEO of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC)--the former Anglo Irish Bank, a rate of approximately 1.25% when IBRC should have been charging 7.5%. This in turn led to outstanding sums of upwards of ‚Ç¨500 million. O'Brien then wrote to special liquidator Kieran Wallace to demand that these same favourable terms that were granted him by way of verbal agreement be continued. The Irish government later appointed Kieran Wallace to conduct an investigation into these same dealings. Wallace then cooperated with IBRC and Denis O'Brien to seek an injunction in Ireland's High Court to hide this information from the public. High court Judge Donald Binchy granted O'Brien the injunction and told the court that certain elements of the judgement would have to be redacted. The Irish media therefore could not report on details of the injunction. Catherine Murphy's involvement Catherine Murphy, TD, attempted to raise the issue in the D√°il on 27 May 2015. Se√°n Barrett ruled her contributions \\"out of order\\". Murphy attempted to raise the matter again the following day, this time with more success. Lawyers acting for O'Brien immediately forced the country's media to censor its own coverage, with some media outlets confirming they had received warnings from O'Brien's lawyers. RT√â reporter Philip Boucher-Hayes tweeted that Drivetime would play Murphy's speech; in the event, Murphy's speech was not broadcast and his tweet was later deleted. Tonight with Vincent Browne (with Browne absent and instead moderated by Ger Colleran, editor of INM's Irish Daily Star) featured Colleran reading a statement from TV3 management asserting that no discussion about Murphy's comments would be allowed following letters from O'Brien's lawyers. Foreign commentators covering these events for the international media suggested Irish democracy had been \\"wiped away at a stroke\\". IBRC Commission of Investigation In June 2015, the government announced the launch of a Commission of Investigation into IBRC's business dealings, to be headed by a High Court judge. This is to take place instead of a previously announced inquiry which was to be conducted by KPMG, IBRC's own auditors. The Commission is due to report before the end of 2015. The Commission will investigate transactions, activities and management decisions which resulted in a loss of ‚Ç¨10 million or more for the taxpayer. It will also cover \\"internal IBRC governance procedures and controls\\" and whether these \\"were fit for purpose\\", and will also examine the controversial sale of Siteserv to Denis O'Brien following a debt writedown of ‚Ç¨119 million.

It is threatened by deforestation and hunting. Taxonomy The species was previously considered a subspecies of the red-handed howler, but it is now treated as a separate species. Description Spix's red-handed howler has a similar appearance to the red- handed howler, but it has a yellowish-brown to reddish-brown back. Males weigh about 7.2 kg, females about 5.5 kg. Distribution and habitat The species is endemic to central Brazil, specifically along the southeastern Amazon River in the State of Par√°. It occurs mainly in the interfluvial land area between four rivers, Tapaj√≥s, Juruena, Xing√∫ and Irir√≠. The westernmost limit of native habitat lies on the right bank of the Tapaj√≥s River and Juruena River and stretches east to the banks of the Xing√∫ River and Irir√≠ River. This strip of land extends northward to Forte Curup√° (Gurup√°), Brazil, which is the northernmost extent of the distribution of Spix's red-handed howler and also its type locality. Spix's red-handed howler mainly inhabits lowland forests separated by dry areas as well as forests affected by seasonal flooding. Ecology The primary food source of this species is ripe and unripe fruit; it has the highest reliance on this food source of all species in this genus. A variety of species provide fruit year-round, but leaves supplement the sugars of the fruits with protein in their diets. When these food sources are limited, the howlers also supplement their diets with more mature leaves, flowers, woody plant matter, and sometimes fungi to possibly help digest the increased plant matter. Spix's red-handed howlers generally move in groups of 4-11 individuals, and have relatively small home ranges, 5-45 ha in size.  Conservation  Spix's red-handed howler is currently listed as a Vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, based on a population decrease of over 30% over the past 3 generations, mainly due to habitat loss. The main threat to the species is habitat destruction by logging as well as land conversion for cattle ranching and soy plantations. Habitat fragmentation occurs through the presence of two major highways - the Cuiab√°- Santar√©m highway runs through its range in a north-south direction and the Trans-amazonian Highway in an east-west direction. These roadways also pose the risk of fatality by vehicle collision. The habitat of the species is also heavily hunted (both commercially and for subsistence).

Bressey was Chief Engineer for Roads at the Ministry of Transport from 1921 to 1938. Between 1935 and 1938 he carried out research on road planning and motorway design in preparation for his Highway Development Survey, 1937 for Greater London published in 1938. He served as President of the Institution of Chartered Surveyors in 1938-9. Early life Bressey was born in Wanstead, Essex (now in the London Borough of Redbridge), the son of architect John Thomas Bressey and Elizabeth Bressey (n√©e Farrow). He was educated at Forest School, Walthamstow and in France and Germany before starting work in his father's practice in the City of London, becoming a partner in 1896. When his father retired, he succeeded him as surveyor to the Wanstead Urban District and continued the practice. Bressey married Margeret Francis Hill in 1902 and the couple had two sons. Later career At the start of World War I, Bressey was commissioned into the Royal Engineers and spent time in France and Flanders constructing military roads. In 1916 he became a staff officer in the army's roads directorate, eventually holding the position of Assistant Director of Roads and attaining the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel before he left the army in November 1919.Through most of the war Bressey held the rank of Temporary Lieutenant or Temporary Captain with a higher acting rank reflecting the seniority of the position he held. For his war service, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), and received the Croix de Chevalier of the French L√©gion d'honneur. When the Ministry of Transport was created in 1919, Sir Henry Maybury, Director-General of Roads, appointed Bressey as the Divisional Road Engineer for the London area. Bressey became Chief Engineer for Roads in 1921 and succeeded Maybury in 1928 (although Maybury's post was abolished and Bressey retained his existing title of Chief Engineer). In June 1924, Bressey was promoted to Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). He was appointed a Companion of the Bath (CB) in June 1930. In January 1935, Bressey was given a knighthood, and, Minister of Transport Leslie Hore-Belisha, appointed him to prepare a report on London's future road transport requirements up to the mid-1960s. Bressey spent three years consulting with experts and interested parties and investigating European plans. He was assisted by architect Sir Edwin Lutyens. The final report, The Highway Development Survey, 1937 for Greater London, was published on 16 May 1938 and proposed a series of high capacity motorways radiating outwards from the city and made recommendations for a series of circular routes around the capital. Although World War II delayed the implementation of any of Bressey's and Lutyens' recommendations, they subsequently featured in a number of post war reports such as Sir Patrick Abercrombie's County of London Plan and the Greater London Council's 1960s London Ringways scheme. Bressey retired from the Ministry of Transport following the publication of the report. In 1938, he received an honorary doctorate from London University and acted as President of the Institution of Chartered Surveyors (1938‚Äì1939). He was a member of several industry bodies including the Royal Town Planning Institute, the Royal Sanitary Institute and Chartered Institute of Transport. Bressey died at a nursing home in Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire on 14 April 1951 from a cerebral haemorrhage and arteriosclerosis.

The term ‚Äúmarginal efficiency of capital‚Äù was introduced by John Maynard Keynes in his General Theory, and defined as ‚Äúthe rate of discount which would make the present value of the series of annuities given by the returns expected from the capital asset during its life just equal its supply price‚Äù.Keynes, John Maynard; The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money (1936), p 135. The MEC is the net rate of return that is expected from the purchase of additional capital. It is calculated as the profit that a firm is expected to earn considering the cost of inputs and the depreciation of capital. It is influenced by expectations about future input costs and demand. The MEC and capital outlays are the elements that a firm takes into account when deciding about an investment project. The MEC needs to be higher than the rate of interest, r, for investment to take place. This is because the present value PV of future returns to capital needs to be higher than the cost of capital, Ck. These variables can be expressed as follows: * PV =\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\frac{R_i }{ (1 + r)^i}, where n is the number of years during which the capital will be productive, and Ri is the net return in year i; * C_k =\\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\frac{ R_i }{ (1 + MEC)^i}, where Ck is the upfront capital outlays; this equation defines the MEC. Hence, for investment to take place, it is necessary that PV > Ck; that is, MEC > r. As a consequence, an inverse relationship between the rate of interest and investment is found (i.e.: a higher rate of interest generates less investment). With the European Commission according to its data bank \\"AMECO\\" (Annual Macro-Economic Data) the marginal efficiency of capital is defined as \\"Change in GDP at constant market prices of year T per unit of gross fixed capital formation at constant prices of year T-.5 [that is, lagged by half a year].\\"Marginal Efficiency of Capital\\" in Ameco Marginal efficiency of capital as defined in the Ameco data bank of the European Commission for FRG, USA and Japan.

On June 1, 1964, the mountain was included within the Minami Alps National Park. Geography At , Mount Akaish is the 7th tallest peak in Japan and the 4th tallest peak in the Akaishi Mountains. The peak is located within the Minami Alps National Park. There is a triangulation station on the summit, with a Mountain hut located below, on its southern approach. On the eastern slope is a cirque, with the trace remnants of Japan's southernmost glacier. At the timberline are stands of Siberian dwarf pine, above which are numerous flowering alpine plants, and the habitat for the Rock Ptarmigan. Ascents The first recorded ascent of Mount Akaishi was by Haruki Nashiba and Masaaki Terasawa of the Japanese Home Ministry in 1879. They were followed in July 1881 by a government survey team, which established the triangulation station. Ascent of the mountain became popular after a road was established to its base in 1886. The first westerner to ascend the mountain was the English missionary and mountaineer, Walter Weston on August 19, 1892. In 1906, Usui Kojima of the Japan Alpine Club devoted the first issue of the club's magazine, Sangaku, to Mount Akashi, and Usui pioneered a new route up the mountain in 1909. In the summer of 1926, the 88-year-old founder of the ≈åkura zaibatsu, Okura Kihachiro, decided that he wanted to visit the highest point of his company's holdings, and climbed Mount Akaki with the assistance of 200 porters using palanquin.

The film features singer, actor and civil rights activist Paul Robeson singing the title song and adding a prologue that asks the viewers to interpret the remainder of the film against the producer's intentions. Alternately entitled \\"Africa Sings\\", the initial purpose of the film was as a pro-white supremacy short-subject documentary which serves as an advertisement for the birth of apartheid in South Africa but with a conflicting message in the voice-over. Primarily the documentary has been associated with Robeson and early Anti- Apartheid activism due to his re-editing and rewriting of the films' narration.Dyer, Richard. Heavenly Bodies, 2004, pg 100. Synopsis The advance publicity booklet on the film when it was entitled \\"Africa Sings\\", touted it as showing \\"what the white man achieved for himself\\" and \\"what he has done for he natives.\\"(Africa Looks Up publicity booklet n.d.:1;quoted by Schlooser 1970:pg.524). \\"Africa Sings\\" was one of the first documentary films from South Africa to take a look at the lives of South Africans of all races.

Paul Robeson, 1989,Berlin, Moscow, Films pg 202. Mainstream reviewers gave the documentary a tepid response; the London Daily Worker thought it was too bland to serve a staunch liberationist purpose.Duberman, Martin. Paul Robeson, 1989,Berlin, Moscow, Films pg 203. Paul Robeson's rewritten narration and singing Hired by the director Joseph Best, Robeson worked carefully to revise the film's prologue and in the final version says, \\"Every foot of Africa is now parceled out among the white races. Why has this happened? What has prompted them go there? If you listen to men like Mussolini they will tell you it is to 'civilize' -- a divine task, entrusted to the enlightened peoples to carry the torch of light and learning, and to benefit the African people... Africa was opened up by the white man for the benefit of himself -- to obtain the wealth it contained.\\" \\"Despite the then radical narration, Best was unable to find an audience for the film, so he reedited the content, carefully not showing poor whites along some of the more prosperous black townships that had been featured in the first cut. He did keep Robeson's narration but removed parts of it to seem less controversial and more mainstream.\\"Davis, Peter. In Darkest Hollywood: Exploring the Jungles of Cinema's South Africa, 1996, pgs 142-144. Robeson also sings a pro-African liberation song, \\"From African jungle, kraal and hut Where shadows fall on torrid light My song goes forth and supplicates In quest of love and right I seek that star which far or near Shows all mankind a pathway clear To do unto his brother And banish hate and fear\\"(My Song Goes Forth,publicity sheet,Ambassador Films n.d.:2;quoted by Schlooser,ibid.:255).

Ravi Career Ravi began acting in the plays put up by the young men in his village, Moorkkanikkara, in Thrissur district. He also started acting in professional drama. Radio plays were popular in those days. Thikkodiyan introduced Ravi to Aravindan, a highly acclaimed Malayalam Director, which fetched him his first role in Uttarayanam. But he didn‚Äôt get any offers to act after that, so he produced a film himself, Paadasaram, in which he was, predictably, the hero. It flopped at the box office, but the next two films he produced, Chora Chuvanna Chora and Chakara, did better. The role of Shaji in Chakara opposite Jayan established him as a villain. Among those who noticed him was director Bharathan. He cast Ravi in the role of Kunjippalu in Parankimala. The villain who spoke in the Thrissur dialect proved to be the turning point in his career. After Parankimala, as Ravi starred in many hits, including Ee Nadu, Iniyenkilum, Pathamudayam, 1921, NH 47, and Pavam Krooran. He quit acting when he was at his peak, as one of the dreaded villains of Malayalam cinema in the late 1980s. T. G. Ravi is now active again as an actor, after a break.

Details The United Nations Security Council endorsed a report by the Secretary-General stating that while UNOCI had created increased stability in C√¥te d'Ivoire, the fragile and delicate electoral process required the UN force to remain in the country as well as to complete implementation of goals set forth by the March 2007 Ouagadougou Agreement, involving disarmament and identification of the population, in order to allow free elections. Thus the resolution extended UNCOI mandate by six months to 31 July 2009. The force was reduced by a battalion, decreasing the number of UN peacekeepers from 8,115 to 7,450, as well as placing peacekeepers in fewer, but more concentrated, positions, from which sufficient troop numbers could be rapidly deployed as airborne quick- reaction detachments. While welcoming the signature on 22 December of the fourth Supplementary Agreement to the Ouagadougou Political Agreement of 2007, the Council took note of the delays in the implementation of that accord, urging the parties to make progress in order to create a secure environment for upcoming elections; disarmament and dismantling of militias; the cantonment and disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme; unification and restructuring of defence and security forces; and restoration of State authority throughout the country.

Sheet music exists for Everett Hoagland and Don Reid versions, dating to 1934 and 1939 respectively, but the provenance of the second of these, at least, is doubtful, as Reid may not even have formed an orchestra until 1944. Dubin wrote his lyrics for the song in 1939, and in the same year Tommy Dorsey's orchestra had a number one hit with it on the Billboard singles chart. Covers It was also recorded by the Glenn Miller Orchestra on November 5, 1939. Miller's version with vocalist Ray Eberle charted in 1940 for ten weeks, rising to number eight. Also in 1940, Sidney Bechet recorded one of the first jazz versions of the tune, performing it on soprano sax. Another significant version is Coleman Hawkins' from 1945.

They are used to study the fundamental properties of biological membranes in a simplified and well-controlled environment, and increasingly in bottom-up synthetic biology for the construction of artificial cells. A model bilayer can be made with either synthetic or natural lipids. The simplest model systems contain only a single pure synthetic lipid. More physiologically relevant model bilayers can be made with mixtures of several synthetic or natural lipids. There are many different types of model bilayers, each having experimental advantages and disadvantages. The first system developed was the black lipid membrane or ‚Äúpainted‚Äù bilayer, which allows simple electrical characterization of bilayers but is short-lived and can be difficult to work with. Supported bilayers are anchored to a solid substrate, increasing stability and allowing the use of characterization tools not possible in bulk solution. These advantages come at the cost of unwanted substrate interactions which can denature membrane proteins.  Black lipid membranes (BLM)  Schematic of a painted bilayer experiment. A sheet of plastic with a small hole in the center separates the two sides of the chamber. The bilayer is formed across this hole, separating the two chambers. The electrical properties of the bilayer can be measured by putting an electrode into each side of the chamber. The earliest model bilayer system developed was the ‚Äúpainted‚Äù bilayer, also known as a ‚Äúblack lipid membrane.‚Äù The term ‚Äúpainted‚Äù refers to the process by which these bilayers are made. First, a small aperture is created in a thin layer of a hydrophobic material such as Teflon. Typically the diameter of this hole is a few tens of micrometers up to hundreds of micrometers. To form a BLM, the area around the aperture is first \\"pre-painted\\" with a solution of lipids dissolved in a hydrophobic solvent by applying this solution across the aperture with a brush, syringe, or glass applicator. The solvent used must have a very high partition coefficient and must be relatively viscous to prevent immediate rupture. The most common solvent used is a mixture of decane and squalene. After allowing the aperture to dry, salt solution (aqueous phase) is added to both sides of the chamber. The aperture is then \\"painted\\" with a lipid solution (generally the same solution that was used for pre-painting). A lipid monolayer spontaneously forms at the interface between the organic and aqueous phases on either side of the lipid/solvent droplet. Because the walls of the aperture are hydrophobic the lipid/solvent solution wets this interface, thinning the droplet in the center. Once the two sides of the droplet come close enough together, the lipid monolayers fuse, rapidly excluding the small remaining volume of solution. At this point a bilayer is formed in the center of the aperture, but a significant annulus of solvent remains at the perimeter. This annulus is required to maintain stability by acting as a bridge between the ~5 nm bilayer and the 10s of micrometer thick sheet in which the aperture is made. The term ‚Äúblack‚Äù bilayer refers to the fact that they are dark in reflected light because the thickness of the membrane is only a few nanometers, so light reflecting off the back face destructively interferes with light reflecting off the front face. Indeed, this was one of the first clues that this technique produced a membrane of molecular-scale thickness. Black lipid membranes are also well suited to electrical characterization because the two chambers separated by the bilayer are both accessible, allowing simple placement of large electrodes. For this reason, electrical characterization is one of the most important methods used in conjunction with painted lipid bilayers. Simple measurements indicate when a bilayer forms and when it breaks, as an intact bilayer has a large resistance (>GŒ©) and a large capacitance (~2 ¬µF/cm2). More advanced electrical characterization has been particularly important in the study of voltage gated ion channels. Membrane proteins such as ion channels typically cannot be incorporated directly into the painted bilayer during formation because immersion in an organic solvent would denature the protein. Instead, the protein is solubilized with a detergent and added to the aqueous solution after the bilayer is formed. The detergent coating allows these proteins to spontaneously insert into the bilayer over a period of minutes. Additionally, initial experiments have been performed which combine electrophysiological and structural investigations of black lipid membranes. In another variation of the BLM technique, termed the bilayer punch, a glass pipet (inner diameter ~10-40 ¬µm) is used as the electrode on one side of the bilayer in order to isolate a small patch of membrane. This modification of the patch clamp technique enables low noise recording, even at high potentials (up to 600 mV), at the expense of additional preparation time. The main problems associated with painted bilayers are residual solvent and limited lifetime. Some researchers believe that pockets of solvent trapped between the two bilayer leaflets can disrupt normal protein function. To overcome this limitation, Montal and Mueller developed a modified deposition technique that eliminates the use of a heavy non-volatile solvent. In this method, the aperture starts out above the water surface, completely separating the two fluid chambers. On the surface of each chamber, a monolayer is formed by applying lipids in a volatile solvent such as chloroform and waiting for the solvent to evaporate. The aperture is then lowered through the air-water interface and the two monolayers from the separate chambers are folded down against each other, forming a bilayer across the aperture.M Montal and P Mueller.\\"Formation of Bimolecular Membranes from Lipid Monolayers and a Study of Their Electrical Properties.\\" Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 1972; 69 3561-3566. The stability issue has proven more difficult to solve. Typically, a black lipid membrane will survive for less than an hour, precluding long-term experiments. This lifetime can be extended by precisely structuring the supporting aperture,A Beerlink, P J Wilbrandt, E Ziegler, D Carbone, T H Metzger, and T Salditt. \\"X-ray Structure Analysis of Free-Standing Lipid Membranes Facilitated by Micromachined Apertures.\\" 'Langmuir 2008; 24 4952-4958. chemically crosslinking the lipids or gelling the surrounding solution to mechanically support the bilayer.N Malmstadt, T J Jeon, and J J Schmidt.\\"Long-Lived Planar Lipid Bilayer Membranes Anchored to an In Situ Polymerized Hydrogel.\\" Advanced Materials 2007; 20 84-89. Work is ongoing in this area and lifetimes of several hours will become feasible.  Supported lipid bilayers (SLB)  Diagram of a supported bilayer Unlike a vesicle or a cell membrane in which the lipid bilayer is rolled into an enclosed shell, a supported bilayer is a planar structure sitting on a solid support. Because of this, only the upper face of the bilayer is exposed to free solution. This layout has advantages and drawbacks related to the study of lipid bilayers. One of the greatest advantages of the supported bilayer is its stability. SLBs will remain largely intact even when subject to high flow rates or vibration and, unlike black lipid membranes, the presence of holes will not destroy the entire bilayer. Because of this stability, experiments lasting weeks and even months are possible with supported bilayers while BLM experiments are usually limited to hours. Another advantage of the supported bilayer is that, because it is on a flat hard surface, it is amenable to a number of characterization tools which would be impossible or would offer lower resolution if performed on a freely floating sample. One of the clearest examples of this advantage is the use of mechanical probing techniques which require a direct physical interaction with the sample. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been used to image lipid phase separation, formation of transmembrane nanopores followed by single protein molecule adsorption, and protein assemblyA Engel and D J Muller.\\"Observing single biomolecules at work with the atomic force microscope.\\" Nature Structural Biology 7. (2000) with sub-nm accuracy without the need for a labeling dye. More recently, AFM has also been used to directly probe the mechanical properties of single bilayers and to perform force spectroscopy on individual membrane proteins. These studies would be difficult or impossible without the use of supported bilayers since the surface of a cell or vesicle is relatively soft and would drift and fluctuate over time. Another example of a physical probe is the use of the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) to study binding kinetics at the bilayer surface.Y Ebara and Y Okahata.\\"A Kinetic Study of Concanavalin A Binding to Glycolipid Monolayers by Using a Quartz-Crystal Microbalance.\\" Journal of the American Chemical Society 1994; 116 11209-11212. Dual polarisation interferometry is a high resolution optical tool for characterising the order and disruption in lipid bilayers during interactions or phase transitions providing complementary data to QCM measurements. Many modern fluorescence microscopy techniques also require a rigidly-supported planar surface. Evanescent field methods such as total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRF) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) can offer extremely sensitive measurement of analyte binding and bilayer optical properties but can only function when the sample is supported on specialized optically functional materials. Another class of methods applicable only to supported bilayers is those based on optical interference such as fluorescence interference contrast microscopy (FLIC) and reflection interference contrast microscopy (RICM) or interferometric scattering microscopy (iSCAT). When the bilayer is supported on top of a reflective surface, variations in intensity due to destructive interference from this interface can be used to calculate with angstrom accuracy the position of fluorophores within the bilayer.J M Crane, V Kiessling, and L K Tamm.\\"Measuring lipid asymmetry in planar supported bilayers by fluorescence interference contrast microscopy.\\" Langmuir. 21. (2005) 1377‚Äì1388. Both evanescent and interference techniques offer sub-wavelength resolution in only one dimension (z, or vertical). In many cases, this resolution is all that is needed. After all, bilayers are very small only in one dimension. Laterally, a bilayer can extend for many micrometres or even millimeters. But certain phenomena like dynamic phase rearrangement do occur in bilayers on a lateral sub-micrometre lengthscale. A promising approach to studying these structures is near field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM). Like AFM, NSOM relies on the scanning of a micromachined tip to give a highly localized signal. But unlike AFM, NSOM uses an optical rather than physical interaction with the sample, potentially perturbing delicate structures to a lesser extent. Fluorescence micrograph of a supported bilayer on a substrate that has been patterned with a corral. This substrate was then sequentially exposed to two different populations of lipids (dyed red and green). Although the populations were kept largely separated there was some intermixing at the interface as seen from the color gradient. Another important capability of supported bilayers is the ability to pattern the surface to produce multiple isolated regions on the same substrate. This phenomenon was first demonstrated using scratches or metallic ‚Äúcorrals‚Äù to prevent mixing between adjacent regions while still allowing free diffusion within any one region.J T Groves, N Ulman, and S G Boxer.\\"Micropatterning fluid lipid bilayers on solid supports.\\" Science 1997; 275 651-3. Later work extended this concept by integrating microfluidics to demonstrate that stable composition gradients could be formed in bilayers, potentially allowing massively parallel studies of phase segregation, molecular binding and cellular response to artificial lipid membranes. Creative utilization of the corral concept has also allowed studies of the dynamic reorganization of membrane proteins at the synaptic interface. One of the primary limitations of supported bilayers is the possibility of unwanted interactions with the substrate. Although supported bilayers generally do not directly touch the substrate surface, they are separated by only a very thin water gap. The size and nature of this gap depends on the substrate material and lipid species but is generally about 1 nm for zwitterionic lipids supported on silica, the most common experimental system.S J Johnson, T M Bayerl, D C McDermott, G W Adam, et al.\\"Structure of an adsorbed dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine bilayer measured with specular reflection of neutrons.\\" Biophysical Journal. 59. (1991) 289-94. Because this layer is so thin there is extensive hydrodynamic coupling between the bilayer and the substrate, resulting in a lower diffusion coefficient in supported bilayers than for free bilayers of the same composition. A certain percentage of the supported bilayer will also be completely immobile, although the exact nature of and reason for these ‚Äúpinned‚Äù sites is still uncertain. For high quality liquid phase supported bilayers the immobile fraction is typically around 1-5%. To quantify the diffusion coefficient and mobile fraction, researchers studying supported bilayers will often report FRAP data. Unwanted substrate interactions are a much greater problem when incorporating integral membrane proteins, particularly those with large domains sticking out beyond the core of the bilayer. Because the gap between bilayer and substrate is so thin these proteins will often become denatured on the substrate surface and therefore lose all functionality. One approach to circumvent this problem is the use of polymer tethered bilayers. In these systems the bilayer is supported on a loose network of hydrated polymers or hydrogel which acts as a spacer and theoretically prevents denaturing substrate interactions. In practice, some percentage of the proteins will still lose mobility and functionality, probably due to interactions with the polymer/lipid anchors. Research in this area is ongoing.  Tethered bilayer lipid membranes (t-BLM)  The use of a tethered bilayer lipid membrane (t-BLM) further increases the stability of supported membranes by chemically anchoring the lipids to the solid substrate.Diagram showing formation of t-BLM. Gold can be used as a substrate because of its inert chemistry and thiolipids for covalent binding to the gold. Thiolipids are composed of lipid derivatives, extended at their polar head-groups by hydrophilic spacers which terminate in a thiol or disulphide group that forms a covalent bond with gold, forming self assembled monolayers (SAM). The limitation of the intra-membrane mobility of supported lipid bilayers can be overcome by introducing half- membrane spanning tether lipids with benzyl disulphide (DPL) and synthetic archaea analogue full membrane spanning lipids with phytanoly chains to stabilize the structure and polyethyleneglycol units as a hydrophilic spacer. Bilayer formation is achieved by exposure of the lipid coated gold substrate to outer layer lipids either in an ethanol solution or in liposomes. The advantage of this approach is that because of the hydrophilic space of around 4 nm, the interaction with the substrate is minimal and the extra space allows the introduction of protein ion channels into the bilayer. Additionally the spacer layer creates an ionic reservoir that readily enables ac electrical impedance measurement across the bilayer.  Vesicles  Diagram of lipid vesicles showing a solution of molecules (green dots) trapped in the vesicle interior. A vesicle is a lipid bilayer rolled up into a spherical shell, enclosing a small amount of water and separating it from the water outside the vesicle. Because of this fundamental similarity to the cell membrane, vesicles have been used extensively to study the properties of lipid bilayers. Another reason vesicles have been used so frequently is that they are relatively easy to make. If a sample of dehydrated lipid is exposed to water it will spontaneously form vesicles.A D Bangham and R W Horne.\\"Negative stainign of phospholipids and their structural modification by surface active agents as observed in the electron microscope.\\" Journal of Molecular Biology. 8. (1964) 660-668. These initial vesicles are typically multilamellar (many-walled) and are of a wide range of sizes from tens of nanometers to several micrometres.D D Lasic.\\"The mechanism of vesicle formation.\\" Biochemical Journal. 256. (1988) 1-11. Methods such as sonication or extrusion through a membrane are needed to break these initial vesicles into smaller, single-walled vesicles of uniform diameter known as small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs). SUVs typically have diameters between 50 and 200 nm.F Szoka and D Papahadjopoulos.\\"Comparative Properties and Methods of Preparation of Lipid Vesicles (Liposomes).\\" Annual Review of Biophysics and Bioengineering. 9. (1980) 467-508. Alternatively, rather than synthesizing vesicles it is possible to simply isolate them from cell cultures or tissue samples.W S Trimble, D M Cowan, and R H Scheller.\\"VAMP-1: a synaptic vesicle-associated integral membrane protein.\\" Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 85. (1988) 4538-4542. Vesicles are used to transport lipids, proteins and many other molecules within the cell as well as into or out of the cell. These naturally isolated vesicles are composed of a complex mixture of different lipids and proteins so, although they offer greater realism for studying specific biological phenomena, simple artificial vesicles are preferred for studies of fundamental lipid properties. Since artificial SUVs can be made in large quantities they are suitable for bulk material studies such as x-ray diffraction to determine lattice spacingD Papahadjapoulos and N Miller.\\"Phospholipid Model Membranes I. Structural characteristics of hydrated liquid crystals.\\" Biochimica et Biophysica Acta. 135. (1967) 624-638. and differential scanning calorimetry to determine phase transitions.H Trauble and D H Haynes.\\"The volume change in lipid bilayer lamellae at the crystalline- liquid crystalline phase transition.\\" Chem. Phys. Lipids. 7. (1971) 324-335. Dual polarisation interferometry can measure unilamelar and multilamelar structures and insertion into and disruption of the vesicles in a label free assay format.J Popplewell, M Swann, N Freeman, C McDonnell and R Ford, \\"Quantifying of the Effects of Mellitin on Liposomes.\\" Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (2007) 1768 13-20 Vesicles can also be labeled with fluorescent dyes to allow sensitive FRET-based fusion assays.L Guohua and R C Macdonald.\\"Lipid bilayer vesicle fusion: Intermediates captured by high-speed microfluorescence spectroscopy.\\" Biophysical Journal. 85. (2003) 1585‚Äì1599. In spite of this fluorescent labeling it is often difficult to perform detailed imaging on SUVs simply because they are so small. To combat this problem researchers have developed the giant unilamellar vesicle (GUV). GUVs are large enough (several tens of micrometres) to study with traditional fluorescence microscopy. Many of the studies of lipid rafts in artificial lipid systems have been performed with GUVs for this reason.C Dietrich, L A Bagatolli, Z N Volovyk, N L Thompson, et al.\\"Lipid rafts reconstituted in model membranes.\\" Biophysical Journal. 80. (2001) 1417‚Äì1428. Compared to supported bilayers, GUVs present a more ‚Äúnatural‚Äù environment since there is no nearby solid surface to induce defects or denature proteins. However, GUVs are relatively fragile, time consuming to make and can only be produced in limited yield compared to SUVs. To circumvent these problems a microfluidic assembly line approach to GUVs was reported.Matosevic, S.; Paegel, B. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja109137s Alternatively, SUVs and their transition into bilayer on a solid support can be visualized using interferometric scattering microscopy (iSCAT).Andrecka, J., Spillane, K. M., Ortega-Arroyo, J. & Kukura, P. Direct observation and control of supported lipid bilayer formation with interferometric scattering microscopy. ACS nano (2013) This technique also allows detecting micro- and nanodomains in a label- free manner.de Wit, G., Danial, J. S., Kukura, P. & Wallace, M. I. Dynamic label-free imaging of lipid nanodomains. PNAS (2015)  Droplet Interface Bilayers  Droplet Interface Bilayers (DIBs) are phospholipid-encased droplets that form bilayers when they are put into contact. The droplets are surrounded by oil and phospholipids are dispersed in either the water or oil. As a result, the phospholipids spontaneously form a monolayer at each of the oil-water interfaces. DIBs can be formed to create tissue-like material with the ability to form asymmetric bilayers, reconstitute proteins and protein channels or made for use in studying electrophysiology. Extended DIB networks can be formed either by employing droplet microfluidic devices or using droplet printers.  Micelles, bicelles and nanodiscs  Detergent micelles A M Seddon, P Curnow, P J Booth. \\"Membrane proteins, lipids and detergents: not just a soap opera.\\" Biochim Biophys Acta. 2004 Nov 3;1666(1-2):105-17 are another class of model membranes that are commonly used to purify and study membrane proteins, although they lack a lipid bilayer. In aqueous solutions, micelles are assemblies of amphipathic molecules with their hydrophilic heads exposed to solvent and their hydrophobic tails in the center. Micelles can solubilize membrane proteins by partially encapsulating them and shielding their hydrophobic surfaces from solvent. Bicelles are a related class of model membrane, typically made of two lipids, one of which forms a lipid bilayer while the other forms an amphipathic, micelle-like assembly shielding the bilayer center from surrounding solvent molecules. Bicelles can be thought of as a segment of bilayer encapsulated and solubilized by a micelle. Bicelles are much smaller than liposomes, and so can be used in experiments such as NMR spectroscopy where the larger vesicles are not an option. Nanodiscs consist of a segment of bilayer encapsulated by an amphipathic protein coat, rather than a lipid or detergent layer. Nanodiscs are more stable than bicelles and micelles at low concentrations, and are very well-defined in size (depending on the type of protein coat, between 10 and 20 nm). Membrane proteins incorporated into and solubilized by Nanodiscs can be studied by a wide variety of biophysical techniques.

It is a shrub with pinnate leaves that mostly have between three and seven leaflets, and deep rose pink, four-petalled flowers. It usually grows along streams in sandy soil. Description Boronia molloyae is a shrub that typically grows to a height of and has hairy branches. The leaves are pinnate with mostly between three and seven narrow elliptic leaflets long. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on a thin pedicel long and with a top- shaped tip. The four sepals are more or less round, papery, hairy and about long. The four petals are deep rose pink, broadly elliptic and about long. There are eight stamens, with the four nearest the sepals sterile and longer than those near the petals. The stigma is sessile, pyramid-shaped and about high. Flowering occurs from September to December. Taxonomy and naming In 1843, James Drummond published a description of a plant he called Boronia molloyi in the London Journal of Botany. He named it \\"after the lady of Capt. Molloy\\" (John Molloy) but did not provide a Latin diagnosis. The same species was given the name Boronia elatior by Friedrich Gottlieb Bartling in 1844 and B. semifertilis by Ferdinand von Mueller in 1861. In 1998 Paul G. Wilson used the name Boronia molloyae, an orthographic variant of Drummond's name, and chose Bartling's specimen as the lectotype. The specific epithet (molloyae) honours Georgiana Molloy. Distribution and habitat Tall boronia grows in sandy soils along watercourses and near swamps between Gingin and Albany in the Jarrah Forest, Swan Coastal Plain and Warren biogeographic regions.

Characteristics  A male Corsican red deer The Corsican red deer is smaller than most of the 16 subspecies of the red deer; it has shorter legs (possibly to better scramble up mountain sides) and a longer tail.Hughes West 2008, p 146 The antlers are also simplified and shorter, typically less than in length. The coat is brownish. Life expectancy is 13‚Äì14 years. Males reach a height of and a weight of ; while females measure and weight .Natura 2000, in French  Reproduction  This subspecies reach sexual maturity at 2 years of age. Mating lasts from August to November and can involve mortal battles. The dominant male finally secures most of the mature females, typically 12 per male. After gestation, in May‚ÄìJuly, females hide alone in the maquis (the dense vegetation) to deliver, typically a single birth per female. Males leave the matriarchal group following the reproductive period.  Distribution and habitat  The Corsican red deer is native to the Tyrrhenian islands of Corsica and Sardinia. Today, it lives in the wild in sanctuaries on both islands; for example, it is bred in the Monte Arcosu Forest in Sardinia and in the Parc Naturel R√©gional de Corse, which covers almost 40% of the island, where it was reintroduced from Sardinia after its extinction in the 1970s.  Conservation status  The subspecies gets its name from the island of Corsica from where it was, however, extirpated in the early 1970s. At that time, the less than 250 animals that still existed on Sardinia were protected and plans were elaborated for a reintroduction on Corsica. Captive breeding on the latter island began in 1985 and the population increased from 13 founders to 186 captive animals. Reintroduction could finally begin in 1998, and as of 2007, the Corsican population was about 250 individuals, with a total of about 1,000 for the subspecies, which has therefore been downgraded to near threatened on the IUCN Red List.Kidjo et al. 2007  See also  * Insular dwarfism * Sardinian dhole  Notes   References  * * Category:Elk and red deer Category:Mammals of Europe Category:Fauna of Sardinia Category:Mammals described in 1777 ","title":"Corsican red deer"},{"id":"21530611","text":", abbreviated as Sandai Jitsuroku, is an officially commissioned Japanese history text.

His Rhythm & Blues Showcase radio show made its debut on the college's WGLS-FM. He was mentored in radio by WGLS-FM program director Frank Hogan. Marshall patterned his show after Philadelphia radio personalities Harvey Holiday, Butterball, Georgie Woods, Jerry Blavat, and Hy Lit; and then contemporary hosts Doug Henderson, Jr. and Jerry Wells of WDAS-FM. He is the cousin of notable WCBS-FM radio personality Bobby Jay. The musical variety of Marshall's radio show included a mix of Soul and Motown with the contemporary sounds of the day. This was during an era when Urban Contemporary Radio stations like New York's WBLS, or Philadelphia's WUSL-FM played only new music by artists like the Gap Band, Luther Vandross, or L.L. Cool J. Oldies formats were restricted to Sunday nights. The freedom of the college radio format allowed Marshall to feature artists like The Temptations, Four Tops, Wilson Pickett, and Sly & the Family Stone alongside Cameo, Run D.M.C., Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam, and Al B Sure!. This format was soon adopted and credited to mainstream radio stations like WRKS-FM, New York, or Philly's WDAS-FM in 1988 as Urban Adult Contemporary. Marshall's Rhythm and Blues Showcase radio show was rechristened the Urban Showcase in 1989 with a special segment spotlighting Soul Classics. Soon after he reverted to his original Rhythmic Soul format and shortened the shows name to the R&B; Showcase. Marshall's focus was on introducing new R&B; acts to his listeners and reviving the careers of the legendary artists by featuring their new recordings. It would be common to hear songs like The Spinners's mid eighties singles \\"Put us Together Again,\\" or \\"I Found An Angel;\\" The Temptations \\"All I Want From You;\\" or Diana Ross's version of Jackie Ross's Selfish One. These tracks went virtually unnoticed on conventional radio stations. In addition to the recording artists, Marshall also interviewed producers, songwriters and record label executives who would share insight on the music industry, their careers and current projects in an educational style forum.  Commercial radio career In the late 1980s Marshall was hired as a producer and music programmer at 610 WIP in Philadelphia. This was prior to the station adopting its Sports Radio format. For a short time he was the voice of WNAP Norristown, Pennsylvania's \\"Gospel Highway Eleven.\\" Marshall continued with the Gospel format during the summer of 1988 at WTMR 800 AM, Camden, New Jersey. The station broadcast religious music to the Philadelphia area. Marshall continued to host the R&B; Showcase on WGLS in Glassboro until graduation in 1991. During the summer of the same year, Marshall was recruited by Program Director Sab Capelli to join the on- air staff at Atlantic City's \\"Best Mix Music Station\\" WAYV. The Jersey shore radio station at that time was located just outside the \\"Days Inn on the boardwalk near the Tropicana Hotel & Casino. Marshall remained for nearly two years hosting a Top 40 show nights and weekends. In 1995 Tim Marshall joined the on-air staff of WBZC-FM where his R&B; Showcase radio show has been a mainstay.  Concert promotions and charitable events Since the early 1990s, Marshall has served as a promoter and chairperson for a host of charitable concerts and events including; the Linda Creed Breast Cancer Foundation, Bill Deal Cystic Fibrosis Fund, the Damon Harris Prostate Cancer Foundation, and Hold on to Education Foundation inc. He has hosted concerts and emceed shows at venues like the Investors Bank Performing Arts Center, Radisson Hotels, Clarion Hotels, and Patriots Theater at the Trenton War Memorial Auditorium in South Jersey; and various red carpet events outside the Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts, and the Doubletree Hotel on the Avenue of the Arts, Philadelphia. On September 7, 2009 he hosted the annual Willingboro Jazz Festival at Millcreek Park in Willingboro Township, New Jersey with special guest Spyro Gyra, Marilyn Marshall, Stephen Tirpak, the Blue Method and Cintron. He has also presented or hosted concerts by The Temptations' former vocalists Richard Street, and Damon Harris; G.C. Cameron of The Spinners; The Temptations Review featuring Dennis Edwards; The Delfonics, The Intruders; Braille (Bryan Winchester); Bluesman Mikey Junior; MTV's Making the Band vocal group LMNT; Gil Saunders of Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes; and the first full-length concert by American Idol (Season 1)'s Justin Guarini. In 2014 Marshall hosted the Golden Decade of Disco Diva's Live Concert at the historic Grand Opera House (Wilmington, Delaware) featuring Evelyn Champagne King; The Three Degrees, and Grammy-Award-winning arranger Bobby Eli's Groove Yard Band.  Stage productions Marshall has acted in various stage plays for Hollywood East Productions in Philadelphia, and Stageworks Touring Company based in South Jersey. His roles include the male lead in Lorraine Hansberry's To Be Young, Gifted and Black, and A Raisin in the Sun where he recreated Sidney Poitier's role of Walter Lee Younger. He portrayed Sheriff Will Masters in William Inge's Bus Stop (play) and the Bartender in Jimmie \\"Mr. Hollywood\\" Brooks \\"Living In the Fast Lane.\\" His stage appearances also include performances at Fort Dix Officer's Club in New Hanover Township, NJ, and McGuire Air Force Base in Burlington County, New Jersey.  Awards On May 11, 2002, Marshall was presented an Award of Merit by the members of the Toronto City Council in Canada in congratulations for his charitable works for various non-profit organizations. He was also honored with a Proclamation from Mayor Eddie Campbell Jr. of Willingboro Township, New Jersey; State Senator Diane Allen with a New Jersey Senate resolution; and an Image Award from the Delaware Valley Chapter of the NAACP. On May 18, 2013 Marshall and his radio show co-host Larry Cotton were honored with a New Jersey State Senate Proclamation for their charitable works at a Benefit Gala for Hold On To Education Foundation.

German occupation  Holocaust in Reichskommissariat Ostland (which included Latvia): a map Fire damage in Daugavpils, July 1941 The German army crossed the Soviet frontier early morning on Sunday, 22 June 1941, on a broad front from the Baltic Sea to Hungary. The Germans advanced through Lithuania towards Daugavpils and other strategic points in Latvia. The Nazi police state included an organisation called the Security Service (German: Sicherheitsdienst), generally referred to as the SD, and its headquarters in Berlin was known as the National (or Reich) Security Main Office (Reichssicherheitshauptamt), known by its initials RSHA.Ezergailis, The Holocaust in Latvia, at page 245.  The SD in Latvia  In advance of the invasion, the SD had organised four \\"Special Assignment Units\\", which have become known by their German name of Einsatzgruppen. The name of these units was a euphemism, as their real purpose was to kill large numbers of people whom the Nazis regarded as \\"undesirable\\". These included Communists, Gypsies, the mentally ill, and, especially, Jews. The Einsatzgruppen followed closely behind the German invasion forces and established a presence in Latvia within days, and sometimes hours, of the occupation of a given area of the country by the German Wehrmacht. The SD in Latvia can be distinguished in photographs and descriptions by their uniforms. The full black of the Nazi SS was seldom worn; instead, the usual attire was the grey Wehrmacht uniform with black accents. They wore the SD patch on the left sleeve, a yellowish shirt, and the Death's Head (Totenkopf) symbol on their caps. The SD ranks were identical to the SS. The SD did not wear the SS lightning rune symbol on their right collar tabs but replaced it with either the Totenkopf or the letters \\"SD\\". The SD first established its power in Latvia through Einsatzgruppe A, which was subdivided into units called Einsatzkommandos 1a, 1b, 2 and 3. As the front line moved further east, Einsatzgruppe A moved out of Latvia, remaining in the country only a few weeks, after which its functions were taken over by the \\"resident\\" SD, under the authority of the Kommandant der Sicherheitspolizei un SD, generally referred to by the German initials of KdS. The KdS took orders both from RSHA in Berlin and from another official called the Befehlshaber (commander) der Sicherheitspolizei und des SD, or BdS. Both the KdS and the BdS were subordinate to another official called the Ranking (or Higher) SS and Police Commander (H√∂herer SS-und Polizeif√ºhrer), or HPSSF. The lines of authority were overlapping and ambiguous.Ezergailis, The Holocaust in Latvia, at page 253 The eastern part of Latvia, including Daugavpils and the Latgale region, was assigned to Einsatzkommandos 1b (EK 1b) and 3 (EK 3). EK 1b had about 50 to 60 men and was commanded by Erich Ehrlinger.  Murders commence with Nazi invasion  Members of a Latvian self-defence unit assemble a group of Jewish women for execution on a beach near LiepƒÅja, 15 December 1941. In Latvia, the Holocaust started on the night of 23 to 24 June 1941, when in the Grobi≈Üa cemetery an SD detachment killed six local Jews, including the town chemist.Ezergailis, The Holocaust in Latvia, at page 211 On the following days 35 Jews were exterminated in Durbe, Priekule and Asƒ´te. On June 29 the Nazi invaders started forming the first Latvian SD auxiliary unit in Jelgava. MƒÅrti≈Ü≈° VagulƒÅns, member of the Pƒìrkonkrusts organisation, was chosen to head it. In the summer of 1941, 300 men in the unit took part in the extermination of about 2000 Jews in Jelgava and other places in Zemgale. The killing was supervised by the officers of the German SD Rudolf Batz and Alfred Becu, who involved the SS people of the Einsatzgruppe in the action. The main Jelgava Synagogue was burnt down through their joint effort. After the invasion of Riga, Walter Stahlecker, assisted by the members of Pƒìrkonkrusts and other local collaborationists, organised the pogrom of Jews in the capital of Latvia. Viktors ArƒÅjs, aged 31 at the time, a possible former member of Pƒìrkonkrusts and a member of a student fraternity, was appointed direct executor of the action. He was an idle eternal student who was supported by his wife, a rich shop owner, who was ten years older than he was. ArƒÅjs had worked in the Latvian Police for a certain period of time. He stood out with his power-hungry and extreme thinking. The man was well fed, well dressed, and \\"with his student's hat proudly cocked on one ear\\".  Arajs Kommando formed  On 2 July Viktors ArƒÅjs started to form his armed unit of men who were responding to the appeal of Pƒìrkonkrusts to take arms and to clear Latvia of Jews and communists. In the beginning, the unit mainly included members of different student fraternities. In 1941 altogether about 300 men had applied. The closest assistants of Viktors ArƒÅjs included Konstantƒ´ns Kaƒ∑is, Alfrƒìds Dikmanis, Boris Kinsler and Herberts Cukurs. On the night of July 3, ArƒÅjs Kommando started arresting, beating and robbing the Riga Jews. On 4 July, the choral synagogue at Gogoƒºa Street was burnt, and thereafter, the synagogues at Maskavas and Stabu Streets. Many Jews were killed during those days, including the refugees from Lithuania. In carts and blue buses, the men of Arajs Kommando went to different places in Courland, Zemgale and Vidzeme, killing thousands of Jews there. \\"Two Worlds\\": An anti-communist and anti-semitic propaganda board, Latvia, Summer, 1941. These killings were supposed to serve as an example to other anti-Semitic supporters of the Nazi invaders. Individual Latvian Selbstschutz units were also involved in the extermination of Jews. In the district of Il≈´kste, for instance, Jews were killed by the Selbstschutz death unit of commander Oskars Baltmanis, which consisted of 20 cold-blooded murderers. All killings were supervised by the officers of the German SS and SD. In July 1941, the mass killing of Riga Jews took place in the Biƒ∑ernieku Forest. About 4,000 people died there. The executions were headed by Sturmbannf√ºhrers (majors) H. Barth, R. Batz, and the newly appointed chief of the Riga SD Rudolf Lange. Members of Latvian Auxiliary Police assemble a group of Jews, LiepƒÅja, July, 1941.  Massacres  As stated by the Latvian historian Andrievs Ezergailis, this was the beginning of \\"the greatest criminal act in the history of Latvia\\". From July 1941 the Jews of Latvia were also humiliated in different ways and deprived of the rights that were enjoyed by the other citizens of Latvia. Jews were strictly forbidden to leave their homes in the evening, at night and in the morning. They were allotted lower food rations, they could only shop in some special stores, and they had to wear the mark of recognition ‚Äì the yellow Star of David on their clothes. It was forbidden for them to attend places where public events took place, including cinemas, athletic fields and parks. They were not allowed to use trains and trams, to go to bath-houses, use pavements, attend libraries and museums or to go to schools, and they had to hand over bicycles and radios. Jewish doctors were only allowed to advise and treat Jews, and they were forbidden to run pharmacies. Maximum norms for furniture, clothes and linen were also soon introduced for Jews. All articles above the norm were subject to confiscation for the needs of the Reich. All jewelry, securities, gold and silver coins had to be surrendered on demand. Anti-Semitism thus became the source of enrichment of Nazi officials and their local collaborators who confiscated Jewish property. The extermination of Jews suited the purposes of these Nazis since nobody would remain alive to demand the return of stolen items.  LiepƒÅja  In LiepƒÅja the first mass killing of Jews took place on July 3 and 4, when about 400 people were shot dead, and on July 8 when 300 Jews were killed. The German group of SD and policemen did the shooting, while the members of Latvian Selbstschutz convoyed victims to the killing site. On July 13, the destroying of the sizeable choral synagogue of LiepƒÅja began. The Scripture rolls were spread on the Ugunsdzƒìsƒìju Square, and the Jews were forced to march across their sacred things, with watchers merrily laughing at the amusing scene. The above operations took place under the direct leadership of Erhard Grauel, commander of the Einsatzgruppe's Sonderkommando.  Ventspils  After that, Grauel went to Ventspils. The killings were jointly carried out by German Ordnungspolizei and the men of the local Selbstschutz. On July 16-July 18, 300 people were shot dead in the Kazi≈Üu Forest. In July‚ÄìAugust, the remaining 700 Jews from town were shot dead, while the Jews of the region were killed in the autumn. The shooting was carried out by German, Latvian and Estonian SD men who had arrived by ship. Soon a poster appeared on the Kuldƒ´ga-Ventspils highway, which said that Ventspils was Judenfrei (free of Jews).  Daugavpils  In Daugavpils the extermination of Jews was initially commanded by Erich Ehrlinger, chief of Einsatzkommando 1b. By July 11 they had killed about 1,150 people. Ehrlinger's work was continued by Joachim Hamann, who was liable for the killing of 9012 Jews in the city and in southern Latgale. The chief of the local auxiliary police Roberts Bl≈´zmanis had rendered active assistance by ensuring the moving of the Jews to the Grƒ´va ghetto and transporting them to the killing places.  Rƒìzekne  In Rƒìzekne killings were carried out by a German SD group, which was helped by Selbstschutz men and Arajs Kommando. About 2,500 people were exterminated. By October 1941, altogether about 35,000 Latvian Jews were killed. There are two known instances of people rescuing Jews in Rƒìzekne ‚Äì Old Believer Ulita Varushkyna who at the plea of his parents took in their two- year-old son Mordechai Tager that she later adopted, and the Polish Matusevich family that hid Haim Israelit and his nephew Yakov for three years. Both Varushkyna and the Matusevich family have been awarded the title Righteous Among the Nations for their actions.  VarakƒºƒÅni  VarakƒºƒÅni, a relatively small town, had about 540 remaining Jews when the Germans gained control. They were shot into graves they were forced to dig on August 4, 1941. The fate of this small town is similar to many other towns, documented by JewishGen and others. Jungfernhof concentration camp  Confinement   Riga Ghetto  Hinrich Lohse in the Riga Central Railway Station. The Jews with Yellow badges, Riga, 1942. Riga ghetto, 1942 Jewish prisoners in Salaspils concentration camp An Anti-partisan operation, March 1943. On July 27, 1941, State Commissar (Reichskommissar) Hinrich Lohse (earlier Gauleiter of Schleswig-Holstein), ruler of the Baltic lands and Belarus or Ostland as the territory was called by the invaders ‚Äì made his guidelines on Jewish question public. Jews, in his opinion, had to be used as a cheap labour force by paying them minimum wages or by providing them with a minimum food ration ‚Äì with whatever may be left over after supplying the indigenous Aryan population. In order to govern the Jews they had to be moved to special areas where ghettos would be arranged and they would be forbidden to leave the area. Walter Stahlecker protested against the idea of Hinrich Lohse and demanded that the extermination of the Jews be continued. Berlin, however, passed the power to the civil administration of occupation force and it did things its own way. The area of the Latgale suburbs in Riga was chosen for the Riga Ghetto. It was mainly inhabited by poor people: Jews, Russians and Belarusians. The ghetto bordered on Maskavas, Vitebskas, Ebreju (Jewish), Lƒ´ksnas, Lauvas, Lazdonas, LielƒÅ Kalnu, Katoƒºu, Jƒìkabpils and LƒÅƒçplƒì≈°a Streets. About 7,000 non-Jews were moved from there to other flats in Riga. More than 23,000 Riga Jews were ordered to move to the territory of the ghetto. There now were more than 29,000 inmates in the ghetto, including those who had already previously resided there. The Jewish Council was formed within the ghetto, which was assigned the task of regulating social life. The Jewish police force for the maintenance of order formed there. It consisted of 80 men armed with sticks and rubber truncheons. The ghetto was enclosed by a barbed-wire fence. Wooden barriers (logs) were placed on the main streets at the entrance, and the Latvian police were stationed as guards there. Jews were allowed to leave the ghetto only in work columns and in the accompaniment of guards. Individual Jewish specialists could come and go by displaying a special yellow ID. Leaving independently was severely punished. In the ghetto, the Jews were very crowded: 3-4 square metres were allotted per person. There was also high poverty, as food rations were given only to those who worked, i.e. to about half of the ghetto inmates. They had to maintain their 5,652 children and 8,300 elderly and disabled people. The ghetto only had 16 groceries, a pharmacy and a laundry, and a hospital was arranged, which was headed by Professor Vladimir Mintz, a surgeon. The Council of the ghetto was situated in the former Jewish school building at 141 LƒÅƒçplƒì≈°a Street. The historian Marƒ£ers Vestermanis writes: \\"The members of the Jewish Council, including the lawyers D. Elyashev, M. Mintz and Iliya Yevelson, and their volunteer assistants did all they could to somehow relieve general suffering.\\" Vestermanis M. Juden in Riga. Ein historischer Wegweiser. Bremen, 1996, S. 29. Jewish policemen, too, tried to somehow protect their fellowmen. The inmates strived to preserve themselves, and there was even an illusion of survival. A resistance group was formed that bought weapons.Latvia's Jewish Community: History, Tragedy, Revival  Daugavpils ghetto  The Daugavpils Ghetto was set up in Grƒ´va at the end of July, 1941, when all surviving Jews in the city were moved there. Jews from other towns and villages of Latgale and even Vidzeme were also brought there. Altogether the ghetto had about 15,000 prisoners. The engineer Misha Movshenson ran the Council of the ghetto. His father had headed the city of Daugavpils in 1918 during the previous period of German occupation.  Gypsy Holocaust in Latvia  Less is known about the Holocaust of the Romani people (called \\"Gypsy\\" in English and Ziguener in German) than for other groups.Niewyk, The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust, at 47. Most of the available information about the persecution of the Gypsies in Nazi-occupied eastern Europe comes from Latvia.Lewy, The Nazi Persecution of the Gypsies, at page 123. According to Latvia's 1935 census, 3,839 Gypsies lived in the country, the largest population of any of the Baltic States. Many of them did not travel about the country, but lived settled, or \\"sedentary\\" lives. On December 4, 1941, Hinrich Lohse issued a decree which stated: Although Lohse's name was on the order, it was actually issued at the behest of Bruno Jedicke,Some sources give the name Georg Jedicke. the Ordnungspolizei chief in the Baltic States. Jedicke in turn was subordinate to Friedrich Jeckeln, the senior SS man in the Baltic States and Belarus.Lewy, The Nazi Persecution of the Gypsies, at page 124. Gypsies were also forbidden to live along the coast. Historian Lewy believes this restriction may have occasioned the first large killing of Gypsies in Latvia. On December 5, 1941, the Latvian police in LiepƒÅja arrested 103 Gypsies (24 men, 31 women, and 48 children). Of these people, the Latvian police turned over 100 to the custody of the German police chief Fritz Dietrich \\"for follow up\\" (zu weiteren Veranlassung), a Nazi euphemism for murder. On December 5, 1941, all 100 were all killed near Frauenburg. On January 12, 1942, Jedicke distributed Lohse's order of December 4, 1941, ordering his subordinates that in all cases, they were to make sure to implement the necessary \\"follow up.\\" By May 18, 1942 the German police and SS commander in LiepƒÅja indicated in a log that over a previous unspecified period, 174 Gypsies had been killed by shooting. The German policy on Gypsies varied. In general, it seemed that wandering or \\"itinerate\\" Gypsies (vagabundierende Zigeuner) were targeted, as opposed to the non-wandering, or \\"sedentary\\" population. Thus, on May 21, 1942, the SS commander in LiepƒÅja police and SS commander recorded the execution of 16 itinerate Gypsies from the Hasenputh district. The documentation, however, does not always distinguish between different Gypsy groups, thus on April 24, 1942, EK A reported having killed 1,272 people, including 71 Gypsies, with no further description. In addition, the Nazi policy shifted back and forth as to how the Gypsies were to be treated, and the treatment of any particular group of Gypsies did not necessarily reflect what might appear to have been the official policy of the moment.Lewy, The Nazi Persecution of the Gypsies, at pages 125 to 126. Like the Jews, the killing of the Gypsies proceeded through Latvia's smaller towns, and with the aid of Latvians. The Arajs Kommando was reported to have killed many Gypsies between July and September 1941. In April 1942, 50 Gypsies, mostly women and small children, were assembled at the jail in Valmiera, then taken out and shot. Other massacres were reported at Bauska and Tukums. It is not known how many of Latvia's Gypsies were killed by the Nazis and their Latvian collaborators. Professor Ezergailis estimated that one-half of the Gypsy population was killed, but there will probably never be a more definite number.Ezergailis, The Holocaust in Latvia, at page 100, n.5  Justice  SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer Hans-Adolf Pr√ºtzmann. Some of the Rumbula murderers were captured after the fact. * Hinrich Lohse was a member of a Nazi class that \\"was to receive surprisingly light treatment\\" at the Nuremberg trials.Bloxham, Genocide on Trial, at page 198 In Lohse's case, apparently because the British authorities believed him to have been innocent of the Nazi crimes in the Baltic states, he was handed over to a West German \\"denazification\\" court. Sentenced to the maximum of 10 years, Lohse was released early in 1951 \\"on the familiar grounds of ill health.\\"[Died 1964] * Viktors ArƒÅjs was charged in a British court with war crimes, but was released in 1948, and afterwards hid out in West Germany for many years; although he was still a wanted war criminal, he found work as a driver for a British military unit in the western occupation zone.Bloxham, Genocide on Trial, at pages 197-199 Eventually ArƒÅjs was caught, and, in 1979, tried and convicted of murder in a West German court.Schneider, Unfinished RoadFleming, Hitler and the Final Solution, at 93n: \\"After 199 days of court proceedings, on 21 December 1979, the Hamburg assize court condemned the former SS- Sturmbahnf√ºhrer of the Latvian Legion and former Police Major Viktors ArƒÅjs to a life term in prison. ArƒÅjs had been living in an underground existence in Frankfurt for twenty-five years after the war under a false name and was arrested in 1975.\\"Died 1988 * Friedrich Jahnke, a Nazi policeman who had been instrumental in setting up the Riga Ghetto and organizing the march out to the pits, was likewise apprehended and tried in West Germany in the 1970s.Ezergailis, The Holocaust in Latvia, at pages 16 and 245-248 * Herberts Cukurs escaped to South America, where he was later murdered. It is said that he was assassinated by Mossad agents, who attracted him from Brazil to Uruguay under a fake intention of starting an aviation business,Kuenzle, Anton and Shimron, Gad, The Execution of the Hangman of Riga: The Only Execution of a Nazi War Criminal by the Mossad, Valentine Mitchell, London 2004 after it was found out that he would not stand trial for his alleged participation in the Holocaust. * Eduard Strauch, SS Lieutenant Colonel, commanded a subunit of the Rumbula killers called \\"Einsatzkommando 2.\\".Einsatzgruppen judgment, at 563-567 Despite an effort to sham mental illness, he was convicted by the Nuremberg Military Tribunal in the Einsatzgruppen trial for having a key role in the Rumbula and a number of other mass murders in Eastern Europe. On April 9, 1948, Presiding judge Michael Musmanno pronounced the tribunal's sentence on Strauch: \\"Defendant EDUARD STRAUCH, on the counts of the indictment on which you have been convicted, the Tribunal sentences you to death by hanging.\\"Einsatzgruppen judgment, at 589 Unlike his co-defendants Otto Ohlendorf and Paul Blobel, Strauch did not hang. Instead, he was handed over to authorities in Belgium, where he had committed other crimes, for trial. He died in Belgian custody on September 11, 1955.Eduard Strauch, biography and photo at Olokaustos.org * Friedrich Jeckeln came into Soviet custody after the war. He was interrogated, tried, convicted and hanged in Riga on February 3, 1946. Against popular misconception, the execution did not happen in the territory of the former Riga ghetto, but in Victory Square (Uzvaras laukums).Edelheit, History of the Holocaust, at page 340: Jeckeln was \\" ... responsible for the murder of Jews and Communist Party officials ... convicted and hanged in the former ghetto of Riga on February 3, 1946. *Fritz Dietrich (Nazi) was tried in the Dachau Trials and hanged in 1948 for killing POWS  Historiography and memorials   Soviet period  During the Second World War, the Soviet Union again occupied Latvia, this time from 1944 to 1991. It did not suit Soviet purposes to memorialize the Rumbula site or to acknowledge that the victims were Jewish. Until 1960 nothing was done to preserve or memorialize the killing grounds. In 1961 young Jews from Riga searched for the site and found charred bones and other evidence of the murders. In 1962 the Soviets staged an officially sanctioned memorial service at Bikernieki (another murder site) which made no mention of the Jews but spoke only of \\"Nazi victims\\". In 1963 groups of young Jews from Riga came out to Rumbula weekly and cleaned up and restored the site using shovels, wheelbarrows and other hand tools.http://www.rumbula.org/quesans.shtml Rumbula.org: Statement of Michael Genchik The site has been marked by a series of makeshift memorials over the years. Throughout the Soviet domination of Latvia the Soviets refused to allow any memorial which would specifically identify the victims as Jews. The Soviet Union suppressed research into and memorials of the Holocaust in Latvia until 1991, when Soviet rule over Latvia ended.Ezergailis, in World Reacts to the Holocaust, at 354-88, provides a comprehensive guide to the Soviet historiographical treatment of the Holocaust in Latvia. In one case a memorial at Rumbula of which the authorities did not approve was simply hauled away in the middle of the night, with no explanation given. Occasional references were made to the Holocaust in literature during the Soviet era. A folkloric figure called \\"≈æƒ´du ≈°ƒÅvƒìjs\\" (Jew shooter) turned up in stories on occasion. The poet OjƒÅrs VƒÅcietis often referred to the Holocaust in his work, including in particular his well-regarded poem \\"Rumbula\\", written in the early 1960s.Ezergailis, in World Reacts to the Holocaust, at 373-374 One notable survivor of the Latvian Holocaust was Michael Genchik, who escaped from Latvia and joined the Red Army, where he served for 30 years. His family was killed at Rumbula. Many years later he recalled: > In later years the officials held memorial services every year in November > or December. There were speeches reminding of the atrocities of the Nazis. > But saying kaddish was forbidden. Once after the official part of the > meeting, Jews tried to say Kaddish and tell a little about the ghetto, but > the police didn't permit to do so. Until 1972, when I retired from the army, > I did my best to keep the place neat.  Independent Latvia  In Latvia, Holocaust scholarship could only be resumed once Soviet rule had ended.According to the Latvia Institute (an agency of the Republic of Latvia): \\"There was no Holocaust research during Soviet rule in Latvia (1944‚Äì91). The victims of the Holocaust were subsumed under the rubric 'Nazi murder of peaceful Soviet citizens,' usually with unsubstantiated and highly inflated numbers. Research in the West was mainly based on accounts of survivors and court cases against Nazi criminals. Only after regaining independence in 1991, could Latvian historians begin to assess the situation and make use of documentation available locally.\\" Much of the post-1991 work was devoted to identification of the victims. This was complicated by the passage of time and the loss of some records and the concealment of others by the NKVD and its successor agencies of the Soviet secret police.Anders and Dubrovskis On November 29, 2002, sixty-one years after the murders, the highest officials of the Republic of Latvia, together with representatives of the Latvian Jewish community, foreign ambassadors, and others attended a memorial dedication at the Rumbula site. The President and the Prime Minister of the Republic walked to the forest from where the Riga ghetto had been. Once they arrived, President Vaira Vƒ´ƒ∑e-Freiberga addressed the gathering:  See also  * Segodnya (Riga) * Sonderaktion 1005 * KonrƒÅds Kalƒìjs  Notes   References   Historiographical  * Anders, Edward, and Dubrovskis, Juris, \\"Who Died in the Holocaust?

It revolves around five brothers coming to terms with the disappearance of their father.New Novel Coming from 'Book Thief' Author Markus Zusak Bridge of Clay was released in the United States and Australia on 9 October 2018, and in the United Kingdom on 11 October 2018. Plot The Dunbar boys live in a suburb of Sydney, in a house of mayhem and madness that only five young boys can cause. Left to their own devices after their mother, Penny Dunbar, died of cancer, and their father, Michael Dunbar, ran out on them, the boys do their best to get along through life. The novel starts with their father, referred to as 'the murderer', coming back into their lives requesting their help to build a bridge. All of the brothers refuse, except Clay ‚Äì who betrays his family in this act. Clay leaves school to go help his father, but before leaving Sydney meets up with their neighbour Carey Novac at the Surrounds, an old abandoned horse stables, as they do every Saturday night. The two talk about the previous horseraces of the week and obsess over The Quarryman, a book about Michelangelo. Clay leaves Carey with the book, and she says he has to come back for it. Meanwhile, several years and decades prior, a young Penny sits at the piano with her father Waldek, who hits her hands with a twig every time she gets a note wrong. Growing up in the Eastern Bloc, Waldek wants a bigger life for his daughter ‚Äì he mentors her at the piano and reads her The Illiad and The Odyssey. Proficient at the piano, Penny plays many concerts all over the Eastern Bloc, and Waldek decides that at the age of 18, she will play a concert in Vienna and never return. She is in a camp for nine months before Australia accepts her for entry. Once in Sydney, Penny works as a cleaner and an English as a Second Language teacher, but still misses her father and the piano. Eventually, she decides to gather up her savings and buy a piano, which instead of being delivered to her address, is delivered to Michael Dunbar, who lives further down on the same street. Michael, broken after the divorce from his wife Abbey, finds beauty in the world again through Penny. They get married and live happily in their house with their five sons until Penny gets cancer. Death creeps in, and at the end of her life Clay, not Michael, is the one to spend her final moments with her, outside in the garden underneath the clothesline. Work on the bridge goes slow, and as the months and the work drags on, Clay returns several times to Sydney to see his brothers, and Carey, whose jockey career is coming along smoothly. She races several times, and always goes to the Surrounds every Saturday night. Carey wins most of her races, and eventually gets put up for a Group One race. The night before, she meets Clay at the Surrounds, and they sleep together. Carey wins the race, gets injured, and dies the next day. Overcome by grief, Clay blames himself for Carey's death and decides he must finish the bridge. Eventually the bridge is finished, and Clay disappears across the world for many years until he returns for Matthew's wedding. In the end all the brothers are together, at home.

Making of The Bridge of Clay Writing process In an interview with The Guardian in 2008, Zusak made the following comments: In March 2016, Zusak talked about his unfinished novel Bridge of Clay. He stated that the book was 90% finished but that, \\"... I‚Äôm a completely different person than the person who wrote The Book Thief. And this is also the scary thing‚ÄîI‚Äôm a different person to the one who started Bridge of Clay eight, nine years ago ... I‚Äôve got to get it done this year, or else I‚Äôll probably finally have to set it aside.\\" In the two decades of his writing process, Zusak went through several changes and challenges with the novel. He stated in an interview with Publishers Weekly that the most difficult problem was finding the right narrator, and giving that narrator the right voice. For six years a character named Maggie was the narrator of the novel, but upon revision was completely scrapped. His breakthrough of the book came when he first decided to quit the book ‚Äì wherein he realized that he would not have been happy if he had done so, and \\"just had to finish it\\". Zusak compared the writing of the book to The Odyssey, in the sense that the writing of the book was the war, and that a possible sequel to the book would be the exploration of coming home. Publication process Unlike his previous novels, Bridge of Clay had simultaneous publication in multiple countries. In this, Zusak had to make edits for each edition (U.K, Australian, and US). In an interview, he said he went from editing the Australian edition, then moved straight on to the American edition, and back once again to the Australian edition. The U.K and Australian edition involved the same editing within copyediting, however early on had three unique structural edits. Each edition involved work with its own editor - one for each country that all helped differently in their own ways, the most important part being to keep the editions consistent. Reception Reviews Publishers Weekly commented that Zusak builds tension skilfully by his use of foreshadowing and symbolism, which exposes the secrets of the story. They also praised his use of historical scope to create a \\"sensitively rendered tale of loss, grief, and guilt's manifestations\\". Though praising the book for its symbolic weight, The Washington Post points out that the work is burdened by its two decades of rewriting and revising, claiming the story to be 'extravagantly over-engineered'. The Guardian finds that much like his previous novel The Book Thief, Death plays a major part of this work - noting that 'death steals the show'. Noting that his use of colors often leads to \\"theatrical illumination\\", and that this work, unlike his former is \\"affirmatively full of life\\". Kirkus Reviews criticizes how the book romanticizes the violent behavior of the brothers, and the expression of masculinity that reminisces on the \\"boys will be boys\\" attitude. Women in the novel are diminished to secondary roles of love interests and mothers, and diversity within the novel itself is severely lacking - as most characters are presumed white. They note that the read requires \\"painstaking effort and patience\\". The Horn Book Magazine praises Zusak's talent for writing, but also points out that the \\"self-indulgent and elegiac prose\\" drowns out the good storytelling, effectively making the book too demanding for readers, regardless of age. Sales According to Nielsen BookScan, as of 4 March 2019, the book has sold 13,521 copies for ¬£198,958 in the United Kingdom. Awards The novel has been short listed for the 2019 Indie Book Awards, chosen by Australian Independent Booksellers.

Its municipal seat is located in the port town of San Felipe and is located on the north coast of the state, on the Gulf of Mexico. The port is primarily a fishing port, which in recent times has begun significant tourist activity. Location The port town of San Felipe is located 11 kilometers west of Rio Lagartos and at the entrance of the estuary of the R√≠a Lagartos Biosphere Reserve, world-famous for the concentrations of pink flamingoes. The San Felipe estuary runs parallel to the Gulf Coast to the port of El Cuyo. At its origin, most of the houses in San Felipe was built in cedar varnished so it could resist damage from moisture and salt from the coast, however a number of these buildings were destroyed by Hurricane Gilbert in 1988. At present, San Felipe offers many services for ecotourism and adventure, accommodation, excursions by boat in the estuary to observe birds and beaches. The town is a good base for trips to Rio Lagartos. History For some 200 years (approximately), a group of fishermen from a port in the west, perhaps Santa Clara or Dzilam Bravo, made a fishing trip. For some reason they decided to reach the beach. Some say that the reason was bad weather. Upon reaching the beach, the men heard the song Chuleb, native birds of the area. They went to the birds and there found a freshwater spring, known here as the Actam Chuleb (Akta Chuleb the Yucatec Maya, in front or ahead of Chuleb). This spring is now a well located in the main park of the population. The abundant fisheries then became possible after that the men return to the site, taking advantage of a temporary fishing camp, as they do today fishers beaches sanfelipense as Bachul or Chisascab. By exploring the site found good land for farming and hunting, plus fishing and abundant fresh water, so some families have settled in the place. Initially these were from places like Dzidzant√∫n, Dzilam and other places nearby. With the good fishing area, people come from various places such as Panab√° and Sucil√°, among others. Panab√° people, attracted by the abundant fishing, proximity to their farms or for the simple novelty of the new town, was installed at the port. In some cases these people went Panab√°. This explains why many people say Panab√° have lived in San Felipe. We do not know when, but sometime Actam Chuleb changed its name to San Felipe, in honor of San Felipe de Jesus. Andalusia encouraged the people, the people grew up with immigrants from various parts. The port then had two streets forming a cross. To contact the people walking on the streets made of sand, were subsequently sascab, they grow and the population was small bridges crossing the ocaes (arms of water as small rivers which are among the mangroves) to reach other parts of the population. Moreover, much of what is now the jetty of the port was a beach.

It is located in the eastern region of the Yucat√°n Peninsula's northern coast. Panab√° is also the name of the municipality's largest township, which is also its municipal seat (cabecera municipal). The municipality is bounded at the north by the municipalities of San Felipe and Rio Lagartos, at the east by Tizim√≠n, at the south by Sucil√° and at the west by the municipalities of Dzilam de Bravo and Dzilam Gonz√°lez. The modern Spanish spelling Panab√° derives from the place\`s name in the Yucatec Maya language, ', meaning \\"[place of] water found by digging\\". The Mayan name combines the verb ' \\"to dig, to excavate\\" (verbal root pan-) with the noun for \\"water.\\" Political Regionalisation The municipality belongs to the First Federal Electoral District and the Tenth Local Election District.  Foundation  Throughout the colonial period, Panab√° was under the jurisdiction of Valladolid through Tizim√≠n. As a result of changes in the peninsula during the nineteenth century Panab√° was part of the municipality of Tizim√≠n until 1918. Pre-Columbian ruins have been discovered on a site in the village of Panab√° showing that this place was inhabited during the pre- Hispanic period by Indians in the province of Domes. Historical Monuments Architecturally the town is notably attractive. The beautiful temple of San Pedro the Apostle is located in the city. Ethnic Groups The population of indigenous language (Yucatec Maya) speakers (5 years and over) is 2,465 people. Demographic Trends According to the Census of Population and Housing made in June 2010 by the INEGI, the total population of the municipality was 7,461 people, of whom 3,718 are male and 3,713 are female. The total population of the town represents 0.32 per cent of the total population of the state.  Climate  Education, Health and Housing The town has 4 levels of schools: preschool, primary, secondary and high school. There is a library located in the headquarters. A literacy campaign made by the National Institute for Adult Education (INEA) succeeded in reducing illiteracy of the population in the municipality. In 1980, there were 663 people counted as illiterate and by 1986 this number was reduced to 136. According to the 2010 census, the literacy rate for people between 15 and 24 years of age was 97.2%. One medical unit of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS) is found in Panab√°, in addition to private care. Typical housing in the region is constructed from wooden posts with wattle and daub walls (locally known as bajareques) and roofed with Huan, (long narrow plant leaves), however most are built with concrete blocks, cement, wood and sheet-metal. Clothing and Customs Normally women wear simple hupiles, highlighting the embroidered square neck and edge of the clothing. This is worn over a medium length skirt of figured fustian supported by a waistband of the same material. As footwear they wear sandals and to protect themselves from the sun they wear shawls. Country people, especially the elderly, dress in baggy trousers made from blanket material, a shirt buttoned down the front, an apron of ticking and a straw hat. For farm shows and major fiestas the women dress up in the terno, a three piece outfit of full-length white skirt with decorated hem, an under-garment made with fine materials and with a colored border and over this is worn a highly decorated top with a square neck, decorated with lace and usually hand- made embroidery in cross stitch. This is complemented by long gold chains, earrings, coral rosaries, filigree decorations and a shawl with the Virgin Mary. The men wear white straight cut pants, jackets without lapels (locally called Filipino jackets) made of fine material, the better one having gold buttons, espadrilles and jipijapa hats, without forgetting the traditional red scarf popularly known as a bandana and essential for the jarana, a local dance. For All Saints' Day and The Day of the Dead it is tradition to place an altar in a main room in the house, where the favorite food of the dead is offered up to them. Traditional Mucbil chicken accompanied by atole of corn and chocolate beaten with water. In the regional fiestas people dance jaranas and there is showing off among the participants. Food The savory cuisine of the region is composed of pork, chicken and venison, with spicy sauces with a base of habanero chilli and maize. Some of these dishes are: beans with pork, egg with chaya (tree spinach), chicken soup, filled cheese (typically an Edam cheese filled with chopped meat and sauce) salbutes, panuchos, pipi√°n de venado (venison in red pumpkin seed sauce), papadzules, longaniza, cochinita pibil, joroches (various filled fritters), mucbi-chicken (baked chicken pie), and tamales.

The term is often seen as a pejorative, for it implicitly downplays a quarterback's talent or skill by implying that a successful offense is due to a particular scheme or that a quarterback is successful due to his employment under specific circumstances. Russ Lande of Sporting News traced the term's etymology, or at least currency, to the early 1990s, when two University of Houston quarterbacks failed to carry college success into their professional careers. First, Andre Ware, in head coach Jack Pardee and offensive coordinator John Jenkins's run and shoot offense, had a record-setting 1989 season that culminated in a Heisman Trophy. He was the seventh overall pick in the 1990 NFL Draft, but did not have success in either the National Football League or the Canadian Football League.The List: Biggest Heisman Flops, ESPN, retrieved February 14, 2009. David Klingler took over for Ware at UH and was the sixth overall pick in the 1992 NFL Draft. He too, failed to find exceptional success in the NFL. Usage Recently, the appellation was commonly applied to Texas Tech quarterbacks that operated under former head coach Mike Leach and offensive coordinator Dana Holgorsen's spread offense. In the 2000s, the school had several different quarterbacks that threw in excess of 4,000 yards in a season. According to some pundits, this demonstrated that the quarterback had simply been an interchangeable part in a prolific passing offense. Some Texas Tech quarterbacks, with their college tenure in parentheses, described as such include: *Sonny Cumbie (2001‚Äì2004), threw for 4,742 yards his senior year.Quarterback: 'System' label a burden come draft time, Dallas Morning News, April 22, 2005.Quarterbacks Harrell, Bomar are battling perception, Dallas Morning News, January 23, 2009.Sonny Cumbie Stats, ESPN, retrieved February 14, 2009. *Graham Harrell (2004‚Äì2008), threw for 4,555, 5,705, and 5,111 yards his last three years.'09 NFL draft: Top 10 QB prospects, Sports Illustrated, February 12, 2009.Graham Harrell Stats, ESPN, retrieved February 14, 2009. *Cody Hodges (2001‚Äì2005), threw for 4,238 yards his senior year.Cody Hodges Stats, ESPN, retrieved February 14, 2009. *Kliff Kingsbury (1998‚Äì2002), passed for 4,642 yards his senior year.Shaking the 'system' label , Pro Football Weekly, July 5, 2008.Player Bio: Kliff Kingsbury, Texas Tech University, retrieved February 14, 2009. *B.J.

Biography Morinori was the third son of the tenth daimy≈ç of Fukue Domain, Got≈ç Moriakira. However, as both of his elder brothers died at early ages, he was selected as heir, and became eleventh daimy≈ç on the retirement of his father on January 21, 1858. However, as he was of weak constitution, his retired father continued to play an active role in his administration. In 1863, he completed the reconstruction of the family seat at Ishida Castle, the last Japanese castle to be constructed under the Tokugawa Bakufu. He was an early supporter of the Sonn≈ç j≈çi movement, and was ordered to Kyoto in October 1867 to pledge his loyalty to Emperor Meiji. He arrived in Kyoto in 1868, and the new Meiji government ordered him to strengthen the maritime defenses of his island domain against possible incursions by foreign ships. To defray the costs of this program, the new government abolished the subsidiary fief of Tomie, and added its 3000 koku to his revenues. However, the people of Tomie were highly opposed to the union with Fukue, and it was not until July 1869 that he was able to take possession of the new territories. By this time, the position of daimy≈ç had already been abolished, and his official title was that of domain governor. On July 15, 1871, Fukue domain itself was abolished with the abolition of the han system, and became part of the new Nagasaki Prefecture. Morinori relocated to Tokyo. He died in 1875, predeceasing his father, and his grave is at the temple of Kichijo-ji. His descendants were later given the peerage title of shishaku (viscount) under the kazoku peerage system.

The university grants bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees through 17 academic departments and 62 undergraduate majors, and operates the Guiyang Institute for Big Data and Finance. Its honorary president is Professor Hong Yinxing, former Party Secretary of Nanjing University. With a modern campus in the Huaxi University City district, Gui Cai enrolls nearly 20,000 undergraduate students, including 300 students through its Western Michigan Institute (Ë•øÂØÜÊ≠áÊ†πÂ≠¶Èô¢; pinyin: Xƒ´ M√¨xiƒìgƒìn Xu√©yu√†n), an undergraduate college jointly established with Western Michigan University in Michigan, United States and the first Chinese-American education partnership in Guizhou. The university's strategic development plan for 2015-2020 focuses primarily on increasing the quality of undergraduate teaching and curricula. Other major goals include hiring a \\"first-class\\" faculty, raising research standards and quality, and developing more international partnerships. History The university was established on August 21, 1958 by combining three provincial schools which trained party cadres in economics, management, marketing, supply chain management, and other necessary skills for government service. The new institution was named the Guizhou College of Finance and Economics () and was based in the Hebin District of Guiyang, where the university continues to maintain a campus. During the Cultural Revolution, the institution was forced to suspend operations. It was re-established in 1978 and admitted its first class of undergraduate students that year. In 1992, the College absorbed the provincial party cadre training school for economic planning. In 2002, the institution relocated most of its facilities from its Hebin campus to a new campus in Luchongguan District, and granted its first master's degree in 2004. On June 15, 2012, after approval from the Ministry of Education, the institution held a ceremony and changed its name to the Guizhou University of Finance and Economics. In 2013, the university began moving facilities and students to a state-of-the-art campus in Huaxi University City, a new district in Guiyang that had begun construction in 2011. The university began to pursue more international partnerships in 2012 with the establishment of a joint undergraduate finance program with the Edinburgh Napier University, a public university in the United Kingdom. In 2015, the university established its Western Michigan Institute, an undergraduate college in collaboration with Western Michigan University, a state university in Michigan, United States. Gui Cai also maintains programs in accounting, financial insurance, marketing, and logistics management policy jointly organized with Berkeley College, a for-profit college in New Jersey, United States. In 2018, the university was authorized to grant its first doctoral degrees.

Huaxi University City  Gui Cai is headquartered in Huaxi University City, at its modern campus constructed in 2011. The campus spans 5,106.8 acres with building space totaling 1.06 million square meters. The university library system contains 2.21 million books, 1.59 million e-books, and 36,000 domestic and foreign academic journals.  Older campuses  The university continues to maintain its Luchongguan District campus, in operation since 2002, and the Hebin District campus, the original site of the three provincial party cadre schools which merged in 1958 to form the institution.  Confucius Institute in Eritrea  Since 2013, the university has been the host institution of the Confucius Institute at the Eritrean Commission on Higher Education in Eritrea. The institute is housed on the grounds of the former University of Asmara and collaborates with the nearby public colleges and primary and secondary schools. Faculty and staff from Gui Cai have traveled to Eritrea to conduct Chinese language classes and host Chinese cultural festivals, while Eritrean students learning Chinese traveled to China to study at Gui Cai. Additionally, staff and Eritrean students of the institute have translated Eritrean textbooks into Chinese and developed a localized curriculum for teaching Chinese.

Because the stadium did not use a traditional organ, Bardwell played an Ensoniq keyboard with a classic ballpark organ sample stored on a floppy disk. During pitching changes and delays, he played other music to pump up the fans, and he was also tasked with playing favorite songs selected by players who were up to bat. Bardwell became something of a local celebrity in 2002, when The Plain Dealer ran a feature piece dubbing him \\"The Phantom of Jacobs Field.\\" He left the Indians in 2006.

He serves as the deputy director of the Bronx Council on the Arts, and runs the group's writing center. His fiction, erotica and essays have appeared in a number of anthologies, magazines, and websites. He lives in Brooklyn, New York, with his partner, poet John Williams. Early years and education  Charlie Luis V√°zquez was born at Fordham Hospital in The Bronx, New York, on May 14, 1971, to a Cuban-Puerto Rican mother and Puerto Rican father. He is oldest of five children. His earliest years were spent in the disinvested East Tremont neighborhood of the Bronx, where his parents befriended several members of the Reapers, a notorious South Bronx street gang. His family then moved north, to the Fordham neighborhood, where he became fascinated by a small white cottage in a nearby park that was poet Edgar Allan Poe‚Äôs final home. Before divorcing in 1981, his parents moved the family east, to Allerton Avenue and White Plains Road, where V√°zquez attended the Richard Rodgers School, PS 96, Whalen Junior High School and Christopher Columbus High School, where he served as a lead trumpet player in orchestras and jazz bands. V√°zquez recalls, ‚ÄúI grew up with a range of influences, some very dark. But music and books were always a way to open up my eyes to a different world, something to escape to,‚Äù who, as a young child ‚Äúbecame attached to playing the trumpet and reading through scores of second-hand books‚Äù. Career  V√°zquez's first novel, Buzz and Israel (Fireking Press, 2004),V√°zquez, Charlie. Buzz and Israel. New York: Fireking Press, 2004. details the complicated relationship between Israel, a closeted Puerto Rican actor, and Buzz, a junkie and jewelry store thief. Inspired by the writings of Jean Genet and William S. Burroughs, the novel follows the passionate and dysfunctional relationship from Portland, Oregon, where they meet, to New York City, where the story ends, by way of Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, the Mojave Desert and Phoenix, Arizona. The ‚Äúintoxicated work of transient fiction‚Äù was inspired by his youthful years on the West Coast, where he experimented with drugs, sexuality, recorded experimental music and traveled throughout the Western United States and Vancouver, British Columbia. He had left New York City for Portland, Oregon in 1988. He joined a band and studied music production believing music ‚Äúwas the voice he had long been searching‚Äù but learned the ‚Äúwritten word held a magnetic attraction‚Äù. Buzz and Israel explores the twilight worlds of transsexual shamans, heroin addicts, Santer√≠a priestesses and queer criminals. Its third-person voice examines the unique experiences of a New York Latino (Israel) immersed in a mostly white American subculture. In a panel on Latino contemporary literature at Fordham University, V√°zquez stated, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Latino. I‚Äôm gay. I am both of those things and to recognize that is a celebration of my sexuality and my roots.‚Äù Buzz and Israel was followed by Business as Unusual (2007, Fireking Press) is a fiction collection composed of two novellas and three short stories that were written in Southern California, Baja California, Oregon, and New York City. This collection of fiction explores themes of transsexuality, fortune-telling, reincarnation, mesmerism and fetishism, as told through the first-person narratives of strange and revealing narrators. His second novel, Contraband (2010, Rebel Satori Press) superimposes a 1959 Cuban Revolution-styled technological overhaul of government onto the United States of the near future, where intellectuals, queers and artists are sought and executed by a faceless dictatorship. V√°zquez is one of thirty bloggers who support Latino Rebels website which launched May 5 (Cinco de Mayo) in 2011, and features on social media. Their primary objective is to \\"kill stereotypes with humor, insight, [and] compassion\\" while empowering the Latino community. The book Hustler Rave XXX: Poetry of the Eternal Survivor (2013), is a collection of poems about gay male prostitution written by V√°zquez and David Caleb-Acevedo. In 2013 he co-founded the start-up Editorial Trance (ET) with Marlena Fitzpatrick, and serves as Chief Creative Officer. The e-book publisher covers works \\"...that are culturally and historically relevant to the Latino community, which has been largely ignored by the major [publishers]\\", according to V√°zquez. ET's launch title was Demystifying a Diva: The truth behind the myth of La Lupe, about La Lupe, the \\"Queen of Latin Soul\\".

It is powered by flow diversion from the ƒåunovo dam. Since 1997, it has hosted a full schedule of local, regional, and international competitions, including multiple World Cup races, 2 European Championships and the 2011 World Championships. The slalom course is built on an island that straddles the ƒåunovo dam in the Danube river. Course description The Centre has two parallel whitewater channels; the drop is the same for both channels, . The left channel is 356 meters long, with a 1.9% slope of 19 m/km (98 ft/mile) and a streamflow of 7 to 22 m3/s (247 to 777 ft3/s). The right channel is 460 meters long, with a 1.4% slope of 14 m/km (76 ft/mile) and a streamflow of 7 to 12 m3/s (247 to 424 ft3/s). When both channels are watered, the left channel streamflow is 15 m3/s (530 ft3/s) and the right is 7 m3/s (247 ft3/s).Water Sport Centre-Technical Data, 30 July 2007, retrieved 7 November 2012. The two channels are connected at two crossover points, making a total of five alternative routes from start to finish. From a start in the left channel, there are three ways to run the course; from a right channel start there are two. Any run which ends up in the left channel includes a sheer final drop called \\"Niagara.\\" Niagara, the last drop of the left channel, is often the location of gate #20 in international canoe slalom competition. A conveyor-belt boat lift carries paddlers in their boats up to a 225-meter-long return canal on a level with the start pool. The ƒåunovo Water Sports Centre was built in 1996 on an island near the mid-river end of the ƒåunovo dam, a flood control feature of the ƒåunovo to Gabƒç√≠kovo dam system. The island is high enough to remain dry during floods. In March 2002 and again the same August, the whitewater course was inundated, but the buildings and most of the island remained above water. When the Water Sports Centre operates at full capacity, with the two whitewater channels carrying a combined total of 22 m3/s (777 ft3/s), it siphons off between 9% and 4.5% of the river's normal flow of 250 to 600 m3/s (8,830 to 21,200 ft3/s). Two parallel race courses, with crossovers Gate map for Semi-finals & Finals, 2013 World Cup Final Event, 24 August Gate map for Heats, 2013 World Cup Final Event, 23 August Full course operation represents a 4 megawatt sacrifice of electricity production at the Gabƒç√≠kovo dam 30 km farther downstream. Although the water flowing through the slalom course represents only 1.4 megawatts of energy, if it stayed in the reservoir until it reached the Gabƒç√≠kovo dam, with a higher vertical drop, its energy potential would be greater.When a streamflow of 1 m3/s drops 1 m in height, the energy expenditure is 9.8 kilowatts. This fact makes the course more expensive to operate, in energy terms, than a similar pump-powered facility. ƒåunovo Dam The \\"Budapest Treaty\\" of 1977, between Hungary and Czechoslovakia, was a plan to tame the Danube and increase its navigability with levees, dams, locks, overflow channels, and designated flood plains, and to generate hydroelectricity. The joint project was intended to cover the entire 150 km stretch of the Danube as it forms the border between Slovakia and Hungary, from the upstream, western, end at ƒåunovo, Slovakia, to Nagymaros, Hungary, in the east. Construction started when the Soviet Union broke up in 1991, but only on the Slovakian side. In 1989, Hungary had suspended its participation and in 1992 backed out of the 1977 treaty altogether. Slovakia has been in litigation with Hungary ever since. In 1992, Slovakia completed the 30 km section from ƒåunovo to Gabƒç√≠kovo, which includes a dam at each end, each dam spanning half the river width, the two dams being connected by a 30-km long levee, all of which combine to impound the 40 km2 ƒåunovo reservoir and force the river into a navigation channel on the left side of the riverbed. The ƒåunovo dam, on river right at the upstream end, is a flood control feature with 27 spillways to send excess water into the bypass channel and flood plain south of the navigation channel. The Gabƒç√≠kovo dam, at the downstream end, contains the main navigation locks and the hydropower plant, which began operation in 1996 and now provides electricity equal to 11% of the total Slovakian demand. Its maximum capacity is 720 megawatts at a water discharge rate of 4,000 m3/s (141,000 ft3/s). The two dams and the levee support a two-lane road which is the first Danube river crossing below Bratislava, but vehicles must drive the length of the 30-km levee to complete the crossing. This is the road which provides access to the Water Sports Centre, mid-river at the ƒåunovo end.

Formed in 1991, the group originally featured vocalist Aaron Hagar, lead guitarist \\"Smokin' Joe\\" Bonamassa, rhythm guitarist Waylon Krieger, bassist Berry Oakley, Jr., drummer Erin Davis and keyboardist Lou Segreti. After Hagar was fired due to creative differences, Oakley took over as lead vocalist and the group began recording demos for a planned studio album with producer Phil Ramone. Bloodline later signed with EMI Records and released their self-titled debut album in 1994, which was produced by Joe Hardy. The band broke up shortly after the album's touring cycle. Originally formed as Bonamassa's backing band with the help of the guitarist's manager Roy Weisman, Bloodline's name was chosen based on the fact that four of the group's founding members were the sons of famous musicians ‚Äì Hagar of Van Halen frontman Sammy Hagar, Krieger of former The Doors guitarist Robby Krieger, Oakley, Jr. of original Allman Brothers Band bassist Berry Oakley, and Davis of prolific jazz trumpeter Miles Davis. Following the band's breakup, Bloodline's members went on to join a range of other rock groups, while Bonamassa started his solo career in 2000 with the release of his debut album A New Day Yesterday. History After the young guitarist was turned down by several record labels as a solo artist, the idea of building a band around Joe Bonamassa was proposed by his manager Roy Weisman in 1991. That year, the guitarist performed at a tribute concert for Fender founder Leo Fender, which also featured former The Doors guitarist Robby Krieger's eponymous band, a group which included Krieger's son Waylon on rhythm guitar and The Allman Brothers Band bassist Berry Oakley's son Berry, Jr. on bass. Bonamassa approached Oakley, Jr. with the idea of forming a band together, with Krieger included on the suggestion of the bassist, and jazz trumpeter Miles Davis's son Erin added on drums later. After enlisting lead vocalist Aaron Hagar (son of Van Halen frontman Sammy Hagar) and keyboardist Lou Segreti (a former bandmate of Bonamassa's), the band was finalised and the name Bloodline chosen based on the fact that four members were the sons of famous musicians. After the finalisation of the band's formation, Bloodline began recording their first demos with producer Phil Ramone, initially working in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and later in Manhattan, New York. Hagar was fired from the band later in the year, primarily due to a differing opinion on the musical direction of the group ‚Äì Segreti stated that \\"he was leaning toward commercial ballads while the rest of Bloodline wanted to stick to the blues\\". The band later recorded their self-titled debut album with producer and engineer Joe Hardy at Ardent Studios in Memphis, Tennessee, which was released by EMI and Capitol Records on August 23, 1994. The album's lead single \\"Stone Cold Hearted\\", released on August 8, registered at number 32 on the US Billboard Mainstream Rock Songs chart. The album received positive reviews from a number of publications including Cash Box magazine and The Washington Post, both of whom focused their praise on Bonamassa's lead guitar performance. Bloodline toured extensively in promotion of their self-titled album, including a string of dates supporting Tesla and Lynyrd Skynyrd between May and July 1995. EMI also embarked on what Billboard magazine's Carrie Borzillo described as \\"one of its most aggressive marketing campaigns\\" in support of the album, including packaging sampler cassette tapes with The Allman Brothers Band live album An Evening with the Allman Brothers Band: 2nd Set, giving away free copies of the band's third single \\"Calling Me Back\\", and running a competition to win a Fender guitar before each show on the tour. After the touring cycle, Bloodline announced to Weisman that they wanted to continue the band without Bonamassa, changing their style from blues-rock to alternative rock; Weisman chose to relinquish his role with the band in favour of continuing to work with the guitarist on a solo career, and the group disbanded shortly after. Following the band's breakup, Davis worked as a manager of his father's estate, acting as executive producer on several of his posthumous releases; Oakley joined Los Angeles, California-based band Gift Horse, and Krieger continued performing in his father's band, as well as becoming an actor.

He has been described as one of the most enigmatic literary figures of Australia and his many works are centred on Australian Aboriginal characters and Aboriginal topics. Also known as Mudrooroo Narogin and Mudrooroo Nyoongah. Narogin after the Indigenous spelling for his place of birth, and Nyoongah after the name of the people from whom he claimed descent. Mudrooroo means paperbark in the Bibbulmun language group spoken by the Noongar.  Biography  Born Colin Johnson, Mudrooroo was separated from his mother (his father had died before he was born) shortly before his ninth birthday. After spending seven years at Clontarf Boys' Town, he was turned out of the institution at the age of sixteen. He turned to burglary and served two stints in Fremantle Prison, where he began writing literature. After leaving prison, he traveled to India and London before settling in Melbourne. His first novel Wild Cat Falling, a coming-of-age story set in Western Australia, became a bestseller when it was published in 1965. He then spent periods living in India and the United States, where he finished his novel Long Live Sandawara (published 1979) about the Bunuba resistance hero Jandamarra. After returning to Australia, he took on the name of Mudrooroo. With Jack Davis, he co-founded the National Aboriginal and Islander Writers, Oral Literature, and Dramatists Association. He was also head of Aboriginal Studies at Murdoch University in Perth. After the 1996 controversy surrounding his Aboriginal identity, Mudrooroo spent fifteen years living in India and Nepal, where he married and had a son. In 2011 he and his family returned to Australia, where he published Balga Boy Jackson (2017) and began work on an (unfinished) autobiography. Controversy over Aboriginality In early 1996, a member of the Nyoongah community questioning Mudrooroo's Aboriginality approached journalist Victoria Laurie. Informed that Mudrooroo's oldest sister, Betty Polglaze, had conducted genealogical research in 1992 that traced some (although not all) of her family back five generations, Laurie contacted Polglaze. Polglaze, who identified as a white person, told Laurie that she could find no trace of Aboriginal ancestry in the family. Laurie subsequently wrote an article for her newspaper titled Identity Crisis sparking a scandal that received nationwide media coverage in 1996/97.Maureen Clark Mudrooroo: a likely story : identity and belonging in postcolonial Australia p. 41Fakes, Literary Identity and Public Culture Maria Takolander and David McCooey Deakin UniversityWho's who?: hoaxes, imposture and identity crises in Australian literature Maggie Nolan, Carrie Dawson 2004 p. 102 ‚Äì 104 A request by the Nyoongah community to substantiate his claimed kinship to the Kickett family was not acknowledged because he was overseas and then in the process of relocating interstate.

He had said of Morgan's book My Place that it made Aboriginality acceptable so long as you were \\"young, gifted and not very black.\\"The Wanda Koolmatrie hoax: Who cares? Does it matter? Of course it does! Adelaidian 21 April 2007Who's who? Mapping hoaxes and imposture in Australian literary history Australian Literary Studies Volume 21, Issue 4, 1 October 2004 Mudrooroo's writings had placed emphasis on kinship and family links as key features of Aboriginal identity. His rejection of his biological family deeply offended some in the Aboriginal community. The resulting scandal and public debate over issues of authenticity and what constitutes Aboriginal identity led to some subject coordinators removing Mudrooroo's books from academic courses and he later said he was unable to find a publisher for a sequel to his previous novel.Maureen Clark Mudrooroo: a likely story : identity and belonging in postcolonial Australia p. 9 ‚Äì 11 Initially, many people came to Mudrooroo's defence, some claiming it was a \\"white conspiracy\\" or a racist attack on AboriginalityMaureen Clark Mudrooroo: a likely story : identity and belonging in postcolonial Australia p. 72 with some claiming Polglaze's \\"amateur sleuthing\\" was being exploited.Maureen Clark Mudrooroo: a likely story : identity and belonging in postcolonial Australia p. 42 On 19 July 1996, the Western Australian Genealogical Society certified the Johnson family heritage as \\"authentic\\". Award-winning Indigenous author Graeme Dixon called on Mudrooroo to come forward and tell the truth, stressing that it was important to \\"out\\" pretenders and reclaim Aboriginal culture.Maureen Clark Mudrooroo: a likely story : identity and belonging in postcolonial Australia p. 43 Several authors see evidence in his writings that Mudrooroo deliberately assumed an Aboriginal identity to legitimise his work when in his early 20s, although it remains possible he was unaware. Editor Gerhard Fischer believes that it was Dame Mary Durack, though not Aboriginal herself, who \\"defined and determined\\" his Aboriginal identity. In an article published in 1997, Mudrooroo described Durack's foreword to his first novel as the origin of the \\"re-writing of his body\\" as Aboriginal. Mudrooroo later replied to his critics, stating that his dark skin meant he was always treated as Aboriginal by society, therefore his life experience was that of an Aborigine.Mudrooroo Authors.

Plot Ever since he was a young child, Sora Aoi had always exchanged words of \\"I love you\\" with his attractive older sister Aki. Now, as he comes of age, he finds it much harder to exchange such comforts as they did in those simpler times. When Aki demonstrates her feelings toward him to go beyond a sister's love, Sora finds himself questioning his feelings for his sister. Realizing their affection for one another, they consummate their love in secret. In a society that would never understand, they must now keep their love a secret from their family and everyone they know. However, Sora soon finds himself exploring many forms of love with different kinds of women he met that is not accepted by society thus questioning his feelings for his sister. Characters Aoi family ; : :His first name is written as ËíºÁ©∫ (S≈çk≈´) in kanji. He studies in the same high school as his sisters, Aki and Nami. Unlike his sisters, he is good at cooking and housework. Sora has a low alcohol tolerance, as he falls unconscious by drinking even a little sake. :Due to his upbringing without a father or any male figure in the household, as well as questionably awkward relationships with his sisters, Sora was raised with virtually no masculinity of any kind. Almost all of his postures, behavior, and mannerisms are those typically expected from a shy girl. His effeminate appearance makes him a perfect candidate for cross-dressing, which he finds himself engaging in involuntarily because of Nami's fetish and Runa's belief that he enjoys it. He is very shy and very much a pushover, and completely lacks the will to stand up for himself against girls, which further allows him to be forced to cross-dress and sexually approached. Indeed very much every girl around him is immediately privileged with the opportunity to rape him, which some of them did or attempted to undeterred by his discomfort and protests. :He is deeply in love with Aki, and does not resist her the second time she tries to have sex with him, but he does question himself at times whether their incest taboo should be continued, since they have no future in a relationship. He has also had sexual relationships with other people, such as Kana, Runa and Nami, though with the latter two he was forced. After being raped by Nami, who then threatened Sora with emasculation and death if anything about the rape should ever be brought to light, he became terrified of her, but claimed that he does not hate her. They eventually rekindle their relationship when Nami asked for consensual sex, and had since then became more close. In the final chapters, Sora fully accepts his relationship with Aki, even defending it against their father. When Aki is taken away by their father, Sora is lonely and wants to see her again. After Aki chooses to go away so that Sora would not be hurt by their love, Sora is heartbroken and realizes that he truly loves Aki and wants to be with her. In the final chapter, they meet at their mother's grave. ; : :Aki is Sora's elder sister. Her first name is written as ‰∫úÂ∏å (Aki) in kanji. Attractive, athletic, and intelligent, she‚Äôs considered a model student at school and is highly popular. However, at home, she has no culinary talents and fails to keep her own room clean. She is deeply in love with Sora. Unlike the rest of her family, all of whom have blond hair, Aki is a brunette. She first attempts to have sex with Sora in the shower, but is unsuccessful, as Sora runs out of the bath in embarrassment. However, her second attempt, in his room, is successful, after which she gives him a heart-felt confession of her love towards him. After that, they engage in sexual intercourse many times, including in public places, such as the school gym's storage locker, an onsen, and on top of a ferris wheel. During these times, she does not want Sora to call her nƒìsan (elder sister), but Sora feels weird saying her name. She seems to be unaware that he has had sex with other women, other than herself. Sora's grades drop as a result of the distraction of his relationship with his sister. In response to this Aki refuses to have sex with him until his grades improve, and she cries at the thought of her flirting being the reason that Sora is doing poorly at school. After noticing how close Sora and Nami seem to be, Aki takes him out-of-town to spend some time together alone. However, on the train there, Sora seems to reject her advances. When she tries to seduce him again at the park, they almost get caught. Ultimately, they rekindle their romance in a love hotel. However, after their father's death, she decides that they should end their relationship so that Sora does not get hurt any further and says goodbye to him. They later meet up at their mother's grave. ; : :Nami is Sora's younger twin sister whose features are almost completely identical to his (though in the anime her eye color is red, while Sora's eyes are brown; also, her hair is slightly darker than Sora's). Due to their similar appearance, Nami ties her hair in pigtails. Her hair is slightly longer than Sora's when let down and this is the only noticeable physical difference between them aside from their gender. Like Sora, Nami has a low tolerance to alcohol. :When they were children, she'd often pretend to be Sora, but as they grew up, it became apparent that their personalities are polar opposites. Unlike the quiet and well-behaved Sora, Nami is blunt and can be incredibly stubborn and harsh, and also quite eerie and threatening towards her brother. For instance, she had a habit of smashing his toys when they were children out of jealousy, and often forces Sora to cosplay for her own amusement. She has a very strong disregard for Sora's feelings, demonstrated by how she deceived him into signing up for the cosplay club for further cross-dressing, despite his clear discomfort, and upon receiving his resignation letter, she immediately tore it up in front of him without consideration. :She's secretly in love with her classmate Kana, though the latter is completely oblivious of the fact. In spite of this, she's actively trying to get Kana and Sora together. These efforts, culminating with her bearing witness to Sora and Kana having sex together, backfire on her and drove her into a dangerously precarious state of mind. Guided by the belief that her being a female and thus lacking a penis is what keeps her and Kana separated she assaults Sora in a fit of psychotic rage and, after almost cutting off his penis and slitting his throat with a pair of scissors, she proceeds to rape him, fantasizing during the whole act that she is making love to Kana. She obtains his silence through a death threat, and since then Nami has repeatedly had sex with Sora, rekindling their relationship and becoming more intimate. While vocally expressing her disgust at the act, she is becoming more and more obsessed with it, especially right after he has sex with Kana, craving her scent. It is unknown if she herself is attracted to Sora, or having sex with him is a way to vent her frustration. She is, however, apparently regretful of what she has done to her brother, though this, coupled with their unhealthy relationship, is gnawing more and more at her already unbalanced psyche. Despite this, Aki has noted since then that the twins have become much closer to each other. Nami's relationship with Sora is later discovered by Kana, and the three end up having sex together, during which Nami's feelings towards Kana are finally revealed. ;Aoi family mother (false) : :The as-yet-unnamed mother of the Aoi family, who is actually Aki, Sora, and Nami's mother's identical younger twin sister (to be precise, their maternal aunt), but ever since her sister ‚Äî the kids' real mother ‚Äî was killed in a traffic accident ten years ago, she has taken over the role as mother. She took over the role of their mother, and did not tell the twins that their real mother died. She is usually busy working to support the family, and is not there for them, leading them to learn to live for themselves. She is also somewhat irresponsible, giving Nami some sake, when she is clearly underage, and appears somehow aloof and indifferent, something that puzzled Sora more than once. There is a running gag where she is unable to tell Nami and Sora apart, even when they are naked. Every day, she thinks about whether she should live the role as a false mother, and thought of telling Sora and Nami the truth. Sora himself is starting to question her identity, as she often forgets or is even oblivious of things easily identified by their late mother. Nevertheless, after being questioned about it by Sora, she even went so far as to procure herself a scar on an arm so as to mimic the one her late sister had, much to Aki's regret. However, they noted that one day they will tell the truth to the twins. In the manga, she was portrayed to have blonde hair, but in the second OVA, she is a light brunette. ;Aoi family mother (true) :The real unnamed mother of the three Aoi children, she died ten years ago, when she was hit by a car while returning home from shopping. Her role as mother was taken over by her younger twin sister, and only Aki knows about it. When she first gave birth to Aki, she felt the body was surprisingly light, and offered her sister a chance to hold the baby. She sustained a scar during one Christmas in a cooking accident, in which her left arm was burned while saving Sora from falling. Eventually, Sora came to know her death, when he visited her grave at the end. ;Aoi family father :The unnamed father of the three Aoi children, who makes his appearance in Chapter 26. He is a big man with dark hair like Aki and is very scary-looking. He walked out on the family when the Aoi children were very young, hence why Sora and Nami do not want anything to do with him. He returns to take Aki to live with him. He caught Aki and Sora when they were making love and punished Sora for it. It is revealed that the mothers of the Aoi children (true and false) are, in fact, his identical twin sisters, having had children with one of them, but left his family because society did not accept this. He eventually dies in a hospital from an unknown illness. Classmates ; : :Kana is Sora's classmate and Nami‚Äôs best friend. Kana and Nami are the only members of the cosplay club. She makes female outfits for Sora and Nami forces these outfits unto her brother. She has feelings for Sora but is too shy to confess them. She is unaware of Nami's feelings towards her. Even when Nami stated she loved her, Kana believed it meant because they were friends. After a date, at which Kana gave Sora a kiss and performed oral sex on him, Nami, who was witnessing from a cupboard, snapped, leading to her raping Sora. After some persuasion from Nami later, Kana loses her virginity to Sora, which Nami secretly records. It is vaguely expressed that Kana loved Nami after this, as Kana remembers the first time she had met with Sora, and believed it was fate, because she had the chance to love a boy who looked exactly like Nami. She later stumbles upon Sora and Nami's affair and joins them in three way, where Nami's feelings for Kana are eventually revealed. ; : :Runa is Sora's senior at school. Ever since being forced to walk home from school only wearing her school swimsuit, she's been an exhibitionist. Sora first meets her as she was changing bare in the elevator at their apartment complex. She mistakenly thinks Sora finds cross- dressing exciting. She later forces Sora on a \\"fetish\\" date with her‚Äîshe is wearing only a raincoat, and he is in drag‚Äîand forces him to masturbate to her masturbating. Later, she tricks Sora into going to a swap sex orgy with her, as her pretend-boyfriend. She loses her virginity as Sora watches; they held hands through random partners. During the summer break, she takes him to the pool having him wear a girl's bathing suit while she painted a swimsuit on her body, where she pleasures Sora for helping with her exhibitionism again. It is unknown whether she has any feelings for Sora, however she has stated that it is only \\"good\\" if he is the one to see her naked. Because of this she has not returned to the \\"party\\", even though asked many times. In the autumn, Runa returns as a nude art model for the art club. ; :Natsumi is Sora's classmate. She attended the party that Hitomi had, and was one of the many girls to have set eyes on having sex with Sora. She felt a little annoyed when Sora had difficulty at remembering her at first sight at the party. She expressed slight resentment when she heard rumors from Nami that Sora and Kana were going out. ; : :Alice is Aki's classmate. She is a beautiful girl with blond hair, girlfriend of Miharu Mihara, the school's student council president and self-proclaimed rival of Aki. As Alice is second place in the test results (under Aki), she tends to act distastefully towards Aki. Aki, however, is oblivious to this rivalry and considers themselves as friends, much to Alice's irritation. Due to this rivalry, when Miharu asked Sora to have sex with Alice to satisfy her in his (Miharu's) place, Alice was skeptical due to Sora being Aki's brother. Regardless, Alice loved Miharu dearly, and agreed to have sex with Sora, and even giving up her virginity to him. Later, all three play a fantasy game, in which Alice rapes Sora for real while Miharu watches. ; : :Yuna is the president of the school's art club. She agreed to let Runa take over as a substitute for the nude model in class, but noticed that the boys were looking at her more than drawing, and got angry at it. However, Runa correctly guessed that Yuna was aroused by the atmosphere. Runa later encourages her to have sex with Sora in order to overcome her embarrassment around nude males. Others ; : :Hitomi is Runa's friend. She held the orgy party that Runa tricked Sora into going, and had her sight set on Sora at the party's start. She was the first one to have sex with Sora at the party, and her boyfriend was the one who took Runa's virginity. After this party, Hitomi invited Runa to return many times, but because Runa only felt good with Sora, she did not return. ; :Miharu is Sora's childhood friend who used to live in the same apartment complex with the Aoi family. He is younger than Sora, and Sora addresses him as \\"Mi-chan\\", and would view him as a younger brother, were it not for Miharu's tendency to cross-dress as a girl. Miharu has an effeminate appearance, similar to Sora, but unlike Sora, he likes to cross-dress. He came to Sora's school in order to ask Sora to have sex with his girlfriend, Alice, because Miharu himself has erectile dysfunction, in order to make Alice happy. Miharu is shameless, as he not only cross-dresses and asks his friend to take away his girlfriend's virginity, but also narrates about Alice and Sora having sex with vulgar phrases. He got over his conditions only when witnessing Alice and Sora having sex. However, once Sora leaves and it was his turn, Miharu became ED again. Therefore, he asks Sora to take care of Alice. ; :Kana's younger sister who appeared in Chapter 21 with their father to photograph Kana and Sora as wedding models. She hopes they will marry so that Nami can be her sister.

This plant is endemic to central Chile; an example occurrence is in the area of La Campana National Park and Cerro La Campana. The tree is a well known allergenic and can cause a rash of the skin, the effects and susceptibility of which can vary greatly from person to person.  Description  Litre is evergreen, with oval leaves with a smooth or undulating border. It can grow to be a full tree when undisturbed; the tree-like formation was formerly common, but it is now most frequently found as a shrub due to changing patterns of land use. It has dense leaves due to the high levels of lignin and cellulose. It grows large, underground burls from which new growth with emerge after it is cut or burned down; it shares this trait with most of the woody plants in its region.  Toxicology  The leaves and branches of litre induces severe dermatitis after contact with human skin. The dermatitis characterized by swelling and itching in some people. The allergenic agent of litre is 3‚Äìpentadecyl (10‚Äìenyl) catechol (litreol), an urushiol similar in structure to the allergens from poison oak and poison ivy. Metabolism Lithraea caustica has been studied for diurnal variation in photosynthetic function in various seasons. In early summer the photosynthetic peak occurs relatively soon in the morning and declines steadily the remainder of the day; whereas, in late summer there is a morning peak, midday low and a late afternoon peak. Ecology Litre grows in matorral climates (i.e., areas with similar climates to the southern Mediterranean); its range in Central Chile is the broadest of any matorral shrub in the region. It has been found to increase in abundance in response to grazing. The plant propagates through the dispersal of seedlings. Instrumental in this dispersal are both birds (Turdus falklandii, Mimus thenca, Phytotoma rara) and foxes (Pseudalopex spp.) It is drought resistant, due to its deep and extensive root system. Probably due to its toxicity, litre is one of the least disturbed plants in its habitats. The plant and its surrounding soil have been found to be home to 29 families, 57 genera and 69 species of beetles.  Scientific History  Litre has been described in the scientific literature since at least the early 18th century. Explorer and botanist Louis Feuill√©e reported that sailors on his expedition experienced severe reactions after cutting down some 'Llithi' trees. It was given its first binomial name, Laurus caustica, by William Jackson Hooker and George Arnott Walker-Arnott in 1832.

He grew up in Dresden as the son of an art publisher. He learned violin at the from which he graduated in 1896. Thereafter he studied violin at the Berlin School of Music under Joseph Joachim. From 1898 until 1902 he studied music in Berlin and Leipzig and wrote his dissertation on the instrumental concertos of Antonio Vivaldi (in German, Geschichte des Instrumentalkonzertes bei Antonio Vivaldi) and this work was influential in resurrecting the music of this composer.Fred K. Prieberg: Handbuch Deutsche Musiker 1933‚Äì1945, CD-Rom-Lexikon, Kiel 2004, pages 6.084‚Äì6.086. In 1907 he made his habilitation and was made a professor of music in 1915. In 1920 Schering gathered evidence that composer Johann Sebastian Bach usually used 12 singers in his cantatas and other vocal works. This insight eventually became influential in the early music movement. From 1928 onward he taught as a professor of musicology in Berlin. After the Nazis rose to power, Schering became a member of the National Socialist Teachers League and the executive council of the Reichsmusikkammer. Until 1936 he served as president of the German Society for Musicology (until 1933 the German Music Society),Ernst Klee: Das Kulturlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945. S. Fischer, Frankfurt am Main 2007, S. 520. which was transformed according to Nazi principles: \\"The employment of young Nazis was encouraged, but Alfred Einstein (1880-1952) was forced to resign from the editorship of the Journal of Musicology, which he had led since its first appearance in 1918. The \\"F√ºhrerprinzip\\" followed, especially in 1936 or 1937 under Ludwig Schiedermair (1876‚Äì1957), who succeeded him as president\\". In January 1934, Schering delivered a lecture at the German Society for Education about \\"The Germanic in German music\\" In the same year appeared his book \\"Beethoven in a New Interpretation\\" in which he parallels in the works of Beethoven scenes from Shakespeare's plays, and where Schering put forward the bold claim that this formal design along the line of Shakespeare scenes was intentional. Also in the same year he wrote an article in the Journal for Musicology where he characterized Beethoven's famous 5th symphony as a \\"Symphony of National Rising,\\" much in the sense of the rising of the National Socialist regime. Finally in 1936, he wrote, in Beethoven and Poetry, \\"If a brutal, sensual, and to us, racially-foreign music threatens to alienate us from the insoluble relationship between high music and high art, it is in Beethoven we can once again make a new ideal covenant.\\"Quoted by Ernst Klee: Das Kulturlexikon zum Dritten Reich, p. 520. In August 1940 he took leave from his work due to illness. He died the following year and was buried in the Friedhof Heerstra√üe. The location of his grave is unknown.

It was worn by queens, high-ranking court ladies, and royalty during the Joseon dynasty of Korea (1392-1910). It is also called 'daeui' (Â§ßË°£, big clothing), 'daesu' (Â§ßË¢ñ, wide sleeves) and 'jangsam' (Èï∑Ë°´, long clothing). The queen, princess consort, and consort to the first son of the crown prince wore it as a soryebok, a robe for small ceremonies, while wives of high officers and sanggung (court matrons) wore it as daeryebok, a robe for major ceremonies. The color and decorations of the garment around the chest, shoulders and back represent the wearer's rank. For example, the color yellow was used for the wonsam of empresses, red for queens, jajeok (Á¥´Ëµ§ magenta) for concubines and princess consorts, and green for princesses and women of the noble yangban class. After being popularised by royalty, commoners were granted permission to wear wonsam at weddings only, only the green wonsam. Varieties of silk were used as the fabric. Wonsam for winter were made with dan (Á∑û), a thick silk with a glossy surface formed with a satin weave, and wonsam for summer were made with sa (Á¥ó), a loosely woven silk. Unlike the po, an indigenous Korean overcoat with narrow sleeves, the wonsam was based on an overcoat with broad sleeves of the Chinese Tang dynasty. The Chinese clothing system was introduced to Korea when King Munmu, the 30th king of the Silla Kingdom, reformed women‚Äôs clothing in 664 AD. As an adaptation from the original model, the wonsam gradually evolved into a distinctive form characteristic of traditional Korean clothing. Today the wonsam is worn primarily in representations of Joseon royal ceremonies and as a wedding garment, and in a much simplified version when performing traditional Korean dances.Hanbok Korean Overseas Information ServiceDongnae Gomu(Dongnae Drum Dance) Busan Folklore Conservation Association  Gallery  File:Korea- Hanbok-Queen-01.jpgNokwonsam (green wonsam) for a princessTraditional Korean Wedding Dress to be Exhibited at Smithsonian Museum File:Korea-Hanbok- Queen-02.jpgNokwonsam exhibited at Asian Art Museum of San Francisco File:Korean.dance-Taepyeongmu-01.jpgDancers in wonsam performing a Korean dance, Taepyeongmu  See also  *Dangui *Hwarot *Gache *List of Korean clothing  References  Category:Joseon dynasty Category:Korean clothing ","title":"Wonsam"},{"id":"21531536","title":"Marc Saw Nelson"},{"id":"21531549","text":"Return on investment (ROI) is a ratio between net profit (over a period) and cost of investment (resulting from an investment of some resources at a point in time). A high ROI means the investment's gains compare favourably to its cost. As a performance measure, ROI is used to evaluate the efficiency of an investment or to compare the efficiencies of several different investments.\\"Return On Investment ‚Äì ROI\\", Investopedia as accessed 8 January 2013 In economic terms, it is one way of relating profits to capital invested.  Purpose  In business, the purpose of the return on investment (ROI) metric is to measure, per period, rates of return on money invested in an economic entity in order to decide whether or not to undertake an investment. It is also used as an indicator to compare different investments within a portfolio. The investment with the largest ROI is usually prioritized, even though the spread of ROI over the time period of an investment should also be taken into account. Recently, the concept has also been applied to scientific funding agencies‚Äô (e.g., National Science Foundation) investments in research of open source hardware and subsequent returns for direct digital replication. ROI and related metrics provide a snapshot of profitability, adjusted for the size of the investment assets tied up in the enterprise. ROI is often compared to expected (or required) rates of return on money invested. ROI is not time- adjusted (unlike e.g. net present value): most textbooks describe it with a \\"Year 0\\" investment and two to three years' income. Marketing decisions have an obvious potential connection to the numerator of ROI (profits), but these same decisions often influence assets‚Äô usage and capital requirements (for example, receivables and inventories). Marketers should understand the position of their company and the returns expected. In a survey of nearly 200 senior marketing managers, 77 percent responded that they found the \\"return on investment\\" metric very useful. Return on investment may be extended to terms other than financial gain. For example, social return on investment (SROI) is a principles-based method for measuring extra-financial value (i.e., environmental and social value not currently reflected in conventional financial accounts) relative to resources invested. It can be used by any entity to evaluate the impact on stakeholders, identify ways to improve performance and enhance the performance of investments. Limitations with ROI usage As a decision tool, it is simple to understand. The simplicity of the formula allows users to freely choose variables, e.g., length of the calculation time, whether overhead cost is included, or which factors are used to calculate income or cost components. Use of ROI as an indicator for prioritizing investment projects alone can be misleading since usually the ROI figure is not accompanied by an explanation of its make-up. ROI should be accompanied by the underlying data that forms the inputs, this is often in the format of a business case. For long-term investments, the need for a Net Present Value adjustment is great and with out it the ROI is incorrect. Similar to discounted cash flow, a Discounted ROI should be used instead. One limitation associated with the traditional ROI calculation is that it does not fully \\"capture the short-term or long-term importance, value, or risks associated with natural and social capital\\" because it does not account for the environmental, social and governance performance of an organization. Without a metric for measuring the short- and long-term environmental, social and governance performance of a firm, decision makers are planning for the future without considering the extent of the impacts associated with their decisions. There are frequently separate measures for this purpose aligned with the compliance function.  Calculation  Return on investment can be calculated in different ways depending on the goal and application. The most comprehensive formula is: Return on investment (%) = (current value of investment if not exited yet + income from investment ‚àí initial investment and other expenses) / initial investment and other expenses x 100%. For a single- period review, divide the return (net profit) by the resources that were committed (investment): :return on investment = Net income / Investment :where: :Net income = gross profit ‚àí expenses. :investment = stock + + claims. or :return on investment = (gain from investment ‚àí cost of investment) / cost of investment or :return on investment = (revenue ‚àí cost of goods sold) / cost of goods sold Property Complications in calculating ROI can arise when real property is refinanced, or a second mortgage is taken out. Interest on a second, or refinanced, loan may increase, and loan fees may be charged, both of which can reduce the ROI, when the new numbers are used in the ROI equation. There may also be an increase in maintenance costs and property taxes, and an increase in utility rates if the owner of a residential rental or commercial property pays these expenses. Complex calculations may also be required for property bought with an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) with a variable escalating rate charged annually through the duration of the loan. Marketing investment Marketing not only influences net profits but also can affect investment levels too. New plants and equipment, inventories, and accounts receivable are three of the main categories of investments that can be affected by marketing decisions. According to a recent study, business partnerships with \\"micro-influencers\\" can bring a greater ROI than collaborations with big celebrities.Chidiadi, M. (2017, Mar). Influencer marketing on social media: Influencer marketing on social media: How to find the right influencer & measure your ROI. The Guardian.Retrieved from https://guardian.ng/business-services/influencer-marketing-on-social-media- how-to-find-the-right-influencer-measure-your-roi/ RoA, RoNA, RoC, and RoIC, in particular, are similar measures with variations on how 'investment' is defined.Farris, Paul W.; Neil T. Bendle; Phillip E. Pfeifer; David J. Reibstein (2010). Marketing Metrics: The Definitive Guide to Measuring Marketing Performance. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc. . The Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB) endorses the definitions, purposes, and constructs of classes of measures that appear in Marketing Metrics as part of its ongoing Common Language in Marketing Project. ROI is a popular metric for heads of marketing because of marketing budget allocation. Return on Investment helps identify marketing mix activities that should continue to be funded and which should be cut.  Return on integration (ROInt)  To address the lack of integration of the short and long term importance, value and risks associated with natural and social capital into the traditional ROI calculation, companies are valuing their environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance through an integrated management approach to reporting that expands ROI to Return on Integration. This allows companies to value their investments not just for their financial return but also the long term environmental and social return of their investments. By highlighting environmental, social and governance performance in reporting, decision makers have the opportunity to identify new areas for value creation that are not revealed through traditional financial reporting. The social cost of carbon is one value that can be incorporated into Return on Integration calculations to encompass the damage to society from greenhouse gas emissions that result from an investment. This is an integrated approach to reporting that supports Integrated Bottom Line (IBL) decision making, which takes triple bottom line (TBL) a step further and combines financial, environmental and social performance reporting into one balance sheet. This approach provides decision makers with the insight to identify opportunities for value creation that promote growth and change within an organization.

It may have occurred at the end of the year 1577 or beginning of 1578. There is limited surviving documentation on the massacre, although documents have recently been made available at the National Library of Ireland. Background According to traditional accounts, Francis Cosby (a soldier), and Robert Hartpole ‚Äì prospective English colonists in the plantation of the Queen's County (the ancient kingdom of Lo√≠gis, modern County Laois) and the King's County (the ancient kingdom of U√≠ Failghe, modern County Offaly) ‚Äì plotted to kill native Irish chieftains.

It is said to be based on a true story.Summary at Svenskfilmdatabas.se (in Swedich) Swedish Film Institute Synopsis Sven Holm and his wife Ingeborg are happily married with three children, and are about to open a shop in Stockholm. They open the shop, but Sven contracts tuberculosis, and dies. Ingeborg initially tries to run the shop by herself, but when she fails, and develops a debilitating ulcer, she turns to the poorhouse for help. The poorhouse board does not grant her enough assistance to survive outside the workhouse. She has to sell the shop and her house, and board the three children out to foster families. After some time, Ingeborg reads in a letter that her daughter, Valborg, is sick. The poorhouse can't finance a visit, but the determined Ingeborg escapes at night, and, after being chased by police, gets to see the child. When she returns to the poorhouse, the manager is furious that they must pay a fine for the trouble she caused. Later on, Ingeborg is offered a chance to see her younger son, this time with the poorhouse's approval. When the child doesn't recognize her, she is devastated. She tries to make a doll from her scarf for the child to play with, but he cries and turns to the foster mother. This hits Ingeborg so hard that she loses her sanity. She is relegated to the insane women's ward of the workhouse, cradling a plank of wood as if it was one of her children. After fifteen years, her elder son, Erik, now a sailor, visits her without knowing of his mother's psychosis. He becomes desperate when Ingeborg doesn't recognize him - but when he shows her a youthful photograph of herself, which features the inscription \\"To Erik from mother\\", her sanity returns.

Moira was also considered the queen of the Italian circus, one stage name being Moira of the Elephants. Cult movie fans know her for the many sword-and-sandal (peplum) films she starred in. Biography Raised in a family who owned the circus company Circus Orfei, Moira became the symbol of circus in Italy and attained international fame. The Circus Moira Orfei itself was founded in 1960. She was photographed in various scenes as a rider, trapeze artist, acrobat, dominatrice of elephants and trainer of doves. Her excessively garish image mirrors her eccentric and exuberant personality. It was Dino De Laurentiis who suggested that she change her name from Miranda to Moira.Una biografia online From then on, her face became an effigy of unchanging characteristics: heavy make-up with eyes coated with eyeliner, bright lipstick, an accentuated mole above the lip, hair tied in a turban. Promotional billboards were carpeted with this picture in every city that the circus stopped. She also became a film actress, acting in over forty films, from comedies to sword and sandal films (among which were many Italian crime films). Personal life Her parents were Riccardo Orfei and Violetta Arata. She married Walter Nones in 1961, and they had two children Stefano Orfei and Lara Orfei. Death On 4 August 2006, Moira Orfei suffered an ischemic stroke during a show in Gioiosa Ionica.

It is significant as an early treatment of the biogeography and floristics of the flora of Australia; for its contributions to plant systematics, including the erection of eleven currently accepted families; and for its presentation of a number of important observations on flower morphology. Background Brown had been botanist during Matthew Flinders' 1801‚Äì02 circumnavigation of Australia, and on returning in England in 1805 he was charged with publishing a flora of the continent. In 1810 he published the first volume of a Latin flora, Prodromus florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen, but this suffered from very poor sales, and Brown abandoned plans to produce further volumes. The following year Flinders began preparing his account of the voyage, and Brown was invited to contribute a botanical appendix. Brown took the opportunity to include numerous observations that must once have been intended for a second volume of his Prodromus. Content General remarks was published as Appendix III of Matthew Flinders' A Voyage to Terra Australis, and also simultaneously issued as an offprint with separate pagination. The paper begins with a brief summary of the voyage, followed by an acknowledgement of the specimen collections to which Brown was given access prior to the voyage. Brown then presents a broad summary of the floristics of the continent, noting that the proportion of dicotyledons is much smaller than would be expected in such a climate and latitude. It then provides a systematic arrangement of the Australian plants, broadly following the system presented by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle in his 1813 Th√©orie √©l√©mentaire de la botanique. Thirteen new families are erected, of which eleven remain current today. These are: Celastraceae, Casuarinaceae, Combretaceae, Cunoniaceae, Haloragidaceae, Hypoxidaceae, Loganiaceae, Pittosporaceae and Rhizophoraceae. He also divided Leguminosae (or Fabaceae, the legume family) into three; although Leguminosae has been restored, Brown had recognised what is now viewed as the fundamental division of the family, and his three families are retained as the Leguminosae subfamilies Caesalpinioideae, Mimosoideae and Faboideae. Throughout the paper, Brown makes morphological observations that have since been described by David Mabberley as \\"all brilliant and thought-provoking\\". These include the first explanation of the unusual construction of the \\"flower\\" (actually a pseudanthium) of Euphorbia; an explanation of the construction of the flowers of Eucalyptus; and observations on the venation of the petals of Asteraceae. He also expands on previous remarks on the fruits of conifers, and explains in detail his previous decision to separate the Poaceae into what are now Pooideae and Panicoideae. The paper concludes with comments on the vegetation and floristics of Australia, including comparisons with other continents. There is an interesting historical footnote in Brown's use of the term Australian throughout the paper. Although the word \\"Australia\\" had been used on occasion, this is the first known use of the adjectival form. Reception There is little information available on how the paper was received, but in an 1890 eulogy on Brown, Joseph Dalton Hooker remarked that the paper was Publication history This work has appeared in the following publications:  References Category:1814 documents Category:Botanical literature Category:Botany in Australia Category:Works by Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773) Category:Books about Australian natural history ","title":"General remarks, geographical and systematical, on the botany of Terra Australis"},{"id":"21531751","text":"The West Tennessee Railroad is a shortline railroad in the Southern U.S., connecting Corinth, Mississippi, to Fulton, Kentucky, via western Tennessee.

Marjoribanks was born in 1872 into a Scottish family and was educated in India and the United Kingdom, where he spent most of his childhood. In 1891, he passed the Indian Civil Service exam and was allocated to the Madras Presidency. He served as the home member of the Governor's executive council in the 1920s and as the acting Governor of Madras until the arrival of Governor-designate, George Frederick Stanley from England. Marjoribanks also served in the committee which investigated the problems of Tamil indentured labourers in Sri Lanka.  Early life  Norman Marjoribanks was born in India on 16 October 1872 and received his early education at Bishop Cotton's School and College, Bangalore. He received his higher education from Belfast Royal Academy, Royal University of Ireland and Trinity College, Cambridge. He passed his Indian Civil Service examinations in 1891 and was appointed as Assistant Collector and magistrate.  In the Civil Service  Marjoribanks served in Madras as Assistant Collector and Magistrate from 29 October 1893 to July 1901. In March 1900, he was appointed Officiating Under-Secretary of the Revenue Department. He served as a member on the Board of Revue and the Commissioner of Salt and Excise, Madras. He also served as the Home member in the executive council of the Governor of Madras, under George Goschen, 2nd Viscount Goschen. When Goschen's tenure came to an end, Marjoribanks was appointed acting Governor until the arrival of George Frederick Stanley.  Commission on the situation of Plantation Tamils of Ceylon  Following protests against indentured labour by activists of the Indian independence movement, the Government of India aPpointed a commission under Charles George Todhunter to investigate the condition of the plantation Tamils of Ceylon.Plantation Tamils of Ceylon, Pg 111 On 22 October 1916, the Government of Madras overruled the decision of the Indian Government and replaced Todhunter with Marjoribanks.Plantation Tamils of Ceylon, Pg 110 C. E. Low, the Secretary of the Department of Commerce and Industry, Government of India, complained to Sir George Barnes over the \\"bad behaviour\\" of the Madras Government. He suspected the abilities of Marjoribanks, saying \\"he is not quite class enough, socially and from the point of personality, to do us well\\". Barnes then conveyed his strong opposition to the India Office. However, the Governor of Madras, Lord Pentland gave Marjoribanks his full support: The Emigration Bench examined his service record and approved his candidature saying that \\"his record looks as if he is a pretty good man\\". Eventually, a delegation comprising Marjoribanks and A. K. G. Ahmad Thambi Marakkayar left for Ceylon on 19 November 1916 and spent six months gathering information from the planters and the Government of Ceylon.Plantation Tamils of Ceylon, Pg 113 The team prepared a report which was submitted at a conference held at London in May 1917. In the final report, the team pointed out the defects of the existing kangani system. But strangely, the report did not examine indentured labour on the whole. As a result, when the report was made public, it was criticized by Indian nationalists.  As Acting Governor of Madras  Marjoribanks served as the Home member in the Executive Council of Governor George Goschen. When Goschen's term came to an end in July 1929, Marjoribanks was appointed as acting Governor of Madras until the arrival of governor-designate, George Frederick Stanley from England. Marjoribanks served as Acting Governor of Madras from 29 June 1929 to 11 November 1929.  Later life  On the expiry of his term, Marjoribanks returned to England. He died in 1939 in Kent at the age of 67.  Honours  Marjoribanks was made a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire in 1919 and later promoted to a Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire.

Route description View of US 385 entering Bristol View of US 385 at the southern end of the US 36 concurrency US 385 is almost entirely a rural two-lane route. It begins at the Oklahoma state line on an overlap with US 287 (and at the west end of Oklahoma State Highway 3) and follows US 287 north through Campo and Springfield to Lamar. In that city it turns east with US 50 through Carlton to Granada, where the route turns north and finally separates from others. Communities along the route include Bristol, Sheridan Lake, Cheyenne Wells, Burlington, Wray, Holyoke, and Julesburg. US 385 turns west with US 138 in Julesburg, splitting west of the city and running northwest to the Nebraska state line. History The corridor along the eastern tier of Colorado was defined as several secondary highways in the 1910s. By 1914, the following were present: Secondary Road No. 2S from Oklahoma north to Holly, No. 9S from Cheyenne Wells north to Burlington, and No. 6S from Burlington north to Wray. No. 24S from Wray north to Julesburg and No. 25S south from Granada were added by 1916, and by 1919 the corridor had been completed with the extension of No. 9S south to near Granada and the connection of No. 25S to No. 2S via No. 33S east of Two Buttes.Colorado Department of Transportation, official highway maps: 1919, 1922, 1931, 1932, 1934, 1937, 1939, 1940, 1941, 1942, 1952, 1954, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1963, 1964, 1968, 1969. As part of a renumbering in 1923, State Highway 51 (SH 51) was assigned to the route, with one major difference: SH 51 did not follow No. 2S (which mostly became SH 89), but instead went southeast from Two Buttes to Stonington and continued by replacing No. 30S (Dallas- Canadian-Denver Highway) to the Kansas state line in the direction of Guymon, Oklahoma. (The connection in Kansas would become K-51 several years later, but the rest of the road to US 64 west of Guymon did not become Oklahoma State Highway 95 until 1953‚Äì1954.Oklahoma Department of Transportation, official highway maps: 1953, 1954.) In 1932‚Äì1934 a short extension from Julesburg north to Nebraska (mostly via present SH 11) was added to the route, taking it from border to border. At the same time, a new State Highway 166 (SH 166) was created, paralleling the Union Pacific Railroad's Overland Route from US 138 west of Julesburg northwesterly to the Nebraska line (where it connected with Nebraska Highway 27). SH 51 spent its early days as an unpaved road, except from Granada north to Road KK near Bristol, which received \\"oil process surfacing\\" in 1931‚Äì1932 when it was still part of US 50\\\\. Otherwise, paving was begun in 1941‚Äì1942 between Holyoke and Julesburg, and was completed north of Cheyenne Wells in 1957‚Äì1958. Several major realignments were made prior to paving. US 385 was realigned north of Wray in 1937‚Äì1939, leaving behind two separate sections of County Road FF and Roads 43 and 10 returning to current US 385 south of Holyoke. Soon thereafter, in 1939‚Äì1940, US 395 was realigned to bypass Idalia and Vernon to the east, leaving behind Road 9 to Idalia (now part of US 36), Roads DD and CC between Idalia and Vernon, and Road 26 back east to current US 385\\\\. In 1953 the state got rid of a large number of state highways, including the short extension of SH 51 north of Julesburg (still unpaved), all of SH 166 (also unpaved), and the entire length of SH 51 south of Granada. Except for of SH 116 east of Two Buttes, this was given back to the counties, and is now Roads M, 49, X, and 44 from Kansas (where K-51 still exists) to Walsh, Road 45 from Walsh to SH 116, and Roads 38, 21, N, 22, R, and 25 from SH 116 to Granada. (reproduced as part of the 1940 Census) (reproduced as part of the 1940 Census All of these roads remain unpaved with the exception of of Road 44 south of Walsh. US 385 was created nationally in 1958‚Äì1959. In Colorado it followed US 287 from Oklahoma to Kit Carson, US 40 east to Cheyenne Wells, SH 51 to Julesburg, and former SH 166 (paved in 1959‚Äì1960) was returned to the state highway system for the final bit into Nebraska. The remaining independent section of SH 51 was paved over the next few years and completed in 1963‚Äì1964, at which time US 385 was moved off US 287 north of Lamar. SH 51 was dropped along with other redundant state highway designations in late 1968. In the Eastern Colorado Mobility Study (2002) the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) identified US 385 as a potential connection between the Ports-to-Plains Corridor (US 287) and Heartland Expressway (SH 71 and US 385 in Nebraska). In 2004 the Colorado General Assembly defined the High Plains Highway as that part of US 385 from Cheyenne Wells north to Nebraska, along with US 40 connecting US 287 near Kit Carson with Cheyenne Wells. A more detailed study, made in 2007, recommended improving the highway to a \\"super 2\\" facility with improved roadway geometry and shoulders.

She married Tagbilaran City Councilor and businessman John Geesnell \\"Baba\\" Yap on February 5, 2011.http://www.boholchronicle.com/2011/jan/9/bared.htm The wedding was called the \\"Wedding of the Year\\" in Bohol. Yap currently works at her family business in Tagbilaran City called Bohol Tropics Resort. Term in office In her first year of term, Cajes initiated the Tri-Media Program, said to be the first in SK history in order to provide information about the Filipino youth. The said project composed of three components on the media- the internet, newspaper and radio. Various youth issues, concerns and other youth interest are tackled in the program. The first component is the www.skbohol.com,http://www.skbohol.com the first SK website in the Philippines. The second component is the quarterly publication, the SK Today. The maiden issue of SK Today was in Dec. 2005. The SK on Air,http://www.dytrbohol.com the official radio program made its first airing on April 2, 2006. Cajes attended the Plan International London Incorporated on October 8‚Äì9, 2008 in Woking, Surrey, United Kingdom, London to serve as one of the panelists to interview the applicants for the new CEO of the Plan International London.http://www.plan-uk.org As mandated by law, the first SK National Congress was held in Cebu City. It was the highest attendance in SK history according to the Malaca√±ang Presidential Management Staff. Cajes also led the Samahang Kabataan Volunteers Club to help the SK Bohol Federation for the implementation of its programs. The first batch, composed of 19 student leaders and SK chairmen from the province, were known as Bolahan. The 2nd batch of SKVC has 26 members. In December 2008, Cajes led the Sangguniang Kabtaan (SK) Kabataan Awards was created to recognize the SK leaders. Award- winning reporter and documentary host Kara Patria David http://www.gmanews.tv was the honored guest on the selection of the Sangguniang Kabataan (SK) Ten Outstanding Chairmen year 2 on Nov. 29, 2008. Awards Cajes has been honored by numerous award-giving bodies for her outstanding accomplishments as a youth leader. Incredibly attractive, Cajes has been named one of the country's \\"Twenty-five Hottest Young Personalities Under Twenty-Five\\" in 2010. She has also been the conferred as one of \\"The Outstanding Young Men\\" (TOYM) under the youth leadership category in 2010, a recognition of great prestige given by Junior Chamber International Philippines (formerly Philippine Jaycees). Moreover, Cajes was chosen as one of five recipients of 2009 \\"Outstanding Youth Leader Award\\" by the Office of the President in Malaca√±ang. Corruption charges In April 2010, Cajes was charged before the Office of the Ombudsman-Visayas in Cebu City for the lack of transparency in her various financial dealings as SK National President and for supposedly flaunting her wealth. However, Cajes denied the charges, claiming that allegations are part of a black propaganda orchestrated by their political opponents. During the SK National Congress 2010 held from July 28 to 30, 2010 in Panglao, Bohol, the participants urged Cajes to present financial statements during her term. The local newspapers in Bohol reported that the SK members claimed they already demanded for the financial report which Cajes failed to deliver. Allegedly unaccounted expenses included PhP10 million provided in 2008 by the Presidential Fund, PhP10 million given in 2009 by Department of Environment and Natural Resources, financial statements (FS) in 2008 regarding the hosting of Congress in Cebu, FS of 2009 congress held in Subic Bay, and FS of National Convention and launching of Sama-sama Para sa Kalikasan held in Bohol. The participants also insisted that Cajes should likewise render her report on the donations coming from the Philippines Charity Sweepstakes Office, Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation, Department of National Defense and other private donors such as The Bar. Her former staff Manuel Ferdinand De Erio and SK volunteer and publicist Leo Udtohan resigned after they allegedly discovered Cajes failure to present her financial statements for transparency and accountability. De Erio and Udtohan filed a complaint before the Ombudsman against Cajes on October 20, 2010.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1jBpwToRe8 They sought an immediate investigation leading to the filing of appropriate criminal and administrative charges against Cajes.http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=623093&publicationSubCategoryId;=68 In February 2013, the case against Cajes Yap was thrown out of court.

He served in the Union Army during the American Civil War, in which he was wounded twice, and was noted for his criticized performance during the 1864 Bermuda Hundred Campaign. After the conflict Wistar became a distinguished penologist and a writer. Early life and career Wistar in early life Isaac J. Wistar was born in 1827 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He received early his education at Westtown Friends' School, and then attended Haverford College. Wistar later received a Doctor of Science degree from the University of Pennsylvania. Wistar began practicing as a lawyer in Philadelphia. In 1849, he moved to California in order to participate as a miner in the Gold Rush.Warner, 568. From then until the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, Wistar held a great variety of vocations. Among these were: animal trapper, mountaineer, Indian fighter, farmer, and lawyer.Eicher, p. 577. Civil War service At the beginning of the American Civil War in 1861, Wistar chose to follow his home state and the Union cause. He raised a company of men and was elected its captain. Wistar's company was added to the 71st Pennsylvania Infantry, originally known as the California Regiment. This regiment was organized at Fort Schuyler in New York. On June 28, Wistar was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel, and on July 1 the 71st left for Fortress Monroe on the Virginia Peninsula. On July 22, Wistar and the 71st was then ordered to Washington, D.C., forming part of the capital's defenses until that fall. Wistar participated in the much-publicized Union defeat in the Battle of Ball's Bluff on October 21. In the fight, he temporarily led the regiment and was seriously wounded, hit in his right elbow, his jaw, and thigh. Wistar as a colonel in the Union Army Following the death of Col. Edward D. Baker at Ball's Bluff, Wistar became the commander of the 71st Pennsylvania, and was promoted to colonel on November 11, 1861. The 71st participated in the Peninsular Campaign of 1862, although it isn't clear whether Wistar was actually present; at the Battle of Seven Pines (May 31 and June 1) the regiment was led by its major, and during the Seven Days Battles (June 30 and July 1) commanded by its lieutenant colonel. Wistar fought in the Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862, and was wounded in his left arm. His commander, Oliver O. Howard, reported on Wistar's new injuries, saying \\"... with his right arm nearly useless from a former wound, had his left disabled,\\" referring to the previous Ball's Bluff wounds. On November 29 Wistar was promoted to brigadier general, and he was assigned to brigade command in the VII Corps beginning on May 16, 1863.Eicher, p. 577. Reserve Corps, VII Corps, May 13‚ÄìJune 1863; Wistar's B, VII Corps, June‚ÄìJuly 18, 1863. Beginning on July 18, 1863, Wistar commanded the District of Yorktown in Virginia, and that August the post was re-designated as a subdistrict of the Department of Virginia and North Carolina. In April 1864, he briefly was given divisional command of the XVIII in the Army of the James.Eicher, p. 577. 2nd D, XVIII Corps, April 22‚ÄìMay 7, 1864. On May 7, Wistar resumed leading a brigade and participated in the Bermuda Hundred Campaign, but 11 days later he was relieved of duty and replaced by Col. Griffen Stedman.Warner, 569. Military historian Ezra J. Warner surmises Wistar performed poorly during this campaign: Wistar's resignation from the Union Army was accepted by the U.S. War Department on September 15, 1864. Postbellum career Wistar resumed his law practice in Philadelphia, and he also was a noted penologist. He served as vice president of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, leading its coal and canal components. Wistar founded the Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology at the University of Pennsylvania in 1892, and also served as Inspector of the Pennsylvania State Penitentiary, both located in Philadelphia. He also served as president of the Pennsylvania State Board of Charities, the American Philosophical Society, and the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia. Wistar authored several works, including an autobiography and writings about war and penology. He retired in 1903 and died two years later at his summer home in Claymont, New Castle County, Delaware. Mount Wistar in Greenland was named after him by Robert Peary in his 1898-1902 expedition. ;Selected works * Prison System of Pennsylvania (1900)Isaac Jones Wistar, \\"Prison System of Pennsylvania,\\" in 56th Congress, U.S. House of Representatives, Document 566, Prison Systems of the United States (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1900), pp. 112-118. * Autobiography of Isaac Jones Wistar, 1827-1905 (1905) * Half a Century in War and Peace (1914, posthumous) Personal Wistar married Sarah Toland (1838-1895) in 1863, but the couple were childless.Richard Wistar Davids, Wistar Family: A Genealogy of the Descendants of Caspar Wistar, Emigrant in 1717 (Philadelphia: by the author, 1896), p. 13.

The unit was created in 1967 following a request from the United States military for Australia to send more helicopter pilots to the conflict. As the only available personnel were from the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) Fleet Air Arm (with Australian Army and RAAF pilots already heavily committed), the RAN Helicopter Flight Vietnam (RANHFV) was formed and integrated into the 135th Assault Helicopter Company of the United States Army. The EMU unit name was selected by the Americans as a backronym for the Australian bird, a choice which amused the Australians: despite being large, fast, and highly mobile, the emu cannot fly. The EMU flew multiple variants of the UH-1 Iroquois helicopter, and was primarily tasked with providing transport and support for units of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), United States Army and Marine Corps, and Australian Army. A typical day's operations consisted of ten transports (supported by four gunships and a command unit) collecting a unit of soldiers, performing a combat assault, then returning the unit to base. Other operations included dawn and dusk assaults, night hunter-killer patrols, and supporting United States Navy SEAL units in the capture of senior Viet Cong personnel. Although the RAN contingent was significantly smaller than the rest of the unit, the Australian personnel frequently found themselves in senior positions, due to having more extensive training and experience than their American counterparts. Initially operating out of Vung Tau, the EMU was relocated to the Xu√¢n L·ªôc district at the end of 1967. In late 1968, the unit was moved to near Bi√™n H√≤a. In mid-1970, the EMU was tasked to operations into Cambodia, but as the rules of engagement for the Australians forbade them from operating outside Vietnam, the unit operated under-strength for several days until being retasked back to Vietnam operations. Later that year, the unit was relocated to ƒê·ªìng T√¢m. The RANHFV was withdrawn from Vietnam in 1971, ending the joint unit. The Australian contingent was the most heavily decorated RAN unit to serve in the Vietnam War, and the one with the highest casualty rate. Organisation and role Fleet Air Arm Museum in 2015 The EMU was formed around the US Army's 135th Assault Helicopter Company.ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 180 The 135th had previously flown Caribou transports as a tactical air transport company, but was reoriented for helicopters following the Johnson- McConnell agreement of 1966, when all fixed-wing aircraft were transferred to the United States Air Force and all rotary-wing aircraft to the United States Army. The 135th was integrated with the Royal Australian Navy Helicopter Flight Vietnam, an Australian contingent of eight pilots, four observers, four aircrew, 24 technical sailors and mechanics, and six administrative personnel, all drawn from 723 Squadron RAN. Four of these contingents were deployed during the Australian participation in the joint unit (RANHFV 1 through 4).Farthing, Sea power ashore and in the air, p. 214. The Australian officer in charge of the RAN contingent became the executive officer of the 135th Company, and because of their more extensive training and experience when compared to the American personnel (for example, one US Army flying instructor assigned to the company had only 125 hours flying experience, while each RAN pilot had over 1,000 hours), Australian personnel commonly filled out leadership positions throughout the company.Farthing, Sea power ashore and in the air, pp. 214‚Äì5, 220. The collective name for the combined unit was the Experimental Military Unit, or EMU.ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 181 The name was a backronym for emu, and was selected by the 135th before their deployment for being a large, fast, and highly mobile Australian bird. The designation amused Australian members of the company, because emus cannot fly. The EMU was officially part of 12th Aviation Group, 1st Aviation Brigade, and was part of the US Army chain of command.Farthing, Sea power ashore and in the air, p. 219. A separate chain of command for RAN personnel was maintained to the Commander Australian Forces Vietnam. The Australian command chain was rarely used: David Farthing, who led RANHFV 3, claims he only had to use it once during his twelve-month deployment. The main role of the EMU was to provide transport and support for units of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), United States Army and Marine Corps, and Australian Army.Farthing, in Sea power ashore and in the air, p. 216 For this purpose, the company was equipped with UH-1 Iroquois helicopters: 30 UH-1D or UH-1H 'Slick' troop-carrying helicopters (the EMU was the first Assault Helicopter Company to be equipped with the 'H' model), and eight UH-1C gunship helicopters (nicknamed Taipans, after the venomous Australian snake).Naval Operations in Vietnam, Royal Australian Navy.ANAM, Flying Stations, pp. 180‚Äì1 The company was divided up into five platoons: two troop transport, one gunship, one maintenance, and one headquarters. A typical daily deployment consisted of ten Slicks (plus a spare), two teams of two gunships, and a Command and Control helicopter (designated 'Charley Charley').ANAM, Flying Stations, pp. 182‚Äì3 The helicopters would depart base at dawn, collect a unit (typically from the United States 9th Infantry Division, the United States 199th Infantry Brigade, the South Vietnamese III and IV Corps, or the 1st Australian Task Force), perform a combat assault, then return the unit to their base before dark.ANAM, Flying Stations, pgs. 182‚Äì3, 188 Other duties performed by the EMU, particularly from 1970 onwards, included dawn and dusk assaults; night hunter- killer patrols, which consisted of one Slick armed with flares, two gunships, and a Charley Charley armed with a high-power searchlight and a twin 0.50 calibre machinegun; and joint operations with the United States Navy SEALs, which typically involved locating and capturing senior Viet Cong personnel.Farthing, Sea power ashore and in the air, pp. 216‚Äì7. History Creation In 1966, the United States requested that Australia send more helicopter pilots to Vietnam, as the increase in the number of US and allied soldiers had increased beyond the capability of helicopter transport and support units.ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 179 Because of Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) commitments in Vietnam and elsewhere, the only available pilots were from the RAN Fleet Air Arm. It was originally intended to integrate them with the Royal Australian Air Force's No. 9 Squadron, although the United States Army requested that the RAN pilots be integrated with one of their helicopter companies. On 14 July 1967, it was announced that the RAN Helicopter Flight Vietnam (RANHFV) would be created and combined with the US Army's 135th Assault Helicopter Company to form the Experimental Military Unit (EMU). October 1967 ‚Äì September 1968 The components of the EMU arrived in Vung Tau during early October 1967: the 135th during the first week, and the RANHFV contingent during 16‚Äì18 October. The company was declared operational on 3 November 1967. The company operated from Vung Tau during November and December, then was relocated to Blackhorse Camp (operating base of the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment) in the Xu√¢n L·ªôc district on 31 December.ANAM, Flying Stations, pp. 183‚Äì4 In mid-February, while delivering the 9th Division to a landing zone near M·ªπ Tho, the EMU encountered multiple companies of heavily armed North Vietnamese soldiers.ANAM, Flying Stations, pp. 185‚Äì6 One helicopter was shot down by a rocket, killing the American aircrew, and eight other aircraft were damaged. On 22 February 1968, a RAN EMU pilot was killed while leading a mission to extract South Vietnamese soldiers from a Viet Cong assault.Cooper, in The Royal Australian Navy, p. 208. He was the first Australian pilot to be killed in the Vietnam War. A program started in late February, where pilots from No. 9 Squadron RAAF were invited to fly with the EMU for two-week stints: although officially conceived to promote knowledge-sharing between the Royal Australian Navy, Royal Australian Air Force, and the United States Army aviation branch, the plan also helped counteract pilot shortages in the EMU as United States personnel completed their twelve-month draft period and were not immediately replaced.ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 186 On 18 May, the EMU was assigned to transport the South Vietnamese 25th Division.ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 187 During the landing, the force was ambushed by Viet Cong soldiers: ten aircraft were hit and several South Vietnamese were killed or wounded, although the only injury suffered by EMU aircrew was a bullet through the earlobe of an American pilot. It was later found that the attack resulted from an intelligence leak within the South Vietnamese unit, resulting in a tightening of procedures and the creation of 'Smoky'; an Iroquois modified to generate a smoke screen during landings.ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 188 On 21 August, a gunship was struck by a rocket and crashed, killing the three aircrew.ANAM, Flying Stations, pp. 188‚Äì9 Starting from 9 September, the second RANHFV contingent was rotated in, with the EMU's Australian Executive Officer relieved on 30 September, and the last members of the first contingent departing on 15 October.ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 189 During RANHFV 1's deployment, the EMU had flown 30,670 hours, with seven American and three Australian aircrew killed, plus eleven Americans and four Australians seriously injured. October 1968 ‚Äì September 1969 On 23 October, the EMU met heavy resistance near B·∫øn Tre while performing insertions and extractions of the 9th Division. Two helicopters crashed and were destroyed, and another seven damaged, but there were no aircrew casualties. From November, the EMU was assigned to operate from Bear Cat Camp (operating base of the 222nd Aviation Battalion) near Bi√™n H√≤a, at the same time as their duties expanded to include supporting Royal Thai Army forces.Dennis et al, The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History, p. 441 In January 1969, a RAN pilot was killed when his helicopter made contact with power lines during bad weather.ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 191 In mid-February, a gunship was shot down in Vƒ©nh Long by a Viet Cong force. The aircrew survived, and used the gunship's door-mounted M60 machine guns to keep the Viet Cong soldiers at bay until another EMU helicopter could rescue them. The Viet Cong commenced sporadic mortar attacks on Bear Cat on 22 February, forcing the EMU to evacuate their helicopters and support personnel to Blackhorse six times over the next seven days. On 31 May, an EMU gunship escorting a formation near ƒê·ªìng T√¢m came under heavy fire and crashed, killing all aboard. Door Gunner, Leading Aircrewman Noel Shipp, the only Australian in the crew, continued to fire as the helicopter hit the ground and was later honored with a Recruit Division in his name at the RAN, Recruit School. On 16 June, an Australian gunner aboard a Slick was wounded while providing covering fire for a medical evacuation of South Vietnamese soldiers near C√°i B√®. Despite the start of the wet season in June, North Vietnamese activity increased. This, combined with the loss of several helicopters and the replacement of the US 9th Infantry Division with the less professional South Vietnamese 7th and 9th Divisions as part of the 'Vietnamization' process, increased the EMU's workload.ANAM, Flying Stations, pp. 192‚Äì3 RANHFV 3 began to rotate in from 10 September, and was completed by late September. October 1969 ‚Äì September 1970 On 19 December, following a Viet Cong ambush in B√¨nh ƒê·∫°i which killed half of a South Vietnamese unit, the EMU successfully deployed a blocking force in the path of the North Vietnamese withdrawal, which inflicted heavy casualties.ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 193 Several helicopters were shot down and crew chiefs killed or wounded during operations in the first months of 1970.ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 194 Around the same time, the replacement of South Vietnamese commanders with more aggressive officers in the units the EMU operated with, a desire to prevent North Vietnam from launching another Tet Offensive-like attack, and the commencement of night-time hunter-killer patrols dramatically increased the EMU's workload. This was compounded by shortages in new American personnel to replace those who had completed their draft, spare parts, and aircraft, forcing the EMU to borrow helicopters and aircrew from other units. In early March, an EMU helicopter landed on a booby trap, seriously wounding the Australian pilot and killing two South Vietnamese passengers. Later that month, an American gunship crewman died from wounds received from enemy fire, while in a separate incident, five Slicks were damaged by gunfire. At the start of May 1970, the EMU was marked to lead operations into Cambodia. However, as Australian personnel were forbidden by their rules of engagement from entering Cambodia, a point reinforced by the Australian Embassy the night before the first operation, the EMU was forced to operate without Australian personnel for several days, until they were reassigned to duties in Vietnam.Farthing, in Sea power ashore and in the air, p. 215 The commitment of other helicopter units to the Cambodian campaign further increased the EMU workload. On 18 May, a South Vietnamese outpost was overrun by a Viet Cong battalion.ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 195 The EMU was called in to drop counterattacking troops into the area; during this the Australian-manned lead helicopter was damaged and had to withdraw. Another EMU helicopter was diverted from other operations to lead the insertions. The second leader received cockpit instrument damage from enemy fire, although the Australian pilot remained on station for several more waves. The pilot, Sub- Lieutenant Andy Perry, was later awarded the United States Silver Star, the South Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry, and was mentioned in despatches. Two days later, an EMU gunship crashed after being fired on by a .50 caliber machine gun, killing the American aircrew, while its companion was heavily damaged. By the end of May, the shortage of United States personnel had been addressed, with the company brought back to full strength. However, the gunship platoon was down several helicopters, a situation that remained unaddressed as the UH-1C gunship was no longer in production, and the replacement, the AH-1 Cobra, had not been deployed to frontline units. In August, the EMU was relocated to a base at ƒê·ªìng T√¢m, which also housed elements of the United States Navy SEALs and the Mobile Riverine Force. Although closer to the unit's normal operating areas (an advantage which was negated when the 21st Division, operating in the Mekong Delta began to require EMU support), the base was regularly subjected to mortar and rocket attacks (in the first month, the base was mortared on average once a week).ANAM, Flying Stations, pp. 195‚Äì6 The EMU was required to relocate completely within four days while continuing operations. The Royal Australian Navy rotation from RANHFV 3 to RANHFV 4 occurred during September, with the EMU executive officer position formally handed over on 17 September.ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 196 October 1970 ‚Äì June 1971 Attacks on the base continued throughout October and November; five EMU personnel were wounded by mortar shrapnel on 3 November. On 11 November, the EMU was required to drop four waves of South Vietnamese soldiers into an engagement with a Viet Cong battalion near U Minh. During this, five aircraft were damaged, one of which was forced to land, but later recovered. The vulnerability of the UH-1 Iroquois was demonstrated in late 1970, when five EMU helicopters were shot down in the Kien Hoa province by a single Viet Cong soldier armed with an AK-47 rifle.Farthing, Sea power ashore and in the air, p. 218. Nobody was killed in the resulting crashes, but all five helicopters had to be airlifted out by CH-47 Chinooks. On 4 December, an Australian EMU pilot rescued a South Vietnamese patrol boat, which had been disabled and was drifting towards the Viet Cong force that had attacked it and sunk a companion craft.ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 197RAN Helicopter Flight Vietnam, Royal Australian Navy Despite coming under fire, the pilot achieved this by entangling his Iroquois' landing skids in the boat's superstructure and towing it away. He was later awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his actions. Operations continued into the new year, and on 16 January 1971 an EMU helicopter was shot down, crashing upside-down. The American pilot was killed, but the other personnel survived the crash, linked up with South Vietnamese troops fighting in the area, and remained with them until helicopters of the 1st Cavalry Regiment drove the North Vietnamese off. During late February and early March, South Vietnamese and American forces were involved in Operation Lam Son 719, an attempt to cut North Vietnamese supply lines (known as the Ho Chi Minh trail in Laos. Because of the Australian contingent, the EMU did not participate in this operation, but found that American pilots and aircrew intended for the unit to replace draft completers were instead being diverted to helicopter companies supporting the operation. Early in 1971, it was announced that the RANHFV would be one of several Australian units to withdraw from Vietnam by mid-1971. The Australian personnel of the EMU ceased flying operations on 8 June, and departed on 16 June, marking the end of the joint-force Experimental Military Unit. Awards and honours The Australian personnel received a number of honours and decorations: three were appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE), eight received the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC), five the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC), and one received the British Empire Medal (BEM).ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 199 24 were Mentioned in Despatches, and 34 received Naval Board Commendations. This was over half of the honours and awards presented to RAN personnel serving in the Vietnam War. Australian personnel were also awarded several Vietnamese and United States decorations. 723 Squadron RAN, the parent unit of the RAN Helicopter Flight Vietnam, was awarded the battle honour \\"Vietnam 1967‚Äì71\\". Five RAN personnel assigned to the EMU were killed during the conflict, with another ten seriously injured: the highest casualty rate of any RAN unit in Vietnam.Hobbs, in Oldham, 100 Years of the Royal Australian Navy, p. 145 In 2018, the Australian government awarded the Helicopter Flight Vietnam a Unit Citation for Gallantry, which was presented at a ceremony held at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra.White, Tribute to a special unit, p. 9 Citations References ;Books  ;Websites * * ;Newspaper articles * Further reading * External links * Huey Vets ‚Äì EMU Inc.: a non-profit organisation promoting the history of the EMU and Vietnam helicopter units in general, primarily through the operation of an airworthy replica of an EMU helicopter.

Three Grand Touring models including the GT380 and GT750 and were originally offered for sale with the beginning of the 1972 model year (MY) with the 550 called \\"Indy\\" for the North American market. In Suzuki's numbering scheme, automobile race tracks identify each of its 3-cylinder GT bikes for the North America market: Sebring for the 380, Indy for the 550 and Le Mans for the 750. Ram air system The 550 (and the 380) have a ram-air cooling system for the one-piece cylinder head. Two- stroke engines lose power after the engine reaches its critical temperature, so Suzuki used a system from its 500 cc two stroke twin cylinder racer, the T500. This system consisted of a two piece aluminum shroud bolted to the cylinder head to duct ambient air over the cylinder head finning. The centre part of the head had an increased fin area and a larger shroud entry area in an effort to keep the centre cylinder running at the same temperature as the naturally more exposed outboard cylinders.GT550 Owner's Manual Suzuki Part #99011-34611 Visible emissions control Suzuki Recycle Injection System (SRIS) was an attempt by the manufacturer to reduce visible emissions from a two stroke motorcycle. The SRIS consisted of a small check valve in the bottom of each crank chamber along with various lengths of elastomeric tubing to the transfer ports of adjacent cylinders. See the attached diagram for a graphic depiction of the system. Two stroke engines have a tendency to collect unburnt oil and fuel in the bottom of the crank chamber at idle. Upon acceleration, after a period of idling, the unburned oil and fuel gets sucked up the transfer ports and contributes to an overrich mixture for the first 5 to 10 seconds resulting in a smokescreen from the exhaust. The SRIS plumbing routed the unburned fuel and oil to the next cylinder in the firing order thus allowing it to mix more thoroughly with the incoming charge of that cylinder and lowering the production of visible smoke. Overall fuel and oil consumption was unchanged but visible smoke was greatly reduced on sudden acceleration from rest.Suzuki GT750 Service Manual Part #SR-3100 dtd. 07/72 Exhaust system The exhaust itself was unusual for the time in that the centre exhaust header was split in two and exited into two mufflers much smaller than the single mufflers supplied for the two outboard cylinders. This gave a bike a balanced look with two mufflers per side. The header pipes were all joined via balance tubes, known as Exhaust Coupler Tube System (ECTS), to increase low end torque. This exhaust was continued through to the end of production for the North American market but was dropped from the M model onwards in some other markets. Automatic oil/fuel mixing Suzuki began using automatic lubrication in 1966 to eliminate premixing of oil and fuel as had been the norm for all two strokes up until then. This system was launched to eliminate mixtures with far too much oil due to the operator's unnecessary effort to preclude engine seizures. The 550 had the latest version of this multipoint oil injection called Crankcase Cylinder Injection (CCI). Undersquare engine The 550 was designed to be suited as a touring motorcycle with its long wheelbase and unstressed torquey engine. The engine will pull quite easily from ~3,500 RPM. The smaller bore/longer stroke dimensions allow quick burning of the air fuel mixture, allowing the use of regular grade fuel. This type of undersquare engine configuration has long since been discarded for use in street bikes by most Japanese motorcycle engine designers due to its inherent limitations on power increases and the recent advances in combustion chamber design allowing the use of large bore cylinders and high compression without detonation issues.  Model year changes   1972 J model The GT550 introductory model was Suzuki's counter to the Kawasaki H1 Mach III. The GT550 had a massive four leading shoe double panel drum front brake shared with the GT750. The conventional telescopic front forks had rubber gaiters covering the fork stanchions. Both fenders were chromed steel. Chrome and polished aluminum were used on the rest of the bike. The fuel cap was, unusually for the times, lockable and this was carried on through to the end of production. The rear turn signal lenses were red. Engine cooling was by the Ram Air system. First year sales were 11,000+ units.U.S. Suzuki Service Publication #3 dtd. 03/25/94  1973 K model A single hydraulically operated front disc brake was added in 1973. Otherwise the bike was the same as the previous model, excepting the annual paint scheme change. Both the wheel and the other fork leg were capable of accepting another disc and caliper and a switch to a twin-disc front brake (like the GT750) was not an uncommon modification some owners made (although the larger master cylinder from the 750 was required). The single disc arrangement continued throughout the rest of the GT550's production. The brake light operated only by the rear brake in the UK market. A switch was available as a spare part to fit onto the front brake master cylinder casting which would also operate the brake light. The necessary wiring was already included on the main wiring harness in the headlamp shell. Sales were 14,000+ in 1973.  1974 L model  The rubber- gaiters were replaced by a cleaned up \\"Ceriani-style\\" set of forks. A touted benefit was better engine cooling but, with ram air, this was a non-issue for the most part. The three separate carburetors were replaced by three unitized rack mounted carburetors with a push-pull cable arrangement. The benefits of this were less costly carburetor balancing and more accurate fuel metering. The handlebar mounted cable operated choke was gone, replaced by a lever mounted directly on the left hand side of the carb rack. Curiously, only 2 enricheners were used leaving the right hand cylinder without one. The cylinder head and the ram air shroud were redesigned to cater for this new carb setup. A new airbox and filter assembly had bright chrome end caps and filter servicing was easier. The frame side covers were all new as well to blend in with the lines of the airbox end caps. The chain guard was chromed steel instead of black plastic. The instrument cluster still contained the speedometer and tachometer but a single digit LED gear indicator was added. It was in the centre of the instrument panel showing gear numbers 1 through 5 in a bright red colour. The neutral light indicator was retained as a separate item. Sales were 10,000+.  1975 M model  In 1975, various external and internal parts of the fork were changed, the engine was re-tuned to 53 hp now with chrome bores plated directly onto the alloy barrels and the bike was heavily restyled. This type of styling ran through to the model end in 1977 with only minor changes. Problems with the starter clutch engaging while riding and thus locking up the engine were solved with the substitution of a Borg-Warner style starter clutch installed under warranty. This style of starter clutch was standard equipment on all later models. The Exhaust Coupler Tube System (ECTS) link between the exhaust pipes disappeared in some markets outside of North America. The North American area kept the exhaust coupler tubes and older engine tune of 50HP with cast iron cylinder liners through to the end of production. Available in Green and Red in UK. This MY sales were 14,000+.  1976 A model Ram air cooling shroud on top of the cylinder head In 1976 the front mudguard stay was removed. Petrol Tank Graphics swooped up at the front. Available in Red and Black. The rear shocks were stiffened. The gear indicator changed to LED segments rather than the previous dot matrix. This MY sales were 9,000+.  1977 B model  The faces of the speedometer and tachometer were changed from a blue background to brown to match the appearance of the instruments on the GS models. There was also a change in the plastic used as lens because it no longer developed serious opacity and cracks after long exposure to sunlight. The instruments did not get the then-unique rose-colored backlighting that the GS models had. The front brake caliper was changed to a pivoting unit made by Asco rather than the fixed Tokico caliper that had been supplied from the introduction of the disc brake system. The GT and GS series were sold side by side during this one year overlap. This was the last MY for GT550 production. This MY sales were ~6,000+ making this the rarest of all the 550 models. Reception A January 1973 Cycle World road test said the GT-550K Indy was a good compromise between the GT750 Watercooled and the GT380, with substantial enough weight and size for to long-distance touring with a passenger, and being only just light enough and narrow enough, with a ground clearance for \\"deft canyon road maneuvering or hustling through traffic\\". They tested the bike's top speed at and acceleration at in 5.8 seconds or in 14.59 seconds at . Braking from was tested at .

Rather than being a cross between two entirely separate systems, democratic republics may function on principles shared by both republics and democracies. Theory Common definitions of the terms democracy and republic often feature overlapping concerns, suggesting that many democracies function as republics, and many republics operate on democratic principles, as shown by these definitions from the Oxford English Dictionary: * Republic: \\"A state in which supreme power is held by the people and their elected representatives...\\" * Democracy: \\"A system of government by the whole population or all the eligible members of a state, typically through elected representatives.\\" Eugene Volokh of the UCLA School of Law notes that the United States exemplifies the varied nature of a constitutional republica country where some decisions (often local) are made by direct democratic processes, while others (often federal) are made by democratically elected representatives. As with many large systems, US governance is incompletely described by any single term. It also employs the concept, for instance, of a constitutional democracy in which a court system is involved in matters of jurisprudence. As with other democracies, not all persons in a democratic republic are necessarily citizens, and not all citizens are necessarily entitled to vote. Suffrage is commonly restricted by criteria such as voting age. and sometimes by felony or imprisonment status.  History  In the US, the notion that a republic was a form of democracy was common from the time of its founding, and the concepts associated with representative democracy (and hence with a democratic republic) are suggested by John Adams (writing in 1784): > No determinations are carried, it is true, in a simple representative > democracy, but by consent of the majority or their representatives. Historically, some inconsistency around the term is frequent. China claims to be the oldest of Asia's democratic republics, though its recent history of democratic process is largely linked only to Taiwan. Likewise, Africa's oldest democratic republic, Liberia (formed in 1822), has had its political stability rocked by periodic violence and coups.  Global use of the term  Many countries that use the term \\"democratic republic\\" in their official names (such as Algeria, Congo-Kinshasa, Ethiopia, North Korea, Laos, and Nepal) are considered undemocratic \\"hybrid regimes\\" or \\"authoritarian regimes\\" by the Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index and \\"not free\\" by the U.S.-based, U.S.-government-funded non-governmental organization Freedom House. In addition, East Germany was also officially known as the German Democratic Republic, but, like the Somali Democratic Republic, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, was controlled by a bureaucratic government espousing Marxism‚ÄìLeninism. Incidentally, the Democratic Republic of Madagascar and the Democratic Republic of the Sudan were non-Marxist socialist states that existed during the Cold War. There are also countries which use the term \\"Democratic Republic\\" in the name and have a good track of general election and were rated \\"flawed democracy\\" or \\"full democracy\\" in the Democracy Index, such as the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, the Democratic Republic of S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe and the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.

Seven \\"debate\\" topics are known from the Sumerian literature, falling in the category of 'disputations'; some examples are: The Debate between Winter and Summer; Debate between sheep and grain; the Tree and the Reed; bird and fish; and The Dispute between Silver and Mighty Copper, etc.Kramer, The Sumerians: Their History, Culture and Character, p. 218. These topics came some centuries after writing was established in Sumerian Mesopotamia. The debates are philosophical and address humanity's place in the world. Some of the debates may be from 2100 BC. The bird and fish debate is a 190-line text of cuneiform script. It begins with a discussion of the gods having given Mesopotamia and dwelling places for humans; for water for the fields, the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, and the marshes, marshland, grazing lands for humans, and the birds of the marshes, and fish are all given.ETCSL ext link, lines 1-18-(3 small paragraphs-English) The debate then begins starting with Fish addressing Bird. The debate, in short summary Fish speaks first The initial speech of Fish:ETCSL, portions of lines 19-190 :\\"...Bird...there is no insult, ..! Croaking ...noise in the marshes ...squawking! Forever gobbling away greedily, while your heart is dripping with evil! Standing on the plain you can keep pecking away until they chase you off! The farmer's sons lay lines and nets for you..(and continues)..You cause damage in the vegetable plots..(more)..Bird, you are shameless: you fill the courtyard with your droppings. The courtyard sweeper-boy who cleans the house chases after you...(etc)\\" The 2nd and 3rd paragraphs continue: :\\"They bring you into the fattening shed. They let you moo like cattle, bleat like sheep. They pour out cool water in jugs for you. They drag you away for the daily sacrifice.\\" (the 2nd, 3rd paragraphs continue for several lines) Bird's initial retort Bird replies: :\\"How has your heart become so arrogant, while you yourself are so lowly? Your mouth is flabby(?), but although your mouth goes all the way round, you can not see behind you. You are bereft of hips, as also of arms, hands and feet - try bending your neck to your feet! Your smell is awful; you make people throw-up; they sneer at you! ....\\" Bird continues: :\\"But I am the beautiful and clever Bird! Fine artistry went into my adornment. But no skill has been expended on your holy shaping! Strutting about in the royal palace is my glory; my warbling is considered a decoration in the courtyard.

The plebiscite was held on December 13, 2008, and the result was a slight majority rejecting the creation of the province. Gumaca would have been the capital of Quezon del Sur, while Lucena would have been retained as Quezon del Norte's capital. Both provinces would have remained part of the Calabarzon Region (Southern Tagalog, Region-4A) under their original acronym \\"ZON\\" (Quezon).newsinfo.inquirer.net, January polls to decide division of Quezon Referendum question The Quezon del Sur creation plebiscite was supervised and officiated by the COMELEC pursuant to Resolution No. 8553.

Background In 1992, Republic Act No. 9495 was proposed to further divide Quezon into Quezon del Norte and Quezon del Sur. Quezon del Norte was to be composed of the first and second congressional districts of the province (Burdeos, General Nakar, Infanta, Jomalig, Lucban, Mauban, Pagbilao, Panukulan, Patnanungan, Polillo, Real, Sampaloc, Tayabas, Candelaria, Dolores, San Antonio, Sariaya, Tiaong and Lucena City), with Lucena City as its capital. Quezon del Sur, with its capital at Gumaca, would have been composed of the third and fourth congressional districts (Agdangan, Buenavista, Catanauan, General Luna, Macalelon, Mulanay, Padre Burgos, Pitogo, San Andres, San Francisco, San Narciso, Unisan, Alabat, Atimonan, Calauag, Guinayangan, Gumaca, Lopez, Perez, Plaridel, Quezon and Tagkawayan). The act lapsed into law without the signature of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo on September 7, 2007. As required by law, the COMELEC held a plebiscite on December 13, 2008, 60 days after Republic Act No. 9495 took effect. Gov. Rafael Nantes, one of the original authors of the law, and Vice Gov. Carlos Portes, opposed the division of the province. Board member Sonny Pulgar and businessman Hobart Dator Jr. launched the \\"Save Quezon Province Movement.\\" The Comelec allotted P 50 million for the plebiscite. Academician Prof. Joseph Jadway \\"JJ\\" Marasigan provided what he called the \\"strong theoretical framework\\" that deemed the said split as a step backward. He instead called for the professionalization of service institutions and the differentiation of functions as the answer to the province's increasingly becoming complex environment. He organized students and fellow academicians to oppose such move. His participation resulted in a grave misunderstanding with Lucena Catholic Bishop Emilio Marquez who strongly supported the idea of splitting the province. Marasigan maintained that bishops have no business in dealing with entirely political matters and should refrain from using their influence over their flock. Gov. Rafael Nantes later softened his stand against the proposed creation of Quezon del Sur. Accordingly, upon request of Comelec Chair Jose Melo, a P38 million \\"Special Allotment Release Order\\" was issued by the Department of Budget and Management to the Commission on Elections (Philippines) to fund the holding of the plebiscite. On November 17, 2008, Save Quezon Province Movement (SQPM) asked the Supreme Court of the Philippines to declare Republic Act 9495 as unconstitutional, and to restrain the implementation of a November 12 COMELEC Resolutions Nos. 8533, 8534, 8535, 8537, 8538 and 8539, setting the plebiscite. Yet the plebiscite proceeded with the majority of votes rejecting the division, therefore the split did not push through.

It was remade in India in 1991 with the same name. The film stars Ilias Kanchan and Anju Ghosh. The original movie is also reputed to be the highest grossing Bangladeshi film of all time. Plot In the Bengali language, \\"Bede\\" means a caste or group of people who make their living by catching snakes and entertaining people by making the snakes dance to the tune of there flutes. Joytsna (Anju Ghose) is a girl from this community. One day a poisonous snake bites the foot of a local prince (Ilias Kanchan). A bede is called to cure the prince. He sees the wound and declares that only Jyotsna can extract the poison from the prince's blood. The king calls Jyotsna and asks her to save his son, in exchange for which he agrees to give her anything she wants. Jyotsna cures the prince but becomes ill in the process. After her mother and the queen pray for her, she recovers and demands the hand of the prince as her reward, but the king balks. When the prince, now recovered, comes to know of everything that has transpired, he falls in love with Jyotsna. After a long tug-of-war, the couple persuade the king to consent to their union and they marry. This story was taken from a very old rural Bengali play of the same name.

After extension this train was renumbered as 1019/1020 in the year 1994. It is one of the oldest trains connecting the eastern and western states of the country. Currently operating as 11019/11020, it connects Mumbai Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CSTM) to Bhubaneshwar (BBS).

The negotiations, which occurred during the era of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, included a two-day Berlin conference between Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov, Adolf Hitler and German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop, followed by both countries trading written proposed agreements. After two days of negotiations from 12 to 14 November 1940, Germany presented the Soviets with a draft written Axis pact agreement defining the world spheres of influence of the four proposed Axis powers (Japan, Germany, Soviet Union, Italy). Hitler, Ribbentrop and Molotov tried to set German and Soviet spheres of influence; Hitler encouraged Molotov to look south to Iran and eventually India while preserving German access to Finland's resources, and to remove Soviet influence in the Balkans.Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov Leaves Berlin after Four-Power Talks Molotov remained firm, seeking to remove German troops from Finland and gain a warm water port in the Baltic. Soviet foreign policy calculations were predicated by the idea that the war would be a long- term struggle and therefore German claims that Britain would be defeated swiftly were treated with skepticism. In addition, Stalin sought to remain influential in Bulgaria and Yugoslavia. These factors resulted in Molotov taking a firm line. According to a study by Alexander Nekrich, on 25 November 1940, the Soviets presented a Stalin-drafted written counterproposal where they would accept the four power pact, but it included Soviet rights to Bulgaria and a world sphere of influence centered on the area around Iraq and Iran. Germany did not respond, leaving the negotiations unresolved. Regarding the counterproposal, Hitler remarked to his top military chiefs that Stalin \\"demands more and more\\", \\"he's a cold-blooded blackmailer\\" and that \\"a German victory has become unbearable for Russia\\" so that \\"she must be brought to her knees as soon as possible.\\" Germany broke the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact in June 1941 by invading the Soviet Union. Background 277x277px Soviet‚ÄìGerman 1939 agreements and past hostilities During the summer of 1939, after conducting negotiations with both a British-French group and Germany regarding potential military and political agreements, the Soviet Union chose Germany, resulting in an August 19 German‚ÄìSoviet Commercial Agreement providing for the trade of certain German military and civilian equipment in exchange for Soviet raw materials. Four days later, the countries signed the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, which contained secret protocols dividing the states of Northern and Eastern Europe into German and Soviet \\"spheres of influence.\\"Text of the Nazi- Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, executed August 23, 1939 Just before the signing of the agreements, the parties had addressed past hostilities, with German Foreign Minister Joachim Ribbentrop telling Soviet diplomats that \\"there was no problem between the Baltic and the Black Sea that could not be solved between the two of us.\\"Vehvil√§inen, Olli, Finland in the Second World War: Between Germany and Russia, Macmillan, 2002, , page 30 Diplomats from the two countries addressed the common ground of anti-capitalism and anti-democracy, stating \\"there is one common element in the ideology of Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union: opposition to the capitalist democracies,\\"Bertriko, Jean- Jacques Subrenat, A. and David Cousins, Estonia: Identity and Independence, Rodopi, 2004, page 131 \\"neither we nor Italy have anything in common with the capitalist west\\" and \\"it seems to us rather unnatural that a socialist state would stand on the side of the western democracies.\\" A German official explained that their prior hostility toward Soviet Bolshevism had subsided with the changes in the Comintern and the Soviet renunciation of a world revolution. A Soviet official characterized the conversation as \\"extremely important\\". At the signing, Ribbentrop and Stalin enjoyed warm conversations, exchanging toasts and further discussing the prior hostilities between the countries in the 1930s. Ribbentrop stated that Britain had always attempted to disrupt Soviet-German relations, was \\"weak\\", and \\"wants to let others fight for her presumptuous claim to world dominion\\". Stalin concurred, adding, \\"If England dominated the world, that was due to the stupidity of the other countries that always let themselves be bluffed.\\" Ribbentrop stated that the Anti-Comintern Pact was directed not against the Soviet Union, but against Western democracies, and \\"frightened principally the City of London [the British financiers] and the English shopkeepers\\".Brest to Soviet control in front of picture of Stalinleft243x243px He added that Berliners had joked that Stalin would yet join the Anti-Comintern Pact himself. Stalin proposed a toast to Hitler, and Stalin and Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov repeatedly toasted the German nation, the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, and Soviet- German relations. Ribbentrop countered with a toast to Stalin and a toast to the countries' relations. As Ribbentrop left, Stalin took him aside and stated that the Soviet Government took the new pact very seriously, and he would \\"guarantee his word of honor that the Soviet Union would not betray its partner.\\" Relations while dividing Poland One week after the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact's signing, the partition of Poland commenced with the German invasion of western Poland. The Soviet Comintern suspended all anti- Nazi and anti-fascist propaganda, explaining that the war in Europe was a matter of capitalist states attacking each other for imperialist purposes.Cohen, Yohanon, Small Nations in Times of Crisis and Confrontation, SUNY Press, 1989, , page 110 When anti-German demonstrations erupted in Prague, Czechoslovakia, the Comintern ordered the Czech Communist Party to employ all of its strength to paralyze \\"chauvinist elements.\\" Moscow soon forced the French Communist Party and the Communist Party of Great Britain to adopt an anti-war position. Two weeks after the German invasion, the Soviet Union invaded eastern Poland, coordinating with German forces. On September 21, the Soviets and Germans signed a formal agreement coordinating military movements in Poland, including the \\"purging\\" of saboteurs. A joint German- Soviet parade was held in L'vov and Brest. Stalin had decided in August that he was going to liquidate the Polish state, and a German-Soviet meeting in September addressed the future structure of the \\"Polish region.\\" The Soviet Union stated in September that it must enter Poland to \\"protect\\" their ethnic Ukrainian and Belarusian brethren therein from Germany, though Molotov later admitted to German officials that this excuse was necessary because the Soviets could find no other pretext for the Soviet invasion.Soviet and German generals during the official transfer of Brest to Soviet control, September 23, 1939 Three Baltic States described by the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, were given no choice but to sign a so-called 'Pact of defense and mutual assistance' which permitted the Soviet Union to station troops in them.Wettig, Gerhard, Stalin and the Cold War in Europe, Rowman & Littlefield, Landham, Md, 2008, , page 20-21 Expansion of raw materials and military trading Hitler's pressing for a German invasion of Poland in 1939 placed tremendous strain on the German war machine, which had been gradually gearing up for total war in 1942 or 1943. Germany's lack of raw materials meant that it had to seek increased supply from outside. However, a British blockade occurred, leaving it increasingly desperate for materials. The only remaining state capable of supplying Germany with the oil, rubber, manganese, grains, fats and platinum it needed was the Soviet Union. At the same time, the Soviets' demands for manufactured goods, such as German machines, were increasing while its ability to import those goods from outside decreased when many countries ceased trading relations after the Soviet entry into the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact. Accordingly, Germany and the Soviet Union entered an intricate trade pact on February 11, 1940 that was over four times larger than the one the two countries had signed in August 1939. The trade pact helped Germany to circumvent the British blockade. In the first year, Germany received hundreds of thousands of tons of cereals, oil, and other vital raw materials, transported through Soviet and occupied Polish territories. In addition, the Soviets provided Germany with access to the Northern Sea Route for both cargo ships and raiders (though only the raider Komet used the route before June 1941), which forced Britain to protect sea lanes in both the Atlantic and the Pacific. Deterioration of relations in mid-1940 Map depicting most of Central and Eastern Europe, showing 1938 borders, along with Axis (black) and Soviet (red) military and political advances until late 1940 Finland, the Baltics and Romania In November 1939, the Soviet Union invaded Finland,Kennedy-Pipe, Caroline, Stalin's Cold War, New York: Manchester University Press, 1995, resulting in stiff losses and the entry of an interim peace treaty in March 1940 granting the Soviet Union the eastern region of Karelia (10% of Finnish territory). In mid-June 1940, when international attention was focused on the German invasion of France, Soviet NKVD troops raided border posts in Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia,Senn, Alfred Erich, Lithuania 1940: Revolution from Above, Amsterdam, New York, Rodopi, 2007 replacing each government with pro-Soviet politicians who requested entry for their respective countries into the Soviet Union. In June, the Soviets issued an ultimatum demanding Bessarabia, Bukovina, and the Hertza region from Romania. After the Soviets agreed with Germany that they would limit their claims in Bukovina to northern Bukovina, Germany urged Romania to accept the ultimatum. Two days after the Soviet entry, the Romanians acceded to the Soviet demands and the Soviets occupied the territory. The Soviet invasion of Finland, which had been covertly ceded to it under the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop pact secret protocols, created domestic problems for Hitler. The German populace did not know about the secret protocols dividing up spheres of influence. Many Germans opposed the Soviet invasion of fellow Nordic peoples, and Finland possessed close ties with Germany. Hitler had to deflect opposition to Germany's pro-Soviet policies, including that by even Nazi party stalwarts. Supporting the Soviet invasion became one of the most ideologically and politically difficult aspects of the pact for the Nazi government to justify. The secret protocols caused Hitler to be in the humiliating position of having to hurriedly evacuate ethnic German families, the Volksdeutsche, who had lived in Finland and the Baltic countries for centuries, while officially condoning the invasions. While the three Baltic countries, not knowing about the secret protocols, sent letters protesting the Soviet invasions to Berlin, Ribbentrop returned them. In August, Molotov told the Germans that, with the government change, they could close down their Baltic consulates by September 1. The Soviet annexations in Romania caused further strain. While Germany had given the Soviets Bessarabia in the secret protocols, it had not given them Bukovina. Germany wanted the 100,000 tons of grain for which they had previously contracted with Bessarabia, guarantees of German property safety, guarantees for 125,000 Volksdeutsche in Bessarabia and Bukovina, and reassurance that the train tracks carrying Romanian oil would be left alone. Increasing German raw material dependence In the summer of 1940, Germany grew even more dependent on Soviet imports. German occupations of France, the Netherlands, and Belgium created additional demand while decreasing avenues for indirect supply. Compared to 1938 figures, the expanded Greater Germany and its sphere of influence lacked, among other items, 500,000 tons of manganese, 3.3 million tons of raw phosphate, 200,000 tons of rubber and 9.5 million tons of oil. Meanwhile, the Baltic invasions resulted in the Soviet occupation of states on which Germany had relied for 96.7 million Reichsmarks of imports in 1938 at blackmailed favorable economic terms, but from which they now had to pay Soviet prices. An eventual invasion of the Soviet Union increasingly looked like the only way in which Hitler believed that Germany could solve that resource crisis. While no concrete plans were yet made, Hitler told one of his generals in June that the victories in western Europe \\"finally freed his hands for his important real task: the showdown with Bolshevism\\", though German generals told Hitler that occupying Western Russia would create \\"more of a drain than a relief for Germany's economic situation.\\" Suspension of Soviet raw materials to Germany In August 1940, the Soviet Union briefly suspended its deliveries under their commercial agreement after their relations were strained following disagreement over policy in Romania, the Soviets' war with Finland, Germany falling behind in its deliveries of goods under the pact, and Stalin being worried that Hitler's war with the West might end quickly after France signed an armistice. The suspension created significant resource problems for Germany. By the end of August, relations improved again as the countries had redrawn the Hungarian and Romanian borders, settled some Bulgarian claims and Stalin was again convinced that Germany would face a long war in the west with Britain's improvement in its air battle with Germany and the execution of an agreement between the United States and Britain regarding destroyers and bases. However, in late August, Germany arranged its own annexation of part of Romania, targeting oil fields. The move raised tensions with the Soviets, who responded that Germany was supposed to have consulted with the Soviet Union under Article III of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact. Axis Pact Before entering a deal with Italy and Japan, German officials had discussed the feasibility of including the Soviet Union as a fourth member to direct Soviet focus southward, to the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf, both of which were then in the British sphere of influence. German officials indicated that they would be willing to give the Soviet Union freedom to operate east of the Dardanelles. Just before the signing of the agreement, Germany informed Molotov that it would enter the pact, and that while it was not explicitly stated, it was effectively directed against \\"American warmongers\\" by demonstrating to them the folly of war with three great powers aligned against them. Moscow had actually been aware of the proposed pact terms from Soviet intelligence sources in Japan. On September 27, 1940, Germany, Italy and Japan signed the Axis Pact, which divided the world into spheres of influence and was implicitly directed at the United States. The pact contained an explicit provision (Article 5) stating that it did not concern relations with the Soviet Union. Molotov, worried that the pact contained a secret codicil pertaining specifically to the Soviet Union, attempted to extract information from the Japanese ambassador in Moscow, Togo. On a home visit, German Moscow military attache Ernst K√∂string stated on October 31 that \\"the impression is steadily growing in me that the Russians want to avoid any conflict with us.\\" Meanwhile, from August to October, Germany conducted a massive air campaign against Britain to prepare for \\"Operation Sea Lion\\", the invasion of Britain. War or a higher level pact Ambassador Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg Throughout the summer, Hitler vacillated between plans to attack the Soviet Union, or to offer them part of a deal like the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, except looking south, where the Soviets would receive ports only on the west side of the Black Sea, or they might be given the Bosporus if Germany maintained a friendly third party state with access, such as Bulgaria. German ambassador to Moscow Friedrich von der Schulenburg had been contemplating a potential four power pact since the collapse of France in June. After he covertly learned about Hitler's potential Soviet invasion plans, which he opposed, von der Schulenburg and others began attempting to sway Hitler and his contingent to at least extend their agreement so long as Russia's claims remained in the areas of Turkey and Iran. He even concealed in his reports to Berlin the Soviets' doubts about Germany's good faith after the annexations in Romania. K√∂string, von der Schulenburg and others drafted a memorandum on the dangers of a German invasion of the Soviet Union, including why the Ukraine, Belarus and the Baltic States would end up only being a further economic burden for Germany. German Foreign Office State Secretary Ernst von Weizs√§cker argued that the Soviets in their current bureaucratic form were harmless, the occupation would not produce a gain for Germany and \\"why should it not stew next to us in its damp Bolshevism?\\" Stalin‚ÄìRibbentrop exchange in October In October 1940, Stalin requested that Molotov be permitted to discuss with Hitler the countries' future relations. Ribbentrop responded to Stalin in a letter that \\"in the opinion of the F√ºhrer... it appears to be the historical mission of the Four Powers ‚Äî the Soviet Union, Italy, Japan and Germany ‚Äî to adopt a long range-policy and to direct the future development of their peoples into the right channels by delimitation of their interests in a worldwide scale.\\" The delivery of Ribbentrop's letter was delayed to Stalin, resulting after earlier press stories in the ideas no longer seeming \\"fresh\\", causing Ribbentrop to lash out at the German Moscow embassy personnel. When delivering the letter, von Schulenburg stated that the Berlin conference would be a preliminary meeting preceding a convening of the four powers. Stalin was visibly pleased by the invitation for talks in Berlin. Stalin wrote a letter responding to Ribbentrop about entering an agreement regarding a \\"permanent basis\\" for their \\"mutual interests.\\" On November 6, K√∂string wrote that \\"since G√∂ring has now put our military deliveries in balance with the Russian deliveries, one may hope that the negotiations will end in peace and friendship.\\" During the first two weeks in November, German and Soviet economic negotiators in Moscow enjoyed moderate success. German military economic negotiators had hoped for success in the negotiations, in part, because they felt this would strengthen their arguments against Hitler's then increasingly anti-Soviet policy. On November 1, Army General Staff head Franz Halder met with Hitler and wrote, \\"The F√ºhrer hopes he can bring Russia into the anti-British front.\\" After Franklin D. Roosevelt won the presidential election four days later after promising there would be no foreign wars were he elected, Goebbels noted \\"after his statement, Roosevelt will hardly be able to enter the war in an active capacity.\\" Meeting with Benito Mussolini, Ribbentrop explained the German view of the meetings, that the acid test would be the Soviets' stand on the Balkans. With the Balkans and the Bosporus a potential \\"dangerous overlapping of interests\\", if the Soviets backed away from it, it would be a peaceful and even preferable alternative to an invasion. Hitler revealed to Mussolini that he did not expect to accommodate the Soviets beyond forcing Turkey to yield to some guarantees on the Bosporus. Nor did he want Stalin taking a Romanian entry point to the Bosporus, stating \\"one Romanian bird in the hand is worth more than two Russians in the bush.\\" But Hitler stated that he was skeptical because he believed that Stalin was obsessed with the Danube and Bulgaria. Germany was aware, however, that the Soviets had attempted to extend guarantees to Bulgaria to become its ally and that Bulgaria had turned them down. Molotov travels to Berlin 258x258px Front of Pravda, with photographs of Molotov in Berlin November 12 Stalin sent Molotov to Berlin to negotiate the terms for the Soviet Union to join the Axis and potentially enjoy the spoils of the pact. Molotov spent much of the trip to Berlin searching his rail car for listening devices. Molotov's train arrived at 11:05 a.m. on November 12. It was a bad omen for success that von Schulenburg, the architect of the meeting, was excluded. Molotov was greeted by Ribbentrop at the train station decorated with Soviet and Nazi flags above a large basket of flowers, with an orchestra playing The Internationale for the first time since 1933. After a brief breakfast, the talks started immediately that day at the Schloss Bellevue Hotel. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, a Moscow journal published certain selected correspondence revealing that Stalin was closely supervising Molotov's talks via telegram, but some of those telegrams remain unpublished. At the outset, Ribbentrop stated, \\"England is beaten and it is only a question of time when she will admit her defeat. ... The beginning of the end has now arrived for the British empire.\\" He further stated that \\"the entry of the United States into the war is of no consequence at all for Germany. Germany and Italy will never again allow an Anglo-Saxon to land on the European Continent. ... This is no military problem at all. ... The Axis Powers are, therefore, not considering how they can win the war, but rather how rapidly they can end the war which is already won.\\" He further stated that Germany and the Soviet Union had together \\"done some good business.\\" Accordingly, Ribbentrop concluded that the time had come for the four powers (Germany, the Soviet Union, Italy and Japan) to define their \\"spheres of interest.\\" He stated that Hitler had concluded that all four countries would naturally expand \\"in a southerly direction.\\" Ribbentrop said he wondered if the Soviets might turn southward toward the sea, and when Molotov inquired \\"which sea?\\", Ribbentrop stated that \\"in the long run the most advantageous access to the sea for Russia could be found in the direction of the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea.\\" Regarding the division of the world into four spheres of influence, Molotov stated the new idea was \\"very interesting\\" and worthy of a discussion in Moscow with Ribbentrop participating. Stalin became annoyed with a telegram to him from Molotov stating that the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop pact was \\"exhausted\\" with the exception of the Finnish issue, with Stalin stating that any future agreements would merely be added to it because it served as a fundamental basis for Soviet-German relations. In the afternoon, Molotov visited Hitler at the Reichskanzlei. Hitler also spoke of striking that \\"final blow against England.\\" Hitler stated that \\"it is time to think about division of the world after our victory.\\" Regarding the \\"problem of America,\\" according to Shirer, he stated that it could not \\"endanger the freedom of other nations before 1970 or 1980.\\" A different account gives Hitler's interpreter at the meeting, Paul Schmidt. Citing Hitler, Schmidt tells in his memoirs (1950): \\"Hitler went on to call for battle against the United States, who 'not in 1945 but at the earliest in 1970 or 1980 would seriously endanger the freedom of other nations'\\"Cited in Max Ostrovsky, The Hyperbola of the World Order, (Lanham: University Press of America, 2007, p 272). Hitler and Molotov agreed that the United States had no business in Europe, Africa or Asia. Hitler stated that there were no fundamental differences between the two countries in their pursuit of aspiring for \\"access to the ocean.\\" Molotov expressed his agreement with Hitler about the role of America and Britain and Soviet participation in the Axis Pact in principle but only if the Soviets could participate as an active partner. That same day, Germany also postponed until the following year its plans to invade Britain because of failures in the air campaign against Britain. Molotov agreed with Hitler that there were no unresolved problems between the countries, except about Finland. When Molotov returned to his hotel, he stated that he was \\"relieved at Hitler's amiability.\\" In a telegram to Molotov that night, Stalin insisted that the security of the USSR cannot be ensured \\"without securing tranquility in the area of the Straits\\", referring the Bosporus straits for entry into the Black Sea. That was linked directly with the Soviet-Bulgarian agreement for passage of Soviet troops for \\"the defense of entry into the Black Sea.\\" Stalin added that \\"this question still bears current importance and does not allow any procrastination.\\" November 13 The Bosporus intersects Istanbul in the southwest corner of the Black Sea. Bulgaria is to its north. Molotov and Hitler resumed their discussions the next morning. Molotov demanded to know why German troops were occupying Finland, while Hitler replied that they were traveling through Finland to Norway and wondered whether the Soviets intended to go to war over Finland. While Hitler agreed that Finland was within the Soviets' sphere of influence, he also stressed that Germany had a legitimate wartime interest in Finland's nickel and wood supply and that any new conflict in the Baltics would lead to a severe strain in relations. Molotov concluded that nothing good could come from further talks about Finland and stated that he saw no signs of any resumption of a Soviet-Finland conflict. According to Hitler, however, Molotov stated that \\"Russia felt herself again endangered by Finland, Russia should be able to liquidate Finland\\" which for him \\"was the first question which I found difficult to answer. But I could not do otherwise than refuse this\\".Adolf Hitler Explains His Reasons for Invading the Soviet Union Molotov conveyed Stalin's interest in reviewing the status of the Bosporus, and pressed for a guarantee for Bulgaria, at least in principle. Molotov later noted that Hitler became \\"markedly agitated\\" at the request to revoke guarantees to Romania. Molotov stated Stalin's wish to grant a guarantee to Bulgaria similar to the one that Germany and Italy had granted to Romania. Hitler pointed out that the Soviets had entered Bukovina in Romania, which went beyond the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact. Hitler stated the parties had made a prior oral agreement that the former Austrian territories, such as the Balkan states within the Austro-Hungarian empire, were to fall within the German sphere of influence. Hitler pointed out that a primary goal of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact was to restore the old empires of the countries. Stalin, still hopeful to get a draft agreement, was monitoring the conversations by telegram and sent a telegram to Molotov to remind Hitler of the importance of securing the Bosporus, explaining the events of the Crimean War. Hitler stated that he could not make decisions regarding Bulgaria without conversing first with Italian leader Benito Mussolini. Hitler changed the subject to the larger matter of the opportunities available after the conquest of England. Hitler told Molotov that: Molotov told Hitler that \\"the time has now come to discuss a broader agreement between the USSR and Germany\\", but first the Soviet government wanted to know the precise meaning of \\"the New Order in Europe\\" regarding participating countries and the ultimate aims of the pact. Molotov then was scheduled to meet with Ribbentrop that afternoon. A telegram Molotov sent to Stalin on the meeting with Hitler underscored \\"Hitler's great interest in reaching an agreement and strengthening friendly relations with the USSR with respect to spheres of influence.\\" Molotov stated that his talk with neither Hitler nor Ribbentrop produced the desired results, as the issues with Turkey and the Balkans had not been addressed. Because of British aerial bombardment, Ribbentrop and Molotov conducted talks that night in an air raid shelter. Ribbentrop reiterated that the chief goal was to define the four powers' interests and reach an agreement with Turkey on the Bosporus issue. Ribbentrop proposed several parallel steps the parties should then take including that Molotov should discuss the issues raised in Berlin with Stalin while Ribbentrop discussed them with Japan. Germany, Italy and the USSR would also pressure Turkey to acquiesce to Soviet demands on the Bosporus. Thereafter, the parties would negotiate and draft confidential documents bearing in mind that the final accord would be a Soviet entry into the Axis pact. What Molotov did not know is that, that night, Hitler issued secret \\"Instruction No. 18\\", directing his forces to continue to prepare for war in the east \\"irrespective of the results yielded by these discussions.\\"Weeks, Albert L., Stalin's Other War: Soviet Grand Strategy, 1939‚Äì1941, Rowman & Littlefield, 2003, , page 74‚Äì75 German proposed draft agreement In the air raid shelter, Ribbentrop gave Molotov a draft agreement with two parts. As had become the practice between the parties, one part was of the agreement that would eventually be made public, while the other contained the secret agreement. The public portion contained an agreement with a ten-year duration whereby the parties would respect each other's natural spheres of interests, while Germany, Italy and Japan would affirm their recognition of existing Soviet borders. The draft of the secret agreement included the obligation not to join any alliance directed at the four signatories and to assist each other in economic matters. The secret agreement contained a protocol defining the territorial objectives of the four signatories, with Germany laying claims to central Africa, Italy in northern and northeast Africa, Japan in southeast Asia and the Soviet zone to the ‚Äùcenter south of the national territory of the Soviet Union in the direction of the Indian Ocean.‚Äù A second secret protocol provided that Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union would \\"liberate\\" Turkey from its international obligations with Britain to guarantee its borders. Molotov stated that the Soviet Union was concerned with several European issues, such as Turkey and Bulgaria, but also the fates of Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia and Greece. In addition, the Soviets were also interested in the question of Swedish neutrality and passage out of the Baltic sea. Molotov also cuttingly remarked about why, if England's fate was sealed, they were talking in an air raid shelter. Reaction to Molotov trip The news that Molotov held talks in Berlin initially stunned world media, with the British press endeavoring to determine whether the Soviets were preparing to join the Axis pact. When Molotov returned, he noted that the meeting produced \\"nothing to boast about\\", that Ribbentrop's projected trip to Moscow was no longer mentioned but that the German draft proposal led to a complacent, rather than crisis, approach of continuing negotiations through \\"diplomatic channels.\\" The pro-\\"Continental Bloc\\" Germans in Ribbentrop's entourage expected that Stalin would eventually yield given the weakness of the Red Army. Weizs√§cker commented that \\"we can continue for a long time\\" and that \\"war with Russia is impossible as long as we are busy with England, and afterwards it will be unnecessary.\\" On November 14 K√∂string reiterated his conviction that the Soviet Union had no aggressive designs indeed, just the contrary: \\"Molotov's trip (to Berlin) is for me just further proof of an idea that I have long held namely, that the Soviet Union wants to have peace with us, since it cannot expect any advantage from a conflict with us. ... The decisive factor in [evoking] the Soviet desire for peace is and remains the demonstrated strength of our army.\\" Bulgarian pressure and a surprise Hitler had already issued a secret directive on the eventual attempts to invade the Soviet Union. However, he had not yet abandoned the possibility of other political outcomes, talking still of a \\"great worldwide coalition that stretched from Yokohama to Spain\\", but he had resolved to not give up the Balkans. In the meantime, the Soviets immediately summoned the Bulgarian ambassador to the Foreign Ministry, stating that the Soviets needed to do a deal with the Bulgarians before they joined the Axis and that Germany was attempting to make them a puppet state. The Bulgarians turned down the offer and leaked it to Germany. Hitler still hoped to dissuade Stalin from giving guarantees to Bulgaria if they could solve the Bosporus issue and pressed the Bulgarian ambassador that the Soviets could be persuaded against resistance if the Bulgarians joined the pact, while warning about the horrors of a Soviet occupation. The Soviets meanwhile produced the biggest surprise. In an unannounced November 25 visit in Sofia, the Soviets told the Bulgarian Prime Minister Bogdan Filov that, if Bulgaria permitted the Soviets troop transfer access, the Soviets were prepared to drop their objections to Bulgaria's entry into the Axis and, most surprisingly, stated that it likely would not be an issue as it would \\"very probably, almost certainly\\" lead to the Soviets' own entry into the Axis. The stunned Bulgarian Prime Minister stated that this required further contemplation. The Soviet negotiators had concluded that the Bulgarian government \\"is already committed to Germany to the hilt.\\" Soviet counterproposal agreement Stalin told the head of the Comintern, the Bulgarian Georgi Dimitrov, that, while Germany wanted Italy in the Balkans, in the final analysis, it had no choice but to recognize that the Soviets had interests in maintaining Black Sea access and to assure that the Bosporus would not be used against them. Stalin directed Molotov to draft a new pact with a much greater scope, including the division of Europe, Asia and Africa among the four powers. On November 25, the same day as the surprise statement of Soviet non-resistance to Bulgaria's joining the Axis and a potential Soviet joining of the Pact, the Soviets offered a counterproposal to Ribbentrop's draft agreement. It began with \\"The Soviet government is prepared to accept the draft of the Pact of Four Powers on political cooperation and economic mutual assistance.\\" Instead of two secret protocols, Stalin proposed five: # that German troops depart Finland in exchange for a Soviet guarantee of continued nickel and wood shipments and peace with Finland; # a mutual assistance pact be signed with Bulgaria in the next few months permitting Soviet bases # The center of Soviet territorial domination would be south of Baku and Batumi (ports in modern Azerbaijan and Georgia, south of which are Iraq and Iran) # Japanese renunciation of rights to northern Sakhalin oil and coal concessions in exchange for appropriate compensation # Affirms that the Soviet-Bulgaria mutual assistance treaty was a political necessity. The proposals came concurrently with massively increased economic offers. The Soviets promised, by May 11, 1941 the delivery of 2.5 million tons of grain‚Äî1 million tons above its current obligations. They also promised full compensation for the Volksdeutsche property claims. German reaction Schnurre, who could not conceal his delight over the offer, immediately telegrammed Berlin that \\"in view of the present status of the negotiations here, Molotov's statements today must be viewed as a surprising indication of good will on the part of the Soviet Government. Molotov's proposal regarding compensation for property claims in the Baltic states considerably exceeds our expectations.\\" Hitler, however, saw the Soviet territorial ambitions in the Balkans as a challenge to German interests and saw its plan as effectively making Bulgaria into an adjunct of the Axis pact. On several occasions, Molotov asked German officials for their response to Moscow's counterproposals, but Germany never answered them.Donaldson, Robert H. and Joseph L. Nogee, The Foreign Policy of Russia: Changing Systems, Enduring Interests, M.E. Sharpe, 2005, , pages 65‚Äì66Churchill, Winston, The Second World War, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 1953, , pages 520‚Äì21 Germany's refusal to respond to the counterproposal worsened relations between the countries. Regarding the counterproposal, Hitler remarked to his top military chiefs that Stalin \\"demands more and more\\", \\"he's a cold-blooded blackmailer\\" and that \\"a German victory has become unbearable for Russia\\" so that \\"she must be brought to her knees as soon as possible.\\" Weisung Nr. 21: Fall Barbarossa On December 5, Hitler received military plans for the possible invasion, and approved them all, with a schedule to begin in May 1941. On December 18, 1940, Hitler signed F√ºhrer Directive No. 21 to the German high command for an operation now codenamed Operation Barbarossa stating: \\"The German Wehrmacht must be prepared to crush Soviet Russia in a quick campaign.\\" The date for the invasion was set for May 15, 1941. On the other side of the border, Stalin had anticipated an eventual war with Germany. Speaking to his generals in December, Stalin referenced Hitler's references to a Soviet attack in Mein Kampf, stated that they must always be ready to repulse a German attack, stated that Hitler thought that the Red Army would require four years to ready itself such that \\"we must be ready much earlier\\" and \\"we will try to delay the war for another two years.\\" On January 17, 1941, seven days after the German‚ÄìSoviet Border and Commercial Agreement, Molotov asked German officials whether the parties could then work out an agreement for entry into the Axis pact. Molotov expressed astonishment at the absence of any answer to the Soviets' November 25 offer to join the Pact. They never received an answer. On March 1, 1941, Bulgaria joined the Axis, which further unsettled Stalin when combined with Germany's continued ignoring of Stalin's November 25, 1940 Axis entry proposal. After six months of preparations, Germany invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, ending any hope for the proposed alliance. Three years later, Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg was executed as one of the conspirators in the July 20, 1944 Plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler. Postwar Soviet reactions: \\"Falsifiers of History\\" In 1948, one month after Nazi government foreign ministry documents describing the negotiations were publicly released by the United States, the Soviet Foreign Information Bureau wrote a response in a book titled Falsifiers of History. After receiving translations of the newly released documents, Stalin personally edited, struck and re-wrote entire sections by hand drafts he had been given of Falsifiers before its release in February 1948. In Falsifiers, Stalin claimed that he was merely \\"probing out\\" Germany in Axis negotiations and to have outright rejected Hitler's proposal to share a division of the world. That version persisted, without exception, in all historical studies, official accounts, memoirs and textbooks published in the USSR until 1990.

It is Louisville's best known brick street or alley. Description The brick portion of the street covers a steep hill with a mean slope of approximately 15 degrees. The brick portion originally extended for approximately 740 feet but asphalt paving has already been applied to about 137 feet at the top of the hill, leaving an area, of brick paving 603 feet by 30 feet wide. The hill is paved with vitrified bricks which are laid at angles in a sand base. The angling is not found in any other remaining brick alley street in the city. This method helps to create traction on the surface in wet weather. The hill is edged by a stone curb. sides. History Peterson Avenue was created when the Peterson-Dumesnil House's estate was carved up in the late 19th century and Crescent Hill became a subdivided residential neighborhood. The Peterson-Dumesnil estate was carved into property for Barrett Middle School and four residences, all on the east side of the hill. In 1902, Louisville passed an ordinance calling for the avenue to be paved. The street takes its name from Joseph Peterson, a wealthy tobacco merchant who built the Peterson-Dumesnil house in 1869 or 1870. Bricks were a popular choice at the time, as Louisville had several brickyards and bricks were cheap and an improvement over previous paving surfaces such as clay, clay-sand, and gravel or macadam. There is an oral tradition associating the hill with the early history of the automobile in Louisville. Car dealers would boast that their cars could pull Peterson Hill in high gear, and many cars were put to just such a test. The fire department also used Peterson Hill to test its new fire engines. In June 1979, Peterson Avenue Hill was designated a local landmark.

In 1948, Indian Army established a ski school in Gulmarg which later became the High Altitude Warfare School of the Indian army specialising in snow‚Äìcraft and winter warfare. It is located in an area which is prone to avalanches. It is one of the most famous warfare academies of the world. Selected soldiers from the US, UK, Germany and other countries visit regularly for specialist training. History The birth of High Altitude Warfare School(HAWS) of Indian Army in 1948 can be directly attributed to the loss of Gilgit-Baltistan in the Siege of Skardu to Pakistan in 1947-1948 Indo-Pak war. The school was established in December 1948 by General K S Thimayya, then holding the rank of Brigadier. It was initially known as the 19 Infantry Division Ski School. During the winter of 1949‚Äì50, the school was redesignated as a Command Establishment and renamed as the Winter Warfare School. On 8 April 1962, it was upgraded to a Category A Training Establishment and adopted its current name. Training HAWS offers two training programmes, the Mountain Warfare course and the Winter Warfare course. The Mountain Warfare course is conducted in Sonamarg between May and October each year. The Winter Warfare course is conducted in Gulmarg between January and April. The two courses train personnel in High Altitude warfare, counter intelligence and survival skills. Ice-craft is taught at Machoi across Zojila. Army personnel deployed to the Siachen Glacier and to other high altitude forward posts on the Himalayan borders go through the courses. HAWS is the nodal instructional facility for specialized training and dissemination of approved doctrines in mountain, high altitude and snow warfare. The training programs at HAWS are open to personnel of the armed forces of friendly countries. U.S. Army Capt.

Early life and marriage Hinkle was born in San Francisco, California, to physician B. Frederick Moses and Elizabeth Benchley Van Geisen. In 1892 she married Walter Scott Hinkle, an assistant district attorney. Hinkle had considered studying law, but after being discouraged by her husband \\"with a good hardy laugh\\", she entered Cooper Medical College (now part of Stanford University) in 1895. Writing In 1905 Hinkle became the first woman physician in the country to hold a public health position (McHenry, 1980). She was appointed as San Francisco's city physician. This particular fact was very important in her career because this was the very first time a female doctor was given such a responsibility. In 1908 she moved East to New York City and (along with Dr. Charles R. Dana) founded the country's first therapeutic clinic in the United States in 1908 at Cornell Medical School (McHenry 1980). In 1909 she decided to study with Freud and left for Vienna. While she admired Freud's contributions to psychoanalysis, she later broke with his teachings finding herself at odds with the rigid sexual hypotheses of the strictly Freudian analysts (Karier, 1986). Freud's lack of recognition to women's psychological autonomy led her to change her mind about Freud's understanding of the human psyche. Thus Freud's thinking pushed her to align herself with the psychoanalytic group that supported Carl Jung's theories. Tired of hearing Freud's assertion that female psyche was a derivation of the male's, Dr. Hinkle returned to New York in 1915 determined to spread Jung's words in America. One of Dr. Beatrice Moses Hinkle's major distinction is that she was the first to present Carl Jung's writing to the English-speaking world. Jung's consideration of the female psyche as independent from males, attracted the admiration of Dr. Hinkle in such degree that she became the official translator of his work in America. In 1916 she translated Psychology of the Unconscious: A Study of the Transformations and Symbolisms of the Libido. She was a fundamental part of the book since her own ideas were included in this work. She renewed these theories and remained a constant contributor. Dr. Hinkle added several theories of her own that were constructed through her personal experience with both Freud and Jung. She broadened the context of terms such as \\"complex\\" and \\"repression.\\" She explained that \\" This important group of ideas or impressions, those that come out from the patient's mind while being psychoanalyzed, with the feelings and emotions clustered around them which are betrayed through this painful process, was called by Jung a complex\\" (Hinkle, 1916, p. 14). Dr. Hinkle thought that one of the most attractive parts of Jung's theories was referred to the relief for those in revolt against the repressive character of the patriarchal society that under girded Freud's worldview (Karier, 1986). In this aspect, Jung proposed that the mother is the real dominant figure in the child's life and not the father as proposed by Freud. This also allowed for a break with the masculine dominance of Freudian psychology without blurring the traditional distinctions between masculine and feminine psychosexual roles. About this particular Jung's assertion, Dr. Hinkle expressed: \\"Jung's development of this point of view shows very clearly that, just as the problem of the father is the great fact of Freud's psychology, the problem of the mother is the essence of Jung's, with the struggle carried on between the two great forces of love and power\\" (Karier, 1986, p. 291). Thus Jung's consideration of the female psyche as independent from males, attracted the admiration of Dr. Hinkle in such degree that she became the official translator of his work in America. Hinkle was a member of the Greenwich Village based feminist network, the Heterodoxy Club, lending credence to the group by being the only professionally trained and practicing psychoanalyst. It was as a member of this group that she began writing, including occasional contributions to Progressive Education Survey and Harper's Magazine. Her themes included women's rights, women's suffrage, and issues of divorce, individualism, and legal status. She wrote often of the need for women to liberate themselves from what she called the \\"psychic bondage\\" of women to men. Her book, The Re-Creating of the Individual: A Study of Psychological Types and Their Relation to Psychoanalysis, was favorably reviewed in The New York Times in 1923. In addition to her own writing and Jung translations, she also contributed to the books The Book of Marriage by Hermann von Keyserling, and Our Changing Morality by Freda Kirchwey. Her autobiographical essay was published in 2003 in These Modern Women: Autobiographical Essays from the Twenties, edited by Elaine Showalter.

They are a semi-parodic act that plays cover versions of punk rock and hardcore punk \\"standards\\" by slightly renaming songs and adjusting lyrics to address Chicano culture. The band's members are all Mexican or part Mexican and use stage names further marking the Mexican/Chicano image of the band. Manic Hispanic is a punk supergroup made up of former and/or current members of The Adolescents, The Grabbers, Punk Rock Karaoke, The X-Members, 22 Jacks, Final Conflict, Agent Orange, Death by Stereo and The Cadillac Tramps.  Band formation  Manic Hispanic was originally started in 1992 by Mike \\"Gabby\\" Gaborno (a.k.a. Jefe) from The Cadillac Tramps and Steve Soto (a.k.a. El Hoakie Loco) from The Adolescents/22 Jacks, originally with the intent to perform doo-wop versions of punk songs. Members later recruited are: Chino and Mo Grease (members of The Grabbers), Oso (from The Cadillac Tramps), Mad Ralphie (a.k.a. Steve\\"Ace\\" Acevedo a Sound Engineer and tour manager), and Sonny (a.k.a. Tio). According to their Myspace page, the band members have changed since their first album. The name of the band keeps with their habit of mashing up Latin/Cholo culture with punk culture, the name being a play on Manic Panic a brand of hair dye popular in the punk scene.  Recorded material  Their first album was released in 1992 on Doctor Dream records. Entitled The Menudo Incident, a reference to Guns N' Roses' The Spaghetti Incident, it featured cover versions of songs by The Buzzcocks, The Damned, X, Black Flag, Wire, The Clash, and others. These cover versions featured rewritten lyrics humorously reflecting the Chicano identity of the band and Chicano/Mexican culture as a whole. Tracks commonly include lyrics sung in Spanish, English, and Chicano \\"slang\\" a.k.a. Cal√≥. Examples include songs such as The Damned's \\"New Rose\\" retitled \\"New Rosa\\", and Eddie and the Subtitles' \\"American Society\\" retitled \\"Mexican Society.\\" The Menudo Incident also contains a version of Tejano/country musician Freddy Fender's \\"Before the Next Teardrop Falls\\", a bilingual hit when released by Fender in the 1970s. The cover art mimicked the Guns N' Roses release, showing a bowl of menudo, the traditional Mexican tripe specialty. The band returned with a second album in 2001, The Recline of Mexican Civilization (spoofing the punk film The Decline of Western Civilization) for BYO Records. BYO also released Mijo Goes to Jr. College (aping The Descendents' Milo Goes To College) in 2003, and Grupo Sexo (spoofing the Circle Jerks' Group Sex) in 2005. These albums modify the original cover art of the albums they are playing off of. The band's out-of-print debut album, The Menudo Incident, was reissued by BYO in 2003. The band has also released T-shirts based on the Ramones logo, Dead Kennedys' graphics, and the Social Distortion logo.  Chicano identity  The band's biography information from BYO Records is written in a humorous style, alleging in jest that forming the band was suggestion by one of their parole officers. Although this may be interpreted as tongue-in-cheek, the band has declared in an interview for InMusicWeTrust.com that, \\"we're not cholos or gangsters, but we come from that heritage and we're proud of it.\\" While most of the band's material is delivered with a sense of humor, political undertones do occasionally appear in their music, such as \\"Poem\\" from The Menudo Incident, tells a first-hand account of fearing a potential drive-by shooting, told over a doo-wop backing. In addition, their cover of Iggy & The Stooges' \\"I Got A Right\\" includes the lyric, \\"I got a right, got a right to speak/any language I want, yeah.\\" The band also traditionally plays live in California on Cinco de Mayo.

A Royal Australian Navy officer who transferred permanently to the Air Force in 1928, he commanded No. 101 (Fleet Cooperation) Flight in the early 1930s, and No. 104 (Bomber) Squadron RAF on exchange in Britain shortly before World War II. Hewitt was appointed the RAAF's Assistant Chief of the Air Staff in 1941. The following year he was posted to Allied Air Forces Headquarters, South West Pacific Area, as Director of Intelligence. In 1943, he took command of No. 9 Operational Group, the RAAF's main mobile strike force, but was controversially sacked by the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal George Jones, less than a year later over alleged morale and disciplinary issues. Described as a \\"small, dapper man\\",Stephens & Isaacs, High Fliers, pp. 97‚Äì99 who was \\"outspoken, even 'cocky'\\",Dennis et al., Oxford Military History of Australia, p. 259 Hewitt overcame the setback to his career during the war and made his most significant contributions afterwards, as Air Member for Personnel from 1945 to 1948. Directly responsible for the demobilisation of thousands of wartime staff and the consolidation of what was then the world's fourth largest air force into a much smaller peacetime service, he also helped modernise education and training within the RAAF. Hewitt was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1951, the same year he became Air Member for Supply and Equipment. Retiring from the military in 1956, he went into business and later managed his own publishing house. He wrote two books including Adversity in Success, a first-hand account of the South West Pacific air war, before his death in 1985 aged 84. Early career Born on 13 April 1901 in Tylden, Victoria, Joseph Eric Hewitt was the son of Joseph Henry Hewitt and his wife Rose Alice, n√©e Harkness.Draper, Who's Who in Australia 1985, p. 409 He attended Scotch College, Melbourne, before entering the Royal Australian Naval College at Jervis Bay in 1915, aged 13. After graduating in 1918, Hewitt was posted to Britain as a midshipmen to serve with the Royal Navy. He rose to lieutenant in the RAN before volunteering for secondment to the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) as a flight lieutenant in January 1923.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 23‚Äì24 Hewitt undertook the pilots' course at No. 1 Flying Training School, Point Cook, and graduated at the end of the year.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, p. 34 He was further seconded to the Royal Air Force in May 1925, holding a temporary commission as a flying officer until September. He married Lorna Bishop in Sydney on 10 November; they had three daughters. Seagull III of No. 101 Flight being hoisted aboard the seaplane carrier HMAS Albatross In August 1926, Hewitt joined the newly formed No. 101 (Fleet Cooperation) Flight, operating Seagull III amphibians. Prior to the unit deploying to Queensland to survey the Great Barrier Reef with HMAS Moresby, he practiced manoeuvres around the centre of Melbourne, landing in the Yarra River near Flinders Street station. Media criticism of the escapade led to him being brought before the Chief of the Air Staff, Group Captain Richard Williams, who rather than upbraiding Hewitt expressed himself \\"reservedly pleased about the publicity\\". After completing its survey work in November 1928, the unit served aboard the seaplane carrier HMAS Albatross.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 408‚Äì411 Hewitt's transfer to the Air Force was made permanent in April 1928. Promoted to squadron leader, he became commanding officer of No. 101 Flight in February 1931,Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 218 and supervised embarkation of the Seagull aboard the cruiser HMAS Australia in September‚ÄìOctober 1932. Wilson, The Eagle and the Albatross, p. 27 Hewitt finished his tour with No. 101 Flight the following year, and was posted to Britain in 1934. He attended RAF Staff College, Andover, in his first year abroad, and served as Assistant Liaison Officer at Australia House, London, in 1935. Although a specialist seaplane pilot, he converted to bombers in England, flying Hawker Hinds and Bristol Blenheims as commanding officer of No. 104 Squadron RAF from 1936. Wilson, The Eagle and the Albatross, p. 51 Hewitt was promoted wing commander in January 1938. Returning to Australia, he was appointed senior air staff officer (SASO) at RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, in June. In May 1939, Hewitt was chosen to lead No. 10 Squadron, due to be formed on 1 July at the recently established RAAF Station Rathmines, near Lake Macquarie. He was preparing to depart for England to take delivery of the unit's planned complement of Short Sunderland flying boats when he broke his neck riding his motor cycle near Richmond, and had to forgo the assignment while he recovered. Fit for duty by August, he was given command of the Rathmines base to manage the deployment of No. 10 Squadron and its aircraft, but this was suspended due to the outbreak of World War II in September, and the Sunderlands and their RAAF crews remained in Britain for service alongside the RAF.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 150 World War II Director of Personal Services to AOC No. 9 Operational Group Hewitt (second right) and Group Captains alt=Five men in dark military uniforms behind a desk, four of whom are standing and one sitting On 20 November 1939, the RAAF formed No. 1 Group in Melbourne,Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, p. 67 which evolved into Southern Area Command early in 1940 with Hewitt as senior administration staff officer.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, p. 92 Having been promoted group captain in December 1939, Hewitt was made Director of Personal Services (DPS) at RAAF Headquarters in July 1940. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire on 11 July for his performance as SASO at Richmond. Described by author Joyce Thompson as having \\"a Calvinist background and rigid ideas on women's place in society\\", as DPS Hewitt opposed the creation of the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force (WAAAF) and later advocated that its members be enrolled on a contractual basis rather than enlisted or commissioned as Permanent Air Force staff.Thomson, The WAAAF in Wartime Australia, pp. 58‚Äì59 Promoted acting air commodore, he became Acting Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in October 1941.Ashworth, How Not to Run an Air Force!, p. 295 In January 1942, he was posted to the staff of American-British-Dutch-Australian Command in the Dutch East Indies. Hewitt served as Assistant Chief of the Air Staff in March and April before being assigned to the newly formed Allied Air Forces Headquarters (AAF HQ), South West Pacific Area (SWPA), as Director of Intelligence.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, p. 473 He established cordial working relations with his American peers at AAF HQ, becoming a confidant of its commander, Major General George Kenney. In February 1943, Hewitt was appointed Air Officer Commanding (AOC) No. 9 Operational Group (No. 9 OG).Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 122‚Äì123 The RAAF's main mobile strike force, No. 9 OG initially comprised seven Australian combat squadrons and came under the control of the US Fifth Air Force.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, p. 6 The month he took over, Hewitt's squadrons were reorganised into two wings based in New Guinea: No. 71 Wing, comprising units at Milne Bay, New Guinea, and No. 73 Wing, comprising those at Port Moresby.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 23‚Äì24 In March, No. 9 OG led the RAAF's contribution to the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, \\"the decisive aerial engagement\\" in the SWPA according to General Douglas MacArthur, resulting in 12 Japanese ships being sunk.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 160‚Äì165 Hewitt occasionally flew with his crews on operations, contrary to General Kenney's policy against commanders taking such risks.Ashworth, How Not to Run an Air Force!, p. 211 Hewitt (right) with the USAAF's Major General alt=Full-length, three-quarter-angle, outdoor portrait of half a dozen or so men in light tropical military uniforms with headgear, standing to attention. Two of the men are in the foreground and the rest in a row behind them. By April 1943, Hewitt had been dragged into the divisive personal conflict between the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal George Jones, and the AOC of RAAF Command, Air Vice Marshal Bill Bostock. RAAF Command was the Air Force's main operational formation in the Pacific, controlling 24 Australian squadrons. Jones, administrative and de jure head of the RAAF, sought to extend his authority into the sphere of operations by posting a \\"more accountable\\" officer into Bostock's position, namely Hewitt.Helson, Ten Years at the Top, pp. 122‚Äì126 The Minister for Air, Arthur Drakeford, backed Jones' manoeuvre but was informed by Prime Minister John Curtin that MacArthur, as Supreme Commander SWPA, \\"would insist on the replacement of AVM Bostock by an equally able officer\\", and that \\"Air Commodore Hewitt ... was not considered an adequate replacement.\\"Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 16‚Äì18 Hewitt recognised qualities in both Jones and Bostock, and tried not to take sides in their feud.Ashworth, How Not to Run an Air Force!, pp. 210‚Äì211 No changes were made to command arrangements in the South West Pacific following this episode, and Hewitt continued to lead No. 9 OG in its bombing and strafing campaign against Japanese airfields and lines of communication in New Britain, north- east of New Guinea. By mid-June 1943, he had set up Group Headquarters at Milne Bay, and No. 73 Wing HQ at Goodenough Island. On 22 July, he mounted an operation against Gasmata airfield using 62 aircraft from five of his squadrons, the largest strike undertaken by the Australians to that date.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 33‚Äì35 No. 9 OG would take most of the credit for the RAAF reaching a peak of 254 tons of bombs dropped in October, as against 137 tons delivered the previous month.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 93‚Äì95 On 8 November, Hewitt sent out a formation of three Bristol Beauforts in a severe electrical storm to attack the heavily defended harbour at Rabaul. This was conceived as a \\"make or break\\" effort to prove the worth or otherwise of the Beaufort as a torpedo bomber, in which role it had so far been a disappointment; in what the official history of the RAAF in World War II described as \\"an heroic attack\\", at least one enemy tanker was struck, for the loss of one Beaufort.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 100‚Äì102 The planning and execution of the raid led to conflict between Hewitt and the commanding officer of the Beaufort squadron, Wing Commander G. D. Nicoll, and Hewitt dismissed Nicoll shortly afterwards; the decision was swiftly reversed by Air Vice Marshal Jones. AOC No. 9 Operational Group to Air Member for Personnel 1943 Federal electionalt=Three-quarter-length outdoor portrait of moustacioed man in light tropical military uniform with pith helmet and pilot's wings on left breast pocket, placing folded paper into a box marked \\"RAAF BALLOT BOX\\" Although Hewitt was performing an \\"excellent job\\" according to Fifth Air Force commander Major General Ennis Whitehead, he was controversially removed from his post in mid-November 1943 by Jones, over accusations of poor discipline and morale within No. 9 OG.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 102‚Äì103 RAAF historian Alan Stephens later described the circumstances of Hewitt's dismissal as \\"murky\\", and the allegations leading to it as unofficial. Drakeford defended Hewitt's service record, informing the Prime Minister that \\"the present position may be largely, if not entirely, due to some temporary physical stress brought about by the strain of his important duties as A.O.C. of No. 9 Group.\\" Hewitt himself believed that he had been smeared by a disgruntled former staff officer; historian Kristen Alexander identified Wing Commander Kenneth Ranger, who would play a leading part in the \\"Morotai Mutiny\\" of 1945, as having made allegations regarding Hewitt's supposed \\"lack of balance, vanity and lack of purpose in the prosecution of the war\\".Alexander, \\"Cleaning the Augean stables\\" Hewitt returned to his previous position as Director of Intelligence at Allied Air Headquarters, and the Air Member of Personnel, Air Commodore Frank Lukis, took over as AOC No. 9 OG in December. General Kenney considered Hewitt's removal \\"bad news\\". After completing his tour as Director of Intelligence at AAF HQ at the end of 1944, Hewitt became acting Air Member for Personnel (AMP) in 1945.Helson, Ten Years at the Top, p. 224 As AMP, Hewitt sat on the Air Board, the RAAF's controlling body that consisted of its most senior officers and was chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, p. 112 Along with the other members of the board, he reviewed the findings of the inquiry by Justice John Vincent Barry into the \\"Morotai Mutiny\\", which had involved senior pilots of the Australian First Tactical Air Force (No. 1 TAF) attempting to resign their commissions to protest the relegation of RAAF fighter squadrons to strategically unimportant ground attack missions. Hewitt recommended that the AOC No. 1 TAF, Air Commodore Harry Cobby, be removed from command, along with his two senior staff officers. The majority of the Air Board saw no reason to take such action, leaving Hewitt to append a dissenting note to its decision. Drakeford supported Hewitt's position, and the three senior No. 1 TAF officers were later dismissed from their posts by Air Vice Marshal Jones. Post-war career Demobilisation and rationalisation Hewitt's appointment as Air Member for Personnel was made permanent following the end of World War II in August 1945. In this role he was directly responsible for the demobilisation of what had become the world's fourth largest air force, and its transition to a much smaller peacetime service.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 170‚Äì171 Hewitt considered that the RAAF was in danger of losing some of its best staff through rapid, unplanned demobilisation, and recommended that its workforce be stabilised for two years at a strength of 20,000 while it reviewed its post- war requirements. Although the Air Board supported Hewitt's proposal, government cost-cutting resulted in the strength of the so-called Interim Air Force remaining lower than planned, being reduced to some 13,000 by October 1946 and under 8,000 by the end of 1948.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 176‚Äì179 Despite claiming that employing women in the Air Force was an important factor in reducing \\"antagonism and prejudice\\" against them in the work force in general, Hewitt also recommended that the WAAAF be disbanded after the war.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 335 As AMP, Hewitt was responsible for reviewing the potential employment of senior officers in the post-war Air Force. This review led to the early retirement of such figures as Air Marshal Richard Williams and Air Vice Marshals Stanley Goble, Bill Bostock, Frank McNamara, Bill Anderson, Henry Wrigley and Adrian Cole, ostensibly to make way for the advancement of younger and equally capable officers.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 22‚Äì24Helson, Ten Years at the Top, pp. 234‚Äì239 Hewitt helped draft the letters to each of the retirees, explaining the reasons for the decision and redundancy payments involved. He was also responsible for rationalising the Air Force List of officers and their seniority that had become a source of numerous irregularities due to the temporary and acting promotions granted during wartime. This resulted in many officers of senior rank being demoted as many as three levels, such as group captain to flight lieutenant, in the first post-war List released in June 1947.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 24‚Äì25 RAAF education and other work Hewitt (centre) inspecting a USAF alt=Three men in military uniforms with peaked caps crowding around the open cockpit of a military aircraft, two facing the camera and one with his back turned. The central figure in the portrait, facing the camera, has two rows of braid on the visor of his cap, and pilot's wings on the left breast pocket. Hewitt was responsible for initiating major improvements in Air Force education that took place between 1945 and 1953, playing a key role in the establishment of RAAF College and the introduction of an apprenticeship training programme. The purpose of the College was, in Hewitt's words, to \\"sow the seeds of service\\" for future leaders, helping create a special RAAF esprit de corps. He added that it was \\"almost a truism that the future RAAF can be no better than the Air Force College\\".Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, p. 186 Founded at Point Cook in January 1948, RAAF College's inaugural commandant was Air Commodore Val Hancock, who also drafted its first charter.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 120‚Äì123 With the support of the Air Member for Engineering and Maintenance, Air Vice Marshal Ellis Wackett, Hewitt developed the Apprenticeship Training Scheme to raise the standard of technical roles in the Air Force, introducing it with a nationwide publicity campaign to attract recruits. Its base was the Ground Training School, which opened at Wagga, New South Wales, in early 1948 to provide education and technical training for youths aged 15 to 17\\\\. It was renamed RAAF Technical College in 1950 and the RAAF School of Technical Training in 1952.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 129‚Äì131 Parallel to his initiatives in Air Force education and training, Hewitt introduced a revised aircrew ranking scheme that consisted of skill categories with various levels, such as navigator level 4 or pilot level 1, rather than the regular military ranks such as sergeant or flight lieutenant. This was abandoned in 1950 due to dissatisfaction caused by the lack of obvious equivalence between these specialist \\"ranks\\" and the traditional ranking system common to the rest of the RAAF and other defence forces.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 92‚Äì95 After completing his term as Air Member for Personnel in 1948, he was posted to London as the Australian Defence Representative. By now promoted air vice marshal, Hewitt was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1951 New Year Honours, in part for his leadership of No. 9 OG during the war. Returning from Britain the same year, he took over as Air Member for Supply and Equipment (AMSE) from Air Vice Marshal George Mackinolty, who had died suddenly of cancer.Stephens & Isaacs, High Fliers, pp. 104‚Äì107Stephens, Going Solo, p. 500 Hewitt served as AMSE until his retirement from the RAAF in April 1956. In this role, he again cooperated with Air Vice Marshal Wackett‚Äînow the Air Member for Technical Services‚Äîto introduce the concept of acquiring spare parts based on \\"life-of-type\\", whereby the forecast number and type of spares necessary for an aircraft's projected service life would be ordered when it was first deployed operationally, to reduce support costs and delivery times.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 182 Later life and legacy Following his retirement from the Air Force in 1956, Hewitt joined International Harvester Co. Australia as Manager of Education and Training. He became a trustee of the Services Canteen Trust the same year, serving in this position until 1977. Having retired from International Harvester in 1966, Hewitt became an author in later life and wrote two books on his experiences in the military. The first, Adversity in Success, was published in 1980 and gave his account of the air war in the South West Pacific. He followed it in 1984 with The Black One. Hewitt also acted as chairman and managing director of his own publishing house, Langate Publishing. Predeceased by his wife Lorna, he died in Melbourne on 1 November 1985, and was survived by his daughters. Historian Alan Stephens credits Hewitt with being primarily responsible for the \\"education revolution\\" that took place in the RAAF between 1945 and 1953, noting that Hewitt's initiatives while Air Member for Personnel were carried on by his successor in the position, Air Vice Marshal Frank Bladin.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 118 According to Stephens and Jeff Isaacs, the importance of RAAF College and the Apprenticeship Training Scheme in contributing to the professionalism of the post-war service \\"cannot be over-stated\\". Air Vice Marshal Ernie Hey, the Air Member for Technical Services from 1960 through 1972, declared that the apprenticeship programme was \\"one of the best things\\" the RAAF ever established and that its graduates‚Äînumbering some 5,500 from 1952 to 1993‚Äîwere \\"absolutely outstanding\\".Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 191‚Äì192 Joe Hewitt is commemorated by Hewitt Reef in Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, named in his honour by the survey team on HMAS Moresby, with whom he worked as a member of No. 101 Flight in 1926‚Äì1928. Hewitt also founded an eponymous trophy for small arms proficiency in the Air Force.

It involves a British adventurer, the eponymous Henry Hatsworth, who is on a mission to find the \\"Golden Suit\\", a garb that allows the wearer to control the \\"Puzzle Realm\\". The player must solve puzzles on the touch screen to destroy fallen enemies from the top screen. Gameplay As the player defeats enemies on the top screen, they are sent to the bottom screen in the form of blocks. While the game is an action- platformer on the top screen, once enemies are defeated by Hatsworth, they are sent to the bottom screen as puzzle blocks. The puzzle game on the bottom screen plays much like Nintendo's Puzzle League, as blocks need to be linked in a chain of three or more of the same color to be cleared, and any blocks resting on top of the cleared ones will fall into their place, potentially leading to a chain reaction of blocks being cleared if they fall into place and end up touching more of the same colors. As the blocks on the puzzle screen rise, the enemy blocks that touch the upper edge of the screen are revived and can attack Hatsworth again on the top screen. The player can prevent this by swapping blocks to form groups of three or more, causing them to be destroyed, and their energy to add to the \\"Super Meter\\". Certain blocks may also power up Hatsworth's attacks, or restore his health, while others may hinder the player. If the Super Meter is filled, Hatsworth becomes younger, and his health increases. If it is then filled to double its capacity, the player can activate a mode called \\"Tea Time\\", causing Hatsworth to pilot a mecha (called his Robot Suit) and become invincible until the Super Meter depletes. Using the money earned by defeating enemies or collecting treasure, the player can return to Hatsworth's assistant's shop periodically to buy various upgrades. Plot Story Henry Hatsworth, the game's protagonist, is on a mission to find the lost pieces of the Gentleman's Suit, a suit of armour that allows the wearer to control a parallel world known as the Puzzle Realm, in order to obtain the valuable treasures inside this world. Hatsworth first finds a golden bowler hat that opens a rift between the worlds and allows him to manipulate this realm, and he resolves to find the rest of the Suit pieces to both stop Puzzle Realm monsters from entering his world and to claim their world's riches for himself. Each piece of the Suit gives him different special techniques, but Hatsworth and his assistant Cole find out that only the \\"master piece\\" of the golden suit is strong enough to seal the Puzzle Realm. Hatsworth's rival Weasleby gets it first and claims it has made him a god, but Henry defeats him although Weasleby manages to escape and kidnap Cole. Hatsworth chases after them and eventually defeats Weasleby again, only to discover that Weasleby was a robot. Upset that he never got credit and was always treated like a child and was not allowed to adventure with Hatsworth, Cole built Weasleby and tried to thwart Hatsworth. He sends The Machine, his greatest creation, to fight Hatsworth, but is ultimately defeated and Hatsworth is able to claim the Master Piece and seal the Puzzle Realm. A credits sequence reveals the fates of most of the game's major characters. Worlds Mysteria - a swampy jungle that gives way to a graveyard. Skysland - a combination of floating islands, temple ruins and airships. Atlantia - an ocean with volcanoes and an underwater city. Puzzle Realm - the land unsealed by the Golden Suit; filled with treasures and monsters. Tealand - an old-London style city. Development The concept for Henry Hatsworth started as a prototype in Adobe Flash and was initially called Monkey Business. In a 2009 interview at Nintendo Life with Kyle Gray, where Kyle was asked if it was difficult to get Henry Hatsworth made at EA, Kyle had this to say. \\"Surprisingly, it wasn‚Äôt too bad! I initially pitched the swell gents at Tiburon with a project idea which basically involved me doing some crazy stuff in Flash on my own. Luckily, they totally approved it, so I started making little DS game prototypes‚Äì which gradually led to the Monkey Business prototype, which ultimately became Hatsworth.\\" Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure was created by Kyle Gray, who founded the Experimental Gameplay Project with Kyle Gabler, the creator of World of Goo, in 2005. Gray led a seven-man team at EA Tiburon to develop the game. The seven man team included; Kyle Gray as Director, Peter Ong as Lead Designer, Ryan Pijai as Lead Programmer, Bob Nystrom as Tools Programmer, Andrew Malesky as Animator, Jay Epperson as Art Director and Loel Phelps as Level Designer and Tileset Artist. The art of the game was envisioned by art director Jay Epperson, using a mix of wood grain and paper-cut themes. Soundtrack The original soundtrack of the game, composed by Gene Rozenberg, was released by EA Games for free download on its website. It has since been removed after EA's redesign of the game's website. Reception Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure received \\"favorable\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. IGN's Mark Bozon commented that the game was \\"completely old school in design and execution\\", featuring \\"pop-up brawling, a wall jump that feels like Mega Man X, Mario-like platforming, and a great blend with the puzzle aspects\\". He commended the game's \\"beautiful\\" art style, but criticized the game for technical issues, and called the gameplay \\"unforgiving at times\\". GameSpot's Tom McShea also called both platforming and puzzle aspects \\"first- class\\" and \\"an absolute blast\\", with \\"tight controls and varied environments\\" as well as \\"fast and frantic\\" puzzle gameplay, but was frustrated by \\"the high difficulty in the later stages\\". Henry Hatsworth was nominated for the \\"Outstanding Achievement in Portable Game Design\\" Interactive Achievement Award from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences, and for both Genre Award and Platform Award in GameSpot's Best of 2009.

At a length up to 40 cm, L. maculata is the largest mantis shrimp in the world. L. maculata may be distinguished from its congener L. sulcata by the greater number of teeth on the last segment of its raptorial claw, and by the colouration of the uropodal endopod, the distal half of which is dark in L. maculata but not in L. sulcata. A small artisanal fishery exists for this species.  Hunting Strategies  Stomatopods are distinguished by their unique hunting adaptations, the most obvious being their second maxilliped modified into a powerful raptorial claw. Whether a mantis shrimp is classified as a smasher or a spearer is distinguished based on the form of the raptorial claw and the way in which the mantis shrimp uses it. Spearers have unfolded dactyls that are lined with sharp spines and are especially elongated to reach prey. Smashers on the other hand have folded dactyls that are modified for smashing through their heavily calcified heel.Van Der Wal, C, et al. ‚ÄúThe Evolutionary History of Stomatopoda (Crustacea: Malacostraca) Inferred from Molecular Data.‚Äù Peerj, vol. 5, no. 9, 2017, doi:10.7717/peerj.3844. The Zebra mantis shrimp is an example of a ‚Äúspearing‚Äù mantis shrimp.deVries, M. S., et al. ‚ÄúStrike Mechanics of an Ambush Predator: the Spearing Mantis Shrimp.‚Äù Journal of Experimental Biology, The Company of Biologists Ltd, 15 Dec. 2012, jeb.biologists.org/content/215/24/4374.  Predation  In Prague sea aquarium By hiding in sandy burrows, Lysiosquillina maculata strike soft-bodied evasive prey that swim by such as small fish and malacostracans. In order to create high attack speeds, they have a spring and latch structure at the base of their raptorial appendages that allows them to create a spring-loaded strike. This strike system consists of a four-bar linkage mechanism and a coupled lever. By storing energy in this spring-like system a faster strike is created than would be possible from solely muscle action.Anderson, Philip S. L., et al. ‚ÄúLEVERS AND LINKAGES: MECHANICAL TRADE‚ÄêOFFS IN A POWER‚ÄêAMPLIFIED SYSTEM.‚Äù The Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering, Wiley-Blackwell, 5 May 2014, onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/evo.12407. Prior to attacking prey, Lysiosquillina maculata only peeks its eyes above the entrance to the burrow. As soon as the prey move within striking distance of the burrows, the mantis shrimp lunges out and snares the prey with both of its raptorial appendages. Zebra mantis shrimp attack with a mean peak speed of 2.3 m/s and with a mean duration of 24.98 ms. This speed is significantly slower than those generated by the smashing mantis shrimp, who's strikes can reach 14-23m/s. However, it is similar to those of other aquatic predators attacking evasive prey. This discrepancy, is because spearing mantis shrimp display displacement amplification whereas smashing mantis shrimp display force amplification. This makes sense given their hunting strategies. ‚ÄúSmashers‚Äù need to apply a large amount of force, but easily get close to their sessile, hard-shelled prey. However, for ‚Äúspearers‚Äù like the zebra mantis shrimp, it is more advantageous to have greater reach when targeting prey with their ambush attack strategy. In addition, it has been shown that larger mantis shrimp species strike more slowly, resulting in the slower speeds displayed by Lysiosquillina maculata.Mchenry, M J, et al. ‚ÄúThe Comparative Hydrodynamics of Rapid Rotation by Predatory Appendages.‚Äù The Journal of Experimental Biology, vol. 219, no. Pt 21, 2016, p. 3399., doi:10.1242/jeb.140590.  Eyesight  The class of crustaceans called Stomatopods, which includes Lysiosquillina maculata has the most complex visual receptors in the animal kingdom. Many species are thought to be able to express up to 16 different visual pigments.Cronin, T. W., et al. ‚ÄúThe Molecular Genetics and Evolution of Colour and Polarization Vision in Stomatopod Crustaceans.‚Äù The Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering, Wiley-Blackwell, 25 Aug. 2010, onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1475-1313.2010.00762.x. In addition, Stomatopods have a tripartite cornea which contains upper and lower halves, separated by a middle band made up of ommatidia. These photoreceptors include specialized receptors that can detect a wide range of visible and ultraviolet light, as well as being able to detect linearly and circularly polarized light.Feller, Kathryn D., and Thomas W. Cronin. ‚ÄúSpectral Absorption of Visual Pigments in Stomatopod Larval Photoreceptors.‚Äù SpringerLink, Springer, 14 Jan. 2016, link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00359-015-1063-y. polarized light is used by many insects for navigation, however, in other invertebrates like cephalopods and crustaceans it is used primarily to increase visual contrast and for visual signaling.Templin, Rachel M., et al. ‚ÄúFel.‚Äù Journal of Experimental Biology, The Company of Biologists Ltd, 15 Sept. 2017, jeb.biologists.org/content/220/18/3222.abstract. When searching for prey, each eye moves independently from the other. However, when a prey enters the visual field of one of the eyes, they lock into place focused on the prey.Dore, B., et al. ‚ÄúGrowth and Light/Dark Adaptation in Lysiosquillina Maculata (Stomatopoda, Crustacea).‚Äù Journal of Biological Research, vol. 81, no. 1, 2006, doi:10.4081/jbr.2006.8080.  Behavior  Lysiosquillina maculata display social monogamy with maternal egg care, meaning the females are the ones taking care of the eggs. Social monogamy is usually attributed to the large and costly to construct burrows of these species. These burrows are used for protection, and as a place to hide and wait for prey. In addition, there is a large risk associated with finding mates. Lysiosquillina maculata also displays sexual dimorphism, with males having larger raptorial appendages, although males and females have similar overall body sizes.  Evolution  Lysiosquillina maculata belongs to the crustacean order Stomatopoda. Stomatopoda is made up of three distinct suborders, Palaeostomatopodea, Archaeostomatopodea, and Unipeltata. All living stomatopods belong to the suborder Unipeltata which contains 7 distinct superfamilies of mantis shrimp, made up of almost 500 species. Using molecular clocks, research has shown that around 340 million years ago, stomatopods branched off from their closest crustacean relatives. They also found that the specialized smashing appendage developed around 126 million years ago, after the spearing appendage which arose around 155 million years ago.

The genome encodes 98 to 154 open reading frames. Virions are rod-shaped and when enveloped are up to 382√ó77 nm. The word \\"nudivirus\\" comes from the Latin nudus, which means naked and virus, poison. Naked refers to the fact that, unlike baculoviruses, they weren't thought to be occluded. However occluded nudiviruses such as those of Tipula oleracea and Panaeus monodon have been characterized. Taxonomy In 2007, the genus Nudivirus was proposed to include viruses similar to the Oryctes rhinoceros virus. The nudiviruses were classified as the family Nudiviridae in 2013. Phylogeny All 3 sequenced nudivirus have 33 open reading frames in common. Gene content comparaison and phylogenetic analyses show that Nudivirus share 20 cores genes with baculovirus and form a monophyletic sister group with them. Fossil calibration estimate this association arose 100 million years ago(Mya), while the last common ancestor of BVs, nudivirus, and baculovirus existed approximately 312 Mya. Baculoviruses and nudiviruses differ in gene content, genome organization, cytopathology, infection of adults and most likely in host range. The 20 cores genes common in both Baculovirus and Nudivirus are involved in RNA transcription, DNA replication, virion structural components and many other functions. Gene content and sequence similarity suggest that the nudiviruses GbNV, HzNV-1, and OrNV form a monophyletic group of nonoccluded double-stranded DNA viruses, which separated from the baculovirus lineage before this radiated into dipteran-, hymenopteran-, and lepidopteran-specific clades of occluded nucleopolyhedroviruses and granuloviruses. Virology This genus is characterized by rod-shaped and enveloped nucleocapsids and its members replicate in the nucleus of infected host cells. In some parasitoid wasp species, a nudivirus genome, in proviral form, is integrated the wasp genome and produces virus like particles called polydnaviruses that are injected into lepidopteran larvae and are thought to facilitate parasitization of the larvae (see below). Nudivirus are known to infect preferentially insects and marine arthropods. Transmission of nudiviruses occurs generally by feeding and/or mating. Infections can be lethal for the larvae and can possibly reduce the fitness of the host by reducing offspring production and survival among adults.Unckless RL. (2011) A DNA Virus of Drosophila.

Although, Heliothis zea Nudivirus 1 (HzNV-1 or Hz-1 virus), a relatively broad host range nudivirus, has been shown to block an induced- apoptosis gene (hhi1), and so, prevent his own death. A functional antiapoptosis gene, (Hz-iap2), has been highlighted to suppress the hhi1 gene which can either activate the expression of prodeath gene or alter the cell cycle within the host, resulting in the death of the cell. A second inhibitor gene (Ac-iap2) to the hhi1 gene has been also discovered, Ac-iap2 was speculated to be a nonfunctional iap, raising many questions regarding its functionality. Relation to polydnaviruses in parasitic wasps The parts of the cycle that relate to the transmission of wasp genomic DNA and therefore to proviral DNA are shown by the claret arrows. Those parts of the cycle that apply only to virus replication and assembly/transmission are shown by the green arrows. Polydnavirus (PDVs) are associated to endoparasitic wasps from the Ichneumoninae family (Hymenoptera). There are two genera of PDVs: The ichnoviruses occur in ichneumonid wasps species and bracoviruses in braconid wasps. The polydnaviridae appear to replicate and accumulate in the ovarian calyx epithelial cells and calyx fluid of the wasps and do not replicate in the lepidopteran hosts of the wasps, although their gene products are expressed there. The packaged Virus is injected along with the wasp egg into the body cavity of a lepidopteran host caterpillar and infects cells of the caterpillar. The infection does not lead to replication of new viruses, rather it affects the caterpillar's Immune system. Without the virus infection, Phagocyte Hemocyte (blood cells) will encapsulate and kill the wasp egg but the immune suppression caused by the virus allows for survival of the wasp egg, leading to hatching and complete development of the immature wasp in the caterpillar. Additionally, genes expressed from the polydnavirus in the parasitised host alter host development and metabolism to be beneficial for the growth and survival of the parasitoid larva. Thus the virus and wasp have a Symbiosis (mutualistic) relationship. It appears in most cases that the PDVs DNA is required for successful Parasitism of Lepidoptera by the wasps. So, the full genome of the virus is integrated into the genome of the wasp and the virus only replicates in specific cells in the female wasp's reproductive system. As a result, the polydnaviral DNA has experienced spectacular reproductive success; it is now thought to be represented in species of many ichneumonoid wasps. The conservation of this viral machinery in different braconid wasp lineages sharing polydnaviruses suggests that parasitoid wasps incorporated a nudivirus-related genome into their own genetic material.

Historical development In 1997 representatives from the University of Nottingham and the departments of Occupational Medicine at two Danish hospitals, Skive Syghus and Herning Syghus, wrote an enabling document that laid the foundation for an organizing committee, the purpose of which was to create a European organization dedicated to supporting ‚Äúresearch, teaching and practice‚Äù in OHP. The EA-OHP came into existence in 1999. The organization operated out of the Institute of Work, Health & Organisations, at the University of Nottingham, under Tom Cox's leadership and \\"actively supported by a pan-European team of individuals and institutions.\\" The organization developed working groups in research, teaching, and practice. The EA-OHP‚Äôs leading activity was organizing annual conferences that facilitated the sharing of research findings and educational and practice information. Attendance at the Academy‚Äôs conferences increased steadily. By 2006, the EA- OHP conference series became biennial. By way of an agreement reached in 2008 with their U.S. counterparts in the Society for Occupational Health Psychology (SOHP), the EA-OHP now coordinates its conference series with the APA/NIOSH/SOHP Work, Stress, and Health conference series. The first EA-OHP conference was attended mainly by academics, but the conference series increasingly attracted practitioners and graduate students as well as occupational safety and health practitioners.

This is a bird lovers' paradise, with a wide variety found on the farm. Rarities include African fish eagle, black eagle, blue crane, secretary bird, steppe buzzard, kingfishers and many more. The Orange River has become a fly-fishing mecca due to the abundance of both Yellowfish species. Some of the species found are largemouth yellowfish, smallmouth yellowfish, Orange River mudfish, moggel, sharptooth catfish, chubbthead barb, carp and many more. Location  Oviston Nature Reserve is in the northeastern part of the Eastern Cape Province along the southern shoreline of the mighty Gariep Dam (formerly known as the Hendrik Verwoerd Dam). It covers an area of approximately 16,000 hectare and stretches from the dam wall on the west, to the Bethulie railroad bridge in the east. Oviston and Venterstad are 7 km from the reserve entrance. Lake Gariep Lake Gariep, which spans the borders of the Free State, Eastern Cape and Northern Cape Provinces, lies approximately two hours south of Bloemfontein. The dam is more than 100 km long and 15 km wide with a surface area of about 360km¬≤ and a storage capacity of 5,673,8 million cubic meters. The dam wall is 914 m long and 88 m high. Oviston Oviston is a small town overlooking Lake Gariep on the Eastern Cape side. It was originally built to house the workers who built the dam which was completed in 1971. Nearby reserves Lake Gariep is surrounded by three provincial nature reserves: the Oviston Nature Reserve, the Tussen-die-Riviere Nature Reserve and the Gariep Nature Reserve. The Gariep Nature Reserve is between the dam and Bethulie on the Free State side. The Tussen-die-Riviere Nature Reserve is in the Free State. Oviston Nature Reserve is in the Eastern Cape Province on the southern shores of Lake Gariep. History The land was originally bought by the state for the construction of the dam. In 1968, the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure and Water Affairs ceded control of the property to the provincial authorities. A memorandum has been drafted by the MECs of the three provinces to effectively join the three reserves and create a conservation area in excess of 85,000 hectares. Climate This is a semi-desert area; it can get blindingly hot during the day, followed by nights in which the temperature plummets. Due to this climate, the area is quite dusty which helps to give extraordinary sunsets. The landscape consists of vast, open grassland with low \\"koppies\\" (small mountains) and is part of South Africa's \\"Big Sky\\" country. Rain generally falls as thundershowers between October and March, the rainfall season peaks from February to March. Temperatures are mild for most of the year, with very cold snaps from June to August and periods of intense heat from January to March. During winter, frost is common.

It is located 60 km west of Queenstown, and 30 km south- east of Tarkastad in Eastern Cape Province, South Africa and is managed by Eastern Cape Parks Board. Its western boundary is formed by the upper Black Kei River. The reserve's name originates from the Xhosa word for \\"spike\\", due to the presence of the cone-shaped hill, Spitskop. History Proclaimed in 1979, Tsolwana Nature Reserve was the final result of the state- subsidised stock reduction schemes that were introduced by the government in the severe drought of the late sixties to help protect the soil against erosion. The decreased stock numbers eventually led to an increase of indigenous animals. The area eventually became a conservation area and finally, in 2005, the Eastern Cape Parks Board became responsible for the management of Tsolwana. Climate Tsolwana Nature Reserve marks the start of the Karoo. The climate can be extreme, with greatly varying temperatures and unpredictable heavy summer rainstorms and even hail. Rainfall peaks between January and March. In winter snow falls frequently while cold, wet southerly wind spells can cause wildlife losses, particularly in the plains antelope species. Tsolwana lies within a summer rainfall region, but rainfall is unpredictable and often falls in heavy storms, throughout the year, particularly in November. Seasonal temperatures differ greatly. Daytime temperatures reach 38 ¬∞C in summer while frost occurs in winter. Strong north- westerly winds can be expected from July to September, while frequent south- westerly winds bring rain in summer. Wildlife Located in the Karoo, the reserve is home to many animal species including the white rhino, giraffe, eland, blesbok, mountain reedbuck, Cape mountain zebra, dassie, ant bear (aardvark), bat-eared fox, black backed jackal, baboon, gemsbuck, kudu, lynx, orynx, mongoose and springbok. Birdlife Tsolwana Game Reserve is home to South Africa's national bird, the Blue Crane, as well as the Cape Vulture and Ostrich. Environment Susceptible to soil erosion and land degradation, its altitude sits at 1350m in the lowland regions and 1800m in the mountainous area. Located in the Karoo, the vegetation at the nature reserve is mostly made up of grassy plains and acacia thornveld.

Athletic career Beckwith was a professional sprinter who competed under the Victorian Athletic League (VAL) from 1909‚Äì1934. As both a flat-runner and a hurdler he was most successful during his early years which included a third-place in the 1915 Stawell Gift and a win in the Sprint Handicap (75 yards) at the same meeting. He had won the latter event in 1913 and could have won three in a row had he not submitted an incomplete entry for in 1914. Other wins of note included the 1918 Shepparton Gift and a Wangaratta Gift.Watt. p.82. He was winning races as late as 1930 when he won the Lancefield Gift. In 1938 Beckwith was appointed one of the handicappers for the Stawell meeting and later that same year was appointed as a handicapper for the VAL. Having filled further roles as VAL steward and committee member he was elected president in 1947 and served until 1950. He became an honorary life member of the VAL in 1951 and of the Stawell Athletic Club in 1962. Football career Beckwith played his early football at Clifton Hill and West Melbourne CYMS. He made his only league appearance in the second round of the 1918 VFL season, when he played in Fitzroy's 40-point loss to eventual premiers South Melbourne at Brunswick Street Oval. His son John had a much more successful career, playing in five premiership teams at Melbourne. Umpiring career A knee injury forced Beckwith to retire from playing and he concentrated on athletics for most of the 1920s. It was common for professional athletes to use boundary umpiring as a way of maintaining fitness and Beckwith applied to the VFL in 1928. He was accepted and placed on the list of boundary umpires for that season. He made his debut in the first round officiating at the Richmond versus North Melbourne match earning Heritage Number 152. In two seasons Beckwith officiated in 22 VFL and 4 country matches. His last match was the 1929 Grand Final.Flegg, David. Records. Accessed 30 November 2013. Microsoft Access database.

With a budget of SEK 60,000, it was the most expensive Swedish film made up to that point,Summary at Svenskfilmdatabas.se (in Swedish) Swedish Film Institute marking a new direction in Swedish cinema with more funding to fewer films, resulting in more total quality.Summary of The Outlaw and His Wife at Svenskfilmdatabas.se (in Swedish) Swedish Film Institute This film is considered to be the start of the golden age of Swedish silent film that would end after G√∂sta Berlings saga in 1925, although films such as Ingeborg Holm (1913) are often assigned to this era as well. Plot Terje Vigen lives happily with his wife and little girl on a small island in Norway. In 1809 during the Napoleonic Wars, the town is starving due to the British blockade. Terje decides to row to Denmark to bring food to his family. On the way back, he is captured by a ruthless English captain and sent to jail in England. When the war ends and he is finally freed, Terje finds that his wife and daughter have died. He takes up a solitary life in his house overlooking the sea. One night he sees a British yacht in distress in a storm. He rushes to her help and discovers that the skipper is the same man that had taken him prisoner and destroyed his life many years before. He decides against vengeance and rescues the skipper along with the skipper's wife and child. Cast * Victor Sj√∂str√∂m as Terje Vigen * Edith Erastoff as The Lady * August Falck as The Lord * Bergliot Husberg as Mrs. Vigen Production In Grimstad Norway, while working at a pharmacy, Henrik Ibsen would often listen to the stories of the Norse maritime pilots. He became a close friend to one of the oldest and most experienced pilots, who had lived a remarkable life and had exciting stories to tell the young writer. His name was Svend Hanssen Haa√∏, from the island of Haa√∏ (in modern Norwegian H√•√∏ya). The story of his life is often thought to be an important source for Ibsen when he wrote his poem Terje Vigen. Svend Hanssen Haa√∏'s life contains many of the essential elements of the story of Terje Vigen. Haa√∏ made several trips by rowboat to Denmark through the British blockade, in the years 1807-14, to smuggle food back to his family and friends in Grimstad. The British captured him as many as four times, and some of his crew were put in prison in England as in the poem. The poem was a patriotic ode that experienced a resurgence of popularity following Norway‚Äôs independence from Sweden in 1905. Formerly, very reserved about the possibilities of adapting Henrik Ibsen's works to the screen, ‚ÄúVictor Sjostrom did not see how the style of the Norwegian author could be reconciled with the prevailing fashion for comedies and thrillers.\\"Peter Cowie: The Cinema of the Nordic Countries , Editions du Center Georges-Pompidou , Paris, 1990. Consequently, he did not immediately accede to the wishes expressed by Charles Magnusson (1878-1948), founding director of the Svenska Biograph, who desperately wanted him to film Ibsen's poem. Magnusson had negotiated the rights to the poem from Ibsen‚Äôs son Sigurd in 1915. Later, during a sentimental trip in the region of Varmland, where he spent his childhood, Sjostrom saw his nanny again, who spoke to him about his mother's courage.During this summer, Sj√∂str√∂m also met Edith Erastoff, the English Lady of the film, who became his wife for almost thirty years. Continuing his journey by bicycle, the director arrived in Grimstad on the Norwegian coast, where Ibsen first had the idea of writing the poem. The trip wasn‚Äôt the catalyst for making the movie, as producer Magnusson already had a script by the fall of 1915, written by newcomer (and future director) Gustaf Molander but Sj√∂str√∂m‚Äôs time in the location that inspired Ibsen almost certainly influenced the film‚Äôs conception. When he returned to Stockholm in August 1916, he was ready to shoot the film Magnusson dreamed of.Peter Cowie: The Cinema of the Nordic Countries , Editions du Center Georges-Pompidou , Paris, 1990. In the summer of 1916, Sj√∂str√∂m was scouting locations among the islands of Stockholm‚Äôs outer archipelago, the same general area where he had shot The Sea Vultures. The budget was 60,000 Swedish crowns and shooting began in August and lasted three months. The film was budgeted as one of the most expensive Swedish productions to date, three times more than the average feature. By the standards of its time, A Man There Was was an extremely ambitious film on account of its extensive, incredibly daring seabound sequences. The use of real locations that evoke the majesty and might of nature was an essential component of Sjostrom's art. No visual realization of Ibsen's poem would have worked without stark images of the sea at her most unforgiving. With the camera strapped to boats of various sizes, often venturing out in the most hazardous conditions, Sjostrom's cinematographer Julius Jaenzon manages to give the sea an overwhelming presence in the film, the most powerful manifestation of nature's supremacy over man and its power to guide his destiny. Jaenzon would go on to evoke similar powerful images in 1919's Sir Arne's Treasure.http://www.frenchfilms.org/review/a-man-there- was-1917.html The film also marks a significant development in Sjostrom's technique, with more dramatic camera setups, faster editing, and less reliance on intertitles to carry the story. For the dramatic sequences in which Terje tries to evade capture by the English, crosscutting is used to build tension and heighten emotion. Later, when Terje is confronted by the man who ruined his life, a short flashback is used which prevents the need for a title card. The sea plays a leading role alongside the characters. The sea is not only represented as a poetic beauty of nature, but also as a force against which the characters must fight and survive. Vigen's inner feelings are powerfully visualized by cutaway shots to the sea which becomes a mirror of his soul, capable of far greater expression than the human face could show. The subtitles do not describe the plot or dialogue, but only quote excerpts from Henrik Ibsen's poem. In addition to Kiss of Death (1916), A Man There Was is regarded as an early major work by Victor Sj√∂str√∂m as well as a key work for early Swedish film. The Swedish Film Institute‚Äôs newly color-graded 2006 restoration captures the tinting and toning of the original release, switching in parts from cerulean blue to magenta. The film has a length of 1160 meters and a running time of 59 minutes. Reception The film premiered on January 29, 1917 simultaneously in Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malm√∂, and Copenhagen, with a full program with Ibsen's poems in extenso, posters by the artist Eigil Schwab, and specially composed music.Biografblad 4417 - Terje Vigen¬ª. 1917. When the film was released, public and critical reception was positive. The film received several good reviews in Sweden. World War I prevented the film‚Äôs release outside Scandinavia until 1919. At that time, 43 copies of the film were exported abroad. Victor Sj√∂str√∂m was presented as the greatest director of his time. It wasn‚Äôt until February 1920 that A Man There Was could be seen in the United States. The press raved, with W. Stephen Bush in \\"The Billboard\\" calling it, ‚ÄúTruly a masterpiece,‚Äù and most everyone agreeing with Burns Mantle in Photoplay: ‚ÄúIt is so simple as to story and continuity and cutting and acting that one wonders why some of our output, not nearly so mighty, should use up so much energy and emerge with so much ostentation.‚Äùhttps://silentfilm.org/a-man-there-was/ Another journalist wrote: ‚ÄúSeastrom - (his name in English speaking countries) - should come to America to teach his competitors how to make films.\\"Peter Cowie: The Cinema of the Nordic Countries , Editions du Center Georges-Pompidou , Paris, 1990.The one criticism, nearly universal, was that the intertitles were too dense, leading to the sales agent, L.E. Miller of Radiosoul Films, to place full-page advertisements in the trade publications announcing that the critics‚Äô voices had been heard and the intertitles were being cut down and rewritten. One wonders, though, how much Miller really understood his product given that he placed it as a double feature with Mack Sennett's Down on the Farm, starring Ben Turpin and the dog-and-cat pairing of Teddy & Pepper. To make the evening‚Äôs entertainment complete, the Broadway Theatre included a girlie revue called ‚ÄúThe Ushers‚Äô Quartet,‚Äù featuring four young ladies chosen from the personnel of the various Moss theaters. https://silentfilm.org/a-man-there- was/ Ren√© Jeanne and Charles Ford described this masterpiece as \\"a sort of intimate 'Roland Song' which celebrates the sea and the men who live with it, denounces the cruelty of war and the ambitions of dictators, and which pities all men whom war has taken away from all that they hold dearest in the world and who find themselves alone.\\"R. Jeanne / Ch. Ford: Encyclopedic History of Cinema , 5 vols. Robert Laffont , Paris, 1947. It‚Äôs said that audience members recited stanzas during the screenings, prompted no doubt by intertitles taken directly from the poem, and spectators of the time felt an additional emotional tug given similar blockades then in force in the North Sea due to World War I. Terje Vigen is a fundamental milestone in the director's work. ‚ÄúIt inaugurates the great period of Sj√∂str√∂m. He has definitely found Ibsen's slow pace, his heavy, solemn gait that envelops the natural world in mysticism.World Dictionary of Cinema , Larousse Publishing , 1986 first edition.

The lemma is implicit in the use of piecewise functions. For example, in the book Topology and Groupoids, where the condition given for the statement below is that A \\\\setminus B \\\\subseteq \\\\operatorname{Int} A and B \\\\setminus A \\\\subseteq \\\\operatorname{Int} B. The pasting lemma is crucial to the construction of the fundamental group or fundamental groupoid of a topological space; it allows one to concatenate continuous paths to create a new continuous path.  Formal statement  Let X,Y be both closed (or both open) subsets of a topological space A such that A = X \\\\cup Y, and let B also be a topological space. If f: A \\\\to B is continuous when restricted to both X and Y, then f is continuous. This result allows one to take two continuous functions defined on closed (or open) subsets of a topological space and create a new one. Proof: if U is a closed subset of B, then f^{-1}(U )\\\\cap X and f^{-1}(U )\\\\cap Y are both closed since each is the preimage of f when restricted to X and Y respectively, which by assumption are continuous. Then their union, f^{-1}(U) is also closed, being a finite union of closed sets. A similar argument applies when X and Y are both open. \\\\Box The infinite analog of this result (where A=X_1\\\\cup X_2\\\\cup X_3\\\\cup\\\\cdots) is not true for closed X_1, X_2, X_3\\\\ldots. For instance, the inclusion map \\\\iota:Z\\\\rightarrow R from the integers to the real line (with the integers equipped with the cofinite topology) is continuous when restricted to an integer, but the inverse image of a bounded open set in the reals with this map is at most a finite number of points, so not open in Z. It is, however, true if the X_1, X_2, X_3\\\\ldots form a locally finite collection since a union of locally finite closed sets is closed. Similarly, it is true if the X_1, X_2, X_3\\\\ldots are instead assumed to be open since a union of open sets is open.

They are perhaps best known for creating what is their only surviving film, the silent avant garde classic from 1930, Borderline featuring the African American activist and entertainer Paul Robeson in the lead role.

The Rediscovery of Pool. Retrieved on February 14, 2009. Members and formation The Pool Group was launched in 1927, from Riant Chateau, Territet, Switzerland and consisted of Bryher, Kenneth Macpherson and Hilda Doolittle (better known by her initials, H.D.). Macpherson designed the Pool Group‚Äôs logo, which served as the cover of its catalog, showing concentric ripples in water. Bryher Bryher's father was the shipowner and financier John Ellerman, who left her a very large inheritance which would eventually go towards funding many of Pool's projects. Bryher knew from an early age that she was lesbian. Her wealth enabled her to give financial support to struggling writers, including Joyce and Edith Sitwell. She also helped with finance for the Paris bookshop Shakespeare and Company (started by Sylvia Beach) and certain publishing ventures. She also helped provide funds to purchase a flat in Paris for struggling artist Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven. H.D. H.D. (1886‚Äì1961) was born Hilda Doolittle in Pennsylvania, the daughter of a professor of astronomy and a musically-inclined mother. While still a school- girl she met Ezra Pound, who encouraged her writing and, in 1913, proposed that she adopt the pseudonym H.D. as a pseudonym under which to publish her first poems in Poetry Magazine. At the same time as the problematic relationship with Pound (they were twice engaged) H.D. was carrying on a love affair with a Pennsylvania woman art student, Frances Josepha Gregg. In 1919 H.D. had a daughter, Perdita, by the Scottish composer and music critic Cecil Gray (1895‚Äì1951). It was while she was pregnant that she formed an alliance with Bryher which was to last until H.D.‚Äôs death in 1961. The relationship was an open one, with both taking other partners. In 1921 Bryher entered into a marriage of convenience with the American author Robert McAlmon, whom she divorced in 1927. In 1928, H.D. became pregnant by Kenneth Macpherson, but the pregnancy was terminated later the same year. The complexities of H.D.'s relationships led her to consult the pioneer sexologist Havelock Ellis and to develop a deep interest in psychoanalysis: in the 1930s, she was to be analyzed by Freud, and her interest deeply marked her poems and other writings. Kenneth Macpherson In 1927, Bryher married Kenneth Macpherson, a writer who shared her interest in film and who was at the same time H.D.'s lover. Macpherson, was a young Scottish painter with a passion for film. H.D. seems to have fallen in love with him though Macpherson was evidently exclusively homosexual. In Burier, Switzerland, overlooking Lake Geneva, the couple, along with Doolittle, built a Bauhaus-style structure that doubled as a home and film studio, which they named Kenwin. Bryher and Macpherson also formally adopted H.D.'s young daughter, Perdita, whose name they officially registered as Frances Perdita Macpherson.H.D. Chronology - Louis Silverstein's Close Up Close Up was the Pool Group's main literary output, in the form of a monthly journal. The first issue of Close Up appeared in July 1927, with Macpherson as editor, Bryher as assistant editor, and H.D. and Oswell Blakeston as regular contributors. The first issue announced that next month‚Äôs contributors would be Osbert Sitwell, Havelock Ellis, Andr√© Gide, Dorothy Richardson and Doolittle. As symbol of the group‚Äôs aims, this was explained in their 1929 catalog of publications: \\". . . The expanding ripples from a stone dropped in a pool have become more a symbol for the growth of an idea than a simple matter of hydraulics.. .As the stone will cause a spread of ripples to the water's edge, so ideas once started will go to their unknown boundary. . . . These concentric expansions are exemplified in POOL, which is the source simply - the stone - the idea. POOL is seeking to express new trends and new will. Not, as we have said before, to grind any axe, but to make a centre for new ideas and modern thought.\\" Publications Other publications included books on film to novels and a German-teaching text by Bryher and Trude Weiss called ‚ÄúThe Light-hearted Student‚Äù, exemplifying Bryher‚Äôs idiosyncratic teaching methods. The Pool-books were: Kenneth MacPherson, Pool Reflection (spring 1927); F. L. Black, the pseudonym of Bryher's younger brother John Ellerman Jr.: Why Do They Like It?, with a foreword by Dorothy Richardson (spring 1927), on British public schools; Bryher: Civilians (fall 1927), on World War I; MacPherson's novel Gaunt Island (fall 1927); Oswell Blakeston: Through a Yellow Glass (1928), a complete guide to the cinema Studio; Eric Elliot: Anatomy of a Motion Picture Art (1929), history of cinematography; Bryher: Film Problems of Soviet Russia; Oswell Blakeston's novel: Extra Passenger (1930); Hanns Sachs: Does Capital Punishment Exist? (a pamphlet). Bryher's analyst from 1928 to 1932, Hanns Sachs (1881‚Äì1947) was one of the seven members of Freud's inner circle. Oswell Blakeston Most of the books were by the members of the group which had been expanded by the addition of Oswell Blakeston (n√© Henry Joseph Hasslacher, 1907‚Äì1985) who had started his working life in the cutting rooms at Gaumont British. A contemporary of David Lean, at around 20, Blakeston became a prot√©g√© of Macpherson and went on to a long career as writer and critic. POOL film-making Pool heartily approved much avant-garde work, and had an early enthusiasm for independent and private film-making. Their principal loyalties however were to German cinema, and particularly G.W. Pabst, and to Soviet cinema, outstandingly Eisenstein. At the same time, while dismissing the greater part of British and American film-making as \\"trash\\" they also recognized Hollywood‚Äôs capacity for better things, and hailed as masterpieces films like Greed and The Big Parade. The only extant film still available is Borderline(1930); only fragments survive of Wing Beat (1927) and Foothills (1929). (H.D. was in all three, and Bryher was in Borderline.) 16mm fragments of Wing Beat, Foothills, and \\"Macpherson material,\\" and the complete film, Borderline, can be viewed at the Museum of Modern Art Film Study Center in New York City. Opinions on contemporary cinema Kenneth Macpherson wrote of his views on world cinema in an editorial from the first issue of Close Up that encompassed many of the Pool Group's views, \\"But it was only a glimpse here and there. The Germanic thing was getting across though, curious details, watchfulness, harking on claustrophobia. We filed Germany for future reference and peeped at Vienna. Here again was tripe. Hollywood was better. Italy a shade worse. France tied up in knots on problems of continuity. While England trundled deplorably in wake, the only thing that could be said for it that it didn't seem to mind being a laughing stock. Then we began to hear from Russia. We had got very sick of Russian novels and Russian plays, and in spite of a recrudescence of Russian influence in art and decoration, there was prejudice. But Potemkin and Aelita put an end to that. Russia was getting its finger on something....Cinematography has stuck itself in front of the artist, and the artist wants to work his medium straight. His conflict is with the business manager. He also wants HIS medium straight. The thing one sees in consequence is compromise, and the beginning of a problem. As usual there are ways and means, which we will talk about later. I want first of all to cavil a bit in a general way and work in a bit of analysis and criticism.\\"Macpherson, Kenneth. \\"CLOSE UP No 1, July \\". As Is, By The Editor. 1931. Borderline The film Borderline centers on an interracial love triangle. The main narrative is concerned with racism and is illustrated without any attempt to take a moral standpoint. The film concentrated on the inner psychology of the characters, using a form of montage which had the effect of superimposition. Where the film was not banned by censorship authorities it was unenthusiastically received by the critics, and disappeared for many years. A pristine print exists however in the Swiss Film Archive, which has recently issued it in DVD form, together with V√©ronique Goel‚Äôs documentary Kenwin, about the house which Bryher and Macpherson built at La Tour-de-Peilz. As well as acting in this film, H.D. with Kenneth Macpherson, wrote an explanatory pamphlet to accompany it and to distribute to the audience, a piece later published in Close Up.Mandel, Charlotte. \\"Garbo/Helen: The self-projection of beauty by H.D.\\".

Borderline plot and analysis The story revolves around a guesthouse run by a set of liberal, hedonistic young people sympathetic to the emerging black American culture. In what would have been completely frowned upon at the time, the manageress played by Bryher has given a room to Pete (Paul Robeson) and his light-skinned black wife Adah, played by Robeson‚Äôs real wife at the time Eslanda Robeson. Adah though is having an affair with a white man Thorne (Gavin Arthur), who is also involved with Astrid (played by the poet Hilda Doolittle aka HD). When Adah leaves Thorne to be with her husband Pete, Thorne is distraught and race becomes an issue. Increasingly Pete becomes the scapegoat for the heartache and conflict that follows between Thorne and Adah. When Thorne ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù murders Astrid, the ‚Äúliberal‚Äù Guest House is forced by the authorities to kick Pete out: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what we‚Äôre like,‚Äù admits the sympathetic Manageress resignedly. To an extent, Robeson‚Äôs character could be seen as reductionist in terms of identity as he tends to be photographed in natural surroundings: sometimes with clouds and the sea as backdrops ‚Äì the location set in a Swiss Alps border town is important in this respect. Likewise Pete‚Äôs behavior is stoical even in the most threatening situations. Yet on the other hand this portrays the reality of culture in this period, and besides Pete also is the character that comes out of the situation with the most dignity even when he is asked to leave town.Selwyn, Harris. \\"\\".

During the Second World War, Bryher devoted her money and energies to helping refugees from Nazi Germany, and Kenwin became an important staging post on the flight. During the 1950s, H.D. wrote a considerable amount of poetry, most notably Helen in Egypt (written between 1952‚Äì54), a feminist deconstruction of epic poetry which uses Euripides's play Helen as a starting point for a reinterpretation of the basis of the Trojan War and, by extension, of war itself.Twitchell-Waas, Jeffrey. \\"Seaward: H.D.'s 'Helen in Egypt' as a response to Pound's 'Cantos'\\".

Life  Carl Rudolf was the youngest son of Frederick, who had founded the W√ºrttemberg-Neuenstadt branch in 1649, and his wife Clara Augusta von Braunschweig. The young Duke studied in T√ºbingen and Strassburg. His Grand Tour brought him to Geneva, the south of France, the court of Louis XIV, London and northern Germany.  Military career  Already in 1687 he raised a W√ºrttemberger Regiment, to support the Republic of Venice in their war against the Ottoman Empire in Greece. Carl Rudolf personally led a company of 150 men and fought during two years in Morea and Negroponte, until he was shot in the chest during the Siege of Negroponte. He survived, but the bullet remained in his lungs for the rest of life. When Carl Rudolf returned to W√ºrttemberg in the beginning of 1690, the War of the Grand Alliance had already started. Carl Rudolf entered in Danish service and went to Ireland to support the Protestant William of Orange against the deposed Catholic King James II of England. The commander of the Danish troops was Carl Rudolf's elder brother Ferdinand Wilhelm. Both brothers fought in the victorious Battle of the Boyne. In 1692 both brothers fought the French in Flanders and participated in the battles of Steenkerke and Neerwinden. When the war ended in 1697, the Danish King sent them to present-day Ukraine, where they supported the Polish-Saxon troops in the Polish‚ÄìOttoman War (1683‚Äì1699) against the Turks. In 1700 they fought in the Great Northern War against Sweden, but Denmark was forced to retreat from the war in the same year. One year later the War of Spanish Succession broke out, where France was opposed by a British-Dutch-Habsburg coalition. Denmark supported the coalition and Carl Rudolf was sent at the head of an army of 12,000 men to the Netherlands. For his actions in 1702, he was made a member of the highest Danish honour, the Order of the Elephant. In 1704 he led the Danish troops in the Battle of Blenheim. In the Battle of Ramillies (1706) and Malplaquet (1709) he distinguished himself and played an important part in both victories. By the end of the war, he was in command of the entire Danish Army. In the meanwhile, Denmark had reentered the Great Northern War and Carl Rudolf was ordered to take Stralsund from the Swedish, which he accomplished in 1715 after a long siege.  Ruler in Neuenstadt  In 1716 Carl Rudolf's eldest brother Frederick August died. He had ruled Neuenstadt since 1682. Because Frederick August had left no male successors, and the second brother Ferdinand Wilhelm had died in 1701, the Duchy passed to Carl Rudolf. After 25 years in service, he left the Danish army and returned home. In 1734 he was recalled once more as Generalfeldmarschall of the Holy Roman Empire to defend the Upper Rhine against the French in the War of Polish Succession. In 1737, the Duke of the main line of the house of W√ºrttemberg, Carl Alexander, died unexpectedly in Stuttgart. His son Carl Eugen was only 9 years old, and Carl Rudolf was appointed Regent. Carl Alexander had left the Duchy in a disastrous financial state and was hated by the population. To prevent an uprising, Carl Rudolf accused the Jewish Finance-minister, Joseph S√º√ü Oppenheimer, and had him executed. Shortly after, Carl Rudolf passed on the Regency to Carl Friedrich of W√ºrttemberg-Oels, for health reasons. Carl Rudolf died of catarrh in November 1742, and was buried in the Nikolauskirche in Neuenstadt am Kocher. Carl Rudolf never married, but lived together with Marie Therese de La Country. They had no children.

The title Lord High Steward of Norway which he held in 1514‚Äì1515 was most probably an honorary title that was awarded for the trip during the summer of 1515, when he played a role in the delegation that retrieved Christian II's future wife Isabella of Burgundy (1501‚Äì1526). Prior to his marriage with Ingerd, he had a son Henrik Nielss√∏n (1500‚Äì1567), who was a magistrate and ecclesiastical cannon. Together with Ingerd, Nils had five daughters. The latest members of the family used the name Gyldenl√∏ve, based on his arms: a golden lion on a checkered field. It is not known whether Nils himself used this name. He is in modern times sometimes, retroactively, referred to as ‚ÄòNils Henriksson (Gyldenl√∏ve)‚Äô.

Andrew Boyle was credited as the editor.Walsh pp. 64‚Äì65 A second edition was published in 1931‚Äì2. The title was slightly different, changing from The Everyman Encyclopedia to Everyman's Encyclopaedia. This set had 12 volumes, 7 million words, 9,000 pages and 50,000 articles. There was also an optional atlas volume. Athelstan Ridgway was credited as the editor.Walsh p. 65 The third edition was published in 1950, again under Ridgways direction, and published in London by Dent, but now in New York by Macmillan Publishers. This change was reflected in the fourth edition, in 1958, that was published as Macmillan's Everyman's Encyclopaedia in the US.Walsh p. 65 The Macmillan's Everyman's Encyclopaedia had 12 volumes, 9 million words and was edited by Ernest Franklin Bozman. Because of its British focus and difficult system of abbreviation it was not recommended for family use, but was considered ideal for schools and libraries. A fifth edition was published in May 1967. Some of the basic format was similar, with 12 volumes and 8 million words, the text was extensively revised, more illustrations were added and the typeface increased one third in size.Walsh p. 97 In the United States this was published as the International Everyman's Encyclopedia, in 20 volumes with one million words more that its UK counterpart. The 1978 sixth edition was not sold in the United States because of copyright issues with the illustrations.

He was sometimes called Ptaszek (Polish for \\"Bird\\"): a reference to his name (which means \\"bird\\" in German) and to the many years that he traveled almost continuously.  Biography  His father was a chef for Prince Micha≈Ç Fryderyk Czartoryski and died while Zygmunt was still a small child. After that, he and his mother came under the care of the Prince. When he was older, he was sent to Warsaw to study science with the aim of becoming an architect. At the age of sixteen, however, Stanis≈Çaw Potocki (who had just returned from Rome and would later become a prominent art collector) introduced him to the works of Bernardo Bellotto. The East Gate in Wilno Vogel decided that he would rather be a cityscape painter. He was admitted to the Royal School of Painting, under the direction of Marcello Bacciarelli. At first, he created works in Bellotto's style, on commission from Count Micha≈Ç Jerzy Mniszech, but soon developed his own style to create scenes of Warsaw. Rather than using oils, he used watercolors, ink and pencil. In 1787, he gained the patronage of King Stanis≈Çaw II August.Biographical notes @ Internetowa encyklopedia PWN. His first commission involved travelling to Krzeszowice, Alwernia, Olkusz, Rabsztyn, Pieskowa Ska≈Ça and other locations to collect historical materials. Upon his return, he used his sketches to create an album of 63 drawings and watercolors, which were published in 1806 by Jan Zachariasz Frey (together with some of his own engravings, based on Vogel's drawings). After that, he was dispatched to Danzig (now Gda≈Ñsk) and spent two years there, although few of his paintings from that period survive. In the following years, he traveled throughout the country, painting castles, towns and estates. His first cycle of ten works was commissioned by his old acquaintance, Potocki, for a new summer residence near Olesin. Despite his wanderings, he participated in the King's Thursday Dinners whenever possible. After the King's abdication, Vogel was forced to seek regular employment. He began as a teacher at the Warsaw Lyceum. In 1817, he was named to the chair for perspective in the Department of Fine Arts at the University of Warsaw; a position he retained for the rest of his life. Among his best-known students were Aleksander Kokular and Franciszek Pfanhauser. In 1818, he was awarded the Order of Saint Stanislaus.Stanis≈Çaw ≈Åoza, Kawalerowie orderu ≈õw. Stanis≈Çawa (1.

Afghanistan, 2nd century CE The ≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama SamƒÅdhi S≈´tra (Sanskrit; ) is an early Mahayana sutra of Indian origin which focuses on the transcendental nature, supernatural powers, and transformational feats bestowed upon the meditation practitioner by the state of meditation called the \\"≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama SamƒÅdhi\\" or the \\"SamƒÅdhi of the Heroic Progression.\\" History The ≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama SamƒÅdhi S≈´tra was translated from the Sanskrit into Chinese by KumƒÅrajƒ´va probably between 402 and 409 C.E. and was later translated into Tibetan by Sakyaprabha and Ratnaraksita at the beginning of the 9th century. Contents The nature of the Buddha Professor Lamotte describes the nature of the Buddha in this sutra as follows: Powers of the Buddha The sutra describes the 100 powers and abilities which the Buddha or 10th-level Bodhisattvas can perform, while operating from within this samƒÅdhi state. Amongst the wonders which the Buddha can perform whilst in this state of ≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama SamƒÅdhi are: * The projection or conjuration of 84,000 other Buddhas, identical replicas of himself and equally real * Complete purification of individual mind and ability to purify the mind of others * Universal omniscience * True knowledge regarding the mechanism of cause and effect without mental obstruction * Knowledge regarding the dissipation of mental defilement, such as anger and lust * Elimination of unnecessary mental activity and complete elimination of defilements * Harmonious renunciation of worldly life * Being able to access and understand different existential forms * Being able to change sex at will without mental confusion * Always knowing the right moral path to proceed * Placing immense Buddha Paradises (universes) into a single pore of the skin * Always presiding over the superknowledges (abhijna) * Always emitting rays of light over all universes without exception * Being able to speak and understand all languages of all universes * Completely avoiding all evil paths * Possessing a knowledge which is profound and unfathomable Knowledge of the Dharmadhatu Part of that profound and unfathomable knowledge is that all dharmas (things) have their basis in the dharma-dhatu - the Totality of all that is, the All. In this sense, there is non-duality that characterises everything, since everything is possessed of the 'one flavour' of the dharma-dhatu. The Buddha states: Attributes of a Buddha The Buddha remarks in the ≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama SamƒÅdhi S≈´tra that any being who cultivates this samadhi will be able to know through pratyatmajnanam, \\"through personal experience,\\" through knowing directly within oneself, all the attributes of a buddha. Amongst those attributes is sovereignty over all humans and gods. The Buddha states of great bodhisattvas and buddhas who possess this samadhi: A bodhisattva who is immersed in this samadhi also rises beyond birth and death. The Buddha comments: Blessings Even the writing down, studying and teaching of this ≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama SamƒÅdhi by a master of Dharma will bestow immense blessings, twenty in number. These include: * Inconceivable knowledge and wisdom, * Inconceivable vision of all the buddhas, and * Inconceivable virtues and sovereign powers. One of these powers is demonstrated by the future Buddha, Maitreya, who transforms himself into innumerable different types of leading spiritual personages in countless world-systems at the same time. Commenting on the great qualities of those such as Maitreya who preside over the ≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama SamƒÅdhi, a whole host of great Bodhisattvas declare in the presence of the Buddha: MahƒÅyƒÅna MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ·πáa S≈´tra This particular samadhi is equally praised in the MahƒÅyƒÅna MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ·πáa S≈´tra, where the Buddha explains that this samadhi is the essence of the nature of the Buddha, and is indeed the \\"mother of all Buddhas.\\" The Buddha also comments that the ≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama SamƒÅdhi additionally goes under several other names, specifically: * Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ (Perfection of Wisdom) * Vajra Samadhi (Diamond Samadhi) * Simhanada Samadhi (Lion's Roar samadhi) * Buddhasvabhava (Buddha essence).

Opposed by many of the Greater Buenos Aires-area Mayors primarily because Sol√° broke with tradition by naming a Cabinet Chief from outside the metro area (home to two out of three residents in the Province of Buenos Aires), Randazzo largely limited himself to his role as the Governor's political adviser. The Legislature's rejection of Gustavo Lopetegui as President of the Bank of the Province of Buenos Aires (the nation's second- largest) in December 2005 led Randazzo to recommend the relatively young Mart√≠n Lousteau to the powerful post, a decision that reaped Sol√° benefits when Lousteau successfully negotiated a US$65 million debt the institution owed Spain's Banco Santander. Following outgoing President N√©stor Kirchner's decision to transfer the Interior Ministry's traditional aegis over law enforcement to the Justice Ministry (leaving Interior focused on political affairs), newly elected President Cristina Kirchner, on Governor Sol√°'s recommendation, appointed Randazzo Interior Minister upon taking office on 10 December 2007. Randazzo ordered Society of St. Pius X Bishop Richard Williamson to leave the country within ten days on February 19, 2009, following recent comments the bishop made to Swedish television, espousing Holocaust denial. 2015 general election candidacy In early 2015 he has announced his intention to run for the 2015 general elections as a precandidate for the presidency of the nation as part of the incumbent Frente para la Victoria party.

It was one of the 48 constellations described by the 2nd century AD astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations today. Its name is Latin for twins, and it is associated with the twins Castor and Pollux in Greek mythology. Its symbol is 18px (Unicode ‚ôä). Location The constellation Gemini as it can be seen with the unaided eye, with added connecting lines. An animation of the constellation Gemini (center), \\"the twins\\", shows two parallel stick figures.

Rey, 1952‚Äì1980, . Gemini lies between Taurus to the west and Cancer to the east, with Auriga and Lynx to the north and Monoceros and Canis Minor to the south. In classical antiquity, Cancer and not Gemini was the location of the Sun on the first day of summer (June 21). During the first century AD, axial precession shifted it into Gemini. In 1990, the location of the Sun on the first day of summer moved from Gemini into Taurus, where it will remain until the 27th century AD and then move into Aries. The Sun will move through Gemini from June 21 to July 20 through 2062.https://www.livescience.com/4667-astrological-sign.html Gemini is prominent in the winter skies of the northern Hemisphere and is visible the entire night in December-January. The easiest way to locate the constellation is to find its two brightest stars Castor and Pollux eastward from the familiar ‚ÄúV‚Äù shaped asterism (the open cluster Hyades) of Taurus and the three stars of Orion‚Äôs belt. Another way is to mentally draw a line from the Pleiades star cluster located in Taurus and the brightest star in Leo, Regulus. In doing so, an imaginary line that is relatively close to the ecliptic is drawn, a line which intersects Gemini roughly at the midpoint of the constellation, just below Castor and Pollux. When the Moon moves through Gemini, its motion can easily be observed in a single night as it appears first west of Castor and Pollux, then aligns, and finally appears east of them. Features Stars The constellation contains 85 stars of naked eye visibility.Elijah H.

Castor's Bayer designation as \\"Alpha\\" arose because Johann Bayer did not carefully distinguish which of the two was the brighter when he assigned his eponymous designations in 1603. Œ± Gem (Castor) is a sextuple star system 52 light-years from Earth, which appears as a magnitude-1.6 blue-white star to the unaided eye. Two spectroscopic binaries are visible at magnitudes 1.9 and 3.0 with a period of 470 years. A wide-set red dwarf star is also a part of the system; this star is an Algol-type eclipsing binary star with a period of 19.5 hours; its minimum magnitude is 9.8 and its maximum magnitude is 9.3. Œ≤ Gem (Pollux) is an orange-hued giant star of magnitude 1.14, 34 light-years from Earth. Pollux has an extrasolar planet revolving around it, as do two other stars in Gemini, HD 50554, and HD 59686. Œ≥ Gem (Alhena) is a blue-white hued star of magnitude 1.9, 105 light- years from earth. Œ¥ Gem (Wasat) is a long-period binary star 59 light-years from Earth. The primary is a white star of magnitude 3.5, and the secondary is an orange dwarf star of magnitude 8.2. The period is over 1000 years; it is divisible in medium amateur telescopes. Œµ Gem (Mebsuta), a double star, includes a primary yellow supergiant of magnitude 3.1, nine hundred light- years from Earth. The optical companion, of magnitude 9.6, is visible in binoculars and small telescopes. Œ∂ Gem (Mekbuda) is a double star, whose primary is a Cepheid variable star with a period of 10.2 days; its minimum magnitude is 4.2 and its maximum magnitude is 3.6. It is a yellow supergiant, 1,200 light-years from Earth, with a radius that is 60 times solar, making it approximately 220,000 times the size of the Sun. The companion, a magnitude-7.6 star, is visible in binoculars and small amateur telescopes. Œ∑ Gem (Propus) is a binary star with a variable component. 380 light-years away, it has a period of 500 years and is only divisible in large amateur telescopes. The primary is a semi-regular red giant with a period of 233 days; its minimum magnitude is 3.9 and its maximum magnitude is 3.1. The secondary is of magnitude 6. Œ∫ Gem is a binary star 143 light-years from Earth. The primary is a yellow giant of magnitude 3.6; the secondary is of magnitude 8. The two are only divisible in larger amateur instruments because of the discrepancy in brightness. ŒΩ Gem is a double star divisible in binoculars and small amateur telescopes. The primary is a blue giant of magnitude 4.1, 550 light-years from Earth, and the secondary is of magnitude 8. 38 Gem, a binary star, is also divisible in small amateur telescopes, 84 light-years from Earth. The primary is a white star of magnitude 4.8 and the secondary is a yellow star of magnitude 7.8. U Gem is a dwarf nova type cataclysmic variable discovered by J. R. Hind in 1855. Mu Gem (Tejat) is the Bayer designation for a star in the northern constellation of Gemini. It has the traditional name Tejat Posterior, which means back foot, because it is the foot of Castor, one of the Gemini twins.

It has an area of approximately 0.2 square degrees, the same size as the full moon. Its high magnitude means that M35 is visible to the unaided eye under dark skies; under brighter skies it is discernible in binoculars. The 200 stars of M35 are arranged in chains that curve throughout the cluster; it is 2800 light-years from Earth. Another open cluster in Gemini is NGC 2158. Visible in large amateur telescopes and very rich, it is more than 12,000 light-years from Earth. NGC 2392 is a planetary nebula with an overall magnitude of 9.2, located 4,000 light-years from Earth. In a small amateur telescope, its 10th magnitude central star is visible, along with its blue- green elliptical disk. It is said to resemble the head of a person wearing a parka. The Medusa Nebula is another planetary nebula, some 1,500 light-years distant. Geminga is a neutron star approximately 550 light-years from Earth. Other objects include NGC 2129, NGC 2158, NGC 2266, NGC 2331, NGC 2355, and NGC 2395. Meteor showers The Geminids are a bright meteor shower that peaks on December 13‚Äì14. It has a maximum rate of approximately 100 meteors per hour, making it one of the richest meteor showers. The Epsilon Geminids peak between October 18 and October 29 and have only been recently confirmed. They overlap with the Orionids, which make the Epsilon Geminids difficult to detect visually. Epsilon Geminid meteors have a higher velocity than Orionids. Mythology Gemini as depicted in Urania's Mirror, a set of constellation cards published in London c.1825. Sculpture showing Castor and Pollux, the legend behind the third astrological sign in the Zodiac and the constellation of Gemini In Babylonian astronomy, the stars Castor and Pollux were known as the Great Twins. The Twins were regarded as minor gods and were called Meshlamtaea and Lugalirra, meaning respectively 'The One who has arisen from the Underworld' and the 'Mighty King'. Both names can be understood as titles of Nergal, the major Babylonian god of plague and pestilence, who was king of the Underworld.Babylonian Star-lore by Gavin White, Solaria Pubs, 2008, page 125 In Greek mythology, Gemini was associated with the myth of Castor and Pollux, the children of Leda and Argonauts both. Pollux was the son of Zeus, who seduced Leda, while Castor was the son of Tyndareus, king of Sparta and Leda's husband. Castor and Pollux were also mythologically associated with St. Elmo's fire in their role as the protectors of sailors. When Castor died, because he was mortal, Pollux begged his father Zeus to give Castor immortality, and he did, by uniting them together in the heavens. Visualizations Diagram of H. A. Rey's alternative way to connect the stars of the constellation Gemini. Twins are shown holding hands. Gemini is dominated by Castor and Pollux, two bright stars that appear relatively very closely together forming an o shape, encouraging the mythological link between the constellation and twinship. The twin above and to the right (as seen from the Northern Hemisphere) is Castor, whose brightest star is Œ± Gem; it is a second-magnitude star and represents Castor's head. The twin below and to the left is Pollux, whose brightest star is Œ≤ Gem (more commonly called Pollux); it is of the first magnitude and represents Pollux's head. Furthermore, the other stars can be visualized as two parallel lines descending from the two main stars, making it look like two figures. H. A. Rey has suggested an alternative to the traditional visualization that connected the stars of Gemini to show twins holding hands. Pollux's torso is represented by the star œÖ Gem, Pollux's right hand by Œπ Gem, Pollux's left hand by Œ∫ Gem; all three of these stars are of the fourth magnitude. Pollux's pelvis is represented by the star Œ¥ Gem, Pollux's right knee by Œ∂ Gem, Pollux's right foot by Œ≥ Gem, Pollux's left knee by Œª Gem, and Pollux's left foot by Œæ Gem. Œ≥ Gem is of the second magnitude, while Œ¥ and Œæ Gem are of the third magnitude. Castor's torso is represented by the star œÑ Gem, Castor's left hand by Œπ Gem (which he shares with Pollux), Castor's right hand by Œ∏ Gem; all three of these stars are of the fourth magnitude. Castor's pelvis is represented by the star Œµ Gem, Castor's left foot by ŒΩ Gem, and Castor's right foot by Œº Gem and Œ∑ Gem; Œµ, Œº, and Œ∑ Gem are of the third magnitude. The brightest star in this constellation is Pollux. In the history of astronomy In Meteorologica (1 343b30) Aristotle mentions that he observed Jupiter in conjunction with and then occulting a star in Gemini. This is the earliest-known observation of this nature.Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning by Richard Hinckley Allen, Dover, 1963, page 229 A study published in 1990 suggests the star involved was 1 Geminorum and the event took place on 5 December 337 BC. When William Herschel discovered Uranus on 13 March 1781 it was located near Œ∑ Gem.Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning by Richard Hinckley Allen, Dover, 1963, page 236 In 1930 Clyde Tombaugh exposed a series of photographic plates centred on Œ¥ Gem and discovered Pluto.The Cambridge Guide to the Constellations by Michael E. Bakich, Cambridge University Press, 1995, page 210 Equivalents In Chinese astronomy, the stars that correspond to Gemini are located in two areas: the White Tiger of the West (Ë•øÊñπÁôΩËôé, Xƒ´ FƒÅng B√°i H«î) and the Vermillion Bird of the South (ÂçóÊñπÊú±ÈõÄ, N√°n FƒÅng Zh≈´ Qu√®). Astrology , the Sun appears in the constellation Gemini from June 21 to July 20. In tropical astrology, the Sun is considered to be in the sign Gemini from May 21 to June 22, and in sidereal astrology, from June 16 to July 15.

Hart, Gertrude Claire, Charles K. French, Louise Glaum, and Bessie Love. Directed by William S. Hart and produced by Thomas H. Ince, the screenplay was written by C. Gardner Sullivan. Although Hart was assisted by Reginald Barker and Clifford Smith, he mostly directed the film by himself. Hart's combined salary as actor and director was $150 per week (). A partial print of the film survives in the Library of Congress, which was restored at the Museo del Cine Pablo Ducr√≥s Hicken in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  Plot  Denton (Hart) and Mary Jane (Love). A hard working miner, Steve Denton (Hart), has become rich from years of prospecting. He takes his fortune and leaves to visit his ill mother, Mrs. Denton (Claire). In the town of Yellow Ridge, however, he is detained by a seductive dance hall girl named Trixie (Glaum). Also known as \\"the firefly,\\" Trixie not only cheats him out of his gold, but also conceals a message that was wired to him by his dying mother. Learning the next day that his mother is dead, Denton is infuriated about being cheated and betrayed by Trixie, who pretended to be good, and other false friends. In his rage, he kills Trixie's lover, Chip Emmett (Mayall), and kidnaps her. Dragging her by the hair of her head, he takes her into the desert. Enslaving Trixie in his desert hideaway, Denton turns his back on \\"white civilization.\\" He hates all white men and women and assumes the leadership of a band of Indian and Mexican bandits. Two years later, a wagon train of Mississippi farmers who are lost and dying in the desert appeal to Denton for help. He refuses to assist them. He is secretly visited that night by Mary Jane Garth (Love), an innocent and virtuous young woman among the migrants who bravely confronts the Indians and Mexicans. She pleads their cause and expresses her belief that no white man would refuse to protect a woman in distress. Deeply moved, Denton is redeemed. He guides the wagon train out of the desert and then resumes his wanderings.  Cast   Production  Hart was given a screenplay by the screenwriter C. Gardner Sullivan in which the hero had, according to Hart, \\"no motive for his hardness.\\" He argued that the audience needed an explanation. Sullivan preferred the idea that his ruthless personality was simply a given, but eventually accepted Hart's wishes. Although it was made during the silent era, Sullivan wrote long speeches for the actors to perform, which were filmed and later edited down. Love as Mary Jane Garth Hart wanted Mae Marsh for the role as Mary Jane, but Marsh was working on a D. W. Griffith movie at the time. Griffith recommended a new actress, Bessie Love. The movie was made at the height of Hart's career, but was unusual because he played a ruthless individual described as \\"hard as flint.\\" As the title suggests, the movie draws on racial ideologies of the era. Hart stated that the central character, Steve Denton, was \\"a white man, who, foreswearing his race, makes outlaw Mexicans his comrades and allows white women to be attacked by them.\\" The film was made at Inceville and Sulphur Canyon.  Reception  Magazine advertisement Contemporaneous reviews of the film were glowingly positive. The photography, acting, and direction were all positively reviewed. Hart himself believed this movie to be \\"one of the best Westerns ever made.\\" However, later assessments of the film have been critical of its treatment of race. Of the film, Andrew Brodie Smith wrote, \\"Racism was not new to the but it had never been articulated in such a sophisticated fashion.\\" Other scholars have labeled this as \\"perhaps the first film to openly proclaim the doctrine of White supremacy over Native American Indians\\".

Scared of the bandits that plague these parts, especially after a brief encounter with them, the two are glad to find an inn in the middle of the forest. However, it turns out that they have wandered into a den of thieves. The owners are in league with the bandits, who this very night plan to abduct Franziska, the Comtesse von Sandau, who is travelling through the forest with a group including her fianc√©, Baron Sperling. Their coach is waylaid by a trap and the bandits direct them to the nearby inn. The waitress warns the journeymen of impending danger and they pass on the warning to the nobles.

When Graf Sandau finds out that the Comtesse has gone to the bandits he sends Baron Sperling to the inn with the ransom money. The soldiers shadow him but the plan to follow the bandits back to their lair fails. Meanwhile, at the bandits' lair, their corporal finds out that the \\"Comtesse\\" they have imprisoned is a man. Franziska, on the pretense that she wants to find out the truth about the prisoner, switches back places with Felix, which saves his life but makes her a prisoner. The corporal wants to kill her and a confrontation ensues. The leader sides with the prisoners and during the fight, the parson escapes. The soldiers find the bandits' lair, but the leader snatches the Comtesse and rides off. Franziska conceals the bandit leader in her father's castle. He reveals to her that he is in fact the son of an Italian Count from whom Graf Sandau borrowed money in the past, which he never repaid. After his father's death he came to Germany to regain his money from Graf Sandau, but before he could do so he was taken prisoner by the bandits. They forced him to join their band and eventually he became their leader. The planned abduction of the Comtesse was intended to make Graf Sandau finally pay the money he owed. The soldiers search the castle and the bandit leader flees. However, he returns and elopes with Franziska who was about to marry Baron Sperling‚Äîa purely financial match set up by her father. The bandit leader/count takes Franziska in lieu of the money he is owed and they drive off in a wagon.

Curt Hanno Gutbrod also worked on the script. An earlier film version of Hauff's story had been released in 1923, directed by Adolf Wenter and starring Friedrich Berger and Ellen K√ºrty. The film was shot at the Bavaria Studios in Munich with sets designed by the art directors Robert Herlth and Kurt Herlth. Schloss Mespelbrunn, actually located within the Spessart hills, was used as the castle of Graf Sandau. Another location was the market square of Miltenberg, a town between the Spessart and the Odenwald. Release The Spessart Inn premiered on 15 January 1958 at the Gloria-Palast in Berlin. The film was entered into the 1958 Cannes Film Festival and nominated for the Palme d'Or. Kurt Hoffmann's The Haunted Castle and Glorious Times at the Spessart Inn were sequels of a sort to this film. Reception The Filmbewertungsstelle awarded the film Pr√§dikat: Wertvoll. It also received the in 1958. In 1960 it was awarded a \\"Bambi\\" for \\"Artistically Best Film of the Year\\" and in 1961 the Preis der deutschen Filmkritik for \\"Best Film\\". Liselotte Pulver received the Filmband in Silber for \\"Best Actress\\" at the Deutscher Filmpreis in 1958 for her role as Franziska. The Lexikon des internationalen Films calls the film \\"a colourful, delightfully spooky and cheerful film with a parodistic touch\\". More recently, theatres in several towns in Germany, including Mespelbrunn, Fulda or Donauw√∂rth have staged plays/musicals that were based on the film or at least included some of the elements it had added to Hauff's original story.

Biography Early years Kannur was born on 18 September 1909 on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi (Bhadrapad Shukla Chaturthi), in a Deshastha Brahmin family of Smt Saraswatibai & Shrimant Shivrampant Kannur, in the small village Kannur, located in the Bijapur district of Karnataka, India. He had his primary and high-school education in Bijapur. He graduated in 1932, earning a B.Sc. (mathematics and physics) degree from Fergusson College, Pune. Sri Siddharameshwar Maharaj Since his early childhood days, Kannur had a great inclination towards spirituality. At the age of 13 he was blessed and initiated by Sri S.S. Siddharameshwar Maharaj, who also accepted him as his disciple and guided him to the path of self attainment. Maharaj had given stringent directives to few of his selfless disciples: to wear ochre robes, to be devoted towards sadhana and make it the sole objective of life, not to touch money, and live with only bare minimum necessities. The disciples chose the bank of river Krishna at AudumbarAudumbar Sri Narasimha Saraswati, Shreeswami.org and carried out tapas (penance) for a year, strictly as instructed. Further study Even being a graduate he decided not to take any service or job and wowed for the bow of celibacy throughout his life as not to get entangled in materialistic life. Maharaj died in 1936. After his death, Shri Ganapatrao Maharaj became firmly rooted in his doctrines, and studied the Shrimad Dasbodh, Bhagavata, Bhagavad-Gita Upanishads and other holy texts to attain the highest goal of his life - self liberation and self attainment. Teaching others He carried on the mantle passed to him by his Sadguru, and strived for the uplifting of common people for 60 years. To carry forward his spiritual work he founded the Shanti Kuteer Ashram.Biography of Shri S S Ganapatrao Maharaj Kannur At the age of 95, on Monday 20 September 2004, he died in Kannur House, Bijapur. Personality The motto of his life was to propagate the principles of Advaita and preach the importance of gaining liberation - mukti in this birth itself and showing the path of self-realization (atmanubhuti) to all who came to him. He was an individual with high intellect, with a very simple lifestyle, and the immense ability of loving all eternal humans without any differentiation of religion, caste or creed. People were instantly attracted by his loving, peaceful nature and enlightening discourses those who all came in his contact were very much impressed with his simplicity, selfless state & divine aura, which earned him the reverence as \\"Shanti Bramha\\". Teachings Maharaj preached the principle of advaita, the importance of self-satisfaction, and the way to lead a happy and content life in eternal peace. His teaching, in a nut shell, was Aham brahmƒÅsmi, \\"I am Bramha\\", Atma is supreme - Bramha. He focused on how an individual who has conquered his ego can be eternally free in his birth itself. The supreme eminence of his teaching was that he explained this systematically in a simple language, so as even a common man could understand and follow it easily. Some key topics which Maharaj elucidated were: * The importance of this birth as a human being. * The atma is supreme it is sat ‚Äì chit ‚Äì anand meaning it is the ultimate truth, it is ever existent never to be destroyed and it is in the form of happiness. * An individual is not what he seems to be ‚Äì neither the body neither the mind nor the self. He is the ultimate atma (soul) ‚Äì the ultimate supreme: therefore every being is full of anand (bliss) in his basic state, which should be experienced. * The attainment of self enlightenment can be achieved by loving all and incinerating hatred towards others. * The importance of evicting self-centered lifestyle and relinquishing ego. * To be always content in self happiness and see all as self and love all. * The need to take up spiritual path of the fourfold sadhanas. * The importance of listening to discourses cogitation of what is heard and bringing it into practice. * Liberation from sufferings, hatred, selfish ego and achieving the supreme happiness means salvation. Social setup Maharaj was very much concerned about the changing lifestyles and diluting principles and human values. To counter these aspects, and implement the principles of adhyatma in day-to-day life, he founded a social organization called Bharatiya Surajya Samstha in 1993. A spiritual aspirant (sadhaka) of the highest order certainly has at least a tinge of materialism in him, likewise the most worldly-minded person is sure to have at least a tinge of spiritual awareness in him. The goal of every man is to achieve a balance of these two facets. Every worldly-minded person should adopt spiritual values in his life. Every spiritually-minded person should develop the awareness that the world is present in the background. Maharaj preached this beautiful state of equanimity. There are eight principles which are preached through Bhartiya Surajya Samstha (BSS): # I will never take part in habit-forming activities like drinking, smoking and others. # I will not engage myself in unethical acts like adultery, viewing lewd shows and others. # I will practice the edict of \\"high thinking and simple living\\" in my daily life. # I will buy and use only the outputs of our own country-men. # I will observe the creed of non-violence and lead my life in harmony with everyone. # I will go to a needy village or to my own place one day in a week and perform voluntary service. # I will never take or give bribes. # I will earmark two hours every day for spiritual practice of those Sadhanas which lead to the highest goal in life. To preach and to spread the message of BSS the disciples of Maharaj carry walkathons in rural and urban areas every year known as BSS \\"Neeti Bhakti Dindi Yatra\\". The BSS is also actively involved to give quality education in villages and helping them improve in every possible. This scheme called \\"School Adoption\\" was started by the Government of Karnataka. Eleven schools have been adopted under Maharaj's direction and received help in every possible way. \\"Liberation in life and value considerations should not be restricted but it should extend to the society and the nation and the world over\\" is the great message that has been given to civilization by the Samstha. He was also the originator of a bi-weekly publication known as Surajya Path and was a regular writer till his last days. Every Sadhaka should lead life for the good of his own, his society and the nation. It is no exaggeration to say the nation has been uplifted because of the presence of such great Mahatmas and more so by our Sadguru. Shanti Kuteer Ashram Shanti Kuteer Ashram Shanti Kuteer is a hermitage founded by Maharaj. It is located near the village of Kannur, 25 km from Bijapur. This ashram was set up in 1951 and has gradually grown to consist of over 100 rooms for accommodation of the disciples. A temple of Lord Shree Dattatreya is located on the premises. Maharaj built small cottage on his ancestral land named it Shanti Kuteer. Starting with a small cottage in 1951, Shanti Kuteer expanded into a concrete structure in 1961. It became the centre for all his spiritual activities and soon gained the status of Teertha Kshetra. In a span of 60 years it has grown into a big spiritual centre with over 100 well maintained rooms, a huge auditorium where discourses are given and the Saptahs (spiritual fests) are celebrated, a dining hall that can seat thousands of devotees and other amenities. At Shanti Kuteer, no distinction is made on the basis of caste, creed, color, age, language or any other criteria. All those with sincere spiritual aspirations are welcome. A temple of Lord Dattatraya is the main attraction and adjacent to which is the sanctum sanctorum - Samadhi Mandir where the holy ashes of Maharaj have been preserved and a beautiful marble Shivalinga has been placed on it. The room where Maharaj lived is the most sanctified place where mere visiting alienates one from worldly obsessions. The ashram has a book library as well as book store. There is a separate prayer hall where daily \\"prayers and aarti\\" are offered. The natural surroundings of a lake and a stream add to the overall atmosphere to make it a perfect destination for a dnyana seeker. The day at Shanti Kuteer starts at 5 o'clock in the morning with dawn prayers, followed by dhyan for 30 minutes. At 8.30 am, the disciples perform the puja at the Samadhi Mandir of S S Maharaj. At 12 noon, chapters from Srimad Dasbodh are read and afternoon prayers and aarti are offered. This is followed by lunch. In the evening at 5.30 pm, chapters from Sulabh Atmadnyan are read and evening prayers and aarti are offered. At 8.30 pm, chapters from Srimad Dasbodh are read and night prayers and aarti are offered, followed by dinner. Events and saptah Various saptahs (spiritual fests) are held at Shanti Kuteer Kannur in a calendar year. * Chaitra Saptah (from Chaitra Shuddha Pratipada - Gudi padwa to Ramnavami) was started in 1974 and is for nine days. * Shravan - Ganesh Chaturthi Saptah (celebrated from Shravan Vadya Trayodashi to Ganesh Chaturthi) is celebrated at Shanti Kuteer for the past 34 years. * Datta Jayanti (from Margashirshya Shuddha Trayodashi till Datta Jayanti) was started after the Shri Dattatraya temple was constructed at Shanti Kuteer in 1984 and is for three days.

Before the Meiji Restoration, his courtesy titles were title of Sado no Kami and junior 5th, lower grade court rank (ju go i no ge Âæì‰∫î‰Ωç‰∏ã). Biography Nagakuni was the eldest son of Matsudaira Mitsutsune, the daimyo of Matsumoto Domain in Shinano province. In October 1840, when the 4th daimyo of Karatsu, Ogasawara Nagayoshi died without heirs, the Tokugawa Bakufu selected him as his replacement, and he was posthumously adopted as Nagayoshi‚Äôs son. Nagakuni found his new domain in dire financial straits, and made efforts to avoid bankruptcy through establishment of domain monopolies on whaling and charcoaling. However, Nagakuni was the fourth adopted daimyo in a row in Karatsu domain from the time of Ogasawara Nagamasa, and quickly found his efforts hampered by Ogasawara Nagamichi, a younger son of the first lord who had been bypassed in the succession, but who wielded considerable behind-the-scenes political influence. The domain's government was divided into factions, and Nagakuni, as both an outsider and newcomer had a much weaker position than Nagamichi. Nagakuni attempted to heal the rift by adopting Nagamichi as his heir, but this had the result of all power devolving to Nagamichi, leaving Nagakuni as little more than a figurehead. In 1868, with the start of the Boshin War, Karatsu domain remained strongly in support of the Tokugawa Bakufu. In the Bakumatsu period, Nagayuki served as a R≈çj≈´ in the government, and Karatsu domain itself was a Fudai domain, unlike the neighboring Nabashima domains, which were of Tozama domain status. The Ogasawara remained loyal to the Tokugawa to the end, with many samurai accompanying the remnants of the Tokugawa army north to join the Republic of Ezo and fighting in the Battle of Hakodate. In June 1869, the title of daimy≈ç was abolished, and Nagakuni was appointed governor of Karatsu domain. However, in 1871, Karatsu domain itself was abolished with the abolition of the han system, and became part of the new Saga Prefecture. Nagakuni retired in September 1873, relocated to Tokyo, and died in 1877. References *The content of much of this article was derived from that of the corresponding article on Japanese wikipedia.

Italian Architecture from Michelangelo to Borromini; p. 21. and revised during construction from 1544 by Andrea Palladio. In 1994, the palace was included in the \\"Vicenza, city of Palladio\\" World Heritage Site by UNESCO. In 1996, the World Heritage Site was renamed \\"City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto\\", and it was expanded to include outlying villas (one of which is the Thiene brothers' country home, the Villa Thiene). The palace is used as the historic headquarters of a bank and it also hosts some exhibitions and culture events. The palazzo was the headquarter of Banca Popolare di Vicenza,  History  Floor plan and section by Palladio, from I quattro libri dell'architettura, Venice 1570 The original Gothic palace was committed by Lodovico Thiene to Lorenzo da Bologna in 1490, with an East front made of bricks squared by angular lesenes worked at \\"diamond edge\\", with a portal by Tommaso da Lugano and a triple window (trifora) made in rose marble. In October 1542, Marcantonio and Adriano Thiene began to remodel their 15th century (Quattrocento) family palace in a grandiose project, which would have occupied an entire city block of 54 x 62 metres and faced onto Vicenza's principal artery (today's Corso Palladio). The rich, powerful and sophisticated Thiene brothers belonged to that great Italian nobility which could move with ease among Europe's most important courts; they therefore required a domestic stage adequate for the cosmopolitan expectations of their guests who might visit them. At the same time, as exponents of a well-defined, political faction in the city's aristocracy, they desired a princely palace to emphasise their proper role in the city itself, as the sign of their quasi-seigniorial power. When in 1614 the young English architect Inigo Jones visited the palace, he noted down information directly garnered from Vincenzo Scamozzi and Palma il Giovane: \\"this project was made by Giulio Romano and executed by Palladio\\". Most probably, in fact, the original conception of the Palazzo Thiene should be attributed to the mature and expert Giulio Romano (from 1573 at the Mantuan court of the Gonzagas, with whom the Thiene enjoyed the closest rapport) and the young Palladio should be held responsible rather for the executive design and execution of the building, a role which became ever more essential after Giulio's death in 1546. The elements of the palace, which are attributable to Giulio and alien to Palladio's vocabulary, are clearly recognisable: the four- column atrium is substantially identical with that of the Palazzo Te (even if Palladio indubitably modified its vaulting system); also Giulian are the windows and the ground storey facades onto the street and courtyard, while Palladio must have been defined the upper storey trabeation and capitals. Works began on the building in 1542. In December of the same year, Giulio Romano visited Vicenza for two weeks as a consultant on the loggias for the Basilica. Probably on this occasion he supplied the outline project for the Palazzo Thiene. But works proceeded slowly: on the external facade is inscribed the date 1556, and in the courtyard 1558. In 1552, Adriano Thiene died in France and thereafter, when Marcantonio's son Giulio became marchese of Scandiano, family interests gradually shifted to Ferrara. As a result, only a small portion of the grandiose project was ever realised, but probably neither the Venetians nor the other Vicentine nobles would have accepted such a grandiose private enclave in the centre of their city.

Career  Boris Shpitalny graduated from MAMI Moscow State Technical University in 1927. Three years later, Boris Shpitalny together with Irinarkh Komaritsky designed the ShKAS machine gun, a 7.62 mm machine gun widely used by Soviet aircraft in the 1930s and during World War II. In 1939, a small number of Ultra-ShKAS were produced featuring a firing rate of 3,000 rounds per minute, but these saw only limited use due to reliability problems. ShKAS served as the basis for the ShVAK cannon in 1936 (designed in collaboration with Semyon Vladimirov). This 20-mm autocannon was installed in many Soviet aircraft including Yakovlev Yak-1, Polikarpov I-153 and I-16, Lavochkin La-5 and La-7, LaGG-3, early Ilyushin Il-2, and Soviet- modified Hawker Hurricane aircraft, as well as T-38 and T-60 tanks. His 37 mm autocannon, the Sh-37, was less successful though, and saw only brief service between 1941 and 1942. In 1934-1953, Boris Shpitalny was the head and chief designer of the special design bureau number 15 (–æ—Å–æ–±–æ–µ –ö–ë 15) and then a professor at the Moscow Institute of Geodesy, Aerial Photography & Mapmaking. For his development of new types of aircraft guns, he was awarded the title Hero of Socialist Labour in 1940, two USSR State Prizes in 1941 and 1942, and various medals.

On February 21, 2015, Nevaeh won the WSU Spirit Championship by defeating Niya Barela. On September 27, 2013, Nevaeh made her debut for Shine Wrestling, where she defeated Leva Bates in a singles match. Following the match, Nevaeh was assisted by the S-N-S Express (Jessie Belle and Sassy Stephie) in attacking Bates. She continued to feud with Bates over the next few shows, including a loss in a hardcore match at Shine 15, before defeating her at Shine 16 to end the storyline. At Shine 21, she won a four-way match against Amazing Kong, Su Yung, and Leah Von Dutch. Neveah later formed a new alliance, known as Valifornia, with SoCal Val, Marti Belle, and Jayme Jameson. At Shine 23 in December 2014, she challenged Mia Yim for the Shine Championship but lost by disqualification.  Women of Wrestling (2019‚Äìpresent)  On the September 7 episode of Women of Wrestling (WOW), during the main event between The Beast, Jessicka Havok and Jungle Grrrl in a three-way elimination match to determine the #1 contender for the WOW World Championship, Nevaeh made her debut under the name Hazard by interfering the match in favor of Havok, establishing themselves as a villainous team in the process. The team competed in the WOW World Tag Team Championship tournament and made it through the finales where they lost to Adrenaline and Fire.  Impact Wrestling  = Alliance with Havok (2020‚Äìpresent) = On April 28, 2020, during the second night of Rebellion, Nevaeh made her Impact Wrestling debut as she watched from distance a Full Metal Mayhem match between Havok and Rosemary, which was won by Rosemary. On the May 26 episode of Impact!, Nevaeh interfered a match between Havok and Kimber Lee, as Nevaeh stopped Lee from hitting Havok with a brass knuckles. Havok and Nevaeh continued to attack Lee afterwards, establishing themselves as a team. On June 16 episode of Impact!, Neaveh was victorious in her first match in Impact Wrestling when she defeated Lee. Havok and Nevaeh found themselves feuding with Kiera Hogan and Tasha Steelz, which led into a no disqualification match on the August 11 episode of Impact!, where Hogan and Steelz were victorious, and so ending their feud in the process. Personal life In 2013, she married fellow professional wrestler Jake Crist. The couple were childhood sweethearts while attending Tecumseh High School and have a daughter, Brooklynn, who was born when both were teenagers. Nevaeh had her second daughter, Johnnie, on November 23, 2015.

As well as facilitating acquisition of vocabulary, it is believed to increase motivation through positive affective benefits. It is believed that extensive reading is an important factor in education. Proponents such as Stephen Krashen (1989) claim that reading alone will increase encounters with unknown words, bringing learning opportunities by inferencing. The learner's encounters with unknown words in specific contexts will allow the learner to infer and thus learn those words' meanings. While the mechanism is commonly accepted as true, its importance in language learning is disputed (). About half of all children in rural Laos speak a minority ethnic language at home, and have difficulty in school, which is taught only in the Lao language. This primary school in Laos began a daily reading period in September 2013, in which children select a book to read simply for enjoyment. Big Brother Mouse, a literacy project that sponsored the program, began conducting a study in 2013 to measure reading and vocabulary improvements in schools that had this program. In language learning, extensive reading is contrasted with intensive reading, which is slow, careful reading of a small amount of difficult text ‚Äì it is when one is \\"focused on the language rather than the text\\".Extensive Reading FAQ, Rob Waring Extensive and intensive reading are two approaches to language learning and instruction, and may be used concurrently; intensive reading is, however, the more common approach, and often the only one used. Extensive reading has been used and advocated in language learning since at least the 19th century (with Latin; see below). In the first language, many connections have been made between reading and vocabulary size, as well as other academic skills.  Concepts  Free voluntary reading refers to using extensive reading in language education. Students are free to choose a book that they like and are allowed to read it at their own pace. The aim of a free voluntary reading program is to help students to enjoy reading, so assessment is usually minimized or eliminated entirely. The idea behind extensive reading is that a lot of reading of interesting material that is slightly below, at, or barely above the full comprehension level of the reader will foster improved language skills. Graded readers are often used. For foreign-language learners, some researchers have found that the use of glosses for \\"difficult\\" words is advantageous to vocabulary acquisition () but at least one study finds it has no effect (). A number of studies report significant incidental vocabulary gain in extensive reading in a foreign language (). Advocates claim it can enhance skill in speaking as well as in reading. gave a number of traits common or basic to the extensive reading approach. Students read as much as possible. Reading materials are well within the reader's grammatical and vocabulary competence. The material should be varied in subject matter and character. Students choose their own reading material and are not compelled to finish uninteresting materials. Reading material is normally for pleasure, information, or general understanding; reading is its own reward with few or no follow-up exercises after reading; reading is individual and silent. Reading speed is usually faster when students read materials they can easily understand. Nation(2005) suggests that learning from extensive reading should meet the following conditions: focusing on the meaning of the English text, understanding the type of learning that can occur through such reading, having interesting and engaging books, getting learners to do large quantities of reading at an appropriate level, and making sure that learning from reading is supported by other kinds of learning. In order to meet the conditions needed for learning from extensive reading at the students‚Äô proficiency levels, it is essential to make use of simplified texts (Nation, 2005).Nation, K. (2005). Children‚Äôs reading comprehension difficulties. In M. J. Snowling and C. Hulme (Eds.), The Science of Reading: A Handbook (pp 248‚Äì265).http://eteachershub.com/2015/05/07/developing-china-students-english- reading-ability-through-extensive-reading/ The teacher is a role model who also orients the students to the goals of the program, explains the idea and methodology, keeps records of what has been read, and guides students in material selection and maximizing the effect of the program. Some recent practitioners have not followed all of these traits, or have added to them, for example, requiring regular follow-up exercises such as story summaries or discussions and the use of audio materials in tandem with the readings ().  Graded reader series  A graded reader series is a series of books that increase in difficulty from shorter texts using more common words in the first volumes, to longer texts with less common vocabulary in later volumes. cites Oxford's Bookworm series, which includes the 2,500 most frequent words, The Longman Bridge Series (1945), with a systematic grading up to 8,000 words, now out of print, and the Penguin/Longman Active Reading series with its 3,000 word-family target. Many series of graded readers exist in English, and series exist also in French, German, Italian, and Spanish. , readers are notably absent or scarce in Russian, Arabic, Japanese, and Mandarin Chinese, though since 2006, an extensive reader series is available in Japanese.What is Extensive Reading? Êó•Êú¨Ë™ûÂ§öË™≠Á†îÁ©∂‰ºö (Japanese Extensive Reading Research Society) Ê¥ªÂãïÂ†±Âëä (Report on Activities) 2006 English readers have primarily been produced by British publishers, rather than American or other Anglophone nations. , only one small series (15 volumes) was published in the United States, and a few in Europe outside the UK, with the majority in the UK.  Translation of modern literature  For advocates of extensive reading, lack of reading selection is an acute issue in classical languages such as Latin ‚Äì the main readings available being quite difficult and perceived as dry. To increase the available literature and make more light selection available, modern literature (particularly children's literature, comics, and genre fiction) may be translated into classical languages ‚Äì see list of Latin translations of modern literature for examples in Latin. As F. W. Newman writes in his introduction to a Latin translation of Robinson Crusoe: :\\"[N]o accuracy of reading small portions of Latin will ever be so effective as extensive reading; and to make extensive reading possible to the many, the style ought to be very easy and the matter attractive.\\"Francis William Newman, Rebilius Cruso: Robinson Crusoe, in Latin; A Book to Lighten Tedium to a Learner, London, Tr√ºbner & Co., 1884.  Threshold  Laufer suggests that 3,000 word families or 5,000 lexical items are a threshold () beyond which learners will be able to read more efficiently. Coady & Nation (1998) suggest 98% of lexical coverage and 5,000 word families or 8,000 items for a pleasurable reading experience (). After this threshold, the learner leaves the beginner paradox, and enters a virtuous circle (). Then, extensive reading becomes more efficient.  Limits  , , and offer contrasting perspectives. All agree on the need of lexical input, but Cobb (2007; 2008) supported by denounces the sufficiency of extensive reading, the current lexical expansion pedagogy, especially for confirmed learners. According to Cobb (2007), 's Input Hypothesis states that extensive reading generates a continuous hidden learning (lexical input), eventually \\"doing the entire job\\" of vocabulary acquisition. This hypothesis is without empirical evidence, neither on the extent (% of global vocabulary acquisition), nor on the sufficiency of extensive reading for lexicon learning (Cobb 2007). Cobb (2007) thus proposed a computer-based study to quantitatively assess the efficiency of extensive reading. Cobb estimated the reading quantity of common learners within the second language (~175,000 words over two years), then randomly took 10 words in each of the first thousand most frequent words, the second thousand, and the third thousand, to see how many times those words would appear. Those results should be higher than 6 to 10 encounters, the number needed for stable initial word learning to occur. Cobb (2007) summarizes as follows: \\"[the quantitative study] shows the extreme unlikelihood of developing an adequate L2 reading lexicon [above 2,000 words families] through reading alone, even in highly favorable circumstances\\" since \\"for the vast majority of L2 learners, free or wide reading alone is not a sufficient source of vocabulary knowledge for reading\\". Thereafter, Cobb restated the need for lexical input, and stated the possibility of increasing it using computer technology. McQuillan & Krashen (2008) answer that learners may read far more than 175,000 words but rather +1,000,000 words in 2 years, but counters that view as being based on excessively successful cases of reading oversimplified texts. Experiments cited by McQuillan and Krashen use easy and fast to read texts, but not material suitable for discovering new vocabulary; unsimplified texts are far harder and slower to read.  Advocacy and support organizations  The Extensive Reading Foundation is a not-for-profit, charitable organization whose purpose is to support and promote extensive reading. One of its initiatives is the annual Language Learner Literature Award for the best new works in English. Another is maintaining a bibliography of research on extensive reading. The Foundation is also interested in helping educational institutions set up extensive reading programs through grants that fund the purchase of books and other reading material.http://erfoundation.org/wordpress/ The Extensive Reading Special Interest Group (ER SIG) of the Japan Association for Language Teaching Japan Association for Language Teaching (JALT) is a not-for-profit organization which exists to help promote Extensive Reading in Japan. Via a website, the publications Extensive Reading in Japan and Journal of Extensive Reading, presentations throughout Japan, and other activities, the ER SIG aims to help teachers set up and make the most of their ER programs and ER research projects.  Extensive listening  Similar to extensive reading is extensive listening, which is the analogous approach to listening.Starting Extensive Listening, Rob WaringThe primacy of extensive listening, Meredith Stephens, One issue is that listening speed is generally slower than reading speed, so simpler texts are recommended ‚Äì one may be able to read a text extensively, but not be able to listen to it extensively.

It was opened in May 1897, shortly before the line was opened to Woodville in December of that year. The station is from Pahiatua, in contrast to the original plans for the railway line to run through the town. As Pahiatua is one of the more significant towns in the northern Wairarapa, the station was for many years one of the few staffed stations on the northern section of the line. Though passenger traffic ceased in 1988, the station continues to be the source of freight traffic thanks to the neighbouring dairy factory, and it is also the home of the Pahiatua Railcar Society.  History   Operation  = Heyday: 1897‚Äì1908 = When the station opened, Pahiatua was served by mixed trains that had were extended as the railway made its way north. These trains provided the only passenger services to Pahiatua for the few months it took to complete the line through to Woodville. At the time the Wairarapa Line was completed, the Wellington ‚Äì Longburn line was owned and operated by the private Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company, meaning all government trains from Wellington ran via the Wairarapa, giving a status of some importance to stations like Pahiatua. The popular Napier Mail was diverted from its original Napier ‚Äì Palmerston North route to run via the Wairarapa to Wellington, and became the main passenger service stopping at Pahiatua, supplementing the mixed trains that continued to run. This situation continued until 1908, after when the Wairarapa Line reverted to secondary line status. = Halcyon years: 1908‚Äì1988 = Pahiatua railway station Railcar Storage Shed and Workshop. This building was constructed by the Pahiatua Railcar Society and was completed in 2001. The Wellington and Manawatu Railway was purchased by the government in 1908, which had an effect on services provided in the Wairarapa, particularly the section of the line north of Masterton. Because of the lengthy and costly delays associated with the operation of the Rimutaka Incline, much freight traffic from the northern Wairarapa region was diverted north through Woodville and Palmerston North to the Main Trunk Line to Wellington. Mixed trains, however, continued to operate through Pahiatua. Shortly after the nationalisation of the WMR line, the Napier Express was diverted from the Wairarapa Line to run through the Manawatu Gorge and down the former WMR line to Wellington. Thereafter, the main passenger service to stop at Pahiatua was its replacement, the Wairarapa Mail. A new passenger service was provided from 1936 with the introduction of the Wairarapa-class railcars, which supplemented and later replaced the Wairarapa Mail in 1948. The Wairarapa railcars were replaced after the opening of the Rimutaka Tunnel in 1955 by 88-seater twinset railcars, which provided the main passenger service for Pahiatua for the next 22 years. The 1959 railcar timetable shows two north-bound and two south-bound railcar services stopping daily, with a third service on Fridays. During the railcar period, locomotive-hauled carriage trains were occasionally provided when demand exceeded the capacity of the railcars, and replaced railcar services altogether in 1977. After the railcar services were withdrawn, patronage of passenger services on the northern section of the Wairarapa Line gradually declined. Demand finally reached a point where the service was no longer economical, and the Palmerston North ‚Äì Masterton ‚Äì Wellington and return service was withdrawn from 1 August 1988. This move led to the closure of Pahiatua station to passengers, though it remained open for goods traffic.  Facilities  = Original station: 1897 = The Engineer-in-Chief of the Public Works Department reported in his annual statement of 31 March 1896 that the formation of the Wairarapa Line between Newman and Woodville was nearly complete. A little more than a year later, on 3 May 1897, Pahiatua station was opened (it is not recorded whether any special ceremony or celebration was held to mark the occasion) with the Newman ‚Äì Pahiatua section. Pahiatua was not long the terminus, as the section from Pahiatua to Mangatainoka opened on 2 August, and to Woodville on 11 December. Pahiatua railway station goods shed and loading bank. This is the only surviving original building on site, and was completed in 1897. The original station building was the standard (\\"Special\\") Class 2 design using wood and corrugated iron as building materials, as was common for stations serving towns similar to Pahiatua at the time. Facilities included a station building, platform, \\"cart-road to passenger platform\\", a goods shed, a loading bank, a crane, and cattle yards. The station building contained a ticket office and counter, a waiting room, a station master's office, general staff office and amenities, and public amenities. A stationmaster's house was also provided. A platform veranda was constructed in September 1900, and telegraph facilities were added in 1912. The station was for many years without an adequate water supply, prompting the stationmaster to report on 10 February 1949 that there was nothing to fight fires with and to request that the locomotive water vats be modified so they could be used by the fire brigade if necessary. The public amenities were also considered to be inadequate, but it was not until the station was replaced that modern ablution facilities were provided. Alterations were made to the station building as changing requirements necessitated them. However, insufficient attention seems to have been paid to routine maintenance, and action was often taken in response to complaints from the public. In 1957 a remodelling plan was proposed, which was expected to remedy all of the major maintenance issues at a cost of ¬£2530. It was not until 1963 that money was set aside for the renovations in the working estimates, by which time the District Engineer was in favour of replacing the building. The old station building was painted, and it was planned to set aside money for the new building in the 1967 working estimates. = Replacement station: 1971 = Pahiatua's replacement station building, opened in 1971. The new railway station was completed by Railways staff at a cost of $20,000 in 1971. The building, on concrete foundations, had weatherboard cladding and an aluminium roof, and contained a general office, stationmaster's office, a waiting room, booking office, and public amenities in of space. The platform and yard fences were replaced as part of the project. It was expected that a new goods shed and loading shelter would be added in the future. The signals and communications equipment was housed in a separate building. This was one of the last wooden station buildings of its type erected by the Railways Department before it switched to more modern materials. Arrangements were made in January and February for the official opening ceremony, for which the dates of 10 March and 17 March were initially proposed. The Ways and Works Branch were requested to have the old station building removed and the site tidied up prior to this time. The date of the ceremony was later moved to 31 March, and members of the public were invited to attend. Pahiatua railway station Rolling Stock Storage Shelter. This building was moved to the station precinct in June 2002. Prime Minister Sir Keith Holyoake officially opened the station, with around 100 guests and members of the public in attendance. Special guests included Colonel W. R. Burge, son of Pahiatua's first stationmaster; past station masters, including J. Weston; W. W. Day, chairman of the Pahiatua County Council; T. M. Small, Deputy General Manager of the Railways; and the mayor, J. L. Terry. A bronze plaque had been ordered to mark the occasion, which was unveiled by the Prime Minister, and read: After the ceremony, the official party and invited guests repaired to the Club Hotel for afternoon tea. Wagons waiting to be collected from the Fonterra dairy factory siding, just north of Pahiatua railway station.  Today  Pahiatua is the only operational station between Masterton and Woodville. As well as being the base of operations for the Pahiatua Railcar Society and the premises from which they operate their railway museum, it is used as required to marshal freight trains when wagons are collected from the neighbouring dairy factory. The station is owned by KiwiRail, with the Pahiatua Railcar Society being a lessee. Several facilities have been retained or added at the site, both original and more modern. The 1971 station building remains, as does the original goods shed. The railcar society has erected its own buildings to support its various functions, including a Railcar Storage Shed and Workshop (2001), and a Rolling Stock Storage Shelter (June 2002).Pahiatua Railcar Centre pamphlet As well as the mainline, there are two loops and several sidings serving the railcar shed, goods shed and rolling stock storage shelter. For seven years from 27 November 1988, the northern section of the Wairarapa Line was effectively mothballed, with no trains scheduled through Pahiatua. Congestion on the Wellington ‚Äì Palmerston North section of the NIMT led to the rescheduling of the Wellington ‚Äì Napier freight services to run via the Wairarapa from 14 August 1995. Following the daylighting of Tunnels 3, 4, 5 on the Palmerston North - Gisborne Line in the third quarter of 2008, and thus the removal of the impediment to running hi-cube containers through the Manawatu Gorge, the Wellington ‚Äì Napier freight services were diverted to their original route from late 2008. With the completion of an upgrade at Fonterra's Mangamutu Dairy Factory, including the installation of a new milk powder drier and railway siding, trains will no longer be required to transport milk from Pahiatua to Fonterra's Hawera facility for further processing. However, trains will still be used to transport the processed dairy product.

In his keynote address at Proto.in Delhi in 2008, Kiran Karnik then Chairman of Nasscom referred to Proto.in as the Nasscom for product start-ups in the country. Proto.in has also played an active role in mentoring other start-up support organizations like Bar Camp and Open Coffee Club. http://www.livemint.com/Articles/PopUp.aspx?id=675b90da-5732-11dd-b66b-000b5dabf613 Criticism In the past Proto.in has received criticism for backing only hi- tech product start-ups with a big focus only on web and social media. This perception has changed substantially over its last 3 editions with a deeper focus, they now have a more transparent nomination process. Over the last few editions the focus has also shifted to start-ups in categories like social enterprises, with a strong focus on technology enabled social enterprises. There has also been criticism in terms of the Rs.10,000 nomination fee. Start- ups have found that it is a high price to pay, they also believe that there is a conflict when a start-up is first selected and then made to make a payment. Proto.in's defence has always been the same - they would like to have a start- up to have skin in the game and take the event seriously. Unlike other events, Proto.in is the only one where start-ups are provided free boarding, lodging and a stall. In Proto.in's opinion, the actual cost it incurs per start-up is Rs.50,000.

History The progressive Governor of the Province of Buenos Aires, Mart√≠n Rodr√≠guez proposed a meeting to study the feasibility of a provincial bank for the purpose of stabilizing the local economy wrecked by the Argentine War of Independence and the ensuing chaos. Presided by his Economy Minister, Manuel Gilbert Arnes Angel Enrique Jos√© Garc√≠a, the meeting was convened on January 15, 1822, and resulted in the creation of the Banco de Buenos Ayres. The new institution became popularly known as the Banco de Descuentos (\\"Discount Bank\\") for its role as a source of credit to the myriad community banks in the mainly rural province of the time.Normativa del 8/01/1826 y del 9/1/1826 del Banco de Descuentos. Becoming the first incorporation in Argentine history, its shareholders included local landowners, professionals, clergy, military and government officials, as well as British, French, German and Spanish nationals. Following the advent of Constitutional rule, the bank was reorganized in 1826 as the \\"Bank of the United Provinces of the R√≠o de la Plata\\" (as Argentina was known at the time), highlighting the new role of the institution as a national bank when the federal government acquired a stake. The first National Mint was subsequently opened there as an annex.Texto del Reglamento del Banco Nacional The rise of Federalist Juan Manuel de Rosas as Governor of Buenos Aires in 1829 put the bank at odds with the strongman's agenda, however, and it was rechartered as a provincial mint in 1836. Its hitherto central role in national finances was reduced to a retail bank branch on site. Following Rosas' 1852 overthrow, the institution was formally restored as a private incorporated bank in 1854 and in 1863, it was formally designated the Bank of the Province of Buenos Aires, while retaining its ancillary function as a national and provincial mint. Headquarters in La Plata The 1882 establishment of the new provincial capital of La Plata led to the construction of a new headquarters. The bank's headquarters, located in La Plata, were inaugurated in 1886 and designed in a Renaissance Revival style by Juan Antonio Buschiazzo and Luis Viglione. Its main offices, however, are in the Buenos Aires financial district, and are located in a Rationalist building completed in 1942 and designed by Gregorio S√°nchez, Ernesto Lagos, and Luis de la Torre. The federal government regained a stake in the bank in 1906, amid a socio-economic boom. Following a number of international crises, however, President Juan Per√≥n nationalized the bank in 1946, as part of his program of wholesale nationalizations of strategically important companies, and appointed Dr. Arturo Jauretche director. Jauretche reoriented the bank's lending policy away from its largely agrarian portfolio, and towards import substitution industrialization; following his death in 1974, the bank's Historical Museum was renamed in honor of the nationalist intellectual.Arturo Jauretche Growing alongside the Argentine economy, the bank played an important role as a lifeline to employers and local governments during the 1980s, after the last dictatorship's economic policies saddled the economy with a lasting foreign debt crisis and malaise.Argentina: From Insolvency to Growth. The World Bank, 1993. Two of its former directors, Aldo Ferrer and Mart√≠n Lousteau, have also served as the nation's Ministers of the Economy. The bank today operates 342 branches and is Argentina's second- largest by deposits (holding US$10 billion, or, 8% of the total) and total assets, and the sixth-largest in lending with a US$5 billion loan portfolio (a 6% share).

Originally from Morocco, he emigrated to Spain and gained citizenship in August 2008. He has represented Spain at the 2008 and 2012 Summer Paralympics, winning silver in the 1,500 meters and bronze in the 800 meters in 2008, and silver in the marathon in 2012.  Personal  Ait Khamouch was born on November 9, 1986. He was born in Morocco. He is the second youngest child in his family. He has an arm amputation, as a result of a fall when he was a child that led to medical complications that later resulted in him getting gangrene. The doctors were left with little choice but to amputate his right arm almost at his shoulder. As a minor, when Ait Khamouch was 15 years old, he tried to enter Spain illegally three times via boats from Laayoune to the Canary Islands. During these trips, he saw people die. He eventually got a boat to Fuerteventura and successfully entered Spain in 2001. From there, he traveled to Madrid and then on to Barcelona with friends via the train. When Ait Khamouch first got work in Barcelona, he worked as an attendant at a parking lot because he spoke French. He got Spanish citizenship on August 25, 2008. Ait Khamouch wrote an autobiography in Arabic titled \\"The Angel with the Crooked Wing.\\" It was translated into Spanish. He speaks Spanish, French and Arabic. In 2013, he was awarded the silver Real Orden al M√©rito Deportivo.  Athletics  Ait Khamouch is a Paralympic athlete competing mainly in category T46 middle distance and marathon events. His first athletics race was one organized by French tourists in his hometown in Morocco. He won the race, and the prize of a small blue truck. Following the race, he approached the Morocco Paralympic Committee about competing in athletics, but they rejected him citing a variety of factors. Following his arrival in Spain, he eventually took part in a race in Barcelona organized by El Corte Ingl√©s in 2003 where his performance attracted attention and eventually coaching. He then competed in other races in the area. The Athletics Federation of Catalonia and others assisted in getting Ait Khamouch Spanish citizenship in time for him to represent Spain at the 2008 Summer Paralympics. The first athletics club Ait Khamouch belonged to in Spain was the Athletic Club Nou Barris. In 2004, he participated the Spanish Paralympic national championships where he won a gold medal in the 800 meters. In 2005, he received a scholarship from the Spanish Paralympic Committee. In 2008, he trained at the Center for High Performance San Cugat (Barcelona). He qualified for and competed in the 2011 IPC Athletics World Championships where he was one of thirty-two competitors representing Spain. In 2012, he was a recipient of a Plan ADO ‚Ç¨2,500 coaching scholarship.

Schommer (December 9, 1946 ‚Äì December 12, 2001) was an American observational astronomer. He was a professor at Rutgers University and later a project scientist for the U.S. office of the Gemini Observatory Project at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) in Chile. He was known for his wide range of research interests, from stellar populations to cosmology. Schommer was born in Chicago, Illinois to Harvey and Bea Schommer. He received a B.A. in Physics from the University of Chicago in 1970 and a Ph.D. in Astronomy from the University of Washington in 1977, where he continued for one year as instructor. Following two years in seminary college in Chicago, he held postdoctoral positions at Caltech (as Chaim Weizmann Fellow), the Hale Observatories, the University of Chicago, and Cambridge University (as NATO Postdoctoral Fellow) before joining the Department of Physics at the State University of New Jersey. He became increasingly unhappy with the department's unwillingness to support astronomy, and in 1990 he moved to CTIO in Chile where he remained until his death in 2001. Research Schommer carried out some of the first charge-coupled device (CCD) imaging studies of Large Magellanic Cloud star clusters, published in a paper on what is now called the \\"short distance\\" to the LMC.Schommer, R. A., Olszewski, E. W., Aaronson, M. (1984), A distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud by main-sequence fitting, Astrophysical Journal Letters, 285, L53-L57. His work on star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds and the galaxy M33 were fundamental in providing a basis for our understanding of the chemical histories of those galaxies. Schommer was an active member of the High-z Supernova Search Team and co-authored their 1998 paper arguing that we live in an accelerating universe with a cosmological constant.Riess et al.

It was only in use in 1885 and 1886. History The construction of Port Grosvenor was initiated by Captain Sidney Turner, who in 1867, with his father-in-law Walter Compton, had bought of undeveloped Crown Land on the Natal South Coast between Umkomaas and the present village of Clansthal. Turner had launched the first salvage attempt of the Grosvenor as reported on 20 May 1880 by the paper Natal Mercury. Turner and a friend, Lieut Beddoes, of the Durban Volunteer Artillery, had set off for Port St Johns in the vessel Adonis, had proceeded to the wreck and commenced blasting the rocks with dynamite. By the beginning of 1885 a local chief Mqikela, who had grown disaffected with the British government and wanted to develop his own harbour, concluded an agreement with Turner, in which Turner was granted 20,000 acres of land, including the coastline on which the Grosvenor had foundered. In return for this Turner was to select a suitable site for a harbour and undertake the necessary construction work. The site chosen for this new venture was at the mouth of the Mkweni River, close to the site of the Grosvenor wreck. Turner named it Port Grosvenor. As port captain and harbourmaster, Turner collected customs dues and managed the harbour and pilotage. Turner was obliged by his financial circumstances to resign himself to this situation as he, by 1884, had a family of seven children and a wife to support. Despite objections from the Cape Government the port was officially opened. The Cape Government, despite having no jurisdiction in the area, later declared Turner's concession illegal under tribal law, and he forfeited the land, his home and his position. The family moved to Port St Johns and Port Grosvenor faded into obscurity, the last ship calling there in January 1886 being the coaster SS Somtseu, named for Theophilus Shepstone.Shipwrecks on the Wild CoastPortrait of a Pioneer - Daphne Child, 1980 Macmillan SA The Somtseu (#77075 1878-1897)) had been built in London in 1878 and specially designed to cope with the shallow harbours of the Natal coastline; it had also been the first boat to call in 1880 at the newly deepened South Shepstone harbour, later to be named Port Shepstone.

Most especially, spinmechatronics (or spin mechatronics) concerns the integration of micro- and nano- mechatronic systems with spin physics and spintronics. History and origins While spinmechatronics has been recognised only recently http://www.spinmechatronics.org (2008) as an independent field, hybrid spin-mechanical system development dates back to the early nineteen-nineties, with devices combining spintronics and micromechanics emerging at the turn of the twenty-first century. One of the longest established spinmechatronic systems is the Magnetic Resonance Force Microscope or MRFM. First proposed by J. A. Sidles in a seminal paper of 1991 ‚Äì and since extensively developed both theoretically and experimentally by a number of international research groups ‚Äì the MRFM operates by coupling a magnetically loaded micro-mechanical cantilever to an excited nuclear, proton or electron spin system. The MRFM concept effectively combines scanning atomic force microscopy (AFM) with magnetic resonance spectroscopy to provide a spectroscopic tool of unparalleled sensitivity. Nanometre resolution is possible, and the technique potentially forms the basis for ultra-high sensitivity, ultra-high resolution magnetic, biochemical, biomedical, and clinical diagnostics. The synergy of micromechanics and established spintronic technologies for sensing applications is one of the most significant spinmechatronic developments of the last decade. At the beginning of this century, strain sensors incorporating magnetoresistive technologies emerged and a wide range of devices exploiting similar principles are likely to realize research and commercial potential by 2015. Contemporary innovation in spinmechatronics drives forward the independent advancement of cutting-edge science in spin physics, spintronics and micro- and nano-mechatronics and catalyses the development of wholly new instrumentation, control and fabrication techniques to facilitate and exploit their integration. Key constitutive technologies Micro- and nano- mechatronics MEMS: micro- electromechanical systems are the key ingredient of micro-mechatronics. Micro- electromechanical systems are ‚Äì as the name suggests ‚Äì devices with significant dimensions in the micrometre regime or less.http://www.jwnc.gla.ac.uk Highly suited to integration with electronic and microwave circuitry, they provide the key to electro-mechanical functionalities unachievable with classical precision mechatronics. Commercialisation of mass-produced Microelectromechanical systems products is rapidly picking up pace and includes printer ink-jet technology, 3D accelerometers, integrated pressure sensors, and Digital Light Processing (DLP) displays. At the cutting edge of Microelectromechanical systems fabrication and integration technologies are nano- electromechanical systems (NEMS). Typical examples are micrometres long, tens of nanometres thick, and have mechanical resonance frequencies approaching 100 MHz. Their small physical dimensions and mass (of order pico-grams) makes them highly sensitive to changes in stiffness; this, their synergy with mechanical and data processing systems, and the option of attaching chemical/ biological molecules, makes them ideal for ultra high-performance mechanical, chemical and biological sensing applications. Spin physics Spin physics is a broad and active area of condensed-matter physics research. ‚ÄòSpin‚Äô in this context refers to a quantum mechanical property of certain elementary particles and nuclei, and should not be confused with the classical (and better-known) concept of rotation. Spin physics spans studies of nuclear, electron and proton magnetic resonance, magnetism, and certain areas of optics. Spintronics is a branch of spin physics. Perhaps the two best known applications of spin physics are Magnetic Resonance Imaging (or MRI) and the spintronic giant-magnetoresistive (GMR) hard disk read head. Spintronics Spintronic magnetoresistance is a major scientific and commercial success story. Today, most families own a spintronic device: the giant- magnetoresistive (GMR) hard disk read head in their computer. The science that gave rise to this phenomenal business opportunity ‚Äì and earned the 2007 Nobel Prize for Physics ‚Äì was the recognition that electrical carriers are characterized by both charge and spin.http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2007/press.html Today, tunnelling-magnetoresistance (TMR) ‚Äì which uses the electron spin as a label to allow or forbid electron tunnelling ‚Äì dominates the hard disk market and is rapidly establishing itself in areas as diverse as magnetic logic devices and biosensors. Ongoing development is pushing the frontiers of TMR devices towards the nanoscale.

Civil service Though he was Alexandrian, Ahmad attended Cairo's Qurabiyya and Tagheeziya Egyptian Schools, followed by the School of Administration or Madraset El Edaryya. While a student there, he won a competition to become a translator for Ismailia's provincial government at a monthly salary of ¬£E 13; in 1888, thanks to his command of French, he moved to the press bureau of the Interior Ministry. He also became an editor and translator for al-Waqa'i\`al-Masriya, a translation teacher for the Khedivial School, and an Arabic teacher for the French Archaeological Institute in Cairo, all in 1888. In the following year he won a competition for the post of translator for the Cabinet, for which he became adjunct secretary in 1897 and secretary-general in 1911, serving until he retired in 1921. During World War I he also recodified Egypt's administrative procedures in keeping with its status as a British protectorate. Scholarly activities Because of his wide range of interests and numerous publications, he became a fellow of the Institut d'√âgypte, the Royal Geographical Society, and the Royal Asiatic Society in London. He served on the administrative boards of both al-Azhar and the Egyptian University (now named Cairo University), also holding the chair for Islamic civilization in the latter. He took the lead in setting the Classical Arabic-language equivalents of European loanwords, such as sayyara (ÿ≥Ÿäÿßÿ±ÿ©) for \\"automobile,\\" and also alerted the press to the Arabic origins of many Spanish and Portuguese place-names that had been inaccurately transcribed into Arabic. He participated in many conferences of the International Congress of Orientalists and was respected by Europeans for his erudition. Pan-Arabism He was a staunch nationalist Egyptian from his youth, later pan-Arab and even pan-Oriental, becoming one of the founders and first secretary-general of al-Rabita al-Sharqiyya (, the Oriental League or the Eastern league). His Giza home, Bayt al-'Uruba (), became the meeting place for visitors from all Arab countries, mainly the Gulf region, even at times a site for reconciliations between quarreling Arab princes, and a repository of wealthy Arab antique furniture, jewelry, books, and manuscripts. He also erected a mosque near his home, where he is buried. A prodigious writer of articles and short books, he did not live long enough to complete what would have been the crowning achievement of his scholarship, an Arabic dictionary modeled on the French Larousse. He gave his books and manuscripts to the Egyptian National Library - Dar al-Kutub al-Masryia.

Biography Born into a musical family (Wendler's father, Prof. Dr. Anton Wendler, worked as a tenor and assistant director at the Vienna State Opera while his mother had a brief career as an operatic soprano before switching careers to work for the United Nations), Wendler attended the Vienna Choir Boys from 1985 until 1989, participating in four tours around the globe, singing in more than 500 concerts and opera performances, sharing stages with Jos√© Carreras, Agnes Baltsa, and Alfredo Kraus, and working with conductors such as Colin Davis and Horst Stein. After his voice changed, Wendler attended the Theresianische Akademie, from which he graduated with honors, in 1993. Wendler's passion for film music started at around the age of 10, and by the time he graduated from high school, his collection of soundtrack CD's exceeded 1500. From 1996 until 1998, Wendler wrote, directed, and scored several award-winning short films for the Austrian independent film company, Magellan-Film. His work was showcased at several independent, local and international film festivals, including the UNICA Festival.Results UNICA 1998 Wendler earned certificates in film scoring and screenwriting from UCLA Extension in 1999. His first concert commission arrived that same year from the University of Ottawa and its choral director, Laurence Ewashko. The resulting piece, Consolatio, for choir and symphony orchestra, received a standing ovation at its premiere at St. Joseph's Church, Ottawa, and was subsequently broadcast on local Canadian television stations. In 2004, the piece was performed at Bridgewater Hall, Manchester, by the Stockport Youth Orchestra and five combined choirs from the area. Philip Mackenzie conducted.2004 AGM - Musical Director's Report , music director Philip Mackenzie's report of the concert. After composing music for dozens of short films, Wendler landed his first feature film when writer/director Temi Lopez hired him to score his 2001 movie, Home - The Horror Story, starring Richard Beymer and Grace Zabriskie. In 2003, Wendler scored Jos√©Antonio W. Danner‚Äôs ambitious comedy short film, Wrong Hollywood Number. Collaborators on this project: London Metropolitan Orchestra, legendary recording engineer Mike Ross-Trevor, and Academy Award-nominated scoring mixer Dennis S. Sands. In 2004, Wendler was accepted into the prestigious ASCAP Film Scoring Workshop, which concluded with a recording session at 20th Century Fox‚Äôs Newman Scoring Stage, with famed scoring mixer Armin Steiner and the Hollywood Studio Symphony Orchestra.ASCAP Film Scoring Workshop 2004 Also in 2004, film composer Paul Haslinger asked Wendler to join his team as an arranger, orchestrator, and music programmer, resulting in work on the movies Into the Blue, Turistas, The Fifth Commandment, and Gardener of Eden, as well as the second season of the Showtime series, Sleeper Cell. During this time, Wendler also wrote additional music for the NBC reality series, Fear Factor. In 2007, Wendler was hired to score the internet series, The Interior (soundtrack released by Perseverance Records as an online exclusive album), and in late 2008 / early 2009, he wrote the music for the U.S. version of the film, Broken Angel. In November 2009, artistic director and conductor Christopher McCafferty commissioned a piece for a cappella choir from Edwin Wendler. The Illumni Men's Chorale premiered the resulting Winter Medley at its inaugural concerts on December 19 and 20, 2009, in the Seattle area.IMC Lux Spiritu concerts - press release Illumni commissioned several other pieces from Mr. Wendler during subsequent years. Producer James Chankin hired Edwin Wendler for four stylistically diverse feature film scores: Christmas with a Capital C (2010), The Mark (2012), Escape (2012), and The Mark: Redemption (2013). Perseverance Records released a soundtrack album for Escape to generally positive reviews. In 2010, Mr. Wendler received arranging credit on the comedy feature, Little Fockers, which was scored by composer Stephen Trask. Trask hired Wendler again for the Miley Cyrus-starring comedy, So Undercover. Composer John Ottman credited Edwin Wendler as orchestrator on the 2010 action movie, The Losers, and subsequently as an arranger and MIDI programmer on the thrillers The Resident (starring Hilary Swank and Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and Unknown, as well as on the 2014 summer blockbuster, X-Men: Days of Future Past.

He was a member of various groups including Kevin Borich Express (1978‚Äì79), Mondo Rock (1980‚Äì82) and the Party Boys (1982‚Äì90, 1992, 1998‚Äì99). As a member of Mondo Rock he performed on the tracks, \\"State of the Heart\\", \\"Cool World\\", \\"Summer of '81\\", \\"Chemistry\\", \\"No Time\\", \\"The Queen and Me\\" and \\"In Another Love\\".  Biography  Paul Adrian Christie, was born in 1953 and grew up in Brisbane. By 1976 he was a member of a group, Feet First, followed by Silverwing, Bobby Warren & Co & Loose Booty before joining hard rockers, Kevin Borich Express, in May 1978 in Sydney. He replaced Bob Jackson on bass guitar alongside Kevin Borich on lead guitar and lead vocals and John Annas on drums. The group toured the United States, where they added the American keyboardist, Tim Schafer (ex-Gary Wright Band) and recorded tracks at Cherokee Studios, Los Angeles. While in LA they performed two shows at Starwood Theatre with a set list, \\"'Going Somewhere', 'Celebration', 'KB's Boogie', 'Going Down Town', 'No Turning Back' and 'New City Lights'.\\" This line-up issued a studio album, No Turning Back, in March 1979, with Tom Serfert producing. In the following month Christie and Schafer both left. In April 1980 Christie joined Mondo Rock in Melbourne on bass guitar with James Black (ex-Rum Jungle, Russell Morris Band) on keyboards and guitar; Gil Matthews (ex-Billy Thorpe & the Aztecs) on drums; Eric McCusker (ex-the Captain Matchbox Whoopee Band) on guitar; and Ross Wilson (ex-Daddy Cool) on lead vocals and harmonica. As a member of that group he performed on the albums, Chemistry (July 1981) and Nuovo Mondo (July 1982). The albums provided the singles, \\"State of the Heart\\" (October 1980), \\"Cool World\\" (March 1981), \\"Chemistry\\" (July), \\"Summer of '81\\" (October), \\"No Time\\" (June 1982), \\"The Queen and Me\\" (September) and \\"In Another Love\\" (March 1983). He co-wrote the tracks, \\"Chemistry\\" from the album of that name, and, \\"Domination\\", from Nuovo Mondo (and B-side of \\"The Queen and Me\\"). Note: For additional work user may have to select 'Search again' and then 'Enter a title:' &/or 'Performer:' By September 1982 Christie had left that group. Christie then founded an Australian rock ensemble, the Party Boys, in November 1982 in Sydney. The initial line-up was former bandmate Borich on guitar, Graham \\"Buzz\\" Bidstrup, (ex-the Angels) on drums, Harvey James (ex- Mississippi, Ariel, Sherbet) on guitar and James Reyne (on loan from Australian Crawl) on lead vocals. From his memoirs: 'Upon leaving Mondo Rock in late 1982 I returned to Sydney and took a break on the northern beaches. I thought about options for the future and devised the concept of The Party Boys. Australian Crawl singer James Reyne & I had become friends whilst I was living in Melbourne. We shared a common belief that as musicians, we were not receiving the best financial returns based on the success experienced in our respective bands. This was the way the music business was structured coming out of the ‚Äò70‚Äôs into the early ‚Äò80‚Äôs.\\" \\"I believed a line-up of musicians from a number of known bands performing together for an interim period, managed and coordinated by myself, would succeed, for the benefit of the musicians. In October of 1982 I approached the manager of Moby Dick Surfers Club, Graham Chatfield and proposed two concert dates for Nov 14th & 21st 1982. He accepted and booked the yet unrehearsed band. James was in Sydney filming Return to Eden, he had available time. I called guitarist Ian Moss (Cold Chisel) who was unavailable however his housemate Harvey James (Ariel, Sherbet) was and agreed to participate. I had worked with The Angels fleetingly and become friends with drummer Graham Bidstrup, he joined along with Kevin Borich who had employed me as bass player from 1977-1979 in the Kevin Borich Express.\\" \\"The Nov 14th date was wildly successful, the band then performed at The Astra Hotel Bondi, The National Hotel Brisbane, The Manly Vale Hotel then Moby‚Äôs again on the 21st. A live album Live at Several 21st's was recorded by Keith Walker of 2JJJ at Manly Vale.\\" Released by EMI Records it received gold record certification. The band went through several incarnations over the next decade. Christie was a founding partner of Almost Famous , a corporate team building and events company. He has participated in reformations of Mondo Rock. In 2006 with the line-up of Christie, Black, McCusker and Wilson, they performed on the 2006 Countdown Spectacular concert series playing a medley of \\"Cool World\\" and \\"Summer of '81\\" and a full version of \\"Come Said the Boy\\". In June 2014 they reunited to perform Chemistry live at a series of gigs at Australian state capitals. The line-up was Christie, Black, Mathews, McCusker, and Wilson. They released a compilation album, Besto Mondo, in August 2015.

It has been inhabited since at least the Mesolithic period; was the site of a Roman fort, and much later an early example of a spa town. In more recent times it serves as a residential district within the travel to work areas of Bradford, Leeds and Keighley. According to the probably outdated history of the 19th century clergyman Robert Collyer, Ilkley takes its name from \\"Llecan, the old British word for rock\\",Rev. Robert Collyer, and J. Horsfall Turner, Ilkley: Ancient and Modern, Wm. Walker & Sons, 1885, pp. 17-18 this, presumably, alluding to the craggy prominences of the area such as the Cow and Calf on Ilkley Moor. Prehistory The earliest evidence of habitation in the Ilkley area is flint arrowheads or microliths, dating to the Mesolithic period, from about 11,000 BC onwards.Discovering Prehistory on Ilkley Moor, by John Abraham, on the Timetravel Britain website. The area around Ilkley has been continuously settled since at least the early Bronze Age, around 1800 BC; more than 250 cup and ring marks, and curved a swastika carving dating to the period have been found on rock outcrops,Beckensall, S., 2009, 'Prehistoric Rock Art in Britain, Chalford: Amberley Publishing, and archaeological remains of dwellings are found on Ilkley Moor. A druidical stone circle, the Twelve Apostles Stone Circle, was constructed 2,000 years ago. Serious interest in the rock art of Ilkley began after the publication in 1879, by John Romilly Allen, of \\"The Prehistoric Rock Sculptures of Ilkley\\" in The Journal of the British Archaeological Association. Robert Collyer notes that Ilkley was at the centre of the territory of the Brigantes, and states that it was one of ten strongholds of this tribe. He notes that the town was on a pre-Roman track-way running from the north through Catterick to Chester and Holyhead. Roman period Remains of a Roman wall located to the south of the Manor House, Ilkley In the Roman period, Ilkley lay at a crossroads of Roman roads, connecting to Catterick and Adel; Skipton and Gisburn; Aldborough, Knaresborough and Blubberhouses; and Morton leading to Manchester.Rev. Robert Collyer, and J. Horsfall Turner, Ilkley: Ancient and Modern, Wm. Walker & Sons, 1885, p. 22 The remains of a Roman fort exist on a site now near the centre of the town. A number of authorities believe that the fort is that of Olicana,Thomas Shaw, The History of Wharfedale, Otley, William Walker, 1830, p. 70 dating to 79 AD, but the identification is not settled. The fort's outline is clear: some one hundred and sixty yards by one hundred yards in size, it was placed on a steep bank above the River Wharfe on the north side, and bounded by deep channels of a brook immediately on the east and west. The southern boundary seems to have coincided with the present street. The foundations of the fort on the bank are very conspicuous, and remains of Roman brick, glass, and earthenware have been found on the edges of the brow. An Elizabethan Manor House and the parish church, All Saints, stand within the precincts of the fort.Thomas Shaw, The History of Wharfedale, Otley, William Walker, 1830, p. 71 A number of altars have been discovered dating to Roman times. The oldest, found in the south east corner of the church and now defaced, is according to William Camden's account of a 1570 inspection, from the time of Emperor Antoninus Pius (138 to 161) and named the Prefect of the Cohort\\" then stationed here, as C√¶cilius. A second, retrieved from the Wharfe, is thought to have been dedicated by Clodius Front., the Roman officer, to Verbeia, the goddess-nymph of the stream, for his safety. It states that the cohort were maintained in the garrison, and that they were composed of Frenchmen. Another altar described by Camden dates to the time of Septimius Severus and his son Caracalla (211 to 217) and notes that the fort has been repaired under the superintendence of Virius Lupus, lieutenant and propr√¶tor in Britain; from which we may conclude that the station was then in its fullest glory.Thomas Shaw, The History of Wharfedale, Otley, William Walker, 1830, pp. 72-74 Anglo-Saxon period Collyer notes that there is not one sure word about Ilkley in the 800 years after the improvement of the fort by Virius Lupus; but that by the Norman period the area had an Anglo-Saxon name, derived from the Roman and Old British names; was a parish with church and priest; and contained four centres of life and industry, namely Ilkley, Nessfield, Middleton and Stubham. He conjectures that Ilkley's place on the track and road system of the time would have ensured that it was affected by the waves of invasions of Britain which took place throughout the Dark Ages, with Angles, Saxons and Danes settling and bequeathing names to the locality, whilst at the same time perhaps squeezing out the indigenous and Roman descent population.Rev. Robert Collyer, and J. Horsfall Turner, Ilkley: Ancient and Modern, Wm. Walker & Sons, 1885, pp. 37-38 Ilkley's Anglo-Saxon church is taken by Collyer to date to a 627 consecration, and most probably arising out of preaching by PaulinusRev. Robert Collyer, and J. Horsfall Turner, Ilkley: Ancient and Modern, Wm. Walker & Sons, 1885, p. 38 Three Anglo-Saxon crosses formerly in the churchyard of All Saints, but now removed into the church to prevent erosion, date to the 8th century. Norman period and the Middleton family The Manor House, Ilkley Ilkley formed part of the Wapentake of Skyrack; its lands to the north of the river fell into the wapentake of Claro.Thomas Shaw, The History of Wharfedale, Otley, William Walker, 1830, p. 67 In the Domesday Book, dating to 1086, Ilkley (Ilecliue/Illecliue/Illiclei/Illicleia) is listed as being in the possession of William de Percy 1st Baron Percy.Ilkley a 'Ghost Town' in 1086, edited version of an Ilkley Gazette article from 18 February 1993. By 1242 the land had passed to the Kyme family, of whose number Philip de Kyme appointed the first rector of the parish church on 11 December. The land was acquired by the Middelton family of Myddelton Lodge, from about a century after the time of William the Conqueror. The family lost possession through a series of land sales and mortgage repossessions throughout a period of about a hundred years from the early nineteenth century.Who were the Middletons?, containing excerpts from The Lords of Ilkley Manor - The Road to Ruin: The Middelton Family of Stockeld Park (1763-1947) by David Carpenter. The agents of William Middelton (1815-1885) were responsible for the design of the new town of Ilkley to replace the village which had stood there before.Middelton Mini- Biographies taken from The Lords of Ilkley Manor - The Road to Ruin. Spa town and the railway The Grove, Ilkley's principal shopping street, designed with wide pavements for promenading In the 17th and 18th centuries the town gained a reputation for the efficacy of its water. The Middleton family constructed and for many years maintained White Wells, an early example of a spa building containing dressing rooms and a bath fed from a spring, in the eighteenth century.White Wells Online - History The Middletons encouraged visitors by permitting shooting on the manor and fishing in the river.Thomas Shaw, The History of Wharfedale, Otley, William Walker, 1830, p. 75 Prior to the spa boom, however, Ilkley was \\"a little, old and ragged village\\" of single storey thatched cottages.Calcin Colton, Four Years in Great Britain, 1831-1835, New York, Harper and Brothers, 1835 p. 166 In the 19th century the town became established as a fashionable spa town, with the construction a mile to the east of the town, at Wheatley, of the vast Ben Rhydding Hydro or Hydropathic Establishment between 1843 and 1844. Tourists flocked here to 'take the waters' and bathe in the cold water spring. Wheatley today is called Ben Rhydding after the Hydro (since demolished). Development based on the Hydro movement, and upon the establishment of a number of convalescent homes and hospitals, was accelerated by the establishment of a railway connection from Leeds and Bradford in 1865. Charles Darwin underwent hydropathic treatment at Wells House when his book On the Origin of Species was published on 24 November 1859, staying with his family at the nearby North View House (now Hillside Court). Other Victorian visitors to the town include Madame Tussaud. Today, the only remaining Hydro is the white cottage known as White Wells House, which can be seen and visited on the edge of the moor over- looking the town. 20th century International Wool Secretariat building in Ben Rhydding, Ilkley By and through the 20th century Ilkley become a very wealthy dormitory town for the nearby cities of Leeds and Bradford. During 1906‚Äì08 architect Edwin Lutyens built Heathcote, a particularly large Neoclassical style villa, for John Thomas Hemingway, a Bradford wool merchant.Jane Brown, Lutyens and the Edwardians. London: Viking, 1996, , pp. 133-136 It is a Grade II* listed building. T. S. Eliot in 1916 delivered six extension lectures in Ilkley, on the theme of modern French literature. He considered Wensleydale to be the 'Mozart of cheeses'. Between the 5 and 17 August 1923, philosopher and educator Rudolf Steiner delivered a series of fourteen lectures at Ilkley which were published as A Modern Art of Education. They provided a comprehensive overview of Waldorf education. In his report of the event, which embodies the language of his distinctive philosophical approach, he commented on the town's archaeological heritage: :in the remains of dolmens and old Druidic altars lying around everywhere, [Ilkley] has traces of something that reminds one of the ancient spirituality that has, however, no successors. It is most moving to have on the one hand the impression [of the industrialism] I just described and then, on the other, to climb a hill in this region so filled with the effects of those impressions and then find in those very characteristic places the remains of ancient sacrificial altars marked with appropriate signs.Rudolf Steiner, Rudolf Steiner Speaks to the British: Lectures and Addresses in England and Wales. London: Rudolf Steiner Press, 1998 In 1967 Jimi Hendrix played at the Troutbeck Hotel, now a nursing home, although the show was cut short by the police. The local newspaper headline read \\"Pop Fans Ran Amok in Hotel\\" after audience members allegedly ripped off doors, pulled out electrical fittings and smashed furniture after a police sergeant stepped on stage and stopped Hendrix midway through a number. 1973 saw the start of the annual Ilkley Literature Festival, the largest in Northern England. W. H. Auden gave his last English reading there that same year.

He is known for Citizen Hearst, a biography of William Randolph Hearst, which was recommended by the Pulitzer Prize board in 1962 but overturned by the trustees. He won the 1973 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography for his 1972 biography of Henry Luce, and the National Book Award in 1977 for his 1976 biography of Norman Thomas. Background Swanberg was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota in 1907, and earned his B.A. at the University of Minnesota in 1930.Gale Contemporary Authors Online. Volume 13. With grudging and only partial help from his father, who wanted his son to be a cabinet maker like himself, Swanberg earned his degree. Career Upon graduation, he employment as a journalist with such local daily newspapers as the St. Paul Daily News and the Minneapolis Star unsatisfactory, as their staff were shrinking during the Great Depression. Swanberg instead held a succession of low-paying manual labor jobs. After five years he followed a college friend to New York City in September 1935. After months of anxious job-hunting he secured an interview at the Dell Publishing Company with president George T. Delacorte Jr., and was hired as an assistant editor of three lowbrow magazines. Money saved in the next months enabled him to return briefly to the Midwest to marry his college sweetheart Dorothy Green, and bring her to New York. He soon began to climb the editorial ladder at Dell, and by 1939 he was doing well enough to buy a house in Connecticut. When the United States entered World War II, Swanberg was 34 years old, father of two children, and suffering from a hearing disability. Rejected by the U.S. Army, in 1943 he enlisted in the Office of War Information and, after training, was sent to England following D-Day. In London, amid the V-1 and V-2 attacks, he prepared and edited pamphlets to be air-dropped behind enemy lines in France and later in Norway.Gale, p. 264 With the end of the war he returned in October 1945 to Dell and the publishing world. Swanberg did not return to magazine editing but instead did freelance work within and without Dell. By 1953, he began carving out time for researching his first book (Sickles), which Scribner's purchased, beginning a long-term association. Swanberg's early hopes of newspaper work never materialized, but by the mid-1950s he had established himself as scholarly biographer. His efforts proved to be labor-intensive and required up to four years apiece, even when assisted by the research and transcription efforts of his wife Dorothy. Upon turning 80 in 1987, Swanberg attempted one last biography, about William Eugene ‚ÄúPussyfoot‚Äù Johnson (1862‚Äì1945).Gale, p. 277 He was at work on that project when he succumbed to heart failure at his typewriter in Southbury, Connecticut on September 17, 1992. Rejection for Pulitzer Prize Swanberg's 1961 book Citizen Hearst: A Biography of William Randolph Hearst was recommended for a Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography by the advisory board but rejected by the trustees of Columbia University, apparently because they thought that Hearst was not dignified enough to be the subject of the award. It was the first time in 46 years that the trustees rejected a recommendation from the advisory board, and the news caused sales to soar.

It broadcasts for thirty minutes each Monday to Friday from 18:00, covering regional news stories, features, sport and weather. It is presented by Ian Payne or Pam Royle. Shorter bulletins air at other times (as ITV News Border). Overview The news service is produced and broadcast from studios at The Watermark, Gateshead with reporters also based at offices in Carlisle and Edinburgh. Both regional services (I.e ‚Äò‚ÄôITV News Tyne Tees‚Äô‚Äô and ‚Äò‚ÄôLookaround‚Äô‚Äô) utilise exactly the same presenter(s) and studio/set, therefore one of the two programmes - depending on the day's news - is pre- recorded 'as live' shortly before broadcast.Seventeen regions into nine: How the updated ITV local news services will run Caitlin Fitzsimmons, The Guardian, 17 February 2009 The ‚ÄúLookaround‚Äù news service transmits to a vast area ‚Äì central and northern Cumbria, Dumfries and Galloway, parts of South Ayrshire, the Scottish Borders and overlap areas of Northumberland. The Isle of Man was also served by ITV Border until 2009. History ITV Border ITV Border's regional news service began on 1 September 1961 from studios at Harraby, Carlisle. Initially producing short evening bulletins and a topical magazine programme called Focus, Lookaround would become the station's flagship daily programme later on in the decade. Shorter bulletins were known as Border News. Meanwhile, the ITV Tyne Tees region had its own wholly separate news services. Lookaround is also known locally in Cumbrian dialect as \\"Border Crack an' Deekabout\\" In 1989, Border began providing a sub-regional news service for viewers served by the Selkirk transmitter, consisting of a short opt-out during Lookaround each weeknight. In April 1999, the opt-out was extended to cover Dumfries and Galloway and a dedicated Scottish news bulletin was introduced on weekday lunchtimes. Border also opened an Edinburgh bureau to provide coverage of the Scottish Parliament.Memorandum submitted by Border Television Limited, parliament.uk, 23 November 2001 ITV Tyne Tees & Border =Proposed merger= In September 2007, ITV plc announced that ITV Border news operations would be merged with ITV Tyne Tees, subject to the approval from the regulator Ofcom.

Considered one of the best Czech social photographers to date, since the 1990s she has photographed children in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and also Poland.  Biography  Luskaƒçov√° was born in Prague. In 1968 she graduated from Charles University there with a thesis on religion in Slovakia.Mellor, No Such Thing as Society, p. 53. During her stay in Slovakia, she became familiar with the old Christian rites and decided to return with a camera to document the surviving traditions. Her thesis was titled Poutƒõ na V√Ωchodn√≠m Slovensku (Pilgrimages in East Slovakia).The Photogeny of Identity (2006), p. 205. In the Pilgrimages cycle she mainly focused on the Slovak village of ≈†umiac.Birgus (2010), p. 156. Following that she studied photography at FAMU, in this period photographing in Slovakia and Poland. From 1970 to 1972, Luskaƒçov√° photographed stage performances of the Za branou theatre, founded by director Otomar Krejƒça. However, the theatre was banned by communists in the spring of 1972. The same year, she was allowed to display the cycle Pilgrims in the Gallery of Visual Arts in Roudnice nad Labem (the curator of the exhibition was the photography theorist and art historian Anna F√°rov√°). In 1971, Luskaƒçov√° married the poet Franz H. Wurm (native of Prague and a British citizen). Wurm, terrified by the \\"Normalization\\" in Czechoslovakia, left the country and Luskaƒçov√° asked the state authorities for permission to visit her husband abroad. After several short visits she received a form for emigration (1975) and went to live in England. However, in an interview she claimed: \\"Bohemia, Prague and ≈†umiac have never ceased to be my home. I always took my life abroad as a kind of stopgap that stretched to be a considerable part of my life.\\" In the 1970s and 1980s, the communist censorship attempted to conceal her international reputation. Her works were banned in Czechoslovakia, and the catalogues for the exhibition Pilgrims in the Victoria and Albert Museum were lost on their way to Czechoslovakia. Luskaƒçov√° started photographing London's markets in 1974.Mellor, No Such Thing as Society, p. 154. In the markets of Portobello Road, Brixton and Spitalfields, she \\"[found] a vivid Dickensian staging\\". As a Magnum Photos nominee, Luskaƒçov√° photographed Chiswick Women's Aid in the 1970s.

Mattheus Lestevenon, the Dutch ambassador to France, became his brother-in-law. With his first wife he had one child, Johan de Graeff, who died at the age of 19. With his second wife he had six children; Abraham (1743‚Äì1744), Pieter (1746‚Äì1762) and Elisabeth Jacoba de Graeff (1748‚Äì1750) died young. * Geertruid Joanna de Graeff (1740‚Äì1801) was first married to Isaac Ernst des H.R. Rijksbaron de Petersen (1737‚Äì1783), and in 1790 to Mr. Fran√ßois Jacob van de Wall (1756‚Äì1834). * Gerrit de Graeff II. (1741‚Äì1811) married in 1765 Christina van Herzeele (1748‚Äì1798). * Elisabeth Jacoba de Graeff 1751‚Äì1802 married in 1768 Jan des H.r. Rijksbaron De Petersen (1745‚Äì1786), the younger brother of Isaac Ernst. Career, art and lifestyle In 1732 De Graeff finished his studies at the University of Leiden. Gerrit de Graeffs Biographie at the \\"DBNL\\" (dutch) In 1736 he became one of the chairmen of the Dutch East Indies Company (VOC). One year later he was also appointed as one of the Chairmen of the Dutch West India Company (WIC). De Graeffs Biographie from Heren van Holland In 1739 he became a member of the vroedschap, and captain in the schutterij. From 1748 to 1752 he was one of the directors of the Company of Surinam and commissaris in Noorderkwartier. Gerrit de Graeff lived at Herengracht, in a mansion now the Tassenmuseum Hendrikje. In the first half of the 18th century an extensive renovation of the building takes place, particularly of the interiors. In the large period room various ceiling paintings and a mantelpiece with richly carved and gilded ornaments were installed. A richly ornamented chimneypiece in the late Louis XIV style was placed in the small period room. Most of the time he resided at his castle Ilpenstein. He also owned Bronstee, a country estate near Heemstede. De Graeff had a famous art collection, and sold some of the family paintings to an art dealer from Hamburg. William VIII, Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel bought Jacob Blessing the Sons of Joseph (the sitters were Wendela de Graeff and her two sons) Rembrandts Jacob Blessing the Sons of Joseph, Staatliche Museen Kassel and the Portrait of Andries de Graeff. Rembrandts Portrait of Andries de Graeff, Staatliche Museen Kassel The two famous paintings, both by Rembrandt, can be seen in Wilhelmsh√∂he in Kassel.

Founded in 1946, it is sub-divided into 32 sections and 58 local divisions. The AVS is based in Bolzano and has more than 60,000 members.AVS z√§hlt √ºber 60.000 Mitglieder, stol.it, 11 September 2013  History  Originally, the South Tyrolean alpine club sections were members of the German and Austrian Alpine Club (Deutscher und √ñsterreichischer Alpenverein). In 1869 the first sections were founded in Bozen and Niederdorf, Puster Valley. By 1910, 15 more sections had been established in South Tyrol. They initiated the construction of 19 mountain huts, an extensive network of paths through the mountains and training for mountain guides. After the end of the First World War, the annexation of South Tyrol by Italy and the coming into power of the fascists, the South Tyrolean sections were disappropriated and banned in 1923 (see Italianization of South Tyrol). After the end of the Second World War, on December 31, 1945, the military administration of the Allies permitted the foundation of the South Tyrol Alpine Club. Its inaugural meeting took place in Bolzano on 14 June 1946. Nowadays, the AVS takes care of more than 9,500 km of hiking trails and is involved in nature conservancy and South Tyrolean cultural issues as well. The club is a member of the Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme and the Club Arc Alpin. In 2007, the AVS finished its project to digitalise all hiking trails in South Tyrol.Website with the digitalised data  Notes   See also  *Austrian Alpine Club  External links  * Homepage of the Alpenverein S√ºdtirol Category:Clubs and societies in Italy Category:Climbing organizations Category:Sport in South Tyrol Category:Alpine clubs ","title":"South Tyrol Alpine Club"},{"id":"21534870","text":"Bourra is a commune in the Cercle of Ansongo in the Gao Region of south- eastern Mali.

Every currency area must decide what type of exchange rate arrangement to maintain. Between permanently fixed and completely flexible however, are heterogeneous approaches. They have different implications for the extent to which national authorities participate in foreign exchange markets. According to their degree of flexibility, post-Bretton Woods-exchange rate regimes are arranged into three categories: currency unions, dollarized regimes, currency boards and conventional currency pegs are described as ‚Äúfixed-rate regimes‚Äù; horizontal bands, crawling pegs and crawling bands are grouped into ‚Äúintermediate regimes‚Äù; and managed and independent floats are described as flexible regimes. All monetary regimes except for the permanently fixed regime experience the time inconsistency problem and exchange rate volatility, albeit to different degrees. Fixed rate programs In a fixed exchange rate system, the monetary authority picks rates of exchange with each other currency and commits to adjusting the money supply, restricting exchange transactions and adjusting other variables to ensure that the exchange rates do not move. All variations on fixed rates reduce the time inconsistency problem and reduce exchange rate volatility, albeit to different degrees. Under dollarization/Euroization, the US dollar or the Euro acts as legal tender in a different country. Dollarization is a summary description of the use of foreign currency in its capacity to produce all types of money services in the domestic economy. Monetary policy is delegated to the anchor country. Under dollarization exchange rate movements cannot buffer external shocks. The money supply in the dollarizing country is limited to what it can earn via exports, borrow and receive from emigrant remittances. A currency board enables governments to manage their external credibility problems and discipline their central banks by ‚Äútying their hands‚Äù with binding arrangements. A currency board combines three elements: an exchange rate that is fixed to another, ‚Äúanchor currency‚Äù; automatic convertibility or the right to exchange domestic currency at this fixed rate whenever desired; and a long-term commitment to the system. A currency board system can ultimately be credible only if central bank holds official foreign exchange reserves sufficient to at least cover the entire monetary base. Exchange rate movements cannot buffer external shocks. A fixed peg system fixes the exchange rate against a single currency or a currency basket. The time inconsistency problem is reduced through commitment to a verifiable target. However, the availability of a devaluation option provides a policy tool for handling large shocks. Its potential drawbacks are that it provides a target for speculative attacks, avoids exchange rate volatility, but not necessarily persistent misalignments, does not by itself place hard constraints on monetary and fiscal policy and that the credibility effect depends on accompanying institutional measures and a visible record of accomplishment. Monetary union A currency or monetary union is a multi- country zone where a single monetary policy prevails and inside which a single currency or multiple substitutable currencies, move freely. A monetary union has common monetary and fiscal policy to ensure control over the creation of money and the size of government debts. It has a central management of the common pool of foreign exchange reserves, external debts and exchange rate policies. The monetary union has common regional monetary authority i.e. common regional central bank, which is the sole issuer of economy wide currency, in the case of a full currency union. The monetary union eliminates the time inconsistency problem within the zone and reduces real exchange rate volatility by requiring multinational agreement on exchange rate and other monetary changes. The potential drawbacks are that member countries suffering asymmetric shocks lose a stabilization tool--the ability to adjust exchange rates. The cost depends on the extent of asymmetric costs and the availability and effectiveness of alternative adjustment tools. Flexible exchange rate  These systems do not particularly reduce time inconsistency problems nor do they offer specific techniques for maintaining low exchange rate volatility. A crawling peg attempts to combine flexibility and stability using a rule-based system for gradually altering the currency's par value, typically at a predetermined rate or as a function of inflation differentials. A crawling peg is similar to a fixed peg; however, it can be adjusted based on clearly defined rules. A crawling peg is often used by (initially) high-inflation countries or developing nations who peg to low inflation countries in attempt to avoid currency appreciation. At the margin a crawling peg provides a target for speculative attacks. Among variants of fixed exchange rates, it imposes the least restrictions, and may hence yield the smallest credibility benefits. The credibility effect depends on accompanying institutional measures and record of accomplishment. Exchange rate bands allow markets to set rates within a specified range; edges of the band are defended through intervention. It provides a limited role for exchange rate movements to counteract external shocks while partially anchoring expectations. This system does not eliminate exchange rate uncertainty and thus motivates development of exchange rate risk management tools. On the margin a band is subject to speculative attacks. It does not by itself place hard constraints on policy, and thus provides only a limited solution to the time inconsistency problem. The credibility effect depends on accompanying institutional measures, a record of accomplishment and whether the band is firm or adjustable, secret or public, band width and the strength of the intervention requirement. Managed float exchange rates are determined in the foreign exchange market. Authorities can and do intervene, but are not bound by any intervention rule. They are often accompanied by a separate nominal anchor, such as an inflation target. The arrangement provides a way to mix market-determined rates with stabilizing intervention in a non- rule-based system. Its potential drawbacks are that it does not place hard constraints on monetary and fiscal policy. It suffers from uncertainty from reduced credibility, relying on the credibility of monetary authorities. It typically offers limited transparency. In a pure float, the exchange rate is determined in the market without public sector intervention. Adjustments to shocks can take place through exchange rate movements. It eliminates the requirement to hold large reserves. However, this arrangement does not provide an expectations anchor. The exchange rate regime itself does not imply any specific restriction on monetary and fiscal policy.

The ideal is to help comrades in need, either financially or physically; and to remember all servicemen who have answered the Sunset Call, both in war and peacetime.SESA 1974, pp. 327‚Äì28. Formation M.O.T.H. Shellhole, Bloemfontein. According to the Dictionary of South African Biography, one night in 1927 after he and the editor of The Natal Mercury, RJ Kingston Russell, had seen a war film, Charles Evenden was persuaded to draw a cartoon on 'remembrance'. According to the Dictionary, \\"The cartoon showed a tin helmet surmounted by a burning candle. Around the flames of the candle were six words ‚Äì True Comradeship ‚Äì Mutual Help ‚Äì Sound Memory\\".DSAB 1987, pp. 250‚Äì51. However, the official M.O.T.H. website carries a cartoon captioned Forgetfulness and this led to the founding of the Order. This is confirmed by the Eastern Province Herald which describes the cartoon as follows: \\"a bullet- and shrapnel-riddled Allied helmet awash in the ocean. In the background a steamship passes over the horizon, leaving the forgotten, ghostly form of a veteran forlornly wading through the water.\\" \\"The concepts of True Comradeship, Mutual Help and Sound Memory were to become the inspiration of a remarkable organisation of ex-front line soldiers, of all ranks, known as M.O.T.H. Evenden, as the founder of the movement and its guiding inspiration was given the title of Moth O ‚Äì a position he held until his death.\\" The membership of the M.O.T.H. movement, under Evenden's vigorous direction and leadership, grew into thousands. Men and women of two world wars, of the Second Anglo Boer War (1899‚Äì1902) and even those of former enemy forces streamed into its ranks. All who were prepared to keep alive the memories of comradeship and self-sacrifice ‚Äì the finer virtues that war brings forth ‚Äì were welcomed and made at home in shell holes as the meeting premises are called with colourful and meaningful names of war-time memories and occasions.

Personal history Benhama was born in Al Khmissat, Morocco in 1982. Athletics career Benhama, who trains out of Association Handisport Ennasser in Sal√©, made her senior debut as a T13 classification athlete at a meet in Rabat in 2008.

She competed in four events, the three sprints and the long jump. In the long jump she made the last eight allowing her to compete at three more attempts, but with her best some distance from the leading pack Benhama withdrew with two jumps remaining, finishing in sixth place. It was in the sprint events that Benhama made an impact at the Games. She began with the 400 metre sprint, qualifying in the fastest time and then setting a new Paralympic record of 55.56 seconds in the finals to take her first gold medal of the Games. She followed this two days later with another gold, this time in the 200 metres, in which she beat her nearest rival, France's Nantenin Ke√Øta by over half a second.

The principal town lies at Tine Aouker. As of 1998 the commune had a population of 2,088. Creation The rural commune Tilemsi enshrined in Act No. 96-059 of 4 November 1996 on the creation of Municipalities in the Republic of Mali is the result of the bursting of the Borough of Dj√©bock in the Circle Gao in two towns rural (and Anchawadj Tilemsi). Its main town is located in Tin Aouker the fossil valley Tilemsi on transsaharienne 70 km north of the city of Gao. The rural commune Tilemsi is limited: \\\\- To the north by the rural commune of Tarkint; \\\\- To the south by the rural commune of Anchawadj; \\\\- To the east by the rural communes of Anefis (Circle of Kidal) and Alata (Circle Menaka) \\\\- To the west by the rural communes of Soni Ali Ber (Circle Gao) and Taboye (Circle Bourem). Geography The rural commune Tilemsi has very modest relief composed of large expanses of plains (fossil valley Tilemsi) and a few trays means recognized and appreciated by the quality of their herbaceous (Azawa). The rural commune Tilemsi knows a Sahelian climate characterized by alternating two seasons. A dry season from 10 to 11 months and a rainy season from 1 to 2 months with rain precipitation rarely reaching 100 mm of water per year. Average annual temperatures vary in the range of 30 to 45 ¬∞C. The main harmattan winds and the monsoon. Very poor vegetation in the valley Tilemsi, it consists of thorny shrubs in places while we note the presence of a grassy savanna. The rural commune Tilemsi has some temporary pools and wadis using fallback area for livestock during the dry season around which settled communities. Demography The rural commune Tilemsi has a population of 16,411 inhabitants on the basis of a fiscal administrative census conducted by the municipality in March 2004. White and black population both composed mainly of Tuareg and Arabs. The main dominant religion is Islam. The main migration flows are directed to neighboring towns and Anchawadj Gao, Niger, Algeria and Libya. Economy The rural municipality has 07 sectors Tilemsi pastoral and agro-development: \\\\- Agharous (Agharous - Tin Adhidj - F√®senf√®s - Inhouchaw√®ne); \\\\- Azerzi (Amasrakad - Tadakamat - Taward√©); \\\\- Alata (Ernadjef - Tin Alher - Tidjalal√®ne); \\\\- Tilemsi (Tin-Aouker Intaghat - Ardjabech - Tinersane); \\\\- Inabarem (Tin Adjhanan - Intamat); \\\\- Intesimt (Inadalab - Ifardane - Talhaninit); \\\\- Assalwa (Ebaghaw Afer-Tin - Tidjerw√®ne - Ifalawlaw√®ne) For breeding, first activity on cattle, sheep, goats, donkeys, camels, it is like the other depends on the lack of equipment, organization and training of farmers. Agriculture focuses on sorghum and cowpea recession. To this is added the agriculture practiced in some gardening sites. The City has several weekly markets in Tin Aouker Tidjerw√®ne and Amasrakad which sell grain, livestock, textiles and other products (tea, sugar, tobacco). The main areas of supply are Gao and southern Algeria. Picking is less important compared with other activities because Tilemsi has fewer grasses and acacias, source collection. Crafts focus on the leather products (bags, shoes, pillows, bags ...) and products of the forge (knives, hoes, dabas, hoes, rakes, hoes, axes ....) The City has only one park located Tin Aouker vaccination. Its poor geographical position in relation to pasture leads farmers to vaccinate their animals in the neighboring towns with all the problems that pose. La area has no deposit veterinarian. The supply of vaccines and veterinary products is from the city of Gao. Commune by the pastoral has no hydro-agricultural development. Agriculture is subsistence type and practiced by a minority of the population. With regard to water projects Commune has twenty pastoral wells, ten boreholes with pump in India or Dubai and two solar pumps. These boreholes and wells unevenly distributed not cover the water needs of people and livestock. They know issues or maintenance of their equipment. Tin market Aouker received 4 hangars built by the NGO Tassaght and Project Development Support Local needs and other amenities such as shops, additional hangars and warehouses. Cereal banks are provided under the Commune in stores and cereal banks. The few stores that are unevenly distributed can not meet the demand of the people. These stores are mostly victims of mismanagement, lack of supervision and poor organization of beneficiaries. The City has never owned a decentralized financial system. All loans towards populations are taken from a bank Gao (BNDA) located 70 km from the capital. These loans are with exorbitant interest creating more problems than solutions. The rural commune Tilemsi ties based on social and traditional cultural and agro complementarities with 13 villages in the rural commune of Soni Ali Ber Circle Gao (Zindiga, Berrah Seyna, Batal, Magnadou√©, Kokorom, Kochakarey, Forgho Arma Forgho Songhoy, Hamakouladji, Mbald√©, Kareybandia, Bagnadji) as well as villages and ethnocultural groups in the rural commune of Taboye and Circle Bourem. The rural commune Tilemsi share farming as their main activity and production of wealth with the rural communes of neighboring pastoral Tarkint (Circle Bourem) of Anefis (Circle of Kidal), Alata (Circle of Menaka) and Anchawadj (Circle Gao). Society Constraints are: \\\\- Weakness and lack of agricultural products; \\\\- Lack of pasture; \\\\- Significant loss of livestock due to disease outbreaks; \\\\- Low income people; \\\\- Enclosing and remoteness of some areas lack of rural roads; \\\\- Food insecurity; Despite its size the municipality has only one Community Health Centre located in town (Tin Aouker). The Health Centre by its geographical position does not meet all the demands of the people. Other sites are required to bring their patients in health centers in neighboring towns. The rural commune Tilemsi has 13 primary schools and Second Cycle in main town. All these schools have been built with the advent of decentralization and face problems of equipment and Teachers. The erection of Tin Aouker Tilemsi Circle in the Gao Region with 02 Districts is a democratic demand of its people: -Tin-District Aouker, Chief town Aouker Tin with 02 rural communes namely Tilemsi and F√®senf√®s; -District of Azerzi, Chief town Amasrakad with 02 rural communes namely Amasrakad and Tinadhidj; Administrative reform and the deepening of decentralization provide the best opportunity to build the City Circle in Tilemsi same name under all the advantages that only need to be valued and capitalized only service of peace, security, democracy and development in our country; The recent creation of the Region of Menaka and Circle Almoustarat, making both borders with the territory of the Municipality Tilemsi offers for the same reasons an opportunity to create beneficial circle for Tilemsi ensures better administration and management issues of peace, security and development on the one hand but also to strengthen the role and place of buffer and stabilization Tilemsi between the three regions of Gao, Kidal and Menaka. Our country is facing major challenges: combat poverty, fight against insecurity, complete decentralization and deepen democracy. The erection of the City Circle in Tilemsi takes into account all these issues and proceeds from the Malian Government's political will to involve people and communities in the management of power in the administration closer to its users: The erection of the rural commune Circle Tilemsi be a valuable contribution because it not only helps to reinforce the important role already undertaken by people and politicians in the fight against insecurity, but also to create the conditions of deepening and consolidation; This will also erect a deepening of decentralization and democracy through the promotion of social and economic balances as at local and regional level.

The episode was written by Brian Tanen and directed by David Warren. Plot As the day begins, It looks like the events in the wake of Connor's recent cleaning of Meade Publications, everybody trying to survive financially. For the Suarez family, even as Betty tries her best to cut back on her work attire (sort of), the family are noticing Ignacio watching \\"Kitchen Rumble\\", a cooking show hosted by Frankie Burrata, in which he challenges anyone to beat him at his cooking from their home. But moments later, Hilda gets a surprise letter from their landlord: they're being evicted from their home because the owner has opted to sell the place. The family, seeing that they have no resources, tries unusual money- making schemes; Betty going to Amanda and Marc, Hilda charging $200.00 for a perm and Justin taking to the streets as a performer. As those attempts fail, Ignacio has succeeded in getting the challenge from Burrata to come to the residence so they can win the $10,000 cook-off. Meanwhile, Daniel, Wilhelmina and Claire each bicker over the now-bankrupt company, not to mention Daniel and Wilhelmina being at odds over their relationships with Molly and Connor which started this freefall. Claire of course comes up with a brainstorm idea: have the government bail them out. While they like the idea, it looks like Daniel and Wilhelmina are having a hard time trying to make ends meet en route to a hearing to determine if the company qualifies as they first endure a New York City bus ride that doesn't accept credit cards or US$50 bills. After their first day of grilling by a financial committee, the two have lunch at an expensive restaurant to console themselves over what has happened. On the day of the taping, the family, along with Matt, are on hand to see Ignacio go face to face with Burrata, who has a weird way of getting to know his challengers as Ignacio would find out soon enough. As the show starts taping, the competition between the two gets intense as they try to beat the clock and get their meal completed before they can serve the judges. Unfortunately, just ten minutes into the final stage, Ignacio began to throws out his back and could not continue, even as Burrata told the viewers that there are no time outs on the show. So with no other choice, the family turn to Betty, who ends up finishing the meal. As the meals are served to the judges, they finally declared their winner: Frankie Burrata! The Suarezes are stunned by this loss in more ways than one. The following day, Ignacio and Hilda get a major surprise in the mail: $10,000.00! While Hilda was excited about this, Betty believed that it might have come from Daniel, who had offered earlier to help pay for the home, but Daniel said it wasn't him who sent the money. Also that same day, it looks like that visit to the restaurant would be bought up by the committee chairman after he shows off a picture of Daniel and Wilhelmina at the restaurant, even as the two tried to explain what happened. However the committee rejected their request. Back at MODE, Daniel tells Wilhelmina and Claire about another idea that would keep the company afloat by selling his assets and stocks, a move spurred on by Wilhelmina and Claire, who also opted to spin off their belongings. That evening at a bar, Betty and Matt chat over about how her family ended up with the money. Matt, who then thanked Betty for bailing him out even after losing his wallet and coming up short of cash, then tells her that now that he can pay for the drinks and when the waiter came to give Matt the bill, Matt signed the receipt and went to the bathroom. Unfortunately, Betty would get a look at the signature, which matched that of the check! When Matt returned, Betty confronted him about why he did it. Matt then explained that he comes from a wealthy family and that he doesn't care about his background. Betty was not happy about him helping her family and leaves. Later on, Betty returns and discovers that Hilda and Justin are stunned over Ignacio accepting Burrata's offer to work at his restaurant. It turned out that Burrata had a change of heart after the taping. The family can now keep their home, just in time for them to see Ignacio on \\"Kitchen Rumble\\". Betty later meets up with Matt and apologises to him for snapping because she was angry, but he tells her that he will not treat her as a charity again. As Betty says she feels like she doesn't know much about him, Matt admits that he really is into her. The two then share their first kiss. The thoughts of Molly and Connor were still fresh in the minds of Daniel and Wilhelmina. As Wilhelmina opens her desk and sees a picture of Connor for a brief moment, Daniel, with the encouragement of Betty, finally goes after Molly and tells her that he wants to still be there for her as she faces her battle with cancer. Finally, in between these events, Marc tries to help Amanda deal with confronting her adopted mother after she lied to her two years earlier, while Marc spots a hunk named Timothy with child in tow during a baby shopping spree with Amanda that same day. For Marc, his idea to win over his new obsession by lying to him about being a dad himself, would mean using William to lure him. So they turn to Christina, who is watching William, saying that Wilhelmina wants him to bond with the baby. However, those plans get scrubbed when Timothy shows up sans baby, resulting in Marc lying to the guy that Amanda was his nanny. As Amanda returned William to Christina, Christina gave some motherly advice about being truthful, especially about being adopted. In the end, Marc returned hours later to tell Amanda that the guy of his dreams wasn't that interesting to him, then apologized to Amanda for bailing out on her. Amanda then called her adopted mother to talk to her. Continuity There were errors over the issue of the Suarez home and who was the owner. In the first season, it was mentioned the Suarezes owned their home, but in this episode the home was owned by the landlord. Music The ending song of this episode is sung by Brett Dennen, called \\"Ain't Gonna Lose You\\". Casting Although his photo was shown, Grant Bowler (Connor Owens) did not appear in this episode, but he was credited.

It usually involves removal of thrombi (blood clots), and is then referred to as thrombectomy. Embolectomy is an emergency procedure often as the last resort because permanent occlusion of a significant blood flow to an organ leads to necrosis. Other involved therapeutic options are anticoagulation and thrombolysis. Medical uses Surgical embolectomy for massive pulmonary embolism (PE) has become a rare procedure and is often viewed as a last resort. Thrombolytic therapy has become the treatment of choice. Surgical or catheter embolectomy is normally performed in patients with pulmonary embolism (formed from venous embolisms). Embolectomy is used for patients with persisting shock despite supportive care and who have an absolute contraindication for thrombolytic therapy. And although other treatments have improved urgent surgical embolectomy or catheter embolectomy may be a life saving procedure in severe pulmonary embolism. Embolectomies are performed as limb-sparing techniques for arterial embolisms in acute limb ischemia. However, there are also other options, such as catheter-directed thrombolysis and anticoagulation with observation. It can also be used for other ischemias due to embolism for example mesenteric ischemia and stroke. Methods Illustration of an AngioJet; coronary thrombectomy Catheter embolectomy =Balloon embolectomy= Typically this is done by inserting a catheter with an inflatable balloon attached to its tip into an artery, passing the catheter tip beyond the clot, inflating the balloon, and removing the clot by withdrawing the catheter. The catheter is called Fogarty, named after its inventor Thomas J. Fogarty. Possible complications of balloon embolectomy include intimal lesions, which can lead to another thrombosis.Kirurgiska √•tg√§rder vid akut ischemi i nedre extremitet. (Google Translate: Surgical measures in acute ischemia of lower extremities.) Pekka Aho och Pirkka Vikatmaa. Finska L√§kares√§llskapets Handlingar (Finnish Medical Society Documents). No. 1, 2003 The vessel may also be affected by a dissection or rupture. The procedure may lead to cholesterol embolism from atherosclerotic plaques. =Aspiration embolectomy= Catheter embolectomy is also used for aspiration embolectomy, where the thrombus is removed by suction rather than pushing with a balloon. It is a rapid and effective way of removing thrombi in thromboembolic occlusions of the limb arteries below the inguinal ligament, as in leg infarction. Surgical embolectomy Surgical embolectomy is the simple surgical removal of a clot following incision into a vessel by open surgery on the artery.MDGuidelines > Arterial Embolism And Thrombosis From The Medical Disability Advisor by Presley Reed, MD. Retrieved on April 30, 2010 Outcome Outcome of embolectomy varies with size and location of the embolus. In pulmonary embolism recent data shows mortality as being approximately 20%. Although this is a high mortality, it may have life- saving potential in some instances. Background Emboli are abnormal masses of material (which can be solid, liquid or gas) that are carried in the blood stream from one part of the circulation to another causing a blockage (occlusion) of a blood vessel that leads to lack of oxygen supply (ischemia) and finally infarction of tissue downstream of the embolus. The most common type of emboli are a blood clot generated by thrombosis which has then broken off and is then transported in the blood stream (see embolism). There are two areas where emboli can form and therefore impact: * Arterial emboli form in the left side of the heart or the main arteries, they impact in body tissues but not the lungs, commonly in the brain and the small vessels in the upper and lower limbs * Venous emboli arise in veins (for example emboli which form from deep venous thrombosis or DVT) and these impact in the lung (see pulmonary embolism).

On 7 October 2015, he officially became an Australian citizen, making him eligible to play for the Australian national team. Club career Henrique played his youth football in Brazil with Am√©rica Mineiro and in 2003 joined Dutch giants Feyenoord. After failing to break into the first team, Henrique returned to Brazil where he played senior football with Am√©rica and was loaned out to several other Brazilian clubs. Henrique is nicknamed the Slippery Fish. Brisbane Roar Henrique joined Brisbane Roar initially as a temporary injury replacement for fellow Brazilian Reinaldo in February 2009, after impressing coach Frank Farina in a week-long trial after being given permission to talk with the Australian club by Am√©rica. He made his first appearance as a second-half substitute in the Roar's second-leg 2‚Äì1 win over Central Coast Mariners in the 2009 A-League semi-finals. There was minor controversy due to the transfer being completed only four hours before his debut appearance. Henrique signed a one-year contract with the Roar on 4 March 2009, after impressing during his loan spell. On 17 September 2009, he signed a new three-year deal with the Roar. Henrique missed up to two months of the 2010‚Äì11 season because of a broken arm, which he injured in a match against Melbourne Victory. Henrique came back as a wild card for the Roar and in the 2010‚Äì11 grand final against Central Coast Mariners, scored a goal in extra- time and the winning penalty. On 4 May 2014, Henrique scored the winning goal against the Western Sydney Wanderers in the 2014 Hyundai A-League Grand Final at Suncorp Stadium. On 14 November 2014, Henrique came off the bench and scored a hat-trick as Brisbane Roar registered their first win of the season with a 4‚Äì0 result over Newcastle. Henrique finished the season rather early, as he was required to undergo knee reconstruction, effectively ruling him out for the rest of 2014‚Äì15. Despite this, he finished 2014‚Äì15 as his most successful, netting eight goals in 16 games. Henrique netted a stunning goal, his third of the season, from half-way, lengthwise equivalent to 45 metres, as Roar defeated Melbourne City 3‚Äì1. On 16 June 2016, it was announced that Henrique would depart the Roar after seven seasons with the club. Adelaide United On 27 August 2016, Henrique joined Adelaide United on a one-year deal. On 4 December 2016, Henrique scored a brace against Wellington Phoenix to win Adelaide United's first match of the 16/17 season, as the match ended 2‚Äì0. Chiangrai United On 31 January 2017, Henrique left Adelaide United after 13 games to join Thai club Chiangrai United Return to Brisbane Roar After training with Brisbane Roar and the club announcing they won't sign Henrique for the current season, on 22 February 2018, the club back- flipped on their decision and signed Henrique, including him in the match-day squad for the current round. In December 2018, Henrique reached 150 games with Brisbane Roar and also scored a goal during the game against Adelaide United. He left the Roar after the 2018/19 season.

During the coronavirus pandemic, the AHA asked Congress to provide $100 billion in aid to hospitals for coronavirus testing and treatment. History In 1870, there were only about 100 general hospitals in the United States, but the institution was growing rapidly. Hospital administrators formed an organization, The Association of Hospital Superintendents of the United States and Canada, which held its first meeting in 1899 in Cleveland, Ohio, where seven of the eight superintendents in attendance were based. The organization was promoted by publisher Del Sutton, whose journal, The National Hospital Sanitarium Record, was adopted by the group in 1900, gradually coming under control of the organization until it was replaced by the organization's own publication, The Modern Hospital. In 1906, the organization adopted its present name. Membership was 450 in 1908. Records of early annual meetings detail some of the conflicts in the emerging hospital culture of Canada and the United States concerning whether hospitals should be governed by physicians or administrators, with non-professionals representing a heavy majority. Current ongoing research into the cost-effectiveness of such a decision has led to an increasing health disparity as administrative overhead makes up a disproportionate amount of health cost.https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/wage-gap-between-hospital- executives-and-doctors-widening-study-shows Professional Membership Groups Professional Membership Groups (PMGs) are affiliated societies which fall under the umbrella of the AHA: * American Society for Healthcare Engineering (ASHE) * American Society for Healthcare Human Resources Administration (ASHHRA) * American Society for Healthcare Risk Management (ASHRM) * Association for Community Health Improvement (ACHI) * Association for the Healthcare Environment (AHE) * Association for Healthcare Resource & Materials Management (AHRMM) * Association for Healthcare Volunteer Resource Professionals (AHVRP) * At Large AHA Membership for Healthcare Management/Consulting Professionals * Society for Healthcare Strategy and Market Development (SHSMD) *Institute for Diversity and Health Equity See also * The New York Foundation * National Uniform Billing Committee * Federation of American Hospitals References External links * Category:1898 establishments in the United States Category:Hospitals in the United States Category:Health care-related professional associations based in the United States Category:Business and industry organizations based in Chicago Category:Human welfare organizations based in Chicago Category:Professional associations based in the United States ","title":"American Hospital Association"},{"id":"21535236","text":"Severiano √Ålvarez (1933 ‚Äì September 23, 2013) was a Leonese language writer.

Its highest point is the Bungsberg (168 metres above sea level).Carl Ingwer Johannsen & Eckardt Opitz: Das grosse Schleswig-Holstein- Buch. Hamburg 1996 It is a designated nature park as well as an important tourist destination in Northern Germany situated between the cities of Kiel and L√ºbeck. Geography Holstein Switzerland lies in eastern Schleswig- Holstein. This picturesque region in the historical county of Wagria has no precise political or geographic boundaries. Most of the area falls within the districts of Ostholstein and Pl√∂n, roughly between the cities of L√ºbeck and Kiel and extends as far north as the Baltic coast. Its major towns include Bad Malente-Gremsm√ºhlen, L√ºtjenburg, Oldenburg in Holstein, Preetz and the old Residenz seats of Eutin and Pl√∂n. The charm of this region is its ever- changing landscape of the Young Drift moraines of the Schleswig-Holstein Uplands which were formed during the last ice age. Small woods alternate rapidly with hedged, arable fields and the terrain is characterised by its many lakes nestling amongst low hills. Amongst the more well-known lakes are the Gro√üer Pl√∂ner See, the Dieksee and the Kellersee. Rivers and water meadows abound, such as the Schwentine, which flows into Kiel Fjord or the Kossau, which discharges into the Gro√üer Binnensee. The highest elevation is the Bungsberg near Sch√∂nwalde. With the only ski lift in Schleswig-Holstein and a height of above NN it is also the highest hill in the state.  Origin of the name  The German name for the region, Holsteinische Schweiz, goes back to the 19th century when holidaying in Switzerland was particularly popular amongst the well-to-do. As a consequence, other regions strove to add the name \\"Switzerland\\" to their description. (By this time, Saxon Switzerland had already been known as such for a century). On 20 May 1885 Johannes Janus opened the Hotel Holsteinische Schweiz at Malente on the Kellersee which enjoyed enormous popularity. The name of the hotel was then transferred to Holsteinische Schweiz station and, later, to the whole region.  History  Holstein Switzerland has been settled for several thousand years. In the Early Middle Ages part of the area was occupied by the Slavic Wends, whose traces may still be found, for example, in Oldenburg, and who founded the settlements of Pl√∂n and Eutin. In the Middle Ages, from the 9th century onwards, the region was colonised and controlled by the Carolingian Empire. In the late Middle Ages the towns developed into small centres of local commerce and the local feudal lords (Landadel) expanded their fortified manor houses. At the beginning of the recent era, these manorial seats formed the basis of aristocratic estates (Adliges G√ºter) which dominated the landscape and the economy from about 1500 until the 20th century. From the 16th century Pl√∂n and Eutin became residences of various branches of the House of Oldenburg. These estates had a thriving cultural scene which, for example, led to Eutin being described at the turn of the 19th century as the \\"Weimar of the North\\". Until the middle of the 19th century the area was dominated by Denmark, which initially ran the region as a feoff, but eventually integrated it into the Danish nation-state. In 1867 Holstein Switzerland was transferred to Prussia as part of Holstein. After the end of the First World War some of the traditional estates were broken up. Following the Second World War, tourism has played a leading role in the economy of the region.  Tourism  The rural landscape is still characterised by large, aristocratic estates and historic forms of farming that are mainly tied into large farm estates and their associated manor houses. These include Panker, Testorf, Rantzau and Hagen in Probsteierhagen. Several of the castles, such as Eutin and Pl√∂n may be visited and many of the estate farms are open to the public during the Schleswig-Holstein Musik Festival or other events. Salzau Estate houses the state cultural centre. For walkers, the nature park trail (Naturparkweg) links the five nature parks in Schleswig-Holstein. There is an extensive network of cycle paths and quiet lanes and tracks for cyclists. Some of the large lakes are plied by pleasure boats and canoeing and other water pursuits are also possible. There are several seaside resorts close by on the Baltic coast.

It is one of the city palazzi of the Thiene family that Palladio worked upon, the other being Palazzo Thiene in the near contr√† Porti. Since 1994 the palace has formed part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site the current name of which is \\"City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto\\".  History  There are more doubts than certainties surrounding the history of the urban villa that Francesco Thiene built on family properties at the eastern extremity of the Strada Maggiore (today the Corso Palladio), beginning with the exact date of its construction. At Palladio‚Äôs death the building had still not been executed: on the Pianta Angelica of 1580, in fact, there still appear only old houses and a garden. A document of 1586 records that construction had still not begun, but certainly in 1593, on the death of the patron Francesco Thiene, the palace was at least a third built. Enea Thiene, who inherited the estate of his uncle Francesco, carried works to their conclusion, probably within the first decade of the 17th century. In 1835 the palace was acquired by Lelio Bonin Longare. In his treatise L'idea della architettura universale (published in Venice in 1615), Vincenzo Scamozzi writes that he was responsible for completing the building‚Äôs construction on the basis of a project by another architect (without specifying whom) with certain revisions to the original design (which, he does not clarify). The architect that Scamozzi does not name is certainly Andrea Palladio, because two autograph sheets survive which can be referred to Francesco Thiene‚Äôs palace: on these are traced two plan variants, substantially close to the present building, as well as a sketch for the fa√ßade which is very different from that executed. It is unclear when Palladio formulated his own ideas for the palazzo, but it is credible that he did so in 1572, the year in which Francesco Thiene and his uncle Orazio divided up the family properties and the former obtained the very site where Palladio‚Äôs edifice would rise.  Architecture  If one analyses the realised building, various elements stand out which favour a dating to the 1570s: for example, the many points of contact with the Palazzo Barbaran da Porto, both in the design of the lower part and in the great, double-storey loggia of the courtyard. Instead, the side could be the work of Vincenzo Scamozzi, given its affinities with the Palazzo Trissino by the Duomo. The deep atrium, which is substantially indifferent to the grid of architectural orders, could also be by Scamozzi and while the rooms on its right, as one enters, clearly reuse rather irregular, pre-existing walls, those on the left are perfectly regular and evidently rise from new foundations.

Portfolio investments are held directly by an investor or managed by financial professionals. In economics, foreign portfolio investment is the entry of funds into a country where foreigners deposit money in a country's bank or make purchases in the country's stock and bond markets, sometimes for speculation. Appleyard, Dennis; Alfred J. Field, Jr (2014). International Economics, Indian Edition, 8e, p. 234. Synopsis Most foreign portfolio investments consist of securities and other foreign financial assets that are passively held by the foreign investor. This does not provide the foreign investor with direct ownership of the financial assets and can be relatively liquid depending on the volatility of the market that the investment takes place in. Foreign portfolio investments can be made by individuals, companies, or even governments in international countries. This type of investment is a way for investors to diversify their portfolio with an international advantage. Foreign portfolio investment shows up in a country's capital account. It is also part of the balance of payments which measures the amount of money flowing in and out of a country over a given time period. Foreign portfolio investment is similar, but differs from foreign direct investment. In foreign portfolio investment the investor purchases stocks, securities and other financial assets but does not actively manage the investments or the companies that are issuing the assets. So, in FPI the investor does not have direct control over the securities or businesses. This means that FPI tends to be more liquid and less risky than FDI. The relatively high liquidity of FPI's makes them much easier to sell than FDI's. Foreign portfolio investments also tend to have a shorter time frame for returns than foreign direct investments.https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreign- portfolio-investment-fpi.asp Some benefits that come to investors from utilizing foreign portfolio investments include:https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/061515/what-are-advantages- foreign-portfolio-investment.asp *Portfolio diversification: FPI gives investors a fairly simple way to diversify their portfolio internationally. *International Credit: FPI gives investors a larger credit base because they are able to access credit in the foreign countries that they have large amounts of investment in. *Benefits from the Exchange rates: If an investor has an FPI in a foreign country with a stronger currency than their own country the difference in exchange rates between the two countries can benefit the investor *Access to a larger market: Often markets may be larger and less competitive outside of ones home country. For example, the market is much more competitive in the United States of America than in other less developed economies. Investors can take advantage of the less competitive markets internationally by using these Foreign portfolio investments. Portfolio investments typically involve transactions in securities that are highly liquid, i.e. they can be bought and sold very quickly. A portfolio investment is an investment made by an investor who is not involved in the management of a company. This is in contrast to direct investment, which allows an investor to exercise a certain degree of managerial control over a company. Equity investments where the owner holds less than 10% of a company's shares are classified as portfolio investment. These transactions are also referred to as \\"portfolio flows\\" and are recorded in the financial account of a country's balance of payments. Portfolio flows arise through the transfer of ownership of securities from one country to another. Foreign portfolio investment is positively influenced by high rates of return and reduction of risk through geographic diversification. The returns on foreign portfolio investment can come from interest payments, non-voting dividends, increases in the market value of securities held in the portfolio, the foreign currency becoming stronger relative to the home currency, or some combination of the previous factors.

SSSI Hatfield Moors is the remaining part of a once more extensive raised bog in the Humberhead Levels, and is the second largest lowland raised peat bog in England. Much peat has been removed from the site over the years but peat-cutting has now stopped, and the bog is being allowed to regenerate. Underlying the peat are moraines of sand and gravel, which rise to the surface in one place, forming Lindholme Island. This is the site of a late neolithic timber trackway discovered in 2004, about long, with rails about apart, extending from dry land across a shallow pool to a wooden platform. The timber used was poles of pine, a reflection on the local availability of the tree at the time it was built. On drier patches plants include the dwarf shrubs heather and cross-leaved heath, in wetter places common cottongrass, hare's-tail cottongrass, bog cranberry, bog-rosemary, bog- myrtle and several species of Sphagnum moss. The invertebrate fauna includes the rare mire pill beetle, and other uncommon species of beetle, the bog rush cricket and the large heath butterfly. Birds that breed here include various heathland passerines as well as the nightingale, nightjars and three species of owl.

It is not to be confused with Coccinella transversoguttata, a widespread species in Europe and North America also known as the transverse ladybird. The alternative vernacular of small transverse ladybird may be used for C. transversalis in instances where these two species are discussed together. The transverse ladybird was first described by Danish zoologist Johan Christian Fabricius in 1781 as Coccinella transversalis and still bears its original name. Fabricius' description predated Carl Peter Thunberg's naming of this species as C. repanda by several months. Measuring long and wide, the transverse ladybird shows little variation across its wide range. It has a black head with predominantly bright red or orange elytra boldly marked with a black band down the midline and two lateral three-lobed markings. Prey Like many species of ladybirds, the transverse ladybird plays an important role in agriculture as it preys on a wide array of plant-eating insects which damage crops, particularly early in the growing season. Among those insects hunted include many species of aphids, including the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum), Aphis affinis, cowpea aphid (Aphis craccivora), cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii), milkweed aphid (Aphis nerii), spirea aphid (Aphis spiraecola), leafcurling plum aphid (Brachycaudus helichrysi), cabbage aphid (Brevicoryne brassicae), Cervaphis quercus, Cervaphis rappardi indica, turnip aphid (Lipaphis pseudobrassicae), Macrosiphoniella yomogifoliae, potato aphid (Macrosiphum euphorbiae), rose aphid (Macrosiphum rosae), Melanaphis donacis, Melanaphis sacchari, Myzus nicotianae, green peach aphid (Myzus persicae), Pentalonia nigronervosa, corn aphid (Rhopalosiphum maidis), Sitobion rosaeiformis, Taoia indica, Toxoptera aurantii, Therioaphis ononidis, Therioaphis trifolii, Uroleucon compositae and Uroleucon sonchi, species of leafhopper including Empoascanara indica and Idioscopus clypealis, the scale insect species Orthezia insignis, the Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri), the cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera), and oriental leafworm moth (Spodoptera litura).

The island is owned by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation and operated as Rock Island Lighthouse State Park. The lighthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in November 1978. History Sketch of the original Rock Island Lighthouse as it appeared in 1868. Rock Island Light was first constructed in 1848 as one of three lights approved by the United States Congress for aiding navigation in the Thousand Islands region of the Saint Lawrence River. The other lights constructed at the same time were Crossover Island Light and Sunken Rock Light, both located east of Rock Island. The original structure was a combination brick house and light, with the lantern centered on the house's pitched roof. This structure was replaced in 1882 with a separate iron tower that held the light aloft near the center of the island; the current two-story Victorian house was built in 1884. Problems arose due to the new light being blocked by the two-story home and trees on the island; it was during this time that the A.E. Vickery sank near the island in 1889. The tower's platform was raised by in 1894 to help increase visibility, and finally the tower and light was moved to a brick base constructed off the north side of the island in 1903, where it remains today. Additional structures remaining on the island include a smokehouse (built c. 1847), a carpenter's shop (1882), a generator house (1900), and a boathouse (1920). Among the keepers hired to maintain the light was William Johnston, a man once known as \\"The Pirate of the Thousand Islands\\" for his actions as an American sympathizer during the Patriot War. In May 1838, Johnston and a small force overwhelmed the crew of the British mail steamer Sir Robert Peel; not having enough men to man the steamer, he set it on fire and ran it against a small island in the Saint Lawrence River, henceforth known as Peel Island. Johnston was declared an outlaw by the U.S. government, and was captured and tried several times before finally receiving a pardon. After being pardoned, Johnston took up the role of keeper at Rock Island Light, serving there from 1853 to 1861. Rock Island Light was last used as an official aid to navigation in 1958. The island was put up for sale in 1968 before being transferred to the Thousand Islands Bridge Authority in 1971. The New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation assumed control of the property in 1976, at which time it was opened as Rock Island Lighthouse State Park. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places two years later. In 2007, the New York State Council of Parks, Recreation and Historical Preservation received a $900,000 grant from the US Department of Transportation as part of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users. The grant, matched by $200,000 in state money, was for restoration and development of a method of presenting the lighthouse's historical information and context to the public. The restoration planned for expanding the dock, restoring the lighthouse and keeper's quarters, establishing a museum, and providing water, sewer and electrical service to the island. A.E. Vickery shipwreck The A.E. Vickery sank August 17, 1889 when it struck a shoal while entering the American Narrows destined for Wisers Distillery at Prescott, Ontario, Canada. The boat now rests near Rock Island and is an underwater diving attraction in the Thousand Islands. Rock Island Lighthouse State Park Rock Island Lighthouse State Park is a state park that encompasses the entirety of Rock Island and its former light station. It was created after New York State acquired the property in 1976. Access to the island is possible only by private or chartered boat. The nearest public launch site is located at Grass Point State Park, which is approximately five minutes away by boat. Public boat tours are also available from Clayton. As of 2015, the park is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekends from Memorial Day until late June, and is open daily between late June and Labor Day. It is once again open only on weekends from Labor Day until Columbus Day. The park allows for viewing the surrounding area from the top of the lighthouse, and includes a museum maintained in the former keeper's quarters. A fee is charged to access the museum and lighthouse.

Initially there were two running lines when the station opened in 1847. A third up line was added between Bulkington and Rugby in 1871, for which an extra arch was built for the bridge. This became a passenger line in 1876 utilising the opposite side of the up platform, and a further line provided sidings for 22 wagons. On the down side was a refuge siding from under the bridge, which later became the down goods and also became a loop from the main line. However although it ran next to the platform, it was fenced off. The station buildings were constructed to designs by the architect John William Livock with a booking office built with brick for the front and side walls. The rest of it was timber which, over the years, became more and more dilapidated. The covered steps to the platforms were of corrugated iron. So it was not a pretty station and platform facilities were minimal, little more than a small waiting shelter on the down platform.
