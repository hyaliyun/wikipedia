Pseudogapping occurs in comparative and contrastive contexts, so it appears often after subordinators and coordinators such as if, although, but, than, etc. It is similar to verb phrase ellipsis (VP-ellipsis) insofar as the ellipsis is introduced by an auxiliary verb, and many grammarians take it to be a particular type of VP-ellipsis.See for instance Johnson (2001, 2009). The distribution of pseudogapping is more restricted than that of VP-ellipsis, however, and in this regard, it has some traits in common with gapping.For accounts of gapping, see for instance Ross (1970) and Jackendoff (1971). But unlike gapping (but like VP-ellipsis), pseudogapping occurs in English but not in closely related languages. The analysis of pseudogapping can vary greatly depending in part on whether the analysis is based in a phrase structure grammar or a dependency grammar. Pseudogapping was first identified, named, and explored by Stump (1977) and has since been studied in detail by Levin (1986) among others, and now enjoys a firm position in the canon of acknowledged ellipsis mechanisms of English.See for instance Jayaseelan (1990), Lasnik (1999), Baltin (2003), and Hoeksema (2006). Basic examples The following sentences are basic examples of VP-ellipsis and pseudogapping. Each pair draws attention to the similarities and differences across the two closely related ellipsis mechanisms. A smaller font and subscripts are used to mark the elided material, and the antecedent to the ellipsis is bolded: ::He drinks milk more often than she does drink milk. \\\\- VP-ellipsis ::He drinks milk more often than he does drink water. \\\\- Pseudogapping ::She is working today, but he isn't working today. \\\\- VP-ellipsis ::She is working today, and he is working tomorrow. \\\\- Pseudogapping ::Larry might read the short story, but I won't read the short story. \\\\- VP-ellipsis ::Larry might read the short story, but he won't read the play. \\\\- Pseudogapping The examples show that like VP-ellipsis, the ellipsis of pseudogapping is introduced by an auxiliary verb (be, can, could, have, may, might, should, will, would, etc.). The expression to the immediate right of the \\"pseudogap\\" is the remnant (water, tomorrow, the play). As with the remnants of gapping, the remnant of pseudogapping must stand in contrast to the parallel expression in the antecedent clause,See for instance Kuno (1976: 309) and Hudson (1989: 67). e.g. water must stand in contrast to milk in the first example. If it does not, the attempt at pseudogapping fails, e.g. :: *He drinks milk more often than she does drink milk. \\\\- Failed pseudogapping :: *She is working today, and he is working today also. \\\\- Failed pseudogapping :: *Larry might read the short story, but she won't read the short story. \\\\- Failed pseudogapping The star * indicates that the sentence is bad. These attempts at pseudogapping fail because the remnant does not stand in contrast to the parallel expression in the antecedent clause. Further examples The elided material of pseudogapping need not be continuous. In other words, there can be two gaps, e.g. ::She asks you to help more often than she does ask me to help. \\\\- Pseudogapping with discontinuous gap ::The teachers will require the boys to read, but they won't require the girls to read. \\\\- Pseudogapping with discontinuous gap ::The boss will assign you to work on Tuesday more readily than he will assign me to work on Wednesday. \\\\- Pseudogapping with discontinuous gap The last of these three examples is of particular interest, since it shows that pseudogapping can leave two remnants, instead of just one. The examples so far illustrate that pseudogapping is like gapping insofar as the remnants of both ellipsis mechanisms must stand in contrast to the parallel expressions in the antecedent clauses. Another aspect that aligns pseudogapping with gapping is that it must operate forwards; it cannot operate backwards, that is, the gap must follow its filler (= antecedent). This aspect of pseudogapping is unlike VP-ellipsis, which can operate both forwards and backwards, e.g. :: Although he won't consider your proposal, she will consider your proposal. \\\\- VP-ellipsis operating backward :: *Although he won't consider mine, he will consider your proposal. \\\\- Failed attempt at backward pseudogapping :: He will consider your proposal, although he won't consider mine. \\\\- Successful forward pseudogapping :: Although Susan does praise the cat, Fred never praises the cat. \\\\- VP-ellipsis operating backward :: *Although he never does praise the cat, Fred always praises the dog. \\\\- Failed attempt at backward pseudogapping :: Fred always praises the dog , although he never does praise the cat. \\\\- Successful forward pseudogapping Theoretical analyses Like many ellipsis mechanisms, pseudogapping challenges theories of syntax. One major difficulty concerns the syntactic status of the elided material. Under normal circumstances, this material often does not qualify as a constituent. Phrase structure grammars that posit the constituent as the fundamental unit of syntax must therefore seek some means of accounting for the fact that the elided material (= the pseudogapped material) does not appear to be a constituent. One widespread account of the phenomenon is to assume movement followed by ellipsis.See for instance Jayaseelan (1990) and Lasnik (1999). The remnant is moved out of the encompassing constituent, so that the encompassing constituent can then be elided. The following trees are representative of the movement plus ellipsis approach (the details will vary); they illustrate the second part of the sentence Phil tried to help you, but he didn't me: ::a movement analysis of pseudogapping A BPS-style (bare phrase structure) tree convention is employed here insofar as the words themselves are used to label the nodes in the tree. The tree on the left illustrates the underlying structure before movement and ellipsis, and the tree on the right shows the actual surface material. The object pronoun me is moved leftward out of the encompassing constituent try to help me, so that this constituent can then be elided - ellipsis here is indicated using the lighter font. Assuming movement first and ellipsis second in this manner, a constituent-based analysis of pseudogapping (and other ellipsis mechanisms) is possible, since the elided material can be viewed as a constituent after all. An alternative analysis takes the catena as the fundamental unit of syntactic analysis instead of the constituent.See Osborne et al. (2012). The catena is a unit of syntactic analysis that is closely associated with dependency grammars.Concerning dependency grammars, see the compilation of essays on dependency and valency theory in Ágel et al. (2003/6). Any word or any combination of words that is continuous in the vertical dimension with respect to dominance is a catena. In the example, the elided words qualify as a catena in surface syntax, which means movement is not necessary: ::catena analysis of pseudogapping The elided words in light gray qualify as a catena (but not a constituent). Thus if the catena is taken as the fundamental unit of syntactic analysis, the analysis of pseudogapping can remain entirely with what is present on the surface.

The document was Hungary's first permanent written constitution, and until its replacement in 2011, the country was the only former Eastern Bloc nation that did not adopt an entirely new constitution after the fall of Communism. The Constitution of Hungary, adopted in 2011, declares the 1949 constitution to be invalid. History =Adoption and amendments= First page of the 1949 constitution, as published in Magyar Közlöny Following the end of World War II and after the country had been occupied by the Soviet Union,Borhi, p.77-8 democratic elections were held under Statute VIII of 1945. Then, Statute I of 1946, a provisional constitutional statute (or \\"little constitution\\") passed on 31 January, formally ended the thousand-year monarchy and introduced a republican form of government.Körösényi, p.145 Then in 1949, after the Hungarian Working People's Party had assumed undisputed control of the country, the Communist-controlled parliament adopted a constitution as Act XX of 1949. The date of its adoption, 20 August, made a new national holiday that coincided with the traditional holiday of the feast of Saint Stephen. The document has been described as \\"a slavish imitation of the Soviet-type constitutions, with some variations resulting from the historical and political differences between the Soviet Union and Hungary\\". (Specifically, it was modelled on the \\"Stalin\\" 1936 Soviet Constitution.) Now, Hungary became a people's republic, which was \\"the state of the workers and working peasants\\".Ludwikowski, p.31 A Presidential Council elected by parliament was to be head of state, but real power rested with the Working People's Party, its leading role enshrined in the document. The National Assembly met for some ten days each year, with most rules taking the form of presidential and ministerial decrees. A variety of fundamental rights was guaranteed, but only for the working people (or in accordance with their interests). Moreover, no means existed of ensuring these rights' mandatory nature or of rendering them enforceable.Somody, p.211 Church and state were separated.Harmathy, p.7 Until 1989, the charter's basic features remained in effect, although the regime added important amendments in 1950, 1953, 1954, 1972, and 1983.\\"The Constitution of 1949\\", Library of Congress Country Studies Notably, Act I of 26 April 1972, comprehensively redrafted the constitution, proclaiming Hungary a socialist state. While the social, economic and political order remained the same, fundamental rights were now guaranteed for all citizens (but certain rights, like freedom of speech, press or assembly, still had to conform with the interests of socialism and the people). The preamble still paid tribute to the Soviet \\"liberators\\" but took a longer historical perspective, referring to the \\"millennium\\" of the people's struggle. The role of mass movements and trade unions (in addition to the party) in the building of socialism was acknowledged, the equal ranking of state and cooperative ownership asserted, and private producers recognised, so long as they did not \\"violate collective interests\\".Rakowska-Harmstone, p.100 As a moderate liberalisation continued to set in during the ensuing years, Act II of 1983 set up a Constitutional Council, intending to watch over the constitutionality of legal rules by giving internal review; and Act X of 1987 limited the Presidential Council's authority to issue law-decrees. Reforms were accelerated in 1989, with Act I envisaging the establishment of a Constitutional Court and lifting political restrictions on the exercise of all fundamental rights, and Act VIII introducing the motion of no confidence vis- à-vis the Council of Ministers and its members.Harmathy, p.7-8 =1989 reforms= From 1988 on, as the economic situation deteriorated and opposition groups emerged, the idea of preparing a new constitution emerged. Reform Communists and the opposition took account of this development at the Hungarian Round Table Talks in mid-1989, desiring a document that would establish a multiparty system, parliamentary democracy and a social market economy. However, time constraints did not allow a completely new constitution to be written. On 18 October, the National Assembly approved a comprehensive amendment package which allowed the 1949 Constitution to prevail until a new constitution was framed. The reform (Act XXXI of 1989), changed nearly 100 provisions of the 1949 Constitution, and pruned out its Communist character. It was the first thoroughgoing constitutional transformation in the Soviet bloc. It was adopted like a normal constitutional amendment, and was passed by a margin of 333-5 (with eight abstentions)–well above the required two-thirds majority. The amended constitution went into effect on 23 October, the anniversary of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956.Harmathy, p.8-9 The 1989 reform established Hungary as an independent, democratic, constitutional republic that was both civil democratic and democratic socialist. The economy was to be a social market one, with planning employed and public and private property enjoying equal protection. The people were sovereign, with parties functioning freely. Among the new features introduced were a weak presidency and strong parliament with oversight powers, checks and balances, limitations on the authority of the prime minister, provisions for referendums, and an independent judiciary. Outside the preamble, all references to \\"socialism\\" were carefully deleted. The Constitutional Court, whose members are elected by two-thirds of parliament, can annul laws declared unconstitutional, and has broad jurisdiction. The parliamentary term was reduced from five to four years. Human rights were emphasized, with reference to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The changes were all-encompassing: it was said, with some exaggeration, that the only provision that remained untouched named Budapest as the capital.Mullerson, p.83 However, the form of the state was not changed; it was still described as a parliamentary democracy with parliament as \\"a supreme organ of state power and popular representation\\" that retained the power to elect the highest executive and judicial officers of the state.Ludwikowski, p.180-81 Andrew Arato, an expert on constitutions in new democracies, places the 1989 text under his \\"post-sovereign\\" constitution making paradigm, so called because no single body with full powers is tasked with drafting a new constitution. Rather, the model involves a body such as a round table of major political forces drafting an interim constitution, followed by a freely elected one composing a final draft. Aside from Poland and Hungary, this method was used several years later to create the Constitution of South Africa. In Hungary, the preamble of the 1989 modification referred to its temporary character,Ludwikowski, p.110 a fact recalled when it was finally replaced by an entirely new constitution over two decades later.Zoltán Csipke, \\"Hungary's punditocracy weighs in on new constitution\\", politics.hu, 20 April 2011; accessed April 28, 2011 =Developments from 1990 to 2010= After 1989, the constitution was amended multiple times. The first changes came in 1990 when, after free elections brought the opposition to power, references to democratic socialism and the planned economy were dropped. (When these had been included half a year earlier, the Communists were thought to be much more popular than these elections would show).Harmathy, p.9 Also that year, a pact between the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF), who had won the elections, and the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), who came in second, resulted in additional changes. The President was to be elected by the Parliament rather than directly; the constructive vote of no confidence was introduced; and areas in which a two- thirds majority was required to adopt a law were reduced, making governing easier. In exchange for agreeing to this set of MDF proposals, Árpád Göncz of the SZDSZ was elected President. \\"Nagyító alatt: az MDF-SZDSZ paktum\\" (\\"In Focus: MDF-SZDSZ Pact\\"), HírExtra, 28 April 2011; accessed June 23, 2011 In 1994, the list of issues to be decided by parliament with a ⅔ majority was shortened, and the Constitutional Court was shrunk from 15 to 11 judges. In 1995, when the possibility of completing the democratic transition via a new constitution arose, an amendment was adopted requiring four-fifths of Parliament to agree to the drafting rules. This enhanced supermajority provision was meant to ensure that the replacement constitution would enjoy broad acceptance.Miklós Bánkuti, Gábor Halmai and Kim Lane Scheppele, \\"From Separation of Powers to a Government without Checks: Hungary's Old and New Constitutions\\", in Tóth, p.249 In 1997 an amendment streamlined the judicial system, while later modifications allowed Hungary to join the European Union.The Ratification Process in Hungary In late 2010, even as a new constitution was being prepared, an amendment was passed restricting the powers of the Constitutional Court on budget-related laws.\\"Parliament approves amendment on constitutional changes\\", politics.hu, 11 November 2010; accessed April 26, 2011. Prior to its replacement, the document included a preamble and was divided into fifteen chapters with 79 articles.Text of the Constitution In the mid-1990s, Prime Minister Gyula Horn unsuccessfully tried to enact a new constitution. In 2006, during Ferenc Gyurcsány's premiership, a new charter was drafted for internal use which mentioned the Holy Crown of Hungary and placed the Chief Prosecutor of Hungary under government control; its contents were not made public until the 2011 debate on a new constitution. \\"Magyarázkodásra kényszerül Gyurcsány\\" (\\"Gyurcsány Is Forced to Explain\\"), Magyar Nemzet, 4 April 2011; accessed April 25, 2011. When a new constitution was ultimately adopted that year, it included the provision that Hungarians \\"do not recognize the communist constitution of 1949, since it was the basis for tyrannical rule\\". Thus, the 1949 document, including the changes made in 1989 and afterward, was explicitly rejected.Oliver W. Lembcke and Christian Boulanger, \\"Between Revolution and Constitution: The Roles of the Hungarian Constitutional Court\\", in Tóth, p.285 At first, as the only Communist-era constitution retained in Eastern Europe,Szikinger, p.406 Hungary's charter and by extension its political system did not command a great deal of respect. The fact that it was preserved reflected a tradition of gradualism in Hungarian constitutional history; there was no constitutional assembly or referendum to confer additional legitimacy on the new system. And in particular, the enthusiastic Constitutional Court seemed more intent on applying German case law than the Hungarian constitution. However, it gained stature from the early 1990s for three reasons. First, the process of gradual amendments allowed for experimentation that remedied some of its weaknesses. Second, the 1989 document became stable in 1997 when the government abandoned plans for drafting a new constitution. Finally, the Court never disregarded the constitution altogether, remaining acutely aware of its text.Dupré, p.173-4 Footnotes The document was initially titled Constitution of the Hungarian People's Republic (). The document was thenceforth titled Constitution of the Republic of Hungary (A Magyar Köztársaság Alkotmánya). Notes References * Borhi, László.

Signal troops were stationed in the country from 1923 to 1979.  Formation of the Malta Signal Section  In 1923 the Malta Signal Section was formed. It was staffed by Maltese civilian and British army personnel.  Expansion in World War Two  The section expanded in World War Two and in 1940 was renamed Malta Command Signals. The Signals Liaison Unit intercepted German and Italian communications in the Mediterranean. They were equipped with an RAF Type X machine and so were able to send encoded relays to Britain. Operations were initially conducted from under the Barrakka, until a combined services headquarters known as the Lascaris War Rooms could be excavated on the site of a garden built during the reign of Grand Master Jean Lascaris (1656–1670). Access to the war rooms was gained through a tunnel located in the Valletta main ditch at the foot of St Peter and St Paul bastion or from the side of Fort Lascaris. This facility started operations early in 1943 in time for them to be used during Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily. Lascaris was furnished with a Filter Room, Gun Operations Room and Fighter Control Room. There were dedicated chambers to accommodate signals intelligence and also the Royal Observer Corps which had started operating from Malta late in 1942.  Post war developments  In 1947 the unit was renamed the Malta Signal Squadron. In 1949 the first locally enlisted military personnel joined the unit. In late 1954, in Mtarfa Malta, the Malta COMCAN Signal Squadron joined the 234 Signal Quadron and in 1959 they were renamed 235 Signal Squadron (COMCAN). It was one of the regular post-war units in the Royal Corps of Signals and had direct links to Boddington and Episkopi in Cyprus. The squadron ran a major tape-relay station for COMCAN which consisted of a tape-relay centre at Fort Bingemma, a transmitter station at Fort Zonqor and a receiver at Ta' Wied Rini. In July 1967 the subtitle \\"DCN\\" replaced \\"COMCAN\\" to become 235 Signal Squadron (DCN) which referred to both the Commonwealth Communications Army Network (COMCAN) and the area of responsibility as Malta and Libya. Two years later the unit was officially disbanded on 1 March 1969. 234 and 235 Signal Squadrons were later reformed as distinct units of 9 Signal Regiment part of the Joint Signals Support Unit based in Cyprus. 234 Squadron provided communication services for the three services in Malta, as well as headquarters in Malta and Libya, until disbanded on 1 April 1979.

Stavros, later moved to Vienna in order to take over the commercial business of his father, while studying at the local business school. Because of his profession he had to travel in various European cities. In Saint Petersburg, he met Ioannis Kapodistrias, that time a diplomat in the service of the Russian Empire, that would play a key role in the Greek politics the following years. Stavros soon became a member of the patriotic organization Filiki Eteria. Greek War of Independence Shortly after the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence (1821) he supported the uprising by supplying the revolutionaries with firearms, ammunition and food. In 1824 Stavros moved to Greece and the next year he was appointed Chief Cashier of the Executive body of the First Hellenic Republic, under Georgios Kountouriotis. Apart from his financial duties, he joined the armed struggle against the Ottoman Empire by leading an infantry group against Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt. He held the rank of Chiliarchos and was in charge of 50 men in central Greece, in order to support the defenders of Missolonghi during its Third Siege. Stavros participated in the Third National Assembly at Troezen (1827) as representative of the regions of Epirus and Central Greece, as well as in the Fifth National Assembly at Nafplion (1831), as representative of Epirus. After Independence and restoration of the Greek economy Georgios Stavros on the 1926 Greek 10 drachma banknote During Kapodistrias' premiership (1828–1831), he participated in the three-member Economic Committee that was responsible for the operation of the first state bank of Greece, the National Financial Bank (), which issued money, the Phoenix, and securities. After the assassination of Kapodistrias, Greece came under the rule of King Otto. During this period Stavros, became a key figure in the establishment of the National Bank of Greece and was its first governor, elected in 1842. The National Bank of Greece was the sole institution that would issue banknotes in Greece (Drachmas) for the next 87 years. Until his death, Stavros laid the foundations for the organization and expansion of the Bank, due to experience gained from his business in Vienna as well as the guidance offered by the Swiss banker, Jean-Gabriel Eynard. Stavros remained in this post until his death in 1869. At his own expense, Stavros established an orphanage in his home town of Ioannina. His portrait is displayed on various pre-1932 Greek banknotes.

Its last assignment was with Air Defense Command (ADC) at Santa Monica, California, where it was discontinued in 1961. The wing was organized in 1955 to ensure that the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) air defense system, was compatible with ADC's operational requirements. It also performed operational testing and training on SAGE and earlier systems. Once SAGE started to become operational, the need for the wing no longer existed and it was discontinued, although one of its subordinate groups continued the SAGE training mission until 1962. History The 4620th Air Defense Wing was established to implement the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) air defense system, a system of analog computer-equipped direction centers that could process information from ground radars, picket ships and ground observers onto a generated radar scope to create a composite picture of the emerging air battle.Winkler & Webster, p. 32 The wing was responsible to ensure that SAGE computer systems were based on approved operational concepts for air defense and provided guidance to operational units concerning the implementation, installation, testing, and utilization of SAGE computer programs. Until December 1958, the wing also provided training on the existing manual air defense control systems that were being replaced by SAGE. The 4620th was originally located with MIT's Lincoln Laboratories, which had developed the SAGE system,Winkler & Webster, p. 89 to permit close coordination with the organization developing SAGE.Cornett & Johnson, p. 65 In 1957, the 4620th Air Defense Group was organized at Richards-Gebaur Air Force Base, Missouri to manage programming and training for the SAGE system and was assigned to the wing.Cornett & Johnson, p. 87 The wing moved to Santa Monica, California in 1958. Anticipating the wing move to Santa Monica, the 4620th Group was reassigned directly to ADC. On 15 September, the 4620th group was renumbered as the 4606th Air Defense Group, and continued with that designation until discontinued on 25 June 1962. The wing prepared the operational employment plan for integration of IM-99 Bomarc surface-to-air missiles into the SAGE system. Preceded by extensive planning and testing of almost three years, the first SAGE air defense sector (New York) became operational on 26 June 1958.Leonard, p. 311 The first SAGE division (New York) became operational on 1 January 1959.Leonard, p. 312 As the SAGE system was becoming fully operational in 1961,Cornett & Johnson, p. 34 the 4620th Wing had completed its mission and was discontinued.

It consists of approximately 25 originally two-up, two-down brick terraces, built for housing railway and colliery workers at the turn of the 20th century, which have mostly been extended. Hagg Bank is located on a bend in the river, so faces east, rather than north. It is popular spot for salmon fishing, walking and cycling as it is on the National Cycle Route 72. Hagg Bank Hill is a notorious one for walkers, runners and cyclists alike to ascend, and there is no footpath in several areas making it difficult to walk on for those accessing the road towards West Wylam. At the crest of the hill is West Wylam Allotments, which provides views of the dramatic Tyne Valley and even the urbanised areas of Newburn, Ryton and Newcastle on a sunny day. The bottom of the hill accesses the Tyne Riverside Country Park, a popular place for activities and leisure, as well as Wylam Railway Bridge (also known as Points Bridge) which eventually reaches the village of Wylam downstream on the Tyne and Wear border. http://www.cycle- routes.org/hadrianscycleway/crossings/hagg_bank.html Hagg Bank and the surrounding land were originally the deer park for Prudhoe Castle.http://www.keystothepast.info/durhamcc/K2P.nsf/K2PDetail?readform&PRN;=N13804 References Category:Geography of Northumberland ","title":"Hagg Bank"},{"id":"34461483","title":"1994 Macedonian general election"},{"id":"34461501","text":"Azeez Issa Adesiji is the chairman of the Ilesa West local government area in Osun State, southwest Nigeria.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed 2012-02-11 stream located in San Mateo County, California in the United States. It is part of the San Francisquito Creek watershed. History Detail from 1857 Plat of Rancho El Corte de Madera The creek flowed through the hamlet of Searsville The creek's name is Spanish for \\"still,\\" referring to a liquor distillery. Older Spanish spells it alembique with an \\"e\\". The English spelling is alembic, a type of still that is used today. The e spelling dominates in the 1800s and continued on most maps until the 1930s. The name refers to moonshiners Tom Bowen and Nicholas Dawson, English seaman deserters, who built an illegal still on the creek in 1842. The creek runs through Wunderlich Park in Woodside, California, where, in 1904, the creek was used by J. A. Folger for the first hydro-electrical power system in the region. Watershed Alambique Creek begins below Skyline Boulevard on Bear Gulch Road near the intersection with Bear Glen Drive. After crossing La Honda Road, and just south of the intersection of Mountain Home Road and Portola Road, Alambique Creek enters a historic wetland pond (Lloyd's Pond) which is currently impounded by the road-fill of Portola Road and a culvert. Next, Alambique Creek flows under Portola Road into the upper Searsville Reservoir at its confluence with Sausal Creek. Ecology Alambique Creek was once a historical steelhead trout (coastal rainbow trout) (Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus) spawning stream. In 1981, the creek was fish sampled and two stream resident rainbow trout which have been isolated from the Bay by Searsville Dam were collected where the creek crosses La Honda Road. In May 2002, the culvert beneath Highway 84 was identified as an impassable barrier to upstream migration.

A first trailer was released in 2011. It was reported in the media that it presents Mark Hamill's first appearance in a British film; however, Hamill had acted previously in the 1982 British film Britannia Hospital. Airborne's introduction, before sporting a voice-over by Mark Hamill, refers in writing to a so-called Firelight Protocol. Plot Despite an approaching winter storm a near-empty airliner takes off from London for New York. One by one the passengers begin to disappear, while one passenger who frequents the route notices the plane has turned whereas it should be flying straight. Soon it is discovered that the pilots are dead and that the plane is on autopilot; and it is revealed that two on board are hijackers who have murdered the pilots to take control of the plane. The passengers who disappeared were killed when they witnessed parts of the hijacking. The hijackers intend to steal and sell both the plane and an ancient vase being transported on board which, according to legend, acts as a prison for a death god. The passengers try to hinder the hijackers but they are unable to overpower them and instead wind up tied to the seats of the plane, the hijackers planning to use them as hostages. Meanwhile, air traffic control becomes alarmed; they have lost radio contact with the plane as it first veers off course and then disappears from radar. They alert the authorities, who assume the plane has been taken over by terrorists and send fighter aircraft to intercept it. As fighter planes take off and close in on the airliner the would-be hostages escape their bonds. The people on the hijacked airliner begin to go violently crazy, killing themselves and each other without apparent reason; the incorporeal death god has been released from the vase and is possessing people, trying to find a suitable host. The airliner passes into South American airspace, causing the fighter jets to give up pursuit; then the air controllers watch in horror as the plane begins to descend, its trajectory sending it into the ocean. One of the passengers has disabled the autopilot and is flying the plane into the ocean to prevent the death god from being released into the world. A passenger possessed by the death god and one of the hijackers try to stop the plane from crashing, but they fail; the death god leaves the passenger's body at the last moment, giving her only enough time to scream into the radio before the plane hits the water. Back in London, the air traffic controllers are marched out of the control room by the authorities, who mean to leave no witnesses. The eyes of one of the controllers flash blue, indicating that he is possessed by the death god.

Chasing Indians, cattle rustlers and escorting officials were the main duties during this period. The soldiers were part of the Presidio San Antonio de Bexar, who were housed in the Alamo fort in late 1835.

Although a skirmish occurred, talks were made between the two sides.

The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on January 26, 2012. Guest stars in this episode include Emma Stone, Ken Howard, Mick Foley, Andy Samberg, and the Philadelphia Phillies mascot the Phillie Phanatic. Steve Earle sings a ballad about Kenneth Parcell in the closing credits. In the episode, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) and Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) fall out as a result of Jenna's selfish behavior since her role on America's Kidz Got Singing, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) eliminates the page program to impress Hank Hooper (Ken Howard) but comes to suffer the consequences, whilst Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) contemplates his own mortality after a misunderstanding results in him receiving no birthday presents. Plot As a result of her role on America's Kidz Got Singing, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) has become a more widely known celebrity and is starring in the new holiday movie Martin Luther King Day. Soon, she begins to let the fame go to her head and uses her best friend Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) as a decoy when leaving a restaurant, tricking her into having paint thrown over her by PETA protestors on her behalf. This leads the pair to fall out and go in search of new best friends, with Jenna hanging out with D-list celebrities, such as Charlie from Charlie Bit My Finger and Liz stumbling across her doppelgänger in a Barnes & Noble bathroom. Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) eliminates the page program to impress Hank Hooper (Ken Howard), since all the jobs that the pages do can be done electronically to save money. Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) argues against this, but Jack still goes though with his plan, even naming the new computer \\"NotKenneth.\\" However, Jack's plan backfires when a one-year \\"businessversery\\" present to Hank is sent to TGS by accident, due to him having accidentally instructed the computer to deliver to the \\"6th floor\\" instead of the \\"60th floor\\". Finally, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) discovers that he won't be receiving any birthday presents due to a misunderstanding, but when Grizz (Grizz Chapman) and Dot Com (Kevin Brown) inform him that he already has most things anyway, he starts to contemplate his own mortality. Ultimately, Liz comes to realise that she needs Jenna because she is too self-absorbed to complain when she talks about her problems, whilst Jenna realizes that all of her D-list friends are themselves too self-absorbed to pay her any attention. Jack acknowledges then he needs Kenneth and the other pages because he is able to blame all of his mistakes on them, while Tracy realizes that he was simply annoyed with Grizz and Dot Com for not buying him any presents. During the closing credits, folk singer Steve Earle sings a ballad about the rise of Kenneth from farm boy to page. Reception Jane Krakowski filming the episode in New York City on October 28, 2011 According to the Nielsen Media Research, this episode of 30 Rock was watched by 3.98 million households in its original American broadcast.

Arsuf-Appolonia. Excavations have yielded remains from the Middle Bronze Age to the Early Arab period. Description The archaeological site of Tel Michal covers five hills on the ridge running along the coast, which are composed of lithified wind-blown sediments, an eolianite known locally as kurkar. The highest of these, the actual tell, stands 30m above sea level and is three quarters of an acre in size. It is separated from the other hills by two ravines running to the sea on its north and south. To its north stands another hill, 5 meters lower in altitude. This hill is a rectangular plateau, 250 x 175 meters, bordered on its north by the Gelilot Stream. Three hillocks lie to the northeast, east and southeast of the high mound. The northeastern hillock covers an area of some 2000 m2. The two remaining hillocks are smaller and rise to a height of 5 meters. History =Bronze Age= Stratum XVII of the excavations of Tel Michal reveals that the site was first settled at the end of the Middle Bronze Age IIB (1800/1750–1550 BCE). The first settlers built a 4-m-high raised platform made of alternating layers of red clay and sand on the tel's high mound. This was supported by a brick retaining wall on the north and a glacis made of sloping layers of sand. Structures were then built on top of the platform, though none were preserved. The site covered approximately one-half to three quarters of an acre at the time, finds from which included local pottery, Cypriot imports, Hyksos scarabs and Egyptian alabaster vessels. It was likely a trading post connected to the Hyksos dynasties that dominated Egypt. This initial settlement was apparently destroyed by tectonic activity. Settlers who arrived at Tel Michal during the Late Bronze Age I (1550–1400 BCE) expanded the area of the high mound by means of a 10m high, 30m wide earth fill, determining its shape to this day. During this period in the site's habitation, a small fort, commanding the approach from the coast to the ridge, was constructed on the north side of the mound. The strip of sand below the fort would have been an ideal location for traders to anchor or beach their ships. Several dwellings stood south of the fort. Finds from the period include local pottery and Cypriot imports, plus an unusual group of kraters, different from the typical pottery of the period. Possibly the product of the Palestinian or Syrian coast, these were made of coarse material and decorated with horizontal bands or wavy lines in black or black and red, while two displayed horizontal handles. The Late Bronze Age I settlement at Tel Michal was also destroyed, though less violently than its predecessor. It was resettled during the Late Bronze Age II (1400–1200 BCE). Although the new inhabitants expanded the earlier rampart and added a retaining wall at its base, the site remained largely unchanged until the 14th or early 13th centuries BCE when it was again abandoned, perhaps as the result of a decline in international commerce. =Iron Age= Tel Michal remained uninhabited until the 10th century BCE, when the high mound and the three hillocks were settled. Strata XIV and XIII display typical Iron Age dwellings, plus a walled, 10m by 10m open-air cultic structure on the northeastern hillock, a room devoted to cult on the eastern one, and two rectangular structures with benches along the walls on the southeastern hillock. The room on the eastern hillock featured a square eolianite base that may have served as an altar or an offering table, while four chalices and additional vessels were recovered nearby. It appears all three hillocks served as family cultic rooms, the biblical bamot, suggesting a Phoenician population. East of the high mound excavators also found two pairs of long wine presses. The site was once again abandoned in the 10th century and resettled and abandoned once more during the 8th. =Persian period= Tel Michal features six strata (XI-VI) from the Persian period, a testament to the importance of the region to both Phoenician trade and the Persian army. Stratum XI, dated to the late 6th century BCE and early 5th, shows the site was again serving as a way station and trading post. Pottery from the period is characterized by geometric and floral motifs of the East Greek style. On the northern edge of the high mound excavators uncovered a fort, while the rest of the mound features multiple silos, cooking ovens and ash pits. These would suggest that the site was home to a garrison, probably charged with guarding the food stores. Though they would change in character in subsequent phases, structures on the northern edge of the mound would continue to serve as military and administrative headquarters throughout the Persian period. Houses on the southern mound in stratum X (first half of the 5th century BCE) are the first evidence of a permanent settlement. This settlement reached its zenith towards the end of this century and the next, when it covered an area of 1.5 to 2.5 acres. The site also shows evidence of town planning absent in previous phases. A temple stood on the northern hillock, from which dozens of votive figurines were recovered, while another stood on the eastern hillock. Houses on the northern hill are bordered by an industrial quarter featuring several kilns, while two wine presses stood nearby. By the final phase of the Persian period, the high mound also displays a functional division, with its northern edge occupied by a fort, the center by dwellings, and the southern part mostly empty save for a number of silos. The northern hill also contained a cemetery, a section from which, covering no more than a tenth of its estimated area, yielded 120 burials. These were found to be of three distinct types, cist burials, pit graves and infant burials in storage jars. Burial offering were also recovered, including bowls, fibulae, bronze bracelets, iron tools and silver rings. Ze'ev Harzog noted the striking resemblance of this assemblage to similar finds from Kamid el-Loz in Lebanon, also dated to the 4th century BCE. =Hellenistic period= Deep excavation to determine strata and extent of suspected fortification The settlement at Tel Michal was not destroyed during the region's conquest by Alexander the Great, ushering the Hellenistic period, though it appears to have been abandoned by the end of the 4th century BCE. Settlement was renewed shortly thereafter, but was completely different in character. The high mound was dominated by a large fortress, 20 by 25 meters, with a central courtyard. Nearby, excavations uncovered a number of houses and a kiln. The northern hill was not resettled, housing a large wine press instead. The installation contained two collection vats, the larger of which had a capacity of 7,000 liters, suggesting a communal role. The northeastern hillock continued to serve a cultic purpose, housing a courtyard containing an altar, while the eastern hillock housed a round silo. A hoard of 47 silver tetradrachms found near the silo contains coins from the reigns of Ptolemy I through Ptolemy III, dating stratum V to the third century BCE. Stratum IV, uncovered on the high mound, testifies to habitation during Seleucid rule over the region (second century BCE). Seleucid control of the site probably ended with John Hyrcanus' (r. 134-104 BCE) conquest of Jaffa. Tel Michal was also occupied during the Hasmonean period. A small fort stood at the center of the high mound, and a small wine press stood 500 meters south of it. Both produced coins from the reign of Alexander Jannaeus. Tel Michal was probably a part of the defensive line of fortifications established by Jannaeus along the Yarkon river, described by Josephus.Josephus, The Wars of the Jews 1:100Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews 13:389–391 =Roman period= View south from Tel Michal, showing Tel Aviv A large fortress, 31 by 38 meters, once again stood at the site during the Roman period. Erected on foundations of coarse eolianite, the superstructure was built of dressed eolianite stones laid in headers. The entrance to the fortress stood on its northern side, while in the center of its inner courtyard stood a tower which may have served as a lighthouse at night. Coins recovered at the site come from the reign of prefects Marcus Ambibulus, Valerius Gratus, Pontius Pilate and King Agrippa I, dating the fortress to 10 – 50 CE. The only fortress of its kind found along Israel's Mediterranean coast, it served as a base and anchorage for the Roman army. Its remains are the most prominent feature of present-day Tel Michal. =Early Arab period= Initial deep excavation extended to the edge of the tell to verify the extent of fortification levels, visible on left side of the trench as darker layers separated by sand The final phase of habitation at Tel Michal, stratum I, features a small watchtower built on top of the high mound. Sherds of Khirbat al-Mafjar ware and plaster decorated with geometric designs date the tower to the Abbasid period. By the late Roman period, Tel Michal had been eclipsed by the nearby city of Apollonia, and a gap of 700 years formed between the Roman layer and the site's final phase, dated to 8th and 9th centuries CE. Built on a foundation of concrete and stone blocks, the tower was probably part of an early warning network against enemy ships mentioned by Arab geographer Al-Muqaddasi. Research history Tel Michal was first surveyed by Jacob Ory, an inspector for the British Mandate Department of Antiquities, in 1922. Ory noted that the surrounding area appears on Survey of Western Palestine maps as \\"Khirbet Makmish\\". Suspecting the site to be connected to nearby Apollonia, Ory relied on a bilingual inscription from Cyprus identifying Apollo-Amyklos with Reshef-Mekal and proposed that the ancient name of the site had been Amyklos-Mekal. The suffix \\"ish\\" was later added to Mekal, which was then distorted from Mekalish to Makmish. In 1959, the Israeli Government Names Committee accordingly named it Tel Michal, although no etymological connection between Mekal and the Hebrew name Michal has been established. The site was again excavated by Ory in 1940 and by R.W. Hamilton in 1944. Between 1958 and 1960, archaeologist Nahman Avigad conducted a salvage excavation at the northern hill on behalf of the Eretz Israel Museum and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Tel Michal was excavated again during four seasons from 1977 to 1980 under Ze'ev Herzog and James Muhly, as part of a regional project to explore the western Yarkon River basin. Besides the Institute of Archaeology at Tel Aviv, participating institutions included the University of Minnesota Duluth, Brigham Young University, the University of Pennsylvania, the Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary, Hamline University, the Central Michigan University and Macquarie University of North Ryde, Australia. Zeev Herzog conducted another salvage excavation at the site in 1982 after tractors uncovered remains of plastered structures east of the high mound, revealing four Iron Age wine presses. =1979/80 Seasons= Campsite and pottery sorting tables, 1979 Staff and students were housed in tents in a secure compound about 4km north of Tel Michal. Excavation work continued from about 6am to 2pm. Pottery of the day was sorted in the evening. Grain grinding stone, Persian period strata The hole was a standard 10' x 10' grid and was excavated to a depth of around 7 meters. At around 4 meters the sand changed to earthworks. Further excavation indicated that several construction levels were present, as seen by the colour changes in the strata. The hole was later extended into a trench using a bulldozer, which verified at least two distinct platforms from different periods.

Biography and musical career  Son of Felice Filippini (painter, writer and broadcaster) and of the pianist Dafne Salati, Rocco Filippini began his musical training at an early age. Of decisive importance was his meeting with Pierre Fournier who became his teacher along with Professor Franz Walter of the Geneva Conservatory. It was from the Geneva Conservatory that Rocco Filippini received his diploma at the age of 17, being awarded the Premier Prix de Virtuosité, an accolade not given for the previous 36 years. He continued to perfect his playing with his teachers, who came to include the violinist Corrado Romano. At the age of 23 he won the Geneva International Music Competition and embarked on his performing career. With a wide musical repertory, from Baroque to contemporary works, Rocco Filippini has played in the main concert halls of Europe, North and South America, Australia and Japan, and at numerous well-known festivals. In 1968 with Bruno Canino and Cesare Ferraresi he founded the Trio di Milano, which was subsequently joined by the violinist Mariana Sîrbu. He was a founder member In 1992 of the Quartetto Accardo. He has performed in numerous concerts at the La Scala theatre in Milan, where he has played in recitals with cello and piano, performed the György Ligeti concerto with the Scala Philarmonic Orchestra, and taken part in many chamber music concerts, often in association with Maurizio Pollini, with whom he has performed concert programmes for several years in Rome, London, Tokyo and New York, and at the Rossini Opera Festival in Pesaro and Salzburg festivals. At the Salzburg Festival in 2002 he premièred Fabio Vacchi’s Tre Veglie, with Anna Caterina Antonacci, accompanied by the Orchestre de Paris conducted by Ivan Fischer. In 1979 he was appointed as cello teacher at the Giuseppe Verdi Conservatory in Milan. In 2003 he was invited by Luciano Berio to hold the chair of specialisation courses at the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome. In 1985, together with Salvatore Accardo, Bruno Giuranna and Franco Petracchi, he founded the Walter Stauffer Academy in Cremona. Since its inception, the academy for players of stringed instruments has attracted over eight hundred young people from many different countries, and was awarded the Franco Abbiati Music Critics prize in 2000. Rocco Filippini was repeatedly invited by Rudolf Serkin to the Marlboro Music Festival and to the Music from Marlboro concert series. Some of today’s leading composers have dedicated works to him: Franco Donatoni, Ala; Luciano Berio, Elaborazione per violoncello e contrabbasso based on his duets for two violins; Giovanni Sollima, The Songlines; Salvatore Sciarrino, Il paese senz'alba. Rocco Filippini performed the première of Salvatore Sciarrino’s Trio no. 2 at the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam in 1987, and in 2003 he conducted Sciarrino’s Cadenzario performed by the Giuseppe Verdi Orchestra of Milan. Rocco Filippini has edited works from the cello repertory for Ricordi: Bach Suites, Popper 40 Studies op. 73, Servais 6 Caprices op. 11 and Piatti 12 Caprices op.25 and has published arrangements of Wagner’s Wesendonck Lieder and De Falla’s Siete Canciones Populares Españolas. His many recordings include discs for RCA, Fonè, Nuova Era, Assai, Fonit Cetra Italia, Amadeus, Ricordi, Symphonia, Dynamic, etc. He plays the Gore Booth Stradivarius (1710).

It took place on December 25, 2011, at Arena Naucalpan in Naucalpan, State of Mexico, IWRG's main venue. The event featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds or storylines. Five of the six matches had a championship on the line, including the main event where La Parka and Octagón defended the Mexican National Tag Team Championship against Chessman and Silver Cain in a steel cage match. That match marked the first time in several years that the Mexican National Tag Team Championship had been defended. The show also featured title defenses from other wrestling promotions such as Xtreme Mexican Wrestling (XMW Mixed Tag Team Championship) and Desastre Total Ultraviolento (DTU Extreme Championship) in addition to the IWRG promoted IWRG Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship and Distrito Federal Trios Championship. Production =Background= Professional wrestling has a long running tradition of holding shows that feature several championship matches, and at times actually promotes shows as an \\"all championship matches\\" show. The earliest documented \\"All-Championship\\" show is the EMLL Carnaval de Campeones (\\"Carnival of Champions\\") held on January 13, 1965. In 2007 WWE held a pay- per-view called Vengeance: Night of Champions, making WWE Night of Champions a recurring theme. Starting in 2008 the Mexican lucha libre promotion International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG) has held a regular major show labeled Caravana de Campeones, Spanish for \\"Caravan of Champions\\" using the same concept for a major annual show. In 2011 IWRG joined together with Dr. Wagner Jr.'s Promociones Wagner to present Guerra de Campeones (\\"War of the Champions\\"), featuring champions representing a number of different promotions, not just IWRG. =Storylines= The event featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers, where some were involved in pre-existing scripted feuds or storylines and others simply put together by the matchmakers without a backstory. Being a professional wrestling event matches are not won legitimately through athletic competition; they are instead won via predetermined outcomes to the matches that are kept secret from the general public. Wrestlers portrayed either heels (the bad guys, referred to as Rudos in Mexico) or faces (fan favorites or Técnicos in Mexico). For the Guerra de Campeones show IWRG and Promociones Wagner invited the Xtreme Mexican Wrestling's Mixed Tag Team Champions Ojo Diabolico, Jr. and Ludark Shaitan to compete and defend the championship on their show against the mixed-gender team of Dement Xtreme and Sexy Lady (Ludark Shaitan cousin). Ojo Diabloico Jr. and Ludark had won the mixed tag team championship on September 1, 2011, from their now-challengers Dement Xtreme and Sexy Lady. This would be their first defense of the championship. On April 29, 2010 the trio known as Los Gringos VIP (Avisman, El Hijo del Diablo and Gringo Loco) won the Distrito Federal Trios Championship by defeating the team of Máscara Año 2000, Máscara Año 2000 Jr. and El Hijo de Máscara Año 2000 in the finals of a tournament for the vacant championship. Initially it looked like the Máscara Año 2000 trio team had won the match and the championship, but Lucha Libre AAA World Wide (AAA) wrestler Silver King, who was watching from the front row, informed the referee that the team had used an illegal move to win the match, thus reversing the decision, making Los Gringos VIP the Distrito Federal Trios Champions instead. The appearance of Silver King started a long running story-line rivalry between IWRG and AAA, including the Guerra de Campeones show. Los Gringos VIP defended the championship on several occasions in 2010, including victories over trios such as Los Terribles Cerebros (Black Terry, Cerebro Negro and Dr. Cerebro) twice and Mike Segura teaming up with Trauma I and Trauma II. In 2011 the title was inactive as Gringo Loco returned to the US and did not work for IWRG on a regular basis, leaving the fate of the Distrito Federal Trios Championship in limbo. In late November IWRG announced that the Distrito Federal Trios Championship would be defended by Avisman, El Hijo del Diablo and Apolo Estrada Jr., allowing Estrada to take over from Gringo Loco.The poster officially lists Apolo Estrada Jr. as one of the champions. Another promotion that IWRG and Promotiones Wagner reached out to was Desastre Total Ultraviolento (DTU), a Mexican Hardcore wrestling promotion. For the show DTU send their DTU Extreme Champion Joe Líder to IWRG to defend the championship against Súper Mega, Último Gladiador and Violento Jack in a Four-Way no-disqualification elimination Match. Líder had won the championship on December 18, 2010 when he defeated Zumbi on a DTU show in Tlalnepantla, Mexico State. Líder had previously defended the DTU Extreme Championship against IWRG mainstay Dr. Cerebro on an IWRG show. The second IWRG championship to be defended on the Guerra de Campeones show was the IWRG Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship. The defending champion going into the show was Taboo, who had defeated Silver King, in a steel cage match that also included Dr. Wagner Jr. and La Parka, on October 16, 2011. The match itself reportedly lasted close to an hour and saw several wrestlers interfered before Taboo won the championship. The Mexican National Tag Team Championship was established in 1957, making it one of the earliest examples of a tag team championship. Over the years the championship was primarily promoted by Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (\\"Mexican Wrestling Enterprise\\"; EMLL) and held by famous teams such as Los Hermanos Shadow (Blue Demon and Black Shadow), Los Rebeldes (\\"The Rebels\\"; Rene Guajardo and Karloff Lagarde), Rayo de Jalisco and El Santo and La Ola Blanca (Dr. Wagner and Ángel Blanco). In 1993 then champions Los Destructores (Tony Arce and Rocco Valente) left EMLL to join AAA, bringing with them the Mexican National Tag Team Championship. From that point on it was promoted almost exclusively by AAA. Around 2007 AAA stopped promotion the Mexican National Tag Team Championship and introduced the AAA World Tag Team Championship, at which point the Mexican championship became inactive. Champions La Parka and Octagón revealed that they still had the championship belts in 2011, with IWRG deciding to make the return of the championship the main event of their Guerra de Campeones interpromotional show.

She is the chair of the Research Center Borstel's Department of Immunology and Cell Biology and also serves as professor of Immunobiology at the University of Manchester School of Medicine. Her position at the Board of Directors of the Research Centre Borstel is currently in “abeyance”. Personal life Bulfone-Paus is married to Ralf Paus, a professor in Dermatology at the University of Münster in Germany. Paus also holds a position as Professor of Cutaneous Medicine at the University of Manchester. Bulfone-Paus and Paus have three children. Work and fraud investigations Bulfone-Paus specializes her research in the biology of the immune response, especially cytokines and mast cells. Mast cells secrete a substance known as histamine, which produces inflammation. Cytokines are small molecules made of amino acids. These cell-signaling molecules play a role in the immune response and include interferons and interleukins. =Formal investigation= In the fall of 2009, Bulfone-Paus was alerted to potential misconduct in her lab at the Research Centre Borstel by a biologist and one-time post-doctoral student in Paus’ lab. Bulfone-Paus delayed three months before alerting her institution to the allegations in February 2010. A formal investigation was begun in June of the same year. In July 2010, an anonymous whistleblower(s) began what Nature called a “libelous” “trial-by-internet”. The informer(s) commenced emailing the investigators, other scientists, and politicians, alerting them to instances of fraud in Bulfone-Paus’ laboratory. The anonymous instigator(s) went by several pseudonyms, including Marco Berns, David Hardman, and Fernando Pessoa. Blogs with information regarding the case and the alleged misinformation were posted on a website, hosted in Panama, under the name of Martin Frost. Many expressed their dismay that a colleague would be subjected to such a “smear-campaign”. However, in an editorial in the Lab- Times, the writers express, “Ultimately, we have been left to question whether the ‘Bulfone-Paus stone’ would have actually started rolling without the ‘smear campaign’. To be honest, we doubt it.\\" The formal investigation committee found evidence of image manipulation in six papers written between 2001 and 2009. The blame was placed upon the shoulders of two post-doctoral students in the lab, Russians Elena Bulanova and Vadim Budagian. The investigators also stated they found no conclusive evidence regarding falsification of data and cleared the six papers on that charge. Bulfone-Paus was listed as either the senior or corresponding author on all six of the publications. =DFG and Internal Investigation= DFG, the German Research Foundation, a major supplier of research funding in Germany, also initiated an investigation into Bulfone-Paus’ laboratory in 2010. At the culmination of the formal investigation, the director of the Research Centre Borstel indicated that an internal investigation of the lab was forthcoming, as officials at the center believed a more extensive investigation was warranted. The center commenced its own internal investigation. In December, 2010, officials at the research center made it known they were asking for the retraction of six further papers, written between 1999 and 2005, all authored or co-authored by Silvia Bulfone-Paus. According to a press release from Research Centre Borstel, \\"manipulation\\" was admitted in four of the new retractions. The center found two other publications for which they felt retraction was necessary as well. In response to the findings of their investigation, the Research Centre Borstel downsized Bulfone-Paus’ laboratory and decreased the funding of the lab. In the retraction statement for one of the articles, “A promiscuous liaison between IL-15 and Axl receptor tyrosine kinase in cell death control”, the authors of the paper, minus the two Russian researchers, alleged Bulanova and Budagian performed both the experiments and the data manipulation. The researchers went on to say they believed the results of the experiment were in no way compromised by the fraud. Retraction notices for all twelve papers continued to appear throughout the months of February and March of 2011. =Reaction of the Scientific Community= On March 16, 2011, an open letter, written to the Board of Directors at the Research Centre Borstel and signed by twenty-five scientists hailing from all parts of the globe, was published. In this letter, the scientists repeatedly expressed their admiration and respect for Bulfone-Paus and her contributions to scientific research. The writers also lamented that their esteemed colleague was being held as much responsible for the incidents as the two post-doctoral students. One month later, the Board of Directors of the Research Centre Borstel wrote a reply to the outraged scientists. The letter issues their dismay with the way Bulfone-Paus handled the accusations and her considerable delay before alerting officials at the centre. The letter also states Bulfone-Paus knew of the possibility of misconduct in her laboratory since 2004, when Dr. Wiebauer first brought the issue to her attention. In response to the scientists’ claims that Bulfone-Paus’ considerable and extensive contributions in her field should influence how she was affected by the incident, officials at Borstel said, “Severe failure in one area (as supervisor and responsible senior, corresponding and first author) can hardly be compensated by merits in other areas.” =Further Investigation and Retractions= In June of 2011, Retraction Watch blog reported Blood had made known to them that they were conducting a review of a paper written by Bulfone-Paus in 1999. The article in question listed Bulfone-Paus as senior author and did not list either of the two previously implicated Russian post-doctoral students as contributor to the paper. Also in June, the University of Lubeck, in Germany, began investigations into six papers authored by Bulfone-Paus’ husband, Ralf Paus. Of the six articles in question, Bulfone-Paus was listed as co-author on five of them. Neither of the Russian post-doctoral students were listed as co- authors. In December of the same year, the journal Transplantation stated they were retracting another of Bulfone-Paus’ papers. The article, published in 2000, was retracted because of “inaccurate information” for two figures contained in the paper. As with the article in Blood, Elena Bulanova and Vadim Budagian were not listed as contributing authors.

He was the longest-serving bishop in the diocese's history. Early life Basil Salvadore D'Souza was born on 23 May 1926 in St. Lawrence parish, at Bondel, Mangalore. He was the eldest of seven children to a Mangalorean Catholic couple, Diogo and Mary D'Souza (née Pereira). The family belonged to the D'Souza-Kamath clan, a Mangalorean Catholic clan of the same area. Economically, the family was poor and subsisted on income generated by cultivating betel leaves. D'Souza was ordained into the priesthood on 25 March 1952. He later became the manager of the Catholic Board of Education, and also served at the Kodialbail Press. Bishop of Mangalore Diocese D'Souza was appointed Bishop of Mangalore Diocese on 22 March 1965, and consecrated on 11 May 1965 by Abp James Robert Knox, papal nuncio in India. He would retain the post until his death, thereby becoming the longest-serving bishop of the Mangalore Diocese. D'Souza was among the few participants in the final sessions of the Second Vatican Council which took place from 1962 to 1965. He spearheaded the implementation of the renewal then proclaimed by the council, and became the first Indian bishop to implement the mind and spirit of the Universal Church as envisaged in the Documents of the Second Vatican Council. He was responsible for the introduction of vernacular services in the diocesan churches, where until then the masses were said in Latin. The Bible and other liturgical texts were translated into Konkani during his tenure. He organised the welcoming arrangements for Pope John Paul II during his historic visit to Mangalore on 6 February 1986. D'Souza's long tenure saw the establishment of several new parishes (mainly in the remote villages) and institutions such as family guidance centres. He founded a new mission outside the Mangalore Diocese at Bidar in northern Karnataka, where the number of Christians was small. He adopted the place as a missionary territory, and it later became a part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Gulbarga. D'Souza served as Chairman of the CBCI Commission of Vocations, in which capacity he founded the National Vocation Centre at Poona. He also founded the Chair of Christianity at Mangalore University in 1987. Death D'Souza died of heart attack on 5 September 1996. During his time of death, D'Souza was just five years away from retirement His remains were interred at the Rosario Cathedral on 9 September 1996. On 8 November, he was succeeded as Bishop of Mangalore Diocese by Aloysius Paul D'Souza. Citations References *.

Squelching has been mostly studied in yeast, and most of the ideas regarding its mechanisms have come from research into modes of transcriptional control in yeast.Freedman, Leonard P. Molecular Biology of Steroid and Nuclear Hormone Receptors. Progress in Gene Expression. Boston: Birkhauser, 1998. Print. One important study of this topic was conducted using the Gal4-VP16 artificial transcription factor system, where it was shown that the activating complex formed by VP-16 was sequestering adapters required for transcription of other targets.Heslot, H., and Claude Gaillardin. Molecular Biology and Genetic Engineering of Yeasts. Boca Raton, Fla.: CRC Press, 1992. Print. The primary cause of squelching is believed to be the interaction of activator molecules disrupting the biochemical pathways associated with related processes due to structural similarity between the activators and important substrates along that pathway. In particular, the activator binds to transcription factors along alternative biochemical pathways, inhibiting the ability of these transcription factors to bind to their true targets. As in the example above, sequestration of an intermediate in a metabolic pathway is a confounding variable in genetic studies because knowledge of the expected binding targets of the primary molecules involved does not help predict why unexpected behavior results.

Located along Main Street on the village's western side, the house has been designated a historic site because of its historic architecture and because of a famous former resident. Born in the town of Langensteinbach in the Grand Duchy of Baden, Georg Cronenwett settled in the United States in 1832 at the age of eighteen. After nine years of life in Monroe, Michigan, he moved to Woodville at the end of 1841. Throughout this time, Cronenwett was a prominent Lutheran missionary in the Great Black Swamp region of northwestern Ohio and southeastern Michigan. In Woodville, he established his center of operations; among the organizations that he founded in the area were a church school and the Woodville Seminary.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 1229. Cronenwett arranged for the construction of the present house in 1858. Built in the Greek Revival style of architecture, it is a brick building with a stone foundation., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2012-01-22. Some parts are older than others; Cronenwett's original house was only the center of the current structure. This original portion is three bays wide and entered through a recessed main entrance on one side. The house was the first Woodville building to be erected as a parsonage. In late 1978, the Georg Cronenwett House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It qualified for this designation in two different ways: its architecture was deemed of historic significance, and Cronenwett was such an important member of the community's history that the house qualified because of its connection to him. More than seven years later, one other Fremont building joined the Cronenwett House on the National Register: the Christopher C. Layman Law Office, an Italianate building on First Street.

The scandal broke in January 2012, when Hungarian news organizations published a number of articles claiming that about 197 pages of Schmitt's 215-page thesis had been lifted from works by other, foreign scholars, without giving appropriate credit. On 11 January 2012, a Hungarian news portal, hvg.hu published an article which claimed that material that amounts to around 180 of the 215 pages of Pál Schmitt's 1992 doctoral (dr. univ.) thesis, titled \\"Az újkori olimpiai játékok programjának elemzése\\" (\\"An analysis of the programme of the modern Olympics\\"), had been lifted from a 1987 manuscript by Bulgarian sports researcher Nikolay Georgiev, together with a page's worth of material from a work by Hristo Meranzov and Georgiev. On 19 January, news organizations found that an additional 17 pages had been copied from a paper by German sport sociologist Klaus Heinemann. The late Georgiev's daughter said she did not know of any cooperation between Schmitt and her father in the preparation of Georgiev's work. Heinemann denied any knowledge of Schmitt, and expressed his concerns about the plagiarism allegations. Further concerns about a conflict of interest were raised when it was reported that multiple members of Schmitt's thesis committee had also been members of the Hungarian Olympic Academy and the Hungarian Olympic Committee, organizations both headed by Schmitt at the time his title was awarded. After the initial report, Schmitt denied the allegations, saying that no plagiarism took place, as he had listed Georgiev's work in the list of works cited. The President made no further comments, including any comments about the allegation regarding the Heinemann text, until a radio interview in which he shrugged off the claim, saying that it was natural for all such works to include a certain amount of common \\"core material\\". A number of scholars started a petition asking for a fair and transparent investigation of the allegations. Although they have PhD degrees, the Hungarian National News Agency (MTI) referred to them as doctoral students. After a formal investigation, a five-member fact finding committee at Semmelweis University delivered a report on 27 March. The University Council advised the University Senate to withdraw Schmitt's doctorate title. The University Senate withdrew Schmitt's title on 29 March. On 2 April, Schmitt announced to the Hungarian Parliament that he would resign as President. Background =Pál Schmitt= Schmitt was a successful fencer in his youth, winning two gold medals at the Summer Olympic Games. Later, he served as an ambassador during the 1990s, and he was a Member of the European Parliament with the Fidesz party from 2004 to 2010. After briefly serving as Speaker of the National Assembly of Hungary in 2010, Schmitt was elected as President of Hungary in a 263 to 59 vote in the Parliament of Hungary; he was sworn in as President on 2010. From 1983 to 1988 Schmitt was the general secretary of the Hungarian Olympic Committee, and in 1981–1990 he was undersecretary for sport. In 1990, after the end of Communism in Hungary, he became president of the Hungarian Olympic Committee, a post he held until 2010. =Faculty of Sport Sciences, Semmelweis University= Founded in 1769, Semmelweis University is the oldest medical school in Hungary, located in Budapest. Becoming an independent medical school after the Second World War it developed into a university teaching medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, health sciences, health management, and following the merger with the University of Physical Education, physical education and sport sciences. The university is named after Ignác Semmelweis. Today's Faculty of Physical Education and Sport Sciences at the Semmelweis University was founded in 1925 as a separate institution, Hungarian Royal Physical Education College. Between 1945 and 1989 it operated under the name of Hungarian College of Physical Education, and in 1989 it became the Hungarian University of Physical Education. In 2000 the previously independent university became part of the Semmelweis University as the Faculty of Sport Sciences. =Dr. Univ. versus PhD= Until 1993 the only doctoral title Hungarian universities could award was the doctor universitatis, or dr. univ., title. It was not considered to be an academic degree. The so-called candidate's degree (C.Sc.) was the first post-graduate scientific degree, and it was issued by the Committee of Scientific Qualifications of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. The requirements for the univ. dr. title were generally below the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) requirements, while those of the candidate's degree were above the PhD level. In 1993, the PhD degree was introduced in Hungary, and the universities had the jurisdiction to convert dr. univ. degrees to PhD doctorates on a case-by- case basis, if they met the necessary requirements. (The conversion of the candidate's titles had been automatic, on request.) Schmitt's degree was not converted, although his CV on the website of the EU Parliament states that he has a PhD.CV – Pál Schmitt In 2012, his CV on the IOC website also listed his title as \\"doctor of philosophy.\\" Allegations of misconduct =Plagiarism= 390pxthumbThe known extent of plagiarism in Pál Schmitt's dissertation. Identified sources: ██ Georgiev (1987) ██ Heinemann (1991) ██ Le mouvement olympique / The Olympic Movement (1990) ██ Olympic Charter (1991) ██ Defrantz (1991) The location of the approximately two pages worth of material drawn from Meranzov & Georgiev (1985) in the text has not yet been disclosed. On 11 January 2012, hvg.hu published an article claiming that most of Schmitt's 1992 thesis, 180 of the 215 pages, was almost a word-for-word translation of parts of Bulgarian sport scholar and diplomat Nikolay Georgiev's 465-page 1987 French-language manuscript Analyse du programme olympique (des Jeux d’Olympiade), and it also contained a page worth of material from the 1985 work Analysis of the Olympic Programme by Hristo Meranzov and Nikolay Georgiev. The site also published a 12-page PDF document containing excerpts from both Georgiev's manuscript and Schmitt's dissertation for comparison. Heti Világgazdaság remarked that Schmitt's dissertation did not contain in- body citations, only a bibliography listing 21 pieces of literature. In this bibliography the place of publication of Georgiev's manuscript was erroneously given as Bulgaria, instead of Lausanne, Switzerland, and the title of the work was given in Hungarian, although Georgiev's work has not been published in Hungary. The piece also reported that the dissertation contains a multitude of spelling mistakes, some mistranslations and erroneous statements that were present in Georgiev's manuscript. Though the reviewers of the dissertation, István Kertész and Ferenc Takács, had multiple issues regarding the dissertation, both of them gave the work summa cum laude, the highest rating that can be awarded. On 18 January Schmitt gave a radio interview in which he stated that around 30–35 pages in his thesis was material original to him and contained conclusions drawn from the \\"core material\\". (See below.) In response, Heti Világgazdaság reported that, in contrast to what Schmitt stated in the radio interview, the Conclusions section of his thesis (a single page) is also mostly part of the material that had been lifted from Georgiev's work. On 19 January, the news portal Index.hu reported that parts of the remaining 35 pages of Schmitt's dissertation were translated and copied from German sport sociologist Klaus Heinemann's 1991 work The Economics of Sport: The Institution of Modern Sport as an Area of Economic Competition. A reference to this work was found in Schmitt's Bibliography, but again, the title was translated into Hungarian, where no such translation existed. Later that day, Heti Világgazdaság—in possession of the text of Schmitt's dissertation—confirmed that a direct translation of eight out of the nine pages of Heinemann's work amounts to further 17 pages of Schmitt's dissertation. Heti Világgazdaság published another five-page PDF document comparing Heinemann's work and Schmitt's dissertation. On 6 March hvg.hu announced that they have identified further sources. According to hvg.hu the first few pages of Schmitt's dissertation contain text from a 1990 educational brochure (The Olympic Movement / Le Mouvement Olympique) published by the International Olympic Committee. Though the Bibliography section of the dissertation contains a reference to this work, it is given in Hungarian and with incorrectly specified bibliographic information. Text drawn from the Olympic Charter (1992) has also been found in Schmitt's work. hvg.hu also reported that the seven tables and two charts that make up the appendix of Schmitt's dissertation have also been taken from Georgiev's 1987 manuscript Analyse du programme olympique, without proper attribution of authorship. The original hvg.hu research that broke the controversy was done by an anonymous freelancer, and regular commenter on the hvg.hu website, over a stretch of nine months, with interruptions. The origins of the remaining circa 18 pages are not known, but the staff of hvg.hu were researching whether they are Schmitt's own work or not. Further plagiarized sources were identified by readers of the website Index.hu on 29 March. Among others, Schmitt included word-by-word translations from a work by IOC member Anita DeFrantz without referencing it at all. (DeFrantz happens to be the one who recommended Schmitt's daughter Petra for a University of Southern California tennis scholarship during the Salt Lake City Olympic bid. Petra Schmitt went on to make All-American of the Intercollegiate Tennis Association.) =Thesis committee conflicts of interest= Conflict of interest concerns regarding the doctoral thesis committee have been raised. Schmitt defended his 1992 thesis before a committee headed by József Tihanyi. The other four members were Csaba Istvánfi, the late Mihály Nyerges and the two reviewers, István Kertész and Ferenc Takács. In an article on 18 January Népszabadság cited the 37th section of the 1985 Doctoral Regulations of the Hungarian College of Physical Education, which stated that a person from whom an objective assessment of the candidate's work cannot be expected may not participate in review of the doctoral dissertation. In the opinion of Népszabadság, Kertész and Takács both had conflicting interests, since they were members of the Council of the Hungarian Olympic Academy (MOA, an organization founded by the Hungarian Olympic Committee), headed by Schmitt. On 19 January the news portal Origo stated that Takács had been a member of the MOA since 1985, and that Kertész became a member in 1992. In 1992 both Istvánfi and Nyerges were members of the Hungarian Olympic Committee (MOB), and Tihanyi joined in 1994. Takács is also a member. Schmitt was the president of the MOA between 1985 and 1990, and general secretary of the MOB between 1990 and 2010. Tihanyi told Origo that \\"with hindsight it is unfortunate\\" that Schmitt had to defend his dissertation before committee members who were also members of the MOB, but he added that the university regulations at that time only regulated conflicts of interest that were limited to the university. Reactions =Office of the President= Four hours after the publication of the hvg.hu article that raised the issue of plagiarism the Office of the President issued the following statement: =Malina Georgieva= In an interview with hvg.hu, Malina Georgieva, daughter of the late Nikolay Georgiev, indicated that her father and Schmitt both worked at IOC in Lausanne and knew each other. Nonetheless, she found it implausible that the two cooperated on the research, and called the allegation of Georgiev omitting credit preposterous. She also denied any intention to litigate, noting that because her father's research was funded by the IOC, the IOC holds the copyright over the original document. =Pál Schmitt= Schmitt was attending the Youth Olympic Games in Austria at the time hvg.hu published the article on the alleged plagiarism. His first official appearance was six days later on 16 January at the residence of the President, Sándor Palace, where he appointed Norbert Csizmadia as state secretary of the Ministry for National Economy. The press was asked by a staff member of the Office of the President \\"not to disrupt the event by asking questions\\". Schmitt was scheduled to give a talk on 19 January at the Károly Eszterházy College in Eger. On 17 January students of the College received a message via the internal university website stating that \\"[t]he Office of the President decided, considering the obligations of the students, that Dr Pál Schmitt, President of the Republic, is not going to disrupt the examination period (neither the exams nor the preparation for the exams) with his presentation\\". On 18 January Schmitt gave a half-hour radio interview on MR1, during which he was asked about the allegations. Regarding the lack of in-body citations he stated that the regulations at that time allowed for the listing the sources only as a Bibliography section at the end of the dissertation. He said that in his opinion, because he listed Georgiev's work in this Bibliography the term \\"plagiarism\\" has no relevance in this case. He further stated that the 180 pages he used are basic data, and as such, they are not in the property of anyone. He also added that there are ns 30 to 35 pages in the dissertation that contain conclusions drawn by himself from the previously mentioned \\"basic material\\". Regarding the outcome of the controversy he said: \\"I am looking forward to the resolution of this issue, and I sincerely hope that I can clear myself of the accusation behind which I cannot suspect anything more than mere malice.\\" On 19 January it was reported that, in contrast to Schmitt's statements in the radio interview, 18 of the remaining 35 pages were not original to him; since that point there have been no further comments from the President. =Hungarian Government= On 13 January the news portal Index.hu asked Péter Szijjártó, spokesman for Prime Minister of Hungary Viktor Orbán to comment on the issue; he wrote that \\"we do not wish to address such an undeserving tabloid-hoax\\". In a television interview for TV2 on 16 January, when asked what the official opinion of the Hungarian Government was responding to the allegations, Szijjártó reiterated: \\"to tell you honestly, I find this whole thing undeserving, that they are trying to get the President of the Republic involved in such a tabloid-hoax\\". He further added that he finds the timing of the accusations suspicious: \\"this tabloid-hoax surfaced one day after the President of the Republic stood up firmly on the side of Hungary, against the attacks, at a reception for the leaders of the diplomatic corps.\\" In a television interview for ATV on 13 January András Giró-Szász, spokesman for the Hungarian Government was asked about the stance of the Government on the issue. He said: \\"Look, my original profession and my studies have led me to the field of history at one time, and there I have learned, and this I can support with examples from history, that the head of the state is essentially the first person of the state. And the members of the Government are the servants of the state. Its first servants. [...] It follows from this that the only task of any Government in power in this regard is to unconditionally support the President of the Republic in office.\\" The spokesman was then asked whether, in the opinion of the Government, Schmitt should resign if the allegations would turn out to be valid. He replied that there is no possibility of intervention, no obligation and no such intention from the side of the Government. In the autumn of 2011 the State Secretariat for Education of the Ministry of National Resources published an announcement in which the state secretary for education, Rózsa Hoffmann reminded all university and college students that \\"submitting a thesis written by someone else as one's own work constitutes a criminal offence\\". She also wrote that if the Ministry of National Resources becomes aware of a case of thesis-related abuse, it is going to file a complaint with the National Police Headquarters. Hoffmann stressed that it is not permissible to allow students to obtain diplomas through fraud. In light of this announcement Heti Világgazdaság asked the Secretariat for Education on 13 January to comment on the issue of Schmitt's alleged plagiarism; Hoffmann's Secretariat told the journalists that they should turn to the Office of the President instead. =Klaus Heinemann= On 19 January Index.hu reported that parts of Schmitt's dissertation came from Klaus Heinemann's The Economics of Sport: the Institution of Modern Sport as an Area of Economic Competition. hvg.hu soon confirmed this finding, stating that eight pages out of Heinemann's nine-page long work correspond to about 17 pages in Schmitt's dissertation. On 23 January Heinemann told Index.hu that he is seriously concerned by the case, partially because of professional ethical reasons, especially since an important politician is involved. He added: \\"My scientific recognition is significantly linked to this work of mine that contains important findings, therefore it is shocking to hear that others have used it to further their academic recognition undeservingly.\\" Heinemann also responded to earlier reports that Semmelweis University has difficulties setting up a committee of inquiry because experts qualified to be members are turning down requests to join. He wrote: \\"It reflects badly on my Hungarian colleagues, if, because of political opportunism, they are reluctant to punish those who violate basic and essential ethical norms of science.\\" =Hungarian scientific community= Petition to investigate On 16 January, seven scholars, mainly historians, started a petition asking the rector of the Semmelweis University, the Minister of National Resources, and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences for a fair, public and transparent investigation of the allegations. The authors of the petition expressed their dissatisfaction with the reaction of the dean of the Faculty of Sport Sciences at Semmelweis University who stated that the procedure of the issuance of the dr. univ. title was according to regulations, the reviews were unambiguous, therefore did not call for a formal investigation. Batthyány Society of Professors Physicist Rezső Lovas, a member of the MTA and the president of the Batthyány Society of Professors, a conservative association of university lecturers, said on 17 January: \\"First of all, one should not jump to hasty conclusions. I have not seen Pál Schmitt's dissertation, nor the article he allegedly drew from. There are many ways of drawing from [sources], and there is a continuous transition between citation and explicit plagiarism\\". He also added that in his opinion it is unlikely that the allegations can be proven valid. He further asked whether there was any evidence presented, stating that the burden of proof is on those accusing Schmitt. Hungarian Academy of Sciences On 18 January, in response to the petition, József Pálinkás, president of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences wrote that since Schmitt does not hold a scientific degree (PhD) and is not a member of the public body of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, the Academy has no jurisdiction to conduct an investigation into the allegations of plagiarism. Formal investigation On 11 January György Bazsa, president of the Hungarian Accreditation committee stated that an investigation needs to be conducted by the university that issued the title. Károly Rácz, head of the Semmelweis University Doctoral Council did not wish to comment on the allegations of plagiarism regarding Schmitt's dissertation, stating that the dr. univ. degree was not awarded by the doctoral school that issues PhD titles introduced in 1993. On 13 January Miklós Tóth, the dean of the Faculty of Sport Sciences at Semmelweis University issued a statement claiming that the evaluation and the issuance of the dr. univ. title was conducted according to standard procedures and that according to experts the content of the dissertation adhered to the requirements at that time. He further stated that \\"there is no reason to assume that the thesis committee did not deliver a well-founded decision\\" when it assessed Schmitt's 1992 dissertation. On 17 January Tivadar Tulassay, the rector of the Semmelweis University instructed Miklós Tóth, the dean of Faculty of Sport Sciences, to assemble a committee of inquiry to investigate \\"the circumstances under which Pál Schmitt’s doctoral dissertation came into being.\\" On 21 January Népszabadság reported that experts qualified to assess the allegations are turning down requests to participate in the work of the committee of inquiry. In the opinion of Népszabadság this is obviously due to the politically sensitive nature of the issue. On 24 January Népszabadság reported that the Semmelweis University is exploring the possibility asking experts from outside the country to examine Schmitt's doctoral dissertation. These experts would investigate whether the quotations in the dissertation form Georgiev's and Heinemann's works have been used correctly and according to the regulations. It is argued that if the suspected plagiarism is confirmed, then it will be easier to carry out the necessary administrative and legal measures. The same day hvg.hu wrote that its sources confirmed the earlier reports that experts are turning down requests to participate in the work of the committee that is designated to investigate the allegations of plagiarism in Schmitt's dissertation. According to the sources of Heti Világgazdaság, the reason for the experts' reluctance is a fear that they may suffer a disadvantage in their careers. University sources did not confirm the reports that the university is considering to ask for the participation of experts from outside the country. Semmelweis University ordered a news black- out but, according to the sources of Heti Világgazdaság, the university would like to see the case closed as soon as possible, although the investigations could be prolonged until autumn 2013. On 25 January Miklós Tóth, the dean of the Faculty of Sport Sciences at Semmelweis University, announced that a five- member fact-finding committee had been set up, and would deliver a report by 28 March. The committee included both external and internal members, experts in linguistics, law, sports and the social sciences. The members of the committee remained anonymous for the duration of the investigation. =Members of the fact-finding committee= The members of the fact-finding committee were: * Miklós Tóth: dean of the Faculty of Sport Sciences, Semmelweis University * Ákos Fluck: lawyer * János Gombocz: Department of Physical Education Theory and Pedagogy, Semmelweis University * Etele Kovács: Department of Athletics, Semmelweis University * Károly Rácz: President of the Doctoral Council, School of Doctoral Studies, Semmelweis University Issues of conflicts of interest have been raised with regard to the fact-finding committee; Népszabadság found it problematic that Miklós Tóth became dean and a member of the MOB after the FIDESZ-KDNP government took office, and he became vice-president of the Olympic Committee during the course of the investigation. =Majority report= The committee released a 3-page summary of its 1,100-page report to the public on 28 March. The report states that the 197 pages in question were indeed verbatim copies of Georgiev's and Heinemann's respective works. However, the report also states the lack of citations and references were \\"formal mistakes\\" that should have been addressed by the supervisors, who, by failing to do so, could have led Schmitt to believe that the thesis met the requirements. Semmelweis University, citing privacy reasons, has not made the majority report public. Heti Világgazdaság filed a complaint about the university's argument with the Hungarian National Authority for Data Protection and Freedom of Information. The summary, after establishing the legal context for awarding the dr. univ. title at the University of Physical Education, has the following sections. Procedure The report notes that conspicuously (although not against the regulations), the defense took place barely a month after registration. Some missing documents, however, imply formal irregularities. Namely, the thesis proposal, the report on the comprehensive examination, and the minutes of the thesis committee could not be found. The report faults the thesis advisor and the examiners for not alerting the candidate to the inappropriate or absent citations, which are largely typical of the thesis. Further procedural errors are implied by the lack of proper bibliography (5 out of 21 cited references could not be identified; out of 23 self-citations, 10 could not be found, and 3 were cited wrongly). Thesis The report asserts that the author did not indicate his sources anywhere in the thesis. The text uses neither quotation marks, nor author names in parentheses, nor footnotes, nor endnotes. The Committee also notes that the thesis does not contain any acknowledgments of support from collaborators. The report notes in particular the textual identities with Klaus Heinemann's work, the figures and tables copied (with occasional minor modifications) from Nikolay Georgiev's manuscript, and further 180 text pages partially matching the same work. Conclusion The report draws the conclusion that the thesis procedure was, notwithstanding the procedural shortcomings, in accordance with the practices of the University of Physical Education at the time. The thesis is based on a word-by-word translation of \\"unusually large extent,\\" which should have been detected at the defense. The report faults the University of Physical Education for leading the author believe that this thesis met the requirements. =Minority report= The only external member of the fact- finding committee, Ákos Fluck, submitted a minority report that became public on the evening of 27 March. The minority report notes that it has been established that figure 1 of Schmitt's dissertation is a photocopy of the figure on page 10 of Georgiev's work. The report also notes that at one time Schmitt refers to a figure 10 in the text, while the dissertation does not have ten figures; this part of the text is a direct translation taken from Georgiev's work, which indeed has a figure 10. In the minority report, Ákos Fluck wrote: \\"Based on the fact-finding work, an investigation into the possibility of, as well as the procedures for, withdrawing the doctorate title from the candidate is advised.\\" The minority report also recounted that Schmitt had received the fact-finding committee's chair in his office. The chair communicated Schmitt's opinion to the other committee members: Schmitt's good faith should not be questioned, since he was not alerted by his advisor and thesis committee about any possible shortcomings, thus echoing the fact- finding report's conclusion. =Reactions to the report= The report has met considerable controversy upon release, with members of opposition claiming that the Semmelweis University caved in to political pressure. Pál Schmitt Pál Schmitt was attending the 2012 Seoul Nuclear Security Summit in South Korea at the time the three-page summary of the fact-finding committee was made public. Speaking of the report Schmitt told the MTI that \\"this final conclusion is a kind of satisfaction for [him]: I was right even back then 20 years ago, because I wrote a thesis to the best of my knowledge and in keeping with the circumstances and the requirements of the time\\". He also said that he did \\"not for a moment\\" think that he would resign, as qualities other than his doctorate were the reasons for his election. Schmitt returned from the summit to Hungary at 10:30 pm (CET). Government coalition On 27 March Fidesz spokesperson Gabriella Selmeczi said that \\"given the report of the fact-finding committee of the Semmelweis University, Fidesz considers the case closed\\". In a press release the Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP) stated that the report \\"can bring satisfying closure to the allegations that questioned the originality of the president's dissertation\\". Klaus Heinemann In a letter to Index.hu, Klaus Heinemann called the report's majority conclusion \\"ridiculous nonsense\\". In his opinion, had the committee appointed to investigate the allegations of plagiarism of zu Guttenberg come to the same conclusion—that is, putting the blame on the university itself—\\"they would have won a prize for their excellent cabaret-joke\\" and \\"everyone would still be laughing at them to this day\\". According to Index.hu, Heinemann was unaware that Schmitt's doctorate had been revoked by the University Senate. University decision The rector of Semmelweis University forwarded the fact-finding committee's report to Minister of National Resources Miklós Réthelyi on 27 March 2012. The University was of the opinion that only the Ministry had the authority to initiate the revocation of the dr. univ. title (citing a legal article on degrees awarded by defunct institutions of higher education). The Minister returned the report the following day, citing lack of jurisdiction. Tivadar Tulassay, the rector of the Semmelweis University announced on 29 March that the Semmelweis University Council would launch proceedings in order to withdraw Schmitt's doctorate title. The same day the University Senate voted 33-4 to withdraw Schmitt's doctorate title. =Reactions= Pál Schmitt Schmitt canceled all his appointments for 30 March and Norbert Kiss, the Public Relations Manager of the Office of the President announced that at 8 pm Schmitt \\"is going to answer all questions\\" in a TV interview. On 30 March 9 pm M1 aired a 15-minute, pre-recorded, heavily orchestrated interview in which Schmitt announced that he would not resign from office, as there was no connection between his role as President and his doctorate. He said that he had acted in good faith regarding his dissertation, and that he had been led to believe by his thesis committee that his conduct had been correct, effectively repeating the majority conclusion of the Semmelweis University fact-finding committee. He also said that he intended to write a new dissertation and acquire a Ph.D. degree. Government parties On 29 March Botond Szalma, the president of KDNP's Budapest group issued a statement in which he hailed the decision of the University Council and asked for the apology or resignation of those politicians who were \\"working on ways to cover up this scandal instead of bringing the truth to light.\\" He added: \\"a sin must be called a sin, black must be called black, and white must be called white, as Christian morality dictates\\". On 31 March, after Schmitt announced that he was not considering resignation, KDNP issued a press release distancing the party from Szalma's statements, saying: \\"The Christian Democratic People's Party would like to stress that the statements of the president of the Budapest group in the recent days do not reflect the views of the party as a whole, and the statements he made openly go against the official stance of the KDNP\\". Batthyány Society of Professors Soon after the controversy erupted, Rezső Lovas, the president of the Batthyány Society of Professors (PBK), a pro-government group of university lecturers, said that in his opinion it is unlikely that the allegations can be proven valid. On 29 March, after the Semmelweis University Council decided to initiate the revocation of Schmitt's doctorate, the Society issued a press release stating that \\"The Doctoral Council has drawn the conclusions on the matter for its part. We hope that the president will do the same.\\" They further state that \\"at a time when we are suffering from a double standard used against our homeland, it is of utmost importance to have only one standard in our country, and that standard should be applied to everyone. In the current difficult situation that the country is in, there is a need for a president who is respected both at home and abroad.\\" The Batthyány Society of Professors came under criticism because of its handling of the case of Schmitt's plagiarism. Because of the support given to Schmitt and the lack of appropriate response an article on hirszerzo.hu termed the right-wing, Christian groups of academics and intelligentsia (such as the PBK, the Hungarian Association for Civic Cooperation and the Society of Christian Intellectuals) the \\"Schmittpali Society of Professors\\". A 31 March essay on Heti Világgazdaság called the Society \\"professors abusing the name of Batthyány\\". Hungarian Accreditation Committee On 2 April the president of the Hungarian Accreditation Committee announced that the decision of the University Senate was legitimate according to relevant regulations. =Rector's resignation= On 1 April Tivadar Tulassay resigned as rector of Semmelweis University. He had served as rector for nine years and his term would have ended on 1 July. As the reason for his immediate resignation, he cited a \\"fundamental loss of trust\\" that he perceived on the part of Minister of National Resources, Miklós Réthelyi, and State Secretary for Education, Rózsa Hoffmann, during the decision-making process. He also stated that he stands behind the decision made by the University Senate, on ethical, professional and legal grounds. =Resignation= According to a poll conducted by Medián and published on 18 January 6% of Fidesz voters expressed the opinion that Schmitt should resign. 77% of the MSZP, LMP and DK, 28% of Jobbik supporters and 30% of independent voters thought that he should not remain in office. Taking the whole sample into consideration, 33% of the population thought that Schmitt should resign, while 42% thought that he should remain in office, the remaining 25% expressed no opinion. On 2 April, the Hungarian Parliament received Schmitt's resignation from the office of President. On 15 May 2013, Schmitt formally resigned from his doctorate after an academic remedy commission declared that his thesis did not meet the criteria, either in terms of content or formal requirements.

It became virtually extinct in the 20th century, but the population is recovering. It is a different breed from the Valdarno chicken, which originates in the lower part of the Valdarno, and is black. History The Valdarnese chicken takes its name from the Valdarno, the valley of the Arno river. It was in the past extensively raised in the upper part of the Arno valley which runs south-east from Florence towards Arezzo, in the comuni of Montevarchi, San Giovanni Valdarno and Terranuova Bracciolini in the heart of the valley, and neighbouring comuni including Bucine, Castelfranco di Sopra, Cavriglia, Figline Valdarno, Pergine Valdarno, Laterina and Loro Ciuffenna. The first description of the white chickens of the Valdarno is that by Licciardelli in 1899. Pochini (1900, 1905) recommends the Valdarno breed above all others as suitable for both small- and large- scale rearing, for its rapid growth and the maternal instinct of the hens, but notes that it requires space and does not adapt well to close confinement. He illustrates four colour varieties, black, white, buff and cuckoo, and notes that the black and the white are the most common. The Valdarno breed was also described by Faelli in 1905. Various examples of white Valdarnese chickens were exhibited in Cremona and Varese in the 1950s. In the following years the Valdarnese became the subject of extended and heated discussion of its authenticity, with critics maintaining that its high productivity was due to hybrid vigour. The breed also had supporters, and a breed association was formed in 1955. Studies of the qualities of the breed by Quilici, director of the Stazione Sperimentale di Pollicoltura (experimental poultry-breeding station) of Rovigo from 1957 led to the first scientific description of the Valdarnese breed. The collapse of the traditional mezzadria system in the 1960s caused a rapid decline in breed numbers, aggravated both by the growth of intensive methods of poultry-farming and by competition from the White Leghorn breed, of which chicks incubated in northern Italy were readily available. The breed association closed in 1964, and the Valdarnese continued to decline through the later 20th century until it had virtually disappeared. The risk of extinction of the breed was recognised in the 1990s, and the Conservatorio delle Razze Avicole in Pericolo di Estinzione (conservation centre for avian breeds in danger of extinction) of the Veneto region began a repopulation programme. When the Conservatorio closed in 2001, the remaining breeding stock was transferred to the Valdarno area. This stock formed the basis for a project for the recovery and protection of the breed launched by the Agenzia Regionale per lo Sviluppo e l'Innovazione nel Settore Agricolo- Forestale (ARSIA), a part of the Tuscan regional administration for agriculture. The Valdarnese is not included in the official standard of the Federazione Italiana Associazioni Avicole, the federation of Italian poultry associations, which is the national authority governing poultry breeding in Italy. It is, however, recognised by the Regione Toscana, the regional administration of Tuscany, which publishes the breed standard. A breed register is held by the Associazione Provinciale Allevatori, or provincial breeders' association, of Arezzo. Breed numbers remain low. A study published in 2007 used a figure of approximately 1200 for the total breeding stock, of which approximately 300 were cocks. Characteristics The Valdarnese is white, with some tendency to straw-colour on the neck and back allowable in cocks. The legs are orange-yellow, and the skin is yellow. The comb and wattles are large and blood-red; the comb has 5–6 points. The ear-lobes are creamy yellow with some red veining. Average weight is for cocks, for hens. The eggs are white and should weigh 58–70 g. Uses The Valdarnese is raised principally for its meat, which is firm and tasty, and notably different from that produced by intensive farming methods. Approximately 6000 birds are slaughtered per year. Hens tend to become broody, and are poor layers; they lay an average of 135 eggs per year.

Introduced to transport raw milk from remote dairy farms to central creameries, milk trains were the last railway-based system before the move to road transport. Background Typical pre-World War I scene of milk churns waiting to be picked up by the milk train, recreated at Quorn and Woodhouse station on the preserved Great Central Railway Post grouping in 1923, of the of milk transported by rail by all four national railways companies, the Great Western Railway had the largest share of milk traffic, serving the rural and highly agricultural West of England and South Wales; followed by the LMS which collected from Cumbria and North Wales; the Southern particularly from the Somerset and Dorset Railway; and finally the LNER from East Anglia. Often, the milk was delivered direct from the farmer to the local railway station in milk churns. So to remove the need for moving unprocessed milk from one container to another, and hence potential cross contamination or need to install hygienic washing facilities, the decision was taken to transport the milk churns. From the 1880s, the GWR had introduced the popular GWR Siphon series of passenger carriage chassis-based high-speed and ventilated enclosed wagons, but with volumes rising and production systems changing, the transport system had to change. Design Under the milk churn system, the steel churn had been owned either by the farmer or the dairy, to which was attached a paper delivery note for the railway. The three participants hence agreed to adopt the same ownership system for the new milk tank wagons, whereby the chassis was supplied by the railway company, while the carrying tank was supplied by the dairy. The first designs were introduced by the GWR and the LMS in 1927, followed a year later by the LNER. The SR initially experimented with roll- on/roll-off two or three-axled road trailers, which after being towed to each farm by a dairy company or SR lorry, could be taken to the railway station and then strapped down on a standard railway flat wagon. 60 of these road tankers were built, but although the system survived in some areas, by 1931 the SR had abandoned marketing the system and moved inline with the other railway companies, under pressure from the big dairies. The GWR later trialled the idea, and some tanks were redeployed to the Western Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. Preserved United Dairies three-axle Milk Tank Wagon at the Bluebell Railway, based on an SR chassis The initial milk tank wagon designs were based on a two axle railway wagon chassis. There was a ladder either side to allow filling via an industrial rubber hose into a flip- top dome casing, while a steel pipe exited at the bottom of the tank with a tap either end of the chassis between the buffer beams for extraction. All designs unlike typical goods wagons used vacuum braking, due to their high- speed deployment. The various designs that railway companies used followed a common pattern, but even at this early stage differences appeared making them easy to spot. While GWR designs used flat-strip metal as bracing, LMS and SR designs used rounded steel bracing. SR designs had additional V-shaped support bracing either end, and had additional wooden packing behind each of the buffers. LMS designs had a catwalk around the filling dome. The first tanks were labelled externally as being glass-lined (they were actually vitreous enamel), meaning that the wagons themselves were unauthorised for loose or hump shunting, a reminder of which was applied in large capital letters to the chassis. Early tank design had no baffles, meaning that the milk self-churned during the journey, and made the wagon highly unstable. After the required improvement in milk quality was not gained, and a number of derailment accidents, three-axled six-wheel wagons were introduce from 1931, and baffles became standard practise. The last of the two-axle design were withdrawn pre- World War II, while three-axle designs continued in production under British Railways into the early 1950s, but now with stainless steel linings. Later, limited production twin-tank designs were introduced, all based on triple-axle chassis. More common on the GWR, they were also used by the SR for transport of dairy products from the Channel Islands that came in via Southampton Docks. Twin-tanks allowed the easy collection from smaller dairies of both premium gold-top, as well as other silver-top products. In total, across all four railway companies, some 600 three-axle milk tank wagons were produced. Livery Preserved detail on a typical pre-World War II United Dairies three-axle Milk Tank Wagon at the National Railway Museum, based on an SR chassis Preserved Milk Marketing Board three-axle Milk Tank Wagon at the East Somerset Railway, based on a GWR chassis Each railway company applied its own logo and number to the chassis, while each dairy applied its own separate colouring, fleet number and labelling to the carried milk tank. The wagons as out-shopped from various railway works were highly decorated - often to show both cleanliness, good hygiene, and as a travelling advertising board. Early designs had a high amount of labelling, mentioning insulation, hygienic glass lining, and the dairy company name in large superscript and shadowed letters on the sides of the tank. The resultant wagons were kept very clean by both the dairies (who washed them at both ends of the journey), and the handling railway companies. After the Milk Marketing Board was created in 1933, in 1942 during World War II they took control of all milk transport. Only when the wagons needed a repaint, did the MMB apply a standard branded design of silver-grey with \\"MMB MILK\\" embossed in high black letters externally. Some of the last MMB designs used a blue tank colour with white lettering. Hence, many of the former private owner wagons designs survived well into British Railways ownership, in a now faded and flaking state. MMB were not so fastidious on cleanliness standards, and so often in photographs either the cleaned silver paint has faded to white, or the wagons look dirty. By the late 1960s the MMB had switched entirely to road haulage, and only Express Dairies and Unigate continued to use rail transport. Both companies used former MMB stock supplied by British Railways, but while Express Dairies applied their own numbering to the tank, Unigate referenced their wagons through the BR chassis number. Unhappy with the image of the faded and dirty liveries, Unigate applied St Ivel-style painting to some of its wagons, with 50/50 split top/bottom of white top and orange bottom to the tank, and blue St Ivel logo to one end. The chassis, ladder and end support frames were all black with white lettering. Preservation A number of milk tank wagons have survived into preservation, not surprising taking into account their recent usage as well as their ability to be redeployed on a typical preservation railway in a number of ancillary tasks when filled with water, i.e. water replenishment tank for steam locomotives; mobile fire tender; application of weed killer to control lineside vegetation.

The small rural community lies on the high plains of the Llano Estacado in West Texas. The town site was chosen as the original location of Post City, a model community and social experiment conceived by C. W. Post, an American breakfast cereal and foods manufacturer.Julius A. Amin, \\"Close City, TX,\\" Handbook of Texas Online, http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hrc72, accessed December 31, 2011, Published by the Texas State Historical Association. In the early 1890s, Post developed a popular caffeine-free coffee substitute called Postum and later made a fortune on breakfast cereals such as Grape Nuts and Post Toasties.Charles D. Eaves and C. A. Hutchinson. 1952. Post City, Texas. Austin: Texas State Historical Association, 171 pp. As Post's wealth grew, his interests began to expand into other areas. One project that had always intrigued him was the creation of a planned community of model homes and industry. His success in the prepared-foods industry provided the financial resources to begin this project. C. W. Post initially chose a site on the high plains of the Llano Estacado for his projected settlement.Donald R. Abbe and Paul H. Carlson. 2008. Historic Garza County: an Illustrated History. San Antonio: Historical Pub. Network, p. 23. Construction of Post City began at the original site until surveyors discovered that the town was from the geographical center of Garza County. State law required a county seat to be located no more than from the center of a county, thus the chosen site could not serve as county seat. Post ordered work to stop and he shifted resources to a site located nearer the center of the county. The new site, located below the Caprock, is the present-day location of Post, Texas. The original town site, called Ragtown, was renamed Close City, named after Post's son-in-law, Edward Bennett \\"E.B.\\" Close, who married his daughter Marjorie Merriweather Post in 1905.Recorded Texas Historic Landmark: Old Close City School, erected in 1968 by the Texas Historical Commission, marker number 3710. Although some residents stayed, the town developed slowly and consequently remained a small rural community. Today, Close City is primarily a farming community. The primary crop is cotton, but lesser amounts of grain sorghum and winter wheat are also grown in the area. Crops are grown on a mixture of irrigated and dryland farms. Water for irrigation is pumped from the underlying Ogallala Aquifer and is usually applied using center-pivot irrigation systems. The Ogallala Aquifer is quickly becoming depleted, so sometime in the future, all farms may have to revert to dryland agriculture. In 1909, Close City students attended school in a one-room wooden schoolhouse. In 1919, George Samson and Jimmie Napier built a new brick schoolhouse, which served the community well until 1965, when Close City School was consolidated with Post schools.Linda Puckett. 2010. Images of America: Garza County. Arcadia Publishing, p. 39. The only paved road that passes through Close City is Farm to Market Road 399. Close City is north of U.S. Highway 380 and west of U.S. Highway 84. The BNSF Railway, which extends from Post to Lubbock, passes to the east.

Built in 1872, it is one of the city's more prominent examples of high-style architecture. Born near Tiffin, Ohio in 1830, Joseph R. Bartlett moved to Lower Sandusky (now Fremont) in 1833 with his family. After reading law under his father, young Bartlett entered the legal profession and soon became one of Sandusky County's leading citizens. By the early 1870s, he and his wife Rachel had become sufficiently prosperous to erect a grand house on Park Avenue south of the Sandusky County Courthouse.Owen, Lorrie K., ed.

Many distinctive architectural elements characterize their house, including peaked dormers on the mansard roof, a large tower on one corner, ornate carvings on the porch, detailed hood molding, and an elaborate set of carvings and plaster work on the interior. Even the doorways are distinctive: few Fremont houses feature an entrance through a corner tower in the manner of the Bartlett House. After the Bartletts moved out of the house, it was used by multiple other parties; among the most prominent occupants were Sardis and Margaret Cole and the First United Methodist Church, and it is now used as offices by a local lawyer, Jim Ellis.Experience , Jim Ellis for Mayor, 2011. Accessed 2012-01-22. In 1990, the Bartlett House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its historically significant architecture. Among the most important elements of its design is the general style: the majority of houses in the city are contemporary with the Bartlett House, but they are generally smaller vernacular buildings; the architect-designed high style of the Bartlett House presents a strong contrast to the typical Fremont residence. Among the exceptions to this pattern is the Frederick Fabing House; located across the street from the Bartlett House, it features an even more distinctive Second Empire facade.

The film explores the phenomenon of climate change denial. Content Greedy Lying Bastards investigates the climate change misinformation campaign waged by the petroleum industry and its funded think tanks. The film exposes how a small number of well-paid spokespeople have worked to confuse the public and lawmakers on the issue. Both ExxonMobil and Koch Industries are identified in the film as two of the worst culprits funding the denial campaign. In addition to exposing the denial campaign, Greedy Lying Bastards tells the stories of those currently impacted by changing climate. These include residents of Kivalina, Alaska who are faced with relocation due to erosion of shorelines caused from rising temperatures and those in Tuvalu facing sea level rise.

Midnight Marquee Press. Page 55 Plot John Warner is a soldier for the Confederate States of America. When he receives a message that his lover is about to deliver a child he becomes a deserter. On his way to her he is captured and brought before a tribunal. Yet two old friends make sure he can escape. He makes it to the town where he expects his lover to be. Only is he too late too marry her because she's died in the meantime. He tries to take care of his child as a single father but the citizens of this town aren't supportive and thus another tragedy takes place. The love of army deserter John Warner dies at deliverance and their baby child perishes after its grandfather, the landowner Sandoval, rejects it. Warner forms a feared outlaw gang with of two fellow deserters, one runaway lay brother, and some outlaws that join along the way. The local ranchers call in the army for protection, but except for an episode where Warner refuses to make a woman a hostage for money, we mainly see the gang harass Sandoval.

Canada In Canada, more than 20,000 people died from 1847 to 1848, with many quarantined in fever sheds in Grosse Isle, Montreal, Kingston, Toronto and Saint John. =Grosse Isle= Grosse Isle, Quebec is an island in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, home to a quarantine station set up in 1832 to contain a cholera epidemic, and home to thousands of Irish emigrants from 1832 to 1848. On 17 May 1847, the first vessel, the Syria, arrived with 430 fever cases. This was followed by eight more ships a few days later. Dr Douglas wrote that he had 'not a bed to lay [the invalids] on… I never contemplated the possibility of every vessel arriving with fever as they do now'. One week later seventeen more vessels had appeared at Grosse Isle. By this time, 695 people were already in hospital. Only two days afterwards the number of vessels reached thirty, with 10,000 immigrants now waiting to be processed. By 29 May, a total of 36 vessels had arrived. The end of May saw forty ships forming a line two miles (3 km) long down the St. Lawrence River. According to Dr Douglas, each one was affected by fever and dysentery. 1100 invalids were accommodated in sheds and tents, or laid out in rows in the church.Cecil Woodham-Smith: The Great Hunger – Ireland 1845–1849, published by Penguin Books, 1991 edition Dr. George Douglas, Grosse Isle's chief medical officer, recorded that by midsummer of 1847 the quarantine regulations in force were 'physically impossible' to carry out, making it necessary for the emigrants to stay on board their ships for many days. Douglas believed that washing and airing out the ships would be enough to stop the contagion spreading between infected passengers. With the arrival of thousands of emigrants, the island was quickly overwhelmed. Tents were set up to house the influx of people, but many new arrivals were left lying on the ground without shelter. Robert Whyte records seeing 'hundreds… literally flung on the beach, left amid the mud and stones to crawl on the dry land as they could'. The Anglican Bishop of Montreal, Bishop Mountain, recalled seeing people lying opposite the church screaming for water, while others lay inside the tents without bedding. One child he saw was covered in vermin; another who had 'been walking with some others, sat down for a moment, and died'. Many children were orphaned. Because of the lack of space on Grosse Isle, Dr. Douglas required healthy passengers to stay on ship for fifteen days once the sick had been removed, by way of quarantine. Infection flourished on board the ships. One ship, the Agnes, reached Grosse Isle with 427 passengers of whom only 150 survived the quarantine period. Robert Whyte, pseudonymous author of the 1847 Famine Ship Diary: The Journey of a coffin ship,Robert Whyte's 1847 Famine Ship Diary: The Journey of an Irish Coffin Ship, published by Mercier Press, 1994 described how on arrival at Grosse Isle the Irish emigrant passengers on the Ajax dressed in their best clothes and helped the crew to clean the ship, expecting to be sent either to hospital or on to Quebec after their long voyage. In fact, the doctor inspected them only briefly and did not return for several days. By midsummer, 2500 invalids were quarantined on Grosse Isle, and the line of waiting ships stretched several miles. At the end of July, Dr. Douglas abandoned the quarantine regulations because they were 'impossible' to enforce and doctors were examining their charges very perfunctorily, allowing them to walk past and examining the tongues of any who looked feverish. In this way, many people with latent fever were allowed to pass as healthy, only to succumb to their sickness once they had left Grosse Isle. On July 29, 1847, Whyte recorded the neglect of his fellow passengers, who 'within reach of help' 'were to be left enveloped in reeking pestilence, the sick without medicine, medical skill, nourishment, or so much as a drop of pure water'. However, conditions on other Irish emigrant ships were still worse. Two Canadian priests who visited the Ajax described the holds of other vessels where they had been 'up to their ankles in filth. The wretched emigrants crowded together like cattle and corpses remain[ed] long unburied'. Whyte contrasted this with the condition of German immigrants arriving at Grosse Isle. These were all free of sickness, 'comfortably and neatly clad, clean and happy'. The Times also commented on the 'healthy, robust and cheerful' Germans. Fever sheds were filthy and crowded, with patients lying in double tiers of bunks which allowed dirt from the top bunk to fall onto the lower. According to the Senate Committee's report, two or three invalids would be placed together in one berth, irrespective of age or sex. There was no bread: meals consisted of tea, gruel or broth served three times a day.The Grosse Île Tragedy by J. Jordan, 1909 As drinking water was carted, there was never enough for the fever patients. One Catholic priest, Father Moylan, reported giving water to invalids in a tent who had not been able to drink for 18 hours.Quebec Gazette, July 23, 1847 The sheds were not originally intended to house fever patients and had no ventilation; new sheds were built without privies. The Senate Committee stated that because of the lack of personnel and space, the invalids lay in their own excrement for days and there were insufficient staff to take away those who died during the night. The hospitals themselves had very little equipment and planks for bedding were not always available, meaning that it was spread on the ground and became soaked. As well as a shortage of accommodation, there was a serious lack of medical personnel to care for the sick. Dr. Douglas attempted to enlist nurses from among the healthy female passengers with the promise of high wages, but fear of disease meant none accepted. Nurses were expected to sleep alongside the sick and share their food; they had no privacy, often caught the fever themselves and were not helped when they fell ill. Prisoners from the local jail were released to carry out the nursing, but many stole from the dead and the dying. All of the medical officers involved became ill at some stage, with four doctors dying of typhus. Under the Passenger Act of 1842, ships were not obliged to carry a doctor, and only two doctors arrived as passengers. One of these was a Dr. Benson from Dublin, a man with experience working in fever hospitals in Ireland. He arrived on 21 May, volunteered to help the sick, contracted typhus himself and was dead within six days. More than forty Irish and French Canadian priests and Anglican clergymen were active on Grosse Isle, many becoming ill themselves. The Chief Pastor, Bishop Power, contracted fever and died after delivering the last sacraments to a dying woman in September.The Voyage of the Naparima by James Magnan, published by Carraig Books in 1982. The exact numbers of those who died at sea is unknown, although Whyte himself estimated it at 5293. During the crossing itself, bodies were thrown into the sea, but once the ships had reached Grosse Isle they were kept in the hold until a burial on land became possible. The dead were dragged out of the holds with hooks and 'stacked like cordwood' on the shore.The Great Shame by Thomas Keneally, published by Vintage in 1999 On 29 July 1847 Whyte described 'a continuous line of boats, each carrying its freight of dead to the burial ground… Some had several corpses so tied up in canvas that the stiff, sharp outline of death was easily traceable'. Even those passengers who escaped typhus and other diseases were weakened by the journey. The Senate Committee of the United States on Sickness and Mortality in Emigrant Ships described the newly disembarked emigrants as 'cadaverous' and 'feeble'. Most had been misled by passage-brokers into believing that they would be provided with food on the ship. =Montreal= In Montreal, between 3,500 and 6,000 Irish immigrants died of typhus or \\"ship fever\\" in fever sheds in a quarantine area known as Windmill Point in 1847 and 1848. The immigrants had been transferred from quarantine in Grosse Isle, Quebec. Due to a lack of suitable preparations, typhus soon reached epidemic proportions in Montreal. Three fever sheds were initially constructed, long by 40 to wide. As thousands more sick immigrants landed, more sheds had to be erected. The number of sheds would grow to 22, with troops cordoning off the area so the sick could not escape. Grey Nuns cared for the sick, carrying women and children in their arms from ships to the ambulances. According to Montreal journalist and historian Edgar Andrew Collard, thirty of 40 nuns who went to help became ill, with seven dying. Other nuns took over, but once the surviving Grey Nuns had convalesced, they returned. Priests also helped, many falling ill after hearing the last confessions of the dying. When a mob threatened to throw the fever sheds into the river, Montreal mayor John Easton Mills quelled the riot and provided care, giving patients water and changing bedding. He died in November, serving less than a year in office. The Roman Catholic Bishop of Montreal urged French Québécois to help their fellow Catholics. Many travelled to Montreal from the countryside to adopt children, in some cases passing their land on to them. Workers constructing the Victoria Bridge across the St. Lawrence River discovered a mass grave in Windmill Point with victims of the epidemic. The men, many of whom were of Irish descent, were unsettled by the discovery and created a memorial, known as The Black Rock to ensure the gravesite would not be forgotten.McMahon, Colin. \\"Montreal's Ship Fever Monument: An Irish Famine Memorial in the Making\\" The Canadian Journal of Irish Studies Vol. 33, No. 1, Ireland and Quebec / L'Irlande et le Québec (Spring, 2007), pp. 48–60Montreal Irish walk in remembrance of coffin ship victims Irish Central, July 23, 2009. Retrieved on February 06, 2011. Erected on December 1, 1859, the inscription on the stone reads: > \\"To Preserve from Desecration the Remains of 6000 Immigrants Who died of > Ship Fever A.D. 1847-48 This Stone is erected by the Workmen of Messrs. > Peto, Brassey and Betts Employed in the Construction of the Victoria Bridge > A.D. 1859\\" =Toronto= In Toronto, during the summer of 1847, 863 Irish immigrants died of typhus at fever sheds built by the Toronto Board of Health at the northwest corner of King and John Street. There were at least 12 sheds, 22 metres long by 7.5 metres wide. The epidemic also killed the first Bishop of Toronto, Michael Power, while providing care and ministering to Irish immigrants fleeing the Great Famine. =Saint John, New Brunswick= Partridge Island, New Brunswick, just outside the main harbour of Saint John, was chosen as the location for a pest house and quarantine station as far back as 1785. In 1847, with a large influx of Irish migrants, the typhus epidemic quickly filled the fever shed with sick and dying. By the 1847 typhus season, 2115 people had died in New Brunswick, with 1196 dying at Partridge Island and in Saint John. =Bytown (Ottawa)= The typhus outbreak hit Bytown with the arrival of over 3,000 Irish immigrants. The fever first appeared in June 1847, with the sick initially cared for by the Grey Nuns. However, as the numbers of sick swelled, fever sheds had to be erected. Approximately 200 died in quarantine. The Rideau Canal was shut down to prevent further spread of the outbreak. =Kingston= Those stricken while passing through Kingston, Ontario found shelter in makeshift \\"immigrant sheds\\" erected near the waterfront. Despite the efforts of local religious and charitable organisations, notably the Sisters of the Religious Hospitallers of St. Joseph and the Female Benevolent Society, some 1,400 immigrants died. They were buried near the present-day Kingston General Hospital, with their remains re-interred to St. Mary's Cemetery in 1966. United States =New York City= An influx of Irish immigrants to New York resulted in a typhus outbreak in 1847, with 80% of the cases reported to have been contracted during the Atlantic crossing, and 20% of the cases resulting from secondary spread in the city. 147 cases were treated at the New York Hospital over a seven-week period. The mortality rate was 11%.

The project is run by the European Bioinformatics Institute, and was launched in 2009 using the Ensembl technology. The main objective of the Ensembl Genomes database is to complement the main Ensembl database by introducing five additional web pages to include genome data for bacteria, fungi, invertebrate metazoa, plants, and protists. For each of the domains, the Ensembl tools are available for manipulation, analysis and visualization of genome data. Most Ensembl Genomes data is stored in MySQL relational databases and can be accessed by the Ensembl REST interface, the Perl API, Biomart or online. Ensembl Genomes is an open project, and most of the code, tools, and data are available to the public. Ensembl and Ensembl Genomes software uses an Apache 2.0 license license.  Displaying genomic data  Karyotype visualisation in Ensembl Genomes The key feature of Ensembl Genomes is its graphical interface, which allows users to scroll through a genome and observe the relative location of features such as conceptual annotation (e.g. genes, SNP loci), sequence patterns (e.g. repeats) and experimental data (e.g. sequences and external sequence features mapped onto the genome). Graphical views are available for varying levels of resolution from an entire karyotype, down to the sequence of a single exon. Information for a genome is spread over four tabs, a species page, a ‘Location’ tab, a ‘Gene’ tab and a ‘Transcript’ tab, each providing information at a higher resolution. Searching for a particular species using Ensembl Genomes redirects to the species page. Often, a brief description of the species is provided, as well as links to further information and statistics about the genome, the graphical interface and some of the tools available. A karyotype is available for some species in Ensembl Genomes. If the karyotype is available there will be a link to it in the Gene Assembly section of the species page. Alternatively if users are in the ‘Location’ tab they can also view the karyotype by selecting ‘Whole genome’ in the left-hand menu. Users can click on a location within the karyotype to zoom in to one specific chromosome or a genomic region. This will open the ‘Location’ Tab. In the 'Location' tab, users can browse genes, variations, sequence conservation, and other types of annotation along the genome. The 'Region in detail' is highly configurable and scalable, and users can choose what they want to see by clicking on the 'Configure this page' button at the bottom of the left-hand menu. By adding and removing tracks users will be able to select the type of data they want to have included in the displays. Data from the following categories can be easily added or removed from this 'Location' tab view: 'Sequence and assembly', 'Genes and transcripts', 'mRNA and protein alignments', 'Other DNA alignments', 'Germline variation', 'Comparative genomics', among others. Users can also change the display options such as the width. A further option allows users to reset the configuration back to the default settings. More specific information about a select gene can be found in the ‘Gene’ tab. Users can get to this page by searching for desired gene in the search bar and clicking on the gene ID or by clicking on one of the genes shown in the ‘Location’ tab view. The ‘Gene’ tab contains gene-specific information such as gene structure, number of transcripts, position on the chromosome and homology information in the form of gene trees. This information can be accessed via the menu on the left-hand side. A 'Transcript' tab will also appear when a user chooses to view a gene. The 'Transcript' tab contains much of the same information as the 'Gene' tab, however it is focused on only one transcript. Tools =Adding Custom tracks to Ensembl Genomes= Ensembl Genomes allows comparing and visualising user data while browsing karyotypes and genes. Most Ensembl Genomes views include an ‘Add your data’ or ‘Manage your data’ button that will allow the user to upload new tracks containing reads or sequences to Ensembl Genomes or to modify data that has been previously uploaded. The uploaded data can be visualised in region views or over the whole karyotype. The uploaded data can be localised using Chromosome Coordinates or BAC Clone Coordinates. The following methods can be used to upload a data file to any Ensembl Genomes page: # Files smaller than 5 MB can be either uploaded directly from any computer or from a web location (URL) to the Ensembl servers. # Lager files can only be uploaded from web locations (URL). # BAM files can only be uploaded using the URL-based approach. The index file (.bam.bai) should be located in the same webserver. # A Distributed Annotation System source can be attached from web locations. The following file types are supported by Ensembl Genomes: Visualisation of a custom track labelled \\"Reads\\" in Ensembl Genomes * BED * BedGraph * Generic * GFF/GTF * PSL * WIG * BAM * BigBed * BigWig * VCF The data is uploaded temporarily into the servers. Registered users can log in and save their data for future reference. It is possible to share and access the uploaded data using and an assigned URL. Users are also allowed to delete their custom tracks from Ensembl Genomes. =BioMart= BioMart is a programming free search engine incorporated in Ensembl and Ensembl Genomes (except for Ensembl Bacteria) for the purpose of mining and extracting genomic data from the Ensembl databases in table formats like HTML, TSV, CSV or XLS. Release 45 (2019) of Ensembl Genomes has the following data available at the BioMarts: * Ensembl Protists BioMart: includes 33 species and variations for Phytophthora infestans and Phaeodactylum tricornutum * Ensembl Fungi BioMart: includes 56 species and variations for Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium oxysporum, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Puccinia graminis, Verticillium dahliae, Zymoseptoria tritici, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae * Ensembl Metazoa BioMart: includes 78 species and variations for Aedes aegypti, Anopheles gambiae and Ixodes scapularis * Ensembl Plants: includes 67 species and variations for Arabidopsis thaliana, Brachypodium distachyon, Hordeum vulgare, Oryza glaberrima, Oryza glumipatula, Oryoza sativa indica, Oryza sativa japonica, Solanum lycopersicum, Sorghum bicolor, Triticum aestivum, Vitis vinifera, and Zea mays BioMart view in Ensembl Plants. The purpose of the BioMarts in Ensembl Genomes is to allow the user to mine and download tables containing all the genes for a single species, genes in a specific region of a chromosome or genes on one region of a chromosome associated with an InterPro domain. The BioMarts also include filters to refine the data to be extracted and the attributes (Variant ID, Chromosome name, Ensembl ID, location, etc.) that will appear in the final table file can be selected by the user. The BioMarts can be accessed online in each corresponding domain of Ensembl Genomes or the source code can be installed in UNIX environment from the BioMart git repository =BLAST= A BLAST interface is provided to allow users to search for DNA or protein sequences against the Ensembl Genomes. It can be accessed by the header, located on top of all Ensembl Genome pages, titled BLAST. The BLAST search can be configured to search against individual species or collections of species (maximum of 25). There is a taxonomic browser to allow the selection of taxonomically related species. =Sequence Search= Ensembl Genomes provides a second sequence search tool, that uses an algorithm based on Exonerate, that is provided by European Nucleotide Archive. This tool can be accessed by the header, located on top of all Ensembl Genome pages, titled Sequence Search. Users can then choose whether they would like Exonerate to search against all species in the Ensembl Genomes division or against all species in Ensembl Genomes. They can also choose the 'Maximum E-value', which will limit the results that appear to those with E-values below the maximum. Finally users can choose to use an alternative search mode by selecting 'Use spliced query'. =Variant Effect Predictor= The Variant Effect Predictor is one of the most used tools in Ensembl and Ensembl Genomes. It allows to explore and analyse what is the effect that the variants (SNPs, CNVs, indels or structural variations) have on a particular gene, sequence, protein, transcript or transcription factor. To use VEP, the users must input the location of their variants and the nucleotide variations to generate the following results: * Genes and transcripts affected by the variant * Location of the variants * How the variant affects the protein synthesis (e.g. generating a stop codon) *Comparison with other databases to find equal known variants There are two ways in which the users can access the VEP. The first form is online-based. In this page, the user generates an input by selection the following parameters: # Species to be compared. The default database for comparison is Ensembl Transcripts, but for some species, other sources can be selected. # Name for the uploaded data (this is optional, but it will make easier to identify the data if many VEP jobs have been performed) # Selection of the input format for the data. If an incorrect file format is selected, VEP will throw an error when running. # Fields for data upload. Users can upload data from their computers, from an URL-based location or by copying directly their contents into a text box. Data upload to VEP supports VCF, pileup, HGVS notations and a default format. The default format is a whitespace-separated file that contains the data in columns. The first five columns indicate the chromosome, start location, end location, allele (pair of alleles separated by a '/', with the reference allele first) and the strand (+ for forward or – for reverse). The sixth column is a variation identifier and it is optional. If it is left in blank, VEP will assign an identifier to in output file. VEP also provides additional identifier options to the users, extra options to complement the output and filtering. The filtering options allow features like removal of known variants from results, returning variants in exons only, and restriction of results to specific consequences of the variants. VEP users also have the possibility of viewing and manipulating all the jobs associated with their session by browsing the \\"Recent Tickets\\" tab. I this tab the users can view the status of their search (success, queued, running or failed) and save, delete or resubmit jobs. The second option to use VEP is by downloading the source code for its use in UNIX environments. All the features are equal between the online and script versions. VEP can also be used with online instances like Galaxy. When a VEP job is completed the output is a tabular file that contains the following columns: # Uploaded variation - as chromosome_start_alleles # Location - in standard coordinate format (chr:start or chr:start-end) # Allele - the variant allele used to calculate the consequence # Gene - Ensembl stable ID of affected gene # Feature - Ensembl stable ID of feature # Feature type - type of feature. Currently one of Transcript, RegulatoryFeature, MotifFeature. # Consequence - consequence type of this variation # Position in cDNA - relative position of base pair in cDNA sequence # Position in CDS - relative position of base pair in coding sequence # Position in protein - relative position of amino acid in protein # Amino acid change - only given if the variation affects the protein-coding sequence # Codon change - the alternative codons with the variant base in upper case # Co-located variation - known identifier of existing variation # Extra - this column contains extra information as key=value pairs separated by \\";\\". Displays extra identifiers. Variant Effect Predictor Output file Other common output formats for VEP include JSON and VDF formats. =Programmatic data access= The Ensembl Genomes [REST] interface allows access to the data using your favourite programming language. You can also access data using the Perl API and Biomart.  Current species  Ensembl Genomes makes no attempt to include all possible genomes, rather the genomes that are included on the site are those that are deemed to be scientifically important. Each site contains the following number of species: *The bacterial division of Ensembl now contains all bacterial genomes that have been completely sequenced, annotated and submitted to the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (European Nucleotide Archive, GenBank and the DNA Database of Japan). The current dataset contains 44,048 genomes. *Ensembl Fungi contains 1014 genomes *Ensembl Metazoa contains 78 genomes for invertebrate species. The main Ensembl site contains 236 genomes for vertebrate species. *Ensembl Plants contains 67 genomes *Ensembl Protists contains 237 genomes  Collaborations  Ensembl Genomes continuously expands the annotation data through collaboration with other organisations involved in genome annotation projects and research.

Game rules In Chessence, kings do not move and must remain fixed on their starting squares the entire game. (Thus, a king is unable to move out of check.) A man has capability to move based on its relative position to other friendly men on the board, as follows: * If a man is orthogonally adjacent to a friendly man, then both have the ability to move as a rook in chess. * If a man is diagonally adjacent to a friendly man, then both have the ability to move as a chess bishop. * If a man is a knight's move away from a friendly man, then both have the ability to move as a knight. A man with more than one position relationship has the ability to move in more than one way. Likewise, if a man has no position relationship defined above, that man cannot move. The king has no bearing on how the other men may move. A man may not move to, nor through, a non-existent (blackened-out) square; except that a man moving as a knight may jump over a non-existent square. For a turn, a player may move a man on the board, or alternatively, he may put one of his reserve men in play by placing it on any of his six initial starting squares that is currently open. Checks, checkmate, and captures are as in standard chess. If a player has no legal moves, he loses the game.

The image, a Black Madonna that represents the Immaculate Conception, is enshrined in Antipolo Cathedral in the Sierra Madre mountains east of Metro Manila. The image was brought to the country by Governor-General Juan Niño de Tabora from Mexico via the galleon El Almirante in 1626. His safe voyage across the Pacific Ocean was attributed to the image, which was given the title of \\"Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage\\". It was substantiated later by six other successful voyages of the Manila-Acapulco Galleons with the image aboard as its patroness.\\"Diocese of Antipolo\\" . CBCP Online.\\"Our Lady of Antipolo (Birhen ng Antipolo)\\" . Ministry to Filipinos, Diocese of Orlando. The statue is one of the most celebrated images of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the Philippines, gaining devotees since the mid-19th century, having been mentioned by José Rizal in his writings. From May to July each year, the image attracts millions of pilgrims from all over the country and abroad. Pope Pius XI authorized her canonical coronation on 13 June 1925, which occurred on 28 November 1926. History On 25 March 1626, the galleon trading ship El Almirante left Acapulco, Mexico, carrying the newly appointed Governor-General of the Spanish East Indies, Don Juan Niño de Tabora, who brought with him the statue. He arrived in Manila on 18 July 1626, and the statue was brought to San Ignacio Church of the Jesuits in Intramuros. When Governor Tabora died in 1632, the statue was given to the Jesuits for enshrinement in the church of Antipolo, which was then being built in the present-day barangay Santa Cruz. =Claims of miracles= During construction of the Antipolo church in the 1630s, the image would mysteriously vanish several times from its shrine, only to reappear atop a tipolo (breadfruit tree; Artocarpus incisa). This was taken as a celestial sign, and the church was relocated to where the tipolo tree stood. The image's pedestal is supposedly made from the trunk of that same tipolo tree,\\"Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage\\". Antipolo, Pilgrimage City. Retrieved on 2013-02-22. which also gave its name to Antipolo itself.\\"Antipolo History\\". Antipolo City, the Pilgrimage City. Retrieved on 2013-03-02. In 1639 the Chinese rose in revolt, burning the town and the church. Fearing for the statue's safety, Governor Sebastián Hurtado de Corcuera ordered its transfer to Cavite, where it was temporarily enshrined. Governor Hurtado later ordered the statue removed from its Cavite shrine in 1648, and it was shipped back to Mexico aboard the galleon San Luis. At the time, the statue of a saint onboard served as a ship's patron saint or protector of the Acapulco trade. The statue crossed the Pacific six times aboard the following Manila-Acapulco galleons: * San Luis — (1648–1649) * Encarnación — (1650) * San Diego — (1651–1653) * San Francisco Javier — (1659–1662) * Nuestra Señora del Pilar — (1663) * San José — (1746–1748) A royal decree by Queen Isabella II on 19 May 1864 ordered that the curias of San Nicolas de Tolentino be turned over to the Jesuits in exchange for the curias of Antipolo, Taytay and Morong, which were given to the Augustinian Recollects. The latter order thus came into possession of the image. =World War II and coronation= In 1944, the Japanese Imperial Army invaded the town and turned it into a garrison, with the shrine being used as an arsenal. To save the image, the church's head sacristan, Procopio Ángeles, wrapped it in a thick woollen blanket and placed it in an empty petrol drum, which he then buried in a nearby kitchen. Fighting between Imperial Japanese troops and the combined American and Filipino forces drove Ángeles and other devotees to exhume the image and move it to Kulaiki Hill on the border with Angono. From there, it was spirited away to the lowland Barangay Santolan in Pasig, and then to the town center of Pasig itself. The statue was then kept by Rosario Alejandro (née Ocampo), daughter of Pablo Ocampo, at the Ocampo- Santiago family residence on Hidalgo Street, Quiapo, Manila, before it was enshrined inside Quiapo Church for the remainder of the Second World War. On 15 October 1945, the statue was translated back to its church in Antipolo, where it remains today. The statue was canonically crowned by the Archbishop of Manila, Rev. Michael J. O'Doherty, on 28 November 1926 in Luneta (present- day Rizal Park), Manila. Cathedral shrine The first missionaries in Antipolo were the Franciscans, who arrived in the vicinity in 1578. The Jesuits then followed and administered the church from 1591 until May 1768, when the decree expelling the Jesuits from Spanish lands reached Manila. The church was greatly damaged during the Chinese uprising of 1639, the 1645 Luzon earthquake, and the earthquakes of 1824 and 1883. Notable Filipino historians such as Pedro Chirino and Pedro Murillo Velarde (also a prominent cartographer) ministered at the church. The Diocese of Antipolo was created on 24 January 1983 and was canonically erected on 25 June 1983 at the diocese's new see, which bears the formal title of “National Shrine of Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage-Immaculate Conception Parish”. Pilgrimage Pilgrimages to the image's shrine begin and peak in May, which in Catholicism is dedicated to the Virgin Mary. On 30 April--the eve of May Day--thousands of devotees from Metro Manila customarily perform the Alay Lakad (literally, “Walk Offering”), where pilgrims spend the night travelling on foot to the shrine, where they hear Mass at dawn. The farthest official starting point of the modern pilgrimage is Quiapo Church; the custom of visiting the shrine in May, however, was already recorded by the 19th century. On 6 June 1868, a young José Rizal and his father Don Francisco Mercado, visited the shrine in thanksgiving after the boy and his mother, Teodora Alonso, survived his delivery in 1861. Television In December 2011, the Eternal Word Television Network programme Mary: Mother of the Philippines ran an episode showcasing the statue as the “most traveled Marian icon in the Philippines”.

Burroughs, Jr. (February 22, 1903 – September 23, 1992) was a senior officer in the United States Navy, and the first commander of the Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake originally known as the Naval Ordnance Test Station (NOTS). Early life Sherman Everett Burroughs, Jr., was born in Manchester, New Hampshire, on February 22, 1903, the son of Sherman Everett Burroughs, Sr., lawyer who served as member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives and later United States Congressman, and his wife Helen Sophie née Phillips. Burroughs graduated from the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis with the class of 1924, and became a naval aviator in 1926. He served on the aircraft carriers and from 1927 to 1929, and was senior aviator on the light cruiser between 1933 and 1935, and on the ill- fated battleship from 1938 to 1939. World War II =Pacific Theater= Vice Admiral William F. Halsey, Jr., with his staff. Burroughs is third from the left.

For his services, he was awarded the Silver Star. He subsequently was awarded a second Silver Star for his services on the staff of Rear Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid's Task Force 16 at the Battle of the Eastern Solomons in August 1942. Burroughs became commander of Carrier Air Group Three, flying from the carrier . He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. His citation read: =Naval Ordnance Test Station= Following the usual pattern of alternating sea duty with service ashore, Burroughs's next assignment was the aviation desk at the Bureau of Ordnance in Washington, D.C., in March 1943. Halsey was supportive of this, telling him to \\"Go back and get things straightened out back there! Try to get those guys off the dime!\\" He proposed that a special Naval Ordnance Test Station (NOTS) be established specifically devoted to the development of aircraft weapons, which he had long felt had been neglected by the navy in favor of shipboard weapons, and he nominated himself, as a naval aviator with postgraduate ordnance education, to command it. NOTS was authorised by the Secretary of the Navy, Frank Knox, and in December 1943, Burroughs assumed command of the new station in the Mojave Desert. Burroughs served as commander of the NOTS from December 20, 1943, to August 18, 1945. NOTS assumed responsibility for the development efforts already under way in rockets. Under his command, NOTS worked with the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) on the successful development and testing of the 3.5-inch, 5-inch, HVAR and 11.75-inch (Tiny Tim) rockets. It also supplied support for the Manhattan Project through Project Camel. Nearby Sherman E. Burroughs High School, which opened on September 10, 1945, a month after he left NOTS, was named after him. For his services in command of NOTS, Burroughs was awarded the Legion of Merit. His citation read: In 1957 he received the L.T.E. Thompson award for: Later life Following his tour of command at NOTS, Burroughs commanded the aircraft carrier . He again served at the Bureau of Ordnance in Washington, and at the Naval War College for two years.

He then became an executive with the General Precision Equipment Corporation in New York City and Washington, D.C., from which he retired in 1967. He moved to Coronado, California. He was a volunteer at the Small Business Administration in San Diego, and a weekly visitor to senior citizens at the Coronado Hospital's long-term care facility. Following a series of strokes, he died at the Villa Coronado Care Center in Coronado, on September 23, 1992. He was survived by his wife Katherine, brother Robert and two granddaughters. His body was cremated and his ashes were scattered at sea. Sherman E. Burroughs High school in Ridgecrest, Ca was named after the Rear Admiral.

According to Qian, when the meme first appeared, Qian's teachers and classmates had avoided mentioning the phenomenon in order to not hurt his feelings. When he appeared for an interview with the Shanghai Daily, the newspaper did not disclose his real name in order to protect his privacy. Originally many internet users mistakenly believed that Qian was from Nanning, Guangxi. Originally Qian felt embarrassed by the internet phenomenon, but he said that \\"I have tried to turn sorrow into strength. At least this makes people smile and I have had quite a positive response from many surfers.\\" Qian said that he did not mind the photoshops when they were \\"well- meant\\". He said that he liked it when his face is superimposed on bodies of heroes, such as the character played by Russell Crowe in Gladiator.

Qian decided to take actions to profit from his newfound fame. He contacted Gao Feng, an operator of xiaopang.cn, a website for obese people. Gao confirmed that the e-mail came from Qian, and Gao became Qian's agent and began promoting Qian on his website.

With around 1000 exhibits, the Vienna Funeral Museum gives a comprehensive overview of funeral customs, burial rites, funerary art and the special Viennese perspective on death and provides information on the historical and current funeral services in Vienna.  History and description  When the Austro-Hungarian Empire was at its peak, people paid heavily to make sure they would be remembered. Their obsession of a \\"schöne Leiche\\" (a beautiful corpse) prompted them to save money to ensure their send off was as grand as possible. In Vienna in the 1900s more than eighty private funeral companies competed for the business of burying the city's citizens in one of the 52 cemeteries in the suburban area. In 1951 the Bestattung Wien, or Undertaking Service of Vienna, was appointed as the only funeral company in the city. The museum was founded in 1967 and designed in 1987 by Wittigo Keller. Located in the 4th district at Goldeggasse 19, near the Belvedere, Vienna, it also houses the intriguing Vienna Undertakers' Museum, which contains more than 600 artifacts documenting the Viennese interest in death and burial. There are elaborate black uniforms and regalia worn by the pallbearers, from the French pompes funèbres, as well as hearses, wreaths, sashes, lanterns, torches, black flags, even an urn in the shape of a football and a “sitting coffin”. A real curiosity on display in the Bestattungsmuseum is the re-usable coffin instigated in 1784 by Emperor Joseph II, in an attempt to save wood and to hasten decomposition. The coffins were equipped with a trap underneath to drop the bodies in the graves and kept for another funeral. But the Viennese protests led to the cancellation of the law within six months. With court decree of 29 May 1825, it was decreed that every deceased had to be placed in a sealed coffin before being lowered into the ground. Another curiosity is a device whereby a cord; attached to the hand of the deceased would ring a bell above ground to prevent premature burial, just in case the person wasn't really dead. To avoid this, some Viennese stipulated in their will that after death they should be stabbed in the heart with a sword. To this day, the city's hospital is still occasionally instructed to administer a lethal injection after death to avoid premature burial.  The new location  The museum is located in mortuary 2 The funeral Vienna GmbH has announced its plans to establish a new administration building soon, opposite the Zentralfriedhof on the main street near the cemetery gate 2, in the 11th city district of Simmering and its address is Bestattung Wien 11., Simmeringer Hauptstraße 339, Vienna 1110, Austria.

The street runs from the central Republic Square to the statue of prominent Armenian writer Khachatur Abovian (1809-1848), who the street is named after. Abovyan Street is the first planned street of the Armenian capital. Located at downtown Yerevan, Abovyan Street is mainly home to cultural and educational institutions, luxurious residential buildings, elite brand shops, commercial offices, coffee shops, hotels, restaurants and night clubs. History In 1855, the Russian viceroy of Caucasus confirmed the planning of Yerevan streets. The average width of the streets was planned to be from 6 to 20 meters. Astafayan Street was planned to be 20 meters wide. Astafyan was the first street in Yerevan that was built according to a certain plan. It was opened in 1863 and was named Astafyan after Mikhail Astafyev, the governor of the Erivan Governorate from 1860 to 1862. Avetisyan, Kamsar.

The street was officially called Astafyevskaya (), but the residents of Yerevan called it in their way – changing the suffix \\"-yevskaya\\" to \\"-yan\\". That was the main reason why it was known as Astafyan (), not Astafyevskaya. In 1904, the horsecar system began to be constructed on Abovyan Street and was completed in 1906.

They can, therefore, be classed as hydrogen chalcogenides. The simplest possible stable hydrogen polyoxide (the parent molecule) is water, H2O. The general structure of the class of molecules is some number of oxygen atoms single-bonded to each other in a chain. The oxygen atom at each end of this oxygen skeleton is attached to a hydrogen atom. Thus, these compounds form a homologous series with chemical formula in which the members differ by a constant relative molecular mass of 16 (the mass of each additional oxygen atom). The number of oxygen atoms is used to define the size of the hydrogen polyoxide (e.g., hydrogen pentoxide contains a five-oxygen backbone).

He was the son of a farmer, teacher and cantor. He earned his Ph.D. in 1928 with a dissertation on the tax system in the Middle Ages. From 1933 to 1960 he was the national archivist of Norway. From 1961 he was a statsstipendiat (government scholar). Steinnes was one of the pioneers of the agrarian tradition in the research of Norwegian history research. His major contributions were primarily detailed studies of taxation, property and settlement in earlier times. Insights from them were used to shed light on major historical issues such as the reasons why Norway ceased to be an independent state in the Late Middle Ages, the impact of the Black Death and the growth of royal power. The method of Steinnes was a thorough and exact (quantitative) analysis of place names, land books, legal documents, financial statements and cadastres, etc. His systemic efforts to map the actual dimensions of units of size, weight and money in the Middle Ages became the model for all the subsequent analyses of the economic history of the ancient times. For his work, Steinnes was made the Commander of the Order of the Dannebrog in Denmark in 1948 and the Knight of the Order of St. Olav in 1961 in Norway.(no) Halvard Bjørkvik, “Asgaut Steinnes”.

Influenced by professor of physics and chemistry Elmer Jones, she attended the University of Chicago under C. Judson Herrick and received her Masters of Science in biology in 1912 and then her Ph.D. in anatomy in 1915 via a fellowship. In 1920, Crosby accepted a teaching position in the University of Michigan's department of anatomy under G. Carl Huber; her classes included histology and neuroanatomy. In 1923, Crosby took a sabbatical to work with the renowned scientist C. U. Ariëns Kappers at the Central Institute for Brain Research in Amsterdam. While there, she contributed significantly to The Comparative Anatomy of the Nervous System of Vertebrates (1936). Although Crosby did not have a medical background, she became the first woman to receive full professorship at the University of Michigan Medical School, in 1936 and the first to receive the University's Faculty Achievement Award, given in 1956. In 1939 she took a sabbatical to work with Prof Robert Douglas Lockhart at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland. Due to introduction of war-time trans-Atlantic travel restrictions in the Second World War she unintentionally remained there until 1941. She eventually became Professor Emeritus of Anatomy and Consultant of Neurosurgery before leaving the University of Michigan for University of Alabama at Birmingham in 1963, where she again became Professor Emeritus of Anatomy. She was inducted into the Alabama Women's Hall of Fame in 1987.

Its construction, in the style of the Sicilian Baroque, began in the early 18th century and was completed in 1776. It is dedicated to Saint Nicholas of Myra, and has been the cathedral of the Diocese of Noto since the diocese's establishment in 1844. The cathedral dome collapsed in 1996 as a result of unremedied structural weakening caused by an earthquake in 1990, to which injudicious building alterations in the 1950s may have contributed. It has since been rebuilt, and was reopened in 2007. History Construction of the Church of St Nicholas began in the early 18th century, as part of the general reconstruction in Sicily following the devastating earthquake of 1693. The long interval between the beginning of the building, to designs by Rosario Gagliardi, and its completion in 1776 under the supervision of Bernardo Labisi,son of Francesco Paolo Labisi probably accounts for various peculiarities and inconsistencies of design, and the introduction of Neo- Classical elements. Moreover, the principal doorways are revivals of 15th- century architecture, based on the style of Vignola or Domenico Fontana. The large central window of the west front, with its \\"ears\\" and curvilinear tympanum borrows from the repertoire of Andrea Pozzo and resembles work elsewhere in Noto by Francesco Paolo Labisi (for example, the Chiesa del Carmine). The façade, the composition of which is comparable to those of the church of Notre-Dame, Versailles, and the pre-revolutionary church of Saint- Roch in Paris, was started in late 1767 (the nearby campanile bears the date 1768) to designs of about 1740 by Gagliardi. In the 19th century the dome had to be reconstructed twice, ending up as a Neo-Classical construction, after collapses caused by earthquakes. In the 1950s much refurbishment was carried out, not entirely successfully, for example the trompe-l'oeil of the vertical elements and the tempera decoration of the vaults by the painters Arduino and Baldinelli, as well as major alterations to the high altar and the organ. Most serious however was the replacement of the original pitched roof of the nave by a heavy loft of Roman brick and concrete which was probably one of the causes of the collapse of 1996. Collapse On March 13, 1996, a large part of the cathedral collapsed: four of the piers of the southern side of the nave, one of the four piers supporting the dome, the entire roof and vault of the nave, three quarters of the drum and the dome with the lantern, the roof of the south arm of the transept, with many of the cupolas and much of the roof of the right aisle. The reconstruction was a complex process. Analysis of the debris and the remaining structure made clear how complicated its building history had been, because of the repeated repairs, in a great variety of materials, made necessary by earlier earthquake damage, and also because not all the repairs had been well executed. The task was made all the more onerous by the importance and high visibility of the cathedral in the city of Noto, the so-called capital of Sicilian Baroque architecture. =Reopening and after= Newly Painted Cupola The grand reopening of Noto Cathedral was celebrated by Bishop Giuseppe Malandrino of Noto on June 15, 2007, 11 years after the collapse. Since then, work on the interior decorations and furnishings of the cathedral has continued. The new high altar, lectern, crucifix and organ were all consecrated by Bishop Antonio Staglianò on January 13, 2011, at a ceremony attended by the head of the Civil Protection Department, Francesco Gabrielli, and the highest regional and local authorities, including the Minister for the Environment, Stefania Prestigiacomo, and the Emergency Commissioner for Reconstruction, the Prefect of Siracusa, Carmela Floreno Vacirca. The new altar, lectern and crucifix were made of silvered bronze and Sicilian jasper by the Italian sculptor, Giuseppe Ducrot. As a major part of the ceremony, the frescos in the cupola and pendentives by the Russian painter, Oleg Supereko, were also revealed, as well as the eight new windows in the cupola by Francesco Mori. The Structure =Exterior= Exterior, showing the central dome The exterior is of pale yellow limestone, in the Sicilian Baroque style. In front of the cathedral are four statues of saints on pillars. On the left tower is mounted the church bell, and on the right tower a clock. In the central tower, there is a large window. There are also three doors. Over the crossing is the large central dome. =Interior= Interior The interior is now simply painted white, as the 18th century interior decoration was destroyed in the collapse. The principal features and furnishings are those consecrated on 13 January 2011, as above.

For example, the incidence of cancer in humans is much higher than the incidence of cancer in whales. This is despite the fact that a whale has many more cells than a human. If the probability of carcinogenesis were constant across cells, one would expect whales to have a higher incidence of cancer than humans. Original formulation Peto, a statistical epidemiologist at the University of Oxford, first formulated the paradox in 1977. Writing an overview of the multistage model of cancer, Peto noted that, on a cell-for- cell basis, humans were much less susceptible to cancer than mice: Peto went on to suggest that evolutionary considerations were likely responsible for varying per-cell carcinogenesis rates across species.  Evidence  Within members of the same species, cancer risk and body size appear to be positively correlated, even once other risk factors are controlled for. A 25-year longitudinal study of 17,738 male British civil servants, published in 1998, showed a positive correlation between height and cancer incidence with a high degree of statistical confidence, even after risk factors like smoking were controlled for. A similar 2011 study of more than one million British women found strong statistical evidence of a relationship between cancer and height, even after controlling for a number of socioeconomic and behavioral risk factors. A 2011 analysis of the causes of death of 74,556 domesticated North American dogs found that cancer incidence was lowest in the smaller breeds, confirming the results of earlier studies. Across species, however, the relationship breaks down. A 2015 study, using data from necropsies performed by the San Diego Zoo, surveyed results from 36 different mammalian species, ranging in size from the 51-gram striped grass mouse to the 4,800-kilogram elephant, nearly 100,000 times larger. The study found no relationship between body size and cancer incidence, offering empirical support for Peto's initial observation. Evolutionary considerations The evolution of multicellularity has required the suppression of cancer to some extent, and connections have been found between the origins of multicellularity and cancer. In order to build larger and longer-lived bodies, organisms required greater cancer suppression. Evidence suggests that large organisms such as elephants have more adaptations that allow them to evade cancer. The reason that intermediate-sized organisms have relatively few of these genes may be because the advantage of preventing cancer these genes conferred was, for moderately- sized organisms, outweighed by their disadvantages—particularly reduced fertility. Various species have evolved different mechanisms for suppressing cancer. A paper in Cell Reports in January 2015 claimed to have found genes in the bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) that may be associated with longevity. Around the same time, a second team of researchers identified a polysaccharide in the naked mole-rat that appeared to block the development of tumors. In October 2015, two independent studies showed that elephants have 20 copies of tumor suppressor gene TP53 in their genome, where humans and other mammals have only one. Additional research showed 14 copies of the gene present in the DNA of preserved mammoths, but only one copy of the gene in the DNA of manatees and hyraxes, the elephant's closest living relatives. The results suggest an evolutionary relationship between animal size and tumor suppression, as Peto had theorized. Metabolic and cell size considerations A 2014 paper in Evolutionary Applications by Maciak and Michalak emphasized what they termed \\"a largely underappreciated relation of cell size to both metabolism and cell-division rates across species\\" as key factors underlying the paradox, and concluded that \\"larger organisms have bigger and slowly dividing cells with lower energy turnover, all significantly reducing the risk of cancer initiation.\\" Maciak and Michalak argue that cell size is not uniform across mammalian species, making body size an imperfect proxy for the number of cells in an organism. (For example, the volume of an individual red blood cell of an elephant is roughly four times that of one from a common shrew). Furthermore, larger cells divide more slowly than smaller ones, a difference which compounds exponentially over the life-span of the organism. Fewer cell divisions means fewer opportunities for cancer mutations, and mathematical models of cancer incidence are highly sensitive to cell-division rates. Additionally, larger animals generally have lower basal metabolic rates, following a well-defined inverse logarithmic relationship. Consequently, their cells will incur less damage over time per unit of body mass. Combined, these factors may explain much of the apparent paradox. Medical research The apparent ability of bigger animals to suppress cancer across very large numbers of cells has spurred an active field of medical research. In one experiment, laboratory mice were genetically altered to express \\"always-on\\" active TP53 tumor antigens, similar to the ones found in elephants. The mutated mice exhibited increased tumor suppression ability, but also showed signs of premature aging. Another study placed p53 under normal regulatory control and did not find signs of premature aging. It is assumed that under its native promoter p53 does not cause premature aging, unlike constitutively expressed p53.

An arm of the Tasman Sea, the bay lies northwest of Tasman Bay and Cook Strait. It is protected in the north by Farewell Spit, a 26 km long arm of fine golden sand that is the country's longest sandspit. The Aorere and Tākaka Rivers flow into the bay from the south. It is part of the Tasman Region, one of the territorial authorities of New Zealand. The bay was once a resting area for migrating whales and dolphins such as southern right whales and humpback whales, and pygmy blue whales may be observed off the bay as well.Torres G. L.. 2013. Evidence for an unrecognised blue whale foraging ground in New Zealand. New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research 47(2). ResearchGate. Retrieved on 3 March 2017 The west and northern regions of the bay are largely unpopulated. Along its southern coast are the towns of Tākaka and Collingwood, and the Abel Tasman National Park. Separation Point, the natural boundary between Golden and Tasman Bays, is in the park. North-eastern parts of Kahurangi National Park are in Golden Bay. It is known for being a popular tourist destination, because of its good weather and relaxed, friendly lifestyle. Beaches such as Tata Beach are popular locations for retirees and holiday homes. History Māori lived along the shores of Golden Bay from at least 1450, which is the earliest dated archaeological evidence (from carbon dating) yet found. In 2010 an extensive scientific study was made of Golden Bay by a team from Otago University led by Associate Professor Ian Barber. They accurately plotted and investigated a large number of early Māori sites ranging from pā to kāinga to probable kumara gardens that stretch along the coastal arc from the base of Farewell Spit at Triangle Flat, 60 km eastwards to a pā site 10 km east of Separation Point. The iwi who occupied this area in 1642 were the Ngāti Tūmatakōkiri from the North Island. Abel Tasman entering the bay Dutch explorer Abel Tasman anchored in this bay in 1642. Ngāti Tūmatakōkiri rammed the Dutch ship's cockboat with a waka and four Dutch seamen were killed by Māori, prompting Tasman to name it Moordenaar's Bay (Murderers Bay). Archeological research has shown the Dutch had tried to land at a major agricultural area, which the Māori may have been trying to protect. Barber postulated that the iwi may have been insecure in their control of the bay and its resources because of their own relatively recent arrival. Little is known of the history of Ngāti Tūmatakōkiri people as they were extinguished by a Māori invasion during the Musket Wars about 1823.Musket Wars R. Crosby p 21.Current Anthropology. Vol 53, No 6. Dec 2012. Garden of Rongo. I Barber. University of Otago. In 1642 Tasman saw at least 22 waka. He recorded that of the 11 waka that chased his ship, most had 17 men on board. This gives a total of about 200 men, with a likely population of about 500 people. Tasman had already been in the bay five days when attacked giving the Māori time to assemble an attack force. Archaeological evidence has not shown any large settlements so it is likely that the iwi normally lived in whanau based groups scattered along the coast but mainly in the eastern bay at Ligar Beach, Tata Beach and Wainui Bay where there are 20 known archaeological sites in a 10 km zone. In 1770, during his first voyage, English explorer James Cook included the bay as part of Blind Bay, but upon his second voyage to the bay in 1773 realised that it was in fact the location of Murderers Bay. The French explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville appears to have changed the name to Massacre Bay. European settlement commenced in October 1842 with the Lovell family settling at Motupipi near the then existing Māori pa site. Prior to the Lovell's settling, in March of that year a Mr Tuckett had discovered coal on the beach near the Motupipi pa.Discovery of coal and freestone, Nelson Examiner and New Zealand Chronicle, Volume I, Issue 4, 2 April 1842, Page 15 There was a report from May 1841, which also stated there was coal in the area.Commercial prospects of New Zealand, New Zealand Gazette and Wellington Spectator, Volume II, Issue 59, 29 May 1841, Page 3 In the 1840s, following the discoveries, the local population unsuccessfully sought to have it renamed Coal Bay.Auckland Extracts, Nelson Examiner and New Zealand Chronicle, Volume VI, Issue 287, 4 September 1847, Page 105 Then, in the late 1850s, with the discovery of gold at Aorere, its name was changed to Golden Bay.Advertisements, Colonist, Volume II, Issue 172, 14 June 1859, Page 2 In the Great Depression, miners returned to search for any remaining gold in a government-subsidised prospecting scheme for the unemployed, and about 40 miners lived in a dozen huts around Waingaro Forks. In December 2011 the bay, as well as much of the Nelson/Tasman region, was hit by heavy rain and flooding. This affected many homes around the Pohara/Ligar Bay/Tata Beach/Wainui area. The road to Totaranui, a popular isolated tourist destination in Tasman Bay, was badly damaged and was reopened on 29 June 2012.

Under the commission of Cardinal Antonio Francesco Sanvitale and a donation by Pope Clement XIII, in the 1700s the church was rebuilt to designs of the architect and decorator Ferdinando Galli-Bibiena. The church was reconsecrated in 1766. Art The interior contains decorations by the Paremesan painters Gaetano Ghidetti and Antonio Bresciani; the ceiling frescoes of Angels and the Apotheosis of St. Anthony and the main altarpiece are by Giuseppe Peroni. The chapels contain paintings by Pompeo Batoni (John the Baptist Preaching), by Giovanni Gottardi, (St Peter Escapes), and by Giambettino Cignaroli (Flight to Egypt). The painting by Correggio, Madonna of St Jerome, was painted for this church. It had been removed to the Ducal palace by the 18th century, then looted and taken to Paris in 1796, but returned in 1814 and now is in Galleria nazionale di Parma.

Known especially for her white-line woodcuts, she was an early modernist American artist, bringing elements of Cubism and abstraction into her art. Born in a small farming community in West Virginia, Lazzell traveled to Europe twice, studying in Paris with French artists Albert Gleizes, Fernand Léger, and André Lhote. In 1915, she began spending her summers in the Cape Cod art community of Provincetown, Massachusetts, and eventually settled there permanently. She was one of the founding members of the Provincetown Printers, a group of artists who experimented with a white- line woodcut technique based on the Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints. Biography =Early life and education= Nettie Blanche Lazzell was born on a farm near Maidsville, West Virginia, to Mary Prudence Pope and Cornelius Carhart Lazzell. Her father was a direct descendant of Reverend Thomas and Hannah Lazzell, pioneers who settled in Monongalia County after the American Revolutionary War.Doll, 2 The Lazzells were devout Methodists, attending the Bethel Methodist Episcopal Church. The ninth of ten children, she was nicknamed \\"Pet\\" by her older brother Rufus, a name that her family would continue to use throughout her life. She grew up on the 200 acre (0.81 km2) family farm, attending a one-room schoolhouse on the property where students from the first through eighth grades were taught from October through February. Her mother died when she was twelve.Doll, 3 When Lazzell was fifteen, she enrolled in the West Virginia Conference Seminary (now West Virginia Wesleyan College) in Buckhannon.Doll, 4 Probably sometime prior to her entering the Seminary she became partially deaf, although the exact origin of her condition is unclear. In 1894 she sought treatment from a Baltimore doctor who blamed her deafness on catarrh. In 1899, Lazzell enrolled in the South Carolina Co-educational Institute. Upon graduation later that year, she became a teacher at the Red Oaks School in Ramsey, South Carolina. In spring of 1900, she returned to Maidsville, where she tutored her younger sister, Bessie.Doll, 9 Lazzell was matriculated into the West Virginia University (WVU) in 1901 and decided to study fine art. While her education was paid for by her father, she kept a strict account of her expenditures and took a job coloring photographs at Frieds, a studio in Morgantown. She took drawing and art history classes from William J. Leonard and studied with Eva E. Hubbard. In June 1905 Lazzell was graduated, earning her degree in fine arts. She continued to study at WVU off and on until 1909, furthering her art studies and twice substituting as a painting teacher for Hubbard.Doll, 13 During this time she learned ceramics, gold etching, and china decoration. She enrolled in the Art Students League of New York in 1908 where she studied under painters Kenyon Cox and William Merritt Chase. Georgia O'Keeffe attended the league during the same period, but it is not clear whether the two attended classes together.Doll, 15 In 1908, Lazzell's father died and she left the Art Students League. =Travels to Europe= Lazzell boarded the SS Ivernia on July 3, 1912, bound for Europe on a summer tour arranged by the American Travel Club.Doll, 16 The tour began in England and continued through the Netherlands, Belgium, and Italy, where Lazzell studied the architecture of churches. In August she left the tour and traveled to Paris, where she stayed at a pension in Montparnasse on the Left Bank. She attended lectures by Florence Heywood and Rossiter Howard, avoided the cafe life, and joined the Students Hostel on Boulevard Saint-Michel. While in Paris, Lazzell took classes at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière, Académie Julian, and Académie Delécluse, eventually settling in at the Académie Moderne where she studied with post-impressionist painter Charles Guérin and David Rosen.Doll, 20 Lazzell felt most comfortable at the Moderne, which was associated with the Parisian avant-garde. She embarked upon a six-week sketching tour of Italy with four other young women in February 1913. The quintet returned to Paris via Germany where Lazzell partook in her first glass of beer in Munich.Doll, 24 In April she visited an ear specialist who removed a growth from the back of her throat, resulting in what she characterized as \\"a slight improvement\\" in her hearing.Doll, 21 She continued to study with Guérin, who recognized Lazzell's inclination for landscape art. Lazzell extended her stay in France and attended lectures at the Louvre concerning Flemish paintings, Dutch art and the Italian Renaissance. She returned to the United States at the end of September, sailing from London on the SS Arabic of the White Star Line.Doll, 22 Upon returning to Morgantown, Lazzell focused on painting and lived with her sister Bessie. She held a solo exhibition in December 1914 that included her sketches and paintings. Lazzell rented a studio where she taught art while supporting herself through the sales of hand-painted china.Doll, 23 =Provincetown= Lacking artistic stimulation in Morgantown, Lazzell journeyed to Provincetown, Massachusetts, in 1915. Already an artists' colony, Provincetown was a mecca for European artists escaping World War I. Stella Johnson and Jessie Fremont Herring, two of Lazzell's companions from her tour in Italy, were already in Provincetown and Lazzell stayed with Johnson's mother. Lazzell took a morning outdoor painting class that summer from Charles Webster Hawthorne at his Cape Cod School of Art where she was exposed to Fauvist color and technique.Shapiro, 13 She returned to Morgantown in the autumn and held an exhibition in her studio that October.Doll, 25 Lazzell returned to Provincetown the following summer and requested that painting instructor, Oliver Chaffee, teach her the white-line woodcut technique innovated by B.J.O. Nordfeldt and adopted by a group of artists who had spent the previous winter in Provincetown. The white-line woodcuts were inspired by Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints, but only used a single block of wood. Designs were etched into the surface of woodblocks, with the incised lines separating sections of the blocks. The sections were individually painted and printed onto paper with the carved portions forming white lines. Lazzell and other artists specializing in the white-line technique formed the Provincetown Printers, an artist collective that later would earn national recognition. Toward the close of 1916 she traveled to Manhattan where she studied with Homer Boss and did an analysis of color with William E. Schumacher. Two of her pieces in the white- line style were exhibited in the Provincetown Art Association's annual show in 1917. In the summer of 1917, she spent time at Byrdcliffe Colony, an artists' colony in Woodstock, New York.Doll, 26 There she studied with William Schumacher, under whom she made her first color woodcut. She also studied with William Zorach and Andrew Dasburg. In the summer of 1918 Lazzell moved to Provincetown permanently, converting an old fish house overlooking the Provincetown Harbor into a studio.Doll, 28 She spent the winters in Morgantown and Manhattan until 1922, always returning to Provincetown for the summer. In addition to her involvement with the Provincetown Printers, Lazzell was a member of the Provincetown Art Association and the Sail Loft Club, Provincetown's women's art club.Doll, 30 The Monongahela (1926) is a color woodblock print utilizing the white-line technique and depicting the Monongahela River in Morgantown Although the bohemian atmosphere of Provincetown contrasted with Lazzell's church-going conservative demeanor, she wove herself into a tight circle of friends, including Ada Gilmore, Agnes Weinrich, and Otto Karl Knaths. She became close to Simeon C. Smith, a former WVU English professor who had retired to Provincetown. She spent Thanksgiving with his family in 1918 and while the couple became romantically entangled, they never married.Doll, 29 In 1919 Lazzell was featured in an exhibition in Manhattan at the Touchstone Gallery alongside Weinrich, Mary Kirkup, and Flora Schoenfeld. Later that year, the Provincetown Printers were featured at the Detroit Institute of Arts exhibition \\"Wood Block Prints in Color by American Artists\\". That show included Lazzell's depiction of the Monongahela River in Morgantown The Monongahela, which was cut at Byrdcliffe in William E. Schumacher's studio.Shapiro, 17 Critics and galleries associated the Provincetown Printers with modernist schools of painting and the artist collective continued to receive national exposure over the next few years with exhibitions in Chicago, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and New Orleans.Doll, 31 Lazzell turned her old fish shack into a personal space and built large flower boxes around her studio, allowing morning glory and Madeira vines to grow up to the roof. Her studio's garden became a local attraction and she hosted teas for which she made homemade candy. During this time Lazzell produced white-line prints and flower monoprints and she taught painting and block printing classes.Doll, 32 =Return to Europe= Lazzell returned to Europe in 1923 with Tannahill and Kaesche, touring Italy and spending two months in Cassis before settling in Paris late that summer.Shapiro, 18 Her friend Flora Schoenfeld convinced her to dye her hair red in the fashion of many women in their circle. While in Paris Lazzell studied Cubism and geometric abstraction alongside Fernand Léger, André Lhote, and Albert Gleizes. Lazzell's work was exhibited at the Salon d'Automne and the American Women's Club in 1923.Doll, 35 She returned to Morgantown in August 1924 after her sister Bessie had given birth to a son. =Later years= Lazzell grew close to her niece, Frances Reed, for whom she was a mentor and role model. For six years she served on the committee of selection for the Annual Modern Exhibition. After her return to Provincetown in 1926, Lazzell tore down her studio and had a new building constructed, as the fish house was too cold during the winter.Doll, 36 She participated in a show called \\"Fifty Prints of the Year\\" where she debuted her compositions The Violet Jug and Trees. She was particularly influenced by Gleizes and produced a series of abstract Synthetic cubist paintings based on the golden ratio, including Painting VIII. Lazzell was a member of the international arts group Société Anonyme and was asked by artist and patron Katherine Dreier to be on its board of directors in 1928. Lazzell later joined the New York Society of Women Artists and the Society of Independent Artists.Doll, 34 Lazzell began incorporating abstract designs into her woodblocks and created designs for hooked rugs toward the end of the decade.Doll, 38 She returned to Morgantown in the winter of 1929 and offered art lessons. Among her students was Ella Sophonisba Hergesheimer.Doll, 40 In 1934, Lazzell was one of two West Virginians who received Federal Art Project grants through the Works Progress Administration.Shapiro, 19 That same year she created a mural for a court room in the Monongalia County Courthouse entitled, Justice. The mural took fourteen weeks to complete. The mural is currently displayed at the Art Museum of West Virginia University in Morgantown, WV. She continued experimenting with woodprints and, in 1935, studied with the renowned German abstract expressionist Hans Hofmann in Provincetown.Shapiro, 20 Hofmann's push/pull spatial theory is evident in the asymmetry of her later works. Lazzell's studies of flowers were inspired by her lavish potted gardens, such as Star Phlox (1931). Her 1948 floral print, Red and White Petunia, won first prize at the American Color Print Society exhibition.Shapiro, 21 A collection of her prints are housed at the Art Museum of West Virginia University. In 1956, Lazzell's health began to fail and she was hospitalized in Bourne, Massachusetts, toward the end of May for a suspected stroke. After suffering a documented stroke, Lazzell died on June 1.Doll, 56 She is interred next to her father in Bethel Cemetery in Maidsville.

The subjects of her paintings and prints included landscape scenery and harbor scenes in Provincetown as well as flowers and still lifes. These and her abstract works incorporated elements of both Synthetic and Analytic cubism and frequently comprised arrangements of vibrantly colored geometric shapes. She was among the earliest women artists in the United States to work in a modernist style. Lazzell's paintings demonstrated a rich and nuanced use of color. She preferred French watercolor pigments that, alongside the grain of the woodblocks, created embossed lines and striated patterns. Typically the woodblocks she created were made from cherry or basswood and she only pulled three or four prints from each woodblock. From 1916 to 1955, Lazzell created 138 woodblocks.Blanche Lazzell papers, reel 2988 Modern exhibitions of Lazzell's artworks have included the woodblocks themselves. Although she was a pioneer in the white-line woodcut technique and played a role in the development of abstract art in the United States, Lazzell's work faded into obscurity for a time. With a resurgence of interest in the modern print, and especially the white-line woodcut, Lazzell's popularity has surged lately. On August 3, 2012, Lazzell's print 'Sail Boat' reached a staggering $106,200 at auction.

The British frigate captured her in 1801; she was commissioned into the Royal Navy in 1803 and named HMS Charwell (or Cherwell). Charwell served in the Channel, South Atlantic, and Indian Ocean. She was laid up in 1810 and sold in 1813. French career and capture Aurore was built to a design by Charles-Henri Le Tellier. From April to July 1800 she was on a liaison mission to Île de France, via Brest and Santa Cruz de Tenerife. On 23 September she was fitted out at Brest. She then sailed again for Île de France. At the time her captain was lieutenant de vaisseau Charles Girault. Roche(2005), p.40. On 18 January Thames, under the command of Captain William Lukin, captured Aurore. She carried as a passenger the Governor’s Aide de Camp, who was carrying dispatches. She arrived at Plymouth on 6 February. She was then fitted out there between March and June 1803. The Royal Navy already had an in service (as a prison ship), so renamed the prize HMS Charwell after the River Cherwell, a tributary of the River Thames. British career Charwell was commissioned in April 1803 under Commander Phillip Dumaresq.Dumaresque had been captain of in 1801 and had sailed for several months in company with Thames, then under the command of Captain Aiskew Paffard Hollis. In early May Charwell was in the Hamoaze completely rigged and fitted for sea, but was short a crew.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 9, p.417. Once he had succeeded in forming a crew, Dumaresque sailed her in the Channel. However, by 1 September she was back in the Hamoaze. She had grounded on some rocks on the French coast. There she had had to throw her guns overboard to lighten her sufficiently that the next incoming tide could lift her. At Plymouth she was going to have some of her copper plates removed to permit inspection of her hull.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 10, p.258. On 13 September 1803 served as flagship to Admiral Sir James Saumarez. Saumarez commanded a small squadron comprising the sloops of war Charwell and , the schooner , the cutter , and the bomb vessels and . The squadron massed for a bombardment of the port of Granville where there were some gunboats moored. The squadron bombarded the port several times over the next two days. On 15 September, as Cerberus was withdrawing, she grounded. For the three hours it took to refloat her nine gunboats harried her, but without effect. When the rest of the squadron, came up they drove the gunboats away. The British retired with no information on what, if anything, the bombardment had achieved. In September 1806 Charwell was at Guernsey, under Commander Phillip Brown. However, in October Commander Edwin Chamberlyn replaced Brown. Charwell then sailed with the convoy to the River Plate where the British planned to attack Montevideo. At Montevideo, the Navy furnished guns and men for batteries. In the siege Charwell had one man killed and one missing. In April 1807 Commander the Honourable William Gordon replaced Chamberlyn. Then in 1809 Lieutenant Charles Robb sailed her for the Cape of Good Hope. On 15 July 1808 , , and Charwell shared in the capture of the French brig Lucie, and her cargo of slaves. On 28 June 1809, Charwell captured the French letter of marque Hyène.

It originally aired on Showtime in the United States on November 13, 2011. The episode was written by Meredith Stiehm and directed by Michael Cuesta. It features series regulars Claire Danes, Damian Lewis, Morena Baccarin, David Harewood, Diego Klattenhoff, Jackson Pace, Morgan Saylor, and Mandy Patinkin. Homeland centers around Carrie Mathison (Danes), a CIA agent who is convinced that Nicholas Brody (Lewis), a recently rescued American Marine, has been turned by al-Qaeda. In \\"The Weekend\\", Carrie and Brody further complicate their relationship when they head to the countryside for the weekend. Jessica (Baccarin), Brody's wife, and Mike (Klattenhoff) face the fallout of the truth about their relationship. Meanwhile, Saul (Patinkin) catches Aileen on the run to Mexico. \\"The Weekend\\" was first broadcast on November 13, 2011, and was watched by 1.42 million households in the United States. The episode was widely praised by critics. Plot Aileen (Marin Ireland) flees to Mexico but is apprehended when she gets off the bus in Nuevo Laredo. Saul (Mandy Patinkin) is there and takes Aileen into custody. He brings her on a 30-hour car ride back to Virginia, hoping to use that time to convince her to divulge her role in the terrorist plot. Brody (Damian Lewis) explains to Carrie (Claire Danes) that he needs to take a little time away from home. After stopping at a bar and having some drinks, Carrie suggests they go to a cabin out in the country that her family owns. They have sex shortly after arriving, and spend an enjoyable, romantic day at the cabin together. Both seem to be much more comfortable and at ease with each other than with anyone else. Dana (Morgan Saylor) gets drunk with her friends at home and falls through the plate glass door. With Brody gone, Mike (Diego Klattenhoff) is called upon to help. He repairs the door while Jessica (Morena Baccarin) takes Dana to the hospital to get stitches. Mike and Jessica later express how much they miss each other, and how much of an upheaval it's been to have Brody back in their lives. Dana, however, would prefer that Mike stayed away, telling him \\"there's no place for my dad when you're here.\\" As they drive cross-country, Saul relates to Aileen his own experiences with a strict Jewish upbringing, and his marital difficulties, in an attempt to get Aileen to open up. As Aileen gets more comfortable with Saul, the topic of Raqim Faisel comes up. Aileen's desire to secure a proper Muslim burial for Raqim compels her to cooperate. She tells Saul everything she knows. Saul calls Estes (David Harewood) and tells him that Aileen's job was to buy the house near the airport and wait for a visitor. The visitor spent over an hour on the roof. Estes sends Galvez (Hrach Titizian) over to the house to inspect the roof. He discovers that there is a direct line of sight to a landing pad for Marine One, the President's helicopter, and that it is within an expert sniper's range. Carrie and Brody cook dinner and have sex again. During the night, Brody has a nightmare. He wakes up yelling out \\"Issa! No!\\" Carrie hears this and tries to calm him down. The next morning, while discussing breakfast, Carrie slips up and mentions Brody's favorite brand of tea: Yorkshire Gold. Brody asks how she knows the tea he drinks and accuses her of spying on him. Carrie, knowing she has been caught, elects to turn the tables; she directly accuses Brody of being an agent of al-Qaeda. Brody reacts incredulously and challenges Carrie to ask him anything she wants. Carrie obliges and grills Brody about all his suspicious behavior since his return and the holes in his story. Brody maintains his innocence but makes some revelations. He admits his conversion to Islam and that he often prays in his garage. He says the \\"Issa\\" he mentioned in his dream was the name of a guard who treated him well. He did beat Walker to death, given the choice of killing Walker or being killed himself. He had indeed met Abu Nazir but concealed it from everyone because he had a genuine affection for the man. His suspicious finger movements are a reflexive motion coming from clutching prayer beads. As Brody is leaving, Saul calls Carrie. He reports that Aileen has identified the \\"visitor\\" who was on the roof of her house. It was Tom Walker. Not only is he alive, but he is the prisoner of war who was turned. Upon hearing this, Carrie rushes out to Brody to apologize. She desperately tries to explain that despite her suspicions, the time they spent together \\"was real\\". Brody leaves, feeling betrayed, and Carrie is reduced to tears. Brody arrives home that night, and peeks in on his wife and kids as they lie in bed. He sits down in the living room and starts crying. Production The episode was written by consulting producer Meredith Stiehm, her first of two writing credits for the first season. It was directed by executive producer Michael Cuesta, his third of the four episodes he directed for the first season.

It merged in 1959 with United Dairies to form Unigate plc, which today is known as Uniq plc. The Cow & Gate brand survives as a specialist baby food brand, owned by Netherlands-based Numico. West Surrey Central Dairy Company After the 1882 death in Guildford, Surrey of grocer Charles Gates, his two sons Charles Arthur and Leonard took over the running of the shop, which held the local distribution franchise for Gilbey's wines and spirits, and also sold beer. In line with the temperance movement, the brothers added tea and coffee to their lines. However, in 1885, the brothers were persuaded to join the temperance movement, and hence poured their entire stock into the gutters of Guildford High Street. Left with no livelihood, they converted their now empty shop into a dairy, trading under the name of the West Surrey Dairy. Using a milk separator, they bought milk from local farmers, and after extracting the cream and whey, sold the skim back to the farmers for pig feed. In 1888 three more of the Gates brothers and their sons joined the business, which led to the formal registration of the company under the name of the West Surrey Central Dairy Company Limited. From this base the company expanded quickly, buying creameries in the milk producing West Country of the country in Somerset and Dorset, and latterly Ireland. The early logo was not designed as such, but more created through what the milk jug makers had put on the outside of the companies distinctive light-brown milk jugs, which was described as: \\"A cow looking uncomfortably through a somewhat untypical four-barred gate, rather as if its neck had got stuck between the bars\\". Baby foods Advert for Cow & Gate Milk Food, \\"for infants & invalids\\", from the 16 November 1923 edition of The Radio Times (issue 8, page 276) In 1904 Dr. Killick Millard, medical officer of health for Leicester, asked the company to supply powdered milk to help feed the children of poor families. In 1908, the resultant high-protein \\"Cow & Gate Pure English Dried Milk\\" was first marketed on a large scale. In 1924 the company developed a special export version for tropical climates, and from this time registered the secondary Dried Milk Products Company Ltd to commercially wholesale various dried milk products to commercial food manufacturers. Renaming the entire company Cow & Gate in 1929, during the 1930s it worked with medical clinicians to scientifically develop specialized formulas to cater to infants with special needs, including: *Frailac: for premature infants *Allergiac: for babies sensitive to certain constituents of cow's milk *Cereal food designed to start babies on mixed feeding at an earlier age Expansion Post the First World War, the WSCDC had gone public on the London Stock Exchange under the chairmanship of Bramwell Gates, son of Walter Gates. Gates started purchasing creameries and bottling plants across the United Kingdom, starting with Wallens Dairy Company of Kilburn in 1924. In the next 15 years the dairy business footprint expanded across Cornwall, Lancashire, Yorkshire and much of Wales. To service these extensive creameries and bottling plants, which each had their own local distribution chain, the company decided to set up its own logistics company to manage the operation. Over the next 70 years, Wincanton Transport become one of the UK's largest transport concerns. In 1933 the company purchased a controlling interest in General Milk Products of Canada. Hence when the Second World War broke out in 1939, and the government banned all food exports, Cow & Gate could keep its accessible export markets throughout the war fulfilled from Canadian sourced production. Unigate After Ernest Augustus Taylor took over from the 83-year-old Bramwell Gates in 1958, his first duty was to negotiate a merger with United Dairies, the nation's largest producer of dairy products. The merger was completed in 1959, producing the new listed company, Unigate. Cow & Gate Infant Milk for Hungrier Babies Cow & Gate's Infant Milk for Hungrier Babies is marketed for a \\"bottlefed little one [who] has a bigger appetite.\\" The difference between this and their normal range is that this has higher content of casein. However, this has not passed recommendations of pediatricians as it can lead to cause digestive discomfort, constipation in some infants due to the longer digestive time, and kidney damage in babies. In fact, there is no evidence that this milk will settle a baby, or let them sleep longer, or even satisfy their hunger better.

It originally aired on Showtime on November 20, 2011. As Carrie and Saul reel from the news that Walker is alive, the intelligence community clashes on the best way to capture him; Brody learns a shocking truth about his captivity. Plot Tom Walker (Chris Chalk) is in Washington, D.C., homeless, begging for money on the street. Mansour Al- Zahrani (Ramsey Faragallah), a Saudi diplomat, passes him a key and a note written on a dollar bill. Carrie (Claire Danes) and David (David Harewood) talk to Walker's family. Helen Walker (Afton Williamson) says that her son Lucas (Jaden Harmon) reported having seen his dad, but believing him to be dead, she did not believe it to be true. In another room, Saul (Mandy Patinkin) questions Brody (Damian Lewis), who still insists that Tom Walker was killed in Iraq. When Brody returns home from Langley, he and Jessica (Morena Baccarin) have an emotional conversation concerning her relationship with Mike. She expresses regret for having moved on while he was gone, but tries to get him to understand how long she waited for him. He says he does not blame her. Saul shows Carrie his lead: Tom Walker calls his old home when his family is not home, just to hear their voices on the answering machine. Elizabeth Gaines (Linda Purl), the Vice President's chief advisor, calls the Brody household during dinner, inviting Brody to \\"the party of the year\\". The family accepts her invitation. At Saul's house, Mira Berenson (Sarita Choudhury) is packing to leave for India, and Saul is clearly upset about her plans. Carrie shows up and tells Saul that she personally contacted Brody after her surveillance operation was shut down. She insists that her personal contact with him is over. He is at first disapproving, saying it should never have happened, but then softens. A task force is set to trace Tom Walker's next call to his family's house. Helen Walker answers his call, but he hangs up. The task force is not able to trace the call. At Elizabeth Gaines' party, Gaines insinuates that Brody can be groomed to replace a politician who will soon resign because of a scandal. Tom Walker calls again, and this time Helen Walker talks to him as the FBI traces the call. But she feels as if she has betrayed him, and she warns him to run. The FBI chases him into a mosque. They rush in and accidentally kill two men who were there for morning prayer, and Tom is able to escape. After this, David suggests that they inform the public about the news, dubbing him as a \\"terrorist\\". Meanwhile, Tom Walker uses his key and note to enter a storage facility, where a sniper rifle is waiting for him. The next morning, Carrie goes to Brody's house and tells him that Tom is still alive and that he is the turned prisoner of war. Saul rushes home to see Mira. This is the morning that she is leaving for India. She is packing her things into a cab. Disappointed in the way things with Saul's career force him to be somewhat of an absentee husband, she says goodbye and the cab drives her away. Saul returns to his house, alone. Mansour Al-Zahrani comes home at night to find that someone is waiting for him. He discovers Brody, who attacks him, furious, because Abu Nazir's people had told Brody that he had killed Tom Walker—his friend. He tells Al-Zahrani that he is done talking to Abu Nazir and to \\"tell him it's over.\\" Production The episode was written by co- executive producer Chip Johannessen, his second of four writing credits for the first season.

A functioning community wasn't founded in Peru until the 1930s with the beginning of the arrival of coordinated pioneers from the United States which progressed into finding national Peruvian converts and achieved an independent national community in 1961. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying mostly on the World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 41,300 Baháʼís in 2010.  ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's Tablets of the Divine Plan  ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, the son of the founder of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States in 1916–1917; these letters were compiled together in the book titled Tablets of the Divine Plan. The sixth of the tablets was the first to mention Latin American regions and was written on 8 April 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919 – after the end of World War I and the Spanish flu. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's sixth tablet was translated and presented by Mirza Ahmad Sohrabon 4 April 1919, and published in Star of the West magazine on 12 December 1919. > \\"His Holiness Christ says: Travel ye to the East and to the West of the > world and summon the people to the Kingdom of God.

Foremost was Martha Root. Root's travels included Peru which was reported in October 1920 in an edition of the Star of the West, including making contact with several people through a Dr. Vargas.Boris Handal Morales (2011). Eve Nicklin: She of the Brave Heart (1895–1985), \\"Madre Spiritual del Perú\\".  Seven Year Plan and succeeding decades  Among the earliest Baháʼís known in Peru were Louis Mathew (1935) and Isabel Stebbins Dodge (1935–38).Shoghi Effendi, who was named ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's successor, wrote a cable on 1 May 1936 to the Baháʼí Annual Convention of the United States and Canada, and asked for the systematic implementation of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's vision to begin. In his cable he wrote: > \\"Appeal to assembled delegates ponder historic appeal voiced by ʻAbdu'l-Bahá > in Tablets of the Divine Plan.

The Baháʼí National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada appointed the Inter-America Committee to take charge of the preparations. During the 1937 Baháʼí North American Convention, Shoghi Effendi cabled advising the convention to prolong their deliberations to permit the delegates and the National Assembly to consult on a plan that would enable Baháʼís to go to Latin America as well as to include the completion of the outer structure of the Baháʼí House of Worship in Wilmette, Illinois. Following this call Stuart and Nellie S. French (1936) went through Peru. In 1937 the First Seven Year Plan (1937–44), which was an international plan designed by Shoghi Effendi, gave the American Baháʼís the goal of establishing the Baháʼí Faith in every country in Latin America. With the spread of American Baháʼís in Latin American, Baháʼí communities and Local Spiritual Assemblies began to form in 1938 across Latin America. Isabel Stebbins Dodge was joined by her mother, Mrs. Joel Stebbins, the summer of 1937.The Baha'i World; A Biennial International Record, Volume VII p.18, 129 The first pioneer under the next plan was Eve Nicklin, called the \\"Spiritual Mother of Peru\\" who arrived in Peru in 1941. In 1942–3 she was able to coordinate a number of talks by traveling Baháʼí Philip Sprague amounting to several hundred people. In 1943 during the annual Baháʼí convention of the United States, Shoghi Effendi announced a Northern- and Southern-international convention which would include representatives from each state and province from the United States and Canada and each republic of Latin America. During this convention, Isabel Tirada de Barrada and Raymond Betts were the Peruvian delegates. The first South American Baháʼí Congress was held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, November 1946. In 1947 the Baháʼí international teaching committee for South America (CEPSA) was appointed and the first members were all from Chile. Retrospectively a stated goal of the committee was to facilitate a shift in the balance of roles from North American guidance and Latin cooperation to Latin guidance and North American cooperation. The process was well underway by 1950 and was to be enforced about 1953. = Transition to Latin leadership = The second South American Baháʼí Congress was celebrated in Santiago, Chile, in January 1948 and was organized and executed by CEPSA. The Peruvian official delegate was Mercedes Sanchez. In 1950, the Baháʼí Faith achieved legal recognition in Chile with the formation of an international Regional Spiritual Assembly for South America whose first members were Edmund Miessler of Brazil, Margot Worley of Brazil, Eve Nicklin of Peru, Gayle Woolson of Colombia, Esteban Canales of Paraguay, Mercedes Sanchez of Peru, Dr. Alexander Reid of Chile, Rangvald Taetz of Uruguay, and Manuel Vera of Peru. In 1957 this Assembly was split into two – basically northern/eastern South America with the Republics of Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela, in Lima, Peru and one of the western/southern South America with the Republics of Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Bolivia in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Horace Holley represented the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States at conventions held in Panama and Lima, Peru when Latin American national Baha'i assemblies were elected.Jan. 1960: Horace Holley Left U.S. for Holy Land after Thirty-Six Years Service on U.S. National Spiritual Assembly  National community  In 1961, La Asamblea Espiritual Nacional de los Bahais del Peru was elected.America Marks Key Anniversary In Establishment Of Baha'i Faith By 1963 there were 19 delegates for the convention to elect the National Spiritual Assembly of Peru. For the election of the Universal House of Justice the international head of the religion since its election in 1963, the delegates for the voting were the members of the National Spiritual Assemblies of the world. The Peruvian members of the national assembly were recorded for this first election: Guillermo Aguilar, Fidel Flores, Cesar Loayza, Lester W. Long, Demetrio Molero, Mrs. Jesus Rivera, Josefina Rosas, Mercedes Sanchez, and Dr. Enrique Sanchez. At the same time members of the religion were known to exist among the indigenous near Arequipa, and the Quechua people. Local assemblies were formed in Arequipa, Cajamarca, Callao, Chiclayo, Huancayo, Lima, and two other villages. Groups of Baha'is were in Cuzco, Punto Tongos, and Trujillo and isolated Baha'is in Julcamarca, Talara, and Yurimaguas. = Indigenous peoples = In 1975 Baháʼís attending an All-Quechua Baháʼí Conference were photographed beside a sign, which, translated from the Spanish, reads: “Baháʼu'lláh is the return of Viracocha.” In 1975–6 Hand of the Cause Rúhíyyih Khanum travelled by boat through the tributaries of the Amazon River of Brazil and also visiting the high mountain ranges of Peru and Bolivia. Thirty six tribal groups were visited over a period of six months; the trip was called The Green Light Expedition. The first Aymara International Baha'i Conference was held in Juli, Peru, in August 1978. More than 200 Baha'is from Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru were present. The entire conference was conducted in the Aymara language. In 1980 two teams of Native American Baha'is from Alaska, Canada and the United States representing 10 tribes under the name Trail of Light traveled from the north to the south starting mid June and taught in Mexico, Belize, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Bolivia, Chile, Peru and finally Ecuador. In 1984 a reprise of the 'Trail of Light' was undertaken when an international team of five Baháʼís spent 17 days in Guatemala; they were a Mapuche Indian from Chile, a Quechua from Peru, a Bribri from Costa Rica, and two Guaymis from Panama as well as other efforts in the region. Projects promulgating the religion in southern Peru were noted in the 1980s among the Aymara people.  Recent situation  = Socio- economic development = Since its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Baháʼís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Baháʼí teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. World-wide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Baháʼí socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. Since 1977 the international Baháʼí community has established several radio stations worldwide, particularly in the Americas. Programmes may include local news, music, topics related to socio-economic and community development, educational programmes focusing on indigenous language and culture, and Baháʼí introductory and deepening material. A project studied these radio stations through faculty from Northwestern University from 1980–1982, and briefly in 1983, and reviewed Baháʼí Radio projects in Peru and Bolivia as well and resulted in a PhD by Kurt John Hein in 1985 following which he took up service at WLGI Radio Baháʼí. A Baháʼí radio station was established in Peru to nurture and preserve the local culture by featuring local story-tellers and music recorded at station-sponsored annual indigenous music festivals.Radio Baha'i Ecuador, by Kurt Hein: Review by Des O'Shea, Published in CADE: Journal of Distance Education, 4:1, 1989 With regular feedback from experienced institutions operating out of the Baháʼí World Centre progress was maintained in developments of the radio stations in communication with the Audio-Visual Department at the Baháʼí administrative offices. In 1980 almost the entire staff of the radio station in Ecuador traveled to Peru to make extensive presentations to the international Baháʼí media conference in Puno where the second Baháʼí Radio station would be set up. Staff for projects in Bolivia, Chile and Peru participated in successive training and Ecuadoran staff traveled to Peru and Bolivia to assist in those projects. In the feedback it was highlighted that: > \\"The most important and indispensable thing is to maintain a happy, loving, > spirited team-family. Try to have as high a percentage as possible of your > staff native. At least 75%. It is far better to let a native do something > wrong than not to give him the opportunity by having a foreigner do it.\\" In Peru one development for the International Youth Year was when about five hundred youth from eighteen countries in Latin America, North America and Europe attended a Youth Conference in Lima in 1985. Among the tribes and native groups represented were the Aymaras and Quechuas (Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru), the Mapuches (Chile) and the Aguarunas (Peru). Forty-seven youth organizations were officially represented on panels. Organized under the guidance of the Baháʼí National Assembly of Peru, the conference was opened by Dr. Angel Degado, acting mayor of Lima. The gathering culminated in the creation of eight national and international youth projects including the planting of some 2000 plants in Lima's Grau Square.International Youth Year  Other endeavors  • In 2000 Peru abstained from a United Nations human rights resolution about concern over the Baháʼís in Iran.United Nations Commission on Human Rights.Question of the violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms in any part of the world. E/CN.4/2000/L.16, 2000. • The Baháʼí community of Peru cooperated with the Ministerio Internacional de Desarrollo to promote religious inter-faith understanding aimed at winning wider government recognition for non-Catholic religions, leading to the establishment of a new national Directorate of Interfaith Affairs.  2008 Regional conference  Regional conferences were called for by the Universal House of Justice 20 October 2008 to celebrate recent achievements in grassroots community-building and to plan their next steps in organizing in their home areas. Just a month later a regional conference was hosted in Ecuador by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baháʼís of Ecuador in November 2008 and attracted over 1000 Baháʼís. = Demographics = The US government acknowledged Baha'is in Peru as early as 2005 and the Association of Religion Data Archives (relying mostly on the World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 41,300 Baháʼís in 2010.

His rule began in June 1246, but was temporarily cut short in 1248 after he was forced to surrender Homs and then given Tall Bashir by his cousin an-Nasir Yusuf, the Emir of Aleppo. For a short period of time during Mongol rule in 1260, al-Ashraf served as Viceroy of Syria, although the position was largely nominal. He helped achieve the Mongols' defeat at the hands of the Egypt-based Mamluks by withdrawing his troops from the Mongol coalition during the Battle of Ain Jalut as part of a secret agreement with the Mamluk sultan Qutuz. Following the Mamluk victory, al-Ashraf was reinstated as Emir of Homs as a Mamluk vassal, but was stripped of his viceroy position. Since he left no heirs, after his death, Homs was incorporated into the Mamluk Sultanate. Ayyubid emir of Homs At age 17, al-Ashraf inherited the principality of Homs after the death of his father, al-Mansur Ibrahim, in 1246. Homs was one of the smaller kingdoms within the confederate Ayyubid empire and was usually dominated by its larger neighbors, but it gained influence during the reign of al-Mansur Ibrahim. Following his death, the role of Homs within the empire largely diminished.Humphreys, p.288. From this position of weakness, al-Ashraf arrived at as-Salih Ayyub's court in Damascus during the spring of 1247 in order to gain his patronage. As-Salih, the sultan of Egypt and Damascus, was the strongest Ayyubid emir (\\"prince\\") at the time and least inclined to central rule, which mean that al-Ashraf could rule Homs with relative autonomy.Humphreys, p.291. To cement this patron- client relationship, al-Ashraf ceded control of Salamiyah, an important stronghold located north of Homs, to as-Salih.Humphreys, p.293. Fearing this alliance would undermine his position, an-Nasir Yusuf, the Ayyubid emir of Aleppo and al-Ashraf's cousin, reacted by attempting to annex Homs. As a result, al-Ashraf sent urgent pleas to as-Salih to aid him against an-Nasir. As-Salih agreed and personally led his troops from Egypt into Syria, but he fell ill and the planned assault against an-Nasir's forces were delayed. By mid-August 1248, al-Ashraf was forced to surrender Homs. Based on the terms of his surrender, he was allowed to maintain control of the desert fortress of Palmyra and al-Rahba, a fortified site situated along the northern banks of the Euphrates River. In place of Homs, he was granted the outpost of Tall Bashir to govern from, even though it was isolated from his remaining territories.Humphreys, pp.294-295. Viceroy of Syria While governing Tall Bashir, al-Ashraf secretly established ties with the Mongols who were rapidly gaining strength in the region. In 1260 the Mongols, led by Hulagu Khan, sacked Aleppo, forcing an-Nasir into exile. Al-Ashraf, who was in Damascus at the time of Aleppo's capture, traveled north to an area near the city to confer with Hulagu before he withdrew the bulk of his forces from Syria. With the arrival in Damascus of Kitbuqa, the Nestorian Christian general who oversaw affairs in Syria on behalf of the Mongols, al-Ashraf returned to the city. Upon meeting Kitbuqa, al-Ashraf was made the viceroy of Damascus and all of Syria while being reinstated as the autonomous emir of Homs.Shagrir, pp-134-135. Despite having the official title \\"sultan\\" of Syria, al-Ashraf's power was nominal. According to Israeli historian Reuven Amitai, the title was given to him so that the Mongols could have a ruler who carried some form of legitimacy and with whom they could consult. A testament to this situation was that al-Ashraf was ordered to rule from his principality in Homs instead of Damascus, which normally served as Syria's capital. Furthermore, his iqta' (allotment for military service) of 100 horses was the same as that for a battalion commander rather than a general or someone of higher rank. From Homs, he led a Mongol-ordered expedition against Hama, ruled by his cousin al- Malik Mansur, who had fled to Egypt, with the order to disable the defences of that city. Thus, al-Ashraf oversaw the destruction of Hama's citadel wall and arsenal. He also sold off the public library, but refrained from dismantling the city's walls for fear of making Hama susceptible to a Crusader invasion.Howorth, p.162. Mamluk vassal and death When the Mamluks, who had succeeded the Ayyubid sultanate in Egypt in 1250, sought to drive out the Mongols from Syria, al-Ashraf made quiet contact with Mamluk sultan Qutuz. Once the Mongol and Mamluk armies faced off during the Battle of Ain Jalut in northern Palestine in September 1260, al-Ashraf withdrew his forces from Kitbuqa's coalition and fled the battle as part of his secret arrangement with Qutuz. Al-Ashraf's action swayed the battle in the Mamluks' favor.France, p.145. Following their decisive victory against the Mongols, the Mamluks proceeded to successfully conquer Syria. Although he was stripped of his nominal position as viceroy of Damascus, al-Ashraf was allowed to continue ruling Homs as a vassal of the Mamluks as a reward for his cooperation. Baibars became Mamluk sultan in October 1260 and assigned Alam al-Din Sanjar al-Bashqirdi as deputy governor for Homs. Al-Ashraf died in the earlier part of 1263. Since he left no heirs to his throne, Homs was incorporated into the Mamluk Sultanate following his death.Holt, p.38. Family Unlike the majority of the regional Ayyubid emirs, al-Ashraf and his predecessors were descended from Asad al-Din Shirkuh, the brother of Najm ad-Din Ayyub; Ayyub was the patriarch of all the Ayyubid emirs except for those of Homs.Houtsma, p.15. In 1249, at age 20, al-Ashraf married Amat al-Latif, the spiritual adviser of Saladin's sister and the daughter of a notable Damascus-based Hanbali scholar.Necipoglu, p.41. Al-Latif was at least 40 at the time of their marriage.Necipoglu, p.53. They wed immediately after al-Latif was released from a Damascus jail where she had been imprisoned since 1246. She died in 1253.

The five arrested activists were: *Nasser bin Ghaith; an Emirati economist and lecturer at the Abu Dhabi branch of the Paris-Sorbonne University. *Ahmed Mansoor; an Emirati engineer, a blogger and a human rights activist. *Fahad Salim Dalk; an Emirati online activist. *Hassan Ali al-Khamis; an Emirati online activist . *Ahmed Abdul Khaleq; a bedoon online activist. On 27 November 2011, bin Ghaith, Dalk, al-Khamis, and Khaleq were sentenced to two years' imprisonment, and Mansoor to three years of imprisonment for being the main architect and mastermind of the website. However, the following day, the five received a presidential pardon from Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed and were released. Arrests Inspired by the growing momentum of the pro-democracy Arab Spring, Emirati activists began to be more vocal in their opposition to the UAE government in early 2011. Bin Ghaith, an \\"outspoken economics professor\\", was arrested on 11 April for his call for \\"democratic and economic reforms\\". Mansoor, an engineer, blogger, and member of Human Rights Watch, was arrested the same day for signing a petition in favor of an elected parliament, and Dalk, al-Khamis, and Khaleq were detained for their online activities before the end of the month. Following their arrests, UAE government-controlled media reported that the five were \\"religious extremists\\" and Iranian foreign agents. Their arrests received immediate international attention, with continuing coverage in the BBC News, The New York Times, and various other media. Amnesty International designated the five prisoners of conscience and called for their immediate and unconditional release, recruiting comedians and writers to lobby for their cause at the 2011 Edinburgh Festival. The organization also coined the name \\"The UAE Five\\" to refer to the men, which was later adopted by some media sources. Human Rights Watch condemned the trial as \\"an attack on free expression\\", and Front Line Defenders, the Index on Censorship, and the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information also called for the men's release. Because of his academic background, bin Ghaith's trial was also protested by the Committee for Human Rights of the US National Academy of Sciences, Scholars at Risk, and the Committee of Concerned Scientists. Trial, conviction, and pardon Their trial began on 14 June 2011 in Abu Dhabi. A Human Rights Watch spokesman criticized the \\"public relations campaign\\" of the UAE government against the defendants, stating that dozens of pro-government demonstrators were attending the trial to protest the five prisoners. The government charged the prisoners with violating article 176 of the UAE Penal Code, which criminalizes insults to the nation's leadership; the prosecutor's case focused on their posts to an online pro-democracy forum, which had by then been shut down and replaced with a travel service. On 18 July, the UAE Five pleaded not guilty. Amnesty International later condemned their trial as \\"fundamentally unfair\\" and \\"marred with irregularities\\", stating that the defendants had been \\"denied any meaningful opportunity to challenge the charges and the evidence against them\\". Human Rights Watch also described the trial as \\"grossly unfair\\". On 3 October, the UAE Five refused to attend a session of their trial, demanding that the hearings be opened to the public and that they be allowed to question witnesses. On 13 November, with the trial still in progress, the five began a hunger strike to protest their continued detention; Human Rights Watch reported that the five were in poor health. On 27 November, the panel of four judges sentenced bin Ghaith, Dalk, al-Khamis, and Khaleq to two years' imprisonment, and Mansoor to three years. Following the announcement of the verdict, a pro-government protester reportedly assaulted a relative of one of the defendants despite the heavy security presence. The following day, however, the five received a presidential pardon and were released. The office of President Khalifa declined to comment to reporters on the reason for the pardon. Bin Ghaith told reporters that he was glad to be free, but that he felt that the trial had been \\"a sad moment for our homeland, a beginning of a police state that has tarnished the image of the UAE forever\\". Nasser bin Ghaith was rearrested in March 2017 following his comments on Twitter regarding his previous arrest. His charges included “insulting the UAE”. The Amnesty International reported that he was not able to prepare a proper defence as his access to a lawyer was restricted by the UAE authorities. He has been on a hunger strike since 7 October 2018 and has become too weak to even stand, with initial loss of eyesight. Till date there has been no response from the Emirati authorities over his release. Subsequent arrests =Ahmed Mansoor Al Shehhi= Ahmed Mansoor was arrested again on March 19, 2017, at his Ajman home, on charges of publishing false information, inciting hatred, and defaming the UAE online and \\"seeking to damage the relationship of the UAE with its neighbors\\". He was also accused of conspiring with a terrorist organization but was found innocent of that charge. He was subsequently charged with 10 years in prison and 1,000,000 Emirati Dirham (approximately USD $270,000) fine. Amnesty International criticized the United Arab Emirates for Mansoor's verdict and called the charge a \\"devastating blow to freedom of expression in the country\\" and called for the unconditional release of Mansoor. Mansoor received the Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders in 2015 prior to his imprisonment. Following Mansoor’s deteriorating health conditions and massive weight loss due to his month-long hunger strike, the Human Rights Watch demanded his immediate release in April 2019 and described his sentence of 10 years in jail as an \\"unfair trial\\". In May 2019, UN human rights experts said Mansoor’s condition in the UAE prison and prolonged solitary confinement might constitute to his torture. They said they were “gravely concerned” for Mansoor’s condition in the prison and urged the UAE authorities to provide him with adequate medical support or release him. =Ahmed Abdul Khaleq= Ahmed Abdul Khaleq was again arrested by authorities for his alleged ties to al-Islah in May 2012, a political organization with roots in the Muslim Brotherhood and is listed as a terrorist organization in the UAE. Since Khaleq was not an Emirati citizen (previously a bedoon and holds a Comorian passport), he was presented with the option of being deported or conviction and imprisonment.

It tells the story of a young woman, Melanie, who is captured after the human race has been taken over by parasitic aliens called \\"Souls\\". After Melanie is infused with a soul called \\"Wanderer\\", Melanie and the alien \\"Soul\\" vie for control of her body. Written and directed by Andrew Niccol, the film stars Saoirse Ronan, Max Irons, Jake Abel, William Hurt, and Diane Kruger. Released in theaters on March 29, 2013, the film was poorly received by critics. Plot The human race has been taken over by small parasitic aliens called \\"Souls\\". They travel to planets inserting themselves into a host body of that planet's dominant species while suppressing the host's consciousness. Deeming the humans too violent to deserve the planet, they have now almost successfully taken over Earth. The consciousness of the original owner is erased, but the Souls can access the host's memories, and occupied hosts are identifiable by silver rings in the hosts' eyes. A human on the run, Melanie Stryder, is captured and infused with a Soul called \\"Wanderer.\\" Wanderer is asked by a “Seeker” Soul to access Melanie's memories and learn the location of a pocket of unassimilated humans. Melanie's consciousness, however, has not been completely eliminated; she and Wanderer carry out an internal conversation and debate with each other, eventually forming a friendship. Wanderer tells Seeker that Melanie was traveling with her brother, Jamie, and her boyfriend, Jared Howe, to find Melanie's uncle Jeb in the desert. Wanderer admits that Melanie is still present, so Seeker decides to be transferred into Melanie's body to get the information herself. With Melanie’s guidance, Wanderer escapes and makes her way to the desert, where she is found by Jeb, who takes her to a series of caves inside a mountain where the humans (including Jared and Jamie) are hiding. Wanderer's presence is met with hostility by all but Jeb and Jamie. Melanie instructs Wanderer not to tell anyone she is still alive, since it would provoke them, though she later allows her to tell Jamie. Wanderer begins interacting with the humans and slowly begins to gain their trust, forming a bond with Ian O'Shea. Seeker leads a search party into the desert. They intercept one of the shelter's supply teams, and in the ensuing chase, Aaron and Brandt commit suicide to avoid capture. During the chase, Seeker accidentally kills another Soul, leading her superiors to call off the search. Jared and Kyle move to kill Wanderer, causing Jamie to reveal that Melanie's consciousness is alive. Jeb and Ian accept this, but Jared refuses to believe it until he strategically kisses Wanderer, provoking Melanie to take back control and slap him, proving to Jared that she is still alive. Kyle tries to kill Wanderer but endangers his own life and ends up being saved by Wanderer. Ian believes that Kyle attacked Wanderer and tells her he has feelings for her. Wanderer admits that Melanie's body is compelled to love Jared, but she has feelings of her own, and the two kiss. Wanderer enters the community's medical facility and is shocked to discover that Doc has been experimenting with ways to remove Souls and allow the host's mind to regain control, resulting in the deaths of many Souls and hosts. After isolating herself for several days, Wanderer learns that Jamie is critically ill with an infection in his leg. She infiltrates a Soul medical facility to steal some alien medicine, saving Jamie's life. Seeker has continued looking for Wanderer on her own, but Jeb captures her. Wanderer offers to show Doc the proper method of removing Souls, on the condition that he later remove her from Melanie's body. Doc uses the technique to remove Seeker from her host, with both host and Soul surviving. Wanderer takes Seeker’s tiny alien form to a Soul space- travel site, where she sends it so far from Earth that it can not return for numerous generations. Tired of the many lives she’s lived and finding it too painful to leave everyone behind, Wanderer makes Doc promise to let her die when she is removed and not tell anyone. The others in the shelter intervene with Doc, who inserts Wanderer into Pet, a human who was left brain-dead after the Soul inside her was removed. Now with a body of her own, Wanderer is able to be with Ian, while Melanie reunites with Jared. A few months later, while on a supply run, Wanderer, Melanie, Ian and Jared are captured. They discover that their captors are humans, who reveal that there are several other human groups as well. They also learn that a Soul with this group has sided with the human resistance, as Wanderer has, and they may not be the last Souls to do so.

Release Distributed by Open Road Films, the film was released theatrically on March 29, 2013. The first official trailer was released on March 22, 2012, and was later shown before The Hunger Games.. Retrieved April 12, 2012. =Home media= The Host was released on DVD and Blu-ray on July 9, 2013.

It opened at #6 at the US box office, and for its opening weekend grossed $10,600,112; screened at 3,202 theaters it averaged $3,310 per theater. =Critical response= The film was widely panned by critics. On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 9% based on 128 reviews, with an average rating of 3.58/10. The site's consensus states, \\"Poorly scripted and dramatically ineffective, The Host is mostly stale and tedious, with moments of unintentional hilarity.\\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating based on reviews, the film has a score of 35 out of 100, based on 28 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". On CinemaScore polls, audiences gave the film a grade of \\"B−\\" on a scale of A+ to F. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times gave the film an unfavorable review, calling it \\"a brazen combination of unoriginal science-fiction themes, young-adult pandering and bottom-line calculation\\". Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter felt that \\"it's cloaked in yawningly familiar teen-romance terms and cries out for even a little seasoning of wit, irreverence, political smarts and genre twists that, given the well-trod terrain, seem like requisites when presenting visions of the near future.\\" Roth Cornet of IGN gave it a \\"mediocre\\" score of 5/10, stating that the film is \\"unintentionally laughable\\" and \\"frustratingly absurd\\". Cornet says that it could have made an interesting story but that the contradictions of the peaceful but parasitic Souls were not fully explained, in the case of the character Seeker only given a shallow unsatisfying explanation. She praises Ronan for her performance and blames a \\"fundamentally flawed\\" script. Ben Kenigsberg of Time Out magazine blames the source material, crediting Niccol for making the best of it, but primarily blaming the high-definition–video cinematography saying it makes \\"what once would have been a lush, grand-scale blockbuster appear cheap and televisual.\\" The Host was the penultimate film to be reviewed by film critic Roger Ebert before his death on April 4, 2013, and the last major film to be published in his lifetime. He rated the film 2.5/4 stars, saying \\"The Host is top-heavy with profound, sonorous conversations, all tending to sound like farewells. The movie is so consistently pitched at the same note, indeed, that the structure robs it of possibilities for dramatic tension.\\" = Accolades = Saoirse Ronan was nominated for a Teen Choice Award for her performance in The Host, under the category \\"Choice Movie Actress: Sci-fi/Fantasy\\", but lost to Kristen Stewart for her performance in The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2.

From April to November 2011, he was imprisoned as one of the UAE Five on charges of insulting United Arab Emirates President Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Vice President Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, and Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Amnesty International designated him a prisoner of conscience, and he was released following a presidential pardon. In May 2012, he was rearrested and given a choice between indefinite detention or exile. On 16 July, he left the country for Thailand. The UAE Five Inspired by the growing momentum of the pro-democracy Arab Spring, Emirati activists began to be more vocal in their opposition to the UAE government in early 2011. Bin Ghaith, an \\"outspoken economics professor\\", was arrested on 11 April for his call for \\"democratic and economic reforms\\". Mansoor, an engineer, blogger, and member of Human Rights Watch, was arrested the same day for signing a petition in favor of an elected parliament, and Dalk, al-Khamis, and Khaleq were detained for their online activities before the end of the month. Following their arrests, UAE government-controlled media reported that the five were \\"religious extremists\\" and Iranian foreign agents. Their arrests received immediate international attention, with continuing coverage in the BBC News, The New York Times, and various other media. Amnesty International designated the five prisoners of conscience and called for their immediate and unconditional release, recruiting comedians and writers to lobby for their cause at the 2011 Edinburgh Festival. The organization also coined the name \\"The UAE Five\\" to refer to the men, which was later adopted by some media sources. Human Rights Watch condemned the trial as \\"an attack on free expression\\", and Front Line Defenders, the Index on Censorship, and the Arabic Network For Human Rights Information also called for the men's release. Because of his academic background, bin Ghaith's trial was also protested by the Committee for Human Rights of the US National Academy of Sciences, Scholars at Risk, and the Committee of Concerned Scientists. Trial, conviction, and pardon Their trial began on 14 June in Abu Dhabi. A Human Rights Watch spokesman criticized the \\"public relations campaign\\" of the UAE government against the defendants, stating that dozens of pro-government demonstrators were attending the trial to protest the five prisoners. The government charged the prisoners with violating article 176 of the UAE Penal Code, which criminalizes insults to the nation's leadership; the prosecutor's case focused on their posts to an online pro-democracy forum, which had by then been shut down and replaced with a travel service. On 18 July, the UAE Five pleaded not guilty. Amnesty International later condemned their trial as \\"fundamentally unfair\\" and \\"marred with irregularities\\", stating that the defendants had been \\"denied any meaningful opportunity to challenge the charges and the evidence against them\\". Human Rights Watch also described the trial as \\"grossly unfair\\". On 3 October, the UAE Five refused to attend a session of their trial, demanding that the hearings be opened to the public and that they be allowed to question witnesses. On 13 November, with the trial still in progress, the five began a hunger strike to protest their continued detention; Human Rights Watch reported that the five were in poor health. On 27 November, the panel of four judges sentenced bin Ghaith, Dalk, al-Khamis, and Khaleq to two years' imprisonment, and Mansoor to three years. Following the announcement of the verdict, a pro-government protester reportedly assaulted a relative of one of the defendants despite the heavy security presence. The following day, however, the five received a presidential pardon and were released. The office of President Khalifa declined to comment to reporters on the reason for the pardon. Bin Ghaith told reporters that he was glad to be free, but that he felt that the trial had been \\"a sad moment for our homeland, a beginning of a police state that has tarnished the image of the UAE forever\\".  May 2012 arrest and deportation  As a member of the Bidoon, Khaleq had no UAE citizenship and was essentially stateless, but was granted a Comorian passport on 21 May 2012. The following day, he was arrested by authorities for his alleged ties to al-Islah, a political organization that is labeled as a terrorist organization in the UAE. According to Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, authorities told Khaleq that he must choose between permanent expulsion from the UAE to a limited number of countries or indefinite detention. Khaleq opted to leave for Thailand, departing for Bangkok on 16 July. The UAE revoked his status to reside in the country. Human Rights Watch criticized the deportation, calling the action an \\"unlawful expulsion motivated by the government's desire to stifle dissent\\". Amnesty International issued a statement that \\"Ahmed Abdul Khaleq should never have been forced to leave the country and this event sets alarm bells ringing regarding the fate of others held in the UAE in connection with alleged plots against state security\\".

April 1905 In 1894 Louis Antoine Kriéger (1868–1951) of Paris, France began designing and building electric automobiles. By 1898 when electric powered vehicle interest increased in France, Kriéger organized the Kriéger Company of Electric Vehicles (Société des Voitures Électriques Système Kriéger). The Brougham, The Landaulette and The Electrolette were three of the models produced. In 1901 43 electric vehicles were produced. In 1902 at least 65 were produced. Kriéger produced or assisted in several racing vehicles including one called 'Powerful' in 1900.The electric vehicle: technology and expectations in the automobile age,Gijs Mom, page 21 The Electrolette was a two-person vehicle. Next to either front wheel was an electric motor of 3 horse power each. The pinion comes out at the side next the wheel and engages with a large gear wheel which is fixed against it. The gear and pinion are inclosed in a tight case. Thus each wheel is turned independently by its own motor. The 800 pounds of Fulmen batteries are contained in a box which is fixed in the vehicle below the carriage body and is arranged so that it may be easily slid out from the rear. Kriéger claimed at least 65 miles on a single charge. The 1700 pound Electrolette on a level grade could do 21 miles an hour, or 12 to 15 miles over an average road. The Kriéger automobiles were the first to use regenerative electric brakes. In 1903 Kriéger produced the first hybrid electric vehicle (HEV); it had front wheel drive, power steering and a petrol engine that supplemented the battery pack. The Kriéger Company manufactured electric vehicles until 1909. There is some evidence that Louis Antoine Kriéger continuing to design and work with others afterwards, including the Electrolette name.

She wrote a best-selling trilogy about her work as a nurse and midwife practicing in the poverty-stricken East End of London in the 1950s: Call the Midwife, Shadows of the Workhouse and Farewell to The East End. A television series, Call the Midwife, based on her books, began broadcasting on BBC One on 15 January 2012. After leaving nursing, she re- trained as a musician. Biography Jennifer Louise Lee was born in Clacton- on-Sea, Essex, on 25 September 1935, to Gordon and Elsie (née Gibbs) Lee. Worth was raised in Amersham, Buckinghamshire. She had a younger sister, Christine, and two younger paternal half-sisters. After leaving school at the age of 15 she learned shorthand and typing and became the secretary to the head of Dr Challoner's Grammar School. She then trained as a nurse at the Royal Berkshire Hospital, Reading, and moved to London to receive training to become a midwife. \\"Jenny\\" Lee was hired as a staff nurse at the London Hospital in Whitechapel in the 1950s. With the Sisters of St John the Divine, an Anglican community of nuns, she worked to aid the poor. She was then a ward sister at the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital in Bloomsbury. She left midwifery to work in palliative care at the Marie Curie Hospice in Hampstead. She had a brief relationship with an architect named Alec; during their relationship, however, he died after falling from a staircase. She married the artist Philip Worth in 1963, and they had two daughters. Worth left nursing in 1973 to pursue her musical interests. In 1974, she was appointed a licentiate of the London College of Music, where she taught piano and singing. She obtained a fellowship in 1984. She performed as a soloist and with choirs throughout the UK and Europe. Many years later she began writing, and her first volume of memoirs, Call the Midwife, was published in 2002. The book became a best-seller when it was reissued in 2007. Shadows of the Workhouse (2005; reissued 2008) and Farewell to the East End (2009) also became best- sellers. The trilogy sold almost a million copies in the UK alone. In a fourth volume of memoirs, In the Midst of Life, published in 2010, Worth reflects on her later experiences caring for the terminally ill. Activism Worth was highly critical of Mike Leigh's 2004 film Vera Drake, for depicting the consequences of illegal abortions unrealistically. She argued that the method shown in the movie, far from being fairly quick and painless, was in fact almost invariably fatal for the woman. As a result of the harm done with such illegal procedures, she approved of the legalization of abortion in the UK, saying this was a medical, not moral, issue. Death Worth died on 31 May 2011, having been diagnosed with cancer of the oesophagus earlier in the year. Deeply religious, she had a commitment to God. The first episode of the television series Call the Midwife, based on her experiences in Poplar, London, in the late 1950s, was dedicated to her.

At the end of 18th century a reform movement in Poland resulted in the Constitution of May 3, 1791 which took the peasantry under protection of state (the Constitution was later overthrown by Russia). Full abolishment was enacted by the Proclamation of Połaniec but it was also short-lived as Poland was parted by her neighbours. In the 19th century various reforms on Polish territories were taking place at different paces in the Austrian partition, Prussian partition and the Russian partition. Serfdom was abolished in Prussia in 1807, in Austria in 1848, in Russia in 1861, and in Congress Kingdom of Poland, in 1864. After First Partition After the First Partition of Poland of 1772, Polish peasants who found themselves in the Austrian borders noticed some changes, particularly after the Serfdom Patent of 1781. The reformed serfdom granted peasants hereditary ownership of land, they could not be removed from the land without a court order, the serfdom was limited to three days a week, the serf children could seek education outside agriculture, and the government control and administration was extended to the serfs. But still peasants could not buy the lands on their own. Frederick the Great having gained a significant amount of land in the first partition of Poland, proceeded to introduce reforms in them which also included abolition of serfdom. The Polish peasants who found themselves in the Prussian borders noticed some small improvements, as the peasants couldn't be removed from land without a court order; they had the right to buy themselves out of serfdom, and send children to education aimed at attaining positions outside agriculture. German colonists were however given preferential treatment compared to Polish peasants. Either way, the Prussian reforms were not going as far as the Austrian ones. On the other hand, they were later discriminated because of their nationality (e.g. Drzymała's wagon and the German Kulturkampf measures). The Polish peasants who found themselves in the Russian borders were subject to an even harsher serfdom demands than they had in Poland. They also had to serve in the Imperial Russian Army. In the 19th century Serfdom was abolished in the Duchy of Warsaw on July 22, 1807, and in Prussia later that year on November 11, 1807. The reforms of the Congress Kingdom of Poland did not change the peasant situation significantly. The years 1830-1850 saw a raising conflict between the serfs, anti-serfdom activists and pro-serfdom governments, with increasing unrest and peasant rebellions particularly in Prussia and Austria. In Prussia, numerous smaller reforms improved the situations of peasants over the 19th century. In Austria, the reforms were spurred by the Kraków Uprising of 1846 and the Spring of Nations in 1848, resulting in the abolishment of serfdom in 1848. In 1846, in Congress Poland peasants gained protection from being removed from their land, and several other beneficial changes were also implemented. At the same time, unrest in the villages continued, affecting about 20% of those still under serfdom. Following the Emancipation reform of 1861 of Western Krai and the January Uprising of 1863-1864, an emancipation reform was introduced that went beyond that of the Russian Empire. In particular, peasants were allowed to regain some territories that they were removed from in the past. In Austria and Russia, many reforms improving the peasant situation on the Polish territories were spurred by, and accelerated by the governments desire to ensure peasant support for them, instead of the Polish activists, and to deny the Polish activists the additional support from the simmering peasant unrest.

He raced until he was six years old, winning seven races and retiring to stud in 1785. He was not a successful sire. Background Young Eclipse was foaled in 1778 and was bred by Dennis O'Kelly, who owned his sire Eclipse and stood him at his Clay Hill Stud farm near Epsom for a 50-guinea per mare stud fee. O'Kelly was an Irish immigrant who had made his fortune through professional gambling, Eclipse's stud fees and the profits of a brothel run by his lover Charlotte Hayes. Eclipse was undefeated during his racing career, winning 18 races, and is the foundation sire from which most modern Thoroughbreds descend. Young Eclipse's dam, Juno (foaled in 1764), was bred by the Duke of Ancaster and produced nine foals between 1772 and her death in 1793. Young Eclipse was her sixth and most notable foal. Young Eclipse was considered \\"fleeter\\" than his sire at distances less than three miles and reportedly was ill-tempered and \\"what the jockeys call rusty.\\" Racing career Cameo of Dennis O'Kelly, Young Eclipse's breeder and owner Young Eclipse was trained \\"privately\\" at Epsom and the name of his trainer was not recorded.

He retired to stud in 1785 after he injured a fetlock during his last race. =1781: three-year- old season= The second Derby Stakes was run on 24 May 1781 with a field of thirteen horses. The betting favorite was John Lade's colt Crop at odds of 5 to 4 with odds on Young Eclipse at 10 to 1. Young Eclipse won the race, with Crop finishing second and Prince of Orange third. On 31 May at Epsom, he lost two £50 two-mile heats to the colt Laburnum. At the October Meeting at Newmarket, Young Eclipse received an unspecified forfeiture from a filly sired by Sweetwilliam. =1782: four-year-old season= Young Eclipse won a match race against the horse Blush at Newmarket. Young Eclipse did not place in the Claret Stakes, the race being won by the colt Crop and the second-place finisher Regent receiving \\"two hogsheads of claret\\" from Crop's owner. On 20 June, Young Eclipse was fourth in a sweepstakes race which was won by the colt Arske. He received 50-guineas forfeiture from the colt Fox at Epsom and a 100-guinea forfeiture from Orando at Newmarket in October. Young Eclipse was third in a 60-guinea Purse race, losing to the filly Dido and the colt Flamer. =1783: five-year-old season= At the First Spring Meeting in Newmarket, Young Eclipse beat the horses Alric and Crop for a 100-guinea sweepstakes race. In July, he again beat Crop in a 500-guinea race and received a 60-guinea forfeiture from the colt Skinflint. At Burford, Young Eclipse won the King's Plate on 19 August. At Lichfield, Young Eclipse lost the Ladies' Purse to the colt Petrarch who won three heats in the race after Young Eclipse won the first heat. =1784: six-year-old season= Young Eclipse was third in a £50 race at the First Spring Meeting in Newmarket to the colts Mercury and Signor. In Newmarket during the Second Spring Meeting, Young Eclipse won a match race against the colt Imperator and won a £50 race by winning two-mile heats against Lord Grosvenor horse Flamer. He received 150 guineas forfeit from the colt Assassin (the 1782 Derby winner) in July and walked over for the 100-guinea King's Purse on 3 August at Nottingham. Young Eclipse's last turf appearance occurred in York for the August Meeting where he \\"broke down\\" while running for the King's Purse against the horses Recovery and Monk. He had dislocated one of his fetlock joints and was permanently retired from racing. Stud career Young Eclipse was retired to stud after his racing career. By 1796, he was listed as a stallion at Colney Chapel, 3 miles from St. Albans, for a fee of 20 guineas per mare and a one guinea groom fee. He was advertised in the stallion register in 1803, but was not mentioned in the 1804 edition. Young Eclipse is not considered to be a successful sire. Young Eclipse sired a colt, also named Young Eclipse, that was foaled in 1799 out of a Highflyer mare and was owned by a Mr. Wilson. This Young Eclipse was second in the 1802 Epsom Derby to the colt Tyrant and was considered \\"the best horse of his year.\\" He is often confused with his sire.

The Philippines has a complex student union with different names such as student government, the term used in all public secondary schools and some of the universities and/or colleges and student council for most of the colleges/universities. History The Center for Students and Co-Curricular Affairs (CSCA) was established in 1996 in order to further facilitate co-curricular work of student councils in the country and mold them to be better leaders. In 2003, the Supreme Student Governments were institutionalized starting with the establishment of the National Federation of Supreme Student Governments (NFSSG) with David Maulas of Bohol as its first National Federation President elected during the 1st National Leadership Training for Student Government Officers (NLTSGO). An institutionalized Constitution and By Laws of the Supreme Student Governments were enforced through a Department Order No. 43, s. 2005, then revised in 2009 as per Department Order No. 79, s. 2009.

At 22:05 GMT (16:05 EDT) on 3 February 1959 it was involved in one of the most notable jet upset incidents of the jet airliner age, over the North Atlantic near Newfoundland. Aircraft The aircraft was a Boeing 707-121 with registration N712PA, nicknamed \\"Clipper Washington\\". Its first flight was on October 13th, 1958 (the same month that 707s entered regular service with Pan Am), and when the incident occurred less than four months later, the aircraft had accumulated only 705 total flight hours. Incident The jet, crewed by pilot-in-command Captain Waldo Lynch, Captain Samuel Peters, flight engineer George Sinski, and navigator John Laird, with 119 people on board, experienced an emergency descent of 29,000 feet from 35,000 feet with the autopilot engaged when the captain left the cockpit and entered the main cabin. During his absence, the autopilot disengaged and the aircraft smoothly and slowly entered a steep descending spiral. The copilot was not properly monitoring the aircraft's instruments or the progress of the flight and was unaware of the actions of the aircraft until considerable speed had been gained and altitude lost. During the rapid descent the copilot was unable to effect recovery. When the captain became aware of the unusual attitude of the aircraft he returned to the cockpit and with the aid of the other crew members was finally able to regain control of the aircraft at approximately 6,000 feet; they later made an emergency landing at Gander with damaged flaps. Investigation Evidence was subsequently given to the then United States Civil Aeronautics Board that the aircraft was flying at 35,000 ft at Mach 0.82 and at a weight of about 195,000 lb. During the previous two flights the Bendix PB-20 autopilot was reported in one case to have caused a nose-down pitch and in another to have disconnected following a change of heading of 20 deg, but on February 3 operation was found to be normal on arrival at Gander. The disengagement warning light was fully dimmed. Reports Flight Magazine's issue of 3 April 1959 reported \\"Captain Waldo Lynch, the pilot-in- command, said that the aircraft went into a sharp manoeuvre downward and to the right. At 17,000 ft the airspeed was over 400 kt, the electric trim button was inoperative, and his gyro horizon had tumbled. The copilot recounted that \\"At 2200Z the navigator posted a change in heading requiring left turn. Used autopilot turn knob. Turn O.K. . . . Then light buffeting, plus positive load factor building up. . . . Heavy buffeting caused panel lights to fail.\\" The flight engineer said that he was pinned to his seat as the Mach warning sounded. When the g load was relieved, he pulled the tailplane-power and autopilot circuit-breakers because he thought that the tailplane had \\"run away.\\" Full nosedown tailplane inclination of 3 degrees was indicated. He wound it back to the nose-up position but later trimmed nose-down. Aviation Safety Network reports the cause of the incident as unintentional disconnection of autopilot while captain had left the cockpit and entered the passenger cabin. The copilot did not pay sufficient attention to the instruments and the plane went into a dive in a clockwise spiraling turn. Later history of the aircraft After being operated by a number of firms, the airframe was finally scrapped in August 1984, at Taipei, Taiwan.

He is best known for his 1968 recording of the serial killer song \\"Psycho\\" written by Leon Payne, produced by John Capps and issued on the K-ark Records label. Early life and career Noack was born in Houston, Texas and attended Baylor University, where he earned a bachelor of arts degree in English and journalism. Noack decided on a career in music after winning a talent contest in 1947. A honky tonk singer influenced by Hank Williams, he appeared frequently on radio and was signed by Gold Star Records in 1949. That same year, Gold Star released his song Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, which was not a cover of the eponymous song from the 1949 musical but a parody of it. He also recorded the single “Have Blues Will Travel/The Price of Love” for Gold Star in 1959 but recorded for many labels during the decade of the 1950s. He began recording for Four Star in 1951 as part of R.D. Hendon and His Western Jamboree Cowboys, a band specializing in the honky tonk, country swing, and country boogie styles, and later rockabilly. (The band later recorded Noack's song We Smiled as a B-side in 1956 for Starday.) Too Hot To Handle, his own composition, was leased by Four Star to the TNT label, establishing his reputation as a songwriter. In 1953, he was signed by Starday, which was owned by record producer Pappy Daily, with whom he would work for the bulk of his professional career. Noack was drafted in 1954 and spent two years in the Army. The second Noack came home, he adopted a female sausage dog, named Biscuit. Back in the music business, he flourished as a songwriter at Starday, with Hank Snow's cover of his song These Hands reaching No. 5 on the C+W charts in 1956. When Pappy Daily founded D Records in 1958, he signed Noack, and his recording of his own composition Have Blues Will Travel reached No. 14 on the country charts. Under the name \\"Tommy Wood\\", Noack recorded rockabilly music. Later career and death Eddie Noack quit performing after 1959 to concentrate on songwriting and to become involved in music publishing. Noack was employed by Pappy Daily and Lefty Frizzell in publishing while he continued to write songs. His compositions were covered by many country singers, including Johnny Cash (These Hands), George Jones and Ernest Tubb. He made several comebacks as a performer but never reached a wide audience. In 1968, Noack recorded his cover of \\"Psycho\\" for K-Ark Records, which sold little and received negligible air play. He also continued recording into the 1970s, including an album of Jimmie Rodgers covers. Among the labels he recorded for were All Star Records, Mercury Records, Tellet Country Records, and Wide World Records. In 1976, Noack moved to Nashville, where he was employed as an executive with the Nashville Songwriters Association. He recorded his final album that year, which was released by Look Records in the United Kingdom. He backed up the album with a British tour. He was still an executive with the Nashville Songwriters Association when the hard-drinking Noack died of a cerebral hemorrhage at age 47 on February 5, 1978 in his home in Nashville.

It is found in circumpolar marine environments in the Northern Hemisphere.

Description Gorgonocephalus eucnemis has a central disc up to across with five pairs of arms that branch dichotomously into smaller and smaller subdivisions. Its colour is varying shades of white and beige, often with a darker disc. It has an endoskeleton of calcified ossicles and is covered in a fleshy layer of skin giving it a rubbery appearance. The arms are covered in tiny hooks and spines which can be used to grip and manipulate food particles.Gorgonocephalus eucnemis The Race Rocks Taxonomy. Retrieved 2012-01-22.

It also occurs in the Pacific Ocean from the Bering Sea south to Japan and Laguna Beach, California. It is mostly found in rocky areas with strong currents at depths to , but is most common at depths of . It is also found on mud and sandy seabeds among boulders, sea pens, and sea fans.Gorgonocephalus eucnemis Muller and Troschel, 1842 Walla Walla University. Retrieved 2012-01-22. Biology It feeds by perching in an elevated position and extending its arms in a net-like fashion perpendicular to the current. The branches and branchlets twist and coil, making it resemble an animated bush. It ensnares small crustaceans such as the northern krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica), copepods, chaetognaths, jellyfish, and detritus that come within reach. Trapped prey becomes the centre of a \\"knot\\" where it is immobilised by the secretion of mucus. Further coiling of the branches brings the food to the mouth which is on the underside of the central disc. Here, the branchlets are passed through a comb-like structure which removes the food particles. There is no anus and any undigested fragments are expelled through the mouth. Individual basket stars are either male or female. After spawning, the larvae become part of the plankton and disperse with the currents. left Ecology G. eucnemis is cryptic and remains well hidden during the day. It is protected by the toxic nature of the sponges where it lurks, but is sometimes eaten by fish and crabs. It has been observed to return to a specific location regularly. It is often found living in association with sponges and soft corals in the genus Gersemia, hiding under them or in the folds of the sponges during the day and using them as elevated platforms for searching for prey at night. In Puget Sound, juveniles have been found to be living and apparently feeding inside the pharynges of Gersemia rubiformis polyps, only emerging when sufficiently grown to fend for themselves.

The names are backronyms for the Telex IFB-XXX model line.http://www.telex.com/us/wireless/product/IFB-325/1437 Less common names for the system include program cue interrupt (PCI) and switched talkback. IFB is often facilitated using an earpiece that on-air persons wear to get cues, feedback or direction from their control rooms. The earpiece itself may also be referred to as an IFB. Sometimes IFB is accomplished by the director talking to off-camera personnel who visually cue the on-camera talent. The IFB is a special intercom circuit that consists of a mix-minus program feed sent to an earpiece worn by talent via a wire, telephone, or radio receiver (audio that is being \\"fed back\\" to talent) that can be interrupted and replaced by a television producer's or director's intercom microphone. On a television news program for example, a producer can talk to the news anchors, to tell them when they are live on the air and when to begin reading off the script on the teleprompter or cue cards. In live television, some news anchors are seen listening to IFBs in order to report breaking news and announcements. In electronic news gathering (ENG), the IFB can be sent through a telephone hybrid, or some other return link in a broadcast auxiliary service. The physics and design of electronics cause time delays in signals as they travel through wire, fiber optics, or space and when they are converted back and forth from physical sound, electronic signals, radio waves, and from analogue to digital. The latter process and other audio processing can introduce unacceptable delays or echos into the sound. To achieve the mix- minus program to the IFB, certain audio elements that originate remotely from the mix point will be eliminated from the mix that is sent back to the IFB at the remote site to avoid those undesirable effects. Wired or wireless in-ear monitors (IEMs) may be used to carry the IFB audio to the on-air talent.

Plot Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy are on a whaling boat in search of whales. Donald tries to eat a sandwich for lunch, but seagulls bother and harass him to get the sandwich and end up eating most of it. While Donald is preoccupied with fighting off the gulls, a pelican eats the remainder of the sandwich. Meanwhile, Mickey tries to pitch a bucket of water off the ship, but it keeps coming back to him, to his annoyance. Donald and Goofy spot a sleeping whale, but Goofy's efforts to shoot a harpoon keep failing because he doesn't have all the tools needed (at one point, he sets his own bottom on fire). He eventually succeeds in launching the anchor in place of the harpoon, but his foot gets caught in the attached line and when the anchor hits an iceberg he ends up hanging from the line above the whale's head. Donald rushes to Goofy's rescue, but isn't fast enough and Goofy falls off the line, through the whale's blowhole, and ends up in the whale's mouth. Lighting a match so he can see better, Goofy inadvertently wakes the whale up and it starts coughing. A wave comes in through the whale's open mouth and washes Goofy around. He gets blown out of the whale's blowhole and falls back down, his head getting stuck in the blowhole. Meanwhile, Donald falls into the water and is chased by the angry whale back to the ship, where, after Donald is nearly eaten, the whale rams and destroys the ship. Mickey, Donald and Goofy fly through the air and land on a small raft made of the ship's debris.

A number of his surviving buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Ryder was born in Orrington, Maine, but by 1831 was residing in nearby Bangor, Maine with his brother Perry, a plane-maker. Within two years he had relocated a few miles down the Penobscot River to Winterport, Maine (then part of Frankfort), where he received his first known commission, the Winterport Congregational Church (1833). Ryder was likely the builder as well as the architect for this and other early commissions.Roger G. Reed, “Calvin Ryder” in Earle G. Shettleworth and Roger G. Reed, eds., A Biographical Dictionary of Architects in Maine (Augusta, Me.: Maine Historic Preservation Commission, 1984-88) [serially published and distributed] In the early 1840s Ryder designed and built at least four Greek Revival houses in the port of Belfast, Maine, just south of Winterport: the Sherburne Sleeper House (1840), Hiram Alden House (1840), James P. White House (1842), and Joseph Williamson House (1844–45). The White House, the only one to remain entirely unaltered, has since become a famous coastal Maine icon, particularly for its glass cupola. Ryder was threatened with debtor’s prison in 1846 and relocated to Boston.Roger G. Reed, “Calvin Ryder” in Earle G. Shettleworth and Roger G. Reed, eds., A Biographical Dictionary of Architects in Maine (Augusta, Me.: Maine Historic Preservation Commission, 1984-88) [serially published and distributed] In Boston, Ryder went into partnership with William Hovey, later with Enoch Fuller, and still later with Edward D. Harris. His major idiom in the 1850s-60s became the Mansard style, and he pioneered its use in a number of wooden mansions around Boston and Cambridge. A design for he sent back to Bangor, Maine for the William Blake House (1858), built by his sister and brother-in-law, established a look which came to define that city’s domestic architecture in the 1860s.

Biography Carmela Remigio was born in Pescara and began to study violin when she was five years old. She later began vocal training with Aldo Protti at the Accademia Musicale Pescarese. After graduating she continued her vocal training with Leone Magiera. In 1992 she won first prize at the Luciano Pavarotti International Voice Competition in Philadelphia. From 1997 she performed with Luciano Pavarotti in more than 70 concerts around the world. Remigio made her professional debut at the Teatro Massimo of Palermo in 1993 in the title role of Giampaolo Testoni's new opera Alice.

Initially he joined the King movement in opposing the selling of Māori land to the government, but when a chief of Te Āti Awa, Wiremu Kīngi got into conflict with the government over the sale of land at Waitara, he broke with the movement and sided with the government over issues of land and sovereignty.Encyclopedia of NZ.T Te Rauparaha.

It was composed between March-August 1971. The work was commissioned by the BBC to be performed as part of Pierre Boulez's series of concerts at the Roundhouse in 1972. Boulez refused to conduct the piece. Instrumentation #Flute #Oboe #Clarinet in B flat #Bass Clarinet #Horn in F #Trumpet in B flat #Trombone #Violins (2) #Viola #Cello #Double Bass #100 kazoos (played by the audience). Performance directions The audience kazoo part is for 50 men and 50 women. The score recommends a 10-15 minute rehearsal with the audience prior to performance. The piece makes considerable use of improvisation and aleatoric techniques, most notably when performers are asked to interpret on their instruments a number of Bedford's rudimentary line drawings. At certain points, the chamber ensemble and the kazoo section are also required to imitate one another. The composition is indicative of Bedford's sense of humour and, like many of his works, draws upon elements of astronomy and science fiction. Amongst the images which performers are required to interpret, for example, are a star chart, the planet Saturn and a spaceman playing cards with aliens. Dedicatees of the work include the science fiction writers Roger Zelazny, Theodore Sturgeon, Samuel R. Delany and the astronomer Patrick Moore. According to Bedford, his composition for kazoos was the result of a misunderstanding with Boulez regarding the concept of audience participation. For Boulez, 'audience participation' meant a question-and- answer session about music between himself and the audience. Boulez refused to conduct Bedford's work on the grounds that audience members would interrupt other pieces on the programme with their kazoos.

The narrative follows an American housewife and a North African woman who travel from Chicago to Santa Fe to participate in a bellydance competition. The film is a co-production between companies in France, the United Kingdom and the United States. Bouchareb intends it to be the first in a trilogy about the relation between North America and the Arab world. Plot The film depicts a few days in the lives of two women, Marilyn (Sienna Rose Miller) and Mona (Golshifteh Farahani) who, on the outside, could not be more different. Marilyn is an American-born menial secretary at a small business. Mona is an Egyptian immigrant who manages the convenience store next door with her mother-in-law (Chafia Boudraa) and her husband, Mourad (Roschdy Zem). During brief encounters, the women find solace in each other from the stress of their daily lives. Marilyn's husband, Harvey (Jesse Bob Harper), is unemployed. Feeling jealous and emasculated, he criticizes her taking part in a belly-dancing class (believing that she is too old) and uses her money to spend his nights drinking at bars. Meanwhile, Mona endures the constant plague of verbal abuse from her mother-in-law who blames her for not conceiving a child. Though in love with his wife, Mourad refuses to stand up to his mother, a disappointment that leaves Mona feeling depressed and alone in their marriage. One day, Marilyn comes to work and is fired due to the recession. Distraught and angry, she goes home and is disgusted to see Harvey having sex with another woman in their bed. Acting on advice from her dance coach, Marilyn decides to attend an audition for a dance company in Santa Fe and leaves Chicago without telling Harvey. On the same day, Mourad's mother reveals that she has found him a new wife who will bear a child within a year. Distracted by the news, Mona spills her mother-in-law's pillbox and, in her haste to collect the pills, gives her the wrong dosage. The next morning, Mourad finds his mother dead. Horrified by the discovery that she is responsible, Mona flees, intent on leaving the country. Later on, the police question Mourad about her whereabouts. At the same time, Marilyn ignores Harvey's calls and is intent on driving 1,300 miles to Sante Fe. At a rest stop, she sees Mona and assumes that she too has fled her unhappy life at home. She invites her to come along and Mona agrees to be her dance partner for the gigs they will be performing along the way. While on the journey, the women bond as they realize that although they come from vastly different cultures, they share a like-mind and a desire to be free from the upsets of the past. Mona assures Marilyn that she is not too old to be dancing (citing the example of famed Egyptian dancer Samia Gamal) and Marilyn defends Mona from the advances of a night-club owner at their first gig. While backstage, Marilyn finds a newspaper with a photo of Mona in a missing person's ad. Mona insists that her mother-in-law's death was accidental, but Marilyn is furious and accuses her of making her an accomplice in a getaway. Though conflicted, Marilyn leaves Mona on a Native American reservation with the money she has earned and drives off to Santa Fe alone. Minutes later, however, she gets a call from Harvey (who has since reported her missing) and breaks down with the realization that in ten years of marriage, they have done nothing as a couple. Knowing now that she has received more support from Mona than from anyone else in years, Marilyn goes back to the reservation and apologizes. The friends make up over their reflections on motherhood and their resolve to have Marilyn succeed at the audition in the next two days. While at a campsite, the women's presence and the foreignness of their dancing provokes a racist woman who hurls insults at Mona. Marilyn defends her heatedly and the woman retaliates by having her husband and son assault her, breaking her arm and dashing her hopes of performing. Quelled by this latest disaster, Mona calls Mourad, who has been sitting on the front lawn for days awaiting her return. He promises her a new start in a different city where they can adopt children, but Mona sees the fallacy of a life in which her mother-in-law's death will always cast a shadow on their marriage. She tells Mourad that she is coming back to Chicago to turn herself in, but not before giving one last thank you to Marilyn. At the auditions, Mona performs under Marilyn's name and is approved by the judges. Knowing that there is no way they will believe she was Mona, however, Marilyn catches up to her at the train station and tears up the certificate of acceptance. She chooses, instead, to go back to Chicago and support Mona when she confronts the police. Content to put the past behind them, they hold hands and dance on the platform, ready to face the future together however uncertain it may be.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 for its architectural significance. With St. Luke's parish was established in 1842, the ninth Episcopal parish in Wisconsin. Its first church building burned in 1866. That same year E. Townsend Mix of Milwaukee began designing the replacement, which remains the current church building. Lucas Bradley built it. Its style is Gothic Revival, with walls of cream brick, buttresses, a rose window above the main entrance, lancet windows, and a 150-foot corner tower turned 45 degrees from the rest of the building. The steeple is octagonal, with four clocks from the Seth Thomas Co. The church is close to the same design that Mix used for First Methodist in Monroe. Behind the church on 7th Street is the Chapel of the Holy Spirit. It was originally built in 1849 as an early fire station — Engine House No. 3. In 1899 it was donated to the church and converted to a chapel. In 1930 it was restyled Gothic Revival to complement the church. In 1898 the parish built a guildhall west of the firehouse. It is styled Gothic Revival like the other buildings, with lancet windows and a cross in the brickwork. Between 1905 and 1910 the rectory was added, a 2.5 story cream brick building designed by A. Arthur Guilbert in Gothic Revival style. It has since been converted to serve as Parish Center, with an auditorium added in 1956.

Biography Albert Chartier was the son of Joseph Chartier, a traveling salesman who lived in the United States, an employee of the company Lowney's. He inherited his father's innate sense for business practice and perfect command of English which enabled him to become a comic artist of international caliber. Boasting a bilingual family, Albert Chartier decided to perfect his English by entering the Montreal High School because, in the late 1920s, English was an essential tool for any young person who dreamed of escaping poverty that touched so many Canadian homes. After high school, he made an attempt at the offices of an insurance company to find out after one day that paperwork was not for him. Charles Maillard, Director of the School of Fine Arts in Montreal, was a regular at the Chartier home and encouraged the young Albert to pursue the arts. Early in his classes, Chartier appreciated the rigor and perfectionism of his teachers as they responded very well to his expectations. But he soon discovered that the more traditional medium of fine art did not suit him. In this conservative and elitist environment, illustration and comics were rather seen as popular art forms, not of artistic value. At fifteen years of the Refus Global, which would seriously shake the art scene and question many concepts, the middle of Fine Arts was largely conservative and Chartier accommodated its evil. His penchant for illustration were already being felt, he lamented that they did not even mention in his courses some of the modern artistic techniques as applied to figurative art that particularly interested him. On 25 October 1935, Chartier landed his first professional contract with his first comic, the Sunday BouBoule, published in La Patrie until 21 March 1937, scripted by journalist René Boivin. In 1940, Chartier left Québec for New York for almost two years, producing humorous cartoons on a freelance basis, including for Big Shot Comics magazine published by Columbia Comics. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States entered the World War and, as his renewed work permit meant he could be forced to join the U.S. Army, Chartier decided to return home, where offers were not long to wait for. The first contract was from the Wartime Information Board in Ottawa in which he made comics and panel gags in government publications distributed to entertain the soldiers. Chartier's Onésime was the longest-lived Québec comic strip In 1943, one of his cousins offered Chartier the chance to appear in the Bulletin des agriculteurs (\\"Farmers' Bulletin\\") as an illustrator. He then engaged in illustrating the stories of Gabrielle Roy, as well as novels and short stories. In November that year, he was offered the opportunity to create a comic strip. Chartier's comic strip Onésime lasted 59 years, from November 1943 until June 2002. He also created Séraphin for the same paper. In 1991, Onésime was to be dropped following the sale of the magazine to Maclean Hunter, but an outcry arose among the sales representatives and especially among the public of the Bulletin, and the idea was quickly abandoned. Inspired by the rural audience targeted by the magazine, his own family and social experiences of the picturesque Saint-Jean-de-Matha, with Onésime Chartier created a chronicle of country life and, implicitly, a history of the evolution of the mentality and society of Québec. From 1963 to 1964, Chartier's Les Canadiens was distributed by the Toronto Telegram News Service across Ontario and Québec. This was a bilingual, historical strip. He also contributed a weekly gag cartoon to the Radio-monde for about twenty years, and did about 100 full-colour painted covers for Le Samedi and La Revue in the 1940s and 1950s. Chartier died 25 February 2004. Bibliography * Les aventures d'un Québécois typique - Onésime, tome 1. Éditions de L'aurore, 1974 * Les aventures d'un Québécois typique - Onésime, tome 2.

Help seeking theory falls into two categories where some consider similarity in the process' (e.g. Cepeda-Benito & Short, 1998) while others consider it as dependent upon the problem (e.g. Di Fabio & Bernaud, 2008). In general help seeking behaviors are dependent upon three categories, attitudes (beliefs and willingness) towards help-seeking, intention to seek help, and actual help-seeking behavior.Gulliver, Griffiths, Christensen & Brewer, 2012 Types Help seeking behavior is divided into two types, adaptive behavior and non-adaptive behavior. It is adaptive when exercised to overcome a difficulty and it depends upon the person's recognition, insight and dimension of the problem and resources for solving the same, this is valued as an active strategy. It is non-adaptive when the behavior persists even after understanding and experiencing the problem solving mechanism and when used for avoidance. Dynamic barriers in seeking help can also affect active process (e.g.: culture, ego, classism, etc. ). Nelson-Le Gall (1981) distinguished between instrumental help-seeking, which she regarded as being essential for learning, and passive dependency.Nelson-LeGall, S. (1981). \\"Help-seeking: An understudied problem-solving skill in children\\". Developmental Review, 1, 224-246. Public health Help seeking behavior in public health is divided into following steps:T. Laine Scales, Calvin L. Streeter, H. Stephen Cooper; Rural Social Work: Building and Sustaining Community Capacity, 2013; John Wiley & Sons * Self-care: Self-evaluation and self-administration for the physical or psychological problem. * Social networks: Seeking information to eradicate the problem through community resources. * Helpers: Seeking help from informal (priest, holistic healers, pharmacists, etc.) and formal helpers (physicians, psychologists, social workers, etc.) related to the field. * Gatekeepers: They are incoming form of help from the community by understanding the presence of problem and they are resourceful members of a community who can link/direct the person in need with potential sources of help. Psychological investigations Help-seeking has received a lot of research attention in academic contexts.Karabenick, S. A. (Ed.) (1998). Strategic help-seeking: Implications for learning and teaching. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum. Karabenick & Newman, 2006Karabenick, S. A., & Newman, R. S. (Eds.) (2006). Help-seeking in academic settings: Goals, groups, and contexts. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum. Help-seeking behaviors are often linked to goal- orientation theory, with mastery-oriented students being more likely to manifest adaptive strategies and performance-oriented students being more likely to manifest non-adaptive strategies (Ames, 1983; Butler, 1999, 2006; Hashim, 2004; Ryan, Gheen, & Midgley, 1998). Several researchers have found that women have significantly more positive attitudes than men towards seeking help from professional psychologists.Leong, F. T. L., & Zachar, P. (1999). \\"Gender and opinions about mental illness as predictors of attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help\\". British Journal of Guidance and Counseling, 27(1), 123-132. Shea & Yeh, 2008Shea, M., & Yeh, C. J. (2008). \\"Asian American Students' cultural values, stigma, and relational self- construal: correlates of attitudes toward professional help seeking\\". Journal of Mental Health Counseling, 30, 157-172. When facing need, students with high self-efficacy tend to manifest high help-seeking behavior, whereas students with low self-efficacy are, under similar circumstances, more reluctant to seek help (Linnenbrink & Pintrich, 2003; Nelson & Ketelhut, 2008; Paulsen & Feldman, 2005; Pintrich & Zusho, 2007; Tan et al., 2008). In 2011 it was reexamined and peer reviewed that affiliation cues can prime people to seek help in closed group contexts.Rubin, M. (2011). \\"Social affiliation cues prime help-seeking intentions\\".

This featured the same sound quality and shape as the original SoundLink Mini with a few subtle changes. Firstly the controls on the top of the speaker changed from 6 to 5 individual buttons, removing the mute button and AUX button (The speaker changed to AUX automatically when it received a 3.5mm input) and added a multifunction button which could perform a variety of functions such as play, pause, and answer calls (due to the added speakerphone capability). The other major change to the series 2, was the change from DC charging to USB charging which provided a more convenient charging solution. The USB charging port also allowed the user to install software updates through btu.bose.com when available. The SoundLink Mini II was quietly discontinued in late 2018 in favour of the newly released Revolve and Revolve+, however due to high production numbers, it was still readily available as of late 2019.

The most surprising feature about the speaker is it can be charged without wire. It would be best if you bought another accessory – the Charging Cradle, which looks like a disc.

American Crystal is owned by nearly 2,800 shareholders who raise approximately one-third of the nation's sugarbeet acreage in the Red River valley of Minnesota and North Dakota. Additional acres are contracted in eastern Montana and western North Dakota. As the largest beet sugar producer in the United States, the company utilizes innovative farming practices, low-cost production methods, and sales and marketing leadership to produce and sell about 15 percent of America's sugar. American Crystal operates sugar factories in Crookston, East Grand Forks, and Moorhead, Minnesota; Drayton and Hillsboro, North Dakota; and Sidney, Montana, under the name Sidney Sugars Incorporated.

History ACS opened its Mason City, Iowa beet sugar factory in 1917 and closed it in 1973. It had come under pressure from the Iowa Water Pollution Control Commission for discharging waste into the Winnebago River and for air pollution, but it was also attributed to financial losses, a new factory at Renville, Minnesota, and fewer acres being grown. = Company Imposed Lockout = In August 2011, 96% of American Crystal Sugar employees rejected a pact that would have increased wages 13% over five years (2.5% per year) but which would have demanded greater worker contributions to health insurance coverage and major contract language givebacks, including fewer seniority rights. After five votes over a 20-month period, 55% of the members of the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers' International Union Local 167G ratified a contract that closely resembled the previous four proposals.

The complex was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 1, 1985 for its architectural significance. St. Mark's church is a Neogothic-styled building designed by A.H. James of Kansas City and built in 1900. It has walls of limestone with low buttresses on the south side. The front gable end features an apsidiole at the center at ground level, with a rose window above that and above that on the ridge a stone cross. The main entrance is through a large square corner tower. Inside, the church has a hammerbeam ceiling. The interior was redecorated in 1911, with a maple reredos, a high altar, carved lectern, pulpit and pews. A wood screen was also added, topped with a depiction of the Crucifixion carved by the Lang family of Oberammergau. With The frame \\"Guild Hall\\" north of the current church building was built in 1866-67 across the street by the first Methodist congregation in Oconto. Typical of that period, its style is Greek Revival, with returned cornices and tall windows. In 1894 St. Mark's bought the building and moved it to their site to replace their original building. Only six years later, St. Mark's had outgrown it and built their current church, eventually converting the old church to a social hall. At this point, St. Mark's Guild Hall is the oldest surviving church building in Oconto. What is now called the vicarage, north of the guild hall, was built in 1871 by lumberman Edward Fizgerald as his home. Over the years the house was expanded, including bay windows by later owner Edward Davis, a clothes merchant. St. Mark's acquired the building in 1913. Today the building is an interesting combination, with the half-turret bay window and siding suggesting Queen Anne style, but the jerkin gables and fine spindles on the porch suggesting other styles.

Restaurant kitchens often use large extractor hoods Kitchen ventilation equipment includes an extractor hood or canopy, and a filtering system. The system's fan may be located in the kitchen or in its ducts. Saturday, 25 May 2019  Requirements  An adequate kitchen ventilation system should: * Remove cooking fumes at the source, i.e. as close as possible to the cooking equipment. * Remove excess hot air and introduce cool clean air, maintaining a comfortable environment. Inadequate ventilation can cause stress, contributing to unsafe working conditions and high staff turnover. * Ensure that air movement in the kitchen does not cause discomfort. * Provide sufficient air for complete combustion at fired appliances, and prevent the risk of carbon monoxide accumulation. * Be easy to clean (intermittent e.g., manually, or continuously e.g. using ozone) so that fat residues do not accumulate in the hood and ducts and block air inlets, leading to loss of efficiency and increasing fire risk. * Be quiet and vibration-free. Kitchen ventilation design The design of an effective kitchen ventilation system is determined by: * The kitchen's workload * The amount, type and power of cooking equipment * The kitchen's layout and shape * The number of kitchen staff * The need for easy cleaning and maintenance * Energy efficiency Hot air from cooking is usually vented externally through a chimney system. When this is not possible, recirculating cooker hoods are used that clean the air and direct it back into the kitchen. Grease filters The most common types of grease filters used in professional kitchens are: * Water-based * Cyclonic * Ultraviolet (UV) * TurboSwing Comfort A comfortable kitchen is generally considered to have: * A temperature of 20 °C in winter and 28 °C in summer, with a maximum difference of 6 °C from the outside temperature * Relative humidity of approximately 70% * Air velocity less than 0.5 m/s (0.3 m/s in refrigerated areas) References Category:Ventilation Category:Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning Category:Kitchen ","title":"Kitchen ventilation"},{"id":"34468159","text":"Deesa Airport (also spelled Disa Airport), also known as Palanpur Airport, is an airport in Deesa, Gujarat originally built to serve the princely state of Palanpur.

The Airports Authority of India denied this was the case, stating that the airstrip was not used for the last 2 years, due to the poor condition of the airstrip, adding that it was fit only for paragliding. The airfield was most recently used for a sky diving program in 2013. In September 2011, A K Gogoi, Commander in Chief, South Western Air Command of the Indian Air Force announced that there was a proposal to develop Deesa Airport into a full fledged Air Base and that the Defence Ministry had approved this proposal. Deesa was chosen due to its strategic location, being close to the international border with Pakistan.

The genus is one of three genera in the subfamily Concavodontinae. Emiliodonta is known solely from late Ordovician, Caradocian epoch, fossils found in South America. The genus contains a single accepted species, Emiliodonta cuerdai. Description Emiliodonta cuerdai is a bivalve first described in 1999 by Teresa M. Sánchez from fossils from sediments of the late Middle Ordovician, Caradocian-aged Don Braulio Formation. The formation outcrops on the flank of Sierra de Villicum in the Argentina precordillera.The Paleobiology database \\"Sierra de Villicum\\" entry accessed 17 January 2012 Generally the shells of Emiliodonta cuerdai are rounded and distinctly inflated. The shells have an umbo positioned on the anterior edge of the shell prosogyratly, with the beak curving towards the anterior side. The shell hinges have a series of twelve to fourteen concavodont teeth along the posterior edge and a series of five larger concavodont teeth on the anterior edge. The two series meet at the umbo with a group of four to five orthomorphic teeth. Emiliodonta ranges in shell length from and has a height between . As a member of Concavodontinae, the hinge displays the chevroning of teeth typical of the subfamily. The teeth have a concavity in the chevron, which faces away from the center of the hinge and the umbo. When first described, the genus name Emiliania was chosen by Sánchez in reference to her father Emiliano Sánchez. However the genus name Emiliania is a homonym already used by W.W. Hay & H.P. Mohler in 1967 for a genus of coccolithophore. In a 2010 paper, Sánchez moved the species to the generic Emiliodonta name. The species epithet cuerdai was coined in honor of C. Cuerda, a professor at the Universidad de La Plata and friend of Teresa M. Sánchez.

History 29 May 1939 USSR Narcomzdrav (People's Commissariat of Health of the USSR) issued an order according to which Narcomzdravs of the union republics were to develop the plan of organizing medical library network and to create a fundamental library at each regional health department by the end of 1940. 1940 a separate budget and staff for the BSSR scientific medical library were approved. According to the order No. 98 of 10 March 1940 signed by Head of Minsk medical institute Shults F.Y., an outstanding bibliographer and founder of the library service in our country Simanovsky I.B. was appointed director of the State scientific medical library by Minsk medical institute. This is the day to be considered the day when the RSML was founded. During the first year only the collection of the library reached 15000 items. 1941 the Great Patriotic War interrupted work of the library. All the book stock was destroyed during occupation period. Only in 1944 the Republican scientific medical library of the BSSR Narcomzdrav headed by S.F.Sergeeva resumed its activity according to the BSSR Sovnarcom (Council of People's Commissars) special resolution No. 426. The most important point in the process of library restoration was undertaking functions of research and organization centre for all medical libraries in the republic. In April 1945 with the view of complete destruction of regional medical libraries during war the BSSR Narcomzdrav decreed to organize a regional medical library at each regional health department. Since 1954 the library has become a separate establishment and has been located in the building of Minsk regional clinical hospital in Podlesnaya street (isolated square of the library is 230 square metres). According to the BSSR Minzdrav (Ministry of Health) order No.488 10 August 1954 M.L.Zhuk was appointed director of the State scientific medical library. Since 1975 the library has become a republican branch depository. In a year the library moved to the building in Fabritsiusa street, 28 specially constructed for it which happened mostly thanks to the director L.N.Pogrebnaya. L.N.Pogrebnaya headed the RSML since 1968 until 1982. Under her supervision many reforms took place. The RSML started to receive a paid depository copy of medical literature, purchase all the medical journals issued in the USSR and most significant foreign periodicals. Many efforts were made to improve reference body as well as forms and methods of library services. In 1960-1980s the RSML developed into main centre of national medical bibliography, active research studies and library services. In 1990s modern computer technologies were introduced in the RSML. Ministry of Health of the Republic of Belarus approved the project of the Republican scientific medical library automation which includes automation of all library and information network processes, providing online access to the library's catalogues and free access to the global network Internet. It is hard to overestimate the role of E. F. Gorelova, the head of the library in 1982-2001, in automation process. In January 1995 the European Regional Bureau of the World Health organization decided to make the library the Centre of the WHO documentation on the territory of the Republic of Belarus. Today the RSML is transforming into modern information centre. Due to the financial support of the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Belarus extensive repairs of the library's building are carried out, modern library furniture and equipment are purchased. The functional structure of the library is reorganized. There is a single spot of document lending regardless of their storage location as well as free access room where the most valuable and up-to-date publications are presented. Since 2003 the head of the RSML has been V.N. Soroko. One of the important fields of work in the RSML is non-budgetary activity. According to the current legislation of the Republic of Belarus and rules of the RSML non- budgetary financial resources include: providing library and information services on a fee-paying basis, publishing and printing services, sponsor support, leasing services. Non-budgetary profit constitutes 1/3 the budgetary funding. Printing and publishing licenses as well as separate printing complex make it possible to provide the following services: issuance of science, reference and advertising publications; literary and technical editing, artistic design; preparing and copying small editions, printed blanks and presentation products, CD-ROM electronic databases. Since 2005 the RSML has been the member of Consortium of medical libraries in Russian and Belarus that aimed at carrying out the projects “Central catalogue of medical periodicals and analytics” and “Medical authoritative file “Health professionals in Russia” (with constituent part “Health professionals in Belarus”). In 2006 according to the order of the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Belarus No. 640 of 31.10.2005 Museum of History of Belarusian medicine became part of the library. The museum houses the exposition illustrating main periods of development of medicine in Belarus. It includes models, maquettes, dioramas, natural interior scenes and copies of unique documents. The RSML is a methodical and coordinating centre of 152 medical and hospital libraries in the republic including 112 libraries of medical preventive institutions, 21 libraries of medical universities and colleges, 10 libraries of republican scientific and practical centres and 8 libraries of health resort institutions. In 2005-2007 the first stage of the project “Creating a system of free access to national and international information resources in the RSML” was successfully carried out. The sponsor of the project was Danish pharmaceutical company “Novo Nordisk A/S”, which has been our friend for 10 years. As a result of project implementation there were established 9 modern points of access to global and national information resources. Now our users have free access to more than 25 international databases that reflect the global flow of medical information, including Russia and CIS countries; the access to Medical Library database of Proquest corporation, which contains full texts of 700 international journals on medicine and health care with deep retrospection and weekly (on-line access) and quarterly updates. Our users can order documents from the world's leading information centers on medicine and health care using telecommunications. Today RSML is the biggest information center on medicine and health care in Belarus. The library serves as national repository and republican depository of medical literature, interlibrary and international loan system, scientific-methodical and coordination center for medical libraries. The library work is aimed at formation and storage of information resources, satisfaction of needs of health care specialists and assistance in conducting of scientific research. In particular, the library, supported by the Ministry of Health, exploits medical scientific Internet portal MED.BY, which consists of 3 sites: *“ Health care and medicine of Belarus” ; *Online directory “Health care of Belarus” ; *All-day information service on availability of medical goods in the drugstores of Minsk . On the base of MED.BY portal resources the RSML releases a reference catalog “Health care of Belarus. Establishments, services and goods. Who is who”, which has been a desk book for health care managers and specialists, authorities and citizens of Belarus and other countries for many years. The library releases scientific, referential and advertising publications, including electronic variants; makes literary and technical editing, art design, preparation and copy-making of limited circulation materials, forms and presentation products. Information resources The library stock consists of more than 900 000 documents. There are such kinds of publications as author's abstracts and dissertations, books and booklets, journals and electronic documents on medicine, health care and neighboring areas in Belarusian, Russian, English, German and other languages. The stock of books consists of more than 350 000 copies, published in Belarus and abroad since the 19th century. The stock includes monographs, guides for practitioners, tutorials, atlases, seminar materials. The stock of books in foreign languages (English, German, French, Spanish) makes more than 21 000 documents; there are also documents in Bulgarian and Polish. The atlases “Single Surgical Procedures” from Wolfe Medical Publications, International Pharmacopoeia (4th edition), collection of books from Springer publishing house (2008) are represented in the library.

The area was first explored by Europeans in 1823 by the botanist and explorer Allan Cunningham. He discovered the pass on 9 June 1823 after searching for approximately from an easterly direction. The pass allowed an easy passage through the mountain range to the Liverpool Plains on the northern side of the mountain range. The exploration journey commenced from Bathurst in April 1823.

After realising the range was becoming more difficult he \\"halted on the verge of a perpendicular ravine, being unable to advance another mile to the eastward by reason of the sharp water gullies between which lay steep ravines\\". He returned to Mount Moan, the fruitless journey east costing three weeks and three days. They proceeded north west again searching for a passage through the Liverpool Range. After a further six days Cunningham decided to mount the western range and take his bearings. The view he obtained filled him with delight; for, on looking round him and tracing the line of the main northern range, he saw a considerable depression in the range, and writes: \\"it was a very low back in the main ridge distant about , and although limited, afforded me a clear view of the open plains north of this extensive barrier.\\" Cunningham named the pass Pandora's Pass, (now also known as Brennan's Gap) and that he \\"believed it would become the great route of communication between Bathurst and Hunter River and the Liverpool Plains.\\" He returned via present day Mudgee to the town of Bathurst arriving there on 27 June 1823 after an arduous eleven weeks travelling. Etymology In his diary Cunningham described the difficulties and many privations of finding this pass, and he says 'and in spite of these little evils - a hope at the bottom', he then names it Pandoras Pass. This is a reference to the Greek myth of Pandora's box, this myth refers to a vessel which contained all the evils of the world. When Pandora opened the jar, all its contents except for one item were released into the world. The one remaining item was hope. =Cunningham's diary= The following memorandum, written on parchment, was enclosed in a bottle, and buried under a marked tree in the Pandora Pass: See also * List of mountain passes in New South Wales References  External links  *Diary extract of Allan Cunningham - Gutenberg Australia Website *The Allan Cunningham Project - Website Category:Mountain passes of Australia Category:Central West (New South Wales) ","title":"Pandoras Pass"},{"id":"34468381","text":"Edmund Hooke Wilson Bellairs (1823–1896) was a member of the New Zealand Legislative Council.

The cryptotype is understood in opposition to the phenotype or overt category, namely a category that is overtly marked as such. Covert categories affect words' combinative power.LI Jian-ying (Literature Institute, Jilin University, Changchun 130012, China); A Brief Comment on Whorf's Theory of \\"Covert Category\\"[J]; Journal of Anhui TV University; 2003–04 British linguist Michael Halliday argued that Whorf's notion of the \\"cryptotype\\" and his conception of \\"how grammar models reality\\" will \\"eventually turn out to be among the major contributions of twentieth century linguistics\\". Halliday described the concept in the following way: \\"Whorf (1956) distinguished between overt and covert categories and pointed out that covert categories were often also “cryptotypes” — categories whose meanings were complex and difficult to access. Many aspects of clause grammar, and of the grammar of clause complexes, are essentially cryptotypic.\\"Halliday, M.A.K. & Matthiessen, C.M.I.M. (1999), Construing Experience Through Meaning: A Language-Based Approach to Cognition, London: Continuum, p. 569 Through the use of Halliday, the term has become important in Systemic functional linguistics. Whorf introduced the concept in his 1937 paper \\"Grammatical categories\\" notes that a letter from Whorf to Boas indicates the paper was written in 1937, but it was not published until 1945 in the journal \\"Language\\". Grammatical Categories Language, Vol. 21, No. 1 (Jan. – Mar., 1945), pp. 1–11 and based it on his belief that all grammatical categories must be in some way marked in language to be able to contribute to meaning. But Whorf noted that not all categories were marked overtly, and some were only marked overtly in exceptional cases, whereas in most or all cases their marking is covert. As an example he gave the English system of gender, where the gender of nouns only appears when the sentence employs a singular pronoun and has to choose between \\"he\\", \\"she\\" or \\"it\\". As long as no pronouns appear, the gender of the nouns are marked only covertly. The fact that a speaker has to know for each word whether the correct pronoun is \\"he\\", \\"she\\" or \\"it\\" shows that the nouns are in fact \\"marked\\" for gender — just not overtly so. Another example of a covert category given by Whorf was the Navajo language's system of noun classification by which all nouns were marked for a combination of animacy and shape. Whorf himself used the term \\"cryptotype\\" as separate from \\"covert category\\" to refer to \\"a special, highly concealed subdivision of covertness, amounting sometimes to a second degree of covertness\\". Whorf's point in distinguishing between phenotypes and cryptotypes was to show that it is easier for a speaker of a language to be consciously aware of his use of some categories, whereas other categories are so deeply ingrained in his consciousness that they are difficult, but not impossible, to become aware of.

Plot Krazy is at the second deck of his home, practicing his animated musical instruments, particularly a double bass. Still learning how to play, Krazy's performance is less than promising. Thus the other instruments at his back start to jeer at him. When the cat continues playing, the double bass, not liking his music, grabs his bow and shoves him off. Krazy then picks up another one, and the two engaged in a bow fight. The duel ends with the feline tossing the big violin out the window. Krazy goes on to discard his other instruments in a similar fashion for their disloyalty. Down on the pavement outside, the double bass tells the cat that they will return in a larger number and get back at him. To build up his battalion, the double bass and his associates parade on the street, calling for other instruments to join them. For every house they pass by, at least one comes out to go with the pack. In such a short period, a considerable number is reached, and they are ready to take on their feline foe. The army of musical instruments arrive at the vicinity of Krazy's place, and began firing their guns at the house. Despite the significant odds against him, Krazy takes a machine gun, and is able to shoot down much of the outside forces. Although they suffer numerous casualties, the instruments refuse to concede. They continue their gunfire until Krazy's house begins to crumble, but the feline is, nonetheless, unscathed. Closing in on the cat, one of the incoming attackers go for the coup de grace, only to receive a backfire. Instead of landing on Krazy, the projectile pierces a barrel of whiskey, causing it to spray its contents onto the last instruments still on the offensive. As a conclusion to the battle, the instruments are intoxicated, and they play a blues tune before finally succumbing. Krazy remains on his feet and therefore gets the last laugh.

It operates as a charity and NGO (non- governmental organisation). It evolved out of a lobbying group formed in 1780 to represent the interests of the plantocracy. Historically, the principal commodities of the region were cane sugar, rum, mahogany, other softwood, spices and tropical produce, early on largely confined to types which would last a long transatlantic voyage such as coffee, nuts and desiccated coconut but later expanded to include tropical fruits in general. London Society of West India Planters and Merchants The London Society of West India Planters and Merchants was established to represent the views of the British West Indian plantocracy. The organisation played a major role in resisting the abolition of the slave trade and that of slavery itself. The Society was formed in 1780, and brought together three different groups: British sugar merchants, absentee plantation owners and colonial agents. (See Sugar plantations in the Caribbean.) The society started with a predominantly Jamaican leadership, but as emancipation approached, by the 1830s the leadership came to include a broader ranger of planter interests from across the British Caribbean. The society evolved into the West India Committee. West India Committee In 1904, the committee received a royal charter of incorporation at the initiative of the British government. It later acquired charitable status and established two subsidiary bodies: *The Caribbean Council for Europe (CCE) *The Caribbean Trade Advisory Group (Caritag).West India Committee: Official Archives, 1899–1998 Among its records are for example eight collections of Caribbean and English newspapers 1761–1846, reports of the Acting Committee to the Half-Yearly Meeting of the Standing Committee of West India Planters and Merchants, 1878–1883 and albums of photographs and press cuttings on the 1907 Kingston earthquake in Jamaica, a country that was a major subject of its promotion work. The modern organisation The West India Committee exists to promote and support agriculture, manufacturing, and trade in the West Indies, Guyana and Belize, \\"to increase the general welfare of the people of those territories and their global diaspora through education, training, acting as an advocate, adviser and where necessary, as an umbrella organisation\\". It seeks to bring Caribbean businesses to the attention of the world's major markets. The Chief Executive is Blondel Cluff CBE, who is also the Anguilla government’s representative in the United Kingdom. Notable officers From at least 1915–1929 its Secretary was Algernon Aspinall, who, in the name of his committee, published geographical guides to Guyana and the British Caribbean, such as a 1907 Stanford's Guide: Pocket Guide to the West Indies and The Handbook of the British West Indies, British Guiana and British Honduras (1929). Sir Eliot de Pass served first as an ordinary member of the Committee, then as its chairman from 1925 to 1936, and finally as president until his death the following year.

The primary office and factory location is in Banbury, United Kingdom and there are also Norbar sales, service and calibration facilities in Australia, United States, New Zealand, Singapore, China and India. History Norbar Torque Tools was owned and run by the descendants of the founder, William (Bill) Brodey until acquired by Snap-on Inc. in May 2017. =1940s= In 1942, at the height of World War II, Bill Brodey was engaged in selling various tools and machines including Joseph Sunnen honing machines used for honing cylinder bores of engines. Torque wrenches were being imported and sold alongside of the honing machines because it was known that uneven torque tightening of engine cylinder head bolts would distort the cylinder bore. Bill and his friend Ernest Thornitt applied to the UK Ministry of Supply requesting permission to manufacture torque wrenches in the UK. Torque wrenches were much in demand for the manufacture of Rolls-Royce Merlin aero engines and the UK Government was keen to manufacture in the UK wherever possible to reduce pressure on the Atlantic supply convoys. Consequently, permission was granted to 'The North Bar Tool Company' to start manufacturing torque wrenches in 'North Bar Place', Banbury in the United Kingdom. The address 'North Bar' gave the company its name and this was later contracted to 'Norbar'. At the end of World War II the market for the Merlin aero engine dried up, along with all of the tools used in its manufacture. The North Bar Tool Company switched its attention to the manufacture of simple household goods like tables and trays. As industry recovered, 'North Bar Tools' went back its roots in the aerospace industry, manufacturing a range of specialist fitting tools, along with torque wrenches. =1950s= In 1952, Bill Brodey's eldest son Ian joined the company. Ian was a graduate in mechanical engineering from Loughborough College of Technology and brought a new level of professionalism to the company's engineering activity, producing drawings for all components for the first time and expanding the product range. In 1957, Bill's younger son John joined the North Bar Tool company as the first full-time salesman. In 1953 a project for the engineering company and bolt manufacturer GKNGKN Global Engineering Group Official Website “” took the North Bar Tool Company in a new product direction. GKN had designed a bolt that had a splined section above the nut. By gripping the splined section of the bolt and counter rotating the nut, the fastener could be tightened without the need for any external reaction device. In a further development, a shear groove was placed below the spline, so designed that the bolt would fail at the groove when the pre- determined torque had been achieved. This bolting method was known as 'Torshear'. GKN required an air-driven tool capable of high torque output to sell with their 'Torshear' bolts. Probably Britain's best-known gearbox designer of the time was Dr. Henry Edward MerrittEureka Magazine Article entitled 'Epicyclics-take-more-torque' “” Retrieved from Internet Archive. and so Dr. Merritt was contracted to design a suitable range of air-driven gearboxes for the Torshear application. The Torshear bolting method was not a commercial success, so 'North Bar' added reaction arms to their gearboxes and called them 'Pneutorque' in the case of the air-driven versions, and the hand- operated versions were named 'Handtorque'. Evolutions of these products still form part of the company's range today.Norbar Torque Official website – Products page “” Dr. Merritt's book 'Gears' remains a reference for gearbox designers. =1960s= Another Dr. Merritt design was the 'Slimline' torque wrench mechanism. Prior to the 'Slimline', all Norbar torque wrenches used an external, break-back mechanism. The 'Slimline' was the first Norbar design to completely contain the mechanism within the body tube of the wrench, hence the 'Slim' reference. The 'Slimline' torque wrench was launched in 1963 and some models remain in production today. Variations in this mechanism underpin most of Norbar's current torque wrenches. Norbar has manufactured torque testers for almost as long as they have manufactured wrenches. The earliest types employed a simple spring balance attached to a pivoted bar. The next evolution was to utilise a hydraulic cell and hydraulically activated gauge. The 'Static Torque Meter' was much more compact than the earlier versions and were easier to use because this system avoided the needle fluctuations of the spring balance type. This product enjoyed a near 50 year life span before finally being rendered obsolete by electronic measurement methods. The first reference to a Norbar electronic torque analyser is dated 1967. The display unit, incorporating an analogue gauge similar to a Voltmeter, was attached by a cable to a separate, strain gauged torque transducer. Forty five years later, this essentially remains the method of measuring torque although the electronics are now based on single-board computer technology with such features as colour display and touch sensitive screen. Norbar premises in Banbury 1969 saw the company's first address change bringing with it the official change in name from 'The North Bar Tool Company' to 'Norbar' (which had previously been used as a telegraphic address). The new premises on Swan Close, Banbury, were originally 9,000 sq.ft but were extended twice before being outgrown and Norbar moved again to Beaumont Road, Banbury in 1984. A major extension to this site in 1989 took the floor area to 45,000 sq.ft and further extensions and mezzanine work give a total of 52,000 sq.ft of production and office space. In March 2012 Norbar exchanged contracts with Hella Ltd to purchase its 170,000 sq ft Wildmere Road site in a move that saw Norbar relocate completely in July 2016 and Hella move to new premises in the Banbury area. Calibration laboratory In November 1989, Norbar became the first torque tool manufacturer in the United Kingdom to have a torque laboratory accredited by the governmental, third party body National Measurement Accreditation Service (NAMAS). In 1995 the non-profit distributing private company United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS)UKAS official website was formed and took over this accreditation role. Norbar's laboratory, number 0256, has an accredited calibration scope from 0.005 Nּm to 108,500 Nּm. Global offices and calibration laboratories Since 1996 Norbar has been establishing overseas offices for the purpose of product distribution and service. Norbar Torque Tools Pty. Ltd in Australia was the first and was then followed by the United States, New Zealand, Singapore and China. On 1 January 2012, Norbar's wholly owned trading and service company opened for business in Mumbai, India. The companies in Australia, USA, Singapore and China each have a calibration laboratory with a similar scope of ability to the UKAS accredited laboratory in the United Kingdom. Each of these laboratories has accreditation by a local third party body; NATAnata.asn.au; National Association of Testing Authorities, Australia. in the case of Australia, NVLAPnist.gov; National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program for USA, SAC-SINGLASSingapore Accreditation Council for Singapore and TAF for China.

Kong Qingdong called Hong Kong people \\"dogs\\" in response to an online video posted about a mainland Chinese child eating on the subway, which is prohibited by MTR regulations. This prompted a series of campaigns against Kong Qingdong in Hong Kong. About 150 people gathered at the Central Government's Liaison Office on 22 January to protest Kong's remarks. The protests took place among a backdrop of increasing tensions between native citizens of Hong Kong and mainlanders, including the release of a survey indicating that Hong Kong people feel increasingly separate from, and superior to, Mainland Chinese people. At the time of the protests, anti-Mainland Chinese sentiment in Hong Kong had been growing because of the large influx of mainland Chinese mothers arriving in Hong Kong to give birth, largely for their children to receive right of abode in Hong Kong and the social services that came with it. Background =Cultural identity= Since 1997, University of Hong Kong professor Robert Chung () had been regularly conducting surveys on how residents in Hong Kong view their own identity. Of particular significance was the comparison between Hong Kong residents who preferred to be identified primarily as \\"Hong Kong people\\" as opposed to \\"Chinese\\", largely as a result of many Hong Kong'ers harbouring cultural and political values that were seen as distinct from those of China at large. In December 2011, Chung's poll showed that 63% of the people considered themselves \\"Hong Kongers\\" first, and only 34% thought of the same way of being \\"Chinese\\" first. This is the highest ratio of those who consider themselves primarily as \\"Hong Kong people\\" () since the transfer of sovereignty to China in 1997. After Chung published his results, two pro-Beijing newspapers in Hong Kong, Wen Wei Po and Ta Kung Pao alleged that Chung was a \\"political fraudster\\" with \\"evil intentions\\" to incite people to deny they are Chinese. One pro-Beijing columnist asked whether Chung's actions were subversive, and whether his scholarship was the result of political bribery. Chung rejected the charges of bias and released a statement that the \\"Cultural Revolution- style curses and defamations are not conducive to the building of Chinese national identity among Hong Kong people\\". Professor Dixon Sing () of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology was also targeted by pro-Beijing media. In December 2011 newspapers alleged that he was an anti-China \\"Western- trained vicious dog\\" because he gave interviews to Falun Gong media. But the real issue, some suspect, may have his support for the 2010 \\"Five Constituencies Referendum,\\" a set of by-elections deliberately triggered by pan-democrat politicians intended to showcase the Hong Kong public's endorsement of democratic reforms in the territory. The Students' union have since come out to protect professor Sing in a public statement about the \\"one country, two systems\\" policy being violated. They believed that regardless of pro-establishment or pro-democratic views, the views need to be respected in order for academic freedom to exist.Student Union statement in pdf =Influx of birth tourism= On 1 January 2012 a protest was held by more than 1,500 pregnant women and mothers with strollers against the number of Mainland Chinese mothers giving birth in the Hong Kong. In 2001, the Court of Final Appeal ruled in Director of Immigration v. Chong Fung Yuen that Hong Kong-born children of Chinese citizens were entitled to the right of abode in Hong Kong even if their parents had entered the territory as tourists. This ruling led to a sharp rise in the number of Mainland Chinese mothers coming to Hong Kong to give birth. In 2011, nearly half of all babies born in Hong Kong (38,043 out of 80,131) were born to Mainland Chinese mothers. Hong Kong has one of the world's lowest birth rates, so the wave of outsiders' giving birth in Hong Kong hospitals put a significant strain on health care resources in the territory. Nurses in the region have accused the territory's government of incompetence, and lobbied for Hong Kong residents to be prioritised over non- locals. In 2012, the Hong Kong government reduced the quota for the number of Mainland Chinese women allowed to give birth in public hospitals. The quota call was made after doctors themselves made a rare public call to pressure the government to put a stop on the number of babies allowed as resources were stretched too thin. The cap is now set at 3,400 for public and 31,000 for private hospitals. Chief Executive Donald Tsang announced a four-point plan to hold back the wave of Mainland Chinese 'birth tourists.' Heavy charges were imposed on non-locals who turn up at emergency stops to give birth immediately. The Immigration Department was allotted more resources at border checks to stop suspected mothers looking to give birth in the territory before they cross the border. Local authorities were also asked to crack down on people who assist women who enter the territory for the purpose of giving birth. More raids were to be conducted on unlicensed hotels serving pregnant women. About HK$6.6 million (~US$850,000) of public hospitals' bad debt in 2010–11 was from non-local mothers not paying their bills.South China morning post. 20 January 2012. Tsang vows to curb mainland birth tourism. =Property investment= Many Hong Kong citizens blame wealthy Mainland Chinese for driving property prices beyond the reach of local citizens. In 2011 Mainland Chinese purchased a third of all residential flats in Hong Kong, according to Nomura research. Home prices also rose as much as 70% since 2009. Incident =\\"Child eating on subway\\" controversy= In January 2012, Ken Wai, a Hong Kong passenger, asked a Mainland Chinese woman and her child to stop eating on an MTR subway in Mandarin Chinese on a train bound for Mong Kok East Station.South China morning post. 21 January 2012. HK people labelled as dogs by mainlander. Eating and drinking is prohibited on the MTR. While the kid stopped eating, the mother reacted with hostility towards Wai. This infuriated Mr. Wai, who began to shout at them passionately in Cantonese. The mother of the child argued back in Mandarin. The subway staff was forced to stop the train, and ask both parties to disembark from the train to resolve their dispute. Videos of the dispute were recorded, then uploaded to online video- sharing websites such as YouTube, quickly going viral. On 18 January Mr. Wai conducted an interview with Xinhua News Agency on the issue and expressed his anger. Kong Qingdong's remarks The incident was seen as the result of wider on-going social tensions between Hong Kong people and mainlanders at the time. It garnered a wide range of responses, of which the most notable came from Kong Qingdong, a professor at Peking University known for his vulgar commentary of political and social issues as well as his firebrand Chinese nationalism. Commenting on video-sharing website v1.cn, Kong remarked, \\"You Hong Kong'ers are Chinese, right? But as far as I can tell, many Hong Kong people don't think that they are Chinese. They claim that 'we' are Hongkongers, 'you' are Chinese. They are bastards. Those kinds of people used to be running dogs for the British colonialists. And until now, you Hong Kong'ers are still dogs. You aren't human.\\" Kong then claimed that Hong Kong residents had failed to accept their responsibility to speak the \\"real Chinese language [i.e., Mandarin Chinese]\\" because of the \\"residues of colonialism\\". He then threatened \\"If Hong Kong people continue to discriminate against Mainlanders in that way, then we won't provide the territory with water, vegetables, fruit and rice [...] Can you Hong Kong'ers still survive? Go to seek help from your British daddy.\\" Kong's remarks were widely publicized and quickly courted controversy; responding to criticism of his remarks, Kong Qingdong claimed that he made the remarks for Hong Kong people's benefit, and that he only called \\"some\\" Hong Kong people dogs. According to Ming Pao, Kong claimed that \\"normal people, educated people should all understand what [he] meant\\", and that \\"there are 'dogs' everywhere. Some Beijing people are dogs. If someone really says that all Hong Kong people are dogs, then I agree, that person should apologize. Since the only party claiming that Hong Kong people are dogs is Southern Daily. I demand that they apologize to both the Hong Kong people and me!\\" The online video network that published Kong's remarks later claimed that Kong's views do not represent those of the network. Protests Many Hong Kong citizens were infuriated by Kong's remarks, and Hong Kong's Open magazine openly asked for Kong to banned from entering Hong Kong, as well as suggesting that the Communist Party of China has been supporting Kong Qingdong behind the scenes. Petitions for expelling Kong from Peking University, which was previously called for when he rejected an interview with the liberal Chinese newspaper Southern Weekly with a slew of profanities, was also renewed. On 22 January 2012, about 150 protesters gathered at the Central Government's Liaison Office to protest against Kong Qingdong's statement. People brought their pet dogs and carried signs saying \\"We are not dogs\\". Some protesters claimed that Hong Kongers dislike the Communist Party precisely because the Party had, in their views, deformed 'true' Chinese culture and tradition. Reaction =Kong Qingdong= Kong criticised the protest as \\"an attempt to suppress (his) freedom of speech through government action\\". Chinese reaction to Kong's remarks had been divided; while some criticised his insult on the Hong Kong people, others have expressed support for Kong. =Hong Kong electoral candidates= Both candidates in the running for Chief Executive of Hong Kong, Henry Tang and Leung Chun-ying, criticised Kong's public statement. Henry Tang responded by saying professor Kong needs to be responsible for his own statement and that Hong Kong citizens are not dogs. He emphasised this is how Hong Kong citizens deal with each other in a free society. On the other hand, Leung Chun-ying said that Kong's statement did not actually reflect the views of Mainland Chinese. He added that this is part of the Hong Kong spirit to respect the law, and that Kong Qingdong should not be over-reacting. =Other notable responses= * The prominent Chinese artist and dissident Ai Weiwei complained about Peking University's tolerance of Kong Qingdong's behaviour, calling Peking University \\"a nest of turtles\\". * Susan Tse, a Hong Kong opera actress and a fellow descendant of Confucius, criticised Kong Qingdong's \\"lack of tolerance and respect\\" of the Hong Kong people. Tse further suggested that Kong should apologise to the Hong Kong people. * The Chinese scholar and television personality Yi Zhongtian criticised Kong's remarks, calling Kong's characterisation of speakers of non- Mandarin Chinese dialects as \\"bastards\\" an \\"affront to thousands of millions of non-Mandarin speakers in China\\", and as such Yi would \\"rather be a bastard than agree with Kong.\\" * The Hong Kong actor Anthony Wong also rebuked Kong's remarks, suggesting that \\"if the Hong Kong people are dogs, then Kong Qingdong is a blood relative of dogs\\". * An analysis was done by yzzk (Asia magazine), who gave many examples of popular YouTube links showing Mainland Chinese misbehaving every day in Hong Kong causing anger. It also highlight many \\"Chinese events\\" such as fight for democracy during the 1989 protest, help with activists in need, help with territorial dispute (Diaoyutai islands), disaster relief (2008 Sichuan earthquake) and many more events that HK citizens participated in and were overlooked. * Jack So, former MTR chairman and CPPCC member who was born in Taiwan, said \\"We are all the same, we are all Chinese with the same surnames.\\" Advertisement controversy The highly controversial advertisement paid for by Hong Kong citizens, depicting Mainlanders as locusts on Apple Daily =Anti-Mainland Chinese advertisements= Members of the Hong Kong Golden Forum raised more than HK$100,000 to purchase a full-page advertisement in Apple Daily. The advertisement was published on Wednesday 1 February 2012 and featured a giant locust overlooking the city skyline of Hong Kong. Locusts stereotypically represent Mainland Chinese. The ad makes the statement \\"Would you like to see Hong Kong spend HK$1 million every 18 minutes on the children of non-Hong Kongers? Hong Kongers have had enough! We strongly demand a stop to the unlimited infiltration of Mainland couples into Hong Kong.\\" The advertisement also employs the derogative term \\"double illegitimacy\\" (雙非), which refers to residents of Hong Kong with both parents of illegal status within the territory. Protesters also argued against Hong Kong Basic Law Article 24, although Rita Fan have already said these newborns do not qualify for right of abode. Hong Kong protesters also launched anti-Mainland Chinese groups on Facebook that reached high popularity, prompting local media to refer to it as an \\"Anti-Locusts campaign\\". At least one entry on Sina microblog has been reposted 97,000 times and received 30,000 comments according to the Global Times. The Hong Kong Equal Opportunities Commission expressed concern over the full-page advertisement; Chairman Lam Woon-kwong said that vilifying remarks will heighten social tension and hostility and called for tolerance and rational debate. =Mainland Chinese response= Mainland Chinese microblogs launched a retaliatory advertisement against the locust slur, claiming that \\"if it wasn't the mainland Chinese treating you like a son, you would have died long ago. We must not allow this son (Hong Kong) to ride on our shoulders anymore. Let's temporarily cut off the son's water, electricity and food!\\" =Copycat advertisement in Shanghai= A similarly duplicate ad by Shanghai grassroots reused the same picture posted from the HK golden forum, but the words were changed. This copycat ad claims 4 billion RMB is spent each year to subsidise non-locals in Shanghai. In Shanghainese dialect it declares \\"Shanghainese have had enough. Because you have come for the gold rush, we have to receive 17,566,700 outsiders.\\" Additional controversy =Democracy wall= Around 7 Feb, at the Democracy wall of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, large characters appeared inscribing the words in Chinese characters: \\"Anti-Locusts\\" (反蝗蟲). The case have been under investigation. Some students believe this type of vandalism on the democracy wall is just a response to Mainland Chinese society not tolerating democracy. =Tension extends to university= The tension between HK and Mainland China has extended to universities where between 2010 and 2011 Mainland Chinese students were granted 2/3 of the scholarships. There were limited resources available to begin with, now these HK citizens have to compete with Mainland Chinese for education, scholarships and jobs post study. Chinese University of Hong Kong vice-Chancellor Joseph Sung have recognised the uneasiness about the situation. The cultural differences also add to the tension where many students from HK and Mainland China can't live together in some campuses.爭宿舍獎學金 中港矛盾延大學language. =Tension extends to Singapore= A Mainland Chinese student Sun Xu (孫旭) from Jiangsu province under Chinese government scholarship at the National University of Singapore wrote a message \\"in Singapore there are more dogs than humans\\" on internet forums. Sun Xu faced disciplinary actions and the Chinese embassy apologised for the comment. Sun Xu's comment is said to be influenced by Kong Qingdong. While the comment has raised many issues, some people have agreed. A comment followed by a Mr. Lin who said \\"Singaporeans are Descendants of Yan and Yellow Emperor who bleed Chinese blood. There is no need to rename a Chinese into a Singaporean.\\" =Conflict between Hong Kong and Mainland Chinese reporters= On 10 March 2012, a press conference on the issue of Mainland Chinese \\"birth tourism\\" Kong was held by Guangdong governor Zhu Xiaodan. As the conference was about to end, RTHK reporter Chan Liu-ling asked for Hong Kong reporters to be given a chance to ask questions. Instead the host let reporter Lu Hong-chao from Hong Kong Commercial Daily (owned by the Mainland-Chinese Shenzhen Press Group) ask the last question. As Lu is a Mainland Chinese, some Hong Kong reporters were unhappy and said \\"He isn't from Hong Kong\\". After the press conference, a fight broke out between Lu and TVB reporter Cheng Sze-ting. Lu, who thought that Cheng made the comment, reportedly started the fight, pushing her and pulling her journalist pass from her chest. When Lu Hong-chao attempted to leave, Cheng Sze-ting, Chan Miu-ling and other Hong Kong reporters surrounded him and requested an apology. At the time other Mainland Chinese reporters joined the quarrel and questioned whether Cheng was discriminating against Mainland Chinese, despite the Mainland Chinese host of the press conference host picking on Mainland Chinese during the Q&A; session.

History As soon as aircraft developed to the stage that they would stay airborne for predictable amounts of time, pilots started to pit their skills and aircraft against each other both personally and on a national and international basis. The earliest air races attracted an international audience and large cash prizes were offered for the winners. Perhaps the epitome of this would be the Schneider Trophy. As aircraft became more diverse, handicapping was adopted in Britain to level the playing field. The first handicapped race was held in 1922, sponsored by King George V—the King’s Cup. In 1931 the rules were re-written to allow amateur pilots to compete in standard production aircraft. Those rules still apply today, with some minor modifications and the King’s Cup remains the only air race to receive royal patronage. Handicapped air racing was a British phenomenon, although latterly the concept has been used to stage air races worldwide. Racing season A typical handicapped air racing season comprises some eight venues and 16 races: the maximum points available for a win in each race is 100 on a sliding scale. The British Air Racing Champion is the winner of this cumulative championship. Since 1952, the annual British Air-Racing Champion has been awarded the Jubilee Trophy: a silver cup. The runner-up is awarded the Brian McBride Trophy: a silver bowl on a wooden plinth. The annual Champion Navigator is awarded the Gaelic Hunter Trophy: a figure of a Gaelic hunter with his dog.

Set in the Joseon Dynasty, it centers around Hwa-yeon (Jo Yeo-jeong), who becomes a royal concubine against her will, Kwon-yoo (Kim Min-joon), a man torn between love and revenge, and Prince Sung-won (Kim Dong-wook), who has his heart set on Hwa-yeon despite the countless women available to him. These three characters form a love triangle which is ruled by dangerous passion. The struggle to survive within the tight-spaced boundaries of the palace is intense, and only those who are strong enough to overcome the hell-like milieu can survive. Plot Set during the early Joseon Dynasty, the film begins with a concubine of the previous king (Park Ji-young) in a precarious position of having no blood ties to her step son, the current childless, widow king (Jung Chan). She schemes to replace him on the throne with her submissive young son Sung-won (Kim Dong-wook). Indifferent to his mother's plans, the timid prince falls in love at first sight with Hwa-yeon (Jo Yeo-jeong), an aristocrat's daughter, who has already found love with Kwon-yoo (Kim Min-joon), a low-born commoner. When her father (Ahn Suk-hwan) must send her to the royal palace as a concubine for the king, the two lovers try to elope but are caught after their first night together. Hwa-yeon agrees to enter the palace in exchange for saving Kwon-yoo's life. Five years later, Hwa-yeon has become the Queen from giving birth to a son. Sung-won comes back from traveling to see the King upon hearing of his ill-health. In a private conversation, Sung-won gifts a hair stick to Hwa-yeon as a present and confession of his feelings. The king dies of a mysterious illness, and the former concubine sits her son, Prince Sung- won, on the throne as a puppet king, naming herself Regent and Queen Mother and taking firm control over the royal court. Hwa-yeon is moved to a closely watched, humble residence, where she is under surveillance constantly. When Hwa-yeon's father, a royal court minister, attempts to prove that the previous king died from poisonous assassination, he and all of the ministers disloyal to the queen mother are arrested for treason. Hwa-yeon discovers her former lover, Kwon-yoo, working in the castle among the eunuchs. Initially glad to see him, she reaches out for comfort and assistance, hoping some of their original feelings remain. Though his life was spared, Kwon-yoo was castrated by Hwa-yeon's father for daring to elope with her and he is now resentful and embittered towards both of them. Kwon-yoo has aligned himself with Minister Yoon and the Queen Mother to find power in his new position and rebuffs Hwa- yeon. Hwa-yeon's efforts to free her father and rescue him from execution are sabotaged by Kwon-yoo, who directly undermines Sung-won's exoneration orders to ensure the man's death. Kwon-yoo agrees to assassinate Hwa-yeon and her child with a block of poisonous aconite received from Minister Yoon by the orders of the Queen Mother, who wishes to secure her position and remove Hwa- yeon from influencing Sung-won. Sung-won is still very attracted to Hwa-yeon, bestowing favors and attention. In a fit of pique, he takes Geum-ok, Hwa- yeon's personal maid, as a minor concubine so he can inquire about Hwa-yeon's private habits. One night, Sung-won enters Geum-ok's room and is frothed into a rage when he sees her wearing the hair stick he had gifted to Hwa-yeon. To save her own life, Geum-ok reveals that Kwon-yoo had a relationship with Hwa- yeon, and that the young prince had been born prematurely, making his parentage suspect. Sung-won confronts Hwa-yeon, accusing her of hiding her lover as a fake eunuch, but dismisses the accusations after pulling down Kwon- yoo's pants to reveal his castration. Sung-won attempts to rape Hwa-yeon, but Hwa-yeon shoves him off and tells him to \\"come back when you become a true King.\\" After this incident, Kwon-yoo believes that he is the father of Hwa- yeon's child from the night they eloped together and has a change of heart about helping her, swearing to protect her and her son at any cost. In order to place his son on the throne and place a trap for the Queen Mother and King, Kwon-yoo turns on Minister Yoon by placing the poison in Sung-woo's medicinal drink. However, Kwon-yoo is left with no choice but to drink his own concoction to allay suspicion from Hwa-yeon and his child. After Kwon-yoo's violent reaction to the poisonous medicinal drink, the interrogated physician admits that Minister Yoon, who is directly beneath the Queen Mother, is head of medicine. Hwa-yeon has sent her son away for his safety and been imprisoned by the Queen Mother, who charges Hwa-yeon with treason and orders Minister Yoon to end both the mother and son's life. Sung-won accuses his mother of trying to poison him, leading to her admission that she had poisoned the previous king to place Sung-won on the throne, which horrifies him since he had loved his brother and never desired to be king. Kwon-yoo and Minister Yoon are brought in to confirm or deny the plot to poison the current king. Keeping his promise to Hwa-yeon to protect her and her son, Kwon-yoo lies, saying the Queen Mother was behind Sung-woo's assassination attempt, with Minister Yoon providing the poison. Sung-woo orders the men's execution and for the Queen Mother to be permanently placed under house arrest in her chambers. In a carriage heading towards his execution, Kwon-yoo says his goodbyes and asks Hwa-yeon to protect their son after he dies, but Hwa-yeon replies \\"Our son? The prince is no one's son. He is my son.\\" Kwon-yoo is devastated he has sacrificed his life for Hwa-yeon's child, who may not be his own, and Hwa-yeon has her revenge for her father's death. Sung-woo, now a true king, is greeted in his room by Hwa-yeon and the two engage in sexual intercourse before Hwa- yeon kills him. Queen Mother is quickly disposed of after him. The last scene shows Hwa-yeon smiling at her son playing on the throne in the empty royal court, before her face turns when the door shuts and she realizes she can't go back.

Box office Released on June 6, 2012, the film sold 1.4 million tickets in its first 10 days, and by the end of the month it had easily passed the 2 million admissions mark. The Korean Film Council reports that it sold more than 2.6 million tickets, making it the eleventh most watched Korean film of 2012.

It ran for 100 days and was declared a Blockbuster. Plot Prema (Isha Chawla) is the darling daughter of an honest and strict police officer (Nassar), but she is currently being blackmailed by one person (Shafi). Prema’s tension catches the eye of her sister-in-law (Sindhu Tolani) and this reveals a flashback. The story is about Srinu (Aadi), Prema’s classmate and his love for her. However, Prema doesn’t respond to his love feelings, but becomes friends with him. But in an unexpected situation, Srinu kisses Prema and this makes her hate Srinu and that becomes the cause of her worries. Those photos are used by the blackmailer saying that he would mail them to her father. This makes Prema's sister-in-law go to Srinu's Home in Khammam, where Srinu returns from Training of N.C.C.. He, after listening the whole story, vows to solve all the problems and goes to Hyderabad. Though initially it becomes difficult for Srinu to investigate, he later appoints a chain snatcher named Chain Raja (Ali) and tells him to follow her and give him updates. Meanwhile, it is revealed to the audience that the actual man behind this blackmail is Tagore (Dev Gill), a dreaded mafia don who wants a terrorist released from the prison on the orders of terrorist groups, whose in-charge is Prema's Father. Then Chain Raja watches Prema carrying a sum of money to an old house where the blackmailer is in disguise. He takes the sum of money, gives the photos, and cleverly gets the password of Prema's father's e-mail ID in which the terrorist's imprisonment details are held. Before Tagore's henchmen would snatch the photos from Prema, Srinu saves her and they burn the photos. Later, Prema starts loving Srinu and Tagore implements an escape plan to make the terrorist get released from the prison. The whole blame is on Prema's father and he confronts Prema, which makes her confess the truth. Being the person loving her and as an N.C.C. trainee, Srinu dares to chase Tagore and the terrorist. In a fight, Srinu kills Tagore and the terrorist is sent to police custody. Later, Srinu goes to the place where he kissed Prema and finds her waiting for him. The film ends with a scene featuring Srinu and Prema confessing their love for each other.

The Hall is adjacent to All Saints Church and is very close to the centre of the village. History The original manor house on the site of Lawshall Hall dates from at least the eleventh century when it belonged to Ramsey Abbey at Ramsey. An agreement was drawn up between the Abbot of Ramsey and William Herberd in 1269 that required Herberd to provide for the widow of Alexander Hemning, the tenant of Lawshall Hall, and her two sons. Herberd was to \\"maintain the sons and land in as good or better state than when he first had access to the wife of Alexander\\". After the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1534 the Manor of Lawshall, including Lawshall Hall, was granted to John Rither for 13 years and then in 1547 was sold to Sir William Drury. The Drurys of Hawstead were a very important family in the district and over the years several members of the family had distinguished connections with the Royal Family. It is possible that these connections brought about the visit of Queen Elizabeth I to Lawshall in 1578. Queen Elizabeth I visited Henry Drury at Lawshall Hall during her \\"Royal Progress\\" tour in August 1578. The Lawshall parish register records that: :\\"It is to be remembred that the queens highnesse, in her progresse, ....dined at Lawshall Hall, to the great rejoycing of ye said Parish, and the Country thereabouts.\\" The queen was met with an impressive welcoming committee led by the High Sheriff of Suffolk, Sir William Spring: :\\"There were two hundred young gentlemen, clad all in white velvet, and three hundred of the graver sorte, apparelled in black velvet coates, and fair chaynes, all ready at one instant and place, with fifteen hundred serving men more, on horseback, well and bravely mounted, in good order, ready to receive the queens highness into Suffolk, which was surely a comely troop, and a noble sight to behold.\\" For the small village of Lawshall, this would have indeed been a day to remember. The preparations at Lawshall were made by Richard Conysbie, 'Extraordinary' Gentleman Usher who was not on the regular staff. He must have been in attendance on other duties and assembled a nine-man team to provide some temporary help for the two regular ushers. Henry Drury entertained and fed her entourage at lunch, after which the queen asked that he pledge his loyalty to the throne, denounce his faith, and acknowledge the crown as the spiritual head of the church. Henry Drury would have certainly pledged his life to defend the queen, but would not renounce his church, and was arrested on the spot. When Elizabeth called next on his nephew Sir William Drury that evening at Hawstead Place, Hawstead, Sir William converted and thus secured his politically correct position with the crown. In contrast, Henry was imprisoned for six months, and was in prison off and on for the next three years. The hall was much larger than it is today with the Hearth Tax Return of 1674 listing the property as having 14 hearths. Architecture Lawshall Hall is a mid sixteenth century red brick house with some blue brick diapering, built on a T shaped plan, with the older wing extending north-west. The house may have been part of an old monastery and has massive brick walls approximately 6 feet thick in places. Part of the original wall is apparent at the north-west end of the front wing, with 2 small stone framed windows and a Tudor arched doorway. The house has been greatly altered and was refronted on the south- west elevation in the nineteenth century with 3 window range of double-hung sashes. The north-east wing has some original mullioned and transomed windows but has been partly blocked. The roof was tiled in the twentieth century. The house is dated 1557 with the arms of the Drury's. Recent history and present day Lawshall Hall has stood empty since the 1950s and has been defined as ‘at risk’ by English Heritage on their Heritage at Risk Register. For many years the hall was part of a working farmyard but most of the farm buildings have now been removed. In 2005 the roof of the hall was re-roofed and chimneys re-pointed. Lawshall Hall, standing in 53 acres of grounds, woodland and farmland, is currently the subject of a major restoration scheme which will restore the building to residential use and safeguard the heritage of this important building. Folklore A tunnel is said to have run from Lawshall Hall to the 16th century Coldham Hall in Stanningfield, a mile to the north. This mansion was built in 1574 by Robert Rookwood, whose son Ambrose Rookwood was a co-conspirator with Guy Fawkes.

The Istituto Garuzzo per le Arti Visive (IGAV) is a non-profit organisation, established in 2005, funded and managed by his family with the object of supporting contemporary art and specifically to help young emerging Italian artists to become known in the international arena.  The Olivetti/General Electric period  Garuzzo received a degree in Electronic Engineering after following the first graduation course in the than new discipline at the Politecnico di Torino (Polytechnic University of Turin) in November 1961, and joined the Laboratorio di Ricerche Elettroniche Olivetti in Borgolombardo, near Milan, where a host of researchers and engineers were developing the first family of Italian mainframe computers, a business idea of the visionary entrepreneur Adriano Olivetti. He worked on the Olivetti Elea 9003 and 6001 computers that allowed the first approach to informatics of more than 100 Italian large companies. When Olivetti was forced by supporting financial institutions to sell its electronic division to General Electric, Giorgio Garuzzo followed, working at Pregnana Milanese laboratories of General Electric Information System Italia (GEISI) as chief of the engineering planning department on the new computer generations GE115 and GE130, to be sold in some 5.000 units across the world.  The Fiat period  In 1973 Garuzzo joined Gilardini, a listed holding company managed by a maverick entrepreneur, Carlo De Benedetti, who Gianni Agnelli, the charismatic Fiat chairman, suddenly and unexpectedly hired in 1976 as “amministratore delegato” (chief executive officer) of the Fiat group, the largest Italian private enterprise that employed at the time more than 300.000 people. When De Benedetti stayed in Fiat a mere 100 days, Giorgio Garuzzo, who had followed him as his personal advisor, remained 20 years, orchestrating some of the most important achievements of the Group in the period. In a book published in 2006 (\\"Fiat - I segreti di un'epoca\\")\\"Fiat – I segreti di un’epoca\\", Roma 2006, Fazi publ. he describes the events and realisations of his Fiat experience, in the context of the Italian social and economical environment of the period 1976-1996. In 1977 he promoted the merging of seven machine tools firms to create Comau SpA, a company specialized in welding equipment, whose “robogate” computerized and flexible manufacturing system (FMS) was to be widely used since the ‘80s to assemble cars by many makes all over the world. Between 1979 and 1984, heading the Fiat Component Sector, Giorgio Garuzzo re-organized and managed more than 50 companies in the field of components for automotive and industrial applications, including promoting the development of the multi- point electronic controlled gasoline fuel injection system of Magneti Marelli SpA (the first European alternative to the offer from the German company Bosch), a product which gradually substituted the Weber carburators, which had been very successful in the past, but were becoming obsolete because less apt to fuel saving and emission control. From 1984, as C.E.O., he managed the return to profitability of Iveco SA, the manufacturer of commercial vehicles and heavy trucks, and developed it with the acquisition and incorporation of Ford Truck and Seddon Atkinson in the UK, Pegaso in Spain, Ashok Leyland (the second largest producer of commercial vehicle in India, in conjunction with the Hinduja group) and Astra in Italy. The technology transfer and the joint venture for the production of diesel engines and the Iveco Daily light commercial vehicle that he signed in 1985 with the Nanjing Automobile Corporation was one of the first initiatives to be started under the new course of China towards a market economy inaugurated by Deng Xiaoping in the early ‘80s. The same year he signed a consortium with Oto Melara for the development of C1 Ariete battle tank and the B1 Centauro wheeled tank destroyer. He personally guided the program to re-design the full product range of Iveco products: vehicles from 3 tonne weight up to the 56 tonne maxi- code vehicle, and engines from 56 to 1250 HP. The R&D; effort and the rationalisation of 22 plants in 5 countries of Europe was a major task that took five years to complete and cost more than 5 trillion Italian lire. Given the full range of product offer, Iveco became one of the two leaders of the European market, with 22% of market share in 1990. In 1989, Garuzzo negotiated the acquisition of Ford New Holland, which had resulted from an earlier merging of Ford Tractor and New Holland Agriculture, a world leader in agricultural machinery. The integration with Fiat Geotech (which in turn included Fiat Trattori, Laverda and Hesston), led to the creation of a world leader under the simplified logo New Holland (later to become CNH). In 1991, a year of deep crisis for the car sector Fiat Automobile, he was nominated chief operating officer (C.O.O. or “Direttore Generale”) of the Fiat group and chairman of Fiat Auto SpA, IVECO N.V. and New Holland N.V. He was one of the founding members of ACEA, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, which he chaired in 1994 and 1995. In 1993, he was questioned by prosecutor Antonio Di Pietro in connection with the investigation called “Tangentopoli” or “Mani Pulite” with allegations of some bribery for the sale of buses by an Iveco dealer to the Milan communality,\\"Top Fiat executive faces corruption probe\\", Financial Times, April 7, 1993. but he suffered no adverse judiciary consequences.

Current activity  After working ten years in the private equity industry, in 2007 Garuzzo co-founded Mid Industry Capital, a holding company listed at the Milan Stock Exchange with a paid-in capital of €100 million, which he has chaired since the beginning. The Company’s aim is the acquisition of small or medium enterprises and their development in the medium-long term, by contributing funds, management and expertise, with a strong entrepreneurial attitude.  The IGAV foundation  The “Istituto Garuzzo per le Arti Visive” (IGAV)http://www.igav-art.org non-profit organisation has been particularly active in art relations between Italy and China.

It runs from Tübingen to Sigmaringen. It is consistently single track and non-electrified, but it is equipped for the operation of tilting trains. Deutsche Bahn calls the Zollernalb line the Zollern-Alb-Bahn 1 (ZAB 1) to distinguish it from the Zollern-Alb-Bahn 2, the trunk line of the Hohenzollerische Landesbahn.  Route  Regionalbahn train below Hohenzollern Castle near Hechingen Separation of the Tuttlingen–Inzigkofen railway and the Tübingen–Sigmaringen railway west of Inzigkofen The line starts at 320 metres above sea level, when it leaves Tübingen Central Station to the west, with some services from Stuttgart running on from the Neckar-Alb Railway, and immediately swings to the south along the valley of Steinlach, which it follows to Bodelshausen. In Hechingen, the station is located north of the city and above the station of the Hohenzollerische Landesbahn; there is a track connecting the lines. After leaving Hechingen station, the Zollernalb Railway runs around the town to the south and continues to run to the southwest to Balingen, where it reaches a height of 517 m. South of Balingen the line runs to the southeast, up the valley of the Eyach and overcomes a long climb of 1 in 45, reaching the highest point of the line of about 730 metres before Albstadt-Ebingen. On the climb is the largest bridge on the line, the 77.35 metre-long viaduct in Albstadt-Lautlingen. The line continues down the Schmeie river, which it frequently crosses and, after passing through two tunnels, eventually reaches the valley of the Danube at Inzigkofen, where it joins the Tuttlingen–Inzigkofen railway. Immediately after crossing the river, the line reaches Sigmaringen station at 574 m above sea level. History The Zollernalb line, running from Tübingen to Sigmaringen via Hechingen, also known as the Hohenzollern Railway (Hohenzollernbahn), was built during the fourth period of construction of the Royal Württemberg State Railways (Königlich Württembergischen Staats-Eisenbahnen) from 1867 to 1878. A treaty signed on 3 March 1865 dealt with the issues between Württemberg and Prussia, because the line crossed Prussia’s Hohenzollern Province (Hohenzollernsche Lande). The first section between Tübingen and Hechingen was opened to traffic on 29 June 1869. The inauguration of the line between Hechingen and Balingen was delayed to 1 August 1874 by the Franco-Prussian War. The remaining section to Sigmaringen was opened on 1 July 1878. The construction period of approximately nine years can be explained by the fact that many engineering structures had to be built and the line suffered from difficult ground conditions, requiring a total of 32 bridges. The steep section between Balingen and Ebingen was built largely on an embankment in order to avoid landslides as a result of poor soil conditions on the escarpment. The total length of the Tübingen–Sigmaringen line was 87.505 km, of which 40.409 km lay in Hohenzollern, then Prussian territory. The construction costs amounted to 23,316,753.12 marks. Under the treaty, the maintenance of the entire line was the sole responsibility of the Royal Württemberg Railway. In 1922, the Zollernalb Railway between Tübingen and Sigmaringen had a total of 22 stations served by passenger trains, including a station called Zollern for the royal visitors to the Hohenzollern Castle. Over the next several decades the less frequented stations were closed. During 1997, modern diesel multiple units with strong acceleration were introduced on the line and Engstlatt station was reopened and a new station called Albstadt- Ebingen West was opened. In the early 1980s, the old Albstadt-Laufen station, which was some distance from the town was replaced by a station in the town. The former station is now an operating station used as a crossing loop on the single track line; an additional crossing loop was built as part of Albstadt- Ebingen West station. The upgrading of the Zollernalb Railway for the operation of tilting trains, which was completed in 2001, included the construction of new platforms and underpasses at the stations of Dußlingen, Mössingen, Bisingen and Albstadt-Ebingen. Operations  038 791 in Tübingen near the exit to Sigmaringen in May 1970 =Deutsche Bundesbahn period= Until early 1971, Deutsche Bundesbahn passenger services were mainly operated by P 8 steam locomotives based in Tübingen, partly in double traction because of the grades, hauling three and four axle Umbau-Wagens or Silberling carriages, class 64 locomotives were also used. Freight traffic was dominated by class 50 locomotives, which also hauled a few passenger services until 1975. With the end of steam locomotives on the Zollernalb Railway, operations were taken over by class 215 and class 211/212 diesel locomotives and Uerdingen railbuses; locomotive-hauled passenger trains included Silberling carriages or four-axle Umbau-Wagens, which now operated under the brand name of Allgäu-Zollernbahn. In 1988, the majority of passenger services were changed to operate with class 628.2 diesel multiple units, which were then new. Uerdingen railbus and class 627.0 diesel multiple units were used on individual scheduled services until 1997. Class 215 diesel locomotives were used only for a few passenger services and were becoming less and less used for freight transport. The last scheduled locomotive-hauled service on the line between Tübingen and Sigmaringen operated on 31 May 1997. In subsequent years, however, locomotive-hauled trains were repeatedly used for extended periods as a replacement for tilting trains that could not be operated. Current operations  =Passengers = RegioShuttle of the HzL in Tübingen In the summer of 1997, Hohenzollerischen Landesbahn (HzL) took over the operation of all Regionalbahn (RB) services on the Zollernalb Railway, using Regio Shuttle RS1 diesel railcars. Express services remain the responsibility of Deutsche Bahn and its subsidiary DB ZugBus Regionalverkehr Alb-Bodensee, which uses class 611 tilting trains, operating as Interregio-Express (IRE) services. Currently three services operate on the Zollernalb Railway at two- hourly intervals during the daytime: *IRE Stuttgart–Tübingen–Hechingen–Balingen–Albstadt-Ebingen *RB Tübingen–Hechingen–Balingen–Albstadt-Ebingen–Sigmaringen–Bad Saulgau–Aulendorf *RB Tübingen–Hechingen–Balingen–Albstadt–Ebingen (Mondays to Fridays only) The Interregio-Express trains between Tübingen and Albstadt-Ebingen stop only in Mössingen, Hechingen and Balingen. The Regionalbahn services stop at all stations, but some only if required. Between Tübingen and Albstadt-Ebingen the Regionalbahn services overlap and between Albstadt–Ebingen and Aulendorf Regionalbahn and Interregio-Express services also overlap, giving an approximate hourly service, so that from Monday to Friday all places except Strassberg-Winterlingen and Storzingen are served at least hourly. Extra trains run especially in the peak hours, for school traffic and on Sunday evening, some of which operate on only part of the line. In the early morning and late evening there are also deviations from the basic operating pattern. =Freight = Freight traffic was operated up to 31 December 2001 by the former Deutsche Bahn subsidiary, DB Cargo, hauled by class 294 and 365 locomotives. Under the MORA C concept all freight operations on the line would have been abandoned in 2001, but this was averted as the result of an agreement between DB Cargo and the Hohenzollerischen Landesbahn (HzL). On 2 January 2002, HzL took over wagonload traffic on the Zollernalb line and other lines in the region. Planning  For several years, there have been proposals to integrate the Tübingen–Albstadt-Ebingen section of the line (in association with the reactivation of the Talgang Railway—Talgangbahn—to Onstmettingen) in the proposed Regionalstadtbahn Neckar-Alb on the Karlsruhe model.

The film features British architect Norman Foster, who called the car \\"an incredibly beautiful aesthetic object\\" and rebuilt the fourth Dymaxion car from drawings and study of the first three cars. In the film, noted automobile collector Jay Leno calls Buckminster Fuller a genius. Buckminster Fuller's advocacy for humanity permeates the film. Director Noel Murphy said describing \\"Buckminster Fuller as a car designer would be like describing Jimi Hendrix as a guitar tech\\". Fuller was a visionary environmentalist; his lightweight teardrop-shaped car spun on three wheels, held a dozen people and was originally meant to run on alcohol fuel. The documentary explores his other green innovations, including his geodesic domes and philosophical approach to architecture. Story Exploring Fuller's invention of the Geodesic Dome and its innovative structural system, the documentary also examines Fuller's early heavy drinking, expulsion from Harvard University and suicide attempt. In 1927, after Fuller had lost his 4-year daughter due to Polio and had lost his job, he contemplated drowning himself in the freezing waters of Lake Michigan. Fuller reported an \\"intense mystical experience\\" realizing he belonged to the universe and could not take his own life. Production Filming took place over two years and tells the story of Buckminster Fuller. The director Noel Murphy traveled to England, Spain and all over the United States, researching, filming and interviewing Jay Leno and Norman Foster. Fuller designed and built three car prototypes shaped like zeppelin and called them Dymaxion, short for Dynamic Maximum Tension. The filmmaker, Noel Murphy, a descendant of a General Motors founder, has spent about $100,000 so far, traveling to Fuller archives and New England factory sites and interviewing those interested in Fuller. Murphy has acquired Fuller artifacts during his research, including a 1941 photo of a Dymaxion prototype taken just before an unsealed gas cap caused it to catch fire and be destroyed. One Dymaxion prototype survives, and was recently returned to the collection of the National Automobile Museum in Reno, Nevada. Murphy personally took part in the restoration at Crosthwaite & Gardiner, car restorers in East Sussex, England.

It was intended to develop extensive coal measures in the area, but in fact they proved to be uneconomic. The line was completed by the North British Railway and it opened in 1898. It was loss- making from the outset, and only a minimal agricultural traffic and some sporadic minor coal working provided traffic for it, although there was a brief workmen's passenger service to Largoward Colliery in 1911 - 1913. The line closed in 1964. After line closure, John Cameron purchased a main line steam engine and operated it on a short length of track at Lochty; this developed into the Lochty Private Railway and from 1967 to 1992 the short railway, and a steam museum at Lochty, operated successfully. There is now no railway activity on the former route. History =The East Fife Coalfield= The first railways in East Fife were built primarily to open up fishing harbours and agricultural districts. The Edinburgh and Northern Railway opened its north-south main line in 1850, having already changed its name to the Edinburgh, Perth and Dundee Railway. It came no closer to East Fife than Dysart and Markinch. The Leven Railway opened a branch from the EP&DR; at Thornton to Leven in 1854; but that railway did not immediately approach the harbour at Leven. The East of Fife Railway was built as an extension of the Leven Railway, opening from Leven to Kilconquhar in 1857, and the two companies combined and constructed onwards to Anstruther, so forming the line known as the Fife Coast Railway. The combined company was called the Leven and East of Fife Railway, and in due course both it and the EP&DR; were absorbed by the North British Railway, which became dominant in the area. For many years coal had been extracted on a small scale from areas near the coast between Dysart and Leven, but transport was always a limiting factor for the mineral. From about 1860 there were definite moves to build railway connections, but the North British Railway had a monopoly of railway transport and did little to develop the colliery connections. However very considerable mineral deposits were discovered under the extensive estate of the Wemyss Family, and coalmaster tenants of the Wemyss Estate, and in due course Randolph Gordon Erskine Wemyss promoted railways independently to serve the pits. The first of these was the Wemyss and Buckhaven Railway, opened in 1881 from Thornton to Buckhaven, later extended by the Leven Extension Railway to connect Methil and Leven harbours, in 1884. Randolph Wemyss sold the Wemyss and Buckhaven Railway to the NBR, but the development of further pits not served by the existing railways prompted him to construct a network of mineral lines that became known as the Wemyss Estate Railway, or alternatively Wemyss Private Railway. =Collieries inland= System map of the East Fife Central RailwayThe area of land inland from the coast at Methil and Leven, known as the Riggin o Fife, had also been the scene of coal extraction in the past, but its remoteness from the harbours and the poor roads made the work unprofitable. Nonetheless the wealth of the East Fife coalfield encouraged prospecting, and reports were obtained assuring a good seam of coal at Lochty, about five miles north west of Anstruther: a 40-inch seam of good quality coal at 10 fathoms. A railway was essential to the exploitation of the mineral, and a meeting was held in Edinburgh on 19 October 1892 to propose it. As well as the coal, the agriculture of the district would benefit from a railway, and those present were positive towards paying for further surveys. The railway would connect with the Leven and East of Fife line (now in NBR ownership) forming a triangle of lines there, then running north east and forking to join the NBR main line north of Cupar, and through Lochty to join the Anstruther to St Andrews line near Stravithie. Further rich coal seams aggregating to 60 feet were said to be under the line of route. The Parliamentary Bill for the line, to be known as the East Fife Central Railway, was deposited in January 1893; it proposed share capital of £250,000. =The Parliamentary process= Local people were broadly in favour if the proposed railway, but objections in Parliament came from two existing railways. The North British Railway objected on the ground, they claimed, that the district was already well served by them, and that the line would abstract from their business. The rival Caledonian Railway objected on the basis that the NBR was already a monopoly carrier in the district, and that they, the Caledonian, ought to have running powers on the line. George Bradley Wieland was the Chairman of the East Fife Central; he was a director of the North British Railway, and he had been Secretary of that company, but had resigned that office due to ill health. Wieland acquired the Letham Estate, close to the proposed line, on 14 March 1892, believing there to be extensive workable coal reserves there, and he naturally would welcome a railway connection. As a director of the NBR he was able to intercede, and the NBR objection was lifted: the NBR would work the line for 50% of gross receipts, but a formula guaranteed 4.5% of paid up East Fife Central shares.This arrangement was never activated because the company never managed to raise the capital to build the line itself. The Caledonian Railway was granted running powers over the line, and the East Fife Central itself acquired running powers into St Andrews over the Anstruther and St Andrews Railway. The East Fife Central Railway act of authorisation was given the Royal Assent on 24 August 1893. G B Wieland was confirmed as Chairman of the Company. =Realistic plans= During the progress of the Bill in Parliament, the directors considered how they would raise the necessary money. The earlier certainty about mineral wealth had abated, and the thin population of the agricultural district now looked less lucrative. Raising the money in the ordinary way now appeared to be impossible, and at length Wieland prevailed on the North British to fund the construction; they agreed subject to guarantees from the East Fife Central board members, giving the NBR a 3% return on the capital expenditure of £104,820. The through routes to Cupar and St Andrews were now abandoned, as was the triangular junction at Leven, and the line was cut back to Lochty, 14 miles in extent. Even that destination began to look doubtful, for it was reported in May 1895 that the trial borings there for coal had been disappointing. The junction near Cameron Bridge would be aligned to give direct running from Lochty to Leven and Methil harbours. At the first formal meeting of the newly authorised Company on 14 February 1894, four Directors executed formal guarantees, and others apparently did so later. The modification of the route required a new Act of Parliament; this was prepared by the NBR, also authorising passenger operation, and transfer of the line to themselves one year after the passage of the Bill. That Bill received the Royal Assent on 16 July 1895. =Construction and opening= There was further prevarication over the guarantees, but eventually the North British Railway appears to have accepted the situation, and construction started in August 1895. The NBR absorbed the East Fife Central on 6 July 1896. The construction progressed well enough, and on 29 July 1898 the line was substantially complete; seven gentlemen from Kennoway were permitted to take a private trip on the line using the contractor's engine and wagons. The contractor handed over the completed line to the North British Railway on 4 August 1898, and the line opened for goods and mineral traffic on Sunday 21 August 1898.Thomas & Turnock, and Awdry, give 18 August 1898, but Hajducki provides considerable supplementary detail for 21 August and seems to be authoritative. The goods stations on the line were Kennoway, Montrave, Largoward and Lochty. It was the longest goods-only line in the country. Initial business was exceedingly disappointing, and the intended mineral traffic was close to negligible; the trial borings at Lochty had disclosed no workable coal. By June 1900 consideration was being given to reducing the daily train to three days a week. The capital expenditure on the line had been £132,463 and this now looked like wasted money. For the year to 31 August 1899 receipts amounted to £1,124, but the 3% interest payable to the NBR was £3,973. The guarantors of the shortfall now began to consider their position. It appears that the NBR eventually released them from the full liability that they had undertaken. =Later operation= Although some colliery work was undertaken along the line, the collieries were mostly of short duration and limited output. In the summer of 1910 Territorial Army camps were established near Largoward, and special arrangements were made to convey the 6th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders to Largoward by rail, accompanied by their horse and equipment, and water in tanks. The traffic may have lasted for four weeks. When the Largobeath Colliery started exploratory work in 1911, there was insufficient accommodation locally for the miners, and a workmen's passenger service was set up from Cameron Bridge, with stations at Kennoway, Montrave, Largoward and Largobeath Colliery. There was one train each way daily; it reversed at East Fife Central Junction. However, by November 1913 the trains were discontinued; serious water inundation problems were experienced in the Largobeath workings, and in fact the colliery closed permanently soon afterwards.From Hajducki; Ross says the passenger trains ran in 1913 - 1914, citing periodicals of the North British Railway Study Group. Quick says \\"First shown in working timetable February 1913 (probably soon after start of service) and March 1914\\". Thomas & Turnock give closure to passengers as 7 July 1930, but this must be an error. There was some reduction in the (already limited) train service during World War I. In 1923 the main line railways of Great Britain were \\"grouped\\" following the Railways Act 1921, and the North British Railway was a constituent of the new London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). After the war, a large number of road motor lorries became available, and a road goods service began to develop, to the detriment of the meagre income of the line. The LNER reduced the train service to three trains a week. Goods traffic continued to decline. British Railways took over the railways on nationalisation in 1948. With an almost non-existent goods business, the line could hardly carry on and on 8 August 1964 the last service train ran on the line. =The Lochty Private Railway= The observation coach at the Lochty Private Railway In August 1966, John B Cameron purchased Lochty Farm, which included part of the course of the railway. He also acquired the LNER Class A4 locomotive 60009, Union of South Africa. He had the locomotive transported by road to Lochty in April 1967, and bought some track from the National Coal Board, enabling him to lay about three-quarters of a mile of line near Lochty. Footplate rides were given on the engine in the summer of 1967, and the following year a coach had been acquired, enabling trips in a short train, operating as the Lochty Private Railway. In 1970 the line was extended slightly and a further coach acquired for runs on the line. From 1973 the locomotive was returned to the main line network and Lochty was converted to a steam museum; some smaller locomotives were acquired, starting with an 0-6-0 from the Wemyss Estate Railway, no 16. Regular Sunday trips on the line were made in the summer, and the location was popular with holidaymakers and others; the operation was entirely staffed by volunteers. At the end of the 1992 season it was decided that rising costs of operation made continuing impossible, and the museum at Lochty closed. That same year, The Kingdom of Fife Railway Preservation Society was formed to take over the remaining collection at the railway and in 1994, the last of the collection was moved from Lochty by the society. Today, the rolling stock is now based at Kirkland yard in Leven, Fife. Topography The gradients on the line were steep; from East Fife Central Junction the line climbed at a ruling gradient of 1 in 70 almost as far as the 7 mile post, then alternating between moderate gradients and new sections of 1 in 70 as far as the Largobeath Colliery connection. From there the line fell at the same ruling gradient as far as the terminus at Lochty. The line climbed from 65 feet above sea level to 545 feet. The line was worked on the one engine in steam principle, and the speed limit throughout the line was 15 mph.

Fitocracy launched in February 2011, using an invite system to control new user signups. Invite codes were initially distributed through sites such as Reddit. In November 2011, the site introduced advertising, along with a paid option, known as Fitocracy Hero, which was advertisement-free and offered additional features. By then, Fitocracy claimed to have 120,000 users and a waiting list of a further 120,000. In January 2012, Fitocracy began a partnership with Red Bull in which the site would be used to host the Red Bull Fitness Challenge. By the end of January 2012, Fitocracy claimed a user base of 230,000 registered members. In March 2012, Fitocracy launched an app for iOS devices. In January 2013, Fitocracy launched an app for Android. In March 2013, Fitocracy reached one million users and also announced a collaboration with Arnold Schwarzenegger, which challenges users to exercise for 15 minutes per day. In August 2014, Fitocracy was listed as one of TIME's Best Websites of 2014. Fitocracy was acquired in 2016 by an unnamed buyer. Fitocracy is no longer available in the German Google App Store.

In 1990–1991 it became the University of Indianapolis Athens (UIA) through an agreement of the University of Indianapolis and International College with Dr. Peter Myrian as its President. Under this educational co-operation both institutions flourished with UIA reaching an enrollment of approximately 500 students at the retirement of Peter Myrian (1989–2004). UIA was acquired by UIndy in 2004 through a holding company, UIndy International, LLC, and changed its name to University of Indianapolis – Athens Campus (UINDY ATHENS). Vasilis J. Botopoulos, a University of Indianapolis Vice President, was named the first Chancellor of the Athens Campus. Under his leadership, the campus exceeded 700 students. The campus was located in the shadow of the Acropolis, in the historic Plaka neighbourhood of central Athens. In April 2013, UIndy announced that, because of declining enrolment and revenue related to economic problems in Greece, all undergraduate programs and most graduate programs would be phased out as of August 31, 2013. The college ceased operations in July 2014.

Cordella was one of five Hull-based trawlers that were taken up from trade by the Royal Navy in 1982 for service as naval trawlers (auxiliary MCM vessels) during the Falklands War. The trawlers were fitted with Oropesa towed minesweeping equipment and Extra Deep Armed Team Sweep (EDATS) equipment at HMNB Rosyth and crewed by Royal Navy personnel prior to operational deployment.Freedman, Lawrence (2005), The Official History of the Falklands Campaign: War and Diplomacy During night of 10 June 1982, Cordella supported her sister ship HMS Pict while the latter influence swept Berkeley Sound. No mines were found thus reducing the risk to ships engaging in naval bombardment of Argentine positions. During nights of 12, 13, and 14 June, she conducted covert operations resupplying SAS and SBS patrols deployed variously along the coast. Following the Argentine surrender Cordella and the other four ships of the 11 MCM cleared the minefields off Port Stanley. Post-war After the war she returned to the United Kingdom and returned to her peacetime role as a fishing vessel. In 2000 Cordella was sold to a Latvian owner as F/V Olga.

In a career that lasted from June 1829 to August 1831 he ran five times and won once. His only win came on his racecourse debut, when he recorded an upset victory in the 1829 Derby ridden by his sixty-year-old trainer John Forth. Frederick failed to reproduce his Derby-winning form, finishing no better than third in four subsequent races. Background Frederick was a bay horse bred by his owner, William Gratwicke of Ham Manor, near Angmering in Sussex. He was the one of several good horses produced by Gratwicke's unnamed Phantom mare, including The Margravine who in turn produced the 1845 Derby winner The Merry Monarch. The Phantom mare (sometimes referred to as Frederica) had been Gratwicke's first thoroughbred- he had bought her as a hunter- and Frederick was the second horse he bred from her. Frederick's sire Little John had little success as a stallion of racehorses being primarily known as a sire of hunters. He was owned by Gratwicke's neighbour Lord Egremont. Frederick was sent into training with the Yorkshire- born John Forth in Sussex, either at Mitchell Grove or at a Goodwood training stable owned by the Duke of Richmond. Racing career =1829: three-year- old season= Frederick made his racecourse debut on 4 June 1829 in the Epsom Derby in which he started at odds of 40/1 in a field of seventeen runners with the 2000 Guineas winner Patron starting 6/5 favourite. According to the Sporting Review, the huge crowd included all ranks of society, from the Queen of Portugal to the \\"bare-footed tramp.\\" Forth, who was at least sixty years old at the time, elected to ride the horse himself, while the stable's other runner The Exquisite, which was owned by Forth, was ridden by Frank Buckle Jr. Although The Exquisite was widely regarded as the stable's best horse and was better fancied in the betting, Forth had asked his bookmaker to shift all his bets onto Frederick on the day before the race. His bookmaker, William Crockford agreed, observing that Forth could \\"ride both of them for what he cared\\", as neither had \\"a ghost of a chance\\". The ground on Derby day was unusually fast, with one source describing it as being \\"as hard as Regent- street on a Summer's day\\". In the race the favourite, Patron, was soon struggling and a horse named Lazarus led the field in the straight. The two Forth runners both appeared to be moving strongly and moved past Lazarus a furlong from the finish, with the race apparently between them. The Exquisite took the lead and looked the likely winner, but Forth produced Frederick with a \\"Chifney rush\\" in the last strides to win by a head. Forth became the oldest jockey to win a Derby and was credited with having ridden a fine tactical race. Frederick's only other race that year was in the St Leger at Doncaster on 15 September. Before the race, Gratwicke stayed at Weatherby Grange as the guest of Christopher Wilson (\\"Old Kit\\"), whose horse, Champion, had been the last Derby winner to take the St Leger. Wilson promised to remove the painting of Champion from above his fireplace and replace it with one of Frederick if Gratwicke's colt won. Frederick started 4/1 second favourite for the race with Rowton, a colt who had not run at Epsom, being made the 7/2 favourite. Rowton led almost from the start and won easily, with Frederick finishing sixth, having never appeared as a serious challenger. The St Leger would be Frederick's last race for nineteen months. =1831: five-year-old season= Frederick finally returned to the racecourse in a handicap race at the Newmarket First Spring meeting in April 1831. He carried 123 pounds and finished unplaced behind Fortitude. It was then revealed that the racecourse starter had called a false start and that the race was to be re-run immediately. Frederick finished unplaced again, although on this occasion the winner was Augustus. On Frederick's next appearance at Brighton on July 28 he carried top weight of 124 pounds in the Gold Cup and started the 2-1 second favourite. He finished third of the four runners behind Mahmoud. Three weeks later, Frederick ran in the Duke of Richmond's Plate at Goodwood. Carrying 126 pounds he finished unplaced behind the three-year-old Ciudad Rodrigo. Stud career Frederick was retired to his owner's stud at Ham. He was in little demand as a sire, as is clear from the fact that he was advertised as covering thoroughbred mares free of charge, with a 3½ guinea fee for half-bred mares. He sired no racehorses of any consequence. Frederick died in 1837, breaking his leg when \\"lunging\\" after being startled by a runaway butcher's horse, and was buried under a chestnut tree on Gratwicke's estate. His gravestone (with the words \\"Frederic 1837\\") survives close to the 18th green of the Ham Manor Golf Club. Pedigree *Frederick's pedigree contains a degree of inbreeding. His paternal grandam Grey Skim and his maternal great-grandam Chestnut Skim were sisters, both being daughters of Woodpecker and Milsinstown's Herod mare.

This company manufactured pneumatic hammers for tunnelling. By 1896 it transformed into Moteurs S.A. to build high speed steam engines. By the early 20th century, when Mr. Zenobe Gramme invented the electrical Dynamo, the steam engines were obsolete, and AF were manufacturing reciprocating compressors for the coal Industry. Nearly 30 years later the company was reformed as Moteurs & François Réunis s.a. and over the next two decades this company continued to develop its heavy duty compressors especially for the Steel industry with powers up to 1000 HP. After 1960, when Ateliers François s.a. was formed, a range of oil free reciprocating compressors with PTFE piston rings were developed and these successfully operated when high quality air was needed in the brewing, chemical, petro-chemical, pharmaceutical and food industries. In the reciprocating piston oil free compressor technology, the L design is typical to AF. The early 1980s saw the first entry, into the world of bottling liquids, of PET material. To form bottles, which are blown into a mould, required much higher than normal pressure of air and AF Compressors were to realise that this was en emerging market of importance and designed a range of 40 bar oil free PET compressors to meet this need. Since then it is now common to see, mineral water, carbonated soft drinks, fruits juices, edible oil, beers, vinegar, wines, dipping and sauces, liquid soaps, medicines, cosmetics and perfumes all in PET bottles and AF's production is almost totally now in High pressure oil free compressors for this application. Since 1990s AF has developed subsidiaries and technical support in the whole Europe, in Russia, in China, the Middle-East, Africa, Latin America, Northern America, Africa, in the Far East and also in the South East Asia and Pacific.

Ljubljana: Mladinska knjiga, p. 296. was a Slovene Partisan.  Life  Premrl was born on 29 February 1920 in Podnanos, at that time in Italy (now in Slovenia). He was the firstborn child in an ethnically conscious Slovene family. His uncle Stanko Premrl was a Roman Catholic priest, and well- known composer and organist, author of the melody for the Slovenian National Anthem. Another of his uncles was a major in the armed forces of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Premrl attended a secondary business school in Gorizia, where he gathered like-minded individuals around himself. Matters often came to blows between the ethnic Slovenes and the local Fascists, and eventually his father withdrew him from school because of this. He continued learning on his own after he no longer attended school. He participated in the anti-Fascist movement. Through contacts in Ljubljana he was able to acquire and distribute Slovene books. He advocated a policy of resistance against the Italian authorities and, among other things, prepared an unsuccessful assassination attempt against the Italian teacher and Fascist party secretary in Podnanos.Mira Cenčič. 1997. Tigr: Slovenci pod Italijo in TIGR na okopih v boju za narodni obstoj. Kras in Vipavska dolina. Ljubljana: Mladinska knjiga, p. 205. Premrl served in the Italian army from 1940 to 1941. In January 1942 the noncommissioned officer and leader of a Slovene circle, Ivan Kosovel (1912–1943), obtained sick leave papers for Premrl, whereupon he deserted the Italian Army. Because the Italians had burned his family's home and interned his family in a prison camp, Premrl joined the Partisans immediately and became a soldier in the Littoral Company () on 3 February 1942. He distinguished himself as the leader of a group of Partisans on 18 April that year in a battle on the Nanos Plateau and in eight other successful operations in the following three months. In May 1942 he was sentenced to death in absentia by the Fascist Special Tribunal for the Defense of the State in Rome.Gestrin, Ferdo. 1961. Pomniki naše revolucije. Ljubljana: Mladinska knjiga, p. 254. On 20 August the prefect of Gorizia, Aldo Cavani, issued a warrant for his arrest and placed a 50,000 lira bounty on his head.Ferenc, Tone. 1983.

Memorial for Janko Premrl Vojko near the Vojko Lodge on the Nanos Plateau When the Simon Gregorčič Brigade was established, Premrl was named its deputy commandant, and he became the commander of the Upper Vipava Company, and then the Trnovo Company. In the second half of September 1942 he and his company encamped at Črni Vrh, first near Gornje Griže and then at Brin Hill (). From this position the company was able to observe the Trnovo Forest Plateau (). Because the camp was well hidden, they remained there six months. On 13 February 1943 the Headquarters of the Littoral Operations Zone named Premrl commandant of the Andrej Laharnar 1st Littoral Partisan Brigade. Because of Premrl’s death soon after and the engagement of units recruiting volunteers in central Slovenia, this brigade was never actually formed. On 15 February 1943 a Fascist post was being repositioned from Brus at Idrijska Bela to Idrija. It was attacked by two Partisan squads under Premrl's command. The site where Premrl was mortally wounded The official version of Premrl's death claims that during the battle he ran towards the second squad in order to keep then from a hazard and was struck by a bullet from an Italian dugout. Because Premrl was seriously wounded, the company withdrew to a camp on Brin Hill in Idrijski Log. However, another version of his death claims that he was shot in the back by his fellow Partisans because his morals and religious faith were out of step with Communist principles. This version of Premrl’s death was also supported by his sister based on eyewitness accounts.Premrl, Radoslava. 1992. Moj brat Janko - Vojko. Ljubljana: Slovenska matica. Although a doctor was requested, Premrl only received instructions from Idrija for medical treatment, and so his condition worsened. Premrl died of his injuries on 22 February 1943. Premrl was named a people's hero of Yugoslavia at the second AVNOJ conference in the Bosnian town of Jajce, held from 21 to 29 November 1943.  Legacy  Vojko Street in the Bežigrad District of Ljubljana There are streets named after Premrl in the Slovenian towns of Ljubljana, Koper, Nova Gorica, Solkan, Vipava, Anhovo, Plave, and Portorož, as well as in Belgrade, Serbia. A lodge known as Vojko's Lodge on the Nanos Plateau () was built and named after Premrl in 1949. A bust of Premrl stands near the lodge. A memorial known as Vojko's Plaque (), marking the spot where Premrl was mortally wounded, is a landmark along the Idrijca River about 2 km south of Idrija. The Cave at Vojko’s Plaque () is in turn named after this landmark.Cave at Vojko’s Plaque on Geopedia Until 1 September 2006, Janko \\"Vojko\\" Premrl Primary School of Koper () was named for Premrl.

Its relationships have been interpreted differently over the past century. It has been placed in the family Elachistidae, the family Oecophoridae, and the subfamily Coelopoetinae within the Elachistidae. Taxonomy It was described from California in 1907 as a monotypic genus by Thomas de Grey, 6th Baron Walsingham to house the new species C. glutinosi, which is therefore the type species. Lord Walsingham placed the genus in the family Hyponomeutidae. A second species from California was added in 1920 by William Barnes and August Busck, C. baldella, based on supposed colour differences with the type species, and the genus was moved to the family Elachistidae by these two authors in the same paper. This new taxon was then synonymised with C. glutinosi by Annette F. Braun in 1948 due to the insects being morphologically identical and found on the same food plants, rendering the genus monotypic again. This interpretation of synonymy was upheld by Ronald W. Hodges in 1983, Lauri Kaila in 1995, and van Nieukerken et al. in 2011. Braun also placed the genus in the family Elachistidae in her 1948 monograph on the North American members of the family, based on the morphology of the mouth parts, the antenna and the wing venation, although she mentions the divergent genitalia compared to the rest of the family. Hodges was the first to classified the one species in its own subfamily, the Coelopoetinae of the Elachistidae, in 1978, although he mentions doubting if the new subgenus might not better be placed in the Oecophorini. and in the 1983 Check List of the Lepidoptera of America North of Mexico (in which it is numbered 1076) he retained this classification. In 1995 Kaila reviewed the genus Coelopoeta and continued to include it in the family Elachistidae. He described two new species, one from high elevations in California and another from the Yukon in Canada. Brown et al. classified the genus in the subfamily Oecophorinae of the Oecophoridae in 2004. In Zhi-Qiang Zhang's 2011 attempt to number all the known animal species of earth, van Nieukerken et al., the authors of the section on Lepidoptera, recognised the Coelopoetidae as an independent, monotypic family within the superfamily Gelechioidea, comprising three species in the genus Coelopoeta. Three years later, in 2014, a cladistic analysis by Heikkilä et al. moved the genus to the subfamily Coelopoetinae of the family Pterolonchidae.

In 2011 it was recognised as an independent family in its own right, as the Coelopoetidae, by van Nieukerken et al., only for it to be moved into the subfamily Coelopoetinae of the family Pterolonchidae a few years later following a cladistics analysis by Heikkilä et al. in 2014. Description The length of the fore-wings is 5-6.5 mm. The ground colour of the fore-wings is creamy white or pale ocherous, densely dusted with scales of grey or brownish near the tips. The hind-wings are grey. Distribution This moth species has been recorded throughout California, from the far north to the far south. Ecology Eriodictyon californicum, a host plant of Coelopoeta glutinosi, growing in California. The caterpillars feed on Eriodictyon species, a genus of plants in the borage family, Boraginaceae, including E. californicum, E. crassifolium and E. trichocalyx. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine is gall-like. The mine is on the top side of the leaf; it extends from the midrib to either side, occupying the \\"width of the leaf\\". This so contorts the leaf that it curls over the mine at both the sides and at the end. The larva then sequesters its frass to the top of the gall-like structure, separating it from a large chamber below with a thin sheet of silk, both structures fitting within the upper and lower epidermis of the leaf. Within this lower chamber the caterpillar spins its cocoon. The cocoon has a prolonged tube at its anterior end which opens up into a semicircular slit the caterpillar has made in the leaf surface. Almost all the adult moths, the imagoes, have been caught flying in June and July, or reared and then emerged from their cocoons in June and July, although a few have been collected up until the first day of September.

The May 28 Brigade and their compound were then attacked by local fighters who then took control of the town. The incident, the combatants, and the motives of the two main belligerents — the May 28 Brigade and Brigade 93 — remain uncertain and contentious. The conflict was originally reported to be an attack by Gaddafi loyalists by local NTC officials. However, tribal leaders and residents have denied any affiliation with Gaddafi's remnants, stating their goal was the establishment of their own council in the city. Similarly Britain's Foreign Office has dismissed claims of this incident representing a pro-Gaddafi attack against the NTC, stating that this was a dispute between tribal leaders of the Warfalla tribe and the NTC. The Libyan government subsequently engaged in negotiations to re-establish normal relations with Bani Walid while maintaining a siege on the town, including a presidential visit to the town. Walid Ben Shaaban, a Libyan militia leader has stated \\"we will take revenge militarily but legitimately\\", referring to the security issues emanating from Bani Walid. In October, more troops were sent to Bani Walid, with an aim of re-establishing control of the city by military means. Intense shelling of the town started on 18 October.State-linked Libyan militias shell Bani Walid  Background  Bani Walid was one of the last cities to fall into the hands of the rebel army who overthrew Muammar Gaddafi. As a former Gaddafi loyalist stronghold, an insurgency against new rulers developed in the city. After months of tensions in the city, a group of anti-NTC fighters attacked the main NTC base in Bani Walid.  Uprising  = 23 January attack = After distributing pro-Gaddafi papers the previous day, a group of 100-150 soldiers carrying the green flag of the Gaddafi government attacked the main NTC base of the city, killing four NTC soldiers; wounding 20 others and trapping the others in their base, according to Mahmud Warfelli, the spokesman of the NTC's council for Bani Walid, who called for help and feared a massacre as the NTC compound was besieged from all sides by the pro-Gaddafi fighters. Witnesses told Reuters that the fighting had stopped and that pro-Gaddafi fighters were in control of the city, raising green flags and roaming in the center of the town. The attack happened after a militia loyal to the National Transitional Council arrested armed pro-Gaddafi fighters. In response to the attack, armored units of NTC fighters were deployed from Misrata, tasked with cutting off all routes out of the city. NTC forces were also preparing to conduct air sorties over the city, according to a Libyan Air Force official. Several NTC officials have offered conflicting reports in regards to the attack. Anes Elsharif, a former military council spokesman, said that pro-Gaddafi fighters had stormed the NTC base but they did not control the city. Libyan defence minister, Osama al-Juwaily, said that while fighting has taken place, he could not confirm that Gaddafi loyalists were involved in the clashes. However, Mohamed Bashir, mayor of Bani Walid, stated that Gaddafi loyalists have seized control of the city and that NTC fighters involved in the fighting were forced to retreat. He reported that at least 20 to 25 unidentified fighters were killed in the fighting. = 24 January = On 24 January, local elders denied reports that they were loyal to Gaddafi and Reuters reporters in Bani Walid saw no signs of the Gaddafi-era green flags which witnesses earlier said had been hoisted over the town. A meeting of 200 elders abolished the NTC council in the city after local fighters routed NTC militia out of the town. They said that they will appoint their own government without NTC interference, but denied that they were supporting the Gaddafi government. Conflicting reports continued to come on 24 January as Al Jazeera reporter Stefanie Dekker, based on the outskirts of the town, said that pro-Gaddafi fighters took over the city on 23 January and were still in control of the town, with soldiers from other towns massing themselves on Bani Walid outskirts. The local head of the NTC council Mubarak Al Fotmani, who has been involved in the clash the previous day, flew to Misrata where he repeated his version that hundreds of pro-Gaddafi took over the city. The local NTC military leader Abdullah al- Khazmi said that the May 28 brigade was the only link between Bani Walid and the new authorities. He added that the brigade only had a superficial control over the town in the previous month and estimated that 99% of Bani Walid were pro-Gaddafi. He also said that Gaddafi loyalists were branded under the Brigade 93 name and that they had been responsible for the deaths of 13 NTC fighters in December. The Associated Press also confirmed that NTC reinforcements from Benghazi were massing on the outskirts of Bani Walid. Libya interior minister said that they will strike back if Gaddafi loyalists were behind the Bani Walid events. The previous day, he dismissed the claims of a pro-Gaddafi attack and said it was a local problem. Local tribal leader Colonel Ouer stated that they were in contact with Mustafa Abdul Jalil and were meeting with representatives of the nearby towns of Zintan and Sabratha. Locals elders said that the events started when the May 28 Brigade arrested a Bani Walid resident and tortured him. They accused the May 28 Brigade of becoming an oppressor in the city. The elders also said that they were not Gaddafi loyalists and that they had only local motivation. A Reuters journalist touring the city saw no green flags, but a few new Libyan flags instead, even though some pro-Gaddafi graffiti was visible on the walls of the city. The NTC jets were heard over the city, and NTC soldiers took up positions 50 km away from Bani Walid but had not received orders to move on the city. = 25 January = Libya's Defence Minister Osama al-Juwaily arrived in Bani Walid to hold talks with the town's new council to find a solution while NTC soldiers set up checkpoints in the surrounding region. Later in the day Libya's defense Minister recognized the newly formed local tribal council, which overthrew the local NTC council, as the new authority of Bani Walid. = Cease-fire = On 26 January, the ousted militia continued to camp 30 km away from Bani Walid, and mixed together with fighters from other cities. They repeated that Bani Walid was under pro-Gaddafi control and estimated at 300 their numbers. They also claimed that dozens of pro-Gaddafi who were held at their base were freed in the uprising and threatened to launch an assault in the city if they are not allowed back in and if the former prisoners were not handed to them. Units of the national army stayed away from the militias and were manning a few checkpoints elsewhere in the desert. Residents asked by AFP said privately that they were nostalgic of Gaddafi era, one of them saying that Gaddafi was living in the heart of Bani Walid people. They also said that they were resigned to the change in the country and that the uprising was only local. A resident told that the person arrested by the May 28 Brigade, an event which started the uprising, may have been a former pro-Gaddafi fighter. The resentment toward former rebels seems widespread in Bani Walid, with accusation of theft, arbitrary arrests and other abuses issued by the local population. The new council of Bani Walid decided that May 28 brigade members could return to the city only individually and without weapons. On 27 January, a commander of the May 28 Brigade, Imbarak al-Futmani told Reuters that they would retake Bani Walid and that they were only waiting for the green light from the prime minister. The militia assembled with other militia and regrouped 800 fighters. He also claimed that insurgents, which ousted them from Bani Walid, are pro-Gaddafi and that they seized tanks when they took over the May 28 Brigade base. On 28 January, dozens of upset protesters gathered in front of the Prime minister offices to protest against the tour that the defense minister Juwaily made in Bani Walid earlier in the week. They accused him of siding with Gaddafi loyalists. An anti-Gaddafi doctor who had origins from Bani Walid said that the minister shook hands with well-known Gaddafi loyalists during his meetings in the city. As of 14 February, the tribal council was still directing the city. On 26 February, it was reported that Gaddafi loyalists were using Bani Walid as a safe haven and NTC chairman Jalil said that forces would be used if the city did not hand them. Al Jazeera reported that pro-Gaddafi elements were in control of the city. Some families that supported the Libyan rebellion fled the city for Tripoli alongside the official militia.http://www.aljazeera.com/video/africa/2012/02/201222818102884959.html German news outlet Qantara.de visited the city in April 2012 and reported that while many residents were resentful of the NTC due to the heavy damage anti- Gaddafi forces and looters among the militias inflicted during and immediately after the civil war, no Gaddafi-era green flags were visible in the city, while a handful of Libyan tricolours were in evidence. As of the time of publication on 27 April 2012, the NTC had still not formally recognised the Bani Walid Council of Elders' legitimacy as the local government despite the Council of Elders' edict handing over security in Bani Walid to the police and army. Many Libyans elsewhere in the country still view Bani Walid as a \\"Gaddafi city\\" owing to its late resistance during the war, according to the report. However, other reports from September 2012 stated that pictures of Gaddafi are being shown in public during weddings and youths play his speeches. Furthermore, school students refrain from singing the new national anthem, and teachers refused the revised curriculum. Fighting erupted outside Bani Walid on 12 May and 2 fighters from the Misrata Libyan Shield Brigade, stationed between Tarouna and Bani Walid, were killed by local fighters. Bani Walid fighters were also suspected of having arrested 4 members of the Zliten council and one member of the former NTC council of Bani Walid who fled to Tripoli.http://www.libyaherald.com/bani-walid-negotiator-hospitalised-after- clashes-with-ntc-guards/http://www.libyaherald.com/fighting-outside-bani- walid/ On 7 July, Bani Walid voted in the national poll, but government officials were denied access to the town and were unable to control the voting process.http://truth-out.org/news/item/10202-libyans-vote-in-first-election- in-more-than-40-yearshttp://www.twincities.com/ci_21024829/old-rivalries-are- endangering-libyas-dreams-fresh-start On 11 September, interim president Mohammed el-Megarif visited Bani Walid in an attempt to reintegrate the city to the rest of the country.  October siege  On 2 October, forces from Bani Walid engaged government forces in the Mordum area, resulting in one fatality. Following a buildup of several thousand government forces around Bani Walid, fighting renewed on 8 October in the Mordum area, some 30 km south of one of the front lines at Bir Dufan. The fighting resulted in several injuries but no fatalities. Of the injuries reported on 8 October, 26 were of patients admitted to Bani Walid hospital with a range of symptoms that led local doctors to accused the Libyan Army of using gas against Bani Walid. The Libyan military and political leadership have both denied the use of gas, and it has been suggested that the gas was released from storage buildings within Bani Walid after having been hit by Libyan Army shells, or also that it was caused by some form of corrosion. On 16 October, further fighting was reported from Bani Walid on three of the fronts surrounding the town, as opposed to previous fighting which was confined to the Mordum area. The brigades involved in the initial fighting were from Misrata, Mizda, and Gharyan. As with previous fighting however, the fighting had not been authorised by the Yousef Mangoush, the Armed Forces Chief of Staff. Despite lacking authorisation from Libya's political and military leadership, the fighting led to an escalating series of skirmishes between both sides, with 11 dead and 94 wounded being reported early on 18 October. This led to Libyan Army units being ordered to enforce GNC Resolution No.7, which calls for the arrest of those responsible for the death of Omran Shaban and suspected of ties to the former regime, launching a full-scale attack on the town on the night of 18 October. According to army spokesman Mohammed al-Gandus, some 2,000 government forces being involved in the offensive. The actual status of the town however has been in dispute, with the army claiming it was close to the center of Bani Walid and in control of the airport, whereas a local Bani Walid resident has insisted that Libyan Army units had failed to enter the city. National Congress leader Mohammed Magarief announced on 19 October that not all areas of Libya had been \\"fully liberated\\" on the eve of the first anniversary of the capture and death of deposed dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Speaking on national television, Magarief singles out Bani Walid, saying it had become \\"a safe haven for a large number of those who are outside of the law.\\" On 20 October, authorities in Tripoli announced the capture of Gaddafi's former spokesman Moussa Ibrahim near the town of Tarhouna, south of the capital. Ibrahim's whereabouts had been unknown since the end of the war in 2011 and there had been several earlier reports of his arrest.

When combined with basic optical spectrometers such as prisms or diffraction gratings and automated, ground-based observation platforms, it presents a cheap and powerful means for the measurement of trace gas species such as ozone and nitrogen dioxide. Typical setups allow for detection limits corresponding to optical depths of 0.0001 along lightpaths of up to typically 15 km and thus allow for the detection also of weak absorbers, such as water vapour, Nitrous acid, Formaldehyde, Tetraoxygen, Iodine oxide, Bromine oxide and Chlorine oxide. São Vicente, Cape Verde Theory DOAS instruments are often divided into two main groups: passive and active ones. The active DOAS system such as longpath(LP)-systems and cavity-enhanced(CE) DOAS systems have their own light-source, whereas passive ones use the sun as their light source, e.g. MAX(Multi-axial)-DOAS. Also the moon can be used for night-time DOAS measurements, but here usually direct light measurements need to be done instead of scattered light measurements as it is the case for passive DOAS systems such as the MAX-DOAS. The change in intensity of a beam of radiation as it travels through a medium that is not emitting is given by Beers law: : I=I_0 \\\\exp \\\\left (\\\\sum_i \\\\int \\\\rho_i \\\\beta_i \\\\, ds \\\\right ) where I is the intensity of the radiation, \\\\rho is the density of substance, \\\\beta is the absorption and scattering cross section and s is the path. The subscript i denotes different species, assuming that the medium is composed of multiple substances. Several simplifications can be made. The first is to pull the absorption cross section out of the integral by assuming that it does not change significantly with the path—i.e. that it is a constant. Since the DOAS method is used to measure total column density, and not density per se, the second is to take the integral as a single parameter which we call column density: : \\\\sigma=\\\\int \\\\rho \\\\, ds The new, considerably simplified equation now looks like this: : I=I_0 \\\\exp \\\\left (\\\\sum_i \\\\beta_i \\\\sigma_i \\\\right ) = I_0 \\\\prod_i e^{\\\\beta_i \\\\sigma_i} If that was all there was to it, given any spectrum with sufficient resolution and spectral features, all the species could be solved for by simple algebraic inversion. Active DOAS variants can use the spectrum of the lightsource itself as reference. Unfortunately for passive measurements, where we are measuring from the bottom of the atmosphere and not the top, there is no way to determine the initial intensity, I0. Rather, what is done is to take the ratio of two measurements with different paths through the atmosphere and so determine the difference in optical depth between the two columns (Alternative a solar atlas can be employed, but this introduces another important error source to the fitting process, the instrument function itself. If the reference spectrum itself is also recorded with the same setup, these effects will eventually cancel out): : \\\\delta = \\\\ln \\\\left (\\\\frac{I_1}{I_2}\\\\right ) = \\\\sum_i \\\\beta_i \\\\left (\\\\sigma_{i2} - \\\\sigma_{i1} \\\\right ) =\\\\sum_i \\\\beta_i \\\\, \\\\Delta \\\\sigma_i A significant component of a measured spectrum is often given by scattering and continuum components that have a smooth variation with respect to wavelength. Since these don't supply much information, the spectrum can be divided into two parts: : I=I_0 \\\\exp \\\\left [ \\\\sum_i \\\\left (\\\\beta_i^* + \\\\alpha_i \\\\right ) \\\\sigma_i \\\\right ] where \\\\alpha is the continuum component of the spectrum and \\\\beta^* is that which remains and we shall call the differential cross- section. Therefore: : \\\\delta_d + \\\\delta_c = \\\\ln \\\\left (\\\\frac{I_{1d}}{I_{2d}} \\\\right ) \\\\+ \\\\ln \\\\left (\\\\frac{I_{1c}}{I_{2c}} \\\\right ) =\\\\sum \\\\left (\\\\beta_i^* +\\\\alpha_i \\\\right ) \\\\left (\\\\sigma_{i2} - \\\\sigma_{i1} \\\\right ) = \\\\sum_i \\\\beta_i^* \\\\left (\\\\sigma_{i2} - \\\\sigma_{i1} \\\\right) +\\\\sum_i \\\\alpha_i \\\\left(\\\\sigma_{i2} - \\\\sigma_{i1} \\\\right) where we call \\\\delta_d the differential optical depth (DOD). Removing the continuum components and adding in the wavelength dependence produces a matrix equation with which to do the inversion: : \\\\delta_d (\\\\lambda) = \\\\sum_i \\\\beta_i^*(\\\\lambda) \\\\, \\\\Delta \\\\sigma_i What this means is that before performing the inversion, the continuum components from both the optical depth and from the species cross sections must be removed. This is the important “trick” of the DOAS method. In practice, this is done by simply fitting a polynomial to the spectrum and then subtracting it. Obviously, this will not produce an exact equality between the measured optical depths and those calculated with the differential cross- sections but the difference is usually small. Alternatively a common method which is applied to remove broad-band structures from the optical density are binomial high-pass filters. Also, unless the path difference between the two measurements can be strictly determined and has some physical meaning (such as the distance of telescope and retro-reflector for a longpath-DOAS system), the retrieved quantities, \\\\lbrace \\\\Delta \\\\sigma_i \\\\rbrace will be meaningless. The typical measurement geometry will be as follows: the instrument is always pointing straight up. Measurements are taken at two different times of day: once with the sun high in the sky, and once with it near the horizon. In both cases the light is scattered into the instrument before passing through the troposphere but takes different paths through the stratosphere as shown in the figure. To deal with this, we introduce a quantity called the airmass factor which gives the ratio between the vertical column density (the observation is performed looking straight up, with the sun at full zenith) and the slant column density (same observation angle, sun at some other angle): : \\\\sigma_{i0} = \\\\mathrm{amf}_i (\\\\theta) \\\\sigma_{i \\\\theta} where amfi is the airmass factor of species i, \\\\sigma_{i0} is the vertical column and \\\\sigma_{i\\\\theta} is the slant column with the sun at zenith angle \\\\theta. Airmass factors can be determined by radiative transfer calculations. Some algebra shows the vertical column density to be given by: : \\\\sigma_{i0} = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta \\\\sigma_i} {\\\\mathrm{amf}_i(\\\\theta_2) - \\\\mathrm{amf}_i(\\\\theta_1)} where \\\\theta_1 is the angle at the first measurement geometry and \\\\theta_2 is the angle at the second. Note that with this method, the column along the common path will be subtracted from our measurements and cannot be recovered. What this means is that, only the column density in the stratosphere can be retrieved and the lowest point of scatter between the two measurements must be determined to figure out where the column begins.

Built in the middle of the nineteenth century, it is located near Burgoon in Sandusky County. Although it is no longer used to facilitate transportation, the bridge has been preserved and is now a historic site. Construction In 1851, Amos Mull owned a sawmill along the east branch of Wolf Creek in Ballville Township but had a significant problem: the stream hindered potential customers. After he petitioned the Sandusky County Commissioners for aid, his efforts bore fruit: the commissioners agreed to grant $75 toward the construction of a covered bridge near Mull's streamside house, and he agreed to provide the lumber needed to build the bridge.Mull Covered Bridge, Ballville Township, 2010. Accessed 2012-01-23. The design selected was known as the Town Lattice truss; composed of many small diagonal elements, the bridge's framework appears to resemble a lattice because of the criss-crossing pattern in which the diagonal elements are attached. The structure itself is composed of the wood from Mull's sawmill, covered with wooden siding placed vertically to cover the sides;Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2.

Measuring in length, the bridge was built as a single-span structure; at an unknown later date, a concrete support was added in the middle, converting it into a two- span bridge.Moore, Elma Lee. Ohio's Covered Bridges. Charleston: Arcadia, 2010, 105. Historic site After more than a century of service, the Mull Covered Bridge closed on 2 August 1962 after a new concrete arch bridge was built to carry the local road that had formerly used the old bridge. Seeing the potential value of preserving the Mull Bridge, the Sandusky County Historical Society pressured the county commissioners to order its preservation; the request was successful, and the bridge was kept as a historic site. Twelve years later, the bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, because it was an example of historic methods of construction. At that time, it was one of just three covered bridges still standing in Ohio's northwestern quarter, and one of just eleven Town Lattice Trusses statewide. Since then, the bridge has not been forgotten: it was renovated in 1990, re-renovated in 2015,Carson, Daniel. \\"Covered Bridge Repairs Nearly Done\\", The News-Messenger, 2015-08-03. Accessed 2015-09-06. and today it is part of Sandusky County's park system. Now more than a century and a half old, it is one of Ohio's oldest extant covered bridges. No other covered bridges remain in Sandusky County, although six others — including a railroad bridge measuring nearly that spanned the Sandusky River — were built and have been destroyed.

The film's screenplay was co-written by Ðorđe Milosavljević and Nikola Pejaković with input from journalist Filip Švarm. It premiered on 13 March 2012. Plot Dušan Ilić (Gordan Kičić), employed at the Serbian state prosecutor's office, gets a top secret case to investigate a war crime committed during Yugoslav Wars by a disbanded paramilitary unit. He manages to find Mićun (Uliks Fehmiu) who's the only surviving witness.Ekskluzivno: Pogledajte trejler iz filma \\"Ustanička ulica\\";Blic, 20 January 2012 Cast * Gordan Kičić as Dušan Ilić * Uliks Fehmiu as Sredoje Govoruša a.k.a. Mićun Duvnjak * Rade Šerbedžija as Vraneš * Petar Božović as Grbavi Production The movie's producer is Gordan Kičić through his production company Kombajn Film. He reportedly turned to Ustanička ulica after trying, and ultimately failing, to secure financing for two previous projects — film adaptations of Marko Vidojković's Kandže and Biljana Srbljanović's Beogradska trilogija.Život u sat i četrdeset minuta;Vreme, 8 March 2012 The filming of Ustanička ulica started on 13 April 2011 and wrapped up on 4 June with 42 shooting days in total on locations in Belgrade, Vojvodina, and Golubac. Reaction Watching Ustanička ulica prompted screenwriter and former film critic Dimitrije Vojnov into posting a scathing blog entry on the recent state of contemporary Serbian cinema and Serbian movie audiences' viewing habits, while also reviewing Ustanička ulica itself. He's of the opinion that Serbian film theatre audiences have been conditioned into rejecting ambitious and well-crafted cinematic projects, referring to it as a \\"crisis of reception on the part of Serbian audiences\\" and blaming it on \\"years of being submerged in the residue of Serbian anti-films that mock any film form or standards\\". He thus expressed concern that Ustanička ulica, \\"a movie that doesn't pander or resort to sensationalism, will be ignored by the audiences much like similarly ambitious and well-executed Dejan Zečević's Neprijatelj was last year\\".USTANIČKA ULICA - odjeci i reagovanja;dobanevinosti.blogspot.com, 16 March 2012 Critical reception The film received mixed reviews. Writing for web magazine Popboks, Đorđe Bajić opines that \\"despite being promoted as a provocative political film, it's hard to imagine Ustanička ulica generating any kind of political discussion\\", adding: \\"Yes, there are politics in this movie, but they've largely been marginalized and pushed to the side. Additionally, the film's politics have downright been rendered inconsequential by the screenplay gaffes\\". He further praises Miroslav Terzić's direction and Fehmiu's portrayal of Mićun/Sredoje, but has big problems with the \\"film's second-rate screenplay that seriously erodes its overall credibility\\", saying: \\"It's hard to believe such an ambitious film even went into production with a script full of glaring dramaturgical oversights and uneven parts, including one unbelievable and unnecessary coincidence, forced parallelism, numerous naivetés, mishandled characters, two-bit dialogues...\\"Bura u čaši vode;Popboks, 13 March 2012 Along similar lines, Dubravka Lakić of Politika praises the film's polished look (\\"brings American movies and television crime dramas to mind\\") and atmosphere in addition to Terzić's directorial skills as well as director of photography Miladin Čolaković's camera work, while having issues with the film's wider context and its screenplay. She disapproves of the \\"way the screenwriters divide Serbs in two groups by pinning the war crimes guilt squarely on Serbs from outside of Serbia, while absolving Serbs from Serbia of everything\\". Furthermore, she feels the screenplay is the movie's weakest link as it \\"contains script gaffes, dramaturgical oversights, as well as far too many coincidences, parallels, and arbitrary decisions, even occasional naive characterization with several characters completely mishandled\\".Пао наредбодавац;Politika, 15 March 2012 Blic's Milan Vlajčić concludes his review by calling Ustanička ulica a \\"refreshing event that's worthy of careful viewing in the pretty precarious contemporary Serbian cinema\\".

Built in 1846, the building was one of the earliest hotels built in the city. The hotel, along with many other structures in the city, was destroyed in 1864 during the Battle of Atlanta.  History  Washington Hall was constructed by James Loyd in late 1846 at the intersection of Loyd Street (later Central Avenue) and the Georgia Railroad line in downtown Atlanta. Loyd had purchased the site in 1844. The building was one of the Atlanta's earliest hotels. The Atlanta Hotel was constructed earlier in 1846 and the Trout House followed in 1849. Loyd operated the hotel for almost a year before leasing the building to H. C. Holcombe and Zachariah A. Rice in October 1847. Two years later, after their lease had expired and Rice had departed for the California gold fields, Loyd again managed the hotel for several years before selling the property. The hotel was a two-story tall brick and wood building. It was described as being of \\"uncertain architecture\\" due to the constant renovations and expansions it underwent shortly after its construction to accommodate the rapid growth of Atlanta preceding the Civil War. According to multiple sources, the Atlanta Hotel was the more upscale of the two buildings. Like many of the buildings in Atlanta at the time, the hotel was destroyed during General Sherman's burning of Atlanta, wherein a scorched earth policy was employed; the Atlanta Hotel also suffered the same fate. When Atlanta was rebuilt after the war, another famous Atlanta hotel, Markham House, replaced Washington Hall in 1875. Like Washington Hall, Markham House would also be destroyed by fire, as it burned down in 1896.

Despite all of this, Carola secretly wishes to leave Great Gavel with Hariru because she hates how they treat Pokémon and people. Carola cares deeply for Hariru and shares an almost sister-brotherly bond with him.

Those who can use Burst are known as . It is stated that in order to use Burst, one must go through rigorous training or else their life will be in danger if they attempt it. If one is defeated while in Burst form, they will automatically change back to normal. =Burst Heart= A is a small, pocket sized jewel that actually holds a Pokémon inside of it, sealed so that its power can be used by anyone wishing to fuse with it. The Burst Heart can be compared to a Poké Ball in that it holds a Pokémon inside, but is also different due to the fact that it doesn't store a Pokémon to be released for later use. If a Burst Heart is broken, the Pokémon inside will be freed. It is not known how a Burst Heart is made, but have been created by Great Gavel. Once Burst is activated, the user will have their physical traits increased greatly. Whatever abilities the user will get depends on the type of Pokémon used to combine; for example, a Ground-type Pokémon will make the user immune to Electric attacks. It is stated that in order to use Burst, one must go through rigorous training or else their life will be in danger if they attempt it. It is shown that a person can actually be sent inside of their Burst Heart in order to better connect with the Pokémon inside. In Ryouga's Burst Heart, an entire field can be seen inside and a large area where his Zekrom is being held. Once he arrives to this spot, a key takes the form of a young gatekeeper boy to test him and see if he's worthy enough of seeing Zekrom. Once Ryouga passes the test, the boy turns back into his true form—a key—and allows him to see Zekrom. It is later revealed that a Burst Heart—like the Pokémon they contain—can become stronger as they get involved in more battles. This allows the Burst itself to become stronger at the same time as the Burst Warrior. =Compass of Light= The is a large crystal-like object that has the ability to search out Burst Hearts. Once a Burst Heart is put inside one of its six grooves, it will emit a beam of light that will seek out any other Burst Heart in the vicinity. The more Burst Hearts that are nearby, the more beams of light will seek them out. Also, the thicker the beam is, the stronger the person that possesses the Burst Heart is. According to Hariru, if the \\"six original Burst Hearts\\" are put inside of the grooves, Ryouga will be able to find the person he has been searching for, Arcades. =Burst Heart Survival= is a tournament for Burst Warriors in the Pokémon RéBURST manga.

It was published by game company Jeux Descartes from 1985 to 1994 and was the first original French-language horror role-playing game. Although it had well-crafted adventures, it lost market share to Chaosium's Call of Cthulhu, which expanded on the fanbase that Maléfices itself had created. This is ironic because Call of Cthulhu was printed earlier under license by Jeux Descartes as l'Appel de Cthulhu, starting with their translation of Chaosium's Second Edition of the rules in 1984. The core rules have been published in three editions: the 1st in 1985 and 2nd (Revised Edition) in 1988 by Jeux Descartes. The expanded 3rd Edition (288 pages long - triple the size of the earlier volumes) was printed in 2004 by Editions du Club Pythagore. They began work on new material, publishing the adventures Danse Macabre (\\"The Grim Dance\\") and La Cornemuse du Vieux Jeremiah (\\"Old Jeremiah's Bagpipes\\"), and sold PDFs of the old material. The 3rd Edition was later reprinted in 2007 by Asmodée Éditions. In 2016 Arkhane Asylum Publishing received the rights to Maléfices from Michel Gaudo. In October of 2018 they were crowdfunded through Ulule to begin work on a new version of the game (comprising a new core book, game screen, and Tarot Deck), with new supporting material to come. They would also reissue compatible versions of the old supplements and adventures. The first reissues are to be Une Étrange Maison de Poupée (\\"A Strange Doll's House\\") and Le Drame de la Rue des Récollets (\\"A Drama on the Street of the Recollects\\"). A gaming magazine, L’Étoile du Matin (\\"The Morning Star\\"), would also be created that would exclusively print articles and material supporting Maléfices. As of yet the company has not accomplished any of these goals. Setting Maléfices - le jeu de rôle qui sent le soufre... (\\"the role-playing game with the scent of sulphur\\") The game is set during the early part of the French Third Republic (1870–1940). It is a time where the reason, science and industry of the cities is confronting the superstitions, legends, and witchcraft of the countryside. The players' characters are ordinary people, who belong to le Club Pythagore (\\"The Pythagorean Club\\"), an association of gentlemen (and ladies) dedicated to fighting the darkness, with the help of Faith, Science, or even Magic. The players must expect mystery and the supernatural rather than the gore and overt fantastical elements of other horror games. However, whether the threat is a haunted house or a mad scientist, the cloven footprints of the Devil are found not far off. Much like Call of Cthulhu, Malefices was about investigators trying to stop evil forces from destroying mankind but just delaying the inevitable for a while. The start of the First World War in 1914 apparently heralds the beginning of the end. Mechanics The game uses a pair of ten-sided dice and a deck of tarot cards to resolve actions. A d10 roll would use the results of one ten-sided die. A d100 roll uses one ten- sided die of one color as the \\"tens\\" column and one ten-sided die as the \\"ones\\" column to generate percentages. A color-coded table divided by percents or ranges of numbers generated by the dice indicates the results (much like TSR's Marvel Super Heroes RPG). The results are divided into \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\", \\"D\\" and \\"Failure\\", like a report card. \\"A\\" is a perfect or \\"excellent\\" result that is an automatic success. The others are spectrums of success with \\"B\\" being \\"good\\", \\"C\\" being \\"average\\" and \\"D\\" being \\"borderline\\". \\"Failure\\" is an automatic failure, but its degree is judged by subtracting the result of the botched roll from the value of the maximum level of success. The results are modified by drawing tarot cards, much like the Poker deck used in Classic Deadlands. One interesting mechanic is that the La Chance (\\"Luck\\") card grants the character an extra life when drawn and the La Mort (\\"Death\\") card allows the MJ (Meneur de Jeu, or \\"Game Master\\") to kill the character whenever he chooses. An interesting effect is that players who have the \\"Death\\" card hovering over them might engage in risky behavior that requires the drawing of more cards in the hope of drawing a \\"Luck\\" card, much like a gambler in the hole might do. Attributes Personnages Joueurs (\\"Player Characters\\") have seven attributes: 4 Bodily attributes, 2 Spiritual Attributes, and 1 Magical Attribute. Each attribute score has a minimum level of 1 and a maximum of 20. Player Characters' Spiritual and Magical attributes have set minimum levels to set them apart from most Non-Player Characters and to give them a better chance of success. The player first picks a profession and has to roll on a d100 chart for the Age and Constitution of the character, which affect the bodily attributes. (Female characters have period-based limitations on the professions they may choose.) The four bodily attributes are Capacités Physiques (\\"Physical Abilities\\", or Strength), Habileté (\\"Ability\\" or Dexterity), Culture Générale (\\"General Knowledge\\" or Education), and Perception (\\"Alertness\\"). Capacités Physiques is based on Age, Constitution, and Profession, while the latter three (Habileté, Culture Générale, and Perception) are just based on Age and Profession. The two opposing spiritual attributes are Ouverture d'Esprit (\\"Open-Mindedness\\", or Reason) and Spiritualité (\\"Spirituality\\", or Faith). They are point-based and are created by dividing 20 points between them (much like the contrasting attributes in the Pendragon RPG). Characters start with a minimum level of 6 in either attribute. These attributes have a lot of in-game effects, but in general Ouverture d'Esprit gives a bonus to resist fear and Spiritualité gives a bonus to resist occult manipulation. Fluide (\\"Flow\\" or \\"Supernatural Powers\\"), the seventh attribute (with a minimum level of 5), is secretly rolled by the Meneur de Jeu for the character. It determines how well they can manipulate the supernatural realm. It grants a bonus to one of the three magical attributes (all of which normally have a base level of \\"0\\"). Seuil de Pratique de la Magie Blanche (SPMB, \\"Threshold for Practicing White Magic\\") and Seuil de Pratique de la Magie Noire (SPMN, \\"Threshold for Practicing Black Magic\\") are the attributes for the use of magic. Seuil de Pratique de la Magie Autre (SPMA, \\"Threshold for Practicing Other Magic\\") is the attribute for using Psychic powers or sensing the supernatural realm. Only the Mener de Jeu knows what the bonus is and to which form of magic it applies. This keeps magic and psychic powers a dangerous mystery to the players. To every magical effect, a number is associated, called Seuil de Pratique de l'Acte (SPA, \\"Threshold for Practice of the Act\\"). This gives the difficulty of the effect and the chance for side-effects and botches. Fluide rolls are handled as the opposite of Skill or Action rolls (kind of like The Devil was making the roll rather than the player). A failure means there are no consequences and \\"D\\", \\"C\\", \\"B\\" and \\"A\\" are botches. A botched roll has dire consequences, with \\"D\\" being minor and \\"A\\" being serious or even deadly for the character. Then a spread of five Tarot cards are drawn, like a hand of Poker. Four are shown to the player and one is kept secret by the Meneur de Jeu (the Dealer). They are interpreted to affect the character, granting bonuses and penalties to Fluide and the types of magic. For example L'Archange (\\"the Archangel\\") and Le Vicaire (\\"the Priest\\") give bonuses to Spiritualité and SPMB, Le Diable (\\"The Devil\\") and Le Sorcier (\\"The Sorcerer\\") give bonuses to Ouverture d'Esprit and SPMN, and Le Grand Livre (\\"The Great Grimoire\\") gives you bonuses to Fluide, Ouverture d'Esprit and Spiritualité. The hidden card and its influence is kept secret from the player. Rules Sets =First Edition / Revised (Second Edition)= The first and second edition rules came in a box set with the rulebook, adventure booklet, 4-panel game master screen, 2 ten-sided dice, 20 cardboard tarot cards, and 21 two-sided cardboard character figures with plastic standee bases. The Tarot deck (referred to as le Grand Jeu de la Connaissance - \\"the Great Game of Knowledge\\") was designed by LeCordelier and illustrated by Gilles Lautussier. In the First Edition, the Tarot cards were in black and white and were unfinished pre-punched white cardboard with a plain back. The deck in the Revised Edition was in color, the cards were laminated, and had a pattern on the back. The Rulebook was 56 pages. It contained a 2-page foreword titled La Mare au Diable (\\"The Devil's Pond\\"), 25 pages of rules, 25 pages of historical and cultural information, a 2-page bibliography, a Table of Contents page, and an afterword page titled \\"The Bear\\". The rules covered character creation, the system mechanics, the combat rules, magic rules, and the creation and use of Non-Player Characters, animals and supernatural creatures. The historical material was divided into three parts. \\"France between 1870 and 1914\\" was an 11-page historical essay covering the Belle Époque period. \\"Chronicle\\" was a 4-page timeline of French history. \\"Witchcraft, Beliefs and Superstition in Nineteenth-century France\\" was a 10-page essay discussing occult practices of the time. The 48-page Adventure Booklet contained a four page article of cultural and sociological data about France at the turn of the century. It also contained the two beginning scenarios La Malédiction de Fontevrault (The Curse at Fontevrault) and Une Etrange Maison de Poupées (A Strange Dolls' House). =Third Edition= The third edition was a 288-page hardcover book. A great deal of it (136 pages total) is historical and sociological information. Lever de Rideau (\\"Raising The Curtain\\") is a 23-page article describing previous historical eras in French history: the First Empire [1804-1815], the Bourbon Restoration [1814-1830], the July Monarchy [1830-1848], the Second Republic [1848-1852], and the Second Empire [1852-1870]. It also discusses the great influences of the Year of Revolution [1848], the Franco-Prussian war [1870-1871] and the Commune of Paris [1871]. \\"The Third Republic\\" [1870-1940] is a 23-page section on the conflicting social and political concepts of the Belle Époque period [1870-1914], from the beginning of the Franco-Prussian War to the dawn of World War One. \\"Chronicle\\" is a 34-page timeline of French history from 1870 to 1914. \\"Life in 1900\\" is a 20-page section that details the lifestyle, fashions, leisure activities, and habits of the period for both the city and the countryside. The \\"Belle Époque Guide\\" is a 20-page section detailing printed news media, modes of travel (train, carriage and early motor cars), and communication methods (the postal service, telegraph and telephone) of the Belle Époque period. \\"Crime and Punishment\\" is a 20-page section on the police services, investigative and forensic techniques of the period, the Law, procedures of trial and judgement, and typical sentences and punishments. There is also a 16-page section on the scientific, spiritual, and occult theories and beliefs of the period like evolution, Spiritualism, and anti- clericalism. Scenarios =Beginning Aventures=  La Malédiction de Fontevrault (\\"The Curse at Fontevrault\\") [1985] First Edition Rules (21 pages)  In July 1900, the characters are invited by the Countess Sophie of Arbrissel to her home on an isolated country estate in Brittany. There, strange events will take place. News of a dangerous escaped prisoner...a stormy night...a Spiritualism seance...what does all this have to do with the nearby prison of Fontevrault? The characters will see their nerves tested and must use their wits to understand the Curse of Fontevrault.  Une Etrange Maison de Poupées (\\"A Strange Dolls' House\\") [1985] by Michel Gaudo. First Edition Rules (21 pages)  In September 1902, the characters are invited to attend a session of the Pythagorean Club by its President, Monsieur Caton. This very discreet club is interested in all activities of human thought and is recruiting members of an open, inquisitive and objective mind. A strange package arrives at the club: a doll's house, which is full of mysteries. Attached to it is a letter reading: \\"Businessman, to be away a few days seeks person of confidence that can keep his children. Contact Mr Léon Berthomé, Rue Pergolèse, 16th District, Paris.\\" Will the characters respond to the attached announcement?  La Jeune Fille et la Mort (\\"Death and the Maiden\\") [2005] Third Edition Rules (9 pages)  The characters attend the theater when an accident occurs. The characters must figure out what is happening.  L'enfant de Colére (\\"The Child of Wrath\\") [2005] Third Edition Rules (44 pages) Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the Children of Wrath, even as others. \\\\- Ephesians 2:3, King James Bible. The characters are members of \\"The Friends of Rimbaud\\", a literary society devoted to the poetry of Arthur Rimbaud [1854-1891]. The adventure involves the characters meeting while attending the 10th anniversary commemorative mass for the late poet, with backdrop in the towns of Charleville and Mézières in the Ardennes. They will have to unravel why one of their friends was the target of an assassination attempt. On the way they will contend with a desecrated grave, a variety of crooks and thieves, and a murderous psychopath. =Modules= The modules had a few interesting quirks. Every module had a La Mare au Diable (\\"The Devil's Pond\\") section, providing a preface from the editor. This was followed by the Recreation section, a rebus puzzle that would be answered in the next module. Each module had numerous props and handouts that the players could search for clues, along with articles and short stories for flavor. They also had panels of illustrations that would allow the game master to describe the written scenes more vividly.  No.1 Le drame de la rue des Récollets (\\"A Tragedy in the Street of the Recollects\\") [Jeux Descartes 1985 (1st edition)] by Michel Gaudo.  The investigators go to Versailles at the invitation of Madame Hyacinthe Passelat, the local bookseller. Can we dream of a city quieter than Versailles, so close to the capital and yet so full of provincial sweetness? But should we trust appearances? Is her house truly haunted or is she prone to imaginary fears? However, it seems that in the night at the house in the Rue des Récollets, the walls cry! But how can anyone believe such a thing?  No.2 L'énigmatique carnet du Capitaine Pop Plinn (\\"The Puzzling Notebook of Captain Pop Plinn\\") [Jeux Descartes 1985 (1st edition)] by Hervé Fontanières  Who can say what happened to Professor Labessonnier, director of the lunatic asylum at Rennes, gone nearly five months ago? Is he gone, like everyone suggests, in search of Captain Pop Plinn, one of his own patients, who escaped from the hospital a year earlier? Camille Labessonnier, the daughter of the alienist, despaired by months of fruitless searches, gathers a group of reliable friends for a last- ditch attempt. To guide them, they will have available to them the strange captain's log book, found twice on the same beach in Finistère. Is the key to the mystery hidden in the obscure prose of a madman? Can they expect to trace the two men? But what power lies at the end of this pilgrimage through the beauties and mysteries of the Breton countryside? Features an article about the Broceliande forest in Brittany and its connections to Arthurian legend, selected black & white plates by Aubrey Beardsley from his illustrated version of Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur, and a brief biography of the artist.  No.3 Délivrez-nous du mal (\\"Deliver Us from Evil...\\") [1986] by Hervé Fontanières  In the month of June, there is peace at the monastery of St. Bernard of Bel-Ange. Life goes on away from the fury of men in the quiet, unchanging rhythm of prayer and meditation. They are four monks for whom fulfillment is found within the walls of this Cistercian abbey, where they spent most of their existence and where they hope to complete it. One of their old comrades, Brother Julian, just left them. But they chased the sadness from their hearts because they are convinced that after death begins a new life. And then suddenly, everything seems to be falling into chaos. Should the cook doubt his art, the steward of his honesty, the gardener of his dedication, the librarian's ability to resist the lure of bad books? What is this storm of madness which suddenly starts to blow on the monastery? Is it a man or a demon who, in the shadow of the cloister, has vowed to plunge this house of prayer into confusion? The player characters are monks at St. Bernard's who are drawn to investigate a series of mysteries. Features articles on the Catholic Church during the 3rd Republic, typical life in a monestary, and the Rule of Silence, and a short timeline detailing the anti-clerical struggle in France from 1902 to 1905.  No.4 Les brasiers ne s'éteignent jamais(\\"The Fires Never Burn Out\\") [1986] by Michel Gaudo  No, the fires never go out. In 17th century Loudun, Father Urbain Grandier, the pastor at the parish of St.Pierre-du- Marche, perished in flames at the stake. Thus ended the most famous case of witchcraft that has ever been heard. More than 300 years later, Loudon is about to feel the priest's vengeance. Will the innocent people perish? Demons lurk around the peaceful town; will they need to be paid in souls for the fires to be extinguished at last? The player characters, previously unknown to each other, are summoned to Loudun to receive an inheritance. A series of strange events force them to work together to solve the mystery. Includes an essay on the Grandier trial.  No.5 Le dompteur de volcans (\\"The Tamer of Volcanoes\\") [1986] by Michel Gaudo  A wave of madness is blowing through the Pythagorean Club. Judge for yourself: a fakir came to give a lecture - a young girl does not hesitate to tell us - on the secrets of his body. Then the rush of events: disappearances, killings, and prosecutions shake the club members. The press is unleashed, the capital is in turmoil - even the provinces are not immune. Amid this whirlwind of events, can you remain calm enough to oppose the terrible threat of The Tamer of Volcanoes? The first part of the adventure is a slow-paced investigation into an assault on a club member and the disappearance and murder of a strange woman. The second part is a race against time involving a train trip into the countryside of Auvergne, the abduction of a woman from a circus, and a confrontation with a mad scientist. Includes a study of the Birman Fakirs, the short story Oil of Dog by Ambrose Bierce, a two-dimensional cardboard cutout of an antique statue, a color poster for the eccentric Cirque de Roumanoff, and a dozen handouts and props.  No.6 Enchères sous pavillon noir (\\"Bidding on a Black Banner\\") [Jeux Descartes 1987] by Pascal Gaudo The investigators buy a chest containing an old pirate flag at auction and get involved in a Caribbean deep- sea treasure hunt. They aren't the only ones, however. There is a shadowy and formidable rival group that is following their trail that is as \\"greedy\\" as they are. Also includes information about Voodoo and the lives of pirates.  No.7 La musique adoucit les meurtres (\\"Music Makes Murders Much Sweeter\\") [1987] by Michel Gaudo  \\"When I want to kill, I kill; I often do just that, and no one is stopping me. Human laws even pursue me with their revenge, but my conscience does not reproach me.\\" \\\\- _Les Chants de Maldoror_ , Fourth Canto by the Comte de Lautréamont (1868). Wherein the members of the Pythagorean Club will get to know the little brother of Fantômas, which like his predecessor is: \\"...always someone (sometimes two people), but never himself\\". In this sequel to Une Etrange Maison de Poupées, the players must contend with a clever enemy out to exact his dark revenge upon them.  No.8 :Le montreur d'ombres (\\"The Caster of Shadows\\") [1987] by Hervé Fontanières  On the gentle shores of Lake Annecy, a great event is in the making. The charming resort of Haute-Savoie is home to the first congress of a newly founded academy of the sciences and humanities. Among the greatest scholars from around the world, the characters will be striving with the most illustrious. So much so that they can (why not?) lay claim to the presidency of the association. But while everyone gets drunk with pride in this race for honors, the characters are quickly and inexplicably struck by serious mental disorders that will only worsen. Will they end their life in an asylum, suffering from early senility just when Glory held out her arms? Unless the reality is much worse ... In these circumstances, is it really time to take their testimony seriously? Does an aquatic monster really haunt the lake bottom?  No.9 Folies viennoises (A pun meaning either \\"Viennese Cabaret\\" or \\"Viennese Madness\\") [1988] by Daniel Bilous & Nicole Bilous  :\\"Mein herr, the Waltz is a rhythm of three parts: two parts weak and a third movement that is nearly painfully accentuated. It is the exact rhythm of a heart attack. In the thrall of an intense fear, no matter how fast the chambers of the heart accelerate, the rhythm slowly becomes regular. Have you not noticed those times in the past in Vienna when the fast-paced Polka has nearly dethroned the slow-moving Waltz?\\" ::\\"So am I hearing you say, Herr Doktor, that her terror is supposed to be a normal state?\\" :\\"Perhaps it is for the best, Herr Kommissar, perhaps it is for the best...\\" A mystery that takes place in Vienna in 1907, in which a local girl goes mad from fright. The players meet Dr. Sigmund Freud, who is a consulting doctor in the case. Includes information on Vienna and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Anarchism in Europe, and the Vienna Secession and Bauhaus movements.  No.10 :Cœur cruel (\\"Cruel Heart\\") [1988] by Hervé Fontanières  When reading a single letter takes you to hundreds of kilometers from home. Where a mysterious hand goes after the remnants of the past. Where the possessed babble incomprehensible messages. Where, after nearly 700 years, the shadow of the Baron still hangs over Bearn. Where, again and always, love and death find themselves united by blood ties. When life itself becomes unbearable. Where destinies are based, for better or for worse? Where finally no, you do not laugh when you do not see yourself in the mirror...  No.11 Le voile de Kali: (\\"The Veil of Kali\\") [1994] by Michel Gaudo & Pascal Gaudo (112 pages)  The story that the characters will be involved has an international dimension. Involuntarily, they will find themselves immersed in a conflict that is between the French intelligence services and their German rivals, in this case represented by a secret society: The Holy Vehm. French and Germans will try to capture the terrible secret of the Veil of Kali. Very soon they will find that it is extremely dangerous to handle dark forces ... especially when you do not control them! Perhaps had they been wiser not to attempt to lift a corner of the veil... But now it's too late to turn their backs to dark powers that once lay dormant for centuries but were woken from their torpor. There remains only one solution ... to conquer or die! The characters find themselves traveling from Egypt to Ceylon to Istanbul and then back to Paris on the Orient Express.  No.12 Danse macabre (\\"The Grim Dance\\") [Editions du Club Pythagore 2004] by Daniel Dugourd  The adventure starts with a formal dinner, followed by a seance. On the way home, the characters witness a robbery and murder at the Musée de Cluny. The investigators must investigate the crime (and discover what Camille Saint-Saëns' composition Danse Macabre has to do with it all...). Contains historical information on the role and influence of the Catholic Church during the Third Republic and the conflicts between religious and anti-clerical groups in France between 1870 and 1900. Also includes 32 pages of handouts, including a cardboard sheet with the drawing of a triptych, the text of the poem \\"Danse Macabre\\" by Henri Cazalis, and a Club Pythagore membership card and letter of acceptance.  No.13 La cornemuse du vieux Jeremiah (\\"Old Jeremiah's Bagpipes\\") [Editions du Club Pythagore 2005] by Daniel Dugourd  One of the characters has recently inherited an estate and a title from his recently deceased rich uncle...along with a family curse and a haunted castle. While staying at his estate in the Highlands of Scotland, he and his guests hear the mysterious sound of bagpipes playing on the moor. Who is playing the bagpipes? Who is trying to kill the host, the last member of the St.Simon family? And what secrets does the history of this noble lineage have to reveal? Contains a map of Great Britain, a London newspaper (in French, of course), historical information about Scotland from ancient to modern times (1880s), and 37 pages of handouts.  Les Chasses du Comte Lassary (\\"The Hunts of Count Lassary\\") [1991] by Michel Gaudo.  \\"When a man wants to kill a tiger. he calls it sport; When a tiger wishes to kill him, he calls it ferocity...\\" \\\\- _Maxims for Revolutionists_ , Line 62 by George Bernard Shaw (1903) The characters have been summoned to the reading of the will of the late Count Lassary, a celebrated hunter. The will appears fake but declares that the testators are all here to search for the real will to give the Count's estate to the true heir.  l'Oeil du Diademe (\\"The Eye of the Tiara\\") Michel Gaudo [Editions du Club Pythagore Unpublished]  A scenario that was never put into production. It was advertised in the adventure Danse Macabre (2004) that it was originally going to be No. 13 in the series. Asmodee Editions also announced in 2007 that it was coming out soon, but it remains unfinished. Its title refers to an optical illusion (Trompe l'Oeil) in the background of a self-portrait by Nicolas Poussin (1594 – 1665). The viewer's eyes are drawn to a colorful painting in the background over the painter's shoulder rather than to the drab-colored painter himself in the foreground. The painting is of a woman in classic garb who is wearing a tiara with a small red gem in its peak. Conspiracy theorists have said that Poussin's paintings contain secret codes or clues. Perhaps the players have to uncover a plot or conspiracy using the clues provided by Poussin's paintings? Supplements = A la Lisière de la Nuit (At the Edge of Night) [Jeux Descartes 1986 (1st edition rules)] by Hervé Fontanières, Michel Gaudo & Guillaume Rohmer = A Sorcery supplement that brings together magic rules and historic examples of spells. Black magic is used for personal purposes and can be done by making a pact with the Devil, while white magic aims for spiritual elevation. These sortilèges de malefices (hex spells) are not instantaneous and spectacular like balls of fire or curses. No, they are subtle, like protective charms and potions of Love and Luck. This supplement covers magic and folk superstitions rather than Spiritualism and psychic powers. = Le Bestiaire (The Bestiary) [Jeux Descartes 1988 (2nd edition rules)] by Michel Gaudo & Pascal Gaudo = The sourcebook is a series of extracts from a variety of sources about animals and monsters, rather than full of statistics or concrete depictions. It is more of an atmospheric guide to help stimulate the Game Master's imagination (and keep investigators from guessing what's really going on). It also contains a brief recounting of the magic rules from A la Lisière de la Nuit. = Enfer et Lieux Maudits (Hell and Cursed Places) [Unpublished] = A sourcebook full of sources describing Hell and The Devil and listing famous cursed locations across France was proposed. However, the series was cancelled by Jeux Descartes in the early 1990s before it could be finished and published. = CatéSchisme (A pun implying Doctrine of Factionalization) [Asmodee Editions 2007 (3rd edition rules)] by Olivier Babarit, Daniel Dugourd, Michel Gaudo, & Jean-Philippe Palanchini = \\"When they no longer have priests, the gods become very easy to live with.\\" \\\\- _L'Histoire contemporaine №.4: Monsieur Bergeret à Paris_ , by Anatole France (1901). This supplement is composed of a new four-panel Game Master screen, a new color 22-card Tarot Card set, and a 32-page information booklet about Spiritualism. The booklet is divided in 3 parts. Superstitions et Diableries (\\"Superstitions and Deviltry\\") is a sermon given by a horrified Catholic priest that denounces Spiritualism. Les Forces Invisibles (\\"The Invisible Forces\\") is by a scientist who attended Spiritualist seances and is trying to explain what he saw scientifically. Sciences Secrètes des initiés (\\"The Initiates' Secret Knowledge\\") is a lecture by an occultist named Dr. Theobald to a society called the Voiles d'Isis (\\"The Veils of Isis\\") on how occultism is superior to Science and Spiritualism. Sidebars contain rules for carrying out Spiritualist rituals and using Spiritualist paraphernalia like Spirit Mirrors and Ouija Boards to aid in investigations. = Le Club Pythagore [Arkhane Asylum Publishing 2019?] = A proposed supplement for the Arkhane Asylum Publishing edition. It will concern the club and its prominent members.

Catholic diocesan authorities with the expressed and written approval of the Pope in countries including Brazil, Korea, the Philippines, Spain, and the United States of America designate the Blessed Virgin Mary as their principal patroness. As part of the patronage, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception is often observed both religiously and culturally within these countries. Numerous national parades, processions and cultural festivities are associated with this patronage ranging from public holidays to holy day of obligation. Several Popes have conferred this title of patronage, sometimes initiated by bishops. The list below enumerates the various countries by which the Pope, through a papal bull has formally granted the Immaculate Conception as the patroness of the people and its land or kingdom. The list of Pontifical declaration does not include Ireland, Nicaragua and Portugal. Brazil ' —An image of the Immaculate Conception statue as Our Lady of Aparecida that is venerated as national Patroness in Aparecida, Brazil. The Blessed Virgin Mary is the official Patroness of Brazil under the localized title Our Lady of Aparecida (Our Lady of Immaculate Conception (who) Appeared). * On 16 July 1930, Pope Pius XI declared the Immaculate Conception under the title of Our Lady of Aparecida to be the principal patroness of Brazil, namely widespread in the Archdiocese of Saint Sebastian of River of January. The pontifical decree indicated that Pope Leo XIII granted the approval on the devotion of the image under the title \\"Fossa Behihora de Gonceigao Apparecida\\". * On 8 December 1904, Pope Pius X granted a canonical coronation towards the image. In addition, the same Pontiff established the Office of the Mass under this honor and allowing this devotion to spread due to the widespread piety of the Brazilian people. The decree mentions the 1904 solid gold crown given to the image (assumingly from Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil). The devotion was researched and approved by Cardinal Camillo Laurenti, Prefect of the Sacred Congregation of Rites. The papal bull was signed and witnessed by Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli.Acta Apostolica Sedis - 1931 - Page 7 - Beata Virgo Maria Immaculata Sub Titulo Apparecida - Principalis Patrona Brasiliae Constituitur. - [1931]%20-%20ocr.pdf * Pope Pius XI declared Mary under this title Patroness of Brazil through a papal bull of 16 July 1930, signed by Cardinal Secretary of State Eugenio Pacelli. * Pope Paul VI granted the image her first golden rose on 12 August 1967. Ultimately, Pope John Paul II consecrated her new shrine and on the same date raised it to the rank of minor basilica on 4 July 1980. Korea French image of the Immaculate Conception at the Myeongdong Cathedral in Seoul, Korea. Amidst Christian suspicion and persecution at the time, Pope Gregory XVI invested ecclesiastical interest in strengthening the first bishopric in Korea. In 1831, he established the first and only Apostolic Vicariate in Korea which survived no foreign Catholic priests since the anti-Catholic persecutions that went on earlier that year.True Doctrine in the Hermit Kingdom: A Brief Survey of the Catholic Church in Korea - Brother Zechariah Foreman, Order of Preachers, published May 4, 2004 According to Cardinal Nicolas Cheong Jin-suk, in 1841, Pope Gregory XVI solemnly dedicated the Korean Catholic Church to the Virgin Mary under the title \\"Immaculate Virgin\\". On 6 May 1984, Pope John Paul II reiterated this patronage by entrusting the Republic of Korea to the Virgin Mary, given at the Myeong-dong Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Seoul, Korea. In the Apostolic Letter, John Paul II noted that Bishop Imbert Bum first consecrated Korea to the Immaculate Conception in 1837, followed by Bishop Jean Joseph Ferréol in 1846 along with Saint Joseph as its co-patron in the village of Surich’igol, nearby the city of Gongju. According to the papal brief, a similar re-dedication of patronage to the Immaculate Conception was invoked on by the French Bishop Gustave Charles Mutel (1854-1933) on 29 May 1898, when the cathedral was ceremoniously opened to the Korean public. Philippines ' — The statue of the Immaculate Conception in Manila Cathedral, sculpted by Italian national artist Vincenzo Assenza (1915—1981). In his papal bull Illius fulti praesidio, dated 6 February 1578, Pope Gregory XIII established the diocese of Manila and decreed that its cathedral should be under the invocation of the Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The same invocation was given to the cathedrals of Nueva Segovia and Cáceres by Pope Clement VIII by decree of 13 August 1595. After the Philippines ceased to become Spanish colony, the first Provincial Council of Manila petitioned the Holy See for the privilege to continue using blue vestments for the Feast of Immaculate Conception. Pope Pius X granted this request via in a special audience, with the privilege included in a list of indults granted to the Philippines, dated 11 February 1910, executed by Cardinal Rafael Merry del Val. By the Apostolic Letter Impositi Nobis of 12 September 1942, Pope Pius XII, at the request of the bishops in the Philippines, declared the Virgin Mary under the title of the Immaculate Conception as principal patroness of the Philippines with Saints Pudentiana and Rose of Lima as secondary patronesses, mentioning that the 1907 Provincial Council of Manila invoked \\"Maria Immaculata\\" as patroness of the whole Filipino people and that historical documents indicated Saint Pudentiana as Patroness of the Philippines from the 16th century and Saint Rose of Lima from the 17th.Insularum Philippinarum Beatissima Virgo Maria Titulo Immaculata Conceptio Primaria Universalisque Patrona et Sanctae Virgines Pudentiana ac Rosa Limana Patronae Secundarias Declarantur - Acta Apostolicae Sedis (1942) Pages 336-337 The bull only affected those patronesses of the Philippines that were ordinally ranked. Since 1571, Saint Pudentiana was principal patroness of the Philippines; and since 1670, Saint Rose of Lima was principal patroness of the Indies, thereby also becoming a de iure principal patroness of the Philippines. These two patronesses were demoted to secondary rank in deference to the Immaculate Conception. In contrast, Our Lady of Guadalupe as Heavenly Patroness of the Philippines since 16 July 1935 by Pope Pius XI was made null and void.Acta Apostolicae Sedis 28 (1936), pp.63f. - 16 Iulii (July) 1935.

XXX Among various fiestas and rituals honouring the Immaculate Conception's patronage is the annual Grand Marian Procession in Manila, where various statues of the Virgin Mary depicting her different titles and apparitions are borne in procession. The images are removed from their respective shrines and brought around the Spanish colonial capital district of Intramuros towards Manila Cathedral, which is dedicated to the Immaculate Conception. The event is administered both by the Cofradía de la Inmaculada Concepción and the Intramuros Administration, in cooperation with the City Government of Manila and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manila. The Philippines celebrated the 1954 Marian year by releasing a commemorative stamp featuring an image of the Immaculate Conception, and re-printed again in 1958. On 29 March 2017, the Philippine government through the House of Representatives approved Bill # 5241 declaring December 8 as a non-working official holiday, and was officially signed into constitutional law on 23 December 2017 under Republic Act No. 10966 by President Rodrigo Duterte in honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary as patroness of its country. Spain ' — In 1760, Pope Clement XIII settled the heated dispute in Spain, supported by royal decree, installing the Immaculate Conception as the Kingdom's patroness. \\"La Inmaculada Purisima Concepcion de Maria\\" by Bartolome Esteban Murillo, Prado, Spain. By Papal decree, the Immaculate Conception alone is the universal and national patroness of Spain, by virtue of a papal mandate issued by Pope Clement XIII on 8 November 1760, while Saint James the Greater remains, the same pope declared, the primary patron\\"quin primarius Sancti Iacobi Apostoli dignoscatur patronus\\" (Civiltà Cattolica 1851, p. 129) of the Spanish people. The feast of the Immaculate Conception is also one of the nine national and public holidays and a holy day of obligation. The patronage settles the dispute between a heated religious debate during the mid 1600s, when followers of the mythical figure Saint James Matamoros wished to impose him as the national patron saint versus the followers of Saint Teresa of Avila. On 11 September 1759, the elected members of the Spanish Cortes petitioned King Charles III of Spain to request from the pope the \\"universal patronage of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception in all the Kingdoms of Spain and the Indies\\". With the papal bull Quantum ornamenti of 8 November 1760, Pope Clement granted the request of King Charles III, declaring the Virgin Mary, under the title of the Immaculate Conception, patroness of the whole of the Kingdom of Spain along with its eastern and western territories,\\"in universo Hispaniensi Regno, eiusque Orientalibus, Occidentalibusque Indiis\\" (Civiltà Cattolica 1851, p. 129) (in the Americas and the Philippines).\\"Vix Carolus III sceptrum suscepit, ad Reginae Coelorum pedes confestim illud libentissime locavit, utque omnes Hispaniae incolae tanto firmarentur patrocinio, tantoque munirentur praesidio, Sanctissimam Virginem in Conceptionis Immaculatae ineffabili mysterio totius regni elegit Patronam; huic adimplendo scopo, anno 1760 celebratis Comitiis, et ad Summum Pontificem Clementem XIII evectis precibus, die 8 Novembris ipsiusmet anni Bullam: Quantum ornamenti, impetravit, in qua Virginem sub glorioso Conceptionis mysterio in universo Hispaniensi Regno, eiusque Orientalibus, Occidentalibusque Indiis Patronam venerari decrevit quin primarius Sancti Iacobi Apostoli dignoscatur Patronus, praecipiensque etiam Summus Pontifex ecclesiasticos cunctos tam saeculares, quam Regulares hoc festum cum ritu primae classis diligenter servare, ac plenariam Indulgentiam impertiens omnibus, et singulis, qui conditiones Litteris Apostolicis praescriptas explerent.\\" Pareri sulla definizione dogmatica dell'Immacolato Concepimento della Beata Virgine Maria (Civiltà Cattolica 1851), pp. 128-129 In another document, Pope Clement granted that the Spanish clergy could celebrate the Mass and the Liturgy of the Hours on the feast and its octave with the texts used by the Franciscans rather than that in the Tridentine Roman Missal and Roman Breviary as revised by Pope Pius V, which did not attach the adjective \\"Immaculate\\" to the phrase \\"Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary\\".\\"Insuper ab ipso Maximo Pontifice ecclesiasticos omnes Missam celebrare posse, et officium divinum persolvere dei festi et octavae sicut Francisci Minorum Ordo celebrabat et persolvebat, etiam obtinuit\\" (Civiltà Cattolica 1851, p. 129) On the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, the brief Dance of the Sixteen (Spanish: Los Seises) (the actual number of choirboys dancing has been reduced to twelve) is performed by choirboys dressed in white and blue in the Cathedral of Seville. Since 1864, Mass vestments for the feast in Spain may be blue at the expressed permission with decree from the Sacred Congregation of Rites which thus became extended to the former territories of the Spanish crown and kingdom. Many other Spanish cultural customs and religious processions are associated with the feast. United States of America ' — A mosaic rendition of the Immaculate Conception of the Royal Palace of Aranjuez sent by Pope Pius XI in 1923, permanently enshrined at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception of Washington D.C. On 13 May 1846, the United States bishops unanimously chose the Virgin Mary, conceived without sin, as patroness of the country, a decision approved by Pope Pius IX on February 7 of the following year and published in a decree of 2 July 1847. On 10 April 1848, a voting process and discussion was made on the regularisation of the rubrics for the Feast of the Immaculate Conception to be celebrated in that country. By 1849, this decree was published at the 7th Provincial Council of Baltimore. The decrees were signed and witnessed by Cardinal Giacomo Filippo Fransoni. On 8 July 1914, Pope Pius X sent an apostolic letter to Archbishop of Baltimore Cardinal James Gibbons approving the patronage of the Immaculate Conception for the new construction site of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. On 10 April 1919, Pope Benedict XV reiterated this patronage and stated that he had ordered a mosaic of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception to be made in the Vatican Mosaic Studio for the shrine's high altar. In 1923, Pope Pius XI chose a mosaic version of Bartolomé Esteban Murillo's La Purísima Inmaculada Concepción for installation at the shrine, the image is a mosaic rendition of the venerated Immaculate Conception enshrined at the Royal Palace of Aranjuez. now installed in the largest Roman Catholic church in the United States of America. List of countries claiming Patronage but no Pontifical decree =Ireland= On 7 December 1650, the Irish Catholic Confederation, on the verge of its final defeat by the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, declared the Virgin Mother of God, under the title of the Immaculate Conception, patroness of the Kingdom of Ireland. Information on this declaration, which was never formally adopted by the Church nor approved by any Papal decree, is given in a letter written six days later: =Nicaragua= ' — In 1562, Don Lorenzo Ahumada, a brother of Saint Teresa of Avila, brought to Nicaragua this statue of the Immaculate Conception of El Viejo. Pope John Paul II granted a Canonical coronation towards the venerated Marian image on 28 December 1989. The Immaculate Conception is venerated as Patroness of the Nicaraguan people. A letter of 1673 cites a document of 5 January 1626 according to which the statue was given by Saint Teresa of Avila to her brother, who brought it to where it now is and died there. Another document, drawn up in 1751 after a visit to the settlement of El Viejo, where the statue is kept, and citing the 1673 letter, states that the name \\"Nuestra Señora del Viejo\\" was a reference to Saint Teresa's brother, who was then an old man (\\"viejo\\" being Spanish for \\"old\\"). It describes the statue and its adornment, including a crown. A traditional story is that the statue was brought by an old hermit who, when the ship he was travelling on refused to leave the harbour, explained that the statue wished to remain there. A Carmelite report of 1786 recorded the tradition that the statue was a gift of Saint Teresa to her brother or uncle, who was governor of the locality, and that, when he attempted to take the statue with him when transferred to another governorship, storms repeatedly drove his ship back, so that he left the statue there. Another source gives the name of Saint Teresa's brother as Don Lorenzo de Cepeda and repeats the story of the storm forcing him to leave the statue in what was then called Chamulpa and is now El Viejo. The statue was ceremoniously crowned by the local townspeople in 1747. Pope John Paul II issued the Papal bull for the Canonical coronation for the image on 28 December 1989, which was signed and executed by Cardinal Agostino Casaroli. On 7 February 1996, the same Pontiff visited the shrine on his second apostolic visit to Nicaragua. The same Pontiff raised the sanctuary of El Viejo to the status of Minor Basilica on 20 December 1995. Acta Apostolicae Sedis, LXXXVIII (1996), p. 239 On 7 October 1996, the Episcopal Conference of Nicaragua conferred the title \\"The National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception of El Viejo\\"; and on 13 May 2001, the Episcopal Bishops' Conference of Nicaragua declared the Virgin Mary under this title be the National Patroness of the country. On 4 August 2012, Pope Benedict XVI sent the image a golden pearl rosary in recognition of the piety of the Nicaraguan people's. That same year, Nicaragua celebrated the 450th annual patronage of the Immaculate Conception with grand parades and national festivities. A popular custom (especially among children) in Nicaragua during this time is to gather in a group and sing several Marian hymns in front of people's houses where a statue of the Immaculate Conception is enshrined. Similar to caroling songs during Christmas time, children receive special candies or sweet treats given by the household after the conclusion of singing Marian hymns. In Leon, Nicaragua, the feast is begun by a special day of penitence conducted each December 6, when the faithful take part in publicly cleaning all the silver treasures and accessories donated to the statue. The event is also celebrated with a tradition called Gritería or \\"Shouting\\" in honor of the Virgin Mary's conception and is composed of grand parades, fireworks, candlelight processions, songs and various religious activities related to the conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary and her maternal role in Roman Catholicism. Similar practices are observed in various other Catholic countries. =Portugal= ' — The shrine of the Immaculate Conception, consisting of Madonna and Child as Patroness of Portugal. By royal decree under the House of Braganza, the Immaculate Conception is the Patroness of Portugal. An image of the Immaculate Conception venerated in the Shrine of Our Lady of Conception of Villa Vicosa was donated by Saint Nuno Álvares Pereira. On 25 March 1646, King John IV of Portugal proclaimed Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception the nation's patroness, so that 8 December is a special feast day in Portugal. Upon crowning the image since that time, the Portuguese monarchs of the House of Braganza renounced wearing a crown on their heads. In addition, the king minted both gold and silver coins bearing his seal while on the other side bears the Immaculate Conception with the Latin phrase titled Tutelaris Regni. In 1946, at the 300th anniversary of this royal declaration, the government of Portugal also released a postal stamp commemorating its patronage featuring the image of the Virgin Mary. The first document invoking the Marian patronage is found the king's address to the National Royal Chambers dated 30 June 1654Para que seja mais notória a obrigação que eu e todos meus vassalos temos de defender que a Virgem Senhora Nossa foi concebida sem pecado original, houve por bem resolver que em todas as portas e entradas das cidades, vilas e lugares de meus Reinos se ponha, em uma pedra lavrada, a inscrição de que será cópia esta carta: Encomendo-vos a façais pôr nas portas e lugares dessa cidade (ou vila) e me aviseis de como o tendes executado. and was next followed again in the Royal Provision of 1646.\\"Estando ora juntos em Cortes com os três Estados do Reino lhes fiz propor a obrigação que tínhamos de renovar e continuar esta promessa (de D. Afonso Henriques) e venerar com muito particular afecto e solenidade a festa de Sua Imaculada Conceição: E nelas com parecer de todos, assentámos de tomar por padroeira de Nossos Reinos e Senhorios a Santíssima Virgem Nossa Senhora da Conceição... e lhe ofereço de novo em meu nome e do Príncipe D. Teodósio meu sobre todos muito amado e prezado filho e de todos os meus descendentes, sucessores, Reinos, Senhorios e Vassalos à sua Santa Casa da Conceição sita em Vila Viçosa, por ser a primeira que houve em Espanha desta invocação, cinquenta escudos de ouro em cada um ano em sinal de Tributo e Vassalagem: E da mesma maneira prometemos e juramos com o Príncipe e Estados de confessar e defender sempre (até dar a vida sendo necessário) que a Virgem Maria Mãe de Deus foi concebida sem pecado original\\" The statue's design is unlike most Immaculate Conception images, as the Virgin Mary carries a child Jesus rather than portrayed as being raised into Heaven. On 6 February 1818, the Order of the Immaculate Conception of Vila Viçosa was erected in the Virgin Mary's patronal honor by King John VI of Portugal. The feast marks one of the four national holidays in the Portugal.

The synthesis of phosphatidylcholines with specific fatty acids occurs through the synthesis of 1-lysoPC. The formation of various other lipids generates 1-lysoPC as a by-product.

Starting from either 1-lysoPC or 2-lysoPC, an equilibrium mixture of 90% 2-lysoPC and 10% 1-lysoPC is obtained with a half-time of about 10 minutes under physiological conditions and about 1 hour under typical laboratory conditions. Thus, unless special care is taken to slow this isomerization reaction, characterization of either of these lipids using laboratory assays that take a significant amount of time is likely to produce results on a mixture of the two lipids. In the fungus 'Penicillium notatum, an enzyme called lysolecithin acylmutase has been reported that can catalyze this isomerization reaction at low pHs at which the uncatalyzed reaction occurs very slowly.  Metabolic reactions Because 1-lysoPC has a relatively short half-life (see above), it is primarily a metabolic intermediate or side- product in the formation or breakdown of other lipids. =As product of reactions = 1-LysoPC can be produced from phosphatidylcholine by enzymes having phospholipase A1 activity, that is, enzymes hydrolyzing specifically at the sn-1 position of a phospholipid and releasing a fatty acid. Enzymes having phospholipase B activity hydrolyze both the sn-1 and sn-2 positions, so they produce both 1-lysoPC and 2-lysoPC. In humans, a number of enzymes with phospholipase A1 exist: they include two from the brain (with different optimal pHs), two from the liver (one cytosomal and one membrane-bound) and one from the mitochondrion. 1-LysoPC can be produced as a by-product of the reaction transferring an acyl group from a phosphatidylcholine to an acceptor molecule, resulting in the formation of an esterified acceptor molecule. In the human, an example of such a transacylation reaction is that catalyzed by the enzyme LRAT that converts an all-trans retinol to an all-trans-retinyl ester. The latter is a storage form of Vitamin A in various tissues, as well as a visual pigment precursor in the retina (see visual cycle). 1-LysoPC is also a by-product of the reaction in which N-arachidonoyl-1,2-diacyl-glycerol 3-phosphoethanolamine (NAPE) is produced. This is a rate-limiting step for the synthesis of anandamide and related signaling lipids. Two enzymes are known to catalyze this reaction. LRAT-like protein (RLP-1; a product of the gene HRASLS5), catalyzes transfer of an acyl group from phosphatidylcholine (PC) to phosphatidylethanol (PE), resulting in the formation of radioactive NAPE. RLP-1 does not show selectivity with respect to the sn-1 and sn-2 positions of PC as an acyl donor and therefore can generate N-arachidonoyl-PE (an anandamide precursor) from 2-arachidonoyl-PC and PE. There is also a Ca2+-dependent, membrane-associated enzyme (whose gene is currently not known) that is specific for the sn-1-acyl group of PC. =As substrate of reactions= 1-lysoPC can be hydrolyzed further by lysophospholipases to lose the remaining fatty acid and yield L-1-glycero-3-phosphocholine. In humans, 1-lysoPC can be hydrolyzed by ten different enzymes: calcium-independent phospholipase A2-gamma (coded by the gene PNPLA8), neuropathy target esterase (PNPLA6), lysophospholipase (PLB1), eosinophil lysophospholipase (CLC), galactoside-binding soluble lectin 13 (LGALS13), Group XV phospholipase A2 (PLA2G15), acyl-protein thioesterase 1 (LYPLA1), lysophospholipase (PLA2G4A), acyl-protein thioesterase 2 (LYPLA2) and PNPLA7 (Some of these enzymes also have phospholipase A2 activity). Other organisms have different numbers of enzymes that catalyze the same chemical reaction. For example the bacterium E. coli has only the gene products of tesA and pldB, while the yeast S. cerevisiae has the gene products of NTE1, PLB2, PLB1 and PLB3. There appear to be at least two enzymes that can produce a phosphatidylcholine molecule from 1-lysoPC. 2-acylglycerophosphocholine O-acyltransferase, an enzyme purified in liver microsomes, catalyzes specifically the acylation of 1-lysoPC with acyl- CoA to create a phosphatidylcholine molecule. This reaction is important for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine containing specific fatty acids, but are not used for the de-novo synthesis of phosphatidylcholine. In contrast to these finding from rat liver microsomes, mammalian acyl transferase from dog lungs was found to exhibit no preference between 1-lyso-2-acyl- phosphatidylcholine and 1-acyl-2-lyso-phosphatidylcholine. These differences have been attributed to the remodeling of membrane phospholipids in order to regulate membrane fluidity and the accumulation of physiologically important fatty acids such as arachidonic acid. In humans, triglyceride synthesis occurs through the Kennedy pathway, in which glycerol-3-phosphate is sequentially acylated to produce triacylglycerol. In plants and fungi, however, triacylglycerol synthesis can be catalyzed by phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (PDAT). Thus, diacylglycerol is the acceptor of a fatty acid coming from phosphatidylcholine, resulting in the release of a 1-lysoPC. A rat enzyme was found to transfer the acyl group from 2-lysoPC to 1-lysoPC, producing phosphatidylcholine. Transport systems In the human body, 1-lysoPC that is made in the liver is carried by albumin in the blood plasma to various tissues where it is acylated to produce PC molecules with specific acyl groups. In the liver, 1-lysoPC is released by phospholipase A1 and is also formed by hepatic lipase. Albumin-bound 1-lysoPC is an important pathway to access tissue compartments such as the brain, which take up few lipoproteins. Fatty acyl chains delivered by this route can then be acylated into tissue membrane phospholipids. In the human body, lysoPC (1-lysoPC and 2-lysoPC together) represent 5-20% of all phospholipids in the blood plasma. Taking care to control for the chemical isomerization between 1-lysoPC and 2-lysoPC (see above), about half of the lysoPC molecules in plasma have been shown to be in the 1-lysoPC form. Most (~60%) of the lysoPC is bound to albumin, and the rest is associated with lipoproteins. Of the total (free and esterified form) fatty acids carried by albumin, about one third is in the form of lysoPC. In addition to transport across tissues in the body, there are transport systems within cells to transport 1-lysoPC from where it is synthesized, or where it is delivered from other tissues, to where it is needed. Most organisms have transfer proteins (type IV ATPases) to transport phospholipid across their cell membranes. These proteins are likely to transport 1-lysoPC as well but their substrate specificities have not been established yet. E. coli and other bacteria have such a transporter protein that is a specialized lysophospholipid transporter (the LplT gene product). It can \\"flip\\" 1-lysoPC and the related compound 2-acylglycerophosphoethanolamine from the outer leaflet of the lipid bilayer to inner layer. Synthesis in the laboratory In the laboratory, a method to prepare relatively pure 1-lysoPC and purify away the reaction side-products is available.

This piece tells of the many a funny prank being played by the Crowley's Crew, (workers who appear in other writings of the time), and mentioning (fictitious) characters like Knack-kneed Mat, Slavering Nell, Gyetside Jack, and Willayton Dan. It turns into (almost) a celebration of Crowley's Crew.  Lyrics  The song was later printed in 1840 and later in 1899 in the 198-page book \\"Songs and Ballads of Northern England\\" collected and edited by John Stokoe. It was published by W. Scott of Newcastle upon Tyne. The lyrics for \\"Swalwell Hopping Air – Paddy's Wedding\\": = History of the Hopping= The word \\"Hopping\\" meant \\"a fair\\" in Anglo-Saxon and \\"a dance\\" in middle English, and it is from this that it developed. Mainly in the North East of England, it changed from a small local village meeting with dancing, into a large annual funfair. These have changed over the years from ornate, carved and highly decorated small roundabouts to the larger attractions. The Swalwell Hopping has its traditional way back in history. It was held annually at Whitsuntide and developed into a carnival of sports and horse racing before turning into the funfair. It was held for a time near the town gate at the waterside, and later moved to a more permanent home on the ground at the rear of Ridley Gardens (known locally as the Hopping Field. One of, if not the, largest employers in the 19th century were the ironworks of Crowley and Co. at Swalwell and Winlaton. The workers were proud craftsmen. They allegedly could make anything \\"ftev a needle tiv an anchor\\". They were also political radicals, who worked hard in unpleasant conditions, and played hard. The workers, often referred to as \\"Crowley's Crew\\", together with the local keelmen, were always to be seen at the hoppings in the 18th and 19th centuries. According to the song, they all enjoyed themselves, and possibly became rather too boisterous. In the 1950s, it was reported that at the annual Swalwell Hopping were \\"fairground rides such as the waltzer and carousel merry-go-round with traditional animal mounts, barley twist poles and fairy lights, a coconut shy, hoop-la stalls, a rifle range and other stalls where you could win various prizes, including a goldfish if you could throw a table tennis ball into one of many goldfish bowls. Many tickets were issued to schoolchildren giving half price rides for threepence and popular records of the day were amplified and played all evening\\" The various changes in life style sounded the death knell of the Swalwell in the 1960s. The \\"Hopping Field\\" is now a housing estate. = Places mentioned = *Swalwell was a village. It is now part of Newcastle upon Tyne *Winlaton was a village in County Durham but is now part of Gateshead *Whickham was a village in County Durham but is now part of Gateshead *Newcassel is Newcastle upon Tyne *Gyetside is Gateshead = Trades mentioned = Keelman were the dockers of yesteryear, who worked on the keels (or keelboats) of the River Tyne. Many, in fact the majority, resided as a close-knit community with their families in the Sandgate area, to the east of the city and beside the river. Their work included working on the keels/keelboats which were used to transfer coal from the river banks to the waiting colliers, for transport to various destinations including London.  Comments on variations to the above version  There are various published versions of the song, and some seem to have difficulties in following the original Geordie dialect. Here are some of the variations : *\\"wor\\" is written in some versions as \\"wour\\" *\\"Hopping\\" is spelt variously as \\"Hoppen'\\" or \\"Hoppin'\\", with or without the final apostrophe *\\" aw\\" is often written as \\"a'\\" *\\"frae\\" may be written \\"fra\\" *\\"se\\" is often written as \\"sae\\" *\\"awd\\" may be written \\"aud\\" *Verse 8 line 1 apparently refers to Joan Carr (or should that be John Carr)? *Verse 9 line 6 \\"sic\\" is often written \\"sec\\" *Verse 9 line 7 \\"wheit\\" has the meaning \\"quite\\" *Other definitions and meanings can be found in Geordie dialect words See also Geordie dialect words References  External links  *Swalwell Hoppings from Swalwell Online Category:English folk songs Category:Songs related to Newcastle upon Tyne Category:1800s songs Category:Northumbrian folklore ","title":"Swalwell Hopping"},{"id":"34471179","text":"Josip Torbar (1824–1900) was a Croatian natural scientist, educator and politician.
