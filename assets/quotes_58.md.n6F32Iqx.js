He was once known as \\"the Prince of Shipowners\\". Early life His father (also William) was partner in the firm of shipbrokers called Imrie & Tomlinson, based in Rumford Street, Liverpool. William Imrie went on to work for this firm which also took into its employment Thomas Ismay who was the son of Joseph Ismay, at this time a shipbuilder and timber merchant. White Star Shipping Line In 1869 Thomas Ismay was in business by himself running ships to Australia. At a dinner in Broughton Hall, West Derby, Ismay and Imrie decided they would form a partnership. When Imrie's father died in 1870 the Imrie & Tomlinson business was transferred to TH Ismay and Company. This joint venture was to be called Ismay, Imrie and Company and was the parent company of the Oceanic Steam Navigation Company Ltd which was the White Star Line's official name. On 27 August 1870 the White Star Line was to launch the RMS Oceanic the first of four new steamships which were built by the Belfast Shipbuilding company, Harland and Wolff. Family In 1872 William Imrie and his wife Hannah adopted the daughter of William Pollard. Amy Elizabeth Rosalie Pollard (to become better known as Amy Elizabeth Imrie) was in 1910 to become responsible for funding of the building of St Mary of the Angel's Church in Fox Street, Liverpool. Amy went on to enter the Convent of Poor Clares at Hertford, an order of nuns dedicated to the memory of St Francis. Amy also gave the family home in Mossley Hill to the Poor Clares to become their first convent in Liverpool. Properties Imrie's family property was originally The Hermitage in Hayman's Green, West Derby Village. In later years as he excelled in business he moved into the even grander Holmstead in Mossley Hill, a house which contained many fine examples of art including paintings by Strudwick from whom Imrie was a patron. Religion and philanthropy Imrie was a deeply religious person. He financially backed St Margaret's Church on Princes Road and numerous charities around the city which he supported anonymously. He gave financial support to the Seaman's Orphanage in Newsham Park. Death Imrie died in 1906. A service was held at St Margaret's Church and his body was laid with that of his wife in the family plot in the graveyard of St Nicholas Church in Halewood.

Integrated care may be seen as a response to the fragmented delivery of health and social services being an acknowledged problem in many health systems.Kodner, DL & Spreeuwenberg, C (2002): Integrated care: meaning, logic, applications, and implications ‚Äì a discussion paper. International Journal of Integrated Care , Vol. 2, 14. Nov. 2002 Integrated care covers a complex and comprehensive field, and there are many different approaches to and definitions of the concept. WHO gives the following definition: \\"Integrated care is a concept bringing together inputs, delivery, management and organization of services related to diagnosis, treatment, care, rehabilitation and health promotion. Integration is a means to improve services in relation to access, quality, user satisfaction and efficiency.\\"Gr√∂ne, O & Garcia-Barbero, M (2002): Trends in Integrated Care ‚Äì Reflections on Conceptual Issues. World Health Organization, Copenhagen, 2002, EUR/02/5037864  Central concepts  The integrated care literature distinguishes between different ways and degrees of working together and three central terms in this respect are autonomy, co- ordination, and integration. While autonomy refers to the one end of a continuum with least co-operation, integration (the combination of parts into a working whole by overlapping services) refers to the end with most co- operation and co-ordination (the relation of parts) to a point in between. Distinction is also made between horizontal integration (linking similar levels of care like multiprofessional teams) and vertical integration (linking different levels of care like primary, secondary, and tertiary care). Continuity of care is closely related to integrated care and emphasizes the patient's perspective through the system of health and social services, providing valuable lessons for the integration of systems. Continuity of care is often subdivided into three components: * continuity of information (by shared records), * continuity across the secondary-primary care interface (discharge planning from specialist to generalist care), and * provider continuity (seeing the same professional each time, with value added if there is a therapeutic, trusting relationship). Integrated care seems particularly important to service provision to the elderly, as elderly patients often become chronically ill and subject to co-morbidities and so have a special need of continuous care. The NHS Long Term Plan, and many other documents advocating integration, claim that it will produce reductions in costs or emergency admissions to hospital but there is no convincing evidence to support this. Collaborative care Collaborative care is a related healthcare philosophy and movement that has many names, models, and definitions that often includes the provision of mental-health, behavioral- health and substance-use services in primary care. Common derivatives of the name collaborative care include integrated care, primary care behavioral health, integrated primary care, and shared care. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) published an overview of many different models as well as research that supports them.Butler M, Kane RL, McAlpine D, Kathol, RG, Fu SS, Hagedorn H, Wilt TJ. Integration of Mental Health/Substance Abuse and Primary Care No. 173 (Prepared by the Minnesota Evidence-based Practice Center under Contract No. 290-02-0009.) AHRQ Publication No. 09-E003. Rockville, MD. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. October 2008. These are the key features of collaborative care models: *Integration of mental health professionals in primary care medical settings *Close collaboration between mental health and medical/nursing providers *Focus on treating the whole person and whole family. There are various national associations committed to collaborative care such as the Collaborative Family Healthcare Association.  Contrast to merging roles  The proper integrating of care does not mean the merging of roles. It remains uneconomical to make a physician serve as a nurse. Besides, the opposite approach is strictly prohibited by accreditation and certification schemes. The mix of staff for the various roles is maintained to enable a profitable integration in caring.  Examples  *The United States Department of Veterans Affairs is the largest integrated care delivery system in the US. *Kaiser Permanente and the Mayo Clinic are the two largest private systems in the US. *Essential for the implementation of the integrated care programme is a framework that guides the process. In Ireland, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is implementing an integrated care programme according to a 10-Step Framework. This Framework is created along the recommendation of the WHO.

The Museum tells the story of the development of the Galton Valley canals and those who designed, built and worked on them. In 2009 it won the Silver award in the 'Best Small Visitor Attraction' at the Black Country Tourism Awards. In 2011 the Museum moved from premises on Brasshouse Lane Smethwick to the New Smethwick Pumping Station. Now based in the New Smethwick Pumping Station the Museum is opened regularly by Sandwell Museum Service and The Friends of Galton Valley. New Smethwick Pumping Station The New Smethwick Pumping Station is situated between the Birmingham Old and New Main Line Canals. It first opened in 1892 with the purpose of pumping water from the lower Birmingham New Main Line to the high Old Main Line Canal to replace the water lost from the higher level when boats went through the Smethwick locks. The station only had a short working life, closing in the mid 1920s due to reduced traffic on the canals. Apart from a short period during the Second World War the building sat empty until it was restored and opened as part of the Galton Valley Canal Heritage Centre in the late 1980.

Originally planned for the 1993 World Horticultural Exposition, it was erected only in 2001.  Predecessor  As early as for the 1939 German Horticultural Exposition an observation tower was planned. It was eventually erected in 1950 and dubbed Zaiser Tower after the company that donated it. At its tip, a radio transmitter was mounted. The Zaiser Tower was demolished in 1974 because the necessary funds for its renovation could not be raised.  Guiding Principle and Objectives  In 1985 the City of Stuttgart received the contract for the 1993 World Horticultural Exposition (Internationale Gartenbauausstellung, IGA). In order to offer visitors an overview over a major part of the grounds, an artificial elevation was necessary. The site on the Killesberg where the previous tower had been located seemed suitable. More difficult than finding a suitable location proved the search for an appropriate design. The tower should be delicate and fit into its surroundings. The ambitious objective was to prove that modern construction engineering can be environmentally friendly, even when the tower is high and features several large observation decks. Eventually, J√∂rg Schlaich suggested a cable net construction based on the model of cable net cooling towers for power plants.  Project History  The first plans were developed in 1986 and worked out in more detail until 1991. However, the Stuttgart city council stopped the project because the IGA management had exceeded their budget. Subsequently, the Versch√∂nerungsverein Stuttgart (Embellishing Society) was asked for support. This organization had experience with local development programs as well as with collecting donations. In 1998, long after the IGA was finished, they had raised enough funds to start building the tower, among others by offering sponsorships to companies as well as private persons in exchange for mounting their name plates on individual tower steps. The tower was inaugurated on July 17, 2001.  Design  Significant design elements of the tower are the central mast whose heel is hinged via a steel ball to the central foundation, and the steel cable net of triangular meshes. The net is tensioned between a circular concrete foundation and a pressure ring at an altitude of 33.5 meters which in turn is suspended from the mast head by cables. The four observation decks at 8, 16, 24, and 31 meters are hinged to the mast and at their circumference connected to the net by press fittings. The two spiral staircases, one for ascending, one for descending, are carried only by the cable net. For the suspension and the net cables open spiral cables with diameter of 18 mm resp. 24 mm were used, consisting of 37 resp. 61 strands of 2.6 mm diameter. Their tensile strength is 1.57 kN/mm¬≤. Due to their relative high strength they are less susceptible to press forces exerted by the fittings, e.g. for the observation decks. All cables and fittings are galvanized. In addition, all steel construction elements received a double paint coat. The hollow sections, i.e. the mast and the stair tubes, are galvanized on both their inner and outer surfaces.  Access  Access to the park and the tower is free of charge. For the tower, a voluntary contribution is asked for. Opening hours are from 7 a.m. until nightfall.

The baserris, with their gently sloping roofs and entrance portals, are highly characteristic of the region and form a vital part in traditional Basque societal structures.Madariaga, Nikola de Baserrietxea eta Eusko Etxegintza Errikoia Bizkaiko Aurrezki Kutxa: 1983 They are also seen to have played an important role in protecting the Basque languageGarate, G. 27.173 Atsotitzak Bilbao Bizkaia Kutxa Fundazioa: 1998 in periods of persecution by providing the language with a very dispersed but substantial speaker base. Origins and historical development The half-timbered baserri of Lizarralde in Bergara. This is a hiruarriko with the extension on the left of the main building. The term baserri is derived from the roots basa \\"wild\\" and herri \\"settlement\\"Trask, L. The History of Basque Routledge: 1997 and denotes a farmstead not located in a village or town. People who live on a baserri are referred to as baserritarrak (), a term which contrasts with kaletarrak () (street people), i.e., people who live in a town or city. The present-day term baserri in Basque has a fairly restricted meaning, denoting the building and its occupants, especially in the Gipuzkoan dialect. Originally, however, it denoted the building (still called in some places baserri-etxea 'baserri house'), its dwellers and the whole estate. The originally wide connotation of the term is related to the inherent ambiguity of the Basque word herri which can be translated as \\"land\\", \\"home\\", \\"people\\" or \\"settlement\\" depending on the context. In Spanish, mostly the term caser√≠o vasco is used but note that a caser√≠o may also denote an entire settlement in parts of the Spanish speaking world. In French, the term maison basque is commonly encountered, although this overlaps to some extent with the Basque concept of etxea (the house). Overall, they are almost non-existent in the flatter terrains of √Ålava and central and southern Navarre (Ager Vasconum). These areas went through a more thorough period of Romanisation, in which the ancient Roman fundi provided the grounds for the new small population clusters and villages that dotted the whole region at the turn of the first millennium, after Muslim raids stopped. They are often named after an old landowner, e.g. Barbarin, Andoin, Amatrain, etc. In Navarre, parts of √Ålava and parts of the Northern Basque Country, baserris often form rather spaced out settlements, but virtually never wall- to-wall to minimise fire risks. Baserris in Gipuzkoa and Biscay on the whole are solitary buildings, but generally within view of another baserri. A stone- built baserri in Gizaburuaga. The predecessor of the baserri was the farming community of the late Middle Ages in the hilly Atlantic area, who at one point had learnt and taken up sowing and harvesting (cf. the legend of San Martin Txiki). The families didn't live in baserri buildings as we know today, but in clusters of small wooden fragile shacks with room enough for the family, the cattle and the stored hay. However, the press house, granaries, pigsty and sheepfolds were located in separate buildings. At this stage, the baserri stands clearly for the whole community behind the economic unit. This period also saw the development of the linguistic counterpart to the baserri for religious matters, the baseliza or \\"wild church\\". During the 14th and 15th century, as the population began to grow, agricultural activity increased and so did the linking of agricultural activities and animal husbandry on a baserri, leading to an increase in the number of baserris. The late 15th and the 16th century are a period of peace among warring nobiliary factions after years of clashes, in which exactions and abuses on farmers had been rife, leading to a time of optimism and stability. The American and Andalusian conquest opened new opportunities, with small fortunes made by Basque venturers, which propelled the construction of baserris, thriving in the hundreds. Maize from the Americas substituted less productive millet, taking its Basque name arto. While private land ownership had been known if not widespread in the southern parts of √Ålava and Navarre since Roman times, most land further north was still common land in this period.Kasper, M. Baskische Geschichte Primus: 1997 Councils fostered the building activity with tax exemption on tree chopping for baserri construction, which enabled Basque farmers to develop swathes of common land into privately owned baserris. Several of these new baserris were named simply Etxeberria, \\"the new house\\". At this transitional stage, the baserri buildings consisted of timbered structures that are barely reminiscent of dwellings, made up often in oak from the surrounding forests. In fact, the central position in the house was occupied by the press, since cider was a very important economic activity for the family's economy. Then, families started to move in for the initially cider producing mill, cattle stall and granary, eventually complementing or even replacing its original function with the dwelling. A well-known example of this type of baserri is the Igartubeiti baserri (built 1530), now an interactive museum and exhibition space, hosting events related to cider making (e.g. txalaparta) and traditional rural life. The first stone farmhouses in Gipuzkoa (which entailed timber frames anyway) were built during the 15th century and brought admiration and envy from their neighbours. Only the richest farmers could permit themselves the luxury of building a house \\"de cal y canto\\" (\\"of lime and stone\\"), paying a team of stonemasons who dug out and worked the stone. Oakwood was, on the other had, cheap and available. The increased building activity led to some of the earliest recorded environmental laws concerning de- and reforestation, such as the law passed by the Batzar of Azkoitia in 1657 which forbade the cutting of young trees and required anyone felling a tree to plant two new trees in its place. The Baseliza (hermitage) of Iturriotz in Aia. In the Northern Basque Country these are often called borda, a term that originally referred to shepherding shelters. The extension, both structurally and terminologically, of the term to refer to a farmhouse rather than shelter occurred in the 17th and 18th century when further increases in the population led to the development of such summer pasture shelters into farmhouses. The 17th century is also the last period in which baserris with half-timbered fa√ßades were constructed. Later constructions are virtually all in solid stone (except for the central section above the recessed portal to avoid structural problems). From the 18th century onwards, the remaining half-timbered elements were replaced by using stone arches above the entrances. Significance The lintel stone above a baserri in Aria; note the lauburu on the bottom left and the sun symbol on the bottom right A baserri represents the core unit of traditional Basque society, as the ancestral home of a family. Traditionally, the household is administered by the etxekoandre (lady of the house) and the etxekojaun (master of the house), each with distinctly defined rights, roles and responsibilities. When the couple reaches a certain age upon which they wish to retire, the baserri is formally handed over to a child. Unusually, the parents were by tradition free to choose any child, male or female, firstborn or later born, to assume the role of etxekoandre or etxekojaun to ensure the child most suitable to the role would inherit the ancestral home. The crest stone above the Orbe baserri in Angiozar, Spain, displaying the coat of arms of the Marquessate of Valdespina The baserri under traditional law (the fueros) cannot be divided or inherited by more than one person. This is still the case in the Southern Basque Country but the introduction of the Napoleonic Code in France, under which such practices are illegal, greatly upset this tradition in the North. Although the Basques in the north chose to be \\"creative\\" with the new laws, it overall resulted in the breakup and ultimate financial ruin of many baserris. In practice the tradition of not breaking up baserris meant that the remaining children had to marry into another baserri, stay on the family baserri as unmarried employees or make their own way in the world (Iglesia o mar o casa real, \\"Church or sea or royal house\\"). As such, most baserris have a large stone-carved sign built into the front wall called armarriak (crest-stones) and a decorative lintel stone above the entrance called ate-buru or atalburu (door head). The lintel stone usually states who built the house and the year in which it was built. The armarria either states the name of the village or valley or the family's surname and is often in the style of a coat of arms, a sign of the universal gentry enjoyed in Biscay. The latter practice of displaying the surname is mostly found in the Southern Basque Country.Etxegoien, J. Orhipean Xamar: 1996 Both are often also carved with Basque symbols, many of them pre-Christian, such as the lauburu, animals, plants and mythical figures. Many Basque surnames stem from place-names and more especially from baserris. However, these surnames are deceptively older than the baserri-etxe, i.e. the baserri building, referring to the community and site preceding the building. A considerable number also have apple-presses and barrel storage facilities built into the structure of the baserri for the production of Basque cider. Structure Although different building styles exist with features specific to each region, most share a common core design. Most have three floors with stables within the building and a gently sloping roof, stone supporting walls and internal constructions made largely from wood. Basic types The baserri is designed to be modular in the sense that additional wings can be added onto the primary structure to allow the building to be extended if necessary. The core building is referred to as biarriko (\\"two stone one\\"), comprising two main supporting walls; a hiruharriko (\\"three stone one\\") with an extension on one side and a lauarriko (\\"four stone one\\") with two extensions, one on either side of the original building. Floorplan The floorplan is almost invariably rectangular, with a narrow end forming the fa√ßade. The fa√ßade usually has windows on all three floors and at least one large entrance, often two. The conventional floor distribution usually has: * The stables for cattle on the ground floor on one side of the building, the kitchen, washroom and sitting room on the other * Sleeping quarters on the first floor, usually above the stable to minimise the need for heating. On the outside, this floor often also has one or more balconies. * A large attic for storing produce and indoor activities requiring more space; this attic space is often open or partially open to the outside on the front of the house to ensure ventilation. Kitchen and ovens Labrit Extea in Itzalle with an external oven on the first floor. Indoors, the kitchen (sukalde in Basque) was the centre of activity and social interaction. Originally the fire was located in the centre of the kitchen (similar to Scottish blackhouses) with a wall-mounted iron rotatable arm but were eventually replaced by fireplaces built into the wall with a chimney. Although commonly encountered on the ground floor, it is not uncommon for kitchens to be located on the 1st floor. If this was the case in the colder regions of the Basque Country, the compulsory bread oven was built on a little balcony, with only the opening facing into the kitchen to minimise fire risks. In the more temperate regions, the bread oven was usually separate from the main baserri building. Roof Historically, the roofing material was wood shingles made from beechwood but today in most regions baserri have tiled roofs. The Basque surname Telletxea (\\"the tile house\\") is seen to stem from that era when terracotta tiles replaced the earlier shingled roofs and the first person to have a tiled roof being singled out for this fact. Wood-shingle roofs mainly survive in the mountainous parts of Navarre and Soule suffering from high snowfall, as wooden roofs allow for more steeply angled roofs which prevent buildup of snow. The eaves are characteristically large, in particular on the front fa√ßades, but usually much smaller or non-existent on the opposite side. To reduce wind resistance, the north-facing aspect of the roof is often built in a style called miru-buztana (kite tail) - essentially a hip-roof. Entrance portal and fa√ßade Ortzaize. Note also the lack of a recessed portal. On older baserris, the entrance portal can take up up to a third of the fa√ßade's surface, often requiring one or more supporting pillars. It almost invariably faces south-east (i.e. opposite to the weather side) and irrespective of the views. Along with the disappearance of half-timbered fa√ßades in the 18th Century, the portals which were originally built in wood gradually disappeared and were replaced by stone-built portals. The wood in half-timbered fa√ßades was traditionally stained red with a paint made from olive oil, ochre and ox blood, although today commercial paints are often used. The white between the timbers was achieved by painting the surface with lime plaster. The portal (ataria in Basque) had a central role in the everyday life of the baserritarras, being home to activities ranging from a wide variety of social activities to grinding flour and animal slaughtering. In areas where baserris grouped together in loose settlements, the portal was transformed into a large doorway, usually with a two-wing door which was also split horizontally. Granaries The granary in of the Ibarguren baserri in Markina-Xemein. Although on most baserris produce is stored inside the main building, some have stand-alone granaries called garai in Basque. These are small, wooden or stone-built structures on staddle stones and very reminiscent of such granaries in other parts of the world. Tower farmhouses The Aranguren baserri in Orozko, converted from a fortified tower. Some baserris seem to defy the normal definition of a baserri. In many cases, these are the result of the Juntas Generales of Biscay and Gipuzkoa ordering the tower houses (dorretxeak in Basque) razed following centuries of Basque partisan wars. Many were converted into non-military buildings, resulting in rather unusual baserris. Modern developments Traditionally, agricultural and pastoral activities formed the mainstay of the inhabitants of a baserri but due to recent economic and societal changes, agrotourism has also become a major activity on baserris. Traditions and superstitions A silver thistle on the door of the Igartubeiti baserri. Various cultural traditions and superstitions surround the baserri. One is the habit of fixing dried silver thistles (called eguzkilore or \\"sunflower\\" in Basque, not to be confused with sunflowers, called ekilore) to the doors of a baserri for good fortune. Folklore has it that certain unwelcome spirits such as laminas, witches or devils only operate at night and attaching this flower to the door would lead these beings to assume the sun was shining on the baserri and therefore stay away. By a similar extension of belief, they were also supposed to protect against lightning strikes and storm damage.

About 14 air miles (22 km) east-northeast of present-day Riggins in remote north central Idaho at an elevation of . It was settled as a mining camp in the winter of 1861. Almost concurrent with its settlement, Washington Territory established Idaho County on December 20, 1861 in anticipation of a gold rush that brought over 9,000 residents within the first year., The town quickly became the seat with the first district court taking place at Florence on 22 September 1862. While the rich placer gold fields in the Florence Basin brought thousands of prospectors and contributed to the establishment of Idaho Territory in 1863, the rush to Florence was short-lived as intensive mining depleted the richest ground. At the first census of Idaho Territory, only 575 residents remained. By the territorial census of 1864, the population dwindled further to 254 residents. Even in its decline, Florence continued as the county seat until 1 June 1869 when the territorial legislature moved the county seat to the Warren's Camp settlement of Washington. The town thrived again from 1895-1900, based more on lode mining. Then the town slowly faded away, having only ten inhabitants in 1940, and was totally abandoned sometime after 1951. Early discoveries and prosperity The discovery of gold around Pierce and Orofino in 1861 drew thousands of prospectors into the Clearwater River area of present-day north central Idaho, east of Lewiston.An Illustrated History of North Idaho Embracing Nez Perces, Idaho, Latah, Kootenai and Shoshone Counties, State of Idaho, Western Historical Publishing Co., CITY (1903). With all the best ground claimed, many newcomers began to look elsewhere. In late summer 1861, a party of men headed south toward a local divide between the Clearwater River drainage and the Salmon River watershed. At that time, much of that area was still part of the Nez Perce Indian Reservation. (A new treaty in June 1863 reset the reservation boundary.)Merrill D. Beal and Merle W. Wells, History of Idaho, Lewis Historical Publishing Company, Inc. New York (1959). Perhaps because of Indian protests, the party split at some point. A smaller band of five made their way into a high mountain basin about thirty miles (50 km) south of today's Grangeville. There, they found very rich placer gold along most of the nearby streams in August 1861. Despite mutual promises to keep the find quiet when they returned to Elk City for supplies, word quickly got out. The camp went briefly under the name of Millersburg, but a miners' meeting soon settled on Florence in November 1861. That was the name the town had when the Washington territorial legislature made it the seat of Idaho County on December 20, 1861. By the time winter took hold, the camp reportedly held nearly two thousand men.M. Alfreda Elsensohn, Eugene F. Hoy (ed.), Pioneer Days in Idaho County, Caxton Printers, Caldwell, Idaho (1951). Unfortunately, the winter of 1861-1862 \\"proved to be one of the coldest in the history of Idaho.\\" No one knows how many men died from the cold, but one newspaper writer had \\"no doubt that at least one hundred men have perished from the cold.\\" Survivors told horrific stories of near-starvation, frostbite, and widespread snow-blindness. As was common to many of those early placer mining districts, the richest days in Florence lasted only a couple years. About five years of steady, but lesser production followed. By around 1869, Chinese miners were working most of the claims in the region, whites having leased the properties or abandoned them. Probably not coincidentally, Florence lost its designation as county seat on June 1, 1869. The period of largely Chinese production lasted until about 1880, followed by a long stretch of minimal activity. Population history * 1864 census: 254 (222 men, 11 women, 21 children) * 1863 census: 575 Resurgence and decline The first quartz lodes in the Florence area might have been developed as early as 1863. Another followed around 1872-1875\\\\. However, the location of the Florence Basin in high, extremely rugged country made transportation especially difficult. Operators had to rely on hand mills, or very small stamp mills that could be broken down into manageable components for transport. In 1895, a new road was built to connect Florence to Mount Idaho. With better transport, investors took another look at the quartz mining possibilities in the region. They found enough rich ore to justify bringing in more milling capacity, which set off another boom. Optimistic owners even assembled a dredge to re-work the old placer fields. Early returns seemed to justify their hopes, but both the lode and placer booms were fairly short-lived. By around 1900-1905, those hopes had faded and the town had to depend upon small-scale, essentially individual operations after that. Even that had ended by around 1940, when the census recorded just ten people in Florence. In 1951, when Sister Alfreda Elsensohn published her history of Idaho County, the handful of Florence inhabitants no longer received local mail delivery. It's not clear when the last resident moved away (or passed on). Today, only a few building foundations and an overgrown cemetery remain. The Florence Basin is several miles west of the Gospel Hump Wilderness, which was designated a wilderness area in 1978. The basin is over 4,000 vertical feet (1,220 m) above the Salmon River, five air miles (8 km) north of its confluence with French Creek. After flowing westward across the state, the river turns north at Riggins; Florence is also twelve miles (20 km) east of the river as it nears Lucile (elev. ).

Accessed 14 March 2014 The plot is interspersed with Brennan's account of how she escapes, culminating in the final d√©nouement. The rest of the story is told in flashback. When Brennan has to recover the remains of a murdered elderly woman from a shallow grave in the midst of a freezing Quebec winter, she thinks she has the full set of 206 bones, but when she returns to her lab to analyze the remains, she discovers that certain crucial finger bones (that could confirm the identity of the victim) are not present. Brennan soon discovers that an accusation of incompetence has been made against her: an anonymous phone call to the father of a murder victim alleges that Brennan neglected to observe trauma resulting from a bullet wound in the bones of an aging Chicago heiress that were found in the Quebec countryside some months previously. Brennan and her on- again/off-again lover Detective Andrew Ryan set out to Chicago to attempt to clear her name, where, much to Brennan's annoyance, Ryan bonds with her estranged husband's Latvian family after his flight back to Montreal is delayed by the weather. The morale of the Montreal forensics team is poor, with the addition of a disruptive new recruit to the group, and the department head on extended sick leave. Two more elderly women are dead or missing, and Ryan suspects that the force may be dealing with a serial killer. In the process of solving the crime, Brennan also has to deal with an aggressive cat- hating neighbour and a cold case in Chicago involving a family link.

Having played 91 times for England, Spacey is considered one of the greatest English footballers of all time. She is currently Head of Girls and Women's football at Southampton F.C. and head coach of Southampton FC Women. Club career Spacey was prevented from participating in boys' football at school but joined British Oxygen's women's team at the age of 13 in 1979. She played for Friends of Fulham under the tutelage of Fred Brockwell and was reported to have signed for Italian club Roi Lazio as a 19-year‚Äìold in 1985. Spacey also played for HJK Helsinki in Finland. The Finnish move came about through Spacey's England teammate Louise Waller, who had played for HJK the previous summer. After playing in Friends of Fulham's 3‚Äì2 WFA Cup final defeat to Leasowe Pacific at Old Trafford in April 1989, Spacey flew out to Helsinki with Waller and remained until September. Spacey then returned to England and scored 12 goals in the first five games of the 1991‚Äì92 season for her old club, who became known as Wimbledon Ladies in 1991. Spacey then spent eight seasons with Arsenal from 1993, before moving to Fulham on a professional contract in the 2002 close season. She had missed the second part of 1995‚Äì96 due to pregnancy. In her final season with Arsenal she was the leading goalscorer and FA Players' Player of the Year, also winning a Sport Relief special achievement award. Throughout her Arsenal career Spacey had enjoyed great success as a deep‚Äìlying forward player, helping The Gunners win numerous trophies. Vic Akers said of Spacey's career in 2009: In 2002‚Äì03 Spacey won a domestic treble with Fulham. International career Spacey made her debut for England against Belgium on 20 August 1984. She played in all four of England's games at their first FIFA Women's World Cup appearance in 1995. Having finished playing for England with a respectable 76 appearances, Spacey was later recalled by Hope Powell to add experience in midfield. Spacey was surprised by the development: \\"I honestly thought that wouldn't happen again. When I got the letter my legs went weak. I've played 76 times for England and now I feel like the new girl!\\" She went on to play a total of 91 times for her country, scoring 28 goals before retiring after UEFA Women's Euro 2001, aged 36. Among Spacey's achievements with England were two Mundialito tournament wins in 1985 and 1988. She scored twice in the 1985 final against hosts Italy as England won 3‚Äì2 in Caorle. In May 1990 Spacey scored at Wembley Stadium in an exhibition match played against Scotland. The following April she scored a hat-trick against the same opposition in a 5‚Äì0 friendly win at Adams Park in Wycombe. When The Football Association (FA) took over running the national team in 1993, Spacey plundered four goals in the first game that September, a 10‚Äì0 win over Slovenia in Ljubljana.  Coaching career  Spacey has a UEFA Pro Licence. She became manager of Fulham Ladies when they reverted to semi‚Äìpro status in 2003, but left in 2006 after Fulham scrapped their women's team altogether. Later that year she became a senior coach for AFC Wimbledon Ladies. Spacey later coached the England Under‚Äì16, Under‚Äì17 and Under‚Äì19 teams as well as working in the coaching departments of Arsenal and Charlton Athletic. In November 2006 she was appointed girls and women's football development officer for the Worcestershire FA. In December 2013, Spacey was appointed assistant to England women's manager Mark Sampson. She was part of Mark Sampson's coaching staff when the Lionesses came third at the FIFA Women's World Cup in Canada in 2015. In 2017, with Spacey as head coach, the England under-23 team won the Nordic tournament in Sweden, beating Norway 2‚Äì0 in the final match. In July 2018, Southampton F.C. announced that Spacey would be joining as the head of girls and women's football technical department, based at the Staplewood Campus full-time and also overseeing the club's Regional Talent Club. The club said her appointment was intended to help their women's team's \\"future goal\\" of playing in the FA Women's Championship. Their initial bid, to join the inaugural Championship, was rejected by The FA. In her first season as head coach of the senior women's team, who play in the FA Women's National League, Division One South West, the team completed the double, winning the league title (with a perfect 18 wins from 18 games) and League Cup.  Honours  Spacey was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2009. She was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2016 Birthday Honours for services to football.

(Chicago) 22 May 2008: FL07 Early life A native of Chicago, Illinois, Sam DeCero became interested in professional wrestling at an early age and remained a fan throughout his childhood. He often attended live wrestling events with his parents at the International Amphitheater where he watched the Vachon Brothers (Mad Dog & Butcher Vachon), Hercules Cortez, The Crusher, Dick the Bruiser and other stars of the era. He became interested in music as a teenager and played the kettle drum in his school marching band. At age 16, while still in high school, DeCero joined a heavy metal band. Though achieving some limited success, he eventually left the band after six years. Professional wrestling career Early career DeCero approached promoter Paul Krusky after attending a local wrestling show and asked about entering professional wrestling. He was initially turned away by Krusky who told the 22-year-old DeCero he was far too small to compete. DeCero began training and, within three months, he had increased his weight from 165 to 200 lbs. greatly improving his overall muscle mass. He later described his diet and training regimen in a 1991 interview, Krusky agreed to take him into the business and, after paying him a fee, DeCero was introduced to a facility in Louisville, Kentucky where he was trained by Paul Christy and Randy Savage, as well as his brother Lanny and father Angelo Poffo, for eight months before making his debut in 1981. Throughout his training, he drove 14 hours to and from Louisville each weekend, helped set up the ring and participated in wrestling matches for which he was paid $10. This story has always been subject to question, especially as DeCero's mom Kay would regale the Windy City roster with stories of how he would come home from training with Angelo Poffo at his home in Downers Grove and demonsrate some new hold or move he learned that night. From there, he spent his rookie year in Indianapolis for the World Wrestling Association as Slammin' Sammy Darro. One of his first matches was against one of his childhood heroes Dick the Bruiser. The Maxx Brothers While wrestling in the WWA, DeCero met his future tag team partner Mad Maxx and, changing his name to Super Maxx, they eventually began teaming together. After winning the WWA World Tag Team Championship from Dick the Bruiser & Jeff Van Kamp in 1984, they moved on to the American Wrestling Association where they became one of its top tag teams during the mid-1980s. Some of their highlight matches were against teams such as The Midnight Rockers (Marty Jannetty & Shawn Michaels) and AWA Tag Team Champions Curt Hennig & Scott Hall whom they faced in Hammond, Indiana on March 22, 1986. He and Mad Maxx also went on several tours of Japan where they earned as much as $3,000 a week and, while in World Japan Pro Wrestling, faced IWGP Tag Team Champions Tatsumi Fujinami & Kengo Kimura in a no disqualification match for the IWGP Tag Team Championship. DeCero praised the Japanese and described his experiences overseas in an interview years later. Throughout his career, he wrestled many of the top stars in the Midwest and Central States territories including Bruiser Brody, Adrian Adonis, Dick Murdoch, Jesse Ventura, Mr. Saito and Nick Bockwinkel. Many of these wrestlers gained respect for DeCero, who frequently faced them in \\"stiff\\" matches, and has credited them for helping him during his early career. Windy City Wrestling During his wrestling career, DeCero also worked as a city construction worker in Chicago. While on the job in 1987, he fell off a truck and landed on a steel plate suffering a severe back injury. He underwent surgery which required an intervertebral disc to be removed and two spinal fusions. Although he would recover from his injuries, he was told by doctors that he would unable to return to wrestling. DeCero also required surgery to remove growths caused by steroid use. He decided to open his own promotion, Windy City Wrestling, and spent almost a year gathering the necessary capital from family and friends prior to its debut in 1988. Mike Gretchner was one of the biggest invests and later became the Windy City Wrestling's general manager. He also started a wrestling school, Windy City Professional Wrestling Academy, in South Side Chicago which trained hundreds of wrestlers during the next twenty years. In September 1988, the school was profiled by the Chicago Sun-Times as reporter Larry Weintraub took part in a 3-hour training session under Frank \\"The Tank\\" Melson, Tarzan and DeCero. DeCero later said that it was his intention to bring back the \\"blood-and-guts wrestling that people loved years ago in the (International) Amphitheatre\\" and to make Chicago the center of professional wrestling once more. The promotion became very successful during the next two years bringing in a number of territory stars such as Mad Maxx, \\"Mr. Electricity\\" Steven Regal, Dennis Condrey,\\"\`Lover Boy' Condrey revs up for slugfest at Amphitheatre\\".

Dangerously started their early careers. Windy City Wrestling also ran a weekly half-hour television show on Sportsvision, produced and directed by DeCero, and aired in five markets within three years. In October 1990, DeCero appeared with head trainer Sonny Rogers and WCW Heavyweight Champion Hurricane Smith as guests on The Doug Buffone Show. The show was taped at Ditka's Restaurant in Merrillville, Indiana, and also featured former Chicago Bears lineman Revie Sorey.\\"Ex-Bear Sorey, Pro Wrestlers At Ditka's.\\" Post-Tribune. (Indiana) 29 Oct. 1990: C1 By 1991, DeCero had promoted over 80 shows and helped organize fundraisers for Toys for Tots, Muscular Dystrophy and the Maryville City for Youth. One of his benefit shows with the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless was held at the International Amphitheater and was attended by 4,000 fans. DeCero and the promotion would also organize fundraisers for local fraternal police orders, booster clubs, and high schools. Much of DeCero's charity work, as well as the wrestling school, attracted considerable media attention from newspapers and magazines. Windy City Wrestling was, at one point, ranked the fifth largest promotion in the United States. With the end of the 1980s wrestling boom, DeCero was hopeful that his promotion would surpass the National Wrestling Alliance and the World Wrestling Federation. He cited both the general decline of the NWA and Hulk Hogan's departure from the WWF, as well as correctly predicting the close of Pacific Northwest Wrestling, as reasons for his promotion to become the top wrestling organization. It was also his opinion that fans had grown tired of sports entertainment and that Windy City Wrestling was one of the few, if not the only promotion, actively promoting traditional \\"family friendly\\" wrestling. Although financial setbacks and the decline of the territory system eventually forced DeCero to keep the promotion based in the general Chicago area, it was the only Midwestern regional promotion to survive into the 1990s. He was also able to feature former WWF stars such as Brian Knobs, Bob Backlund, Greg Valentine and King Kong Bundy as well as younger Extreme Championship Wrestling wrestlers Rob Van Dam and Sabu. His wrestling school also remained one of the top facilities in the region and whose students included Baltazar, Steve Boz, Terry Allen, Vic Capri, Trevor Blanchard, Jayson Reign, Mike Anthony, Ace Steel, Sosay, Kevin Quinn and Christopher Daniels. DeCero has also helped train referee Terry Hopper, female wrestler Sandra D and midget wrestler Puppet the Psycho Dwarf. In 1998, he had 70 students enrolled in his school. Several of his students have appeared as preliminary wrestlers at WWF house shows and televised events in the area. Around this time, he started a sister wrestling promotion, Urban America Pro Wrestling, which ran events in Chicago's inner city neighborhoods and featured African-American and minority wrestlers. Retirement In May 2008, DeCero announced at a WCPW show that he would be turning over the promotion to Ripper Manson. It was also at this show that he inducted the Windy City Dream Team (Lance Allen and Eddie Strong), Kevin Quinn, Frank \\"The Tank\\" Melson, K.C. Knight and \\"Iron\\" Mike Samson into the WCPW 2008 Hall of Fame. Head trainer Sonny Rogers and WCPW alumni Trevor Blanchard, Lips Manson, Zebra Kid and Christopher Daniels accompanied them to the ring. That same year, DeCero became involved in a kayfabe feud with new co-owner Billy Whack who promised to \\"contact everyone who DeCero may have ever crossed by non-payment, bad business deals or personal reasons\\" and \\"invited every wrestler in the Chicago wrestling scene to join him in doing the one thing that every person who has ever started a wrestling group in Chicago has always wanted to do - conquer Sam DeCero and his WCPW\\".\\"Weekend includes IWA Mid-South, WCPW events.\\" SouthtownStar. (Chicago) 13 Nov. 2008: FL11 Billy Whack had previously promoted Lunatic Wrestling Federation, formerly based in Mokena and Midlothian, Illinois, which had rivaled DeCero's organization in previous years.

She studied Natural Sciences at Durham University as a member of University College. She graduated in 2006 with double first class honours in Chemistry and Physics, later completing a doctorate in climatology. Career In 2008, she joined the Met Office soon becoming a Senior Climate Scientist, specialising in Climate Impacts and Disaster Risk Reduction. In 2010, she was seconded to London to advise the UK Government Department of Energy and Climate Change on policy matters relating to weather and climate, including renewable energy provision. On her return to the Met Office she worked as Private Secretary to the Met Office Chief Scientist Prof. Dame Julia Slingo and became the first to hold the post of Expert Scientist in Communications. In 2009, she established ExCite Poetry, the Devon arm of the UK Poetry Society. Within six months of its formation, ExCite Poetry became the largest regional arm of the Poetry Society by a significant margin with well over 200 members and was consequently the focus of the first of a series of poetry workshops with Ruth Padel on BBC Radio 4. Between 2009 and 2013, she co-hosted a monthly arts-review show on Phonic FM, hailed by The Sunday Times as \\"providing some of the most inspiring broadcasting in the country\\".

Biography  He displayed an early affinity for drawing and received his first art lessons from his father, who was a decorative painter.Brief Biography from the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary @ Russian WikiSource. At the age of sixteen, when his father died, he packed his bags and went to Saint Petersburg, hoping to enter the Imperial Academy of Arts. After failing to gain admission, he became an apprentice in the workshop of , a well known woodcutter. His talent drew the attention of the sculptor Pyotr Clodt, who arranged for him to audit classes at the Academy.Brief biography @ \\"Sunday Afternoon\\". In 1850, he was able to become a regular student, and worked with Alexey Markov. He graduated in 1853 and was awarded a stipend to study in Italy for his graduation painting, The Mother of God. The following year, he settled in Rome and established his own studio on Via Vittoria, near the Villa Borghese. He painted a wide variety of canvases, including landscapes, village scenes, genre scenes, historical works and, of course, portraits of the city's notable citizens. His health was poor, so he remained there after his stipend expired, to take advantage of the warm climate. He paid a long visit home from 1863 to 1865. While there, the Academy awarded him a professorship in history painting for his depiction of Horace reading his satires to Gaius Maecenas. He also came into contact with a group of dissident artists who would later be known as the Peredvizhniki; which inspired him to paint a series of genre works on peasant life. Later, he became a member of the group and regularly sent paintings from Italy to show in their exhibitions. He was awarded the Order of St. Anna as well as being named an Academician and an honorary member of the Academy. During this period he created one of his best known works: The Cursed Field (1878), an indictment of slavery. He died near Rome and was buried in the Protestant Cemetery. Despite having lived in Italy for most of his life, he left over 300 paintings and drawings and the equivalent of 400 Rubles to establish an art school in Shadrinsk. The school was not established until the Soviet period and the works were used as the basis for a museum.

It is known from the type species Aardonyx celestae found from the Lower Jurassic Elliot Formation of South Africa. A. celestae was named after Celeste Yates, who prepared much of the first known fossil material of the species. It has arm features that are intermediate between prosauropods and sauropods. Based on the structure of the hind limbs and pelvic girdle of Aardonyx, the dinosaur normally moved bipedally but could drop to quadrupedal movement similar to Iguanodon. It shares some attributes with giant quadrupedal sauropods like Apatosaurus.Associated Press (November 11, 2009). Scientists: New dinosaur species found in South AfricaNPR. Australian paleontologist Adam Yates and his team's discovery of the genus was published online before print in Proceedings of the Royal Society B in November 2009, and was scheduled to appear in the March 2010 issue. British paleontologist Paul Barrett of the Natural History Museum, London, who was not involved in the research, commented that the discovery of Aardonyx \\"helps to fill a marked gap in our knowledge of sauropod evolution, showing how a primarily two-legged animal could start to acquire the specific features necessary for a life spent on all-fours\\". According to Dr. Matthew Bonnan, a co-author on the study, \\"We already knew that the earliest sauropods and near- sauropods would be bipeds. What Aardonyx shows us, however, is that walking quadrupedally and bearing weight on the inside of the foot is a trend that started very early in these dinosaurs, much earlier than previously hypothesized.\\" Bonnan adds, \\"On a scientific level, it's really fulfilling to have a hypothesis on how you think dinosaurs got large, then to test that in the field and get back these kind of data ‚Äî a new dinosaur ‚Äî that really does start to fill in some of those anatomical gaps.\\" Description Aardonyx compared to a human in size The genus is known from disarticulated bones belonging to two immature individuals. The material consists of cranial elements, vertebrae, dorsal and cervical ribs, gastralia, chevrons, elements of the pectoral and pelvic girdles, and bones of the fore and hind limbs, manus, and pes. The presence of these bones in a single dense accumulation in a localized channel fill suggests that they came from relatively complete carcasses. Both individuals are thought to have been less than 10 years old at the time of their death because of the lack of peripheral rest lines in the cortices of sampled bones. Additional evidence for immaturity at the time of death includes calcified cartilage at the articular end of the scapula.

Many features of the skeleton support this relationship. These include derived traits seen in the vertebrae (such as hyposphenes that are as deep as the neural canal and mid-cervical neural spines that are less than twice as long as high) as well as the appendicular skeleton (such as the position of the fourth trochanter over the midlength of the femur and an adult femur length exceeding 600 mm). Paleobiology Feeding Aardonyx shows a transition toward the bulk-browsing form of feeding characteristic of sauropods. The jaws of Aardonyx are narrow and V-shaped with a pointed symphysis, a plesiomorphic characteristic shared with other basal sauropodomorphs. In sauropods, the jaws are broad and U-shaped to allow for a wider bite. The absence of a lateral ridge at the caudal end of the dentary is indicative of a loss of fleshy cheeks. This is seen as an adaptation for a wider gape to facilitate in bulk browsing, and is observed in nearly all sauropods. The lateral neurovascular foramina of the maxilla of Aardonyx are smaller than those of other basal sauropodomorphs, and indicate that there was a reduction in blood supply to the buccal tissues and thus a loss of fleshy cheeks. The development of lateral plates along the alveolar margins of some bones of the skull would have helped brace the lingual sides of the teeth against bucco-lingual forces during foliage stripping. The presence of plesiomorphic V-shaped jaws along with the absence of fleshy cheeks is an unusual characteristic of Aardonyx. Previously, it was thought that broader jaws evolved prior to the reduction and loss in fleshy cheeks as an adaptation toward bulk-browsing in sauropods. The sauropod Chinshakiangosaurus possessed jaws that were U-shaped, while still retaining fleshy cheeks, the opposite of the condition seen in Aardonyx. Because Chinshakiangosaurus is a more derived sauropodomorph, this suggests that a wide, cheekless gape may have evolved twice in Sauropodomorpha: once with Aardonyx and again with sauropods more advanced than Chinshakiangosaurus. Locomotion Restoration Characteristics of the limbs of Aardonyx suggest that it was habitually bipedal. Evidence for bipedalism can be seen in the forelimbs; the structure of the radius and ulna limited the degree to which the manus could be pronated, and the length of the humerus is only 72 percent that of the femur. However, characteristics found in both the fore and hind limbs of Aardonyx show a trend toward more habitual quadrupedalism that would eventually lead to the obligatory quadrupedalism seen in sauropods. The proximal end of the ulna possesses an incipient craniolateral process that gives the bone a y-shape similar to, although more subtle than, those of obligatory quadrupedal sauropodomorphs. The radius is shifted cranially, and a radial fossa allows for the ulna to cradle the radius craniolaterally. These characteristics suggest that there was a development towards greater quadrupedalism in Aardonyx. Although the hindlimbs of Aardonyx clearly show evidence for bipedalism (such as the retention of a convex proximal lateral profile of the femur and the position of the cranial trochanter far from the lateral margin of the femur), there is also evidence that indicates a shift toward quadrupedalism. Features of the femur suggests that the gait of Aardonyx was slower than that of more basal sauropodomorphs. The shaft of the femur is straighter and the fourth trochanter is more distally placed. The repositioning of the fourth trochanter to a more distal position causes the M. caudofemoralis longus muscle, the main femoral retractor muscle, to have greater leverage (more mechanical advantage) but conversely a decrease in the velocity of femoral retraction; consequently, Aardonyx was a powerful but slower walker than typical prosauropods. Another characteristic that suggests a slower gait in Aardonyx is the robustness of metatarsal I in comparison with those of other basal sauropodomorphs. This is evidence of a more medial, or entaxonic, position of the weight bearing axis of the foot, as opposed to a more mesaxonic position where the weight bearing axis runs through digit III. The development of entaxony in Aardonyx provides further evidence for its reduced cursorial ability and wider gauge-gait, which is thought to have preceded obligatory quadrupedalism in sauropodomorphs. Previously, it was thought that entaxony developed after the divergence of Vulcanodon due to the presence of mesaxony in the genus.Carrano, M. T. (2005). The evolution of sauropod locomotion: morphological diversity of a secondarily quadrupedal radiation. In Curry Rogers, K. A. and Wilson J. A. (eds.) The Sauropods: Evolution and Paleobiology, pp. 229‚Äì251. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press. However, the presence of mesaxony in Vulcanodon can be now considered an evolutionary reversal given the clear presence of entaxony in Aardonyx.

Original concept and design was written by William 'Bill' Tiller, who was also responsible for the visual look of the Monkey Island game, The Curse of Monkey Island. The game was released in November 2009 in Germany, throughout the rest of Europe on February 19, 2010, and finally in the United States on August 30, 2010 by German publisher dtp entertainment. The game is built on the open-source Panda3D game engine. Due to the game's tepid commercial success, Tiller has been thus far unable to secure financing for his envisioned sequel, Ghost Pirates and the Galleon of Doom. The team has nonetheless been able to crowdfund a small spinoff game, Duke Grabowski: Mighty Swashbuckler! Gameplay The gameplay follows standard point-and-click adventure games but with a twist. Having been cursed, the three protagonists are able to interact with the world as either themselves normally or leave their bodies and interact as ghosts. As ghosts, they are capable of moving through walls and manipulating things without being seen or heard by most characters. However, due to being ghosts, they are unfortunately unable to pass through or touch certain ghost warding barriers such as a line of salt. To pass, they thus have to find ways to clear the barriers away through other means. Along with the ghost mechanics, each individual character is equipped with a set of skills. In relation to the curse, they are also able to communicate with each other telepathically and able to use each other's body in order to solve certain puzzles that each one alone is incapable of solving. Papa Doc is a strong \\"Vooju\\" priest and is an expert in most Vooju related areas such as reading certain hieroglyphics. Jane Starling is a nimble pirate and is an expert in most pirate techniques such as forging papers. Blue Belly is fat little pirate and is an expert in cooking and other related matters. Plot The game follows the exploits of the game's three main protagonists, Papa Doc, Jane Starling, and Blue Belly, as they try to stop the resurrection of a demon god, which is orchestrated by Papa Doc's treacherous wife, the Vooju witch Queen Zimbi aided by the pirate crew of Greenbeard and an army of zombies. After she captures the pirate king Flint and knocks out the three protagonists, the three find themselves cursed with their souls separated from their bodies. In the first part of the game, the three protagonists have to find a way to reacquire their bodies, a method of reattaching their souls, and a ship in order to leave Vooju island and seek help. They have to do so before they are turned into zombies or before the cock crows thrice, otherwise they would be forever lost as ghosts. In the second part of the game, the three have to gather allies and stop Greenbeard's attempt to attack Blue Belly's home port with the aid of their ghostly powers. In the final part of the game, with their allies, the three heroes have to defeat Zimbi's evil mother Mama Malidei and stop the demon god's resurrection. Reception This game has received mixed reviews. GameRankings gave it a 69% based on 12 reviews, and Metacritic gave it a 66 out of 100 based on 14 reviews.

The product is an artificial fir tree that comes pre-wired and strung with lights, which cannot be removed and are usually embedded within the artificial branches. The product can be sold as a kit - the user assembles the tree and plugs it into an electrical outlet - or the dealer may assemble it before the sale. Prelit trees may have traditional mini bulb lights, LED lights, or fiber-optic lights. Larger trees usually contain traditional strands of bulb lights while smaller tabletop trees have fiber optic branches. Some more expensive trees come with energy-efficient LED lights. Prelit trees are being classified into the categories of electrical products. An example of a prelit tree with Christmas decorations. History The first lighted Christmas trees made use of candles. Attaching the candles was a difficult process, and proved to be a fire hazard. The tree could not be left unattended when the candles were lit. A bucket of water also had to be kept near the tree and someone had to keep watch for a possible fire. Candle wax was expensive, so later trees used lamps that were made from nutshell halves filled with oil and a wick. More elegant lamps were made from different colours of glass. The new candle holder, called a counterbalance candle holder, had a weight attached to the bottom that kept the candle standing upright. However, even with these improvements, the trees still proved to be fire hazards. The invention of the electric light added a new dimension to Christmas trees. In 1882 an inventor named Edward Hibberd Johnson working for Thomas Edison devised a way of wrapping small electric lights in red, white, and blue cr√™pe paper. These coloured lights that were strung on a tree provided the earliest version of contemporary Christmas lights. However, Christmas tree lights were still experimental throughout the 1880s. Miniature Christmas lights were first developed in 1895 by Ralph E. Morris, an employee of the New England Telephone Company. Morris‚Äô idea for miniature Christmas lights occurred as he was looking at the tiny bulbs on telephone switchboards. However, many Americans still distrusted the safety of electric lights throughout the early 1900s and candles were still used to illuminate trees. The early Christmas tree lights were simply night-lights strung together to form light strings. When General Electric commercially introduced Christmas lights, they quickly became popular. Edison Electric soon followed suit with an electric Christmas lamp. In the early 1990s the world's largest artificial Christmas tree maker, Boto Company (bankrupted in January 2008) started the first production of prelit trees supplied to Target stores. Recent technical advances in the manufacturing process of prelit trees has made them easy to assemble and realistic looking. Closeup of a mini light usually found on prelit trees Safety issues Shock and fire hazards The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is urging people to look for and eliminate potential dangers from holiday lights and decorations that could lead to fires and injuries. Each year, hospital emergency rooms treat about 1,300 people for injuries related to holiday lights and 6,200 people for injuries related to holiday decorations and Christmas trees. In addition, Christmas trees are involved in about 400 fires in the U.S. annually, resulting in 10 deaths, 80 injuries and an average of more than $15 million in property loss and damage each year. Most of those fire accidents were caused by real Christmas trees. With artificial trees, the risk of fire is lowered with new fire-resistant plastics. However, prelit trees do pose a higher fire hazard compared to artificial Christmas trees and there have been recalls in the past to safeguard the safety of consumers. The following are some of the major recalls: *U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission announced recalls by Target on 7' Artificial Pine Christmas Trees and accompanying extension cords in 1993 due to fire risk from the extension cords supplied with the lighted trees, which may overheat or melt. *Walgreens, of Deerfield, Ill., voluntarily recalled about 9,000 artificial Christmas trees with fiber optic lights in 2000. A colour wheel in the tree stand that is used to light the tree can overheat and catch fire. *In 2007 the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission ordered a recall of Prelit Palm Trees imported by iObjectSolutions Inc. for hazards of overheating and electrical shocks. If the electrical connectors were not fully inserted, they could overheat and pose electrical shocks and fire hazards. Toxic substances For prelit trees, the real threat of toxic substances are mainly the lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd) and chromium (Cr) associated with the lights attached on the trees. Safety standards All prelit trees are being classified into electrical products. They are subject to the laws and safety standards for electrical products such as UL in the United States, CSA in Canada, AS/NZS in Australia and New Zealand, GS in Germany, BS in the United Kingdom, and RoHS in the European Union. Storage Along with the safety issues, another issue for considering using prelit trees is storage considerations. Because the lights on a prelit Christmas tree are tied together it will be important to use the right method of storage for this type of tree. There are different options that Christmas tree companies offer for pre-lit Christmas tree storage. Many of these allow for the user to store the tree in a box while others offer bags for storage. It is also important to consider the height of the tree for storage. Using the box that the Christmas tree came in is by far the most common option that is used for handling a Christmas tree. This is because the box will be perfectly built to where it will be easier to move the tree around and to keep it properly secured. In many cases oversized boxes will be used for storage primarily so that the tree will be able to be stored properly during shipping. Many companies offer bags to be used for handling prelit trees. The bag can be strapped along a prelit tree. The tree branches are pulled upwards and the bag is placed under the tree. Using its handles, the bag is then pulled up over the tree, and the bag can be stored by hanging it from the handles.

The blackout affected an estimated 60 million people in Brazil.  Description  Thousands of passengers were stranded as metro trains came to a halt and buses failed to cope with the volume of passengers. There were widespread reports of road accidents as street lighting and traffic lights failed. The blackout began about 22:15 on Tuesday and lasted until about 02:45 on Wednesday in S√£o Paulo, although power was restored gradually in some places from before midnight.  Causes  Heavy rains and strong winds caused three transformers on a key high-voltage transmission line to short circuit, cutting the line and automatically causing the complete loss of 14 GW of power and the shutdown of the Itaipu Dam for the first time in its 25-year history. The power cut, which Brazilian officials said affected 18 of the country's 26 states, brought chaos to cities including S√£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, Campo Grande and Vit√≥ria. Media such as Slashdot and 60 Minutes reported that the outage was the work of hackers. However, in December, 2010, WikiLeaks released a US diplomatic cable which suggested otherwise. The cable also reported that it > represented a loss of 28,000 megawatts ‚Äì or 45 percent of total Brazilian > consumption at that instant ‚Äì of electricity and left an estimated 87 > million residents without power. Scrutiny has been intense and speculation > rife over the cause of the incident, in large part due to the recent > announcement of Rio as the host of the 2016 summer Olympics. and indicated that the longest outage was 6 hours, in S√£o Paulo, and details interim reports on what failures caused the outage, and responses under consideration. President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva arranged an emergency commission to enquire into the cause of the blackout. The blackout also unleashed a political stir as the Minister of Energy has been summoned to testify before Congress.  Affected regions   Paraguay  The Itaipu Dam is shared with Paraguay. In the immediate aftermath of its failure, interconnecting lines to Paraguay's other large powerplant, the Yacyreta Dam (in the border with Argentina), also failed.

Distance to horizon  R is the radius of the Earth, h is the height of the transmitter (exaggerated), d is the line of sight distance Assuming the Earth is a perfect sphere with no terrain irregularity, the line-of-sight distance to the horizon from a transmitter located at a given altitude above the surface can readily be calculated. Let R be the radius of Earth and h be the altitude of the transmitter's antenna. Line of sight distance d of this station is given by the Pythagorean theorem; : d^2=(R+h)^{2}-R^2= 2\\\\cdot R \\\\cdot h +h^2 Since the altitude of the station is much less than the radius of the Earth, : d \\\\approx \\\\sqrt{ 2\\\\cdot R \\\\cdot h} The mean radius of the earth is about . (See Earth radius) Using the same units for both the altitude of the station and the radius of the earth, : d \\\\approx \\\\sqrt{ 2\\\\cdot 6378 \\\\cdot h} \\\\approx 112.9 \\\\cdot \\\\sqrt{h} But the radius of Earth is given in kilometers. Converting the equation for distance in kilometers and height in meter, d_{km} \\\\approx \\\\sqrt{ 2\\\\cdot 6378_{km} \\\\cdot h_m} = \\\\sqrt{ 2\\\\cdot 6378_{km} \\\\cdot h_m \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1_{km}}{1000_m}}=\\\\sqrt{ \\\\frac{2\\\\cdot 6378}{1000}}(\\\\sqrt{h_m}) km where d_{km}is the distance in kilometers and h_mis in meters. Thus, if the height is given in m. and distance in km, : d \\\\approx 3.57 \\\\cdot \\\\sqrt{h} If the height is given in ft. and the distance in miles, : d \\\\approx 1.23 \\\\cdot \\\\sqrt{h} Of course the presence of hills or mountains between the transmitter and receiver may reduce this distance.  The actual service range  The above analysis doesn‚Äôt take the effect of atmosphere on the propagation path of the RF signals into consideration. In fact, the RF signals don‚Äôt propagate in straight lines. Because of the canalizing effects of atmospheric layers, the propagation paths are somewhat curved. Thus, the maximum service range of the station, is not equal to the line of sight distance. Usually a factor k is used in the equation above : d \\\\approx \\\\sqrt{2 \\\\cdot k \\\\cdot R \\\\cdot h} k > 1 means geometrically reduced bulge and a longer service range. On the other hand, k < 1 means a shorter service range. Experience has shown that, under normal weather conditions k is 4/3.R.Busi: Technical Monograph 3108-1967 High Altitude VHF and UHF Broadcasting Stations, European Broadcasting Union Brussels,1967 That means that, the maximum service range increases by 15%. :d \\\\approx \\\\sqrt{17h}\\\\approx 4.12 \\\\cdot \\\\sqrt{h} for h in m. and d in km. :d \\\\approx \\\\sqrt{2h}\\\\approx 1.41 \\\\cdot\\\\sqrt{h} for h in ft. and d in miles ; But in stormy weather, k may decrease to cause fading in transmission. (In extreme cases k can be less than 1.) That is equivalent to a hypothetical decrease in Earth radius and an increase of Earth bulge.This analysis is for high altitude to sea level reception. In microwave relay links, both stations are often located at high points in the terrain.  Example  In normal weather conditions, the service range of a transmitting station at an altitude of 1500 m. with respect to receivers at sea level can be found as, : d \\\\approx 4.12 \\\\cdot \\\\sqrt{1500} = 160 \\\\mbox { km.}  Earth bulge given a certain height  Let d be the distance in km from the observer to the maximum earth bulge, h be the height in m of earth bulge and k the bulging factor. The height of the earth bulge is which shows a dependency on the observer distance. This gives zero bulge at the location of the observers and maximum at its midpoint. To prove the equation, taking the equation for d with k budge factor, d \\\\approx \\\\sqrt{2 \\\\cdot k \\\\cdot R \\\\cdot h_m}=\\\\sqrt{2\\\\cdot 6378 \\\\cdot k\\\\cdot h_m}=\\\\sqrt{12.756 \\\\cdot k\\\\cdot h_{km}} Having d_1=d_2=dand h_1=h_2=h, h= \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{12.756 \\\\cdot k\\\\cdot h_{km}}\\\\sqrt{12.756 \\\\cdot k\\\\cdot h_{km}}}{12.75k}=\\\\frac{12.756 \\\\cdot k\\\\cdot h_{km}}{12.75k}\\\\therefore=h  See also  *Radial (radio) *Transmitter *Field strength in free space *Line-of-sight propagation  References and notes   External links  *https://web.archive.org/web/20090614175605/http://www.wireless- center.net/Cisco-Wireless-Networking/728.html *https://web.archive.org/web/20091014220530/http://web.telia.com/~u85920178/data/pathlos.htm#bulges *http://www.scribd.com/doc/52528816/64/The-Earth-bulge Category:Radio frequency propagation Category:Broadcast engineering ","title":"Earth bulge"},{"id":"25044522","text":"Yordan Todorov ‚Äì Paro (; born 12 November 1981) is a Bulgarian footballer, who plays as a midfielder for Kom.

She scored 30 with the bat playing at number four, and claimed the wicket of Mollie Hunt in the second-innings. In a match that England won by 120 runs, she could only manage one run as South Africa chased 153 in their second-innings.

It opened in 1956 as the Holiday, closed in 1998, and reopened as Siena in 2001. It uses the Renaissance Hotels brand under license from Marriott International. History Holiday (1956‚Äì1998) Holiday opened in 1956 as a non-gaming hotel. Within a year of its opening, poor performance resulted in the addition of gaming. At the end of October 1998, after 42 years in business, Holiday closed. Shortly after the old Holiday closed, it was purchased by California investor Barney Ng, who planned to remodel the old building by completely gutting the structure and then rebuilding and expanding on it, at a cost of US$16-$20 million, transforming the structure and adding an all suite floor, an additional wing to the tower, a larger casino, dining venues, a large spa, and an entrance with a clock tower. Siena (2001‚Äì2017) The hotel opened on July 31, 2001 with 500 employees. After years of financial struggle, Siena was closed on October 21, 2010. It was decided by creditors to auction the hotel off and that was done on November 10, 2010. A group of investors from various locations around the country including Reno with hospitality experience called \\"Grand Siena, LLC\\" purchased the property for $3.9 million. Siena Reno logo (2011‚Äì2015) Grand Siena, LLC invested $5 million into refurbishing Siena Reno, including remodeled rooms, a redesigned casino, new restaurants and entertainment venues and a revamped spa. They claimed the hotel was positioned to rank as a 4 or 5 diamond resort. The newly revamped Siena opened on April 18, 2011. The new owners of the boutique resort say they have replaced much of the old Italian theme with an aggressive-contemporary theme using much marble, LED lighting, and imported artwork. They say the new facility will cater to a more mature audience with less emphasis on loud nightlife. Siena Reno logo (2015‚Äì2017) In May 2015, Grand Siena, LLC agreed to sell the Siena. The casino closed on June 30, 2015, the day before the sale was completed. Months later, the ownership group, led by developer Fernando Leal, announced that the Siena would be rebranded as a Renaissance Hotel, and confirmed that the casino would not reopen. Renaissance by Marriott (2017‚Äìpresent) In 2017, renovations were completed and the rebranding as a Renaissance Hotel took effect.

Archaeology In 1972 a cast bronze clasp was found at Hampton Gay near St Giles' parish church. It is decorated with stylised Acanthus leaves and may be late Saxon, from the 10th or 11th century. Manor After the Norman Conquest of England Robert D'Oyly gave an estate of three hides at Hampton Gay to his brother in arms Roger d'Ivry, while a second estate of two hides at Hampton Gay belonged to the Crown. D'Ivry's holding became part of the honour of St. Valery, which in the 13th century was owned by Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall. Under his successor Edmund, 2nd Earl of Cornwall towards the end of the 13th century the d'Ivry holding was merged with the Duchy of Cornwall. The royal estate at Hampton Gay became part of the honour of Gloucester and thereby followed the same descent as the manor of Finmere. The Domesday Book of 1086 records that one Rainald was the tenant of both the d'Ivry and the royal estate. The de Gay family were tenants of both estates by about 1137 and remained so until 1222. Hampton Gay's toponym combines their surname with the Old English for a village or farm. In about 1170 Reginald de Gay gave a virgate of land (about ) to the house of the Knights Templar at Cowley, Oxfordshire. In about 1311 the Templars were suppressed and their holding at Hampton Gay was transferred to the Knights Hospitaller of Saint John of Jerusalem. In about 1218 Robert de Gay gave the tenancy of half a hide of the St. Valery estate to the Benedictine convent at Godstow. Between 1195 and 1205 the Augustinian Abbey of Osney bought the tenancy of two virgates at Hampton Gay from Robert de Gay, who in stages from 1210 to 1222 gave the remainder of his tenancy to the abbey. The three religious orders retained their estates at Hampton Gay until 1539, when they were suppressed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries and forfeited their lands to the Crown, which in 1542 sold Hampton Gay to Leonard Chamberlayne of Shirburn. In 1544 Chamberlayne sold the estate to John Barry of Eynsham, whose family owned Hampton Gay until they got into financial difficulties and sold it in 1682. The neglected ruin of Hampton Gay's 16th century manor house is registered by English Heritage as being \\"at risk\\" The new owner was Sir Richard Wenman, MP who in 1686 became 4th Viscount Wenman. Wenman died in 1690 and his widow sold Hampton Gay in 1691 to William Hindes of Priors Marston in Warwickshire. The Hindes family owned Hampton Gay until 1798 when Susannah, widow of Thomas Hindes, died without a male heir and left the manor to their daughter Anne and her husband. The manor changed hands again in 1809 and 1849, and in 1862 was bought by Wadham College, Oxford. In 1928 the college sold Hampton Gay to Colonel S.L. Barry of Long Crendon, Buckinghamshire, a descendant of the Barry family who had owned the manor in the 16th and 17th centuries. On his death in 1943 Col. Barry left the estate to his daughter Jeanne and her husband, the Honourable James McDonnell. The Barry family built the manor house in the 16th century. It has an E-shaped plan with gabled wings and a battlemented central porch. Its Elizabethan form remained unaltered until the 19th century, including original Elizabethan panelling in its principal rooms, but in 1809 it was reported to be in a neglected state. In the 1880s the house was divided into two tenements but in 1887 it was gutted by fire. It has never been restored and remains an ivy-clad ruin. It is a Grade II listed building and a scheduled monument. Early in the 21st century English Heritage placed the manor house ruins on its register of historic buildings at risk, listing its priority as \\"A\\" and its condition as \\"very bad\\". Parish church Tithe records show that Hampton Gay had a parish church by 1074. The Church of england parish church of Saint Giles had included features from at least as early as the 13th century, but in 1767‚Äì72 the Rev. Thomas Hindes, a member of the family that then owned the manor, had it completely rebuilt. In 1842 the antiquarian J.H. Parker condemned St. Giles' Georgian architecture as \\"a very bad specimen of the meeting-house style\\". In 1859‚Äì60 the curate, Rev. F. C. Hingeston, altered the church to his own designs, replacing its round-headed Georgian windows with ones in an Early English Gothic style and having the south doorway re-cut in a Norman revival fashion. St. Giles contains a number of monuments, most of them to the Barry family. The most notable is a 17th- century wall monument with kneeling effigies of Vincent and Anne Barry and their daughter Lady Katherine Fenner. St. Giles' parish is now part of the Church of England benefice of Akeman, which includes the parishes of Bletchingdon, Chesterton, Kirtlington, Middleton Stoney, Wendlebury and Weston-on-the-Green. Economic and social history Hampton Gay had a water mill on the River Cherwell by 1219, when it became the property of Osney Abbey. It was a grist mill until 1681, when Vincent Barry leased it to a Mr Hutton, who converted it into a paper mill. In 1684 Hutton took over the corn mill at Adderbury Grounds, upstream of Hampton Gay, and converted that into a paper mill. The mills produced pulp, but the paper was made in batches by hand until 1812, when Hampton Gay mill was re-equipped with a modern Fourdrinier machine that made paper mechanically and continuously. In 1863‚Äì73 the paper mill was rebuilt with a gasworks, steam engine and other machinery. In 1875 it was destroyed by fire but from 1876 it was restored to production. In 1880 it had both a water wheel powered by the river and a steam engine fed by a Cornish boiler, and could produce about a ton of paper per day. The tenants running the mill were J. and B. New, and when the manor house was divided they became tenants of one of its two portions. However, by 1887 the News had gone bankrupt and their stock in trade was sold to settle unpaid rent. Hampton Gay's population was more numerous in mediaeval times than at present. However it declined, and in 1428 the village was exempted from taxation because it had fewer than 10 householders. John Barry, who bought the manor in 1544, had made his money from wool, and he or his heirs enclosed land at Hampton Gay for sheep pasture. In 1596 Hampton Gay villagers joined those from Hampton Poyle who were plotting an agrarian revolt against the enclosures. The rebels planned to murder landowners including Vincent Barry and his daughter and then to march on London. A carpenter at Hampton Gay warned Barry, five ringleaders were arrested and taken to London for trial, and one was sentenced to be hanged and quartered. However, the Government also recognised the cause of the rebels' grievance and determined that \\"order should be taken about inclosures...that the poor may be able to live\\". Parliament duly passed an Act (39 Eliz. 1 c. 2) to restore to arable use all lands that had been converted to pasture since the accession of Elizabeth I in 1558. Manor Farm house was built early in the 17th century. It has a gabled front of three bays, original clustered chimney-stacks and a Stonesfield slate roof. A wing was added to the house in the 19th century. The Oxford and Rugby Railway between and was built past Hampton Gay in 1848‚Äì49. The nearest station provided was , more than to the south. The Shipton-on-Cherwell train crash, one of the worst accidents in British railway history, occurred near the village in 1874. Workers at a paper mill in Hampton Gay assisted the injured, and the inquest took place at Hampton Gay manor. British Railways closed Kidlington station in 1964 but the railway remains open as part of the Cherwell Valley Line. Hampton Gay was a separate civil parish until 1932 when it was merged with the adjacent parish of Hampton Poyle.

History  Between Past and Future was published for the first time in 1961 by The Viking Press in the United States and by Faber and Faber in Great Britain. The first edition consisted of six essays, and two more were added to a 1968 revision. The book is a collection of various essays written between 1954 and 1968. The final version of the book includes essays dealing with different philosophical subjects including freedom, education, authority, tradition, history and politics. The subtitle of the final version is Eight Exercises in Political Thought.  Structure and content  The book consists of a preface and eight essays: \\"Tradition and the Modern Age\\", \\"The Concept of History: Ancient and Modern\\", \\"What Is Authority?\\", \\"What Is Freedom?\\", \\"The Crisis in Education\\" and \\"The Crisis in Culture: Its social and political influence\\",\\"Truth and Politics\\" and \\"The Conquest of Space and the Stature of Man\\". All of the essays share a central idea. Humans are living between the past and the uncertain future. They must permanently think to exist, and each man is required to learn thinking. For a long time humans have resorted to tradition, but in modern times, this tradition has been abandoned, there is no more respect for tradition and culture. With her essays, Hannah Arendt tries to find solutions to help humans think again today. According to her, there is no way to live again with tradition, and modern philosophy has not succeeded in helping humans to live correctly. Preface The title of the preface is The Gap between Past and Future. The first sentence of the preface is a citation of French poet and r√©sistant Ren√© Char: \\"Notre h√©ritage n'est pr√©c√©d√© d'aucun testament,\\" translated by Arendt herself as \\"our inheritance was left to us by no testament.\\" For Arendt, this sentence perfectly illustrates the situation in which European peoples are left after the Second World War. It also illustrates the crisis in culture‚Äìthe main subject of the sixth essay. Indeed, the absence of testament means the current breaking-off with tradition. To characterize the way writers, men of letters and thinkers had lived the period of the French R√©sistance, Hannah Arendt speaks of a \\"treasure.\\" Indeed, Ren√© Char had stated during this period: \\"If I survive, I know that I have to break with the aroma of these essential years, silently reject my treasure.\\" This treasure is the experience of freedom all intellectuals made during this unique period, when they left their traditional occupation, that is a life focused on their personal affairs and the quest of themselves. With the Resistance, these men had at last found themselves, they had discovered what is freedom. But with the Liberation, they had lost their treasure, in other words they had either to return to their past occupations or to be involved again in public life but defending ideologies and engaging themselves into endless polemics, which had nothing to do with the time of the Resistance movement. The example of the French Resistance is one of the several historical experiences in which a treasure appears and then disappears. It was the case with the Revolutions of 1776 in the United States, 1789 in France or 1956 in Budapest. Although this treasure has no name, it was called public happiness in the United States in the eighteenth century. Any time this treasure appeared, it did not remain, not because of historical events nor chance, \\"but because no tradition had foreseen its appearance,\\" no tradition or no \\"testament\\" had been able to announce the coming and the reality of this treasure. Indeed, tradition is what \\"selects and names, (...) hands down and preserves, (...) indicates where the treasures are and what their worth is.\\" Analysis of the history of Western philosophy According to Arendt, the origins of European philosophical thinking date back to Ancient Greece, with Aristotle and Plato. Plato had taught us that the truth was not present within the society and in public affairs, but in eternal ideas, as demonstrated in the allegory of the cave. On the contrary, Marx thought that the \\"truth is not outside the affairs of men and their common world but precisely in them.\\" The end of Platonic and Aristotelean tradition of philosophy came with Marx, according to whom the philosopher had to turn away from philosophy in order to be involved in society and human affairs in order to change the world. For Arendt, Marxist philosophy considers that man creates himself, that his humanity is the result of his own activity, and that what distinguishes man from animal is not reason but labor. Thus Marx challenges the traditional praise of reason. Moreover, for Marx violence is the leading force that determines human relations, while for the traditional thought it is the most disgraceful of human actions and the symbol of tyranny.

He is founder and leading figure of the World Poetry Almanac. In 2006, he established the World Poetry Almanac. His early poetry is strongly influenced by the Mongolian epic and influenced by Russian imagist poetry and Italian hermetic poetry of the 20th Century. Hadaa Sendoo is considered one of the Greatest Poets of All Time and the great poet in the 21st century. Roots Hadaa Sendoo was born in 1961 in Southern Mongolia, today's Inner Mongolia, and grew up in Shiiliigool. His father was the head of a theatre and his mother was a drama actor. Sendoo has lived in Ulan Bator, the capital of Mongolia, since 1991. Early years When Hadaa Sendoo was very young, his father moved his family to Southern Mongolia, near the Dalan Har Mountains, where Hadaa spent his childhood. He studied old Mongolian and also Chinese at the local high school, but tired of the school curriculum, he later returned to the steppe for a nomadic life until 1984, when his father recommended that he should enter an art institute, where he soon served as an editorial assistant. The young Hadaa has had the opportunity to read a lot of Mongolian literature - certainly the classics, and thus epics, including the Jangar, Books of Mongolian Folk Songs, and also Modernist Poetry (Shuleg). In 1989, he published his first collection of poems The Nomadic Songs and Moonlight. In 1991, he moved to Northern Mongolia and ever since has lived in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, where he teaches at the university as a professor of literature, and is doing research in Mongolian folk literature, including folk songs, and in Mongolian mythology. In 1996, Hadaa Sendoo published his first collection of poems written in Cyrillic new Mongolian. In 1998, he formally joined the Mongolian Writers Union. In 1999, Hadaa and his friends co-founded a cultural magazine called The World's Mongolians (a Mongolian - English bilingual edition) that is published in Mongolia. In the summer of the same year, Hadaa and his bosom friend S. Tserendorj, who is also a Mongolian poet, organized the first Asian Poetry Festival in Ulaanbaatar. Hadaa has won the Athens City Hall Prize and the 2nd Olympics of Culture Prize (Athens,1999). He has taught at the National University of Mongolia. On the way to poetry In his middle age, Hadaa Sendoo wrote many poems, and his poetic style was very different from that of the past. On September 24, 2011, Hadaa joined the World Poetry Movement and thus became one of its earliest member who were founding the World Poetry Movement.See . See also the reference to this movement in printed books, for instance in: Jackie Hardcastle, Visions in Poetry (2015), p. II. In 2012, Hadaa Sendoo was invited to the largest poetry festival ever staged in the UK, the Southbank Centre's Poetry Parnassus, where he read his poetry and discussed his work as part of the festival.See \\"Parnassus, series 3, no. 17, 2012\\", ed. by David Constantine, in: mpT Modern Poetry in Translation, 2012. ‚Äì See also: .

See also: . Hadaa Sendoo is currently a consulting editor of the International Literary Quarterly. Poets talking about poetry of Hadaa Sendoo Cambridge University Professor and Poet Richard Berengarten wrote about one of Hadaa Sendoo's works: \\"I have read this book through carefully. More important, I was delighted to discover the depth and breadth of his great vision. This impression of mine was strengthened when I read the last prose text on the \\"Poet of the 21st century\\" in the bool Come Back to Earth, and his poem \\"The Wind\\". Both these texts connect with my concept of the \\"universalist poet\\" and \\"universalist poetry\\". The theme of the wind (air, breath, spirit) is a very profound one. The poems in Come Back to Earth gave me a sense of the wide spaces of Mongolia and also made me sad for the culture that has been lost. They reminded me of the fine movies The Cave of the Yellow Dog and Story of the Weeping Camel. \\" Germany's writer Rainer Wedler , said: \\"The poems of the Mongolian poet Hadaa Sendoo give an insight into a little-known area of literary geography\\". Germany's Andreas Weiland, an art critic, said: \\"Hadaa Sendoo's poetry echoes his life, nature, the wide land, the wind of Mongolia. I try to listen to the rhythm. I pay attention to the poetic quality of each line. I think that lines in his poetry like \\"resigned to another death\\" or \\"glad to die another death\\" both refer to reincarnation. We die so many deaths, because we are reborn, according to Shamanist and Buddhist (and other) beliefs. His poems touch my heart and evoke thoughts and strong emotions, intense images. I think highly of Hadaa Sendoo as a sensitive and real poet\\".

Such treatments can take many forms, including everything from surgery, taking certain drugs or nutritional supplements, to lifestyle alterations such as increased exercise and avoidance of migraine triggers. The goals of preventive therapy are to reduce the frequency, painfulness, and/or duration of migraines, and to increase the effectiveness of abortive therapy. Another reason to pursue these goals is to avoid medication overuse headache (MOH), otherwise known as rebound headache, which is a common problem among migraineurs. This is believed to occur in part due to overuse of pain medications, and can result in chronic daily headache. Standards for the conducts of trials of preventive medications have been proposed by the Task Force of the International Headache Society Clinical Trials Subcommittee. Behavioral treatments Exercise for 15‚Äì20 minutes per day may be helpful for reducing the frequency of migraines.http://www.headachedrugs.com/ Diet, visualization, and self-hypnosis are also alternative treatments and prevention approaches. General dietary restriction has not been demonstrated to be an effective approach to treating migraine. Sexual activity has been reported by a proportion of male and female migraine sufferers to relieve migraine pain significantly in some cases. Medications A 2006 review article by S. Modi and D. Lowder offers some general guidelines on when a physician should consider prescribing drugs for migraine prevention: Preventive medication has to be taken on a daily basis, usually for a few weeks, before the effectiveness can be determined. Supervision by a neurologist is advisable. A large number of medications with varying modes of action can be used. Selection of a suitable medication for any particular patient is a matter of trial and error, since the effectiveness of individual medications varies widely from one patient to the next. Often preventive medications do not have to be taken indefinitely. Sometimes as little as six months of preventive therapy is enough to \\"break the headache cycle\\" and then they can be discontinued. The most effective prescription medications include several drug classes. Beta blockers A meta-analysis found that propranolol had an \\"overall relative risk of response to treatment (here called the 'responder ratio')\\" was 1.94. Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsants such as valproic acid and topiramate. A meta-analysis by the Cochrane Collaboration of ten randomized controlled trials or crossover studies, which together included 1341 patients, found anticonvulsants had an \\"2.4 times more likely to experience a 50% or greater reduction in frequency with anticonvulsants than with placebo\\" and a number needed to treat of 3.8. However, concerns have been raised about the marketing of gabapentin. Antidepressant Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) such as amitriptyline and the newer selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine are sometimes prescribed. Tricyclic antidepressants have been found to be more effective than SSRIs. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are no more effective than placebo. Another meta-analysis found benefit from SSRIs among patients with migraine or tension headache; however, the effect of SSRIs on only migraines was not separately reported. Other A wide range of other pharmacological drugs have been evaluated to determine their efficacy in reducing the frequency or severity of migraine attacks. These drugs include beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, neurostabalizers, nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), other antidepressants, and other specialized drug therapies. The US Headache Consortium lists five drugs as having medium to high efficacy: amitriptyline, divalproex, timolol, propranolol and topiramate. Lower efficacy drugs listed include aspirin, atenolol, fenoprofen, flurbiprofen, fluoxetine, gabapentin, ketoprofen, metoprolol, nadolol, naproxen, nimodipine, verapamil and Botulinum A. Additionally, most antidepressants (tricyclic, SSRIs and others such as Bupropion) are listed as \\"clinically efficacious based on consensus of experience\\" without scientific support. Many of these drugs may give rise to undesirable side-effects, or may be efficacious in treating comorbid conditions, such as depression. * Methysergide was withdrawn from the US market by Novartis, but is available in Canadian pharmacies. Although highly effective, it has rare but serious side effects, including retroperitoneal fibrosis. * Methylergometrine remains available in the US and is an active metabolite of methysergide. It is thought to carry the same risks and benefits as methysergide but has not been widely studied in migraine. * Memantine, which is used in the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease, is beginning to be used off label for the treatment of migraines. It has not yet been approved by the FDA for the treatment of migraines. * Aspirin can be taken daily in low doses such as 80 mg. The blood thinners in ASA have been shown to help some migraineurs, especially those who have an aura. * Placebo is as effective as adding propanolol to patients not adequately controlled on topiramate. In a randomized controlled trial, both groups reduced their days with migraine by half. * L-cysteine as a slow release formulation is being studied for migraine prevention.\\"The Efficacy of L-cysteine in Prevention of Headache Attacks in Migraine Patients\\". https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02315833 Medical devices Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation A transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation device called Cefaly was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States on March 11, 2014 for the prevention of migraines; this was the first medical device to get FDA approval for this purpose. Neurostimulation Neurostimulation initially used implantable neurostimulators similar to pacemakers for the treatment of intractable chronic migraines with encouraging good results. But the needed surgery with implantable neurostimulators is limiting the indication to severe cases. Transcranial magnetic stimulation At the 49th Annual meeting of the American Headache Society in June 2006, scientists from Ohio State University Medical Center presented medical research on 47 candidates that demonstrated that TMS -- a medically non-invasive technology for treating depression, obsessive compulsive disorder and tinnitus, among other ailments -- helped to prevent and even reduce the severity of migraines among its patients. This treatment essentially disrupts the aura phase of migraines before patients develop full-blown migraines. In about 74% of the migraine headaches, TMS was found to eliminate or reduce nausea and sensitivity to noise and light.http://www.shns.com Their research suggests that there is a strong neurological component to migraines. A larger study will be conducted soon to better assess TMS's complete effectiveness. Biofeedback Biofeedback has been used successfully by some to control migraine symptoms through training and practice.Biofeedback helps patient to be conscious of some physiologic parameters to control them and try to relax. This method is considered to be efficient for migraine prevention. Surgery There have been major pharmacological advances for the treatment of migraine headaches, yet patients must still endure symptoms until the medications take effect. Furthermore, often they still experience a poor quality of life despite an aggressive regimen of pharmacotherapy. Migraine surgery techniques have proven most effective in selected patients, often resulting in permanent migraine prevention. The most effective appear to be those involving the surgical cauterization of the superficial blood vessels of the scalp (the terminal branches of the external carotid artery), and the removal of muscles in areas known as \\"trigger sites\\". Arterial surgery Surgical cauterization of the superficial blood vessels of the scalp (the terminal branches of the external carotid artery) is only carried out if it has been established with certainty that these vessels are indeed the source of pain. It is a safe and relatively atraumatic procedure which can be performed in a day facility. Nerve decompression Migraine surgery which involves decompression of certain nerves around the head and neck may be an option in certain people who do not improve with medications. It is only effective in those who respond well to Botox injections in specific areas. Botulinum toxin injection Botulinum neurotoxin (Botox) injections have been approved in the US and UK for prevention of chronic migraines,BOTOX(R) Receives First Authorisation in UK as Preventative Treatment in Chronic Migraine but do not appear to work for episodic migraines. Several invasive surgical procedures are currently under investigation. One involves the surgical removal of specific muscles or the transection of specific cranial nerve branches in the area of one or more of four identified trigger points. Closure of patent foramen ovale There also appears to be a causal link between the presence of a patent foramen ovale and migraines. There is evidence that the correction of the congenital heart defect, patent foramen ovale (PFO), reduces migraine frequency and severity. Recent studies have advised caution, though, in relation to PFO closure for migraines, as insufficient evidence exists to justify this dangerous procedure. Alternative medicine Acupuncture Cochrane reviews have found that acupuncture is effective in the treatment of migraines. The use of \\"true\\" acupuncture seems to be slightly more effective than sham acupuncture, however, both \\"true\\" and sham acupuncture appear to be at least similarly effective as treatment with preventative medications, with fewer adverse effects.

A number of clinical trials have been carried out to test this claim, but a 2004 review article concluded that the results have been contradictory and inconclusive. Manual therapy A systematic review stated that chiropractic manipulation, physiotherapy, massage and relaxation might be as effective as propranolol or topiramate in the prevention of migraine headaches; however, the research had some problems with methodology.

The eponymous surrounding Bruintjieshoogte mountain range lies between the Sundays River, Renosterberg, the Groot Winterhoek Mountains, Camdeboo National Park, and the Sneeuberge and forms a watershed for the Little Fish River (a tributary of the Great Fish River) and the western side of the Blyde River (tributary of the Sundays River). The highest peak in the range is 1,757 m above sea level. The first white settlers came to the area in the 1770s. In 1776, Swedish naturalist Anders Sparrman described the area as the most beautiful he had ever seen, and was shortly followed in September 1778 by the Governor of the Cape of Good Hope Joachim van Plettenberg. Although the Dutch East India Company declared the mountains the eastern border of Dutch Cape Colony in 1770, this did not stop settlers from farming the fertile Little Fish River valley. The history of the region was marked by struggles over boundaries, cattle theft, and resistance to government authority by Trekboers, Xhosa, Khoikhoi, San, and the British government. Shortly before 1780, adventurer Coenraad de Buys visited the area, as did Sir John Barrow, 1st Baronet, who was not fond of the Trekboers' behavior. The local inhabitants played roles in the Van Jaarsveld Rebellion of 1799 and the Slachter's Nek Rebellion of 1815, and the area was strategic during the Fourth Frontier War of 1810‚Äì11. Since 1991, an annual marathon and tour has been held here.  Sources  * B√∂eseken, A.J. (1966). Die Nuusbode. Cape Town: Nasou. * Gie, S.F.N. (1955).

Background He was the only son of Sir Tristram Beresford, 3rd Baronet, and his wife Nichola Sophia Hamilton, youngest daughter of Hugh Hamilton, 1st Viscount of Glenawly and his second wife Susanna Balfour. In 1701 his father died and Beresford, aged only five, succeeded to the baronetcy. His guardian was The 3rd Viscount Dungannon (1669-1706). After Lord Dungannon's death in 1706, his widow (Beresford's maternal aunt), Arabella, Viscountess Dungannon, served as Beresford's guardian. Career In 1715, he entered the Irish House of Commons, sitting for Coleraine until 1720, when he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland with the titles Baron Beresford, of Beresford, in the County of Cavan, and Viscount Tyrone by King George I of Great Britain. A year later, he joined the Irish House of Lords. In 1736, he became Grandmaster of the Grand Lodge of Ireland, serving for the next two years. Beresford was further honoured in 1746, when he was created Earl of Tyrone. Family On 18 July 1717, he married Catherine, only daughter of James Power, 3rd Earl of Tyrone and had by her seven sons and eight daughters. Beresford died at Tyrone House in Dublin and was succeeded in his titles by his fourth and oldest surviving son George. His fifth son John was also a Member of Parliament and his seventh son William was ennobled in his own right as Baron Decies. His third daughter Catherine married Thomas Christmas MP, and after his death remarried to Theophilus Jones MP. His fifth daughter Frances married the statesman Henry Flood, and the sixth daughter Eliza married Colonel Thomas Cobbe MP. In 1767, four years after the earl's death, his wife claimed the title Baron La Poer and was shortly thereafter confirmed. She died in 1769.

G. Wells. It is a cautionary tale about simple human greed. The taxidermist of Wells‚Äô story \\"Triumphs of a Taxidermist\\" (1894) makes a return appearance as the narrator of the story. The story was originally published anonymously in the December 20th, 1894 issue of the Pall Mall Gazette and later published in the 1895 short story collection The Stolen Bacillus and Other Incidents. The story is the tale of a carefully crafted and skillfully executed con that exploited the natural greed the protagonist's fellow passengers. Plot The taxidermist is talking with an unnamed acquaintance about the price of birds when he tells the story of a bird auction on an East India Company ship en route from India to London. Sir Mohini Padishah, a wealthy native Indian, is aboard the vessel. An unnamed caretaker, was on deck with five ostriches when one of the birds swallowed the diamond from Padishah‚Äôs turban. The bird becomes mixed with the others during the resulting confusion. Word of the incident sweeps the vessel as Padishah demands the return of the diamond. He swore he would retrieve the diamond, but would not buy the birds. He demands his rights as a British Subject and plans to appeal to the British House of Lords. The passengers debate the legalities of the situation. As no barrister is aboard, much of the discussions are speculation. Padishah demands the ostriches from the caretaker who refuses because he does not own the birds. Following a stopover in Aden, Padishah offers to buy all five birds. The caretaker refuses, but tells Padishah that another passenger, Potter, made a similar offer. While in Aden, Potter wired the birds owners in London, made the offer and his answer would be waiting in Suez. He intends to kill the birds to find the diamond. Padisha raged over this and the taxidermist cursed himself for not having thought of it. The birds‚Äô owner accepted Potter‚Äôs offer and Padishah wept over the sale. Potter offered to sell the birds to Padishah for more than twice the amount he paid. When Padishah balked, Potter sells the birds at auction on the ship. Interest in the auction flared when a Jewish diamond merchant assessed the diamond at three to four thousand British Pounds. After the first bird sold was slaughtered upon the deck, Potter forbid their slaughter until landfall in London. The price for each subsequent bird grew netting Potter more than one thousand Pounds. Padishah provided each new owner with his address and begged the men to mail the diamond once they found it. They rebuffed him and went their own ways. A week later, the taxidermist sees Padishah and Potter together in London.Wells, H.G. H.G. Wells: The Complete Short Stories. Ernest Benn Ltd., London. Twenty First Edition. 1970. Page 229.

It was founded on 1 June 1604, through the issuance of letter patents by Henry IV to Dieppe merchants, with an eye on the Far East trade possibilities. The establishment of the company gave the merchants exclusive rights (within France, at least) to the Asian trade for 15 years, but in the event, no trading expeditions were mounted by the company under this name.Asia in the Making of Europe, Volume III: A Century of Advance. Book 1 by Donald F. Lach pp. 93‚Äì94 After the king's death in 1610, the charter was renewed in 1611, for a period of 12 years. The company remained inactive however during the troubles of the regency of Marie de Medicis, and other cities such as Rouen maneuvered to also obtain trading rights. In 1615, Marie de Medicis caused the different parties to be joined into the Company of the Moluccas, with trading privileges for 18 years. In 1616, two expeditions were dispatched to Asia from Honfleur in Normandy: three ships left for India, and two ships for Bantam. One ship returned from Bantam in 1617 with a small cargo, and letters from the Dutch expressing their hostility towards French ships in the East Indies. Also in 1616, two ships were sent from Saint-Malo to Java. One was captured by the Dutch, but the other obtained an agreement from the ruler of Pondicherry to build a fortress and a factory there, and came back with a rich cargo. In 1619, an armed expedition composed of three ships (275 crew, 106 cannons) was sent from Honfleur, to fight the Dutch in the Far East. They encountered the Dutch fleet off Sumatra. One ship was captured, another remained in Asia for inter-country trade, and the third returned to Le Havre in 1622. In 1624, the Treaty of Compi√®gne was negotiated by French Cardinal Richelieu and Dutch ambassadors. It agreed that French and Dutch forces would cease fighting the French in the Far East.

He was a recipient of the Ophir Award for lifetime achievements. Biography Heffner served in the IDF with the Nahal Army Band. After his IDF service, he studied French literature at the Sorbonne, Paris. His love for the cinema began, according to him, at the age of 17. He began his career as an actor (in Uri Zohar's Hor BaLevana). His first movie as director was Slow Down (1967), an adaptation of a short story by Simone de Beauvoir, which won him the Silver Lion Award at the 1969 Venice Film Festival. In the 1960s and the 1970s he was among the Israeli directors creating more personal and social films (in the \\"New Sensitivity\\" genre), films that were influenced from the Avant-garde-European cinema. The most significant example for these type of films is Heffner's first feature, But Where Is Daniel Wax?, which he wrote and directed. But Where Is Daniel Wax?, Heffner's most important and famous film, is considered by film critics and Israeli film researchers to be the best Israeli movie of all time. Two other films of his, Aunt Clara (1977) and Laura Adler's Last Love Affair, are considered to be a eulogy to the old Yiddish speakers, European Jews who live in Israel. Aunt Clara, a semi-autobiographical film about Heffner's own family, tells the story of three Poland-born aunts in Israel, who are looking after their young nieces. Laura Adler's Last Love Affair is a eulogy to the Israeli Yiddish theater and its old actors. The television film he created in 1998, Eretz Ktana, Ish Gadol [Small Country, Great Man], is a cynical look at the ever-changing State of Israel of the 1990s and the Zionist myths, which in Heffner's opinion, are now gone. Heffner lectured for many years on filmmaking and screenwriting at the Tel Aviv University.Open Letter from Faculty Members In 2004, Heffner won the Ophir Award for his life-time of achievements in Israeli Cinema.

He also tried his hand at stand up comedy performing at the Improv in New York and the Comedy Store in Los Angeles. Career Garfinkel launched his career in 1978 as a junior copywriter at a small advertising agency called James Neal Harvey. After only two months, he left to take a job at the creative agency, Levine Huntley Schmidt Plapler and Beaver, where he stayed for eleven years. Rising from junior copywriter to executive creative director in just a few years, Lee wrote or supervised successful campaigns for Subaru, Citizen Watches, Matchbox cars, Ferrarelle Mineral Water and Genesee Beer. In 1989, he was recruited by BBDO to head up the Pepsi account. During his time at BBDO, he wrote some of Pepsi's most famous commercials including the original Cindy Crawford commercial. After three years of working primarily on Pepsi, London Ad man Frank Lowe enticed Lee to become the Creative Leader of IPG agency, Lowe New York. Lee worked at Lowe & Partners for eight years, eventually becoming Chairman, CEO and Chief Creative Officer, U.S. During his tenure he was credited with turning Lowe into one of the most creative agencies in America. He worked on such brands as Mercedes-Benz, Diet Coke (the famous Diet Coke Construction Worker commercial), Sprite (Obey Your Thirst), Heineken (It's All About the Beer), Citibank, Sun Microsystems, KPMG, Sony, CBS and GMC trucks. In 2001, Lee moved to D'Arcy as President and World Wide Creative Director. He was soon followed by the Heineken account which had experienced significant success under his creative leadership. During his short time at D'Arcy, Lee also helped revitalize such brands as Crest and Cadillac. When Maurice Levy and Publicis purchased D'Arcy, Lee was offered the role of Global Creative Director of the Publicis advertising agency. Instead Lee chose to team up with his friend Ken Kaess, CEO of DDB. Lee started at DDB NY in March 2003 as Chairman, Chief Creative Officer. During his tenure, he helped DDB gain new assignments on Bud Light and Michelob. He was also responsible for the biggest stretch of new business wins in DDB NY's recent history, winning such accounts as Diet Pepsi, Philips Global, Subaru, Lipton Tea, The American Cotton Council, United Technologies Corp., Electrolux Appliances, Hertz, Legg Mason, Georgia Pacific and Gibson Guitars. Lee was also the architect behind Amplify, the digital group within DDB New York. In 2011, Lee joined EuroRSCG (now known as Havas Worldwide) as chief creative officer, Global Brands. He created new campaigns for Atlantic City Tourism (DO AC), New York Life (Keep Good Going) as well as supervising the successful \\"Most Interesting Man\\" campaign for Dos Equis. On January 1, 2014, Lee returned to holding company, IPG and assumed the role of CEO at Draftfcb New York. On March 10, 2014, Draftfcb officially changed its name to FCB (Foote, Cone and Belding) and renamed the New York office FCB Garfinkel in recognition of Lee's creative standards. Today, Lee is the Chairman of The Garfinkel Group LLC. Awards and recognition Lee Garfinkel has received every major advertising award. In addition to winning Cannes Lions for Subaru, Pepsi, Mercedes, Beneficial and Heineken, his industry honors also include One Show, ANDY and Clio awards. Garfinkel has served as President of the One Club (1991‚Äì1993); he chaired the ANDY Awards in 1998 and in 2002 he was the U.S. Juror at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival. Timeline In 1986, Adweek chose Lee for the magazine‚Äôs East Coast All-Star Team of Best TV Copywriters. Three years later, Adweek‚Äôs Winners Magazine selected him as the #1 Copywriter and #3 Creative Director in the United States. In 1992, Lee was selected by Crain‚Äôs New York Business for its annual ‚ÄúForty under 40‚Äù feature, which profiles executives under 40 making their mark in business. In 1994, Lee was inducted into the Advertising Hall of Achievement. The following year, Adweek once again chose him for their U.S. All-Star Team, this time as Best Creative Director. In 1998, Lee was featured in the Wall Street Journal‚Äôs creative leader series. And in 2005, Lee was part of the management team responsible for DDB being named Adweek‚Äôs ‚ÄúGlobal Agency of the Year.‚Äù See also * D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles * DDB Worldwide * Lowe and Partners Notes References  * THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; CBS loves TV; now the network wants viewers to fancy CBS. - New York Times * Mercedes-Benz's new campaign is injecting fun-loving spirit into precise German engineering. - New York Times * THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Lowe & Partners/SMS gets back on track by winning a big-name electronics account. - New York Times * THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Beneficial Goes After Banks - New York Times * Mediaweek.co.uk * http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising- branding/draftfcb-unveiling-its-rebranding-156184 Further reading * Forbes.com * Huffingtonpost.com * Adweek.com * Cnbc.com * Adweek.com * Adweek.com * Adweek.com * Adweek.com * Nytimes.com * Adweek.com * Findarticles.com * Mycrains.crainsnewyork.com External links * * * https://vimeo.com/leegarfinkeluser44369243 * http://www.thegarfinkelgroup.com * Ibbonline.com * Wflx.com * Diaryofacreativedirector.com * Aef.com * Diaryofacreativedirector.com * Jackmyers.com * Ihaveanidea.org * http://www.leegarfinkel.com/LeeGarfinkel/About_Me.html * http://www.leegarfinkel.com/LeeGarfinkel/Campaigns.html Category:Advertising people Category:1955 births Category:Living people ","title":"Lee Garfinkel"},{"id":"25045284","text":"Nesselande is a station on Line B of the Rotterdam Metro and is situated in Rotterdam-Nesselande.

The league is held over a period of a few months yearly, to promote sports and nurture healthy lifestyle amongst the disabled as well as providing local competitiveness opportunities. It serves as a platform for people with disabilities to participate in the event on both a recreational and competitive level, as well as to create better awareness of disability sports amongst the able-bodied community. Introduced by the Singapore Disability Sports Council (SDSC) in 2006, the National Disability League (NDL) replaced the National Disability Games which started from 2002. This new league format allowed participants to compete across three months, increasing their opportunities for exposure and social interaction. Between the years of 2002 and 2005, the spirit of the games has grown tremendously as the National Disability Games functioned as a series of disability sports events spread over seven challenging and competitive days. This strongly signifies the increasing number of disabled people who are keen to participate in sports- related activities and it confirms the proven popularity of this league structure. In 2006, SDSC has transformed the National Disability Games into the very first National Disability League (NDL), spreading across two to three months of highly anticipated competitive sports experience and exposure. NDL had provided a sustainable platform to enhance the performance growth and 'feel' of competition during the three months. By inducting a sustainable platform, it allowed athletes to review areas of improvement in their performances and strive to improve during their next round of competition. NDL 2009 saw the highest participation rate ever with 875 participants. These were a diverse mix of various disability groups from 12 voluntary welfare organisations, 6 special schools and 39 individuals. This was a remarkable achievement as compared to the previous years: * 2008 - 687 participants (with 7 sports) * 2007 - 518 participants (with 11 sports) * 2006 - 357 participants (with 13 sports) The 15 sports offered in 2009 were archery, badminton, basketball, boccia, bowling, chess, equestrianism, futsal, handcycling, lawn bowls, powerchair football, sailing, shooting, table tennis and wheelchair basketball. Besides its emphasis on sustainable sports development, NDL focuses on spotting sports talents as well and serves as an avenue to select athletes to represent Singapore at International and regional competitions such as the 1st Asian Youth Paralympic Games 2009 in Tokyo, Japan and the 5th ASEAN ParaGames 2009 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Today, NDL has a unique position for sports development as it allows all athletes to have a continuous and sustainable competition platform. It gives each athlete the feel of competition, placing them to play with athletes of different performance level, leading them to re-strategize their paradigm of winning games.

It was introduced in a 2003 paper by Francis McCabe and Keith Clark.  Design  The authors of Go! describe it as \\"a multi-paradigm programming language that is oriented to the needs of programming secure, production quality and agent-based applications. It is multi-threaded, strongly typed and higher order (in the functional programming sense). It has relation, function and action procedure definitions. Threads execute action procedures, calling functions and querying relations as needed. Threads in different agents communicate and coordinate using asynchronous messages. Threads within the same agent can also use shared dynamic relations acting as Linda-style tuple stores.\\" The authors also propose that the language is suitable for representing ontologies due to its integration of logic, functional and imperative styles of programming.  Example  The following example illustrates the \\"ontology-oriented\\" type and declarations style of Go!: Sex ::= male  female. person <~ {dayOfBirth:[] => day. age:[] => integer. sex:[] => Sex. name:[] => string. home:[] => string. lives:[string]{}}. person:[string, day, Sex, string] $= person. person(Nm, Born, Sx, Hm)..{ dayOfBirth() => Born. age() => yearsBetween(now(), Born). sex() => Sx. name() => Nm. home() => Hm. lives(Pl) :- Pl = home(). yearsBetween:[integer, day] => integer. yearsBetween(...) => .. }. newPerson:[string, day, Sex, string] => person. newPerson(Nm, Born, Sx, Hm) => $person(Nm, Born, Sx, Hm). The \`::=\` rule defines a new algebraic data type, a data type with only data constructors. The \`<~\` rule defines an interface type - it indicates what properties are characteristic of a \`person\` and also gives type constraints on these properties. It documents that \`age\` is a functional property with an integer value, that \`lives\` is a unary relation over strings, and that \`dayOfBirth\` is a functional property with a value that is an object of type \`day\`. The \`$=\` type rule indicates that there is also a theory label, with the functor \`person\`, for a theory that defines the characteristic properties of the \`person\` type - implements the \`person\` interface - in terms of four given parameters of types \`string\`, \`day\` , \`Sex\`, and \`string\`. Conflict with Google In November 2009, Google released a similarly named Go programming language (with no exclamation point). McCabe asked Google to change the name of their language as he was concerned they were \\"steam-rolling over us\\". The issue received attention among technology news websites, with some of them characterizing Go! as \\"obscure\\". The issue thread opened on the subject was closed by a Google developer on 12 October 2010 with the custom status \\"Unfortunate\\" and with the following comment: \\"there are many computing products and services named Go. In the 11 months since our release, there has been minimal confusion of the two languages.\\"  References  Further reading  *  External links  * Github page * Code sample on 99-bottles-of-beer.net Category:Concurrent programming languages Category:Free compilers and interpreters Category:Programming languages created in 2003 ","title":"Go!

Holzberg found that Egan took a \\"dismissive, uncaring, and at times threatening attitude toward survivors\\"; he characterized the bishop's behavior as \\"profoundly unsympathetic, inadequate, and inflammatory\\". Holzberg's report, which stemmed from a year-long investigation, accused 71 priests of sexually abusing 300 children since 1953.

History  In 1963 the government made a resolution to establish an architectural university. In 1968 the resolution was changed and the government wished to build a telecommunication university. The university‚Äôs predecessor in title, the Transportation and Telecommunication Faculty of Technical Sciences, was established in this year. The faculty trained engineers for the transportation and telecommunication infrastructure. The building of the university was built‚Äîan unmatched exception in Hungary, originally for education purposes‚Äîon the picturesque bend of the Moson Danube within walking distance of the baroque city. In the early 1990s beyond the technical sciences, economical, medical and social programmes became in demand. In 1995 the E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University set up a law programme here, so the juridical training returned to the city and, since 2002, it is its own programme at Sz√©chenyi Istv√°n University. The institution bears the name of Istv√°n Sz√©chenyi the \\"greatest Hungarian\\" since 1986. The university offers several courses in BA/BSc and MA/MSc and doctoral schools are available.  Faculties  The university provides education at nine faculties and four doctoral schools: * Ap√°czai Csere J√°nos Faculty * Audi Hungaria Faculty of Automotive Engineering * De√°k Ferenc Faculty of Law and Political Sciences * Faculty of Agricultural and Food Sciences (its legal predecessor was established in 1818, the faculty joined the university in 2016) * Faculty of Architecture, Civil Engineering and Transport Sciences * Faculty of Art * Faculty of Health and Sport Sciences * Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Informatics and Electrical Engineering * Kautz Gyula Faculty of Economics * Doctoral School of Law and Political Sciences * Doctoral School of Multidisciplinary Engineering Sciences * Doctoral School of Regional- and Economic Sciences * Wittmann Antal Multidisciplinary Doctoral School of. Plant, Animal and Food Sciences  Developments  In May 2008, the new architectural studio was opened. It was converted from an old transformation house. Sz√©ch√©nyi Istv√°n University won on the calling for tender to improve public facilities. The university has several projects underway including AUTOPOLIS: The construction of a new building will expand the capacity of the university and will serve for research and development purposes. Within this project a foot-bridge will be re-located and two multi-storey car parks will be built. The project is estimated to be finished in 2011.  Student life  There are several opportunities for entertainment in Gy≈ër and at the university. Every year there is a Sz√©chenyi-week, where famous Hungarian people (writers, comedians, etc.) are invited. The university offers opportunities to do sport (rowing, soccer, swimming etc.). The Sz√©chenyi race takes stage during Sz√©chenyi-week. Alternative-operated vehicles challenge each other at the parking lot in front of the university.  References  * dr.

Later he studied under Roman Haubenstock-Ramati who became his most influential teacher and mentor. He received several awards and scholarships in Europe & US. Today Liberda lectures electronic music at the Universit√§t f√ºr Musik und Darstellende Kunst Wien. His ballet Valse triste (1978) was the first composition of electronic music ever to be performed in the Staatsoper Wien. By combining traditional and electronic instruments he explores the fascination of music as so aptly described by J√≥zef Maria Hoene-Wro≈Ñski: Music is the corporealization of the intelligence that is in sound. His scores are often the result of process-orientated, non-linear composing.

The son of a high-ranking government official, Timofeev graduated from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. Career In the late 1960s and 70s, Timofeev worked as a journalist for Moscow magazines such as Novy Mir and Kommunist. Timofeev's 1985 book The Technology of the Black Market or the Peasant Art of Starving was published in the West by Telos Press. The book presented a harsh condemnation of the Communist economic system. Timofeev was arrested and sentenced to 11 years of hard labour and internal exile on the grounds of \\"anti-Soviet propaganda\\". He was freed in 1987 by a special decree signed by Mikhail Gorbachev. In the late 1980s, Timofeev published Referendum magazine and served as chairman of the Moscow Helsinki Committee for Human Rights, a human rights watchdog. Timofeev became one of the most vocal proponents of economic liberalization in Russia. In 1993 Timofeev ran for parliament on the Democratic Russia ticket. He was appointed professor at the Russian State Humanitarian University, Timofeev was for many years director of the Center for Research on Extralegal Economic Systems and advised the government of Boris Yeltsin. In the mid-1990s he joined the Transnational Radical Party and became a member of its General Council. Timofeev is one of the leading theorists of drug decriminalization. In early 2000 Timofeev retired from politics and teaching and embarked on a career of a novelist: since 2004 he published three novels and a collection of short stories.

Virtually nothing is known about Shi Yuanzhong's background, including where he was born or where his family was from. As of 834, he was serving as a battlefield commander (ÂÖµÈ¶¨‰Ωø, Bingmashi) at Lulong, when the soldiers mutinied and expelled the military governor Yang Zhicheng and the eunuch monitor of the army Li Huaiwu (). The soldiers supported Shi to be their leader. Subsequently, after Shi submitted articles of clothing and other equipment that were of design only appropriate for an emperor, which Yang had made, to then-reigning Emperor Wenzong (to show that Yang had inappropriate ambitions), Yang was executed, and Emperor Wenzong made Shi the acting military governor (ÁïôÂæå, Liuhou). In 835, Emperor Wenzong made Shi military governor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 245. Little is known about Shi's governance of Lulong. In 841, there was another disturbance at Lulong, and Shi was killed in the disturbance. The soldiers initially supported the officer Chen Xingtai () to take over the circuit. Then-reigning Emperor Wuzong (Emperor Wenzong's younger brother), under the advice of the chancellor Li Deyu, declined to take immediate action on petitions submitted on Chen's behalf for Chen to become military governor. Soon thereafter, Chen himself was assassinated, and the soldiers supported another officer, Zhang Jiang () to be their leader. Emperor Wuzong similarly declined to act on petitions on Zhang's behalf. Thereafter, when Lulong officer Zhang Zhongwu, who was then the commander of Xiongwu Base (ÈõÑÊ≠¶Ëªç, in modern Chengde, Hebei), requested imperial commission and permission to attack Zhang Jiang, Emperor Wuzong, again under Li Deyu's advice, agreed, and Zhang Zhongwu soon captured Lulong's capital You Prefecture () and took over the circuit.

It is widely suspected that particularly in the rural areas it followed a regime perfected by them in which the non-party voters were virtually debarred from voting. The Keshpur rebels began questioning this. From 1998 Keshpur was caught in bloody clashes between the CPI(M) and the Trinamul Congress over control of the area.

It appears on their debut album, Gorilla (1967). It is not so much a song as a comic monologue in which the speaker introduces the musicians who ostensibly appear on the recording. The recording fades out before the emcee completes the introductions and without the \\"orchestra\\" being able to play anything more than a vamp. The piece was written by Bonzo member Vivian Stanshall, who also provides the vocal. Stanshall first introduces the seven members of the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, who are credited with their actual instruments, over a vamp that resembles Duke Ellington‚Äôs \\"C Jam Blues\\". Following that, the imaginary line-up turns toward comedy. Some of the ‚Äúmusicians‚Äù named are actual performers credited with instruments that they did not play or typically were not associated with. Others are actors, politicians and other public figures not generally linked with musical performance in any way. Some of those named will now be unfamiliar to listeners outside mid-20th century Britain, such as Billy Butlin, Val Doonican, Max Jaffa and the comic strip character Lord Snooty from The Beano. Peter Scott, credited as playing the duck call, was a well-known British ornithologist. The Rawlinsons makes reference to \\"Rawlinson‚Äôs End\\", a radio programme created by Stanshall, while Wild Man of Borneo may refer to Bonzo member Fred Munt, whose nickname was \\"Borneo\\". Also credited is a \\"session gorilla who plays the vox humana (\\"specially flown in for us\\"}. Discounting fictional characters, all of the \\"performers\\" mentioned were alive at the time of the recording, with the exceptions of Casanova and Adolf Hitler. Personnel According to Stanshall's monologue the Bonzos play the following instruments on the recording, although several of the band were multi-instrumentalists and may play other instruments as well. *\\"Legs\\" Larry Smith ‚Äî drums *Martin \\"Sam Spoons\\" Ash ‚Äî rhythm pole *Vernon Dudley Bohay- Nowell ‚Äî bass guitar *Neil Innes ‚Äî piano *Rodney Slater ‚Äî alto saxophone *Roger Ruskin Spear ‚Äî tenor saxophone *Vivian Stanshall ‚Äî trumpet, spoken vocals As well as being mentioned in Stanshall's patter as playing the ukulele, Eric Clapton actually plays the ukulele on the recording.

Arthur Rank - gong Controversies The \\"sessions gorilla\\" portion of the recording originally ran \\"And now just arriving, Quintin Hogg on pig grunt\\". Hogg was a British politician at the time. He learned of the piece prior to its release and objected to his name being used in such a context, namely the pun on his last name as \\"hog\\" (with one \\"g\\") is also another term for a pig. He managed to get Stanshall back into the studio to record the line about the sessions gorilla that is heard on the final recording. It is not known if any copies of the original version still exist.BBC article on the song Controversy also grew out of the juxtaposition of The Princess Anne with Hitler. Cultural references Vivian Stanshall is also known for appearing as the ‚ÄúMaster of Ceremonies‚Äù on Mike Oldfield‚Äôs original recording of Tubular Bells, a role which involved introducing the instruments featured in the recording, most of which were played by Oldfield.

Her surname also appears in some sources as Merichi or Merigi. Her death is assumed to be in 1764 or earlier as that was the year her husband remarried. See Dean (2001) pp. 181-82 Biography Merighi's initial career was in Italy, where for several years she was a virtuosa singer at the court of Violante Beatrice, Grand Princess of Tuscany, and sang in theatres in as well as in Venice, Parma, Turin, Mantua, Naples and her native Bologna, often in travesti roles. In Naples, she created the role of Iarba in the premiere of Domenico Sarro's Didone abbandonata (Teatro San Bartolomeo, 1 February 1724) and appeared in at least 18 other operas there. She moved to London in 1729 where for two seasons she sang in many of Handel's operas, sometimes in roles created for her by the composer (Matilda in Lotario, Rosmira in Partenope and Erissena in Poro), and sometimes in soprano parts from earlier operas adapted for her voice. She returned again to London in 1736 and in 1738 where she sang in the premieres of three more operas by Handel as well as in operas by other composers. She also sang at Handel's benefit concert at the King's Theatre in 1738. According to Winton Dean, her last opera performances appear to have been in Munich during the 1740 Carnival season.Dean (2001) pp. 181-82 After her retirement from the stage, she lived in Bologna. Merighi was married to the tenor Carlo Carlani (1716‚Äì1776). Contemporaneous accounts The Daily Courant of 2 July 1729 published names and descriptions of the new singers for Handel's 1729 season at the King's Theatre: > Mr. Handel, who is just returned from Italy, has contracted with the > following persons to perform in the Italian opera: Sig. Bernacchi, who is > esteemed the best singer in Italy; Signora Merighi, a woman of a very fine > presence, an excellent actress, and a very good singer, with a counter-tenor > voice ; Signora Strada, who hath a very fine treble voice, a person of > singular merit; Sig. Annibale Pio Fabri, a most excellent tenor and a fine > voice; his wife, performs a man's part exceedingly well; Signora Bertoldi, > who is a very fine treble voice\\".Quoted in Delany p. 184. Mary Delany, Handel's lifelong friend and supporter, was one of the few invited to the rehearsals for the 1729 season. In a letter to a friend, she wrote of his new singer: > La Merighi [...] her voice is not extraordinarily good or bad. She is tall, > and has a very graceful person with a tolerable face. She seems to be a > woman about forty; she sings easily and agreeably.Quoted in Streatfeild > (1910) p. 111 When Merighi returned for the 1736 season after an absence of several years, Delany wrote: > Merighi ‚Äî with no sound in her voice, but thundering action, a beauty with > no other merit Quoted in Streatfeild (1910) p. 139 Merighi's acting ability (and that of the castrato, Nicolo Grimaldi) was also noted by Giambattista Mancini in his 1774 Pensieri e riflessioni pratiche sopra il canto figurato: > Nicola Grimaldi, alias Cavalier Niccolino, possessed the art of recitative > and acting to such perfection that although he was very poor in other > talents and did not have a beautiful voice, he became very singular.

Features One feature of the BCDB is its \\"Top Rated\\" page which provides a listing of the top 25 animated films as voted by the registered users of the website. Ratings are shown based on top score as well as the cartoons that receive the highest number of votes. Users are given the option of rating a movie from \\"1\\" (lowest) to \\"10\\" (highest). To safeguard against attempts to skew the data, the DataBase employs data filters and a vote quota in an attempt to give an accurate Bayesian estimate. The BCDB also has a lowest-20 rated cartoons feature which, based on the same data, shows the least liked cartoons in the database. BCDB also includes a linked, online forum, where users express their opinions about cartoons, and/or ask questions about them. The forum is available to all registered users, and is actively moderated by a team of moderators and administrators. Other features include news items related to the animation industry and the recently added image gallery, which allows users to see images of various cartoon characters taken from popular films. Recognition In 2002, The San Diego Union Tribune listed BCDB as a \\"top site\\" and wrote \\"with more than 42,000 cartoons, 2,000 series[,] and 1,300 cartoon reviews, this may be one of the Internet's largest searchable databases of cartoons\\". In 2005, Apple Hot News wrote \\"The Big Cartoon Database is the place to find in depth information about any cartoon ever made\\". In 2006, it was reported by the Reference and User Services Association, in their Eighth Annual List of Best Free Reference Web Sites, that \\"The Big Cartoon Database is the definitive Web compendium for anyone interested in the history of animation.\\" The BCDB has been used as a reference by such news sources as Hartford Courant, The San Diego Union Tribune, Oakland Tribune, Beacon News, USA Today, and the Animation World Network, among others. Que's Official Internet Yellow Pages rates the site as 5 (out of 5) stars.

G. Wells' The War of the Worlds) is a 1953 American science fiction film from Paramount Pictures, produced by George Pal, directed by Byron Haskin, and starring Gene Barry and Ann Robinson. The film is an adaptation of the 1898 novel of the same name by H. G. Wells, the first of five film adaptations. It is a modern retelling of the 1897 novel, changing the setting from Victorian era-England to 1953 southern California. Earth is suddenly and unexpectedly invaded by Martians, and American scientist Clayton Forrester searches for any weakness that can stop them. The War of the Worlds won an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and went on to influence other science fiction films. In 2011, it was selected for the United States' National Film Registry in the Library of Congress, being deemed \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Plot In southern California, Dr. Clayton Forrester (Gene Barry), a well-known atomic scientist, is fishing with colleagues when a large object crashes near the town of Linda Rosa. At the impact site, he meets USC library science instructor Sylvia Van Buren (Ann Robinson) and her uncle, Pastor Matthew Collins (Lewis Martin). Later that night, a round hatch on the object unscrews and opens; a Martian weapon disintegrates the three men standing guard at the site. The United States Marine Corps surround the crash site, as reports pour in of identical cylinders landing all over the world and destroying cities. Pastor Collins attempts to make contact with the Martians but is disintegrated. The Martian war machines emerge and effortlessly defeat the military with their Heat-Ray and skeleton-beam weapons. Attempting to escape in a military spotter plane, Forrester and Sylvia crash land and hide in an abandoned farmhouse. They begin to develop closer feelings for each other just before the house is buried by yet another crashing cylinder. They encounter and dismember a Martian electronic eye on a long cable and collect a Martian blood sample when Forrester defends Sylvia with an ax. They escape just before the farmhouse is obliterated. Forrester takes the camera housing and blood sample to his team at Pacific Tech in the hope of finding a way to defeat the invaders. Many of the major world capitals are destroyed by the Martians, and the United States government makes the decision to drop an atomic bomb. The Martians' force shield, however, proves impenetrable. As the Martians advance on Los Angeles, the city is evacuated. Forrester, Sylvia, and the Pacific Tech team become separated in the chaos, and their scientific equipment is stolen or destroyed. Forrester searches for Sylvia in the city. Based on a story she had told him earlier, he guesses that she would take refuge in a church. After searching through several, he finds Sylvia among many praying survivors. Just as the Martians strike the church, their machines suddenly lose power and crash, one after another. Forrester sees one Martian expire as it tries to leave its machine. In voice-over, the film's narrator observes that while the Martians were impervious to humanity's weapons, they had \\"No resistance to the bacteria in our atmosphere to which we have long since become immune. After all that men could do had failed, the Martians were destroyed and humanity was saved by the littlest things, which God, in His wisdom, had put upon this Earth.\\" Cast Production The War of the Worlds opens with a black-and-white prologue featuring newsreel war footage and a voice-over by Paul Frees that describes the destructive technological advancements of Earthly warfare from World War I through World War II. The image then smash cuts to vivid Technicolor and the dramatic opening title card and credits. Theatrical re-release poster The story then begins with a series of color matte paintings by astronomical artist Chesley Bonestell that depict the planets of our Solar System (all except Venus). A narrator (Sir Cedric Hardwicke) offers a tour of the hostile environment of each world, eventually explaining to the audience why the Martians find our lush, green, and blue Earth the only world worthy of their scrutiny and coming invasion.Rubin 1977, pp. 4‚Äì16, 34‚Äì47. This is the first of two adaptations of Wells' classic science fiction filmed by George Pal; it is considered to be one of the great science fiction films of the 1950s.Booker 2010, p. 126. Pal originally planned for the final third of the film to be shot in the new 3D process to visually enhance the Martians' attack on Los Angeles. The plan was dropped prior to the actual production of the film. World War II stock footage was used to produce a montage of destruction to show the worldwide invasion, with armies of all nations joining together to fight the invaders. Dr. Forrester's and the other scientists' Pacific Tech (Pacific Institute of Science and Technology, actually depicted by buildings on the Paramount studio lot) has since been referenced in other films and television episodes whenever directors/writers/producers needed to depict a science-oriented California university without using a specific institution's name.Warren 1982, pp. 151‚Äì163. The city of Corona, California, was used as the shooting location of the fictitious town of Linda Rosa. St. Brendan's Catholic Church, located at 310 South Van Ness Avenue in Los Angeles, was the setting for the climactic scene where a large group of desperate people gather to pray. The rolling hills and main thoroughfares of El Sereno, Los Angeles, were also used in the film. On the commentary track of the 2005 Special Collector's DVD Edition of War of the Worlds, Robinson and Barry point out that the cartoon character Woody Woodpecker is seen in a treetop, center screen, when the first large Martian meteorite-ship crashes through the sky near the beginning of the film. Woody's creator Walter Lantz and George Pal were close friends. Pal tried to always include the Woody character out of friendship and good luck in his productions. Joe Adamson wrote years later: \\"Walter had been close friends with Pal ever since Pal had left Europe in advance of the war and arrived in Hollywood.\\"Adamson, Joe. 1985' The prototype Northrop YB-49 Flying Wing is prominently featured in the atomic bombing sequence. Pal and Haskin incorporated Northrop color footage of a YB-49 test flight, originally used in Paramount's Popular Science theatrical shorts, to show the Flying Wing's takeoff and bomb run.Howe, Tom. \\"Northrop YB-49 Flying Wing.\\" cedmagic.com. Retrieved: 25 August 2012. Differences from the Wells novel As Caroline Blake has written,Caroline G. Blake, Religion in Speculative Fiction, Ch.2, 5 the film is very different from the original novel in its attitude toward religion, as reflected especially in the depiction of clergymen as characters. \\"The staunchly secularist Wells depicted a cowardly and thoroughly uninspiring Curate, whom the narrator regards with disgust, with which the reader is invited to concur. In the film, there is instead the sympathetic and heroic Pastor Collins who dies a martyr's death. And then the film's final scene in the church, strongly emphasizing the Divine nature of Humanity's deliverance, has no parallel in the original book.\\" Pal's adaptation has many other differences from H. G. Wells' novel. The closest resemblance is probably that of the antagonists. The film's aliens are indeed Martians and invade Earth for the same reasons as those stated in the novel (the state of Mars suggests that it is becoming unable to support life, leading to the Martians' decision to try to make Earth their new home). They land in the same way, by crashing to the earth. However, the novel's spacecraft are large cylinder-shaped projectiles fired from the Martian surface from some kind of cannon, instead of the film's meteorite-spaceships; but the Martians emerge from their craft in the same way, by unscrewing a large, round hatch. They appear to have no use for humans in the film. In the novel, however, the invaders are observed \\"feeding\\" on humans by fatally transfusing their captives' blood supply directly into Martian bodies by using pipettes; there is also later speculation about the Martians eventually using trained human slaves to hunt down all remaining survivors after they have conquered Earth. In the film, the Martians do not bring their fast-growing red weed with them, but they are defeated by Earth microorganisms, as in the novel. However, they die from the effects of the microorganisms within three days of the landing of the first meteorite-ship; in the novel, the Martians die within about three weeks of their invasion of England. The Martians themselves bear no physical resemblance to the novel's Martians, who are described as bear-sized, roundish creatures with brown bodies, \\"merely heads\\", with quivering beak-like, V-shaped mouths dripping saliva; they have sixteen whip-like tentacles in two groupings of eight arranged on each side of their mouths and two large \\"luminous, disk-like eyes\\". Due to budget constraints, their film counterparts are short, reddish-brown creatures with two long, thin arms with three long, thin fingers with suction-cup tips. The Martians' head, if it can be called that, is a broad \\"face\\" at the top-front of its broad- shouldered upper torso, the only apparent feature of which is a single large eye with three distinctly colored lenses (red, blue, and green). The Martians' lower extremities, whatever they may be, are never shown. (Some speculative designs for the creature suggest the idea of three thin legs resembling their fingers, while others show them as bipeds with short, stubby legs with three- toed feet.) The film's Martian war machines do actually have more of a resemblance than they may seem at first glance. The novel's machines are 10-story-tall tripods and carry the heat-ray projector on an articulated arm connected to the front of the war machine's main body. The film's machines are shaped like manta rays, with a bulbous, elongated green window at the front, through which the Martians observe their surroundings. On top of the machine is the cobra-swan head-like heat-ray attached to a long, narrow, goose-neck extension. They can be mistaken for flying machines, but Forrester states that they are lifted by \\"invisible legs\\"; in one scene when the first machine emerges, you can see faint traces of three energy legs beneath and three sparking traces where the three energy shafts touch the burning ground. Therefore, technically speaking, the film's war machines are indeed tripods, though they are never given that designation. Whereas the novel's war machines had no protection against the British army and navy cannon fire, the film's war machines have a force field surrounding them; this invisible shield is described by Forrester as a protective blister. The Martian weaponry is also partially unchanged. The heat-ray has the very same effect as that of the novel. However, the novel's heat-ray mechanism is briefly described as just a rounded hump when first seen in silhouette rising above the landing crater's rim; it fires an invisible energy beam in a wide arc while still in the pit made by the first Martian cylinder after it crash-lands. The film's heat-ray projector when first seen is shaped like a cross between a cobra and a swan, and has a single, red pulsing \\"eye\\", which likely acts as a targeting telescope for the Martians inside their manta ray-like war machine. The novel describes another weapon, the \\"black smoke\\" used to kill all life; the war machines fire canisters containing a black smoke-powder through a bazooka-like tube accessory. When dispersed, this black powder is lethal to all life forms who breathe it. This weapon is replaced in the film by a Martian skeleton beam‚Äîgreen pulsing bursts fired from the wingtips of the manta-ray machines; these bursts break apart the sub-atomic bonds that hold matter together on anything they touch. These skeleton beams are used off-screen to obliterate several French cities. The plot of the film is very different from the novel, which tells the story of a 19th-century writer (with additional narration in later chapters by his medical-student younger brother), who journeys through Victorian London and its southwestern suburbs while the Martians attack, eventually being reunited with his wife; the film's protagonist is a California scientist who falls in love with a former college student after the Martian invasion begins. However, certain points of the film's plot are similar to the novel, from the crash-landing of the Martian meteorite-ships to their eventual defeat by Earth's microorganisms. Forrester also experiences similar events like the book's narrator: an ordeal in a destroyed house, observing an actual Martian up close, and eventually reuniting with his love interest at the end of the story. The film is given more of a Cold War theme with its use of the atomic bomb against the enemy and the mass destruction that such a global war would inflict on mankind. Special effects An effort was made to avoid the stereotypical flying saucer look of UFOs: The Martian war machines, which were designed by Al Nozaki, were instead made to be sinister-looking machines shaped like manta rays floating above the ground. Three Martian war machine props were made out of copper for the film. The same blueprints were used a decade later, sans head, to construct the alien spacecraft in the film Robinson Crusoe on Mars, also directed by Byron Haskin; that film prop was later reported melted down as part of a scrap copper recycling drive. Each Martian machine was topped with an articulated metal neck/arm, culminating in the cobra-like head, housing a single electronic eye that operated both like a periscope and as a weapon. The electronic eye also housed the Martian heat ray, which pulsed and fired red sparking beams, all accompanied by thrumming and a high-pitched clattering shriek when the ray was used. The distinctive sound effect of the weapon was created by an orchestra performing a written score, mainly through the use of violins and cellos. For many years, it was utilized as a standard ray-gun sound on children's television shows and the science-fiction anthology series The Outer Limits, particularly in the episode \\"The Children of Spider County\\". The machines also fired a pulsing green ray (referred to as a skeleton beam) from their wingtips, generating a distinctive sound, also disintegrating their targeted people; this second weapon is a replacement for the chemical weapon black smoke described in Wells' novel. This weapon's sound effect (created by striking a high tension cable with a hammer) was reused in Star Trek: The Original Series, accompanying the launch of photon torpedoes. The sound used when the Martian ships begin to move was also recycled by the original Star Trek as the sound of an overloading hand phaser. Another prominent sound effect was a chattering, synthesized echo, perhaps representing some kind of Martian sonar; it can be described as sounding like hissing electronic rattlesnakes. When the large Marine force opens fire on the Martians with everything in its heavy arsenal, each Martian machine is protected by an impenetrable force field that resembles, when briefly visible between explosions, the clear jar placed over a mantle clock, or a bell jar; cylindrical and with a hemispherical top. This effect was accomplished by the use of simple matte paintings on clear glass, which were then photographed and combined with other effects, then optically printed together during post- production. The disintegration effect took 144 separate matte paintings to create. The sound effects of the war machines' heat rays firing were created by mixing the sound of three electric guitars being recorded backwards. The Martian's scream in the farmhouse ruins was created by mixing the sound of a microphone scraping along dry ice being combined with a woman's recorded scream and then reverse-played for the sound effect mix. There were many problems trying to create the walking tripods of Wells' novel. It was eventually decided to make the Martian machines appear to float in the air on three invisible legs. To show their existence, subtle special effects downward lights were to be added directly under the moving war machines; however, in the final film, these only appear when one of the first machines can be seen rising from the Martian's landing site. It proved too difficult and dangerous to mark out the invisible legs when smoke and other effects had to be seen beneath the machines, and the effect used to create them also created a major fire hazard. In all of the subsequent scenes, however, the three invisible leg beams create small, sparking fires where they touch the ground. Quality of special effects Despite the many accolades awarded to the film, for 50 years, beginning in the late 1960s when The War of the Worlds 3-strip Technicolor prints were replaced by the easier-to-use and less expensive Eastman Color stock, the quality of the film's special effects suffered dramatically, resulting in a degradation of lighting, timing, and image resolution, causing the originally invisible wires suspending the Martian war machines to become increasingly more visible with each succeeding advance in film and video formats, leading many, including respected critics, to believe the effects were originally low quality.Miller, Thomas Kent.

The Epsom Advertiser incorporating the Epsom Observer, 25 July 1919.Jack Knox: When 400 rioting Canadian soldiers killed a British policeman The riot In the summer of 1919 the First World War had been over for over half a year, but many of the British Empire's soldiers still had not been sent home. Unhappy at the delay in being returned to Canada, the men of some Canadian regiments stationed at Woodcote Camp on Epsom Downs became increasingly restive. On 16 June 1919, Derby Day, a number of the men were at The Rifleman pub and began flirting with the wives of the locals. A minor fight broke out and two of their number, Privates MacDonald and Veinotte, were arrested. On 17 June, about 20 of their friends gathered outside the police station in Ashley Road demanding their release, while sending word back to other soldiers at the camp to come down to the town to assist them. About 400 Canadian soldiers gathered; in time, they attacked the police station, intending to release MacDonald and Veinotte. Thereafter, the 400 soldiers ran riot through Epsom, breaking windows and destroying property in a trail of destruction more than a mile and a half long.Gone But Not Forgotten , truecrimelibrary.com; accessed 21 November 2017. When the rioters stormed the police station, it was defended by 16 police officers armed with wooden truncheons. During the ensuing fighting 11 policemen were injured, and Sergeant Thomas Green, aged 51, was fatally wounded when he was hit on the head with an iron bar. He died in Epsom Hospital the next day without having regained consciousness. Police Officers guard Epsom Police Station after the riot Scotland Yard detectives arrested Allan McMaster, 30, a former blacksmith, whom they believed to be the rioters' leader. However, the Canadian soldiers refused to identify him. Despite this, McMaster and seven other soldiers were put on trial at Guildford in July, accused of rioting and manslaughter. Mr Justice Darling presided. The accused were: James Connors, 19, private, 13th Canadian Highlanders; Robert Alexander McAllan, 45, C.A.M.C.; Allan McMaster, 30, private, 3rd Canadians; Alphonse Masse, 27, C.A.M.C.; Gervase Porier, 24 C.A.M.C.; Herbert Tait, 29, gunner, 11th Division Canadians; Frank Harold Wilkie, 21, private, 102nd Battalion Canadians, and David Verex, 32, private, Canadian Forestry Corps.The Epsom Riot - A Parade at Bow Street - Canadian Sent For Trial, The Epsom Advertiser incorporating the Epsom Observer, 4 July 1919. The prosecution, which included Cecil Whiteley KC, presented a case which was so ineffectual that the four accused were quickly acquitted of manslaughter, and were found guilty only of rioting. They were sentenced to 12 months imprisonment. Within weeks they were pardoned by the Prince of Wales and returned to Canada. Back in Canada, McMaster confessed to the murder of Sergeant Green in 1929, and was detained by the Canadian police, but he was released after Scotland Yard said he had been legally dealt with by the Guildford court in relation to Green's death. This left the case officially unsolved. In 2010, We Are Not Manslaughterers by Martin Knight was published. The book contended the mysterious death of a Canadian soldier in Epsom days after that of Sgt. Green was a revenge killing.

It has 104 members (81 national sports federations and 23 partner organisations), to which some two million people belong, practising sports in about 19,000 clubs. Swiss Olympic has its headquarters in the House of Sports in Ittigen near Bern. Swiss Olympic represents Olympic as well as non-Olympic sports and is a non-profit organisation. The big sports federations are divided into regional and cantonal associations. Former National Council member J√ºrg Stahl has been President since 2017. Roger Schnegg has been Director since January 2012.  History  Since 1 January 1997, the Olympic movement of Switzerland has been backed by the Swiss Olympic Association (Swiss Olympic - known as Schweizerischer Olympischer Verband up to 2001). Swiss Olympic came into being from the merging of the Swiss Sports Association (Schweizerischer Landesverband f√ºr Sport ‚Äì SLS) and the Swiss Olympic Committee (SOC). When the organisation was founded, the National Committee for Elite Sport (NCES) was integrated into it. The SOC had been set up in 1912 and admitted by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) the same year. Prior to that, there were no official delegations from Switzerland at the Olympic Games. However, individual athletes competed in them independently on a regular basis. One example is the gymnast Louis Zutter, who was the only person from Switzerland to compete as a private individual in the Olympic Games in 1896. To date, the Winter Olympic Games have been held twice in Switzerland. In 1928 and 1948, the Winter Olympic Games took place in St. Moritz each time.  Organisation  Swiss Olympic is an association and umbrella organisation of 81 Swiss sports federations. The so-called Sports Parliament functions as the highest body. This is the assembly of the member federations, at which the latter have voting rights according to their size. An Executive Board, consisting of the President, the Vice-President, 14 other members and the Swiss members of the IOC, is the leading organ of the umbrella organisation, representing Swiss Olympic externally. An administrative office is in charge of the administration. In addition, the Disciplinary Chamber for Doping Cases and the Athletes‚Äô Commission are also affiliated to Swiss Olympic.  Objectives  Swiss Olympic defines its four core objectives as follows: * to support and strengthen the member federations and thereby every facet of Swiss sport * to spread and embed the Olympic values (excellence, respect and friendship) in society, particularly in schools * to create the best possible preconditions for achieving sporting success at international level * to represent the interests of the private law sphere in Swiss sport and stand up for its recognition in society  Olympic missions  Swiss Olympic is responsible for various Olympic missions and their delegations. As well as sending delegations to the Summer and Winter Olympic Games, Swiss Olympic also sends them to the Youth Olympic Games, the European Games, the European Youth Olympic Festival and to the ANOC World Beach Games. In addition, Swiss Olympic also organises the Talent Treff Tenero (3T) ‚Äì a meeting of talented young athletes ‚Äì twice a year. Together with the responsible federations, Swiss Olympic lays down the relevant selection criteria for the individual major sporting events and then, in a further process, selects the qualifying athletes. In order to be able to offer the athletes the best possible environment at the competition venue, Swiss Olympic takes care of all the organisational aspects in the run-up. During the course of this, the accommodation and the necessary training infrastructure at the host destination are organised, and suitable flights are booked for the whole delegation.  Federation support  Swiss Olympic works together with the individual federations on a targeted and individual basis in order to improve the chances of record performances at the Olympic as well as Paralympic Games, World and European Championships, World Games, and other competitions with the highest status. The service-level agreements between Swiss Olympic and the member federations are each concluded for a term of four years for the purpose of increasing planning certainty in the federations. The agreements stipulate which financial contributions and services Swiss Olympic provides for the spheres of general federation management, ethics and competitive sport, and which responsibilities the federation assumes in return. The various types of sport are classified from Group 1 to Group 5. Swiss Olympic uses this classification as a control instrument in order to define the scope of the financial support. Those sports for which the federations count on a specific support framework for competitive sport, and which are geared towards successful participation in the Olympic Games, Paralympics, and World and European Championships (including Universiade und World Games) are taken into consideration. The different sports are assessed on the basis of the results achieved, the medium-term potential, the implementation of their support framework and their national importance. As well as financial assistance, Swiss Olympic also supports the federations with expertise in the fields of ethics, federation planning, training and sports coach training. In addition, there are various Swiss Olympic Cards for the athletes and officials. Moreover, Swiss Olympic helps to advance the vocational training of the sportsmen and women with various programmes, and certifies medical institutions which are especially geared towards elite athletes.  Ethics Charter ‚Äì Nine principles for Swiss sport  The Olympic values ‚Äì Excellence, Friendship and Respect ‚Äì form the basis for fair and sustainable sport worldwide. The Ethics Charter of Swiss Olympic and of the Federal Office of Sport (FOSPO) is founded on these values. Its aim is to contribute to sport which is fair and free from discrimination and cheating. The Ethics Charter is a mandatory and integral part of the statutes of every Swiss Olympic member federation. The member federations are, accordingly, under an obligation to designate a person responsible for ethics. He or she ensures that the Charter is implemented within the sports federation and takes care of the ethical challenges of the federation. The Code of Conduct drawn up by Swiss Olympic and the various programmes are important aids in this. They show how the Olympic values and the Ethics Charter are applied in the best possible way in the everyday life of the federation and at sporting events.  Swiss Olympic Card  The Swiss Olympic Card is a distinction awarded to athletes ‚Äì on the one hand, for competition results achieved internationally and, on the other, for existing potential. The Swiss Olympic Card comes in five different versions ‚Äì according to performance level. It is awarded annually in consultation with the respective member federation responsible. Depending on the variant, the Card offers access to special services and reductions.

It was created on May 22, 2007. History On May 22, 2007 in Vilnius, Lithuania it was announced about creation of the Belarusian Committee on protection of prisoners‚Äô rights ¬´OVER BARRIER¬ª (BCPPR ¬´OVER BARRIER¬ª) The decision to organize the constituent assembly on territory of Lithuania was made due impossibility of organization registration in Belarus. 20 citizens of Belarus who in different situations faced problems and imperfection of penitentiary systems of Belarus took part in the constituent assembly. The organizing committee on creation of the BCPPR ¬´OVER BARRIER¬ª included former political prisoners Tsimafei Dranchuk and Dzmitry Kasperovich, public activists Veronika Vygovskaya and Christina Shatikova, and other participants of the constituent assembly. The constituent assembly has charged Tsimafei Dranchuk and Veronika Vygovskaya to prepare necessary documents for registration of the BCPPR ¬´OVER BARRIER¬ª in the Republic of Lithuania. Leaders of BCPPR \\"Over Barrier\\" *Tsimafei Dranchuk *Zmicier Kaspiarovich *Veranika Vygovskaya The aims of creation Creation of the BCPPR ¬´OVER BARRIER¬ª is caused by absence of working in Belarus human rights organizations that deal with a problem of Belarusian prisoners on a large scale, and concentrates exclusively on protection of the rights of political prisoners, which is minimal in comparison with total arrested. Thus practice shows that the scale of violation of the rights of ordinary prisoners is bigger, but none of them has opportunity to receive a high-grade legal support, to draw attention of the public to the problem and to achieve justice. The priority purpose of the Committee is attraction of public attention to the problems of prisoners in Belarus, whose rights are violated, with no discrimination, whether in what of places of correction or restriction of freedom they are, are they a victim of a miscarriage of justice or punished according to the law. It‚Äôs clear, how difficult is for our society to understand motives and acts of people, which have ended up in jails. Many prisoners are not classical victims with the pure past and clear future. They have violated the law, but for it have already had severe punishment, having lost freedom, appearing isolated from a society, relatives and friends, having lost many rights. But they also as other citizens of our country have rights guaranteed by the UN Declaration of human rights and the Constitution of Belarus. Nobody has rights to torture, to beat, to kill, to humiliate human advantage, to violate none. More over lawful representatives of the society on behalf of law enforcement bodies should not turn punishment into crime. Also, the purposes of the Committee is distribution of the information on facts of violation of the rights of prisoners irrespective of, whether they are suspected, accused or convicted; creation of monitoring of violation of the rights of prisoners in Belarus; contribution to restoration of justice in the attitude to illegally convicted or those whose rights were broken. On the most provoking violations BCPPR organizes distribution of press releases and achieves reaction of representatives responsible for observance of legality.

Self-Mutilation Controversy Critics of this ritual often cite the cut that the practitioner makes on their chest as self- mutilation. The practitioner does not have to slice into their skin and draw large amounts of blood. Lon Milo DuQuette wrote that \\"nowhere is it indicated that pain, scarring, or injury is a required element of the ceremony.\\" The practitioner need only scratch their skin lightly and increase the pressure enough for a tiny droplet of blood. There are also those who consider doing the ritual astrally (within their minds). Some consider this a safer and more practical alternative to marking their skin. Although the legitimacy of this method is questionable, it is still to be considered. Usage of Blood/Bodily Fluids Although the Cakes of Light are famous for sometimes having semen or menstrual blood within them, using these bodily fluids is not a mandatory part of their creation. Within The Book of the Law, the instructions for the making of a Cake of Light are found: For perfume mix meal & honey & thick leavings of red wine: then oil of Abramelin and olive oil, and afterward soften & smooth down with rich fresh blood. The best blood is of the moon, monthly: then the fresh blood of a child, or dropping from the host of heaven: then of enemies; then of the priest or of the worshippers: last of some beast, no matter what. (AL.III.23-4). Various types of blood are given as acceptable within a Cake of Light. \\"Of the moon\\" refers to monthly menstrual blood. \\"Of a child\\" refers to fluid from sexual intercourse. \\"From the host of heaven\\" refers to semen. \\"Of enemies; then of the priest or of the worshippers\\" is self-explanatory. \\"Last of some beast\\" refers to animal blood; the least controversial since many foods are made with the substance. Although the first three options are used for their higher value (and notoriety), any option is acceptable.

It was released in Japan on August 7, 2008 and in North America on August 3, 2010. The game was not released in Europe. Gameplay Two monsters fighting against each other in a tournament The game, taking place in the BOMBA region, involves raising, fighting, and breeding monsters. The main character is never seen on screen, but always talks to his apprentice, Cleo, directly. The player chooses his actions and choices through menu options. Creating Monsters There are two primary methods for creating monsters: drawing pictures in the Magic Field using the touchscreen, and reciting an Incantation using the microphone. Other methods include combining two existing monsters to create a new monster as well as an additional unrevealed method. New to the combination process is the \\"-ish\\" or \\"modoki\\" monster, a glitch monster whose purpose is to give you a monster when you attempt combinations that are not in the game, and appear as a light blue untextured version of the normal model, and appear as the last monster in each monster's entries in the monster encyclopedia, using the ???-subtype normally used by special monsters. Fighting Monsters The way you make money, and gain ranks, is by having your monster fight in tournaments. In a fight, your monster starts with a fixed amount of guts, which is basically energy to spend on the moves they know. You can control the monster yourself, or let them fight on their own as they do when they get into a battle in the wild. Moves can be done in one of three ranges. You can move forward or backward on the battlefield to toggle between the ranges. If you get in very close, you can also push the opponent away from you. A major change from the previous games is that you are able to use the touchscreen to move your monster forward or backwards, as well as to order it to attack. Monsters Various monsters which have been left out of previous games since Monster Rancher 2 will be making a return including Monol and Gali. There are currently 272 monsters known in the game, including the glitch type monsters. The main breeds are Abyss, Beaclon, Baku, Centaur, Color Pandora, Dragon, Ducken, Durahan, Falco, Gali, Golem, Hare, Henger, Joker, Lesione, Mew, Mocchi, Monol, Naga, Ogyo, Pancho, Phoenix, Piroro, Pixie, Plant, Suezo, Tiger, Xenon, and Zan. Development The game was announced on May 23, 2008 and would be released in Japan as Monster Farm DS 2: Yomigaeru! Master Breeder Densetsu. At that time no localization for the first game, Monster Farm DS had been announced for North America. This gave rise to speculation that both games would not be localized in North America at all which would be a first for the series since every past game in the series had been localized with all of the past portable titles: Monster Rancher Advance and Monster Rancher Advance 2 being released in North America. However, on November 10, 2009 this speculation was proven untrue when it was announced that Monster Farm DS 2 would be released in North America as Monster Rancher DS with the first DS game, Monster Farm DS not being localized in favor of its sequel. This announcement came a year after its original Japanese release and came as a surprise to many fans who had lost hope. Reception The game received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of one six, one seven, and two eights for a total of 29 out of 40.

The interferometer consists of a long plate of glass or quartz, with faces that are polished accurately flat and parallel. Light bounces back and forth inside the plate, striking the faces at an angle just below the critical angle as it propagates along. 500px Because of the steep angle of incidence, nearly all of the light is reflected, but a tiny fraction leaks out on each bounce.

However, it is a Hungarian School, since the 97% of the population of the village is Hungarian. History It was in 1886, when the first parish school opened in Nagyszelmenc. It was very significant for the village since till that time the parents had to take their children into the school of Ruszka or Pal√°gy which were faith-based schools. The first school was made of wood and it had only one classroom. In 1906, a two class roomed school was built. In 1945, the number of children decreased since the new state border cut down the village into 2 sides, and from that time one side, Kisszelmenc, became the part of Ukraine and the education was on Slovak language. But the parents did not want to take their children into the Slovak school which influenced the school standard badly. In 1950, the education became run in Hungarian again. As a result of this, the numbers of children began to increase; therefore it was necessary to build a new, bigger school. The new school was accomplished in the school year of 1956/57. From that time that building is the school building of Nagyszelmenc. After 1989, the life of the school changed, too. It became more democratic and teachers got more freedom, and they also got the opportunity to show their creativity and suitability in the field of teaching. The teaching of English language and bible was launched in this year, as well. In 2002, the local government became the supporter of the school and they began to renovate the institution. The School was appraised into Dob√≥ Istv√°n Hungarian Elementary School in the school year of 2005/2006 after the proposal of the new director, PaedDr. Hack L√°szl√≥. The school has three twin schools: * Elementary School of Pal√°gykomor√≥c, in Ukraine * Elementary School of M√°d, in Hungary * Elementary School of V√°mos√∫jfalu, in Hungary Extracurricular activities Student groups and activities include literary study group, conversationalist study group, ‚Äùskillful hands‚Äù study group, dance study group, computer studies, and tourism study group. The attendance of the school traditions is one of the most important resort of the school's badinage. Therefore, the school deliberately cultivates, keeps and improves the different traditions. It is very important for the school to organize various public programs which can develop the community. The traditions held in the school: \\\\- Santa Claus \\\\- Christmas \\\\- Carnival \\\\- St. Valentine's Day \\\\- The Day of Children \\\\- Graduating \\\\- 'Mums and Dads you have to come' 'Mums and Dads you have to come' is a special tradition of the school. It is held after the graduation ceremony among the children with their parents and the teachers with their family. There are a lot of playful competitions, football matches, driving, archery and other sports for the children where they play with their parents. There is a goulash cooking race as well from which everybody can eat after the races.

Beginning in 1981 with Egleston Children‚Äôs Hospital (which later merged with Scottish Rite Children's Hospital), it is held on the first Saturday in December, which is also the second weekend after Thanksgiving. 2011 Nielsen estimates of TV viewing audience and crowd attendance together exceeds 500,000. With floats, giant helium-filled balloons and marching bands, the Children's Christmas Parade is the largest holiday parade in the Southeast. The parade is free to the public, but bleacher seats can be purchased on the CHoA website. It is aired live from 10:30 AM EST until noon on WSB-TV 2.1 in HDTV, previously after a half-hour pre-show (until 2010) about the children at the hospital. It is re-run again on Christmas Day. Parade sponsors include Wells Fargo, Macy's, Geico, Coca-Cola, SunTrust, Fidelity Bank, Georgia's Own Credit Union, Aarons, Publix, KidsRKids, Ringling Bros, Atlanta Peach Movers, Foresters Insurance, and Southwest Airlines. In its earliest years, it was sponsored by Davison's, one of the three major regional department stores based in Atlanta until they were eliminated by Macy's. The parade is preceded by Breakfast with Santa, featuring a buffet breakfast with Mr. and Mrs. Claus and an array of cartoon characters and mascots in live form.

The new parade route (shown left) will start at Peachtree Street and 16th Street, in front of the High Museum of Art, and continue for , ending at Peachtree Street and 5th Street. Festival of Trees The parade also served as the opening event for the nine-day Festival of Trees, also benefiting CHoA, and originally held at the Georgia World Congress Center. Even though the Festival of Trees left its longtime home in 2007, the Children's Christmas Parade remained in downtown Atlanta continuing a nearly three-decade Atlanta tradition. The festival, which started in 1979, was canceled in 2009, after having been drastically reduced in previous years.

State highway 9 by-passes the center of Randolph, which can be accessed by turning onto Randolph Loop, County Road 188. Mostly an agriculture and timber community, there are many farms, sawmills, and even a cotton gin owned by BHF Farms located there. Also, there is a large Amish community nearby, the only one in the deep south. Randolph High School was opened in 1937. RHS provided education for all students for grades 1 through 12. Basketball was the main sport and athletes participated in track and field also. The sports were limited because of the small size of the school, although they did create a football team circa 1965. The mascot for RHS was a \\"Rambler\\" which was represented by a line sketch of a tramp with his pack slung over his shoulder on a stick. Randolph High School was closed in 1971 due to school consolidations. The building remained until 2009 when the owner had it demolished brick by brick by Amish workers using a horse and cart. The stone building which was the home economics/agriculture center for Randolph High School still exists and has been used as a Community Center for the community of Randolph. The Original Post Office is located at the junction of Randolph Loop (CR 188) and Topsy Rd., (CR 855). \\"Randolph Day\\" is held on the first Saturday in October at the Community Center. Anyone who ever attended RHS, whether they graduated from RHS or not, meets at the Community Center. It is a social event where those who have moved away catch up on community events and the activities of their fellow Ramblers, and perhaps meet a classmate they have not seen for 30 years. People bring food and have a meal together. After lunch people group together by class and stand up class by class to let everyone else know who is there from what year.

Puck Aug 23, 1899, by J. S. Pughe A political cartoon depicting Queen Victoria (Britain), Kaiser Wilhelm II (Germany), Tsar Nicholas II (Russia), Marianne (France) and a samurai (Japan) dividing China. The century of humiliation, also known as the hundred years of national humiliation, is the term used in China to describe the period of intervention and subjugation of the Chinese Empire and the Republic of China by Western powers, Russia and Japan in between 1839 and 1949. The term arose in 1915, in the atmosphere of rising Chinese nationalism opposing the Twenty-One Demands made by the Japanese government and their acceptance by Yuan Shikai, with the Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) and Chinese Communist Party both subsequently popularizing the characterization. History Chinese nationalists in the 1920s and 1930s dated the Century of Humiliation to the mid-19th century, on the eve of the First Opium War amidst the political unraveling of Qing China that followed. Defeats by foreign powers cited as part of the Century of Humiliation include: * Defeat in the First Opium War (1839‚Äì1842) by the British * The unequal treaties (in particular Nanking, Whampoa, Aigun and Shimonoseki) * Defeat in the Second Opium War (1856‚Äì1860) and the sacking of the Old Summer Palace by British and French forces. * Signed the Treaty of Aigun (1858) and Treaty of Peking (1860) during the Second Opium War, which ceded Outer Manchuria to Russia. * Defeat in the Sino- French War (1884-1885), losing the suzerainty over Vietnam and the influence in Indochina peninsula. * Defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894‚Äì1895) by Japan * The Eight-Nation Alliance invasion to suppress the Boxer uprising (1899‚Äì1901) and impose reparations in excess of the government's annual tax revenue. * British expedition to Tibet (1903‚Äì1904)\\"China Seizes on a Dark Chapter for Tibet\\", by Edward Wong, The New York Times, August 9, 2010 (August 10, 2010 p.

In many cases, China was forced to pay large amounts of reparations, open up ports for trade, lease or cede territories (such as Outer Manchuria and parts of Outer Northwest China to the Russian Empire, Jiaozhou Bay to Germany, Hong Kong to Great Britain, Zhanjiang to France, and Taiwan and Dalian to Japan) and make various other concessions of sovereignty to foreign \\"spheres of influence\\", following military defeats.

End of humiliation When or whether the Century has ended has been open to different interpretations. Both Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong declared the end of the Century of Humiliation in the aftermath of World War II, with Chiang promoting his wartime resistance to Japanese rule and China's place among the Big Four in the victorious Allies in 1945, while Mao declared it with the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949. Extraterritorial jurisdiction was abandoned by the United Kingdom and the United States in 1943. Chiang Kai-shek forced the French to hand over all their concessions back to Chinese control after World War II. The end of the Century was similarly declared in the repulsion of UN forces in the Korean War, the 1997 reunification with Hong Kong, the 1999 reunification with Macau, and even the hosting of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Implications The usage of the Century of Humiliation in the Chinese Communist Party's historiography and modern Chinese nationalism, with its focus on the \\"sovereignty and integrity of [Chinese] territory\\", has been invoked in incidents such as the US bombing of the Chinese Belgrade embassy, the Hainan Island incident, and protests for Tibetan independence along the 2008 Beijing Olympics torch relay. Some analysts have pointed to its use in deflecting foreign criticism of human rights abuses in China and domestic attention from issues of corruption, while bolstering its territorial claims and general economic and political rise. Commentary and Criticism Jane E. Elliott criticized the allegation that China refused to modernize or was unable to defeat Western armies as simplistic, noting that China embarked on a massive military modernization in the late 1800s after several defeats, buying weapons from Western countries and manufacturing their own at arsenals, such as the Hanyang Arsenal during the Boxer Rebellion. In addition, Elliott questioned the claim that while Chinese society was traumatized by the Western victories, as many Chinese peasants (90% of the population at that time) living outside the concessions continued about their daily lives, uninterrupted and without any feeling of \\"humiliation\\". Historians have judged the Qing dynasty's vulnerability and weakness to foreign imperialism in the 19th century to be based mainly on its maritime naval weakness while it achieved military success against Westerners on land, the historian Edward L. Dreyer said that \\"China's nineteenth-century humiliations were strongly related to her weakness and failure at sea. At the start of the First Opium War, China had no unified navy and not a sense of how vulnerable she was to attack from the sea. British navy forces sailed and steamed wherever they wanted to go. In the Arrow War (1856‚Äì60), the Chinese had no way to prevent the Anglo-French navy expedition of 1860 from sailing into the Gulf of Zhili and landing as near as possible to Beijing. Meanwhile, new but not exactly modern Chinese armies suppressed the midcentury rebellions, bluffed Russia into a peaceful settlement of disputed frontiers in Central Asia, and defeated the French forces on land in the Sino- French War (1884‚Äì85). But the defeat at sea, and the resulting threat to steamship traffic to Taiwan, forced China to conclude peace on unfavorable terms.\\"Edward L.

It is also set in the historical context of the Amarna period of ancient Egypt.  Series description  Prophet Joseph is a Persian-language mini-series originally broadcast in 2008, which tells the story of prophet Yusuf (or Joseph) according to the Islamic tradition. Realistic depictions of everyday life are represented. Each episode in the series begins with a poly- phonic recitation of the first four verses (ayah) of the chapter (surah) on Yusuf. The 45 episodes of the series are replete with themes on filial love, personal journey through life (within family and on one's own), personal character, submission, prayer, prophethood, idolatry, monotheism, loyalty, betrayal, carnal desires, nature of various kinds of love, separation, abandonment, slavery, social organizations at various levels, nature of political authority, governance, strategy, various ideologies (and their implications), anticipation, and finally, forgiveness and salvation. The movie meanders through the existential lives of three principal characters (Yusuf, Zuleikha and Ya'qub) with dozens of other major and minor characters. The story in the series starts in the south of Babylon, in the second millennium BC, depicting Ya'qub's battle against idolatry (of Ishtar) in Mesopotamia and the miraculous birth of Yusuf.  Production  The 16-DVD distribution from Soroush.tv contains a bonus, last DVD describing the making of the movie, including interviews with many of the production crew and a number of assistants to the director. In this DVD and subsequent interviews, the director, Farajollah Salahshoor, gives his production account, as follows: * The preparation of the script took between three and four years. * The first conceptual draft of about 27 pages ended up in a final scene plan and script draft running about 5000 pages long. * Besides the sources available in Persian, hundreds of pages were translated from Arabic and English. * The movie set was spread over three mock cities built in space of about 35,000 square meters. * In these sources, Salahshour emphasized that without such a concerted effort on completing the script, making the movie within the budget would have been impossible. The writing crew included the director, a head of research with multiple assistants and an artistic adviser. Upon completion, the script was also reviewed by a 5-person committee composed of experts in the arts as well as production crew to ensure quality. * About 3000 actors were tested and 200 were selected. The selection involved team work. * Every team included consultants and leads. Consultants played a constructive role. * The movie was made with more than 1000 clothing elements and 10 trucks of accessories. Salahshoor describes his reasons for making the movie in an interview with a Shia TV station, with a concurrent translation into English. Distribution The series, dubbed in English, can be viewed on Iran's iFilm movie network. The original series, in Persian, can also be obtained in a 16-DVD, two-box set from its official distributor, Soroush Multimedia Company of Iran, Soroush.tv. First 15 DVDs contain 3 episodes each. Last DVD contains 3 episodes on the making of the series.  Available Languages  The movie was filmed in Persian. The Persian is of the classical \\"Dastoori\\" kind (as opposed to the shortened and inflected vernacular). Dastoori Persian has been used in Persian poetry and prose since around the 10th century. It has been dubbed into Arabic in Al-Kawthar TV and there is also another version with English subtitles, which has been and is currently being broadcast on IRIB. An Azerbaijani dubbed version licensed by CineSalam Production aired on Space TV. In 2011, Televizija Sarajevo added subtitles in Bosnian. It is currently aired on TVSA, as well as NTVIC Kakanj (mostly during the holy month of Ramadan on a yearly basis). In Pakistan, there is an Urdu dubbing available. Its Hindi-Urdu dubbed version named \\"Prophet Yousuf\\" was telecast in India on Channel WIN, starting from 19 June 2015. A Bengali dubbed version has also been telecast in SA TV of Bangladesh from 27 November 2016. A Turkish dubbed version was aired on Kanal 7. A reasonably dubbed version in English can also be found on YouTube. Reception Given that the series is quite long and the original language is in Persian, authoritative reviews in English have been scant. The number of views of various dubbed versions indicate some popularity among viewers. The trailer to the version of the series dubbed in English has been seen more than 350 thousand times on YouTube as of the second quarter of 2017. The first of the series, dubbed in English, and available on YouTube shows 300 thousand views as of the second quarter of 2017. The last (45th) episode in the same version (dubbed in English) shows about 125 thousand views as of the second quarter of 2017. Controversies Some scholars in Egypt's Al Azhar theological school have been reported by a Saudi-owned television station to have advocated the banning of Yusuf in Egypt. The director's daughter who grew up in a religious family criticized her father's work publicly, she believes that promotion of polygamy is planned by IRIB in Islamic Republic of Iran. (Iran TV.)Salahshur's daughter: \\"Polygamy promotion is planned in TV.\\" Association of Iranian Women magazine. Revised on May 15, 2009. She said, \\"‚Ä¶ we are not monitoring anyone and everyone has his personal interpretation.\\" She added, \\"I, as a normal audience, without considering my relation with the director, am very worried about the youths of this country and how the religion is defined for them, worried about the future of this generation, religion, morality and the Quran. What should youths choose?\\" Salhashoor commented, \\"Polygamy had existed in past religions and theological schools. If for some reasons it has been changed is due to the modern world. The prophets and the Prophet's predecessors had second and third wives. It had been in the past and in many Islamic countries, there is still this culture though some Shiites want to revise it. There was polygamy in the past, I could not ignore the fact to please the feminists, again I emphasize that we do not promote polygamy. It is not our intention we just express a historical document.\\"\\"Network of Iran - the Prophet Joseph is not made to advertise Ahmadinejad.\\" Institute of press. Revised on May 15, 2009.

H. Reynolds Memorial Nature Preserve Reynolds Nature Preserve is a tract of protected forest located in Morrow, Georgia, United States. The nature preserve is owned and operated by Clayton County Parks and Recreation. The park has three miles (5 km) of hiking trails, a Civil War era farm, native plants path, heritage garden, wildlife ponds, native azaleas, a wildflower field, and an interpretive center. History Huie Barn, circa 1867 Robert T.S. Huie was believed to have purchased the property that is now the Reynolds Nature Preserve around the time of the Civil War. Any history before this time was burned at the courthouse in Jonesboro, GA during Sherman's March to the Sea. The main farmhouse was originally constructed with four rooms, two upstairs and two downstairs with a chimney in the center. After the war Robert Huie added another fireplace, rooms, porches, and an attic. In the latter half of the 1920s the ever-growing naturalist, self-taught lawyer William Reynolds had purchased the property as his personal nature preserve. The Judge was known for giving tours of the preserve in his Cadillac on what are hiking trails today. At the time of his purchase there were two barns, a springhouse, spring box, corn crib, two tenant farmhouses, and the main farmhouse (closed to the public). Several of these structures or their remains still stand today. Taking advantage of several springs on the land, the Judge constructed the five ponds during the 1930s. In 1976 Judge Reynolds donated to the Clayton County government for preservation. Clayton County is the third smallest county in Georgia and the tenth most populated. The county received a federal grant from the Lands and Conservation Fund in 1979 to help provide funds to construct piers, bridges, a pavilion, and the interpretive center. The Reynolds Boards of Trustees purchased an additional in 1997 along Jesters Creek.

TSM is designed to be used by any and all teams within an enterprise including (but not limited to) sales, production, administration, IT, finance and management teams. Over 60% of organisations across the world covering private and public sector organisations are now service-based.The World Factbook Physical product enterprises can have the majority of their teams involved in performing service activities, mostly the provision of internal services to other teams, referred to as internal customers, with the minority of teams involved in the control of physical products and materials. For those enterprises whose purpose is to provide physical products, the competitive differentiator is frequently around the way they deliver services, around and in addition to the products. Today we live in a ‚Äòservice world‚Äô and so we need to have routine ways of delivering and developing services and deploy them by and to teams throughout an enterprise. Use Team service management pulls together and integrates a number of established management methods and techniques in an open source framework for any team to use without reference to consultants. It is intended to complement process centric frameworks notably ITIL and ITSM where management disciplines and the associated processes are defined, but the people and team working aspects are not fully considered. Components TSM integrates the following methods and techniques: Action-centered leadership, from John Adair ‚Äì to make sure teams work well together, ACL ensures 3 dimensions: the team, the task and the individual are in balance and effective. TSM turns 'Task' into service and adds management and leadership to the model, and renames it team dynamics.action centered leadership, (john adair's action-centred leadership model) Team lifecycle from Bruce Tuckman ‚Äì to assess and improve the maturity of teams.

EFQM, the European Forum for Quality Management ‚Äì to ensure that team result and team enablers objectives and capabilities are effective and in unison. TSM defines 4 result domains of customer results, finance results, regulatory results and service results, and then ensures the 5 enabler domains are supportive of the getting the results the team needs. The TSM enabler capabilities that are: people, process and technology, along with knowledge and suppliers.http://www.proveandimprove.org/new/tools/efqm.php Balanced scorecard, Kaplan and Norton's strategic planning method ‚Äì to manage team strategy, objectives, performance and improvement initiatives. TSM uses the standard balanced scorecard to set top down objectives for each team and creates a team strategy for operating and improving the team with planned initiatives. TSM extends the four standard balanced scorecard perspectives to the nine of EFQM: It extends the two result domains of customer and finance to four by adding service results and regulatory results; and extends the two enabler domains of people and process to the five by adding technology, knowledge and suppliers. Personal performance and development plans (PDPs) to ensure that individual performance and Improvement are an integral part of the team's performance and improvement. TSM ensures that individual's performance and development plans are linked to the team's balanced scorecard. So individuals are allocated their share of responsibility for achieving the team's result and enabler objectives, and are allocated their share of ownership of the team's Improvement Initiatives. The PDCA cycle Deming‚Äôs Plan‚Äìdo‚Äìcheck‚Äìact (PDCA) to ensure team and individuals improvement is incremental and continual. TSM takes the Improvement Initiatives and breaks them into bite sized chunks so that they can be delivered incrementally over a short period of time. The chunks or increments are subject to the PDCA cycle where the increment is first planned, then done, then checked, and then finally but most importantly the lessons learned the results achieved assessed so that the next increment the next/ subsequent PDCA cycles can be planned or re-planned to move most effectively to achieving the overall outcome for the Initiative. Performance management to ensure that all the activities of each team are transparent and linked to the services delivered and the improvements needed. TSM ensures that work and performance of the team is recognised, recorded and analysed and acted upon. It ensures that resource use, and service effectiveness are both recorded and that issues encountered in undertaking the work of the team are recorded and acted upon feeding in more improvement initiatives into the appropriate point of the TSM framework.

According to the Handbook of Texas, the community had an estimated population of 61 in 2000. Geography Grassland lies on the level plains of the Llano Estacado in West Texas. It is situated at the junction of Farm Roads 212 and 1313 in east central Lynn County, approximately two miles south of U.S. Highway 380 and two miles west of the Garza County line. History The community was founded in 1888 and grew up around a ranch owned by Enos Seeds and his brother, Thomas. A post office was established at the site on January 12, 1889. It remained operational until May 7, 1900. During the early 1900s, former ranch lands were divided into smaller plots and sold for farming and other agricultural purposes. Grassland School District No. 21 was created in 1916 to serve local students. That same year, Grassland Methodist Church was organized. The community's status as a hub of religious activities was furthered with the organization of two more churches, the Central Baptist Church of Grassland and Grassland Nazarene during the early 1920s. A total of 76 people were living in Grassland by 1930. That number grew to roughly 200 in 1940. On September 26, 1940, high school students from Grassland and several other rural districts were sent to Tahoka, following the trend of school consolidation found throughout the state at the time. The consolidation process was completed on June 26, 1953, when Grassland's school closed and all students were bussed to nearby Tahoka. The community managed to maintain its peak population of approximately 200 through 1960s, but a marked decline took place during that decade. By 1970, Grassland home to around 60 residents.

The Vainakh tower architecture is a characteristic feature of ancient and medieval architecture of Chechnya and Ingushetia. Vainakh architecture was also distributed to north-eastern Georgia (Dartlo, Tusheti) by Chechen builders and are as well conceptually similar to Svan towers. Some towers were used as dwellings, others had a military purpose; some combined both functions. History The oldest fortifications in the North Caucasus date from the 3rd millennium BC. The oldest remains of buildings with the characteristics of Vainakh towers date from the 1st century AD, and can already be distinguished into residential and military types. Construction greatly increased in the 12th and 13th centuries.Vainakh tower architecture and construction techniques reached their peak in the 15th‚Äì17th centuries.Lecha Ilyasov. The Diversity of the Chechen Culture: From Historical Roots to the Present. . General features Vovnushki tower complex. Typical Vainakh towers were built on a square base, ranging from 6 to 12 m wide and 10 to 25 m high, depending on the function. The walls were built of stone blocks, possibly with lime, clay-lime, or lime-sand mortar. The walls were inclined inwards and their thickness decreased on higher floors. The towers were built on hard rock. Vainakh towers used to be sparingly decorated with religious or good-wishing petrographs, such as solar signs, depictions of the author‚Äôs hands, or animals. The construction of a tower, whether residential or military, was accompanied by rituals. Songs and folk tales emphasise the role of the \\"master builder\\", who, according to tradition, would direct a group of assistants who did the actual work. Some of these masters had their names preserved‚Äîsuch as Diskhi, associated in the local tradition to the military tower of Vougi, and Yand of the Ingush settlement Erzi. Some Chechen villages, such as Bavloi, specialized in tower building. Legends ascribe to the master builder the honourable and extremely dangerous task of erecting the tsIurku stone that topped the step pyramidal roof of a military tower. A ladder was tied to a machicolation on the outside for the master to reach the roof. It cost many masters their life. In case of success, the client gave the master a bull. The construction of a family tower cost the household 50 to 60 cows. Ivan Shcheblykin claimed that the tower builders did not need any scaffolding,–©–µ–±–ª—ã–∫–∏–Ω –ò. –ü. –ò—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤–æ –∏–Ω–≥—É—à–µ–π –≤ –ø–∞–º—è—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–∞—Ö –º–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–π –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä—ã // –ò–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–∏—è –ò–Ω–≥—É—à—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –Ω–∞—É—á–Ω–æ-–∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –∏–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ç–∞ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –∏ –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä—ã. –í–ª–∞–¥–∏–∫–∞–≤–∫–∞–∑, 1928. –í—ã–ø. 1. Page 282. and many researchers make that assumption. However, he may have meant that they used no scaffolding on the outside. Cornerstones were included in the design, to join the walls together and to support the higher floors. Interior scaffolds used in erecting the walls probably rested on those cornerstones, in which corbels were made for the purpose. Stones and beams were lifted with a windlass known as chIagIarg or zerazak. Large stones‚Äîsome weighing several tonnes‚Äîwere brought to the site by oxdriven sleds. The builders used many stonedressing tools‚Äîthe berg (pick), the varzap (a large hammer), the jau (a small hammer), the daam (chisel), etc. Mortar was made on the site. Sand or clay was admixed to it in localities where lime was expensive. One of the master builder's most critical tasks was to estimate the proper amount of mortar to ensure the seismic resistance of the tower. Joints between stones were filled in with limewash for rain not to damage mortar. Residential towers Ruins of Nikaroi settlement. A residential tower in foreground of the image. Central pillar (erd-bogIam) of residential tower in Haskali Residential towers were family dwellings, which have been compared to structures seen in prehistoric mountain settlements dating back to 8000 BC. The classic residential tower is a massive building, two to four stories high, with tapering walls and a flat shale roof. The floorplan is usually rectangular, measuring 8‚Äì10 by 8‚Äì12 meters. The tower tapered due to the walls getting thinner to the top, and due to their inward inclination. The thickness of the walls varies in different structures from 1.2‚Äì0.9 m at the bottom to 0.7‚Äì0.5 m at the top. The walls were made of stones of varying sizes (blocks or slabs, depending on the local stone), carefully dressed on the outside, with lime or clay-lime mortar and chip stone. Dry masonry was seldom used. Large stone blocks, sometimes weighing several tons, were used in the foundation and the ground-floor walls. The towers had a central pillar, also of thoroughly dressed stone blocks, which supported the ceiling rafters. Purlines rested on pilasters or cornerstones, and common rafters, in their turn, rested on the purlines. The upper floors consisted of wood sticks resting on the rafters, coated with punned clay. The ground floor was paved with boards or stone slabs. Besides its structural function, the central pillar (erd-bogIam) had symbolic and religious significance in Vainakh culture, since ancient times. The two lower stories of a residential tower were intended for livestock. Cattle and horses were usually sheltered in the ground floor, part of which was fenced off for grain storage. Some towers had pits on the ground floor for that purpose, with stone-lined walls and bottom. In towers with four stories, the first floor above ground was typically used to shelter sheep and goats. It had a separate entrance, reached by a log ramp. The family lived in the second floor above ground (or in the first, in three- story towers). The family possessions‚Äîcarpets, dishes, kitchen utensils, clothes, etc.‚Äîwere kept there, in tin-lined wooden chests or on wooden shelves along the walls. The older towers had no wardrobes; instead, clothes were hung on metal hooks. Other towers had niches on the walls for that purpose. There was usually an arrangement of weaponry on the wall above the master bed. It was a dire necessity in wartime, and mere tradition in peace. Military towers Military tower in Chanta. A majority of the military (\\"combat\\") towers in the Ingush and Chechen mountains functioned both as watchtowers and as signalling beacons. Some served as fortified guard posts, or as safe shelters for one or two families, which lived in nearby residential towers, against raids. In some places, such as at Mount Bekhaila, several towers were enclosed in a common wall to create a small fortress. Construction of military towers began in the 10th and 11th centuries, and peaked between the 14th and the 17th centuries. Chechen and Ingush military towers are fairly similar, differing only in size and the construction time. Depending on their age, they differ also in the sophistication of construction techniques and stone dressing, and in the grace of form. Combat towers were generally taller but narrower than residential ones: 20‚Äì25 meters high or more, with four of five floors and a square base 5‚Äì6 meters wide. They were built of dressed stone with lime or lime-sand mortar. They had blank walls, cut only by embrasures and observation slits, on the most vulnerable side. There were no wooden parts on the tower exterior lest besiegers put them on fire. Doors and windows were on the side hardest of access. In some cases it is hard to believe that the defenders themselves could enter the tower. The entrance door was on the second floor, accessed through a ladder. The defenders fired at the enemy through loopholes and the top of the tower had machicolations‚Äìoverhanging small balconies without a floor. Defensive towers were usually crowned with pyramid-shaped roofing built in steps and topping with a sharpened capstone. Beacon towers were erected on the top of cliffs to make them hard of access. The shape, size and site of a beacon was chosen so as to guarantee visual connection with the nearest beacons. Watchtowers were often built in strategic locations to control key bridges, roads and mountain passes. They were built near to a river, brook or spring, so that water could be brought into the tower through a concealed water duct. The ground floor ceiling of the later, 15th‚Äì17th century towers was a false vault, known as nartol tkhov, with two intercrossing rows of reinforcing ribs. Special attention was paid to the dressing and finishing of the keystones at the top of doors and windows, called kurtulg (\\"proud stone\\"). They bore the name of the owner, and were frequently decorated with petroglyphs. Researchers differ in the functions of the various floors. Some assume that the ground floor was used for livestock, while others say it was a prison for captives. Actually it seems that the ground floor was filled in with stone and earth to reinforce the tower bottom against ramming. The classical combat tower was not intended to withstand long sieges. Tower defenders had only a small stock of food and extremely limited arsenals, be it arrows, stone missiles or powder and shot in later times. Due to their small size, a watchtower or a beacon could house four to six on outsentry duty. All combat tower stories were equipped for observation and fighting. Chechen and Ingush combat towers divide in three basic groups according to the type of roof: * Flat roof towers * Flat roof towers crenellated on the corners * Step pyramidal roof towers Mixed function towers Mixed purpose tower in Armkhi valley. In the 13th‚Äì14th centuries, increased danger of aggression in certain parts of the Ingush and Chechen mountains let to the reinforcement of residential towers. The result were buildings that combined the functions of residential and defensive towers; they were smaller in size than the former, but a bit wider than the latter. Like the military towers, they had loopholes and machicolations (m√¢chicoulis). These mixed-function towers are rare in the Chechen highland, probably because tower complexes and castles had become widespread by the time this concept appeared. Whereas a tower had space for only a few cows and horses, a castle could give shelter to the entire livestock in wartime.–ú–∞—Ä–∫–æ–≤–∏–Ω –í.–ò. –ü–∞–º—è—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–∏ –∑–æ–¥—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –≤ –≥–æ—Ä–Ω–æ–π –ß–µ—á–Ω–µ.

Origins His family came from Canville-les-Deux-√âglises near Dieppe, an important place in medieval times but now a small farming village.:fr:Canville-les-Deux- √âglises Born before 1153, he was the son of Richard de Canville, lord of the manor of Middleton Stoney in Oxfordshire where he had a castle, and his first wife Alice. His father was a loyal supporter of King Stephen of England, and of his successor Henry II, until his death in 1176 when most of his lands passed to his son.All Saints church, Middleton Stoney Career Already from 1174 a close associate of the king, by 1185 he had married a widowed heiress, Nicola de la Haie, and as her husband held not only her lands in England and Normandy but also her hereditary offices of sheriff of Lincolnshire and constable of Lincoln Castle. After the death of Henry II in 1189, these two posts were confirmed to him and Nicola by the new king Richard I.J. H. Round, ed., Ancient Charters, royal and private, prior to A. D. 1200 (Pipe Roll Society vol. 26, London: 1905), pp. 92‚Äì3. While Richard was overseas on the Third Crusade, in 1191 he transferred his loyalty to Richard‚Äùs younger brother and potential heir, Prince John. The Lord Chancellor of England, William de Longchamp, promptly stripped him of the shrievalty and ordered him to surrender Lincoln Castle. When this was refused, Longchamp ordered troops to seize the castle, but they were thwarted by Nicola, who they then besieged. In retaliation, Canville and John attacked and took the two royal castles of Nottingham and Tickhill, upon which Longchamp agreed a settlement and restored Canville as sheriff. In revenge, Longchamp arranged Canville's excommunication. In compensation, John appointed Canville as keeper of the honour of Wallingford and benefited from Canville's support during the rebellion of 1193.Lincoln Castle On returning to England in 1194, Richard stripped Canville of his offices and lands. Though he was able to buy back the right to his estates, but not his posts, he then faced legal charges brought by Longchamp over sheltering criminals and participating in John's illegal seizure of the castles of Nottingham and Tickhill.Irene Gladwin, The Sheriff: The Man and His Office, (1974), pp. 89‚Äì90 When John became king on Richard's death in 1199, he restored Canville to his posts, making him sheriff of Lincolnshire (which he held until 1205) and castellan of Lincoln. The rest of his public life was spent in local administration in Lincolnshire. He died shortly before January 1215, when his lands passed to his son. His widow continued to hold the castle, undergoing another prolonged siege by rebels in 1217, until she retired in 1226 and died in 1230. Landholdings In addition to Middleton Stoney, from his father he inherited lands at King's Sutton and Duddington in Northamptonshire, Godington in Oxfordshire and Avington in Berkshire. In 1166 his father also had nine knight's fees in the honour of Mowbray, probably derived from the honour of Stuteville, which he presumably inherited as well. Family By 1185 he had married Nicola de la Haie, widow of William fitz Erneis and one of three daughters and coheiresses of Richard de la Haie, a major Lincolnshire landowner whose family had founded the Premonstratensian house of Barlings Priory, and his wife Matilda, daughter of William Vernon. Her paternal grandfather Robert de la Haie, of Halnaker in Sussex, had in 1115 been granted the posts of hereditary constable of Lincoln Castle and hereditary sheriff of Lincolnshire. His children included: :Richard, who in 1200 married Eustacia, widow of Thomas Verdon and daughter and heir of Gilbert Basset, but died soon after February 1217, leaving a daughter: ::Idonea, who married William II Longesp√©e. :Nicola, who married Oliver Deincourt.

Background  It is not known when He Jintao was born, but it is known that his family was originally from Ling Prefecture (ÈùàÂ∑û, in modern Yinchuan, Ningxia). His great-grandfather He Xiaowu () and grandfather He Jun () both served as officers at Ling Prefecture. His father He Mo () served as an officer at Xia Prefecture (Â§èÂ∑û, in modern Yulin, Shaanxi).Old Book of Tang, vol. 181.  Early career  Eventually, He Jintao settled at Weibo's capital Wei Prefecture (), and came to serve in the Weibo army, under then-military governor Tian Hongzheng, who was obedient to the imperial government.As Tian served as the military governor of Weibo from 812 to 820, He Jintao's service under him must have been during those years. In a campaign that Tian waged against Wang Chengzong, the military governor of Chengde Circuit (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), when Wang was resisting the imperial government, there was a night when Weibo forces conducted a night raid against Chengde's capital Heng Prefecture (). Wang responded by sending an officer in an iron mask, commanding 1,000 cavalry soldiers, to counterattack against the Weibo forces. He Jintao engaged the Chengde cavalry soldiers and defeated them, almost capturing the officer in iron mask, causing much apprehension among the Chengde soldiers. After a subsequent campaign that Tian conducted against Li Shidao the military governor of Pinglu Circuit (Âπ≥Áõß, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong), in which He Jintao made contributions, He Jintao was given the honorary imperial censor title of Shiyushi ().New Book of Tang, vol. 210.  Seizure of Weibo Circuit and service as military governor  By 829, He Jintao was serving under Shi Xiancheng, who was ruling Weibo in de facto independence from the imperial government. However, as at that time, imperial forces were close to defeating the rebel general Li Tongjie, who controlled the neighboring Henghai Circuit (Ê©´Êµ∑, headquartered in modern Cangzhou, Hebei), and Shi became apprehensive. Under the advice of his son Shi Xiaozhang (), Shi Xiancheng offered to surrender control of Weibo to the imperial government and requested another command elsewhere. The reigning Emperor Wenzong reacted by commissioning Shi Xiancheng as the military governor of Hezhong Circuit (Ê≤≥‰∏≠, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), and Li Ting () the military governor of Yicheng Circuit (Áæ©Êàê, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan) as the military governor of Weibo. He also carved out three of Weibo's six prefectures ‚Äî Xiang (Áõ∏Â∑û, in modern Anyang), Wei (Ë°õÂ∑û, in modern Xinxiang, Henan, note different character than the capital of Weibo), and Chan (Êæ∂Â∑û, in modern Anyang) ‚Äî to create a new circuit, for Shi Xiaozhang to serve as military governor of.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 244. Thereafter, Shi Xiancheng prepared to depart Wei Prefecture. It was said that he stripped the headquarters and circuit treasury of its treasures, ready to take them to Hezhong, and this angered the soldiers. The soldiers mutinied and killed Shi Xiancheng, and they supported He Jintao to be their leader. When Li Ting subsequently arrived at Wei Prefecture, He Jintao refused to let him enter, and subsequently made a surprise attack, defeating him. At that time, the imperial treasury was drained, and the imperial government, judging that it had no ability to defeat He Jintao, capitulated and made He Jintao the military governor of Weibo, and further returned Xiang, Wei, and Chan prefectures to Weibo. It was said that as the military governor of Weibo, He Jintao was favored by his people. He died in 840, and the reigning Emperor Wuzong (Emperor Wenzong's younger brother) allowed his son He Chongshun to inherit the circuit.

Previously, she was the president of the Unified Democratic Forces (UDF), a coalition of Rwandan exile opposition groups with a large base of active members in Rwanda, Europe, United States of America and in Canada. She was UDF party candidate for Rwanda's August 2010 presidential elections, but was ultimately arrested and sentenced to prison. A Sakharov Prize nominee, she served 8 years of a 15-year prison sentence in Kigali Central Prison on charges of terrorism and threatening national security.  Family and career  Married and a mother of three, she trained in commercial law and accounting and graduated in business economics and corporate management in the Netherlands. Umuhoza worked as an official of an international accounting firm based in the Netherlands, where she was in charge of its accounting departments in 25 branches in Europe, Asia and Africa. In April 2009, she resigned from her function to dedicate herself to a political career and to prepare her to return to her homeland and, as the head of her political party, to contribute to the rebuilding of her country. In January 2010, Umuhoza returned to her country, after 16 years in exile, as the main leader of the Rwandan political opposition.  Political career  Since 1997, Umuhoza has been involved in the struggle of the Rwandan political opposition in exile. Umuhoza has been quoted as saying \\"My objective is to introduce Rwanda to the rule of law and a constitutional state where international democratic standards are respected, where patriotism will at last be the cornerstone for all public institutions.\\" Her political activities are centred around the idea of a state of justice where individuals choose their associations based on their shared political aspirations rather than their ethnic or regional background. She has also been vocal in calling for more empowerment of women in Rwanda. In 1997, Umuhoza joined the Republican Rally for Democracy in Rwanda. A year later, she became the president of its Netherlands branch and in 2000, she was nominated president of RDR at the international level. From 2003 to 2006, she occupied the post of president of the Union of Rwandan Democratic Forces UFDR (French: Union des Forces D√©mocratiques Rwandaises), the main coalition of political opposition parties and personalities in exile, of which RDR (Republican Rally for Democracy in Rwanda) is an active member. 13 September 2012, Victoire Ingabire Umuhoza, together with two other Rwandan political figures (Bernard Ntaganda and Deogratias Mushyayidi ‚Äì all currently imprisoned in Kigali), was nominated by 42 MEPs for the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought 2012 of the European Parliament.Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought 2012 5 December 2019, Victoire Ingabire was awarded the International Human Rights Award 2019 by the Association for Human Rights of Spain (APDHE) but was not allowed by the Rwandan government to attend the award ceremony of 2019 in Spain Unification of the democratic opposition The fight for a unified political opposition in exile dominated her political career. The Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) continued to monopolise power in Kigali, criminalising, persecuting or co-opting any resistance. Inside the country, opposition to the RPF-led regime in Rwanda is almost non-existent. Only diaspora-based associations were able to mount an opposition attempt to Rwandan current President Paul Kagame's regime but divisions and political rivalries in diaspora did not make this possible. In favour of fundamental change and reconciliation, she gradually changed the pace of the struggle towards a unified opposition with peaceful means to stand up to the challenge of offering to Rwandans an alternative to Paul Kagame's regime. In November 2004, in Amsterdam, Netherlands she organised a conference known as the \\"Forum on Peace, Security, Democracy and Development in the Great Lakes Region\\" which was followed by the Amsterdam Initiative with the aim to create the new platform for co-operation.Crumbling in exile: The changing nature of the Rwandan opposition Marina Rafti, 2005 In October 2005, Victoire initiated contacts with other opposition organisations and organised an all- inclusive meeting for all Rwandan civil society associations and political parties. A consensus of a common front against Paul Kagame's regime was finally reached. Starting from April 2006, she participated in the creation of the United Democratic Forces (FDU) and was elected president of the political platform. FDU has a goal to install the rule of law in Rwanda, underpinned by the respect of democratic values enshrined in the universal declaration of human rights and other international instruments relating to democracy and good governance. Umuhoza actively participated in Highly Inclusive Inter- Rwandan Dialogue (HIIRD) project in Barcelona, Spain in 2004, 2006 and in April ‚Äì May 2009 under the auspice of Juan Carrero Saralegui, the Nobel Peace Prize candidate and of Adolfo P√©rez Esquivel, recipient of the 1980 Nobel Peace Prize and Federico Mayor Zaragoza, the vice-president of the Alliance of Civilization. She proposed following emblematic reforms calling for change in daily life of all Rwandans and the way they relate to politics: Creation of a Committee of Truth, Justice and Reconciliation to help Rwandans towards true reconciliation; Introduction of a non-political commission in charge of rewriting and interpretation of the actual history of Rwanda; The passing of a bill for the right to private ownership and for protection of the weakest members of the public, for the guarantee by the law of equal opportunity and access to credit and employment for all citizens. One month after she arrived in Rwanda in January 2010, together with other two political opposition party leaders already in the country, she formed a Permanent Consultative Council of Opposition Parties, putting together their efforts to widen the political space for the opposition parties and to strengthen the democratic process in Rwanda. Support of the civil society Umuhoza is a founding member of many associations and foundations in the union sector: Association Contact, Dialogue et Actions Caritatives (CODAC) which seeks to give moral, legal advice and material support to the survivors of the Great Lakes region in the Netherlands or in their region; Association URAHO of women refugees from Rwanda in the Netherlands, focusing on getting Rwandese women out of isolation and helping them integrate into Dutch society, to assist non-accompanied children and asylum seekers; Fondation PROJUSTITIA-Rwanda, committed to fighting in favour of fair justice for all victims of the Rwandan tragedy; HARAMBE, platform of African women's associations in the Netherlands committed to promoting development of African women on the continent. Umuhoza was also a member of the executive committee of ZWALU, a platform bringing together foreign women in the Netherlands to promote their emancipation.  Criticism On the day of her arrival in the country, to honour the victims of the genocide, she visited the Gisozi Genocide Memorial Centre. In her remarks on unity and reconciliation, she stated that current political policy was not sufficient to bring about reconciliation, and noted as an example that the memorial did not acknowledge Hutus who also died during the genocide. She stressed that those who committed genocide as well as those who committed other war crimes and crimes against humanity should be brought before the courts of justice. Her speech was later submitted to the court after her arrest as evidence of genocide revisionism. Arrest and trial Umuhoza was placed under house arrest in April 2010. She was arrested on 14 October 2010. She appeared in court and was charged alongside four alleged co-conspirators (Colonel Tharcisse Nditurende, Lieutenant Colonel Noel Habiyaremye, Lieutenant Jean Marie Vianney Karuta and Major Vital Uwumuremyi). Rwandan prosecution accused her of \\"Forming an armed group with the aim of destabilising the country, complicity to acts of terrorism, conspiracy against the government by use of war and terrorism, inciting the masses to revolt against the government, genocide ideology and provoking divisionism\\". She denies all the charges which she claims are politically motivated. During pre-trial formalities in September, Ingabire's defence lodged two motions. The first was against the territorial jurisdiction of the High Court for acts allegedly committed while Ingabire was resident in the Netherlands. The second was that Ingabire's prosecution under the 2008 \\"genocide ideology\\" law amounted to retrospective application as all evidence provided dated from before 2007. 27 March 2012, Umuhoza launched a legal challenge in the Rwandan high court to nullify articles 2 ‚Äì 9 of the laws related to \\"divisionism\\" and \\"genocide ideology,\\" arguing that articles 2 and 3 of the law contradict articles 20, 33 and 34 of the constitution guaranteeing freedom of expression and that they are too broad thus denying the rights to give opinion on the genocide and being exploited by her government to limit the freedom of thought.Rwanda: Safer to stay silent: The chilling effect of Rwanda's laws on 'genocide ideology' and 'sectarianism' In her trial, the court suspended all debate related to \\"18/2008 laws\\" governing genocide ideology but decided to continue the proceedings against her on the other charges. 11 April 2012, A witness for the defence, former FDLR colonel Michel Habimana testified that state intelligence services had manufactured witness Uwumuremyi's story. He also testified that the prosecution's lead witness was lying about his own contact with Ingabire and his own rank within the FDLR. Already serving life in prison, Habimana was subjected to a cell search and had important documents relating to the case seized. The defence claimed intimidation of a key witness. Subsequently, Victoire Ingabire refused to return to the Rwandan courtroom and asked her lawyers not to return either. Her defence lawyer Iain Edwards said the boycott came after the former rebel colonel was interrupted while accusing the Rwandan intelligence services of offering money to rebels to make false claims against Ingabire. 18 October 2012, the Supreme Court of Rwanda dismissed Umuhoza's constitutional review case of Law N¬∞ 18/2008 of 23/07/2008 Relating to the Punishment of the Crime of Genocide Ideology. On articles 2 and 3, the court ruled that the scope of the law is meaningful, though it can require more clarifications in some cases. The court rejected the requests to nullify articles 4 to 9 on the law repressing genocide ideology and article 4 of the law on war crimes and crimes against humanity, saying that the articles no longer exist in the current code of laws. The state prosecutor asked a panel of judges to give Umuhoza the maximum life sentence. The verdict which was expected to be announced on 29 June was postponed four times until 31 October 2012. On 30 October 2012, Umuhoza was sentenced to eight years imprisonment by the High Court of Kigali for \\"conspiracy against the country through terrorism and war\\" and \\"genocide denial\\". On 13 December 2013, Rwanda's Supreme Court has upheld the conviction of Umuhoza and increased her jail term from eight to 15 years. =Appeal to the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights= 3 October 2014, Victoire Ingabire brought her case to the African Court on Human and Peoples‚Äô Rights (AfCHPR). Ingabire claimed that the State violated articles 7 (right to fair trial) and 9 (right to receive information and free expression) of the African Charter, and articles 14 (right to a fair trial), 15 (prohibition on retroactivity of the law), and 19 (right to hold opinions without interference) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. id. at paras. 77-78. 24 November 2017, The AfCHPR found that the State violated Ingabire‚Äôs right to freedom of expression under Article 9(2) (right to freedom of expression) of the African Charter and Article 19 (right to freedom of expression) of the ICCPR. The AfCHPR also found a violation of Ingabire‚Äôs right to defense under Article 7(1) of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights. the Court determined that threats and intimidation of one of the witnesses by prison officials, the use of evidence against Ingabire that was produced through that intimidation and never shown to the defense, and difficultly defense counsel had in questioning one witness were all in violation of the right to defense. The AfCHPR ordered the Republic of Rwanda to take all necessary measures to restore her rights and to submit to the Court a report on the measures taken within six months. 3 January 2018, Victoire Ingabire filed her Application for reparation and applied to the Court to annul the sentence of imprisonment and its consequences and award her full compensation for the prejudices suffered by herself, her husband and her three children as a result of the violations of her rights as set out in the Judgment of 24 November 2017. The AfCHPR, in its App. No. 003/2014 judgment on reparations of 7 December 2018, ordered the Respondent State to reimburse the Applicant the amount of ten million, two hundred and thirty thousand Rwandan Francs (FRw 10,230,000) for the entire material prejudice suffered; (iii) orders the Respondent State to pay the Applicant the amount of fifty-five million Rwandese Francs (FRw 55,000,000) as compensation for the moral prejudice she, her husband and her three children suffered; (iv) orders the Respondent State to pay all the amounts indicated in subparagraph (ii) and (iii) of this operative part within six (6) months, effective from the date of notification of its Judgment. According to Rwanda's newspaper, The New Times, on 14 September 2018, President Paul Kagame exercised his prerogative of mercy and granted early release to Umuhoza, as well as to 2000 other convicted persons.  Continued critique of the RPF  On 9 March 2019, a close aide to Victoire Ingabire Umuhoza, Mr. Anselme Mutuyimana, was found dead of strangulation.. In September 2019, Syldio Dusabumuremyi, her former party‚Äôs national coordinator was stabbed to death. At the time, the RIB announced it had two men in custody. Eug√®ne Ndereyimana, also a member of FDU-Inkingi, was reported missing on July 15, after he failed to arrive for a meeting in Nyagatare, in Rwanda‚Äôs Eastern Province. Boniface Twagirimana, her former party‚Äôs deputy leader, who ‚Äúdisappeared‚Äù from his prison cell in Mpanga, southern Rwanda, in October 2018 was missing at the time of writing.  Publications  Victoire Ingabire wrote a book \\"Between 4 walls of the 1930 prison: Memoirs of a Rwandan Prisoner of Conscience\\" in which she recounts her life experience for 3 years, from the moment she announced her candidacy for presidential elections, to her incarceration into the famous \\"1930\\" maximum security Rwandan prison and she describes her encounter with the Rwandan judicial system from within. Victoire Ingabire is the author of numerous articles and publications where she expressed her views on important issues pertaining to current events in her country and that of the Great Lakes region.

The unit was a United States Army Air Forces group of fighters, bombers, transports, military gliders and small planes operating in the South- East Asian Theatre of World War II. They were part of the U.S. Tenth Air Force providing close air support for the British Fourteenth Army in the Burma Campaign. The Air Commando Groups was born out of a simple need. That need was to support via light airplanes the evacuation and resupply requirements of British Long Range Patrol (LRP) groups, or Chindits, as they were affectionately called.

Swiss political poster advocating for the accession of Vorarlberg to the Swiss Confederacy (\\"Pro Vorarlberg\\" 1919/20). Alemannic Separatism is a historical movement of separatism of the Alemannic- German-speaking areas of Germany, France and Austria (viz., South Baden, Swabia (viz. most of W√ºrttemberg and all of Bavarian Swabia), Alsace and Vorarlberg), aiming at a unification with the Swiss Confederacy (later Switzerland). The historic origins of the movement lay in the Napoleonic era (ca. 1805‚Äì1815) and it was briefly revived both after the end of World War I (1919) and after the end of World War II (1946‚Äì1952). The term \\"Alemannic\\" for the group of High German dialects was introduced by Johann Peter Hebel in 1803, who named them for the Alamanni tribes of the Migration period. The Alemannic-speaking areas of Germany were separated into Baden and W√ºrttemberg, parts of Swabia were integrated into Bavaria in 1805; the Alemannic dialects were not the only dialects in those states (e.g. in Baden and W√ºrttemberg the Northern parts speak a Rhine Franconian dialects, East Franconian German as well as South Franconian German and in Bavaria there are Bavarian dialects as well as Rhine Franconian dialects, East Franconian German as well as South Franconian German. Alemannic dialects thus began to be subjected to a process of marginalization from a non-Alemannic administration. Alemannic separatism arose in the context of the resistance of the rural population of Baden against Napoleonic rule within the Confederation of the Rhine (1806‚Äì1813). After World War I, on 11 May 1919, the population of Vorarlberg within the short-lived state of Deutsch√∂sterreich (German Austria) voted for secession to Switzerland with 81% of the popular vote. The request was denied both by the government in Vienna and by Switzerland. Similar tendencies in Baden and W√ºrttemberg were repressed before a vote was taken. After the end of World War II, there was a political movement in southern Alsace and South Baden, originating from resistance movements against the Nazi regime, which aimed for the creation of a separate Alemannic state together with the Swiss canton of Basel. Otto Feger (1946) suggested a decentral organization of a \\"Swabian- Alemannic democracy\\" inspired by the Swiss model of direct democracy, while Bernhard Dietrich, mayor of Singen, aimed at a larger \\"Alpine union\\" which was to include also Bavarian speaking territories (e.g. Bavaria and Austria) and the German-speaking parts of the Swiss Confederation. Feger's 1946 Schw√§bisch- Alemannische Demokratie with 240,000 copies was the most-printed book in French-administered Germany (1945‚Äì1949). The organisational backbone of Alemannic separatism was the Schw√§bisch-Alemannischer Heimatbund, but the French administration was unsympathetic and refused the permission required for the foundation of a political party with the aim of such an Alemannic state. The current Bundesland Baden-W√ºrttemberg within the Federal Republic of Germany was founded in 1952, effectively ending any serious political scenarios of Alemannic separatism, although the concept remains alive as a nostalgic sentiment rather than a political program. This is particularly true in South Baden, which was the only region where the majority of people voted against unification with W√ºrttemberg in the 1951 plebiscite that was held to authorize the unification in accordance with Article 29 of the new West German constitution, the Grundgesetz. The overall vote was however in favour of the creation of the new S√ºdweststaat (Southwest Land).

Biography  Diego Hern√°ndez de Serpa was born in Palos de la Frontera, Spain, around the year 1510. Since his youth, he had traveled to the Spanish Americas. He and his brother, Gin√©s Hern√°ndez de Serpa, went in 1524 to the small island of Cubagua, off the coast of present-day Venezuela. The island was thriving from the pearl industry. The two brothers prospered there. Hern√°ndez accompanied Diego de Ord√°s in the Spanish expedition up the Orinoco River in 1530, searching for fabled El Dorado. Until 1537, during his return to Cubagua, Hern√°ndez was responsible for defending against pirates and for seven years he traveled the Caribbean in pursuit of corsairs. In 1537, the crisis intensified in New Cadiz, and there was a discovery of oyster beds in the Cabo de La Vela, where the majority of colonists in Cubagua were sent. Around 1539, he went to Quito, where he lived some eight years with his family. His travels took him to Santa Marta, and then in 1564 to Cartagena, both in Colombia. He then went to Panama, and back to Spain for two years. In Spain, in 1550, Hern√°ndez married Constanza Alonzo. They had a son, Garc√≠, who was born around 1545 in Palos de la Frontera, and a daughter, Leonor, born in 1551. During his constant travels, he established a friendship with Juan Caballero, son and heir of don Diego Caballero, one of the wealthiest men in the Antilles and of the new colony of Paria. This relationship gave Diego notable political and economic influence. Hern√°ndez had spent forty-eight years in the Americas and demanded as a reward for his services to the Spanish crown that he be appointed governor of Paria and Cuman√°. He negotiated with the Royal Audiencia of Santo Domingo over a new enterprise, the conquering of Guayana in northern South America. Negotiations began in 1544, and it was eventually authorized in 1549. He was granted troops and named captain of the Conquest of Guayana. There was a quick suspension, due to lack of royal authorization and opposition from the colonial governor of Isla Margarita in the Caribbean Sea. Finally he was able to pass Isla Margarita and was named Mayor and Captain of the War of Maracapana (Tierra Firme). He then took up the expedition towards El Tocuyo on the Tocuyo River. After a long march of six months he arrived at his destination in the middle of 1552. He participated in the founding of Nueva Segovia de Barquisimeto, present day Barquisimeto, in 1552 on the Turbio River. Diego Hern√°ndez de Serpa died on May 10, 1570.

Until its merger with the Women's Educational and Industrial Union in 2006, Crittenton, Inc. offered programs in housing, education and child-care, health, nutrition, parenting, and family life skills. Women's Educational and Industrial Union The Women's Educational and Industrial Union (WEIU) was founded for the advancement of women in 1877 in Boston, Massachusetts by Harriet Clisby, one of America's first women physicians. In the 20th century, it created many programs that were geared toward the advancement of women in the workplace, and especially focused on low-income mothers and their families. In 2001, the WEIU launched the Woman to Woman Program, offering career development and mentoring to low-income mothers. Now offered by CWU, this program continues to serve low-income women today.

Distinguished in the field of U.S. Immigration Law, Wildes served as the National President of the American Immigration Lawyers Association in 1970. Wildes' clientele includes many high-profile clients, notably John Lennon and Yoko Ono, whom he successfully represented in deportation proceedings from 1972‚Äì1976. Early life and academic pursuits Born and raised in Pennsylvania where he was an honor graduate of Olyphant High School, Wildes received his bachelor's degree in New York Magna Cum Laude from Yeshiva College. His brother Jerry (Jerome) Wildes served in the United States Air Force and then went to medical school. Leon was awarded J.D. and Ll.M. degrees from the New York University School of Law. He currently serves on the Yeshiva College Board of Overseers and is Treasurer of the Yeshiva College Board. Wildes has published numerous articles in the immigration field from 1959 to date and has lectured broadly to lawyers for the Practising Law Institute, the New York State Bar Association, and the American Immigration Lawyers Association. He has testified before Congress on immigration legislation on numerous occasions since 1970, representing the Association of Immigration & Nationality Lawyers, the recognized national bar association of lawyers in the immigration and nationality field. He has contributed law review articles to the San Diego Law Review, Cardozo School of Law Law Review and the Brooklyn Law Review on subjects relating to U.S. Immigration Law. Law career During 1959 he served as Migrations Specialist with the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, where he concentrated his efforts on issues in U.S. immigration and refugee law. He currently serves on the Board of Directors of HIAS as an Honorary Director. In 1960 Wildes opened his law office, Wildes & Weinberg P.C., concentrating in the field of U.S. immigration and nationality law. Wildes was awarded the Edith Lowenstein Award for Outstanding Contributions in the Field of Immigration Practice and the Elmer Fried Prize for Excellence in Teaching Immigration Law. Wildes served as an Adjunct Professor of Law at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, where he originated the immigration law course and has guided Cardozo's active participation in the immigration law field since. Wildes also founded an Immigration Law Externship Clinic through which students work on immigration cases for a variety of non-profit organizations under the supervision of immigration attorneys. Wildes garnered much acclaim for his successful representation of former Beatle John Lennon and his artist wife, Yoko Ono, in their deportation proceedings instituted by the Nixon administration. Wildes contributed five full law review articles on the subject of developments in U.S. immigration law which resulted from his handling of the Lennon case. While working on the Lennon case, he discovered the government's unpublished practice of granting deportable aliens non-priority status to avoid their removal in sympathetic cases. He has guided the development of this remedy in the law, later referred to as Deferred Action or Prosecutorial discretion. This program allows law-abiding individuals to remain in the United States and avoid deportation if they are elderly, seriously ill, or undergoing severe hardship. Wildes co-produced Mark St. Germain's off-Broadway play \\"Ears on a Beatle\\" depicting the surveillance of John Lennon by the FBI at the time. Wildes also appeared alongside his clients in many press conferences and was interviewed with Lennon by Tom Snyder on The Tomorrow Show, and he appears in the documentary The U.S. vs. John Lennon, which focuses on this period of Lennon's life.

It says that if the game cannot end in a draw, then one of the two players must have a winning strategy (i.e. force a win). An alternate statement is that for a game meeting all of these conditions except the condition that a draw is not possible, then either the first-player can force a win, or the second-player can force a win, or both players can force a draw. The theorem is named after Ernst Zermelo.  Conclusions of Zermelo's theorem  Zermelo's work shows that in two-person zero-sum games with perfect information, if a player is in a winning position, then they can always force a win no matter what strategy the other player may employ. Furthermore, and as a consequence, if a player is in a winning position, it will never require more moves than there are positions in the game (with a position defined as position of pieces as well as the player next to move).  Publication history  Zermelo's original paper describing the theorem, √úber eine Anwendung der Mengenlehre auf die Theorie des Schachspiels, was published in German in 1913. Ulrich Schwalbe and Paul Walker translated Zermelo's paper into English in 1997 and published the translation in the appendix to Zermelo and the Early History of Game Theory.  Details  Zermelo considers the class of two-person games without chance, where players have strictly opposing interests and where only a finite number of positions are possible. Although in the game only finitely many positions are possible, Zermelo allows infinite sequences of moves since he does not consider stopping rules. Thus, he allows for the possibility of infinite games. Then he addresses two problems: # What does it mean for a player to be in a 'winning' position and is it possible to define this in an objective mathematical manner? # If the player is in a winning position, can the number of moves needed to force the win be determined? To answer the first question, Zermelo states that a necessary and sufficient condition is the nonemptyness of a certain set, containing all possible sequences of moves such that a player wins independently of how the other player plays. But should this set be empty, the best a player could achieve would be a draw. So he defines another set containing all possible sequences of moves such that a player can postpone her loss for an infinite number of moves, which implies a draw. This set may also be empty, i. e., the player can avoid her loss for only finitely many moves if her opponent plays correctly. But this is equivalent to the opponent being able to force a win. This is the basis for all modern versions of Zermelo's theorem. About the second question, Zermelo claimed that it will never take more moves than there are positions in the game. His proof is a proof by contradiction: Assume that a player can win in a number of moves larger than the number of positions. Of course, at least one winning position must have appeared twice. So the player could have played at the first occurrence in the same way as he does at the second and thus could have won in fewer moves than there are positions.  Example  When applied to chess, Zermelo's Theorem states \\"either White can force a win, or Black can force a win, or both sides can force at least a draw\\".

He mustered many armies against the Irish, and due to his harsh methods as Justiciar, he received criticism from King Henry III of England. He was succeeded as Lord of Offaly by his son, Maurice FitzGerald, 3rd Lord of Offaly. Career He was born in Ireland in 1194, the son of Gerald FitzMaurice, 1st Lord of Offaly and Eve de Bermingham (died between June 1223/December 1226). He succeeded to the title of Lord of Offaly on 15 January 1204, and was invested as a knight in July 1217, at the age of 23. In 1224 he founded South Abbey, Youghal, the proto-friary of the Irish Province of the Observant Franciscans, dedicated to St. Nicholas. Maurice was summoned to London to accompany King Henry III of England to Poitou and Gascony in October 1229. He was appointed Justiciar of Ireland in September 1232 and held the post until 1245. His reputation was marred by rumours that he had contrived the death of Richard Marshal, 3rd Earl of Pembroke in 1234. FitzGerald met Marshal at the Battle of the Curragh on 1 April, where Marshal was wounded and died shortly after. It was rumoured that Marshal had been betrayed. FitzGerald then proceeded to London, where he took an oath before Henry III, that he innocent of any participation in Marshal's death. He later founded the Dominican Abbey at Sligo, to house a community of monks to say prayers for Earl Marshal's soul.Webb, Alfred. A Compendium of Irish Biography, 1878 In February 1235, the King criticised him for his proceedings in office, and described him as \\"little pleasant, nay, beyond measure harsh in executing the King's mandates\\". The same year, he took part in the subjugation of Connacht. In the years 1241 and 1242, and later in 1246, 1247, and 1248 he mustered armies against the Irish. In 1247, Maurice invaded T√≠r Chonaill, and fought the combined forces of Cine√°l Chonaill and Cine√°l Eoghain at the Battle of Ballyshannon. According to various Irish annals, three eminent lords fell in battle against him: Maol Seachlainn √ì Domhnaill, King of T√≠r Chonaill, An Giolla Muinealach √ì Baoighill, and Mac Somhairle, King of Argyll (a man seemingly identical to Ruaidhr√≠ mac Raghnaill). In 1245, Maurice was dismissed from his post as Justiciar as a result of tardiness in sending the King assistance in the latter's military campaigns in Wales. His successor was John FitzGeoffrey. That same year he laid the foundations for Sligo Castle. In 1250, he held both the office of Member of the Council of Ireland, and Commissioner of the Treasury. He also founded the Franciscan Friary at Youghal; hence his nickname of an Brathair, which is Irish for The Friar. He was at the English royal court in January 1252, and received an urgent summons from King Henry in January 1254. Marriage and issue He married Juliana de Grenville (Genealogists had previously named her as Juliana de Cogan, but this was an error since this was the name of his granddaughter through his oldest son Gerald), and by her, they had four sons: * Gerald FitzMaurice FitzGerald (died 1243), married a woman whose name is not recorded by whom he had a son, Maurice Roe FitzGerald (drowned July 1268 returning from England when his ship was last in the Irish Sea),Connellan, Owen.

One of a series of treaties designed to isolate Spain, France agreed to subsidise the Dutch in their War of Independence in return for naval assistance, and trading privileges. It ultimately proved controversial, since its provisions were used to require the Protestant Dutch to help suppress their French co-religionists in La Rochelle. Background The first half of the 17th century in Europe was dominated by the struggle between the Bourbon kings of France and their Habsburg rivals in Spain and in the Holy Roman Empire. Habsburg territories in the Spanish Netherlands, Franche-Comt√©, and the Pyrenees blocked French expansion, and made it vulnerable to invasion. During the French Wars of Religion, Spain co-operated with the Catholic League in occupying large areas of France, before the succession of Henry IV in 1589 ended the conflict. After Henry's assassination in 1610, his wife Marie de' Medici became regent for the nine-year-old Louis XIII, and continued to exercise considerable influence after the regency ended in 1614. This led to a series of revolts by powerful regional nobles, both Catholic and Protestant, who resented attempts to reduce their authority, while religious tensions were heightened by the outbreak in 1618 of the Thirty Years War. In 1621, Royalist forces re-established Catholicism in the Protestant region of B√©arn, resulting in a Huguenot rebellion led by Henri de Rohan and his brother Soubise. The revolt ended in stalemate with the October 1622 Treaty of Montpellier. Habsburg possessions 1547 Having first entered government in 1616, Cardinal Richelieu's policy was to 'arrest the course of Spanish progress', and 'protect her neighbours from Spanish oppression'. Unlike many of his colleagues, he primarily opposed the Huguenots because their autonomy threatened the strong, centralised state needed to defeat Spain, rather than religion; he later proved equally ruthless in attacking their Catholic counterparts. With France weakened by internal divisions, Richelieu avoided direct conflict by supporting Spain's opponents, regardless of religion. This included funding the Protestant Dutch Republic in their 1568 to 1648 struggle for independence from Spain. In 1609, the two sides agreed a Twelve Years' Truce, and when the war restarted in 1621, Spain won a series of victories; by 1623, domestic opposition to the war and the heavy taxes levied to pay for it led the Dutch to seek external support. For different reasons, both England and France were concerned by Spanish advances in the Netherlands; in the Anglo-Dutch defensive alliance of 5 June 1624, James I agreed to provide 6,000 troops for two years. The Treaty of Compi√®gne was part of a two-pronged approach by Richelieu, who was also negotiating an alliance with England that resulted in the marriage of Henrietta Maria to Charles I of England. Provisions The principal negotiators were Richelieu for France and Nicolaas van den Bouckhorst, Sweder van Haersolte, and Arnold van Randwijck for the Dutch Republic. The signatories were Louis XIII of France and Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange. The term of the treaty was three years, during which France would pay subsidies as long as the Dutch continued fighting Spain. They received an immediate payment of 480,000 thalers, with the second instalment in November; by 1625, France was funding approximately 8% of the total Dutch defence budget. At this point, the French Navy was a negligible force, while the bulk of their merchant fleet was controlled by Huguenots. The Dutch gave France the right to purchase warships, agreed to contribute twenty for a joint attack on the Republic of Genoa, provide protection against pirates based in the Barbary States, and favourable terms for transporting French goods. However, they refused to allow French merchants to join voyages made by the Dutch East India Company or Dutch West India Company; the treaty ultimately agreed only to 'continue discussions'. Aftermath Capture of Isle de R√©, Sept. 1625 Encouraged by Richelieu, over the next few months England, Sweden, Denmark-Norway, Savoy and Republic of Venice agreed to co-ordinated action against Spain. In 1625, England declared war on Spain, Denmark invaded the Holy Roman Empire, while Venice and Savoy agreed to attack the Spanish Road, an overland route connecting Spanish areas in Italy with Flanders. However, this network of alliances was threatened in 1625 by another Huguenot revolt, centred on La Rochelle, then the second or third largest city in France, with over 30,000 inhabitants, and one of its most important ports. In addition to the customs duties generated by imports, it was also among the biggest producers of salt, a major source of taxes for the state; its economic value and position made its capture crucial. Richelieu now activated the mutual defence provisions of both treaties; England was asked for seven warships, while the twenty Dutch vessels allocated for the attack on Genoa were now to be used against La Rochelle. Despite popular opposition to attacking fellow Protestants, the Dutch States-General felt they had no option, since they could not afford to lose France as an ally. A combined French, English and Dutch force defeated a Huguenot squadron at Pertuis Breton in September 1625; the remnants led by Soubise were given refuge in Falmouth, calling into question England's commitment to the French alliance. In December, the States General gave secret orders to their commander, Admiral Willem Haultain de Zoete, to use any excuse possible to withdraw his ships. He did so in February 1626, at which point the French exercised their right to purchase six of them. The treaty of Compi√®gne thus allowed Richelieu to achieve his aim of neutralising Huguenot seapower and blockade La Rochelle; despite English attempts to relieve it, the city surrendered in October 1628, and the June 1629 Peace of Al√®s largely ended Protestant autonomy.

The Zizhi Tongjian indicated that Wang's death was reported to the imperial government in spring 855 and did not state whether Wang died then.

Like his father Wang Tingcou, Wang Yuankui ruled Chengde Circuit (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei) in de facto independence from the imperial government, but unlike Wang Tingcou, he was respectful to the imperial government and often followed its orders.  Background  Wang Yuankui was born in 812, during the reign of Emperor Xianzong, when his father Wang Tingcou was probably serving as an officer under Wang Chengzong, then the military governor of Chengde, whose family Wang Tingcou was related to by adoption ‚Äî as Wang Tingcou's great-grandfather Wang Wugezhi () was an adoptive son of Wang Chengzong's grandfather Wang Wujun.Old Book of Tang, vol. 142.

Sometime during Wang Tingcou's rule, he made Wang Yuankui one of the military commanders at Chengde's capital Zhen Prefecture (), as well as the commander of Chengde army. When Wang Tingcou died in 834, the soldiers supported Wang Yuankui to succeed him, and in 835, then-reigning Emperor Wenzong (Emperor Xianzong's grandson) commissioned Wang Yuankui military governor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 245. It was said that Wang Yuankui changed Wang Tingcou's defiant stance toward the imperial government, and was respectful to the imperial government, often offering tributes to the emperor.  As military governor  In 837, in response to Wang Yuankui's respectful attitude, Emperor Wenzong sent his cousin Princess Shou'an, a daughter to his uncle Li Wu the Prince of Jiang, to marry Wang. Wang sent his aunt Lady Duan to submit the bride price, and it was said that Lady Duan took to the capital Chang'an with her tributes of 2,000 plates of delicacies, armors, horses, cosmetics and furniture for the princess, and eunuchs and female servants. In 843, after Liu Congjian the military governor of nearby Zhaoyi Circuit (Êò≠Áæ©, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi) died, Liu Congjian's designated heir, his nephew Liu Zhen, sought imperial commission to inherit the circuit, but then-reigning Emperor Wuzong (Emperor Wenzong's younger brother) did not approve, and instead ordered a general campaign against Liu Zhen. As Emperor Wuzong and the lead chancellor Li Deyu were concerned that Wang, along with his neighbors He Hongjing the military governor of Weibo Circuit (È≠èÂçö, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei) and Zhang Zhongwu the military governor of Lulong Circuit (ÁõßÈæç, headquartered in modern Beijing) ‚Äî whose three circuits traditionally determined their own military governors and resisted the imperial government from ruling over them ‚Äî would militarily support Liu Zhen, Emperor Wuzong had Li Deyu draft an edict for him explicitly stating to Wang and He Hongjing that the situation with Zhaoyi was different and that he had no intent to get involved in the succession of military governors of Chengde or Weibo. It was said that therefore, Wang and He Hongjing did not support Liu Zhen.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 247. Subsequently, Emperor Wuzong put Wang and He Hongjing in charge of capturing the three Zhaoyi prefectures east of the Taihang Mountains. It was said that the day that Wang received the imperial edict, he immediately mobilized and took his forces to Zhao Prefecture (Ë∂ôÂ∑û, in modern Shijiazhuang) to ready for attack. Under battle orders that Emperor Wuzong subsequently issued to Wang, He Hongjing, Wang Maoyuan () the military governor of Heyang Circuit (Ê≤≥ÈôΩ, headquartered in modern Jiaozuo, Henan), Li Yanzuo () the military governor of Wuning Circuit (Ê≠¶ÂØß, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu), and Liu Mian () the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), Wang was specifically ordered to capture Xing Prefecture (ÈÇ¢Â∑û, in modern Xingtai, Hebei). Wang Yuankui quickly captured two Zhaoyi outposts and defeated relief forces Liu Zhen sent, and Emperor Wuzong used this opportunity to issue an edict praising him, in order to pressure Li Yanzuo, Liu Mian, and Wang Maoyuan to step up their attack. Emperor Wuzong also bestowed the honorary chancellor title of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi () on Wang Yuankui. When, by contrast, He Hongjing was not attacking Zhaoyi forces immediately, Wang Yuankui submitted multiple secret petitions accusing He Hongjing of being ambiguous in his attitude, and Emperor Wuzong pressured He Hongjing by ordering one of the main imperial generals, Wang Zai the military governor of Zhongwu Circuit (Âø†Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Xuchang, Henan), to go through Weibo territory in attacking Zhaoyi; this frightened He Hongjing, and he finally launched his troops in attacking Zhaoyi. In spring 844, the Hedong officer Yang Bian () mutinied, expelling then-military governor Li Shi, in cooperation with Liu Zhen. In response, Emperor Wuzong briefly refocused the military efforts to target Yang instead, and he ordered Wang Yuankui to lead his soldiers through Tumen (ÂúüÈñÄ, in modern Shijiazhuang) over the Taihang Mountains to support a counterattack by Hedong forces under the command of the officer Wang Feng (). However, as Hedong forces under the eunuch monitor L√º Yizhong () quickly recaptured Hedong's capital Taiyuan and killed Yang, it appeared that Wang Yuankui never actually launched his forces over the Taihang Mountains. In fall 844, Pei Wen () the brother of Liu Congjian's wife Lady Pei, whom Liu Zhen had put in charge of the three Zhaoyi prefectures east of the Taihang Mountains but who was angered that Liu Zhen's officer Liu Xi () was forcing his soldiers to pay taxes even as they were fighting, surrendered Xing Prefecture to Wang Yuankui. Subsequently, the other two prefectures ‚Äî Ming (Ê¥∫Â∑û, in modern Handan) and Ci (Á£ÅÂ∑û, in modern Handan as well) surrendered to He Hongjing. When the Zhaoyi officer Wei Yuantan (), who was defending Yaoshan (Â†ØÂ±±, in modern Xingtai), surrendered to Wang, Wang, who was angry that he was unable to capture Yaoshan up to this point, executed Wei. Further, he also killed some 20 Zhaoyi residents who were disrespectful to him during the campaign, and this caused the Zhaoyi soldiers to be apprehensive and close up their cities to ready for battle again. Emperor Wuzong, under Li Deyu's advice, issued an edict ordering Wang to stop his vengeance and ordering the new military governor of Zhaoyi, Lu Jun (), to comfort the region. (Soon thereafter, Liu Zhen's officer Guo Yi () killed Liu Zhen and surrendered the remainder of the circuit to imperial forces.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 248. After the end of the campaign, Emperor Wuzong rewarded Wang by bestowing on him the honorific title of Taifu () and creating him the Duke of Taiyuan. In 854, Wang died, and in spring 855 the death was reported to the imperial government.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 249. Then- reigning Emperor XuƒÅnzong allowed his son Wang Shaoding to inherit the circuit, and bestowed the posthumous honor of Taishi () on Wang Yuankui.

The area encompasses river channels, lakes, extensive marshes with wooded areas on higher ground, such as alder carrs, and well-preserved peat bogs that occupy around 1,000 km2. The area shows a clear succession of habitats from riverside fen through to raised bogs, grading into wet woodland. Because of this unique succession, the area supports a wide diversity of wildlife with large numbers of birds and mammals. Over 250 species of birds have been recorded including more than 80% of the Polish avifauna. Starting in the early spring mating birds attract birdwatchers from around the world. The marshes in the area are commonly flooded and the resulting alluvial soil supports an array of wetland vegetation. It is one of the largest wildlife refuges in Europe. The greater part of this area is the Biebrza National Park, covered by the Ramsar Convention to protect the wetlands and bird breeding grounds. Flora and vegetation In the area of the Biebrza Marshes 43 plant associations were distinguished, some rarely seen in other parts of Poland. Major communities are water, marsh, peat, reeds and forest communities including (alder, birch, riparian forests). Particularly valuable is a large group of sedge-moss communities, containing many rare and relict species, disappearing in other parts of the country. The vegetation is characterized by great diversity, a high degree of naturalness and the presence of many rare species, such as: *shrub birch and downy willow *Forkbeards: Lycopodium annotinum, clubmoss, fir *pink sand, Chimaphila umbellata, Polemonium caeruleum *sundew: Drosera rotundifolia, Drosera anglica *Pedicularis sceptrum-carolinum, marsh gentian, Swertia perennis *Siberian iris. *orchids (20 species), among others: Lady's slipper orchid, Dactylorhiza incarnata. Fauna Biebrza Marshes are the most important breeding area for many wetland bird species in Poland and amongst the most important in Central and Western Europe. This importance is increasing as wetlands are disappearing from the landscape of Europe. Biebrza Valley is of great importance for many species of birds feeding and resting during the annual migrations. There are also boreal breeding species, and species whose geographical center is located in the taiga and tundra zone. Among the mammals in the Biebrza Marshes are: *moose, which only survived here for World War II and was protected by multiply and spread on Polish territory *red deer, roe deer, wild boar, brown hare, European beaver *wolf, fox, raccoon, badger, polecat, pine marten, otter, stoat, weasel In the waters of Biebrza, there are approximately 36 species of fish such as pike, Wels catfish, eel, and also typical of the foothills of chub and barbel.

Nursing career Golding began her nursing career at the Royal Surrey County Hospital, Guildford, in 1922. Three years later she relocated to Aldershot for midwifery training. During Christmas 1939, she found herself in Northern France as Matron of No. 3 Casualty Clearing Station. Following the Second World War, Golding served in India as Principal Matron, the last sister of the Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service to serve there. In 1950 was served in Singapore as Matron for Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps (QARANC). As Director of Army Nursing Services, she represented the corps on many great occasions, but one of her proudest moments was attending a dinner offered by the army to Queen Elizabeth II after her accession to the throne in 1952. It had been more than a century since a banquet of such military magnitude had been held. Present were most members of the Royal Family, and more than 100 generals. She supervised the design of a new QA mess dress and it was worn for the first time on this evening. During her term of office she witnessed the marriage of the Colonel-in-Chief, Princess Margaret and the opening of the new QARANC Training Centre in Aldershot. Golding was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1958, and retired in 1960.

The contestant from Contestants' Row who bids closest to the price of a prize without going over wins the prize and has the chance to win additional prizes or cash in an onstage game. After the pricing game ends, a new contestant is selected for Contestants' Row and the process is repeated. Six pricing games are played on each hour-long episode. Prior to expanding to one hour in length, three games per episode were played during the half-hour format. With the exception of a single game from early in the show's history, only one contestant at a time is involved in a pricing game. A total of 110 pricing games have been played on the show, 77 of which are in the current rotation. On a typical hour-long episode, two games‚Äîone in each half of the show‚Äîwill be played for a car, at most one game will be played for a cash prize and the other games will offer merchandise or trips. Usually, one of the six games will involve grocery products, while another will involve smaller prizes that can be used to win a larger prize package. Some rules of pricing games have been modified over the years due to the effects of inflation. On the 1994 syndicated version hosted by Doug Davidson, the rules of several games were modified. Notably, the grocery products used in some games on the daytime version were replaced by small merchandise prizes, generally valued less than $100. Other special series‚Äîincluding The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular that aired in 2008, and special weeks such as Big Money Week and Dream Car Week‚Äîalso featured temporary rule changes to some pricing games. The names of some games are occasionally changed for episodes with specific themes, such as Earth Day, Halloween, and College Day. Active games A =Any Number= A gameboard contains spaces representing five digits in the price of a car, three digits in the price of a smaller prize, and three digits representing an amount of money (less than $10, in dollars and cents) in a piggy bank. The first digit in the price of the car is revealed at the beginning of the game (a rule implemented after cars valued at more than $10,000 were used in the game). The digits 0 through 9 each appear once in the remaining ten spaces, including a duplicate of the first digit in the price of the car. The contestant calls out digits one at a time, revealing them in the prices of the prizes on the gameboard, and wins the first prize whose price is completely revealed. B =Balance Game= A prop bag of money representing the last three digits in the price of a prize is placed on one side of a balance scale. The contestant is then shown three more bags, each representing a different value in multiples of $1,000, and must choose two of them to place on that same side so that the total of all three bags equals their guess at the correct price. A bag representing the full price is then placed on the other side of the scale; if the two sides balance, the contestant wins the prize. =Bargain Game = Two prizes are shown, each displaying a bargain price lower than its actual retail price. The contestant wins both prizes by choosing the one that has been marked down farther from retail. The game was known as Barker's Bargain Bar, named for previous host Bob Barker, until it was removed from rotation on December 5, 2008. The game returned on April 10, 2012 after a hiatus and was renamed Bargain Game, with a new set. =Bonkers= A gameboard displays an incorrect four-digit price for a prize and contains eight spaces: one space above and one space below each digit. The contestant is given four markers to place on the board and has 30 seconds to determine whether each correct digit in the price of the prize is higher or lower than the digit displayed, placing a marker above or below the incorrect digit to denote their choice. The contestant then presses a button. If the guessed pattern is correct, the contestant wins the prize. If the guess is incorrect, a buzzer sounds and the contestant must try again, not knowing how many digits are wrong or which ones. Changes can be made until the contestant finds the right pattern or until time has expired. =Bonus Game= The contestant is asked whether each of four small prizes is priced higher or lower than the incorrect price given. Each prize corresponds to one of four windows on a gameboard, one of which conceals the word \\"Bonus\\", and each correct guess wins the small prize and control of the window. The contestant wins a large bonus prize by correctly pricing the small prize with the window containing the word \\"Bonus\\". =Bullseye= Five grocery items are shown, and the contestant is asked to purchase a quantity of a single item such that the total price is between $10 and $12. The contestant may make three attempts, each with a different item, and immediately wins the game by succeeding on any one attempt. If the total for an item is between $2 and $10, the host places a marker on a target-shaped gameboard to indicate it. If the total is less than $2 or over $12, no marker is placed. One item has a bullseye hidden behind its price tag. If the contestant fails to reach the $10‚Äì$12 range on all three attempts, he/she can still win if the hidden bullseye is behind the price tag of an item for which he/she earned a marker on the target. Originally, the target featured a $5 to $10 range, with $9 to $10 as the bullseye range. Shortly thereafter, the target became $1 to $6, with a $5 to $6 bullseye range. C =Card Game= The contestant uses playing cards from a standard deck to bid on a car. Before playing the game, the contestant draws a card from another deck to determine how close their bid must be to the actual price, without going over, in order to win. The contestant's bid starts at $15,000 and increases as the contestant draws cards: face cards add $1,000 and numbered cards add their face value multiplied by $100. Aces are wild and can either be played immediately or held aside. When the contestant chooses to stop drawing cards, the price of the car is revealed. If the bid is within the target range without going over, the contestant wins the car. When the game debuted, no starting bid was given and aces could be made any value up to $1,000. The starting bid increased several times as a result of inflation to speed up the game: to $2,000 in 1983; $8,000 in 1993; $10,000 in 2001; $12,000 in 2005; and $15,000 in 2008. A rule change added in 2014 allows the game to be played for a luxury car, with the starting bid set at $60,000. Additionally, beginning in 1983 (coinciding with the addition of a starting bid), aces can be made any positive value the contestant chooses. The special deck has also changed several times. When the game debuted, the deck consisted of nine cards with one each of values from $200 to $1,000 in $100 increments. In 1983, when the game became The New Card Game, the deck consisted of twelve cards with two each of values from $500 to $1,000 in $100 increments. In 1993, the deck changed again to a deck of twelve cards with three each of values from $500 to $2,000 in $500 increments. In 2005, the deck changed to seven cards, with two each of $1,000, $2,000, and $3,000 values, and one $5,000 card. =Check Game= The contestant is shown a prize and asked to write an amount on an oversized blank check made out in his or her name. The value of the prize is then added to the amount written on the check and if the total falls between $8,000 and $9,000, the contestant wins both the prize and the cash amount of the check. Regardless of the outcome, the contestant receives the check as a souvenir. If he or she loses, the check is first voided with a rubber stamp. The game was originally titled Blank Check and had a winning range of $3,000 to $3,500. It was renamed \\"Check Game\\" in 1986 and the range fell between $5,000 and $6,000 by 1989 and between $7,000 and $8,000 by 2008. The current range went into effect in 2019. =Check-Out= The contestant is asked to individually price five grocery items. After all five guesses are tallied, the actual prices of the items are revealed. If the contestant's cumulative total is within $2.00 of the actual total price of the five grocery items high or low, the contestant wins a bonus prize. When the game began, the range was 50 cents, then raised to $1 in April 1996, before being raised to the current $2 range in October 2003. =Cliff Hangers= The contestant faces a gameboard consisting of a mountain slope divided into 25 steps, with a figure of a climber at its base and a cliff at the top. He/she must guess the retail prices of three small prizes, one at a time. The climber moves one step up the slope for every dollar the contestant is off, high or low, and the correct price is not revealed until after the climber has either stopped or fallen off the cliff. If the total of the contestant's errors on all three guesses is no more than $25, he/she wins the three small prizes and a larger prize. If the climber falls off the cliff, the game ends and the contestant wins only the small prizes he/she had priced before the fall occurred. Officially, the mountain climber has no name, although several hosts have used their own names for him. Doug Davidson referred to the climber on The New Price Is Right as Hans Gudegast, which is the birth name of his Young and the Restless co-star Eric Braeden. Drew Carey has referred to him as Hans, Yodel Man and most frequently, Yodely Guy. Carey has also referred to this game as \\"the Yodely Guy game\\". At The Price Is Right Live!, he is often referred to as Johann. Dennis James referred to the climber as Fritz. On an episode which taped in 1976, after the climber fell off the cliff, James commented, \\"There goes Fritz!\\", unaware that Janice Pennington's then-husband, Fritz Stammberger, had recently disappeared in what had been reported to be a mountain climbing accident at the time. James' offhand comment upset Pennington so much that she remained backstage crying for the rest of the episode. =Clock Game= The game is played for three prizes. The actual price of the first prize is shown to the studio and home audiences. After the contestant gives their first bid, a 30-second clock is started and the host tells the contestant whether the actual price is higher or lower than the bid. The contestant continues to bid, responding to the host's clues, until either the contestant wins by correctly guessing the price of the prize or the time expires. If time remains after the first prize is won, the process is repeated for the second prize. If the contestant prices both prizes within 30 seconds, he or she also wins the third prize as a bonus. Unlike other pricing games, the audience is required to remain silent while the contestant is making his or her bids. With few exceptions, the prizes which contestants must price have almost exclusively been valued below $1,000. Prior to the addition of a bonus prize, prizes priced above $1,000 were offered during the game for a brief period from 2008 to 2009. Prizes valued over $1,000 were also offered for a brief period in the 1980s. The contestant was given only the thousands digit in the price and was required to guess the remaining digits in the price. From 1998 to 2014, contestants were awarded a bonus of $1,000 for winning both prizes within 30 seconds. =Coming or Going= The contestant is shown a prize and the numbers in a four-digit price, which are displayed on a shelf. The shelf can be tilted in two directions (\\"coming\\" or \\"going\\"), producing two possible prices, one being the reverse of the other. In order to win the prize the contestant must tilt the shelf in the right direction. =Cover Up= Five spaces are shown on a gameboard. Above each space are numbers: two above the first space, three above the second space and so on up to six above the fifth space. The contestant is asked to choose a number in each column to create a price for a car. Any correct digits are then lit; the contestant immediately wins the car for having all five correct, or loses for having all of them incorrect. If some of the digits are correct, the contestant covers each incorrect digit with a new choice from its column. The game continues until the contestant either wins by getting all five digits correct, or loses by providing a price in which no new digits are correct. Although it does not affect gameplay, until May 23, 2013, a false price was initially placed at the start of the game, and the contestant was required to cover up the incorrect digits during his or her first turn. Since June 4, 2013, the false price has been replaced by various items such as certain symbols, the numbers on the false price being turned upside down, humorously altered photos of staff or special themes relating with the episode. D =Danger Price= The contestant is shown four prizes and a \\"danger price\\", which is the price of one of the prizes. In order to win the game and all four prizes, the contestant must select the three prizes that do not have the same value as the danger price. =Dice Game= The game is played for a car with a price that only contains the digits one through six. The first digit of the price is revealed, and the contestant rolls four dice on a gaming table, one at a time. The table has a line painted across its width near the end opposite the contestant, and a die must land entirely across the line in order to count. Each die corresponds to one of the remaining digits in the price. If the contestant rolls the actual digit, it is revealed on a gameboard. Otherwise, he or she must guess whether the correct digit is higher or lower than the one rolled. Any incorrect roll of one or six is defaulted to \\"higher\\" or \\"lower\\". The contestant wins the car by guessing correctly on all digits that he or she has not rolled exactly, or by rolling all four digits. Prior to 1977, the car price occasionally included zeroes or digits higher than six. Until 2007, the contestant was required to state \\"higher\\" for rolls of one and \\"lower\\" for rolls of six. Originally, when cars with four-digit prices were offered, the first number was not revealed to start the game. When cars priced above $10,000 were first offered in the 1980s, an extra digit readout was added to the left side of the gameboard for the first number in the price. The game was briefly renamed Deluxe Dice Game when this change first occurred. =Do the Math= A contestant is shown two prizes and the difference in their prices, typically an amount between $800 and $1,200. The contestant must decide whether that amount must be added to or subtracted from the price of the prize on the left to yield the price of the one on the right. A correct answer wins both prizes, plus a cash amount equal to their price difference. =Double Cross= An X-shaped touch screen board contains two rows of seven digits each, intersecting at the fourth digit. Each row corresponds to one of two prizes and contains a bar that highlights four consecutive digits. Whenever either bar is moved, the other one moves in the same way. The contestant wins both prizes by positioning the bars to highlight the correct prices, reading from upper left to lower right for one and lower left to upper right for the other. =Double Prices= The contestant is shown two possible prices for a prize, one of which is correct. The contestant wins the prize if he or she chooses the correct price. Two prizes were offered in early episodes of the 1970s syndicated edition hosted by Dennis James. Regardless of whether or not the contestant won the first prize, the contestant could win a second prize by choosing the correct price from a different set of two possibilities. E =Easy as 1 2 3 = The contestant is given three blocks marked \\"1\\", \\"2\\" and \\"3\\", which are used to rank three prizes from least expensive to most expensive. The contestant wins everything by correctly ranking all three items. F =Five Price Tags= The contestant is briefly shown five price tags, one of which is the correct price of a car. Four small prizes are then presented; for each one, the contestant must guess whether its displayed price is \\"true\\" (correct) or \\"false\\" (incorrect). Each correct guess wins that prize and one choice from the five price tags. After playing through all four prizes, the tags are brought out again and the contestant wins the car by selecting the correct price before running out of choices. If the contestant guesses all four small prizes incorrectly, the game ends. =Flip Flop= A gameboard displays four digits in the price of a prize arranged in pairs (e.g., 1234) on two panels. At least one of the pairs of digits needs to be reversed. The contestant may \\"flip\\" the first pair ($2,134), \\"flop\\" the second pair ($1,243), or \\"flip flop\\" both pairs ($2,143). The contestant wins the prize by making the correct choice. =Freeze Frame= A ring of eight tiles, each with a two-digit number, rotates clockwise through a frame at the top of a gameboard. Two of the tiles appear in the frame at a time, forming a four-digit price. The contestant pulls a lever to stop the ring from moving when he or she believes the price within the frame is the price of the prize. If the contestant guesses the price correctly, he or she wins the prize. G =Gas Money= The contestant is shown five prices for a car. One at a time, the contestant selects the four prices he or she believes to be incorrect. Each successful choice wins one of four different cash amounts hidden behind the prices ($1,000, $2,000, $3,000, or $4,000). After each guess, the contestant may choose to either stop and keep any cash won, or risk what has already been won by selecting another price. If the contestant successfully guesses all four incorrect prices, he or she wins the car and $10,000. If the contestant guesses the correct price at any time, the game ends and the contestant loses everything. Prior to June 19, 2009, contestants had to select what they believed to be the actual price of the car before attempting to eliminate the other four incorrect prices. =Golden Road= Three prizes are presented, the first and second of which have three- and four-digit prices. The final prize is often billed as one of \\"the most expensive single prizes offered on the show\\", with a price consisting of five (or occasionally six) digits. Since 2008, the final prize is usually a premium European sports or luxury car, although premium American sports cars are also offered, especially for patriotically-themed episodes. The hundreds digit is missing from the price of each prize, and the digits in the prices of the first two prizes do not repeat. The contestant is shown the price of a grocery item worth less than $1 and is then asked which of the two unique digits in its price belongs in the price of the first prize. If correct, the three digits in that price are used to select the missing digit for the second prize. If the contestant prices the second prize correctly, the four numbers in its price are used to select the missing digit for the final prize. If the contestant makes an incorrect choice at any time, the game ends but he or she wins any correctly priced prizes. =Grand Game= The contestant is shown a target price and six grocery items, four of which are priced below the target price. One at a time, the contestant selects items he believes are priced lower than the target. The contestant's winnings start at $1 and are multiplied by ten for each correct selection, to $10, $100 and $1,000. A contestant who makes an incorrect guess prior to reaching the $1,000 level keeps whatever money is accumulated to that point. After reaching the $1,000 level, the contestant may choose to quit the game and keep his or her winnings or to risk that money in order to attempt to select the one remaining product priced lower than the target. A correct final choice wins the maximum of $10,000. However, if the final item the contestant selects is one of the two above the target price, the contestant loses everything. =Gridlock! = The contestant is shown a row of seven model cars, the leftmost of which displays the first digit in the actual price of a car. The remaining six (three blue, followed by three red) each display a pair of digits. The contestant selects the blue car that he/she believes shows the second and third digits in the actual price. If the choice is correct, the contestant then tries to select the correct last two digits from among the red cars. The contestant wins the car by completing its price. Selecting one incorrect pair of digits allows the contestant to choose again from the remaining two cars in that group, but a second mistake ends the game. =Grocery Game= The contestant is shown five grocery items and asked to purchase quantities of them to total between $20 and $22. The contestant can purchase any quantity of any item, but may not use any item more than once. After the contestant selects an item, its price is revealed and multiplied by the quantity, then added to the contestant's running total on a cash register. If the contestant succeeds, he or she wins a prize. The game is lost if the contestant's total exceeds $22 or he or she exhausts all five items before reaching $20. Prior to 1989, the original total range was $6.75 to $7. From 1989 through 2016, the winning range was $20 to $21. The first four times the game was played, the contestant received $100 at the start of the game, which he or she kept if he or she won, chose to stop before exceeding $7, or lost without exceeding $7. The contestant also received supplies of the five items in each of those four games. The quantities varied but always totaled at least $100 and counted toward the contestant's winnings. H = Off = A $10,000 cash prize is hidden in one of 16 boxes. The contestant is presented with three pairs of small prizes. Within each pair, one prize is correctly priced and the other has had its price cut in half. Each time the contestant selects a half-price prize, he or she wins that pair of prizes and half of the remaining boxes are eliminated, leaving the winning box still in play. After all three pairs have been played, the contestant has one chance to select that box and win the $10,000. Guessing correctly on all three pairs awards a $1,000 bonus, which the contestant keeps regardless of the outcome. On the episode which aired October 19, 2007, the rules were modified to award the contestant $500 in addition to the two smaller prizes for each pair correctly priced, for a total of $1,500. Beginning September 28, 2010, the $500 per-pair bonus was removed. Instead, contestants now win a $1,000 bonus for correctly pricing all three pairs of items. Under both formats, the contestant keeps the bonus money even if he or she does not win the grand prize. =Hi Lo= The contestant is shown six grocery items and must choose the three with the highest prices in order to win. These items' prices are placed in the \\"Hi\\" row of the gameboard, and the lowest price in that row is kept and the others discarded before the other three items' prices are revealed and placed in the \\"Lo\\" row. The contestant wins if all three of the prices are lower than the remaining \\"Hi\\" price. Early in the game's history, the contestant was asked whether each individual item's price belonged in the \\"Hi\\" row or the \\"Lo\\" row. The contestant either won the game by correctly placing each of the six prices or lost by making a mistake. =Hole in One (or Two) = The contestant must putt a golf ball into a hole (similar to miniature golf) in order to win a car. The putting green has six white lines painted across its width, and the contestant begins at the one farthest from the hole. He or she is asked to put six grocery items in ascending order of price. For every successive price that is higher than the one before it, the contestant moves one line closer to the hole. Correctly ordering all six items awards a $500 bonus, which the contestant keeps regardless of the outcome. If the contestant misses the putt, the host reveals the full name of the game as \\"Hole in One or Two\\" and he or she is given a second chance to make the putt from the same line. Prior to the contestant's first attempt, the host usually takes an \\"inspiration putt\\" from the farthest line to demonstrate the use of the putter, although a model or golf-involved guest will occasionally perform this instead. Until October 10, 1986, the contestant was allowed only one putt to win the car. The game's name became Hole in One or Two when the second-putt rule was instituted. =Hot Seat= Five small prizes are displayed onstage, arranged on a row of pedestals, and the contestant sits in a chair that moves automatically from one to the next. As the contestant reaches each prize, an incorrect price is revealed and he/she must press one of two buttons to guess whether the true price is higher or lower. The contestant has 35 seconds to make all five guesses. If time runs out, any prizes the contestant has not reached are taken out of play. The contestant is told that all of his/her correct guesses will be revealed first, and the chair moves to one of the five prizes. If the contestant's guess on this prize is correct, he/she wins the prize and $500. Successive correct guesses increase the winnings to $2,500, $5,000, $10,000, and finally $20,000. After the chair has moved to the next item, the contestant may choose to stop before the price is revealed and keep all money won to that point, but if an incorrect guess is revealed, the game ends, and the contestant loses everything; however, they keep any small prizes won to that point. I =It's in the Bag= The contestant is shown a series of five grocery bags, with a price tag on each one indicating the retail price of a grocery item in the bag. Six grocery items are then shown: five of the six items correspond to the items in the bags, while the sixth item does not match any of the displayed prices. One at a time, the contestant must match up the grocery items with their prices. After all five choices have been made, the host reveals the price of each item. If the item in the bag matches the one the contestant chose, the contestant wins the corresponding amount of money and must decide whether or not to continue to the next level or quit with the money he or she has already won. If the contestant chooses to continue and an incorrect match is revealed, the game ends and he or she loses everything. The first correct match wins $1,000, and each successive correct match doubles the contestant's winnings ($2,000, $4,000, $8,000 and $16,000). L =Let 'em Roll= This game, loosely based on the dice game yacht, is played for a car or a cash prize of up to $7,500. It uses five large dice, each marked with an image of a car on three sides and cash values of $500, $1,000 and $1,500 on the other three. The contestant is given one roll of the dice and can earn up to two more using three grocery products. The price of the first item is given, and the contestant must determine whether the price of each of the next two items is higher or lower than the one preceding it. In order to win the car, the contestant must roll a car on all five dice within their allotted number of rolls. All dice that display cars are taken out of play after each roll. At any point, the contestant can elect to take the sum of the cash values on the remaining dice and quit; contestants who use all of their rolls without winning the car automatically receive the total of the displayed values on their final roll. =Line 'em Up= Line 'em Up is played for a car and three other prizes. The contestant is shown the first and last digits of the car's price. Two of the smaller prizes each have a three- digit price and one has a two-digit price. In order to win the car and the prizes, the contestant must line up the three prices in a frame to display a price for the car. If the guess is correct, the contestant wins everything. Otherwise, the contestant is told how many of the digits are correctly placed‚Äîbut not specifically which ones‚Äîand the contestant then makes a second guess. The contestant wins nothing if he or she guesses incorrectly on the second attempt. =Lucky Seven = The contestant is given seven $1 bills and shown the first digit in the price of a car. The contestant guesses the remaining digits in the price, one at a time, losing $1 for each digit of difference between their guess and the correct digit. If the contestant has at least $1 remaining after all digits are played, he or she wins the car (using $1 to buy it), plus any additional money not used in the game. Originally, all cars appearing in this game were priced under $10,000 and no free digits were revealed. When cars priced above $10,000 began to regularly appear, the free digit rule varied: on six special episodes which aired in prime time during the summer of 1986, the last digit in the price was revealed at the start of the game and the contestant had to guess the first four digits. Later that year on the daytime show, the contestant was offered the first digit and was required to guess the last four digits in the price. On November 5, 2009, to celebrate the show's 7,000th episode, the game used seven stacks of $1,000 instead of the usual seven $1 bills. During that episode, the contestant needed at least $1,000 to buy the car, and kept any remaining money if he or she won the car. M =Magic #= The contestant is shown two prizes and told which one has the higher price. He or she then pulls a lever to adjust a \\"magic number\\" on a display so that it falls between the two prices. The contestant wins both prizes by setting the number correctly. =Make Your Move= The contestant is shown a sequence of nine digits on a gameboard which include, consecutively but in unknown order, the prices of three prizes: one of each with a two-, three- and four-digit price. Three sliding markers are set underneath the digits, one for each prize. In order to win everything, the contestant must correctly position the markers under the corresponding prices, using each digit once without overlapping. For a brief time in October 1990, a second prize with a three-digit price replaced the prize with a two- digit price. Under these rules, one of the numbers on the board appeared in the price of two prizes, requiring the sliders to overlap. =Master Key= A car and two additional prizes are each represented by a giant padlock. The contestant is shown two small prizes, each displaying a string of three digits, and must decide whether the first two or last two digits make up the correct price. For example, a prize showing \\"357\\" has a price of either $35 or $57. Each time the contestant chooses a correct price, he or she wins that prize and selects one key from a rack of five. Three of the keys correspond to one prize lock each, one will open none of the locks, and one (the \\"Master Key\\") opens all three. If the contestant earns any keys, he or she tries them in the locks and wins any prizes he or she is able to unlock. If a key opens the first lock (or the second one if the first has already been opened), the contestant is then directed to try it in the third lock to see if it is the Master Key. =Money Game= The contestant is shown a board of nine two- digit numbers, two of which are the first and last two digits in the price of a car. The middle digit is revealed at the outset, and the contestant chooses one number at a time. The correct numbers hide the front and rear halves of the car, while all others hide dollar signs. Any incorrect numbers chosen by the contestant are placed into a column of four blank spaces and awarded as cash. If the contestant completes the price before filling the column, he/she wins both the car and the sum of the incorrect guesses; if the column is filled first, he/she wins only the cash total. When the game was first played for cars with a five-digit price, the game was titled Big Money Game. For cars with four-digit prices, no digit in the price was revealed at the start of the game. Also, on the Tom Kennedy-hosted syndicated version in 1985, the contestant was shown the last digit in a five-digit price, meaning the contestant had to find the third and fourth digits in addition to the first two. =More or Less= The game is played for a car and three additional prizes. The contestant is shown an incorrect price for the first prize and is asked to guess whether its actual price is more or less than the one displayed. If the contestant is correct, he or she wins that prize and moves on to the next one, with the car as the last prize. A mistake at any point ends the game, but the contestant keeps any prizes correctly priced up to that point. =Most Expensive= The contestant is shown three prizes and must choose which is the most expensive in order to win everything. N =Now....or Then = The contestant is shown six grocery items, each marked with a price, arranged on a circular gameboard. The gameboard also shows a month and year, usually from the past eight to twelve years. The contestant selects an item and must determine whether the price given for the item is the current price (now) or the price as of the specified past date (then). To win the game and a large prize, the contestant must make correct guesses for three adjacent wedges of the circle. The game ends if incorrect guesses make it impossible to claim three adjacent wedges. Prior to December 2, 1986, the original name of the game was Now....and Then. The name was changed to reflect the decision made by the contestants. O =One Away= The contestant is shown an incorrect price for a car. Each of the individual digits displayed is either one digit higher or one digit lower than the correct digit in the price. The contestant adjusts each digit and wins the car if they have correctly chosen all five. If all five digits are wrong, the contestant automatically loses the game. Otherwise, he or she is told the total number of digits correctly placed, but not specifically which ones and is given an opportunity to make the necessary changes. The actual price of the car is then revealed and the contestant wins if their guess matches the price. =One Right Price= The contestant is shown two prizes and a price corresponding to one of them. The contestant wins both prizes by correctly choosing the prize associated with the price. =One Wrong Price = The contestant is shown three prizes, each with accompanying prices. Two prices are correct and one is incorrect. The contestant wins everything by choosing the prize with the incorrect price. P =Pass the Buck= The game is played for a car and/or a cash prize of up to $9,000. The contestant is shown a board with six numbered spaces. Behind the numbers are one space marked with an image of a car, two spaces marked \\"Lose Everything,\\" and three spaces marked with cash values: $1,000, $3,000 and $5,000. The contestant is given one choice of a space at the start of the game and can earn two more. The contestant is shown two pairs of grocery items. Within each pair, one item is correctly priced, while the other has had its price reduced by $1. Each time the contestant correctly chooses a reduced-price item, he or she wins another choice from the board. The contestant then chooses one number at a time and can quit after any turn, keeping everything he or she has won to that point. Otherwise, the game ends when all choices have been used. Finding a \\"Lose Everything\\" space forfeits the accumulated winnings, but the contestant may continue to play if he or she still has any choices left. Early in the game's history, the board had eight spaces instead of six, a third \\"Lose Everything\\" space and a $2,000 cash award, and the maximum cash amount that could have been won without winning the car was $10,000. Additionally, the contestant was not given a free choice at the start of the game. Instead, a third pair of grocery items (for a total of six items) was used to earn a third choice. During this period, the game ended immediately if the contestant failed to win a choice. =Pathfinder= The game is played for a car. The gameboard features a five-by-five floor grid of 25 digits, on which the contestant must walk a five-step path to spell out the price of the car in order to win it. The contestant begins in the center square, which contains the first digit, and every correct square is horizontally or vertically adjacent to the one before it. Diagonal steps, backtracking, and stepping onto already-used squares are not allowed. If the contestant steps onto an incorrect digit at any time, he or she must back up to the last correct digit and earn a second chance by pricing one of three smaller prizes. The contestant chooses a prize and must choose the correct price from two options. If the contestant succeeds, he or she wins that prize and another chance to choose the next correct digit in the car's price. If the contestant fails to choose the correct price, he or she may try to win another second chance with a different prize. If the contestant steps on an incorrect digit with no small prizes remaining or guesses the incorrect price for the third small prize, the game ends. The game originally offered cars with four-digit prices and an asterisk was on the center square. Contestants had to step onto all four digits without being given a free digit. =Pay the Rent= This game is played using six grocery items and offers a top prize of $100,000. The main prop is a house with two stories, an attic, and a mailbox. The first and second stories each have space to hold two grocery items, while the attic and mailbox can each hold only one. The contestant is asked to arrange the grocery items in the house so that the total price of the item(s) on any level is higher than the total for the previous one, starting at the mailbox and working upward toward the attic. The contestant immediately receives $1,000 and the item prices are revealed, one level at a time. His or her winnings are increased each time that the total for a level is higher than the previous one: $5,000 for the first story, $10,000 for the second story, and $100,000 for the attic. The contestant may choose to stop the game at any time and keep all money won to that point. However, if a level total is lower than the previous one, the game ends and the contestant forfeits everything. =Pick-a-Number = The contestant is shown a prize and its price with one digit missing. The contestant wins the prize by correctly selecting the missing digit from three possible choices. =Pick-a-Pair = The contestant is shown six grocery items and must choose two whose prices are equal in order to win. If the first attempt is unsuccessful, the contestant may discard one of the two chosen items and make a second attempt to match the other one. The six items form three pairs of equal price. =Plinko= Plinko is played for up to $50,000. The contestant is given one free chip and can win up to four more by pricing smaller prizes. For each prize, the contestant is shown a price and must choose which digit of two displayed‚Äîthe first or the second‚Äîis correct. The contestant wins the small prize and an extra chip for choosing the correct digit. After pricing all of the items, the contestant places one chip at a time on a pegboard (styled similarly to a bean machine), where it eventually falls into one of nine spaces at the bottom. The values of these spaces are arranged symmetrically. From the outside in, the sequence is $100‚Äì$500‚Äì$1,000‚Äì$0, with the middle space worth $10,000. Once the chip falls into a space, the contestant wins the corresponding amount of money and the chip is removed from the board. If a chip becomes stuck on the board, it is knocked loose and returned to the contestant to drop again. The process is repeated until the supply of chips is exhausted, and the contestant wins the total amount of all spaces hit. Plinko debuted as a pricing game in January 1983. Originally, the center space was worth $5,000, with a potential top prize of $25,000. =Pocket Change= The game is played for a car. The contestant begins the game with $0.25, which is given as the car's initial selling price. Six digits are shown, five of which belong to the price of the car. The first digit in the price is revealed, and the contestant attempts to guess the remaining four digits, one at a time. Each incorrect choice raises the car's selling price by $0.25. When a digit is correctly chosen, it is removed from play and the contestant selects one of 20 envelopes from a gameboard without opening it. Each envelope contains a value between $0.00 and $2.00. After the contestant correctly guesses the fifth digit and selects a final envelope, the envelopes (four in all) are opened and the values inside are added to the initial bank of $0.25. If the bank total meets or exceeds the car's selling price, the contestant wins. The first time the game was played, the contestant was not given the first digit and was required to guess all five digits in the price, resulting in five envelopes to be added to the initial $0.25. =Punch-a- Bunch= The game is played for a top prize of $25,000. The contestant answers higher-or-lower pricing questions about four items, one at a time. Each correct answer earns a punch on a 5-by-10 punchboard. The contestant punches holes into the appropriate number of spaces on the board, each of which contains a slip of paper with an amount of money written on it. The host then reveals the amount written on each slip, one at a time, beginning with the first hole punched. One hole contains the $25,000 prize, while the others contain amounts ranging from $100 to $10,000. The contestant may either accept the amount on the slip and end the game, or discard it in favor of the next hole he/she punched. The game continues until the contestant either quits, wins the top prize, or reaches the last of their slips, in which case he or she must keep the last amount. Prior to September 29, 2011, four slips displayed both a cash amount and the message \\"Second Chance.\\" Finding one allowed the contestant to punch another hole immediately, and the value inside was added to the one on the Second Chance slip. While this rule was in effect, a contestant could win more than the top prize amount by finding it on a Second Chance punch. The top prize from September 27, 1978 to October 1, 2008 was $10,000, with $50 as the lowest amount on the board. Although the same pricing method was used to earn punches, the first 11 playings of Punch-a- Bunch used a different cash distribution and punch format. Each of the letters in the word \\"PUNCHBOARD\\" concealed a different number, with two each of 1 through 4 and one each of 5 and 10. After punching one of the letters, the contestant punched a hole in the field of 50 holes on the board. Twenty of the holes contained slips marked \\"Dollars\\", another 20 contained slips marked \\"Hundred\\" and the remaining 10 contained slips marked \\"Thousand\\". The number punched was multiplied by the phrase on the slip to determine the contestant's award (e.g., punching a ten and the word \\"Thousand\\" earned the contestant $10,000). =Push Over= The contestant is shown a prize and a series of nine numbered blocks which includes the correct price. A blue window, four blocks wide, is positioned at the far right end of a shelf, beyond which is a bin. The contestant wins the prize by pushing the entire row of blocks until the correct price is shown in the window. However, once blocks fall over the edge into the bin, they cannot be retrieved. This game has occasionally been played for cars and other prizes valued over $10,000, using a window wide enough to display a five-digit price. R =Race Game= The contestant is shown four prizes and given a set of tags with their prices. The contestant then has 45 seconds to match the prices with the correct prizes. To see how many he or she has correct, the contestant pulls a lever on a display which then lights up the number of correctly-placed tags. If the contestant has fewer than four right, he or she may rearrange the prices and pull the lever as often as time allows. Once time runs out, the contestant wins any prizes he or she has correctly priced at that point. =Range Game= A $600 range for the price of a prize is displayed as a vertical scale. A $150 range finder moves up the scale, starting from the bottom, and the contestant has one opportunity to stop it by pressing a button. If the range finder is covering the correct price when stopped, the contestant wins the prize. The original range was $50, but it was quickly increased to $100. The range was $200 for a brief period during the 1970s on the syndicated version of the show. =Rat Race= The contestant must price three items within specified ranges: a grocery item priced under $10 within $1; a small prize priced under $100 within $10; and a medium prize priced under $500 within $100. For each bid given within the correct range, the contestant chooses one of five colored mechanical rats (yellow, green, pink, orange and blue), which are positioned on a large dollar sign-shaped racetrack. The rats are then set in motion on the track and all five rats ultimately travel the same distance. The contestant wins a car, a large prize, or an additional medium-valued prize if a chosen rat finishes first, second, or third. More than one prize can be won, depending upon the number of rats chosen and how they finish the race. S =Safe Crackers= The contestant attempts to win two prizes by guessing the three-digit combination of a giant safe that contains both prizes. The combination is the same as the price of the less expensive prize. The contestant is given the three unique digits and must use each of them only once to determine the correct price in order to open the safe and win both prizes. =Secret \\"X\\" = This game is played on a giant tic-tac-toe board with a secret X hidden in the center column. At the start of the game, the contestant is given one free X to place anywhere in either the left or right column of the board. Two small prizes are then shown, each with two possible prices. Each time the contestant correctly prices a prize, he or she wins it and receives another X. After placing the additional X's, the secret X is revealed. The contestant wins the game and a large prize if he or she has formed a line of three either horizontally or diagonally. If the contestant earns no additional X's, the game ends immediately. Contestants cannot win the game by placing all three of their X's on the same column to create a vertical line; a winning line must include the secret X. =Shell Game= Played similarly to the carnival game of the same name, the game features four shells, one of which conceals a ball. The contestant is asked whether each of four prizes is actually priced higher or lower than a given incorrect price. For each correct guess, the contestant wins that small prize and a chip to place beside one of the shells. If the contestant places a chip beside the shell containing the ball, he or she wins a bonus prize. A contestant who correctly prices all four items automatically wins the prize, and can also win a cash amount equal to the prize value by correctly guessing which shell conceals the ball. Previously, this bonus was $500 on the daytime show, and $1,000 on the 1970s syndicated version. On the 1985‚Äì86 syndicated version, the bonus was originally $500, then $1,000. Eventually, it was awarded for correctly pricing all four items, without having to select the right shell. =Shopping Spree= The contestant is shown four prizes and chooses three of them, one at a time. If the total of their prices exceeds a given minimum amount, he or she wins everything. =Side by Side= This game is played for prize with a four-digit price. The contestant is shown a pair of two-digit numbers and must decide the order in which they should be placed to form the correct price (e.g. \\"75\\" and 42\\" can give options of $7,542 and $4,275). If the contestant chooses correctly, he/she wins the prize. =Spelling Bee= The game is played for a car or a cash prize of up to $5,000. A gameboard contains 30 cards: eleven Cs, eleven As, six Rs, and two \\"CAR\\"s. In order to win the car, the contestant must choose either one of each letter or a CAR card. The contestant chooses two free cards from the board and may win up to three more by pricing each of three small prizes within $10 of their actual prices, high or low. If the contestant guesses any price exactly, he/she automatically wins all three prizes and cards, even if he/she had missed on previous guesses. After the cards are chosen, the contestant is offered $1,000 per card to quit the game and walk away. The cards are revealed one at a time. If the car is not yet won, the cash buyout offer is repeated with the remaining cards. The contestant wins nothing if he or she fails to spell CAR or get one of the two CAR cards after the last card is revealed. If the contestant does win the car, however, he or she does not receive cash for any remaining cards. Prior to 2007, each card was worth $500, for a maximum buyout of $2,500. =Squeeze Play= The contestant is shown a prize and a price that has had one incorrect digit inserted; the first and last digits are always correct. To win the prize, the contestant must remove the extra middle digit to leave behind the correct price. This game has been played for prizes with four- and five-digit prices, giving the contestant a choice between three and four middle digits, respectively. =Stack the Deck= The game is played for a car. The contestant is shown seven playing cards containing digits, five of which make up the price of the car. Three pairs of grocery items are displayed, and the contestant must guess which item in each pair corresponds to a given price. Each correct guess allows him/her to fill in one correct digit in the price of the car. After all three pairs have been played, the contestant has one chance to win the car by correctly filling in all remaining digits. =Swap Meet= The contestant is shown a base prize and three more prizes. In order to win all four, he or she must \\"swap\\" the base prize by choosing the prize from the group of three whose price is the same as the base prize. =Switch? = The contestant is shown two prizes, each with a price. The contestant must decide whether the prices are correct as shown or need to be switched with each other. A correct decision wins both prizes. =Switcheroo= This game is played for a car and four additional prizes under $100. The contestant is shown the prices for the five prizes, each of which is missing its tens digit, and given five blocks with the missing digits. The contestant has 30 seconds to complete the prices using these blocks. After either the time limit expires or the contestant is satisfied, the number of correct prices is revealed, but not specifically which ones. If all five prices are correct, the contestant immediately wins everything. If fewer than five are correct, he or she may take another 30 seconds to change the prices if desired, or leave them as they are. The extra time is given by default if none of the prices are correct. Once the game ends, due to the contestant either using the extra 30 seconds or leaving the prices alone, he/she wins all prizes that are correctly priced. T =Take Two= The contestant is shown four prizes and a target total. He or she has two chances to win everything by choosing the two whose prices match the total when added together. =Temptation= The contestant is shown the first digit in the price of a car and is then presented with four additional prizes, each of which has only two distinct digits in its price. As each prize is presented, the contestant selects one digit from its price to fill in the price of the car. After the last prize is shown, he or she is given a chance to change any digits and must then make another choice: take the four prizes and quit the game, or risk them and try for the car. If the contestant tries for the car and has the correct price, he or she wins everything. If any digits are incorrect, he or she loses everything. Originally, when the game was played for cars with four-digit prices, the first digit was not given. Also, early playings of the game included prizes with three different digits in their prices as well as prizes with two-digit prices. In addition, when the game debuted, contestants were not given the option to change any digits after making their initial selections. =10 Chances= The contestant is given ten chances to correctly price three prizes. The first has a two-digit price, the second a three-digit price, and the third is a car. The contestant is given three unique digits for the first prize and must guess the price using two of them. The process repeats for the second prize, with four digits given to the contestant. For the car, the contestant is given five digits and must use all of them to guess its price. No digit may be repeated in any guess. The game ostensibly includes a ten-second time limit for writing down each choice, though this is rarely enforced. The contestant wins any prizes that he or she has correctly priced after all ten chances are used. Originally, the game used cars with four digits in the price and the contestant had to use four of the five available digits in each guess. =That's Too Much= The contestant is shown up to ten prices for a car in ascending order, one at a time. The contestant wins the car by correctly identifying the first revealed price which is higher than the actual price by calling out \\"That's Too Much!\\" =3 Strikes= The contestant is shown eight baseballs: five marked with digits in the price of a car and three \\"strike\\" balls marked with an X. The balls are placed into a hopper and mixed, and the contestant blindly draws one ball at a time. If a digit is drawn, the contestant must guess where it belongs in the price. If correct, the digit appears in that position on the gameboard and the ball is removed from play. If incorrect, the ball is returned to the hopper without penalty. If a strike is drawn, an X is lit up in the strike display on the gameboard and the ball is removed from play. To win the car, the contestant must fill in every digit before drawing all three strikes. Prior to 2018, discs were used rather than baseballs, and they were placed in a bag rather than a hopper. When the game began in 1976, there were seven discs in the bag: the four digits of the price and the three strikes. As the value of cars went past $10,000 in the mid-1980s, the game was briefly known as 3 Strikes + when cars priced above $10,000 were first offered. Since 1993, the game has been played for vehicles priced at least $30,000, typically luxury vehicles, premium trucks, or electric cars. Since 2013, cars priced above $100,000 have occasionally been offered; in these playings, a sixth disc or ball with the extra digit is used. From 1998 to 2008, only one strike chip was used, and it was returned to the bag after being drawn. The contestant lost by drawing the strike chip three times. During a brief period during Season 37 (2008), the first digit in the price was lit at the beginning of the game, with chips representing the remaining four digits plus the three strike chips placed in the bag. =Time Is Money= The contestant is shown five grocery items that must be placed on tables with specific price ranges: $0 to $2.99, $3 to $5.99, and $6 and higher. The contestant is given ten seconds and one chance to place all five items in their proper categories. Doing so correctly awards $20,000. If the contestant fails to place them correctly, he or she is given 40 seconds to make changes, with the potential prize decreasing steadily at a rate of $500 per second. The contestant may rearrange items as often as time permits, and must press a button after each attempt to learn the result. If he or she places the items correctly, the clock is stopped and he or she wins any remaining money. The contestant is never told how many items or which ones are correctly placed. The revamped game premiered on September 22, 2014. Under the original rules the game was played for a large prize and $500 instead of $20,000 cash. The contestant had 15 seconds to correctly group all of the items. If the contestant was correct, he or she also won $500 in addition to the prize. If unsuccessful, the contestant could stop playing and keep the $500, or exchange it for another 15 seconds to regroup the items, without knowing how many items were incorrectly placed or which ones. After two playings, the rules were changed to remove the $500 bonus and offer the contestant two chances to correctly place the items, with a 20-second time limit for each chance. If any were placed incorrectly after the first chance, the contestant was told how many items were incorrectly placed (although not specifically which individual products were placed correctly). If the contestant was incorrect on the second chance, the game ended and he or she won nothing. =Triple Play= Triple Play is the only game to regularly offer three cars. The contestant is shown two price choices for the first car, three for the second and four for the third. For each car, the contestant must choose which of the displayed prices is closest to the actual price of the car without going over. The contestant may not stop the game after correctly pricing the first or second car. If the contestant chooses correctly for all three cars, he or she wins everything. If the contestant chooses incorrectly at any point, the game ends and he or she wins nothing. =2 for the Price of 1= The game is played for two prizes, one of which has three digits in its price. The contestant must select which of two digits displayed is the correct digit in each position of the price. The contestant is offered a free digit of his or her choice and then selects which of the remaining digits are correct. If the contestant correctly determines the price, he or she wins both prizes. V =Vend-O-Price= Three grocery items are displayed on separate shelves of a gameboard resembling a vending machine, from top to bottom in increasing order of price. The contestant inserts a coin into the machine, and the shelves' sliding doors open to reveal a different quantity of each item. In order to win, the contestant must choose the shelf with the highest total price, based on the price for one unit multiplied by the number of items on its shelf. Inactive games When the 1972 version of the show premiered, many games did not have official names which were used on the air. Some of the names below are unofficial or assigned by the production staff. A =Add 'Em Up= The contestant was shown a car whose price contained four unique digits and was told their sum. He/she chose one digit to be revealed and had to guess the other three, one at a time and in any order. The total of all correctly guessed digits was shown on the gameboard. In order to win the car, the contestant had to guess all of the missing digits before making two mistakes. B =Balance Game= Five small prizes were presented and the contestant was given five \\"Barker silver dollar\\" coins. The contestant attempted to balance a scale with a combination of prizes added to each side. The contestant chose one prize at a time and assigned it to either the left or right side of the scale. Coins representing the value of the prize were placed on the side selected. If the totals of the prizes on both sides matched at any time, the contestant won a larger prize package. If the totals agreed to within $5, he or she could use the provided coins to balance the scale and win. Regardless of the outcome, the contestant kept any prizes he or she chose during the game as well as any unused coins. =Bullseye= The contestant was given seven chances to guess the actual price of a car. In response to each guess, the host told the contestant whether the actual price was higher or lower. In some appearances of the game, the contestant was given a $500 range into which the price fell. =Bump= The contestant was shown two prizes and a British-themed gameboard containing four double-decker buses, each marked with a price. The far left and far right buses displayed the same price, and the prizes' names were placed below the two middle buses. A model stood at each end of the row, and the contestant chose one of them to bump the buses, resulting in either the leftmost or rightmost two coming to rest above the prize names and the others being removed/knocked from the board. The contestant won both prizes if the buses' prices matched those of the prizes below them. =Buy or Sell= Three prizes were shown, each with an incorrect price. The contestant bought prizes he or she believed were under- priced and sold prizes he or she believed were overpriced. The actual prices were then revealed, one at a time. For each correct decision, the difference between the two prices was added to a bank. For each incorrect decision, the difference was subtracted from the bank. If the contestant had a positive bank balance at the end of the game, he/she won everything as well as any money accumulated in the bank. The most money that could be accumulated was $1,900. Prior to 1997, winning contestants did not receive any money accumulated. C =Clearance Sale= Three prizes were shown and the contestant was given three price tags, each of which bore a sale price lower than one of the items' actual retail price. The contestant placed a price tag on each prize and won everything if each of the sale prices was below the actual price of its respective prize. =Credit Card= Five prizes were shown, each usually worth between $200 and $3,000. The contestant was then presented with a large credit card, which was inserted into an ATM, which then displayed a credit limit (usually $1,800 to $2,500). The contestant then chose three prizes, one at a time, and their prices were deducted from the credit limit. If the contestant did not exceed the limit with the three choices, he/she won everything. D =Double Bullseye= The original Bullseye game was reworked into a two-player format after never producing a winner. In doing so, the game became the only pricing game which guaranteed a winner. After the first contestant won his or her way on stage, another contestant was called from the audience, and another item went up for bids. After the second contestant won his or her way on stage, the car was shown. Barker asked each one to give him a bid on the price of the car after giving a price range of $500. He then told the opponent whether the price was higher or lower than the bid, and the two alternated until one gave the exact price, winning the car. Australia's version of The Price is Right used this format for their Showcase round. Hosts Ian Turpie or Larry Emdur gave a price range and asked the two contestants to bid in the same manner. Whoever gave the exact price won the opportunity to play for the showcase. =Double Digits= A car was shown along with four small prizes. For each small prize, the contestant was shown the second digit in that prize's price, and then two possibilities for the first digit. The contestant attempted to select the correct first digit in the price, which also corresponded to a digit in the car's price. If the four correct digits had been chosen, the contestant won everything. If the contestant failed to win the car, he or she still won any small prizes which were priced correctly. F =Finish Line= Six small prizes were described in three pairs. For each pair, the contestant tried to pick the more expensive item. The sum of the prices of the rejected prizes made up a finish line that a miniature horse and jockey would have to cross. After all three choices were made, the horse moved one step for each dollar in the total value of the prizes the contestant had selected. If the horse passed the finish line, the contestant won a larger prize. Regardless of the outcome, the contestant kept the three chosen prizes. =Fortune Hunter= Fortune Hunter was played for four prizes and $5,000. It involved four boxes, one of which contained the cash prize. The host read three clues to help the contestant eliminate the prizes associated with them, based on their prices. The remaining box was then opened. If the cash was hidden inside, the contestant won everything. However, if the chosen box was empty, the contestant won nothing. The contestant did not have to eliminate the prizes in the order the clues were read. The prizes could be eliminated in any order, as long as only the box that contained the money was left. G =Gallery Game= A painting of a prize was shown to the contestant. Below the painting was a price, which was missing part of one digit. The contestant won by correctly painting in that digit. =Give or Keep= Six small prizes were presented in three pairs. From each pair, the contestant picked what he believed was the more expensive prize. If the sum of the prices of the prizes the contestant kept was equal to or greater than the sum of the prices of the prizes they gave away, the contestant won a larger prize. Regardless of the outcome, the contestant won the three prizes they chose to keep. H =Hit Me= The contestant played blackjack against the house, trying to get as close to 21 as possible without going over (busting). Before the game began, the contestant cut a deck of oversized playing cards and two were dealt out as the house's starting hand, the first one face down as a hole card. The contestant was then shown six grocery items, each of which displayed a price that was equal to its actual price multiplied by a whole number from 1 to 10. Each item had a card hidden underneath it, whose value was equal to that item's multiplier. One of the six items displayed its actual price and would give an ace if chosen, while another showed a price multiplied by 10. Aces could count as 1 or 11. The contestant chose items and received their cards until he or she either reached a total of 21, busted, or chose to stop. Reaching 21 with any combination of cards was an automatic win, regardless of the house's hand. If the contestant stopped, the house's hole card was revealed and, if necessary, additional cards were dealt from the deck until its total reached 17 or higher. The contestant won if his or her total matched or exceeded the house's total without busting, or if the house busted. If the contestant busted, he or she immediately lost the game. Situations involving an ace in the house's hand (whether it should be counted as one or eleven even when the result would be in favor of the house) were handled inconsistently over the course of the game's time on the show. =Hurdles= A grocery item was described, and its price was attached to a runner figure on a gameboard. The contestant was shown three pairs of items and asked to choose the one in each pair that he/she believed was lower in price than the base item; each choice was marked with a blue flag. Once he/she had made all three choices, a starter's pistol was fired and the runner began to move across the board, with a hurdle rising from each chosen item as he approached it. If the contestant chose correctly, the hurdle would stop rising in time for the runner to clear it. If the runner cleared all three hurdles, the contestant won the game and a large prize. However, if the contestant chose incorrectly at any point, the runner would crash into that item's hurdle and the game ended. I =It's Optional= Two cars were shown, each of the same make and model. The contestant was told the second car was priced a set amount higher than the first and told the difference in the two prices, then shown a list of a list of nine options. Selecting options one at a time, the contestant attempted to increase the price of the first car to within $100 of the price of the second car without going over. The number of options a contestant was allowed to choose during the course of the game changed each time it was played but was generally between three and five. J =Joker= The contestant was shown a hand of five face-down cards, one of which was a joker. Four small prizes were presented, each with a displayed price. For each one, the contestant had to decide whether or not to reverse the digits in order to obtain the correct price (e.g. $37 or $73). Each correct choice awarded that prize and allowed the contestant to discard one card from the hand. He/she won the game if the joker was found among the discards. M =Make Your Mark = Three prizes were shown along with four prices on a gameboard. The contestant was given $500 and chose the three prices he/she believed were correct, using a marker to note each selection. Two correct prices were revealed among the three marked ones and matched to their prizes, and the contestant then had to decide whether to leave the last marker where it was, or return the $500 and switch the marker to the one un-chosen price. If the contestant chose correctly, he/she won all three prizes and kept the $500 if he/she had not returned it. If the third choice was incorrect, the contestant won nothing. The game was originally titled Barker's Markers in reference to former host Bob Barker, but was re-titled Make Your Mark after Drew Carey took over as host and during the game's single appearance on the 1994 syndicated version hosted by Doug Davidson. On the October 9, 2008 episode, the only playing of Make Your Mark in season 37, Drew Carey incorrectly explained the rules that the contestant was allowed to keep the $500 regardless of whether or not they ultimately won the game, so long as they did not change the last marker. =Mystery Price= A prize package was presented to the contestant and the price of the least expensive item in the package was dubbed the \\"mystery price\\". Four smaller prizes were shown individually and the contestant placed a bid on each of them. If their bid was equal to or lower than the item's actual price, the contestant won that prize and the amount of their bid was placed into a bank. If the contestant overbid on the prize, it was lost and no value was added to the bank. After all four small prizes were played, the mystery price was revealed. The contestant won the larger prize package in addition to any small prizes they did not overbid on if the bank was equal to or greater than the mystery price. O =On the Nose= In order to win a car, the contestant competed in one of five possible sporting events. The events varied each time the game was played and included throwing a baseball or football into a specified area, shooting a basketball into a hoop, hitting a tennis ball with a racket into a specified area or popping a balloon with a dart. After being shown the car, the contestant was presented with four possible prices. The contestant selected the one they believed was the actual price of the car and, if correct, won a $1,000 bonus and four attempts at the sporting event preselected for that day. The further away the selected price was from the actual price, the fewer attempts at the sporting event the contestant received with no bonus. If the contestant succeeded in the sporting event, he or she won the car. =On the Spot= Six small prizes were described and the contestant was shown three paths, colored blue, yellow and pink, extending outward from a center black spot. Each path was marked with three prices. To win a car, the contestant attempted to match the three prices in any path to the six prizes in play. After choosing a path, the contestant had to correctly determine which prize was associated with each price along the path in turn. If the contestant made a mistake, they returned to the center spot and chose a new path. Making mistakes on all three paths ended the game. The contestant won any prizes he/she correctly priced. Some of the prices on a path were repeated on other paths, and the contestant could automatically step to the next price along the path if he or she had already correctly matched the associated prize on a previous path. P =Penny Ante= Two grocery items were described. For each item, four possible prices were presented. The contestant was given three oversized pennies and attempted to select the correct price for each item, one at a time. Each mistake the contestant made cost him or her a penny. The contestant won a larger prize if he or she was able to guess the actual price of both items before losing all three pennies. The first five times the game was played, the board was not divided into halves for each grocery item. Instead, the two correct prices were hidden among all eight choices. Whenever an incorrect price was guessed, one penny fell from the side of the gameboard into a bucket for each cent in the amount of the guess. A scoreboard was attached to the front of the gameboard, which kept track of the pennies accumulated. The contestant lost the game if the total of the incorrect guesses made before finding the two correct prices equaled 100 pennies or more. =The Phone Home Game= The contestant and a preselected home viewer competing via telephone teamed to attempt to win up to $15,000. Before the game began, the home viewer was given a list of the actual prices for each of seven grocery items. The items were then described to the contestant and the home viewer gave a price for one of the items. The contestant selected the item he or she believed matched that price. If the contestant was correct, the team shared a hidden cash award associated with that specific product. If the contestant was incorrect, both the guessed product and the correct product were removed from play and their cash awards were lost. The contestant and home viewer attempted to make three correct matches and win three cash awards. If the home viewer read the name of a grocery item at any time instead of a price, that turn was lost. The cash awards for the matched products were revealed and the team split the total amount won. The cash awards hidden beside the seven products included one each of $10,000, $3,000, and $2,000, and two each of $1,000 and $200. =Poker Game= Four prizes were shown, all with three-digit prices. The contestant selected two of the prizes and the digits in their prices were used to form the best possible five-card poker hand, with nines high and zeroes low. After the hand was revealed, the contestant chose either to keep it or pass it to the house. The prices of the other two prizes were then revealed and assembled into a second poker hand. If the contestant had a better hand than the house, he or she won everything. The hand rankings were similar to those of poker and were, from highest to lowest: five of a kind, four of a kind, full house, three of a kind, two pair, one pair, and high card. However, straights did not count, and without suits, flushes were not possible. In early playings, the contestant was allowed to make their hand with any five of the six digits of the prices of the two prizes they had chosen, but did not have the option to pass their chosen hand to the house. =Professor Price= The last two digits in the price of a car were revealed, and the contestant was asked a series of general knowledge questions with single-digit numerical answers. (Example: \\"How many ounces are there in half a pound?\\" ‚Äì answer: 8.) After each question, the contestant had to guess whether that digit was one of the first two in the price. If it was, it was revealed whether the contestant guessed correctly or not. The contestant won the car for giving three correct answers/guesses, or lost for missing three. A large animatronic puppet known as Professor Price was central to the game. The contestant's progress was tracked by the puppet's hands, with correct answers/guesses counted by upward- pointing fingers on the right hand and incorrect ones counted by downward- pointing fingers on the left. As with the Clock Game, the audience was required to remain silent while the game was in progress. The game was played only twice, making it the shortest-lived game in the show's history. It was also the only game to have a perfect record, having been won both times it was played. S =Shower Game= The contestant was shown six shower stalls, each marked with a possible price for a car. Three stalls contained confetti, two contained $100 in one-dollar bills, and the one with the actual price contained a giant car key. The contestant entered a stall and pulled its chain, triggering the release of its contents. Finding confetti allowed him or her to choose again. As soon as the contestant found either the $100 or the car, the game ended and he or she won that prize. =Split Decision= A car and a medium prize were shown and a string of eight digits was displayed on a gameboard. The numbers in the prices of the prizes appeared in order but were not necessarily placed side by side. The contestant was given 20 seconds to pull down the three digits that made up the price of the smaller prize, leaving the five digits that made up the price of the car. To stop the clock, the contestant pushed a button on the gameboard. If the correct three-digit price for the smaller prize had been pulled down, the contestant won both prizes. If incorrect, the contestant continued guessing until a correct guess was made or time ran out. A later variation in the rules did not feature a clock. Instead, the contestant was given only three chances to win. =Step Up= The contestant had a chance to win up to four prizes and $3,000 cash. He/she selected one prize, whose price was immediately revealed, then attempted to choose a more expensive one. A correct choice awarded both prizes and $500, after which the contestant could either stop the game or try to choose a still more expensive prize. If this choice was correct, he/she also won the third prize and an additional $1,000 and had the same choice to stop or continue. If the contestant continued, and the last prize was the most expensive of all, he/she won it as well and an additional $1,500. However, an incorrect guess at any time ended the game and the contestant lost everything. =Super Ball!!= The contestant had a chance to win up to three large prizes by rolling balls up a skee ball ramp. The ball for each large prize was presented alongside a small prize displaying two possible prices. If the contestant chose the correct price, he/she won that small prize and earned the corresponding ball. The ramp contained three rings: $50 and $100, which awarded those cash amounts, and WIN, which awarded the large prize for that ball. The contestant was given a practice ball to roll before attempting to win any of the large prizes. A fourth small prize was then revealed. If the contestant priced it correctly, he/she won it and earned a \\"Super Ball.\\" Rolling the Super Ball into the WIN ring awarded all three large prizes, while rolling it into either cash ring awarded triple the marked value. If the contestant had already won all three large prizes, he/she could earn a $3,000 bonus by rolling the Super Ball into the WIN ring. =Super Saver= Six grocery items were presented, five marked below their actual retail price and one marked above. The contestant chose four of the items, one at a time, and the difference between the marked price and the actual price was added to a bank. Choosing the overpriced item deducted that difference from the bank. The contestant won the game by saving a total of at least $1 after the four choices. Even if the overpriced item was chosen, it was always mathematically possible to win the game by selecting three products with the largest differences below the actual prices. Also, the contestant was required to choose four items even if the bank total exceeded $1 after the first two or three selections. T =Telephone Game= A car and two smaller prizes were shown, along with four grocery items. The contestant was given $1 to purchase two of the four grocery items, attempting to spend no more than 90¬¢ so that he or she would have a dime left in order to use a pay telephone. If the contestant succeeded, he or she dialed one of three given four-digit telephone numbers and won the prize whose price was associated with that number, indicated by a model answering the telephone placed next to it. The number for the car represented its price in dollars, while the numbers for the two small prizes represented their prices in dollars and cents. The contestant won nothing if their grocery item purchase exceeded 90¬¢. =Trader Bob= The contestant was presented with one small prize and was then shown three pairs of additional prizes. By choosing one prize from each pair in the order they were presented, the contestant attempted to \\"trade up\\" from that initial prize and create a sequence of four prizes in ascending order of price. If the contestant successfully traded up with all three choices, he or she won both the last small prize chosen and a larger prize package. If not, the contestant won only the first small prize chosen that was lower in price than the one before it. W =Walk of Fame= The contestant could win up to four prizes by guessing their prices within a set range, high or low. The prizes were presented in order of increasing value, and the winning range increased from one to the next. If the contestant missed on any of the first three prizes, he/she was given a choice of two autograph books signed by the show's cast. One book also contained a page marked \\"Second Chance\\". If the contestant chose this book, he/she moved on to the next prize, but the one he/she had missed was taken out of play. The game ended once the contestant made a second mistake, failed to choose the \\"Second Chance\\" book, or made a mistake on the fourth prize. Special rule changes Rules to certain pricing games have occasionally been changed on special episodes.  1986 summer specials  * \\"Clock Game\\" ‚Äì After winning both prizes the contestant blindly chose a cash bonus from one of four envelopes with possible values of $1,000, $2,000, $3,000 and $5,000. * \\"Hole in One (or Two)\\" ‚Äì The bonus for correctly ordering all six items was $1,000.  2002‚Äì08 prime time specials  * \\"Clock Game\\" ‚Äì The bonus for winning both prizes within 30 seconds was increased to $5,000. * \\"Grand Game\\" ‚Äì The top prize was increased to $20,000, with the winnings ranging from $2, $20, $200, and $2,000. * \\"1/2 Off\\" ‚Äì The top prize was increased to $25,000. * \\"Hole in One (or Two)\\" ‚Äì The bonus for correctly ordering all six items was $1,000. * \\"It's In the Bag\\" ‚Äì The last bag's value was increased to $24,000. * \\"Plinko\\" ‚Äì The game was played for $100,000, with the middle slot increased to $20,000. * \\"Punch a Bunch\\" ‚Äì The top prize was originally $25,000, then later increased to $50,000. During episodes of The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular, contestants had an opportunity to win the $1 million bonus in the showcase showdown for spinning a $1.00 in their bonus spin. If no contestant earned a bonus spin in either showcase showdown, the ultimate winner of the showcase would be given the opportunity to spin the big wheel for a $1 million bonus. If no contestant earned a bonus spin and both contestants overbid in the showcase, a new contestant would be called from the audience at the end of the show to spin the big wheel for a $1 million bonus; this was later changed to allow the contestant who made the smaller overbid to spin. The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular In 2008, episodes of The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular featured rule changes to some pricing games which awarded a $1 million bonus to the contestant for achieving specific goals. * \\"Clock Game\\" ‚Äì The contestant was required to guess the retail prices of both prizes within a total of 10 seconds to win the bonus. Winning both prizes awarded $5,000 regardless of how much time was left on the clock. * \\"Cover Up\\", \\"One Away\\" ‚Äì The contestant was required to guess all five digits in the car's price correctly on his/her first attempt to win the bonus. * \\"1/2 Off\\" ‚Äì A contestant who found the $25,000 could either quit or risk it for a chance at the bonus. A $1 million check was hidden in one of the other 15 boxes, and the contestant had one chance to guess where it was. An incorrect guess forfeited the $25,000. * \\"Plinko\\" ‚Äì If at least three chips landed in the $20,000 slot, the contestant was given a golden Plinko chip. If the golden chip landed in the $20,000 slot, the contestant won the bonus. Otherwise, the contestant won the money amount associated with where the chip landed. * \\"Punch a Bunch\\" ‚Äì The contestant could win the bonus by finding the $50,000 prize with their first punch. * \\"Range Game\\" ‚Äì After stopping the range finder, the contestant provided a guess for the exact price of the prize. If the correct price fell within the $150 range, the contestant won the prize. If their exact guess matched the actual retail price of the prize, the contestant also won the bonus. * \\"Safe Crackers\\" ‚Äì After winning the game under the standard rules, the contestant could quit with the prizes won (one of which was always a car) or risk them to try for the bonus. The safe was re-locked with a new five-digit combination that was the same as the price of the car. Each dial contained the same five digits. However, each digit did not necessarily appear in the price of the car, and the contestant was told the price of the car could potentially contain repeated digits. Setting the correct combination won the bonus, while an incorrect combination forfeited everything. * \\"Switcheroo\\" ‚Äì The contestant could win the bonus by correctly pricing all five prizes within the initial 30 seconds. Specially-themed episodes Starting in 2012, rule changes were also made to some pricing games for episodes with special themes, mostly Big Money Week, Dream Car Week, or episodes where viewers could choose game options via Twitter. The changes were as follows: * \\"Bonkers\\" ‚Äì During Big Money Week, contestants that win the game also win $1,000 for each second remaining on the clock. * \\"Bonus Game\\" ‚Äì During the 2017 Dream Car Week, both a car and a prize are offered for winning the game.

However, the contestant could choose to have the windmill removed and instead play the game for $20,000. * \\"Hot Seat\\" ‚Äì During Big Money Week, money levels increase to $2,500, $5,000, $10,000, $25,000 and $100,000. * \\"It's in the Bag\\" ‚Äì During Big Money Week (aired November 11, 2014 and October 16, 2019), the first bag is worth $5,000, and this amount is doubled for each subsequent bag, for a potential top prize of $80,000. In another playing aired February 20, 2018, the first bag is valued $2,000, and this amount is doubled for each subsequent bag, for a potential top prize of $32,000. * \\"Let 'Em Roll\\" ‚Äì During Big Money Week (and one playing during the Dream Car Week), the game is played for a cash prize of $100,000 instead of a car. Each cube has three dollar signs, with the other sides showing values of $2,500, $5,000 and $10,000.

In another playing during Big Money Week, while it is still played for a car, the values were doubled to $1,000, $2,000 and $3,000. * \\"Lucky Seven\\" ‚Äì On a playing aired January 4, 2019, in commemoration with The Bold & the Beautiful 's 8000th episode, the contestant was given an extra dollar at the beginning of the game, and was still required to save at least $1 to win the game. * \\"Master Key\\" ‚Äì During Big Money Week, cash values of $5,000, $15,000, and $30,000 were associated with the three locks instead of prizes, allowing a potential maximum of $50,000 for finding the Master Key. * \\"Plinko\\" ‚Äì The rules were modified multiple times for specially-themed episodes: ** From April 9 through 13, 2012, in conjunction with Publishers Clearing House, the game was played daily and featured a growing jackpot for the final chip. If the last chip landed in the center slot, the contestant won $20,000 instead of the usual $10,000 prize. However, if the last chip did not land in the center slot, another $20,000 was added to the jackpot on the next episode. ** During Big Money Week the game is played for up to $1,000,000, with the centre slot increased to $200,000. In the first two playings (aired on April 26 and October 18, 2013, the game was played for $500,000, with a $100,000 slot replacing the normal $10,000 center slot. In the three most recent playing (aired February 20 and October 10, 2018, and October 14, 2019), while the top prize is still $1,000,000, the slots for $100, $500, $1,000 and $10,000 spaces were changed to $500, $1,000, $2,500 and $200,000. ** For the game's 30th anniversary, Plinko was played six times on the episode which aired September 27, 2013. In two of the playings, the $10,000 slot was replaced with a car. A third playing saw the $10,000 slot replaced with a trip to London, England. In two of the six playings, the two $1,000 slots were replaced with prizes priced in the four digit range. If a non-cash prize was won by having a chip land in the slot, the slot reverted to its normal cash prize once it was hit again. ** On the episode which aired February 19, 2015, during a special Twitter-themed episode, viewers voted before the taping to either change the center slot from $10,000 to $25,000, or change the values of the two $100 slots to $10,000. ** During a 2016 episode celebrating the CBS network's 30 years of success as the top daytime network, the $10,000 slot was upgraded to $30,000, which yielded a top prize of $150,000. ** During a playing on February 3, 2017, the slots for $100, $500 and $1,000 were changed to $500, $1,000 and $2,500; other values were remained the same. ** During a playing on January 3, 2018 (and again on the Best of 2018 special aired December 31), in conjunction with the game's 35th anniversary, the slots for $100/$1,000, $500 and $10,000 were changed to $3,500, $350 and $35,000 (the top prize also increased to $175,000 as well). ** During a playing on December 21, 2018, the slots for $100, $500, $1,000 and $10,000 were changed to $500, $1,000, $2,500 and $50,000 (the top prize also increased to $250,000 as well). * \\"Pass The Buck\\" ‚Äì During the Big Money Week aired October 12, 2018, in replacement of a car prize, the values were replaced with cash values of $5,000, $10,000, $15,000 and $25,000, with three picks totalling a maximum $50,000. The two \\"Lose Everything\\" cards remained. * \\"Pay The Rent\\" ‚Äì During the Big Money Week aired February 23, 2018, the value of the attic was increased to $200,000; values for the other levels were unchanged. Pay The Rent was also played during the Big Money Week which aired April 24, 2013, but the top prize remained at $100,000. * \\"Punch a Bunch\\" ** During Big Money Week, either a $50,000 or $250,000 award replaces the $25,000 award. ** During an episode of Dream Car Week aired in May 2017 and February 2020, two of the $100 money slips were replaced by slips that said \\"CAR\\". ** On a playing aired September 26, 2018, in conjunction with the game's 40th anniversary, the award was increased to $40,000. * \\"Race Game\\" ‚Äì During Big Money Week, if contestant wins the game in less than 30 seconds, he or she also wins a $10,000 bonus. * \\"Range Game\\" ‚Äì During Big Money Week, a second $50 range was placed in the middle of $150 range. If the price falls into the $50 range, the contestant not only wins the game but also wins a $10,000 bonus. * \\"Rat Race\\" ** During Big Money Week, instead of offering a prize for each rat, a different cash award is offered depending upon how the contestant's chosen rat finished. Each playing with this modification featured different amounts for win, place and show. On the November 14, 2014 episode, prizes of $100,000, $50,000 and $25,000 were offered, with a perfect game totaling $175,000. ** On February 16, 2015, during a Twitter-themed episode, viewers voted Rat Race over Grand Game as the $100,000 game, and prizes offered were $75,000, $15,000 and $10,000 for win, place and show. * \\"Shell Game\\" ‚Äì During Big Money Week, a cash prize of $50,000 is offered for winning the game.

Correspondingly, the prize available decreases by $5,000 per second if the contestant does not place all five products correctly on his or her first try. In addition, theme weeks also had several changes: *During the Big Money Week: **In season 44's Big Money Week aired in October 2015, any contestant who won their game received an additional bonus of $5,000, and the prize for spinning $1.00 during a contestant's bonus spin in the Showcase Showdown was increased from $25,000 to $50,000. **In season 45's Big Money Week in October 2016, the 45-cent space on the wheel was colored in green and was worth $45,000 if it was hit in a bonus spin, and later in Season 46, the bonus award for bonus spin were doubled (i.e. green spaces are worth $20,000 and the $1.00 is worth $50,000), and winning a Pricing Game (except for games played with cash) would win an additional $5,000 bonus. **In season 47's Big Money Week, contestants winning a Pricing Game (except for games played with cash) would win cash based on the prize's monetary value. **In season 48's Big Money Week, the monetary value of all non-cash winnings from the pricing games they won will accumulate in a progressive jackpot, which was won by the winner of their showcase for the day. *Some Dream Car Week Showcase Showdowns (since Season 43) replaced the $25,000 bonus spin prize with a car. *In weeks sponsored by Publishers Clearing House, the contestant who won the day's first pricing game was awarded $20,000. *Three celebrity charity Weeks have aired, in 2012, 2013, and 2017. A different celebrity appeared on each episode to assist the contestants in their pricing games, and the show donated enough money to the celebrity's favorite charity to match the total winnings of all contestants. In addition, the celebrity spun the Big Wheel once during the second Showcase Showdown, and the result was multiplied by 100 and added to the donation (e.g. a spin of 60 cents added $6,000). *During the Premiere weeks since Season 46: **In Season 46 (in conjunction with Drew Carey's 10th anniversary as host), a contestant could win $10,000 for spinning a dollar during the Showcase Showdown; in the premiere episode (aired September 18, 2017), while pricing game winners wins an additional $10,000 bonus, spinning $1.00 in the bonus spin also awards the contestant a $100,000 bonus. **During Season 47's Premiere episode (aired September 17, 2018), in honour on the eighth Daytime Emmy Award win for the Outstanding Game Show, the bonus for spinning $1.00 before the bonus spin was increased to $8,000, while landing on the $1.00 in the bonus spin was increased to $80,000. **During the first week of Season 48 (September 23 to September 27, 2019), the first contestant to win a pricing game on each episode received a bonus prize in addition to his/her other winnings. *During the 9,000th milestone episode (aired October 10, 2019), contestants winning a Pricing Game won a $9,000 bonus. During the episode's showcase showdown, the $1.00 bonus before the bonus spin was increased to $9,000. Mash-up Week For each episode which aired during the week of May 9, 2016 and March 23, 2020, one of the games from Let's Make a Deal was imported to The Price is Right and played as a pricing game. The rules were modified slightly to require the contestants to price items. * \\"Car Pong\\" ‚Äì The contestant was shown four small prizes, one of which was priced at a stated amount, and tried to pick the other three, one at a time. Each correct choice added five seconds to a base time of five seconds, but an incorrect choice revealed a Zonk and ended this phase of the game immediately. The contestant then stood at one end of a table and tried to bounce ping-pong balls into a set of nine cups arranged in a diamond formation at the other end, using the accumulated time (a maximum of 20 seconds). Landing a ball in the center cup won a car; the other eight cups awarded cash amounts of $250, $500, or $1,000. * \\"Go for a Spin\\" ‚Äì A wheel divided into 16 sections was used, with a car symbol in one section, Zonks in five others, and cash amounts from $100 to $5,000 in the remaining ten. The contestant was shown three small prizes and had to choose the correct price for each from two options. Each correct choice allowed the contestant to replace one Zonk with a car symbol. The contestant could then either accept $500 per correct choice and end the game, or spin the wheel once and win the prize on which it stopped: cash, a car, or nothing for a Zonk. * \\"Gold Rush\\" ‚Äì The contestant was shown seven numbered boxes, five of which corresponded to digits in the price of a car (indicated by a mine cart full of gold). The other two held bundles of dynamite. The contestant had to select all five correct digits in any order to win the car. The contestant won $500 for the first correct digit chosen, and each subsequent correct digit doubled the money to a maximum of $4,000. After finding the first bundle of dynamite, the contestant could choose to stop after any correct digit and take the money. Finding the second bundle of dynamite ended the game and forfeited the money. * \\"Accelerator\\" ‚Äì A large roulette-style wheel divided into 12 sections was used, with four sections apiece marked \\"C,\\" \\"A,\\" and \\"R\\"; each letter hid a cash amount. The contestant was given two free spins and could win up to three more by ordering four grocery items from lowest to highest price. For each correctly ordered item beyond the first, one more spin was given. After the wheel was set in motion, the contestant rolled a ball down a chute so that it bounced around the wheel and eventually settled into one of the 12 sections. Once the ball settled, the contestant received the cash amount for that space and all instances of that letter were removed to reveal Zonk symbols. After each spin, the contestant could either continue playing or stop and take the accumulated cash. Hitting a Zonk forfeited the money, but the contestant could continue the game if he/she had any spins left. The contestant won a car by hitting all three letters. * \\"Smash for Cash\\" ‚Äì The contestant was shown six grocery items, each of which had a piggy bank associated with it. Five of the items were below a specified target price, and their banks each contained a different number of $1 bills from 1 to 5. The contestant chose an item, whose bank was smashed with a hammer to reveal its contents, and won cash for accumulating different amounts of money ($1,000 for $3; $2,000 for $5; $3,000 for $8; $5,000 for $11; $20,000 for $15). The item which was over the target price had a Zonk symbol in its bank; if the contestant chose this item, the game ended and he/she forfeited all winnings. After choosing any item below the target price, the contestant could choose to stop and keep his/her winnings to that point. The following games were exported to Let's Make a Deal, with the prize/item pricing element removed: *\\"Cliff Hangers\\" ‚Äì The contestant was presented with three sets of three envelopes and chose one from each set. The mountain climber advanced by the number of steps in the chosen envelope. After three turns, the contestant won a car if the climber had moved a total of 22‚Äì25 steps, or a medium prize if he had moved 16‚Äì21 steps. If the climber fell off the mountain or did not move at least 16 steps, the contestant won nothing. After the second turn, the contestant could either accept a cash offer and quit, or take the third turn. *\\"Hole in One (or Two)\\" ‚Äì Played for a car, a medium prize, and $500 cash. The contestant tried to sink a putt from each of three distances (closest for $500, intermediate for the medium prize, farthest for the car), and was allowed one miss during the game. After sinking either of the first two putts, the contestant could either end the game and keep that prize, or trade it away for a chance to win the next one. Drew Carey made a guest appearance to attempt the \\"inspiration putt.\\" *\\"Master Key\\" ‚Äì Two contestants each selected one key and were separately offered $500 not to test them in the three locks. Any prizes won by the first contestant were removed from play for the second. *\\"Five Price Tags\\" ‚Äì The contestant watched a clip from a previous playing of the game, then had one chance to choose the price of the car from five similar options. Selecting the correct price awarded $20,000 in cash. Before the price was revealed, the contestant was offered a prize package to quit the game. *\\"Punch-a-Bunch\\" ‚Äì Three contestants were chosen, one at a time, to punch out different numbers of holes (one, two, or three, in that order). Before a contestant's punched amount was revealed, he/she had to decide whether to take the total of those amounts or trade the money for a mystery prize. *\\"3 Strikes\\" ‚Äì Played as normal, except that numbers were immediately placed on the board as they were drawn. The contestant was given $2,000 at the outset; if a strike was drawn, he/she could either give back half the remaining money and remove it from the bag, or keep the money and leave the strike in play. Regardless of the outcome, the contestant kept any remaining money. *\\"Dice Game\\" ‚Äì Played as normal, but the contestant was offered cash to quit the game before each number in the price of the car was revealed. *\\"Plinko\\" ‚Äì The contestant was given two chips at the outset, then chose one of three envelopes (held by Wayne, Tiffany, and Jonathan) that held different numbers of chips from one to three. He/she then played one chip at a time on a replica Plinko board, with a potential maximum of $10,000 per chip, and would be offered either cash or a mystery prize to forfeit all winnings and quit the game. First played on Let's Make a Deal on April Fools' Day in 2015. *\\"The Big Wheel\\" ‚Äì Three contestants each took one spin on a replica Big Wheel, then selected one of three envelopes on three rows concealing a dollar amount that would be multiplied by the value they had spun (e.g., a spin of 55 cents multiplied by $100 would award $5,500). Before the multiplier was revealed, the contestant was given the chance to trade the money for a mystery prize. For the 2020 edition of Mash-Up Week, Dice Game, 3 Strikes, the Big Wheel, Plinko and Cliff Hangers were played. Additionally, Drew Carey appeared on the episode in which Plinko was played and substituted for Jonathan.

It is situated both east from Bourne and west from Spalding, and at a bend in the River Glen. History The word 'gowt' refers to a sluice or outflow, \\\\- gives the word as the local pronunciation of 'Go Out' \\\\- defines gowt as 'A water-pipe under the ground. A sewer. A flood-gate, through which the marsh-water runs from the reens into the sea.' (reen is a Somerset word, but unknown in the fens) though the origin of the word is not known with complete certainty. It appears to be cognate with the French √©gout, sewer. Though the modern mind associates the word 'sewer' with foul water, it was not always necessarily so.Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, 1972 reprint: 'sewer'. There are several 'gowt' placenames on the fens, including Anton's Gowt. In a reference\\"Paterson‚Äôs Roads, Eighteenth Edition, 1826\\", The Bourne Archive Gallery. Retrieved 15 August 2011 that predates the pumping works, the nearby turnpike toll gate was known as Guthram Cote. A collection of stripmap itineraries This is indicative, as though the spelling and form of the name vary considerably, there appears to be no reference to the use of 'gowt' in connection with Guthram's Cote before the steam engine was installed. The earlier name was still in use contemporary with the use of the engine. In 1189, when Richard I disafforested Spalding and Pinchbeck, Guthrams Gowt was known as Gudramsende, and the precursor of the adjacent Forty Foot Drain was the Midfendic. Pumping station A wind-driven scoopwheel pump was operating here as early as 1766. In the 19th and early 20th century a steam- powered drainage engine was in existence, set up following the Acts of Parliament of 1841 and 1843. The 1841 act of parliament authorized the building of an engine to drain Bourne North Fen, replacing engines (probably windmills), erected after an act of 1776, which were described as \\"dilapidated, decayed and entirely removed\\". The act of 1843 transferred all responsibility for this engine and the drainage from the Black sluice commissioners to the Bourne North Fen Commissioners, a separation of responsibilities that continued until after the Second World War. The book goes on to describe how proposals for a replacement engine were made in 1881, but were not taken up before Wheeler went to press. However, in 1895 the scoopwheel was replaced: with a centrifugal pump made by Easton & Anderson. Then in 1918 the steam engine was replaced by a horizontal gas engine, which drove the Easton and Anderson pump via belt. In 1933 a two-cylinder Ruston diesel and a Gwynnes pump were added. There are now no pumping facilities on site, only a rainfall telemetry station for the Environment Agency.Geograph locational photos of Guthram Gowt, including the modern rainfall station Geography Guthram Gowt falls within the drainage area of the Black Sluice Internal Drainage Board. It is at the southern, upstream end of the South Forty-Foot Drain, and the location chosen for a new lock to allow traffic into the River Glen as part of the Fens Waterways Link project. A few buildings in agricultural use are located at the site, and on the opposite side of the road is Glen farm, and on the opposite side of the River Glen, Willow Tree Farm. Guthram Gowt is served by Delaine Buses 302 service to Spalding, and the Lincolnshire CallConnect minibus service.

The first, created by Sals Bostwick, debuted on May 21, 1928. He drew it until his death in 1930, after which it was continued by cartoonists Brandon Walsh, Benbee, Darrell McClure, Dow Walling and Herman Thomas before coming to an end in 1932.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/b/bostwick_sals.htm In 1936, cartoonist Gene Ahern created the second strip, a continuation of a previous strip, Our Boarding House, which he drew from 1921 to 1936 for another syndicate. This second Room and Board was discontinued on November 29, 1958. Ahern's Room and Board had no connection with Bostwick's strip other than the similar title.Room and Board at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on October 22, 2016.  Revival history  Ahern was making an annual $35,000 doing Our Boarding House for Newspaper Enterprise Association when King Features Syndicate offered to double that figure. Leaving NEA in March 1936 for King Features, Ahern created a copycat strip, using the title of the previous King Features strip, Bostwick's Room and Board. The new Room and Board had more than a few parallels with Our Boarding House, including a larger-than-life blowhard as the central character. Characters and story A resident in the second Room and Boards boarding house was Judge Puffle, very similar to Major Hoople, the central character of Ahern's Our Boarding House. The mustache was slightly different, the nose was slightly smaller, and instead of a fez like that worn by Hoople, Puffle had a beret.\\"Hoople v. Puffle, Time, May 11, 1936. Some strips featured a large roomer, that the landlord had rented a room to and asked various persons to evict.For example, Comics historian Don Markstein traced the proliferation of Puffle and other Hoople variations: :Knock-offs, such as Associated Press' Mister Gilfeather (which, by the way, was handled at various times by both Al Capp and Milton Caniff, before they hit it big with Li'l Abner and Terry and the Pirates, respectively), began to proliferate. In fact, it was a knock-off that took Ahern away from his creation. King Features launched one called Room and Board, starring the very Hoople-like Judge Puffle, in 1936, and hired Ahern himself to write and draw it. This was a reprise of a move King had made nine years earlier, hiring George Swanson (Elza Poppin) to produce a duplicate of his own NEA strip, Salesman Sam, and it had a similar result ‚Äî success, but not to the extent of the original. When, in 1953, Ahern retired, Room and Board ended. Today, its memory is overshadowed by its own topper, The Squirrel Cage, where the enigmatically familiar phrase, \\"Nov shmoz ka pop?\\" was introduced.Our Boarding House at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on October 22, 2016. The strip also adopted Our Boarding House's format of a single panel daily with a multi-panel Sunday page. Gene Ahern's Room and Board (June 19, 1938) The Squirrel Cage Ahern's topper strip, The Squirrel Cage, which ran above Room and Board from June 21, 1936 until at least 1947, is notable because of the repetitive use of the nonsensical question, '\\"Nov shmoz ka pop?\\", which was never translated yet became a national catch phrase. As a consequence, The Squirrel Cage and Our Boarding House are today both better remembered than Room and Board, despite its 17-year run. Reprints There were several reprints in Dell Comics anthologies before the strip came to an end with Ahern's 1953 retirement.

In addition to its characteristic copper pickelhaube domes, the building was graced by a -tall, three-ton bronze statue of Germania on a pediment over the door. In 1918, the building's name was changed to the Brumder Building in response to anti-German sentiment during World War I, and the statue was removed discreetly in the night. Efforts to trace the fate of the statue, which was stored for a while by sculptor Cyril Colnik, have proven futile, with one theory claiming that it was melted down for scrap during World War II, and another speculating that it may have gone to the Smithsonian Institution, and possibly still be there.Joslyn, Jay. \\"Where is the bronze giantess, Germania?\\" Milwaukee Sentinel, April 17, 1981; part 3, p. 1. Germania Building Plaque Seventeen years after Brumder's death in 1910, the printing presses were removed from the basement levels of the building, giving the city its first underground parking garage. The name was changed back to the Germania Building after a significant renovation in 1981. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in July 1983. In 1968 the Brumder Building was the scene of a significant protest against the war in Vietnam. Nine Milwaukee draft boards maintained their offices on the second floor. On the evening of September 24 fourteen activists entered and removed about 10,000 files. Those files were then carried outside across Wells Street, to the area now known as Postman Square, and burned. In early 2007, the building was sold to a Milwaukee-based investor group led by Santino \\"Sonny\\" Bando, for slightly more than $4 million (approx. $44/sq. ft.) from a suburban-Chicago- based investment trust. The building had suffered a decline in tenants and a foreclosure sale in 1990 but was, at the time of the sale, 95% occupied, according to Bando. One of the reasons Bando cited for buying the building was the fact that he and his investors also own another of downtown Milwaukee's historic office buildings, the Iron Block Building (205 E. Wisconsin Ave.), which they bought in 2004. Bando said he likes those types of buildings \\"because you can't really build them anymore.\\"Daykin, Tom. \\"Germania Building is sold for $4 million: Investors also own Iron Block Building\\" Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, January 9, 2007, p.

The PSS usually comprises an airline reservations system, an airline inventory system and a departure control system (DCS).  Modules  Generally the PSS is made up of modules that are used to manage different parts of the airline‚Äôs business. The airline reservations system is the system that allows an airline to sell their inventory (seats). It contains information on schedules and fares and contains a database of reservations (or passenger name records) and of tickets issued (if applicable). The airline inventory system may or may not be integrated with the reservation system. The system contains all the airline‚Äôs flights and the available seats. The main function of the inventory system is to define how many seats are available on a particular flight by opening or closing an individual booking class in accordance with rules defined by the airline. The departure control system (DCS) is the system used by airlines and airports to check-in a passenger. The DCS is connected to the reservation system enabling it to check who has a valid reservation on a flight. The DCS is used to enter information required by customs or border security agencies and to issue the boarding document.

Origins The family originated from Hugh I (died after 1098), seigneur of Canville-les-Deux-√âglises in Normandy, whose elder son Hugh II inherited the ancestral lands in the Pays de Caux while the younger son Richard I Canville went to England around 1135. It is possible that Hugh II, who remained in Normandy, was the father of Hugh III (died about 1194) who married Christina, daughter of William le Moine, and held lands at Godington in Oxfordshire, Shenfield and Fobbing in Essex, Westerham in Kent and unspecified places in Buckinghamshire and Huntingdonshire. Their son was Thomas. Career Probably born before 1175, he served under King Richard I in Normandy in 1194. By April 1206 he had been knighted and was one of the panel of knights holding land in Kent who were eligible to sit in the Grand Assize. In or before 1208, he gave land at Fobbing to the nuns of Barking Abbey. Though he normally met calls for military service by payment in cash, in 1210 he went in person with King John to Ireland. By the end of 1215, when he joined the rebel barons in the First Barons' War, the king ordered the confiscation of his land at Godington. Once the civil war ended, he made his peace with the new government of King Henry III and by the end of 1217 had regained his lands. A false report of his death in 1220 led to his under-age heir and lands being put under the care of Philip Oldcotes. Holy Trinity church, Godington After the death of his mother, he had given Godington church to the nuns of Elstow Abbey, but by 1221 tried to reclaim it. A lawsuit next year resulted in him confirming his grant, in return for which the nuns promised to pray for him and his heirs. In 1227 he secured the right to hold a weekly market at Westerham and both a weekly market and a yearly fair at Fobbing. In that year he was named a justice in eyre for Essex, Kent and Hertfordshire, serving under Martin Pattishall. Promotion followed in 1228 when he acted as a justice of the Common Bench, though he does not seem to have sat after 1229. The next year he did not serve on the English expedition to Brittany, but in 1232 was one of those responsible for collecting tax in Kent. Still alive in July 1234, he was dead by 22 January 1235. Family With his wife Agnes, who after his death married the Essex landowner William Marney, he had sons called Robert and John, who were born after 1214. Thomas may have had an earlier marriage without surviving children. After his death, the wardship of the heir Robert together with the right to hold his inherited lands and choose his bride, was sold to Hamo de Crevecoeur for the considerable sum of ¬£400. Sir Robert married Joan, probably a daughter of Hamo's, and they had a son Roger who died after 1285. Joan survived him.

One-time personal physician to Ali Pasha, the 19th-century Albanian ruler of the Pashalik of Yanina, Meksi produced the first translation of the New Testament into Albanian with the help and sponsorship of the British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS). Meksi did not live to see his work's publication however, which was supervised by Gregory IV of Athens. As a member of Filiki Etaireia, a secret society whose purpose was to establish an independent Greek state, Meksi joined the Greeks in the Siege of Tripolitsa during their war of independence against the Ottoman Empire and died shortly afterwards. As well as its value to Albanian Christians, who could for the first time read the Gospels in their own language, Meksi's work advanced the study of written Albanian, and in particular informed the work of 19th-century linguists and philologists such as Joseph Ritter von Xylander, August Schleicher, and Johann Georg von Hahn. Their studies of the Albanian language were significantly influenced by Meksi's Bible translation. Early life Meksi was born in 1770 in Labov√´, a village near Gjirokast√´r, and pursued secondary studies in Ioannina, then an important Ottoman provincial center (now in Greece).Lloshi, p. 112 His first employment was as a folk physician to the court of Ali Pasha, the Albanian ruler of the Pashalik of Yanina, a position he held until 1803. Armed with a letter of recommendation from Ali Pasha, Meksi was admitted to the University of Naples in Italy, where he studied medicine under Dr. Nicola Acuto and practiced in a hospital administered by the parish of San Giovanni a Carbonara. After completing his studies in 1808, Meksi returned to Yanina and once again served in Ali Pasha's court, this time as one of his four physicians. His colleagues were Dr. Metaxa, (degree in medicine from the University of Paris), Dr. Saqeralliu (degree in medicine from the University of Vienna), and Dr. Loukas Vagias, (brother of Thanasis Vagias, with a degree in medicine from Leipzig University).Lloshi p. 113 Philological activity After falling out of favor with Ali Pasha, for reasons unknown, Meksi left the court in 1810 to travel around Europe. During a brief stay in Venice he began to develop an interest in the Albanian alphabet and grammar. He published two translations into Albanian during 1814, both now lost, one of which was a religious work by Abb√© Claude Fleury (1640‚Äì1723).Kastrati, p. 516 Meksi also wrote a grammar of the Albanian language in Albanian.Lloshi, p. 117 It too has been lost, but it is mentioned in many letters reporting Meksi's work as an Albanian philologist written by Robert Pinkerton to his superiors at the British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS), which subsequently sponsored the translation of the New Testament into Albanian. The work must have been written before 1819 and may be either the first Albanian grammar or the second, after that of Jani Evstrat Vithkuqari; it is not known which was published first. In this period Meksi also created a new Albanian alphabet, rationalizing and consolidating the many different pre-existing alphabets,Meksi (2000), p. 46 employing a mix of Greek and Latin characters. Using his new alphabet, he wrote a book called Orthography of the Albanian language, (). Translation of the New Testament Pinkerton, who in 1816 was the BFBS's representative in Moscow, had met that year with a community of Albanians in Vienna, then capital of the Austrian Empire. They assured him that a translation of the New Testament into Albanian was indeed possible.Clayers, p. 181 In a letter to his superiors at the BFBS, dated August 28, 1816, Pinkerton wrote that the Albanian nation occupied a large part of the ancient Illyria, that they spoke a language completely different from Slavic, Turkish, Greek, or Latin, and that for the Albanian Orthodox the mass was recited in Greek, a language that believers and even some of the priests did not understand. According to Pinkerton, the translation could be done by one or more Albanians from the Ionian islands under the supervision of an Albanian bishop. In 1819, apparently with the blessing of his superiors at the BFBS, Pinkerton met with Meksi (referring him as Evangelos Mexicos)Rev. Dr. Pinkerton's Letters, in the \\"Annual Report of the American Bible Society\\", pp. 181, 184. in Istanbul.Clayers, p. 182 Meksi, who was then a teacher in Serres, had been recommended to Pinkerton because of his Albanian grammar book. Pinkerton also relates in one of his letters to the BFBS that Meksi was well regarded by the Albanian community, the Greek Orthodox Church, and by Patriarch Gregory V of Constantinople. Gregory, according to Pinkerton, also offered to find two suitable clergymen to assist Meksi in his endeavor. Lastly, Pinkerton recommended that the Greek alphabet be used as the most suitable for the Albanian language. On October 19, 1819, Pinkerton and Meksi concluded a contract to translate the New Testament into Albanian on behalf of the society. It was agreed that the Bible would have to be translated into the Albanian dialect of Yanina. Meksi completed the work in two years, ten months earlier than the contract's deadline.Lloshi pp. 112‚Äì113 Early in 1821 Mr. Leeves of the BFBS visited Thessaloniki to supervise the translation. On February 8, 1821 he wrote that the work had been completed, and that the only outstanding task was a final review by a competent person, who had already been assigned to the task.Lloshi p. 118 In 1822 the revised manuscript was sent to Malta to be printed, and in 1823 Leeves sent from Malta to the representative of the society in Corfu the first copy of a printed New Testament in Albanian. Meanwhile, the New Testament had had a final revision performed by the Archimandrite of Euboea, Grigor Gjirokastriti, an Albanian who subsequently became Archbishop Gregory IV of Athens. Archimandrite Grigor had recommended that the Bible be printed in a large typeface in two columns, one in Albanian and the other in modern Greek, because Albanians would rather read modern Greek than Koine.Lloshi p. 119 On March 16, 1824 Mr. Lowndes, the BFBS's secretary in Corfu, sent a letter to the society in which he mentioned that the sum paid to Meksi for his work was 6,000 piastras and that Archimandrite Grigor was paid 60 crowns. On September 5, 1824 the Saint Matthew's Gospel was published in Albanian. According to Lowndes' letters, the Albanian community of Missolonghi was extremely excited when mass was said with a piece from Saint Matthew, as since its translation they had been impatient to hear it in Albanian.Lloshi, p. 128 In July 1827 the form in which the first 500 copies of the New Testament were to be bound was decided in London.Lloshi, p. 132 The entire edition amounted to 2,000 copies.Lloshi, p. 142 Although Gjirokastriti's edition of the New Testament was written in Albanian, it used the Greek alphabet.Lloshi, p. 23 It is not known which alphabet Meksi used in his own manuscript. The Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople was not against the work of Meksi or the Bible Society at that time. On the contrary, for the translation the British missionaries successfully appealed to Gregory V and enlisted the help of an Orthodox bishop, Gjirokastriti, for the final edition of the New Testament in Albanian. Greek War of Independence Meksi was a member of the Filiki Etaireia,Clayers, p. 182 a secret society whose purpose was to overthrow Ottoman rule over the Balkans and to establish an independent Greek state. When the Greek War of Independence broke out in 1821, after his translation had been completed, Meksi joined the Greeks in the Siege of Tripolitsa. Despite suffering from a serious bout of pneumonia, he continued to work as a physician during the war. He is also said to have taken part in the negotiations leading to an agreement proposed by Theodoros Kolokotronis that permitted the Albanians who were defending Tripolitsa to leave unharmed,Meksi (2000), p. 56 an arrangement that helped the Greeks to capture the town from the Turks. Legacy Meksi did not live to see the 1827 publication of his translation of the New Testament; he had died a bachelor six years earlier, at the age of about 51. The first publication of a Bible translation from Greek to a modern Balkanic language, it ran to 2,000 copies, a huge number for the time. It preceded the modern Bulgarian version by two years and the Romanian translation by twenty.Kastrati p. 519 A second edition was published in 1858 in Athens,Clayers 183 but as it had not been revised by any native speakers of Albanian it was full of errors. Meksi's work was important for the development of written Albanian, and his endeavors strengthened the conviction that a stable Albanian alphabet had to be created. His translation served as the basis for Joseph Ritter von Xylander's studies of the Albanian language, which definitively refuted the thesis that the language had a Tatar origin. Von Xylander concluded that Albanian had an Indo-European root. Two other international scholars also studied the Albanian language mainly based on Meksi's translation of the New Testament: August Schleicher, who stated that his knowledge of the conjugation of Albanian verbs was based on Meksi's work,Lloshi, pp. 143-144 and Johann Georg von Hahn an Austrian diplomat, philologist, and specialist in Albanian history, language, and culture, who translated the Bible into Gheg Albanian with the help of Kostandin Kristoforidhi.Lloshi, p. 144 References Sources  Further reading * * Category:1770 births Category:1821 deaths Category:18th-century Albanian writers Category:19th-century Albanian writers Category:People from Gjirokast√´r Category:Albanian physicians Category:People of the Greek War of Independence Category:Albanian translators Category:Translators of the Bible into Albanian Category:18th-century translators Category:19th-century translators Category:Albanian male writers Category:Albanian-language writers ","title":"Vangjel Meksi"},{"id":"25047517","text":"Fousseyni Ciss√© (born 17 July 1989) is a French professional football player of Senegalese and Chadian descent.

It was once thought lost and was rediscovered in 2008.Forest of Bowland official website It disappeared in 1885 when the estates of the Towneleys, one of Lancashire's great aristocratic families, were broken up following the death of the last male heir. For much of the twentieth century, experts thought that the Lordship belonged to the Crown. In 1938, the Duchy of Lancaster had acquired some of the Forest of Bowland, now known as the Whitewell Estate, near Clitheroe, and it was believed that the Lordship had been acquired with it. It was discovered in 2008 that the 1938 sale, while it included mineral, sporting and forestry rights, specifically excluded the Lordship of Bowland itself. It accordingly descended to a Towneley family trust. In 2008, Charles Towneley Strachey, 4th Baron O'Hagan auctioned the title. The new Lord of Bowland was later revealed to be a Cambridge University don who specialises in the history of Lancashire, its place names and dialects and has ancestral links to the Forest.  History  The Bowland Fells in NE Lancashire While a lineage for the barony can be traced back speculatively through the Earls of Northumbria to Oswiu and his marriage alliance in 638 AD with the Urien kings of Rheged,David Rollason, Northumbria, 500-1100: Creation and Destruction of a Kingdom (Cambridge University Press 2008)JEA Joliffe, \\"Northumbrian Institutions\\", English Historical Review, 41 (1926), 1-42 the roots of the modern lordship are Norman. Although Roger de Poitou is recorded as tenant-in-chief of the manors of Bowland in Domesday, what we now understand as the Forest and Liberty of Bowland was created by William Rufus sometime after 1087. It formed part of a larger parcel of lands granted to his vassal, either to reward Roger for his role in the defeat of Dolfin of Carlisle and the army of Scots king Malcolm III in 1091-2 or as a result of the confiscation of lands from Robert de Mowbray, Earl of Northumbria in 1095. These lands came to form the Barony, later the Honor of Lancaster in the closing decade of the eleventh century. By the late twelfth century, the disparate holdings within the Honor of Lancaster had cohered to form what became Lancashire, first explicitly recognised as a county in 1194. In turn, the Forest and Liberty of Bowland, along with the grant of the adjacent fee of Blackburnshire and holdings in Hornby and Amounderness, came to form the basis of what became known as the Honor of Clitheroe. Ownership of the forest followed the same descent as the Honor, ultimately passing back with the rest of the de Lacy landsClitheroe Historic Town Assessment Report Lancashire County Council William Farrer, The court rolls of the honor of Clitheroe in the county of Lancaster (1897) to the Earldom of Lancaster. After 1351, it was administered as part of the Duchy of Lancaster; from 1399, as a possession of the Crown. It ceased to be a part of the Duchy in 1835. Territorially, the Lordship of Bowland covered an area of almost on the historic borders of Lancashire and Yorkshire. It comprised a Royal Forest and a Liberty of ten manors spanning eight townships and four parishes. The manors within the Liberty were Slaidburn (Newton-in-Bowland, West Bradford, Grindleton), Knowlmere, Waddington, Easington, Bashall, Mitton, Withgill (Crook), Leagram, Hammerton and Dunnow (Battersby). Harrop was included within the Forest.

The film stars Alec Guinness and Jack Hawkins. Plot In an unnamed East European country where communist tyranny has recently replaced Nazi tyranny, a Cardinal (Alec Guinness) is falsely accused of treason. The Cardinal had withstood torture when he opposed the Nazis, so the regime knows it will not be able to use force to get him to make a false confession. The Interrogator (Jack Hawkins), an old associate of the Cardinal's but now a Communist, is given the task of persuading him to make a public confession. He intends to do it by undermining the Cardinal's certainty in the righteousness of his resistance to the state. At first the Interrogator makes no progress. This leads the state authorities to grow impatient and try to trick the Cardinal with fake evidence. The Cardinal is easily able to deal with these clumsy attempts, which leave the state prosecutors humiliated. The Interrogator uses sleep deprivation, relentless questioning, and the deliberate upsetting of the Cardinal‚Äôs eating and sleep/wake patterns to weaken him. He eventually breaks the Cardinal's will by showing him he became a priest out of selfishness and vanity and to escape his childhood poverty, not out of goodness, virtue or benevolence, which everyone (including the Cardinal himself) has always believed. To purge his sin, in the show trial that follows the Cardinal confesses to every lie of which he is accused, and is released to face a silent, bewildered crowd. There is a subplot about a young warder (Ronald Lewis) who is in love with a married woman (Jeannette Sterke), who wants to leave the country and join her husband. Cast * Alec Guinness as The Cardinal * Jack Hawkins as The Interrogator * Wilfrid Lawson as The Jailer * Kenneth Griffith as The Secretary * Jeanette Sterke as The Girl * Ronald Lewis as The Guard * Raymond Huntley as The General * Mark Dignam as The Governor * Gerard Heinz as The Doctor Production The Cardinal was based on Croatian cardinal Aloysius Stepinac (1898‚Äì1960), who was a defendant in a show trial in Croatia (as a result of the similarities, the film couldn't be shown in Yugoslavia until the fall of the communist government)http://www.jutarnji.hr/kardinal-stepinac-u-ocima-hollywooda/414207/ and on Hungarian cardinal J√≥zsef Mindszenty (1892‚Äì1975), who was charged in Hungary. The film was shot in England and Belgium (at Ostend and Bruges). Reception The film was controversial. It was seen as \\"pro-Communist\\" by some in Ireland; while in France, where the film was prohibited from being shown at Cannes, the film was labelled \\"anti-Communist.\\" Likewise it was banned from the Venice Film Festival due to its being considered \\"so anti- Communist that it would be offensive to Communist countries\\". Some in Italy saw it as \\"anti-Catholic\\", but despite this the film was given an award by the International Catholic Office of the Cinema, and commended by Cardinal Griffin.\\"The Prisoner\\" Wins Catholic Film Award, Catholic Standard, July 20, 1956 The Radio Times, while praising the two main performances, wrote, \\"Peter Glenville's theatrical direction won't do much to persuade those without religious or political convictions to become involved\\". TV Guide wrote, \\"basically a photographed stage play, and although there are a few other actors, Hawkins and Guinness are center stage most of the time--their mano a mano a delight to watch. Director Glenville had to use all of his expertise to keep the film from being little more than talking heads, but his touch is sure\\". The New York Times called The Prisoner a \\"grim and gripping drama‚Äîwhich also happens to be an equally revealing motion picture, one of the best of the year...a film that will make you shiver‚Äîand think.\\"  References  External links * Category:1955 films Category:1955 drama films Category:British drama films Category:Films directed by Peter Glenville Category:Films scored by Benjamin Frankel Category:Films shot at Pinewood Studios Category:British films Category:Films critical of communism Category:Columbia Pictures films Category:1955 directorial debut films ","title":"The Prisoner (1955 film)"},{"id":"25047592","text":"Three ships of the Royal Navy have borne the name HMS Laertes, after either Laertes, a figure in Greek mythology, or Laertes, a character in Shakespeare's Hamlet: * was a destroyer launched as HMS Sarpedon in 1913, but renamed shortly afterwards.

Like his namesake, Shakespeare is a talented, if somewhat profane, writer. He sees himself as ranking very low in the social ladder of high school. Shakespeare appears as a minor character in Wizner's second novel, Castration Celebration. *Neil Wasserman ‚Äî Shakespeare‚Äôs best friend who is obsessed with his own bowel movements. He and Katie hook up during the book, much to Shakespeare's annoyance. *Katie Marks ‚Äî Shakespeare‚Äôs only other friend, who is verbally abusive to both him and Neil and wears a military coat. She has a drinking problem but cleans up by the novel's conclusion. *Gandhi Shapiro ‚Äî Shakespeare‚Äôs younger, handsomer brother who is as successful with girls as Shakespeare is a failure. Is also a sharp businessman and extremely popular. He is revealed partway in the book to have been using marijuana since his freshman year. *Celeste Keller ‚Äî an intelligent classmate who briefly dates Shakespeare because of his witty writing in an attempt to forget about her boyfriend who is away at college. She attempts to remain friends with him, but he generally avoids her after their relationship ends. *Charlotte White ‚Äî a frequently absent classmate who is dealing with a variety of family issues. Shakespeare befriends her and finds himself unexpectedly attracted to her, ultimately asking her to the prom near the end of the book. Critical reaction Kirkus found it funny, but the jokes sometimes slowed down the plot. Publishers Weekly called it \\"bold and bawdy\\", \\"exceptionally funny and smart\\". Michael Sullivan praised it for \\"great laughs\\". It was also reviewed by Booklist.

Habsburg and W√ºrttemberg regulars numbering 40,000, under the command of Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour, besieged and captured the French-controlled fortifications at the village of Kehl in the German state of Baden-Durlach. The fortifications at Kehl represented important bridgehead crossing the Rhine to Strasbourg, an Alsatian city, a French Revolutionary stronghold. This battle was part of the Rhine Campaign of 1796, in the French Revolutionary War of the First Coalition. In the 1790s, the Rhine was wild, unpredictable, and difficult to cross, in some places more than four or more times wider than it is in the twenty-first century, even under non-flood conditions. Its channels and tributaries wound through marsh and meadow and created islands of trees and vegetation that were alternately submerged by floods or exposed during the dry seasons. At Kehl and the city of Strasbourg lay a complex of bridges, gates, fortifications and barrage dams. These had been constructed by the fortress architect S√©bastien le Prestre de Vauban in the seventeenth century. The crossings had been contested before: in 1678 during the French-Dutch war, in 1703 during the War of the Spanish Succession, in 1733 during the War of the Polish Succession, and earlier in 1796, when the French crossed into the German states on 23-24 June. Critical to French success was the army's ability to cross the Rhine at will. The crossings at H√ºningen, near the Swiss city of Basel, and the crossing at Kehl, gave them ready access to most of southwestern Germany; from there, French armies could sweep north, south, or east, depending on their military goal. Throughout the summer of 1796, the French and the Austrians had chased each other back and forth across the south German states. By October, the Habsburg force, under the command of Archduke Charles, had pushed the French back to the Rhine. With the conclusion of the Battle of Schliengen on 24 October, the French army withdrew south and west toward the Rhine. The French commander, Jean Victor Marie Moreau, offered an armistice that the Archduke was inclined to accept. The Archduke wanted to secure the Rhine crossings so he could send troops to northern Italy to relieve Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser at besieged Mantua; an armistice with Moreau would allow him to do that. However, his brother, Francis II, the Holy Roman Emperor, and the civilian military advisers of the Aulic Council categorically refused such an armistice, forcing Charles to order simultaneous sieges at H√ºningen and Kehl. These tied his army to the Rhine for most of the winter.Phillip Cuccia, Napoleon in Italy: the Sieges of Mantua, 1796‚Äì1799, University of Oklahoma Press, 2014, pp. 87‚Äì93. Smith. Data Book. pp. 125, 131‚Äì133. On 18 September 1796, the Austrians temporarily acquired control of the t√™tes-de-ponts (bridgeheads) joining Kehl and Strasbourg until a strong French counter-attack forced them to retreat. The situation remained in status quo until late October. Immediately after the Battle of Schliengen, while most of Moreau's army retreated south to cross the Rhine at H√ºningen, Count Baillet Latour moved north to Kehl to begin the siege. On 22 November, the French defenders at Kehl, under Louis Desaix and the overall commander of the French Army of the Rhine and Moselle, Jean-Victor-Marie Moreau, almost ended the siege when they executed a sortie that nearly captured the Austrian artillery park. In early December, though, the Austrians expanded the siege, connecting a grand parallel with a series of batteries in a semi-circle around the village and the bridges. By late December, the completed Austrian batteries connected with the captured French fortification called Bonnet de Pr√™tre; from these positions, the Austrians bombarded the French defenses with enfilade fire. After the defenses were thoroughly riddled by heavy bombardment from the besiegers, the French defenders capitulated and withdrew on 9 January 1797.  Background  Initially, the rulers of Europe viewed the 1789 revolution in France as an event between the French king and his subjects, and not something in which they should interfere. In 1790, Leopold succeeded his brother Joseph as emperor of the Holy Roman Empire and by 1791, the danger surrounding his sister, Marie Antoinette, and her children, alarmed him. In August 1791, in consultation with French √©migr√© nobles and Frederick William II of Prussia, he issued the Declaration of Pillnitz declaring the interest of the monarchs of Europe as one with the interests of Louis and his family. He and his fellow monarchs threatened ambiguous, but serious, consequences if anything should happen to the royal family. The French √©migr√©s continued to agitate for support of a counter-revolution abroad. On 20 April 1792, the French National Convention declared war on Austria. In this War of the First Coalition (1792‚Äì98), France ranged itself against most of the European states sharing land or water borders with her, plus Portugal and the Ottoman Empire. Although initially successful in campaigns in 1792 and 1793, the French army lost some effectiveness during the Reign of Terror, as its generals were intimidated and/or executed, and more and more of the officers left France for safer havens.Timothy Blanning. The French Revolutionary Wars. New York: Oxford University Press, 1996, , pp. 41‚Äì59. At the end of the Rhine Campaign of 1795, the two sides called a truce.Theodore Ayrault Dodge, Warfare in the Age of Napoleon: The Revolutionary Wars Against the First Coalition in Northern Europe and the Italian Campaign, 1789‚Äì1797.

This agreement lasted until 20 May 1796, when the Austrians announced that it would end on 31 May.Ramsay Weston Phipps,The Armies of the First French Republic: Volume II The Arm√©es du Moselle, du Rhin, de Sambre-et-Meuse, de Rhin-et-Moselle Pickle Partners Publishing, 2011 reprint (original publication 1923-1933), p. 278. The Coalition's Army of the Lower Rhine counted 90,000 troops. The 20,000-man right wing under Duke Ferdinand Frederick Augustus of W√ºrttemberg, who was replaced by Wilhelm von Wartensleben, stood on the east bank of the Rhine behind the Sieg River, observing the French bridgehead at D√ºsseldorf. The garrisons of Mainz and Ehrenbreitstein counted 10,000 more. The remainder of the Imperial and Coalition army was posted on the west bank behind the Nahe. Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser led the 80,000-strong Army of the Upper Rhine. Its right wing occupied Kaiserslautern on the west bank while the left wing under Anton Szt√°ray, Michael von Fr√∂hlich guarded the Rhine from Mannheim to Switzerland; Louis Joseph, Prince of Cond√© and his corps of French royalists patrolled the area between Freiburg im Breisgau and Basel. The original Austrian strategy was to capture Trier and to use their position on the west bank to strike at each of the French armies in turn. However, after news arrived in Vienna of Napoleon Bonaparte's successes, Wurmser was sent to Italy with 25,000 reinforcements. Reconsidering the situation, the Aulic Council gave Archduke Charles command over both Habsburg armies and ordered him to hold his ground.  Geography and politics  The broad Rhine River and its many tributaries prevented easy escape into France. The Rhine River flows west along the border between the German states and the Swiss Cantons. The stretch between Rheinfall, by Schaffhausen and Basel, the High Rhine (Hochrhein) cuts through steep hillsides over a gravel bed; in such paces as the former rapids at Laufenburg, it moves in torrents.Laufenburg now has dams and barrages to control the flow of water. Thomas P. Knepper, The Rhine, Handbook for Environmental Chemistry Series, Part L. New York, Springer, 2006, , pp. 5‚Äì19. A few miles north and east of Basel, the terrain flattens. The Rhine makes a wide, northerly turn, in what is called the Rhine knee, and enters the so- called Rhine ditch (Rheingraben), part of a rift valley bordered by the Black Forest on the east and Vosges Mountains on the west. In 1796, the plain on both sides of the river, some wide, was dotted with villages and farms. At both far edges of the flood plain, especially on the eastern side, the old mountains created dark shadows on the horizon. Tributaries cut through the hilly terrain of the Black Forest, creating deep defiles in the mountains. The tributaries then wind in rivulets through the flood plain to the river.Knepper, pp. 19‚Äì20. The Rhine River itself looked different in the 1790s than it does in the twenty-first century; the passage from Basel to Iffezheim was \\"corrected\\" (straightened) between 1817 and 1875. Between 1927 and 1975, a canal was constructed to control the water level. In 1790, though, the river was wild and unpredictable, in some places more than four or more times wider than the twenty-first century, even under regular (non-flood) conditions. Its channels wound through marsh and meadow and created islands of trees and vegetation that were periodically submerged by floods. It was crossable at Kehl, by Strasbourg, and at H√ºningen, by Basel, where systems of viaducts and causeways made access reliable.

Political terrain  The plethora of states of the Holy Roman Empire was especially dense on the east bank of the Rhine. In particular, the states involved in late 1796 included, for example, the Breisgau (Habsburg), Offenburg and Rottweil (imperial cities), the princely states of F√ºrstenberg, Neuenburg, and Hohenzollern, the Duke of Baden, the Duchy of W√ºrttemberg, and several dozen ecclesiastic polities. Many of these territories were not contiguous: a village could belong predominantly to one polity, but have a farmstead, a house, or even one or two strips of land that belonged to another polity. The light cream-colored territories are so subdivided they cannot be named. The German-speaking states on the east bank of the Rhine were part of the vast complex of territories in central Europe called the Holy Roman Empire.Joachim Whaley, Germany and the Holy Roman Empire: Volume I: Maximilian I to the Peace of Westphalia, 1493‚Äì1648 (2012), pp. 17‚Äì20. The considerable number of territories in the Empire included more than 1,000 entities. Their size and influence varied, from the Kleinstaaten (\\"little states\\") that covered no more than a few square miles to large and powerful states. Their governance varied: they included free imperial cities, also of different sizes, such as the powerful Augsburg and the minuscule Weil der Stadt; ecclesiastical territories, also of varying sizes and influence, such as the wealthy Abbey of Reichenau and the powerful Archbishopric of Cologne; and such durable dynastic states as W√ºrttemberg. When viewed on a map, the Empire resembled a Flickenteppich (\\"patchwork carpet\\"). Some states included non-contiguous pieces: both the Habsburg domains and Hohenzollern Prussia also governed territories outside the Empire structures, such as the Habsburg territories in eastern Europe and northern Italy. There were also territories completely surrounded by France that belonged to W√ºrttemberg, the Count of Solm, the archbishopric of Trier, and Hesse-Darmstadt. Among the German-speaking states, the Holy Roman Empire's administrative and legal mechanisms provided a venue to resolve disputes between peasants and landlords, between jurisdictions, and within jurisdictions. Through the organization of Imperial Circles (called Reichskreise), groups of states consolidated resources and promoted regional and organizational interests, including economic cooperation and military protection.See, for example, James Allen Vann, The Swabian Kreis: Institutional Growth in the Holy Roman Empire 1648‚Äì1715.

German home towns: community, state, and general estate, 1648‚Äì1871, Ithaca, Cornell University Press, 1998. The fortresses at H√ºningen and Kehl were both important bridgeheads across the river. At Strasbourg, a once imperial city, and Kehl, the German village across the river from it, the first permanent bridge had been erected in 1338. In 1678, Strasbourg was taken over by France, and the bridge became part of the city's defense system. Louis XIV ordered the construction of the fortress by the famous architect, S√©bastien Le Pr√©stre de Vauban (1679‚Äì81), resulting in the construction of the star-shaped fortresses and bridgeheads in both locations. The principal fortresses lay on the west side (French side) of the Rhine; the bridgeheads and the smaller fortifications surrounding those lay on the west side; these protected the various bridges, barrages and viaducts connecting the east and west sides of the river.Conrad Malte-Brun, Universal Geography, Or, a Description of All the Parts of the World, on a New Plan: Spain, Portugal, France, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, and Holland, A. Black, 1831 and Carl von Rotteck, General History of the World, (nl), C. F. Stollmeyer, 1842, p. 210.  Campaign of 1796  The campaign of 1796 was part of the larger, broader French Revolutionary Wars in which republican France pitted itself against a fluid coalition of Prussians and Austrians and several other states of the Holy Roman Empire, the British, Sardinians, Dutch, and royalist French emigres. Although initially the republican French experienced several victories, the campaigns of 1793 through 1795 had been less successful. However, the Coalition partners had difficulty coordinating their war aims, and their own efforts also faltered. In 1794 and 1795, French victories in northern Italy salvaged French enthusiasm for the war, and forced the Coalition to withdraw further into Central Europe. At the end of the Rhine Campaign of 1795, the French Republican called a truce between their forces that had been fighting in Germany.This agreement lasted until 20 May 1796, when the Austrians announced that the truce would end on 31 May.Ramsay Weston Phipps,The Armies of the First French Republic: Volume II The Arm√©es du Moselle, du Rhin, de Sambre-et-Meuse, de Rhin-et-Moselle Pickle Partners Publishing, 2011 reprint (original publication 1923‚Äì1933), p. 278. The Austrian Coalition's Army of the Lower Rhine included 90,000 troops. The 20,000-man right wing, first under Duke Ferdinand Frederick Augustus of W√ºrttemberg, then Wilhelm von Wartensleben, stood on the east bank of the Rhine behind the Sieg River, observing the French bridgehead at D√ºsseldorf. The garrisons of Mainz Fortress and Ehrenbreitstein Fortress included 10,000 more. The remainder of the Imperial and Coalition army, the 80,000-strong Army of the Upper Rhine, secured the west bank behind the Nahe River. Commanded by Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser, this force anchored its right wing in Kaiserslautern on the west bank while the left wing under Anton Szt√°ray, Michael von Fr√∂hlich and Louis Joseph, Prince of Cond√© guarded the Rhine from Mannheim to Switzerland. The original Austrian strategy was to capture Trier and to use their position on the west bank to strike at each of the French armies in turn. After news arrived in Vienna of Napoleon Bonaparte's successes, however, Wurmser was sent to Italy with 25,000 reinforcements, and the Aulic Council gave Archduke Charles command over both Habsburg armies and ordered him to hold his ground. On the French side, the 80,000-man Army of Sambre-et-Meuse held the west bank of the Rhine down to the Nahe and then southwest to Sankt Wendel. On the army's left flank, Jean-Baptiste Kl√©ber had 22,000 troops in an entrenched camp at D√ºsseldorf. The right wing of the Army of the Rhine and Moselle was positioned behind the Rhine from H√ºningen northward, centered along the Queich River near Landau, and its left wing extended west toward Saarbr√ºcken. Pierre Marie Barth√©lemy Ferino led Moreau's right wing at H√ºningen, Louis Desaix commanded the center and Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr directed the left wing. Ferino's wing consisted of three infantry and cavalry divisions under Fran√ßois Antoine Louis Bourcier and Henri Fran√ßois Delaborde. Desaix's command included three divisions led by Michel de Beaupuy, Antoine Guillaume Delmas and Charles Antoine Xaintrailles. Saint-Cyr's wing had two divisions commanded by Guillaume Philibert Duhesme and Alexandre Camille Taponier.Digby Smith, Napoleonic Wars Data Book, Connecticut: Greenhill Press, 1996, p. 111. The French plan called for a springtime (April‚ÄìMay‚ÄìJune) offensive during which the two armies would press against the flanks of the Coalition's northern armies in the German states while a third army approached Vienna through Italy. Specifically, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's army would push south from D√ºsseldorf, hopefully drawing troops and attention toward themselves, while Moreau's army massed on the east side of the Rhine by Mannheim. According to plan, Jourdan's army feinted toward Mannheim, and Charles repositioned his troops. Once this occurred, Moreau's army turned and executed a forced march south and attacked the bridgehead at Kehl, which was guarded by 7,000 imperial troops‚Äîtroops recruited that spring from the Swabian Circle polities, inexperienced and untrained‚Äîwhich held the bridgehead for several hours, but then retreated toward Rastatt. Moreau reinforced the bridgehead with his forward guard, and his troops poured into Baden unhindered. In the south, by Basel, Ferino's column moved quickly across the river and advanced up the Rhine along the Swiss and German shoreline toward Lake Constance, spreading into the southern end of the Black Forest. Worried that his supply lines would be overextended or his army would be flanked, Charles began a retreat to the east.Dodge, p. 290. See also Charles, Archduke of Austria. Ausgew√§hlte Schriften weiland seiner Kaiserlichen Hoheit des Erzherzogs Carl von √ñsterreich, Vienna: Braum√ºller, 1893‚Äì94, v. 2, pp. 72, 153‚Äì154. At this point, in July, the French had conquered most of the southern states of the Holy Roman Empire, forcing them into separate peace agreements. The French extracted large amounts of coin (hard specie) and materials to feed and clothe the troops. Despite their winning ways, though, the jealousies and competition between the French generals came into play. Moreau could have joined up with Jourdan's army in the north, but did not; he proceeded eastward, pushing Charles into Bavaria, while Jourdan pushed eastward, pushing Wartensleben's autonomous corps into the Ernestine duchies.Dodge, pp. 292‚Äì293. On either side, the union of two armies‚ÄîWartensleben's with Charles' or Jourdan's with Moreau's‚Äîcould have crushed their opposition.Dodge, pp. 297. This happened in August, Wartensleben's autonomous corpsAn autonomous corps, in the Austrian or Imperial armies, was an armed force under command of an experienced field commander. They usually included two divisions, but probably not more than three, and functioned with high maneuverability and independent action, hence the name \\"autonomous corps.\\" Some, called the Frei-Corps, or independent corps, were used as light infantry before the official formation of light infantry in the Habsburg Army in 1798. They provided the Army's skirmishing and scouting function; Frei-Corps were usually, but not always, raised from the provinces. See Philip Haythornthwaite, Austrian Army of the Napoleonic Wars (1): Infantry. Osprey Publishing, 2012, p. 24. Military historians usually maintain that Napoleon solidified the use of the autonomous corps, armies that could function without a great deal of direction, scatter about the countryside, but reform again quickly for battle; this was actually a development that first emerged first in the French and Indian War in the Thirteen British Colonies and later in the American Revolutionary War, and became widely used in the European military as the size of armies grew in the 1790s and during the Napoleonic Wars. See David Gates, The Napoleonic Wars 1803-1815, New York, Random House, 2011, Chapter 6. united with Charles' imperial troops and turned the tide against the French. The defeat of Jourdan's army at the battles of Amberg (24 August), W√ºrzburg (3 September) and 2nd Altenkirchen (16‚Äì19 September) allowed Charles to move more troops to the south, and effectively removed Jourdan from the remainder of the campaign.J. Rickard,Battle of Emmendingen, History of war.org. 17 February 2009, Accessed 18 November 2014. On 18 September 1796, General Petrasch's troops stormed the French-held bridgehead at Kehl. Although they originally pushed the French out, a prompt counter-attack forced them to retreat, leaving the French still in possession.  Preliminary action at Kehl: September 1796  While Charles and Moreau jockeyed for position on the eastern slope of the Black Forest, Franz Petrasch engaged the French at Bruchsal, where a sturdy bridge allowed for passage across the river. The troops there, under orders of General Marc Amand √âlis√©e Scherb, included the 68th Demi-brigade and two squadrons of the 19th Dragoons, had remained behind after the Battle of Ettlingen to observe the garrisons of Mannheim and Philipsburg, and to defend passage into France. An initial attack on the French positioned resulted in favor of the French, who charged the Austrians with bayonet, and pushed Petrasch's troops back. Realizing that his command was too small to withstand a concerted attack by the stronger Austrians, Scherb began a withdrawal. On 5-6 September, the Austrians and French spent most of the day skirmishing in advanced posts (Austrian) and rear guards (French); these skirmishes, though, masked the Austrian intention of approaching Kehl and securing the crossing over the Rhine between the village and Strasbourg. By 15 September, part of Scherb's force arrived in Kehl, after having been continually harassed between there and Bruchsal.Philippart, pp. 66-68. Once established in Kehl, this small cadre sought to strengthened the fortifications but the lack of cooperation from villagers and local peasants, and the exhaustion of the troops, prevented enhancements from proceeding with any speed.Philippart, p. 69. The Kehl garrison, under command of Balthazar Alexis Henri Schauenburg consisted only of one battalion of the 24th Demi-brigade and some detachments of the 104th. This was too weak to defend a position of such importance, or to develop additional extensive works. Recognizing Kehl's weakness, General Moreau detached a demi-brigade of infantry and a regiment of cavalry from his army in the Black Forest, with instructions to proceed by forced marches to Kehl, but General Petrasch sent Lieutenant Colonel Aspr√©, with two battalions, to occupy Renchen and to insure that Moreau's reinforcements did not augment the garrison at Kehl. Before the break of dawn on 18 September (03:45), three Austrian columns attacked Kehl. The principal column, comprising the Regiment Ferdinand, crossed the Kinzig river above the French position and proceeded toward the dykes of the Rhine above Kehl. This placed them between Scherb and his force, and Kehl. Using the dykes as protection, and guided by some peasants who had been previously employed in strengthening the Kehl defenses, they advanced as far as the horn work on the Upper Rhine and entered a gorge which led them to the outskirts of the village.Philippart, p. 71. The second column of the Regiment Ferdinand, under command of Major Busch, proceeded via Sundheim toward Kehl, and obtained possession of the village itself, although not the bridge leading to Strasbourg. The third column, which included three companies of Serbians and a division of hussars, executed a false feint on the left bank of the river. One corps of reserve under command of Colonel Pongratz, approached as far as the French earthworks on the banks of the Rhine to support the columns ahead of him; another, which included a battalion of the 12th Regiment, moved past the hamlet of Neumuhl () toward Kehl.Philippart, p. 72. Quickly, the Austrians possessed all the earthworks of the town, the village itself, and the fortress; their skirmishers reached one side of the abutment of the old palisade bridge and advanced to the other side, crossing the islands formed by branches of the Kinzig and the Rhine. They halted almost under the eyes of the French sentinels; there is some confusion about why they stopped, but apparently they mistook the abutment for the last bridge itself. The French executed several attempts to retake the bridges. The 68th, under command of general Jean-Baptiste de Bressoles de Sisce, was repulsed three times by the superior Austrian numbers and the murderous fire of case shot from four cannons that lined the principal road. The French cavalry tried to retire into Kehl via the Kinzig bridge, but heavy Austrian fire destroyed most of them. Not until 19:00 did fortune favor the French, when Lieutenant Colonel Aspr√© and two hundred men of the Regiment Ferdinand were captured within the fort itself. The next in command, Major Delas, was badly wounded, and there remained no one in overall command of the 38th Regiment. The French general, Schauenburg, who had gone to Strasburg for troops, returned with some reinforcements and met at once an impetuous Austrian attack.Philippart, pp. 73-74. At 22:00 the Austrians still held the redoubt and the houses at the edge of the village; the arrival of a fresh battalion of the Habsburg Regiment Manfredini led to a new attack, but it was repulsed. The Austrians had insufficient reserves to meet the fresh troops from Strasbourg. By 23:00, the French had recovered the fort, Strasbourg, the village of Kehl and all of the French earthen works.Philippart, p. 75.  Consequences  The Austrian failure to hold Kehl and the Strasbourg crossing in September 1796 gave Moreau some measure of security in his actions in the Black Forest and the southern flood plain of the Rhine. If the Austrians had held the crossing, General Petrasch's entire corps could have fallen upon the French army, at that time debouching through the Black Forest defiles and congregating in Freiburg. With sufficient forces, Petrasch also could have advanced as far as H√ºningen and carried its tete de point, which had fewer defenders than Kehl. Not only would this embarrass the French who had, up to that point, maintained a steady and secure retreat westward out of southern Germany, it would trap the French army in Germany between Petrasch and the approaching Archduke Charles. As it was, when Petrasch could not actually effect capture of the crossing, he was forced to remain outside Kehl, holding the approaches to the village.Philippart, pp. 76-77. Despite the limited success of Petrarsch's action, it had a broad impact on the movements of the main armies of Moreau and Archduke Charles. By preventing French access to the Kehl/Strasbourg crossing, Petrasch forced Moreau to move south; any retreat into France must happen via the bridges at H√ºningen.Thomas Graham, 1st Baron Lynedoch. The History of the Campaign of 1796 in Germany and Italy. London, (np), 1797, p. 126. After the Battle of Schliengen, though, Moreau had only one avenue of escape, via the smallest Rhine crossing at H√ºningen, which he used to move his army back to France. The question remained, however, who would control the crossings after the 1796 campaign. Charles had formulated a plan to circumvent that issue, and to free enough of his troops to send a relief force into northern Italy, where Dagoburt von Wurmser held Mantua against the French. If the French would agree to an armistice, he could take command of the Rhine fortresses; the French would withdraw, and he could send a sizable force to northern Italy to help relieve Mantua. The Siege of Mantua was long and costly, and had tied up a significant portion of both the French and Austrian force. The French Directory was willing to give up Mantua in exchange for the Rhine bridgeheads, which they deemed more important for the direct defense of France; Henri Jacques Guillaume Clarke, their envoy sent to negotiate between the Austrians and the French in Italy, could not convince Napoleon Bonaparte to allow the Habsburgs to keep Mantua. Napoleon flatly refused the suggestion, maintaining that Mantua was the keystone to the conquest of Habsburg Italy and to maintaining pressure on the Habsburgs in their capital of Vienna.Cuccia, pp. 87‚Äì93. Charles advised his brother of the French Directory's offer, but it was flatly refused by the Emperor and the civilian military advisers on the Aulic Council. Charles was instructed to lay siege to the fortresses, to take them, and secure any possible French access to southern Germany via the Rhine. The Aulic Council still believed Austrian forces could relieve Mantua. Consequently, by tying Charles down at the Rhine, besieging the highly defensible Vauban fortresses at the river at Kehl and H√ºningen, the Council effectively sealed the fate of Wurmser's troops in Mantua. After it became clear that Charles was locked into place on the Rhine, Moreau moved 14 demi- brigades to Italy, leaving behind modest forces on the French border.Digby Smith, Napoleonic Wars Databook, Greenhill Press, 1996, p. 126. Two Austrian columns sent from Vienna failed to reach their beleaguered counterparts in Mantua, which fell on 2 February 1797.

The island with the small fortress is Ehrlen. Once the Aulic Council refused Charles's plans, Latour engaged the main French force at Kehl and Charles entrusted to Karl Aloys zu F√ºrstenberg the command of the siege force at H√ºningen. Jens-Florian Ebert, \\"Feldmarschall-Leutnant F√ºrst zu F√ºrstenberg,\\" Die √ñsterreichischen Gener√§le 1792‚Äì1815. Napoleon Online: Portal zu Epoch . Markus Stein, editor. Mannheim, Germany. 14 February 2010 version. Accessed 28 February 2010. The process of laying siege in the eighteenth century was complicated. Most commonly, armies established positions around a city and waited for the surrender of those inside: if patience failed, they bribed or coerced someone inside to betray the fortification. An attacker, aware of a prolonged siege's great cost in time, money and lives, might offer generous terms to a defender who surrendered quickly. The defending troops would be allowed to march away unharmed, often retaining their weapons. As a siege progressed, however, the defender's position became more precarious. The surrounding army would build earthworks in a line of circumvallation to completely encircle their target, preventing food, water, and other supplies from reaching the besieged city. This was followed by the construction of a line of contravallation, especially if the besieged city had a nearby field army; the line of contravallation protected the besiegers.The Oxford Encyclopedia of Medieval Warfare and Military Technology. Siege Warfare. Oxford, Oxford University Press, pp. 266-267. Generally, time was on the side of the defenders; most armies could not afford to wait out the prosecution of a siege, especially of a well-fortified, well-provisioned city. Until the invention of gunpowder-based weapons (and the resulting higher-velocity projectiles), the balance of power and logistics definitely favored the defender. With the introduction of large-caliber mortars and howitzers (in modern times), the traditional methods of defense became less effective against a determined siege,R.R. Sellman. Castles and Fortresses. Methuen, 1954, pp. 44‚Äì45 although many of the trace italienne fortresses presented a formidable challenge well into the twentieth century.in the last days of World War II, during the Battle in Berlin, that saw some of the heaviest urban fighting of the war, the Soviets did not attempt to storm the Spandau Citadel (built between 1559 and 1594), but chose to invest it and negotiate its surrender. See Antony Beevor, Berlin: The Downfall 1945. New York, Viking- Penguin Books, 2002, pp.372-375.  Description of the fortifications  The principal bridge crossing the main part of the river began approximately 400 paces above the point at which the Kinzig river joined the Rhine. On one side of the confluence lay the hamlet of Auenheim; on the other the village of Neumuhl. The fortress stood between the bridge over the Rhine and the Kinzig. It was shaped as a polygon, approximately in length, and two of its sides faced the Rhine. The main wall was approximately high. Below two bastions, casemates, or fortified gun emplacements of long and wide, provided enfilade coverage. Behind these lay two other polygons, close the river, which held the magazines: these were high, long and wide. All walls were thick enough to repel most cannon fire. The inner spaces included a section of barracks that cold hold up to 1500 men; indeed, in an earlier bombardment in the hostilities in September 1796, the barracks, gun emplacements, and walls had withstood a lengthy Austrian barrage. The fortress had stone and mortar ravelins and each bastion had its own hornwork; the hornwork between the Rhine and the Kinzig was approximately in length. The hornworks themselves were faced with stone and mortar and had their own ravelines, a covered communication ditch, and an earthen glacis. Ferdinand Varnb√ºler von und zu Hemmingen, Beitrag zur Geschichte des Feldzuges vom Jahr 1796, Altona, 1797, pp. 46-48. The village of Kehl stood on one of the hornworks, built along a single long street. At one end lay the Commandant's Bridge, which crosses the \\"old water\\", a subsidiary channel approximately wide, separated from the main channel of the Rhine. Beside the old water, stood the Kehl church, graveyard, and portions of the hornwork, including an earthen dam that followed the shoreline of the river. The fortified wall by the churchyard, capped by a breastwork, had its own moat; the breast work had room for at least four cannons and 150-200 troops. This entire installation, called the churchyard redoubt, approximately wide, dominated the vicinity.Varnb√ºler, pp. 49-52. As the Rhine passed the church, it made a sharp curve; this curve and the water where it and the old water rejoin, created a small island known as the Marlener Island. In dry weather, it was more of a peninsula than an island; the exposed ground was called the Kehler Rheinkopf (Kehl's Rhine head, or bald head). The island was thick with bushes and shrubbery. Beside this lay a larger island, known as the Erlenkopf (Erlen head), which supported a battery of artillery (known as Battery 2). The battery was protected only by posts, or palisades, connected to the mainland by a light wood bridge guarded by infantry. The river by the bridge was approximately wide, and by the exposed islands were about wide.Varnb√ºler, pp. 42-55. In the other direction, between Kehl and the Schutter, which lay downstream, the fortifications were equally secured. The redoubt there held about 8 cannons and 400 men, and covered the street between the hamlet of Auenheim and Kehl.Varnb√ºler, pp. 45-58.  Conduct of the siege at Kehl  Strasbourg and Kehl, both built on land and over the river channels, had lengthy systems of bridges connecting the land works to each other, such as this one, the Vauban barrage. This is a modern view of the bridge. Realizing that the siege was imminent, the French had destroyed most of the village of Kehl on 26 October, as the Battle of Schliengen concluded and Moreau's army withdrew toward H√ºningen. Only the ruined walls of the church and post house remained.Philippart, p. 114. The French maintained control of the three main islands surrounding the Kehl crossings: Ilse de Estacade, Ilse de Escargots, and Isle de Ehrlin. Their control of these provided vital positions from which the French established their operations. The islands were connected to Kehl and to each other through a series of flying bridges (pontoon bridges); troops could also be moved by boat if necessary.Philippart, pp. 105, 108, 111‚Äì125. On 26 October, Baillet de Latour immediately lay the groundwork for a lengthy siege by ordering the construction of extensive earthworks around the bridgehead. The lines of contravallation (the trenches nearest to the French position) included a series of redoubts connected by trenches. Initially, the French considered these to be purely defensive and they were inclined to ignore the industrious Austrian diggers and focus instead on their own fortifications, which were sketchy and relied upon palisades unprotected by dirt; these could not withstand a vigorous attack until strengthened.Philippart, pp. 102-103. After several days of strengthening their outer works by 30 October, several artillery pieces were brought up to augment the outer defense. In addition, released from the main army after the Battle of Schliengen, General Dessaix arrived to command the fortress and augment the garrison with his troops. Subsequently, French reconstruction of the fortress and its defensive lines increased. Several minor sorties against the Austrian lines resulted. On 14 November 1796, Dominique Vandamme, commanding a column of Dessaix's force, directed a small group of skirmishers and hussars to attack the most forward of the Austrian posts. This successful sortie took eighty Austrian prisoners.Philippart, p. 103. On 21 November, while the Austrians constructed their trenches on the right bank of the Kinzig, the French planned for a considerable sortie against the lines of contravallation between the Kinzig and the Rhine.Philippart, p. 104.  Action of 22 November  At daybreak on 22 November, 16,000 infantry and 3000-4000 cavalry moved against the combined Austrian and W√ºrttemberg positions between the Kinzig and the Rhine. The French infantry departed from the small island of Erlen, in the Rhine, and from the left of the entrenchment camp. The first column forced the first two Imperial redoubts. Another penetrated the earthen works near the center and carried the village of Sundheim and the two redoubts that ran contiguously to the village. Three other redoubts between the two were not carried, though, and the Austrians sallied out of these fortifications and fell upon the French. This action was the principal assault on the Austrian/Imperial line and apparently took the besiegers by surprise. Latour and the archduke personally moved to the gap the French created, pulling six battalions of armed workmen and all the Austrian troops after them.Philippart, pp. 104-105. The French immediately ran into problems. Infantry intended to support the first wave did not arrive in time. The cavalry could not deploy properly, due to the marshy ground and close quarters. After four hours, the entire French sortie party withdrew, taking 700 prisoners, seven pieces of cannon, and two howitzers. The want of horses prevented them from taking another 15 pieces of cannon, which they spiked. According to French accounts, thick fog favored the Imperial action, because it prevented the French from reconnoitering. Furthermore, as Moreau reported later, the humidity on the ground impeded the march of their columns, although it is unclear how the fog impeded only French visual reconnaissance and march but not the Austrian's. Regardless, fighting was heavy. General Moreau himself was wounded in the head and his aide-de-camp L√©l√©e was badly wounded. General Desaix's horse was killed under him, and he received a contusion in his leg, and General Latour's horse was also shot from under him.Philippart, p. 106. This action convinced the French that the Austrian and Imperial forces were too numerous and too well-established for them to shake. The French instead focused their efforts on reinforcing their palisades, strengthening batteries, and developing the redoubts and earthen works.Philippart, pp. 107‚Äì113.  Expansion of the siege  Much of the Kehl fortification was built on old ruins. In particular, the oldest of the bridges, which had been largely destroyed earlier in the century, This was an ancient bridge of piles that had been largely destroyed earlier in the century, but which the French had been reconstructing. Where the old stakes remained, the French rebuilt the bridge; where the stakes were missing, they filled in gaps with pontoon spans resting on boats. By 28 November, the Austrians had constructed enough parallels and batteries to fire upon the oldest of the bridges crossing the river. The bridge was entirely demolished; the French repaired it; the Austrians demolished it again. It lay so directly in the line of fire of one of the batteries that it was an easy target. The French could not keep it intact three days straight and furthermore, its wreckage threatened a pontoon bridge immediately downstream. The Austrians continued to expand their works and erect new batteries. On 6 December, the Austrians opened fire simultaneously with their batteries, and maintained a day-long salvo. At four in the afternoon, they attacked a French position defended by 300 men. They succeeded in taking it, but the French recovered it with a counter-attacked, taking some prisoners. At the same time, though, the Austrians attacked another work, called the Bonnet de Pr√©tre, where only 20 men were posted. They secured it and afterward connected it to the network of fortifications.Philippart, p. 105, 118. This gave Austrian marksmen close access to the bridges, where they could pick off French defenders with musket fire. It also allowed sappers to tunnel under the bridgehead walls and engineers to establish artillery batteries that could fire at closer range to the walls. They built some new trenches on the left of the Schutter stream, by the entrance to the old village of Kehl. Similarly, the French had made several night sorties on the works of the besiegers. In these forays, they would chase the diggers out of the lines, but the Austrian reserves always recovered the works before the French could capture any cannons or destroy the construction. Consequently, every day, the Austrians expanded their works and erected new batteries. On 9 December, in the night, the Austrians attacked the French advanced posts at the ruins of the old post house and church of the old village of Kehl. The fighting was bitter and short, but the Austrians finally took the post, to be driven out the next morning. In this subsequent attack, at which Archduke Charles was present, the Austrians lost about three hundred men and an officer. They attacked again on the 10 and 11 December, but could not take the posts. The Austrians also launched fire ships to destroy the pontoon bridge, but these were repulsed and destroyed.Philippart, p. 118. The Austrians took the Ehrlinrhin, a large island on which several of the French reserve units had been positioned. General Lecourbe removed one of the flying bridges to cut off all hope of a (French) retreat, grabbed a standard and rallied a battalion to advance against the Austrians, repulsing them as far as their trenches. Lecourbe's quick thinking preserved half of the island for the French.Philippart, p. 122. In the following days, the Austrians incorporated the newly acquired territory into their massive lines and batteries. The opened trenches on the left (south) of the Schutter) at the entrance to the old village of Kehl; within the week, the Austrian batteries connected the ruins at Kehl with the left flank of the contravallation, and linked the entire line to one of the Rhine islands, now exposed by receding water. The lines of contravallation, formed of several redoubts, were joined by entrenchments that entirely encircled Kehl and access to the bridges. These began at a dyke near Auenheim, traversed the route to Rastadt and Offenburg, the course of the Kintzig and the Schutter rivers, encircled the village of Sundheim, and finished at the Bonnet de Pr√©tre. The Austrian troops on the island could cover the left flank and the entire besieging army was covered by considerable entrenchments on the Islands in the Kinzig. By the end of the week, the Austrian and Imperial defenses were connected in a grand parallel and a series of batteries in a semicircle around the village.Philippart, p. 115. The Austrians took the ruins of the church and the post house by bringing up artillery and bombarding the positions; this allowed them to complete the lines of contravallation.Philippart, p. 119. According to spies and deserters, the Archduke himself had been exhorting and cajoling his troops to lift their spirits, \\"prepared his troops by harangues and presents,\\" Moreau reported. On 1 January, after a lengthy salvo, 12 Imperial battalions attacked the outer redoubt and the right wing of the French entrenchment, drove the French out, and immediately took possession of the earthen works and six pieces of artillery. French reserves had not been able to traverse the Rhine in sufficient time; boats intended to transport such troops had been damaged by the lengthy cannon fire. The connecting bridges, which had also been damaged, were repaired quickly, but by the time these repairs had been made, the Austrians were deeply entrenched in their new positions and the French could not force them out. Even miners, who had dug under the trenches, were unable to blow up the redoubt.Philippart, pp. 118‚Äì121. Strasbourgers assist in the demolition of the Redoubt of Kehl on 9 January 1797. Once the surrender occurred, the French took everything they could move, leaving the Austrians naught but a pile of rubble.  Surrender  Day-by-day, over time, the Austrians increased pressure on the French, who hampered by the lack of bridges or appropriate transport, could not bring up enough reserves to preserve the lost ground. Boats were stove by fire of the cannon; by the time bridges were repaired and sufficient reserves could be moved, the Austrians were entrenched, and had brought up their artillery. The Austrians continued to advance their earth works, and perfect their batteries.Philippart, p. 121. At 10:00 on 9 January the French general Desaix proposed the evacuation to General Latour and they agreed that the Austrians would enter Kehl the next day, on 10 January (21 Niv√¥se) at 16:00. The French instantly repaired the bridge, rendered passable by 14:00, which gave them more than 24 hours to evacuate everything of value and to raze everything else. By the time Latour took possession of the fortress, nothing remained of any use: all palisades, ammunition, even the carriages of the bombs and howitzers, had been evacuated. The French ensured that nothing remained behind that could be used by the Austrian/Imperial army; even the fortress itself was but earth and ruins. The siege concluded 115 days after its investment, and following 50 days of open (digging) trenches, the point at which active fighting began.Philippart, p. 127.  Aftermath  Austrian losses amounted to 12 percent of total forces engaged, high for an eighteenth-century siege; the losses were due to sorties in which the French were able to inflict heavy damages. Gaston Bodart estimated that of the 40,000 men who participated on the Coalition side, 4,800 were lost.Gaston Bodart, Losses of Life in Modern Wars, Austria-Hungary. London, Clarendon Press, 1916, p. 40. Based on Moreau's Memoirs, John Philippart estimated that the Austrian losses were lower: 3,000 troops killed or wounded and 1,000 taken prisoner.Philippart, p. 279. The capitulation at Kehl on 9 January allowed Charles to send additional troops and heavy artillery to H√ºningen. On 2 February 1797, as the Austrians prepared to storm the bridgehead, General of Division Georges Joseph Dufour, the French commander who had replaced the deceased Jean Charles Abbatucci, pre-empted what would have been a costly attack, offering to surrender the bridge. On 5 February, F√ºrstenberg finally took possession. Francis II, the Holy Roman Emperor, appointed him as Colonel and Proprietor of the Infantry Regiment Nr. 36, which bore his name until his death in battle in 1799.

Louis Desaix led a rearguard action after Emmendingen, and crossed the Rhine north of Kehl. By 24 October, he had moved his forces south to assume command of the fortress and prepare for siege.

Hamilton and Rasmus Ole Rasmussen, \\"Population, Sex Ratios and Development in Greenland\\", Arctic 63, no. 1 (2010): 43‚Äì52. The Greenlandic Inuit (, ) are the indigenous and most populous ethnic group in Greenland.Indigenous peoples in Greenland at the International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs Most speak Greenlandic (Western Greenlandic, Kalaallisut) and consider themselves ethnically Greenlandic. People of Greenland are Citizens of the Realm of Denmark and are OCT-nationals, this also means that Greenlanders are EU citizens (due to Greenlands associated relationship with the European Union). Approximately 89 percent of Greenland's population of 57,695 is Greenlandic Inuit, or 51,349 people . Ethnographically, they consist of three major groups: * the Kalaallit of west Greenland, who speak Kalaallisut * the Tunumiit of Tunu (east Greenland), who speak Tunumiit oraasiat (\\"East Greenlandic\\") * the Inughuit of north Greenland, who speak Inuktun (\\"Polar Inuit\\") Historically, Kalaallit referred specifically to the people of Western Greenland. Northern Greenlanders call themselves Avanersuarmiut or Inughuit, and Eastern Greenlanders call themselves Tunumiit, respectively.Baldacchino, Geoffery. \\"Extreme tourism: lessons from the world's cold water islands\\", Elsevier Science, 2006: 101. (retrieved through Google Books) . Today, most Greenlanders are bilingual speakers of Kalaallisut and Danish and most trace their lineage to the first Inuit that came to Greenland. The vast majority of ethnic Greenlanders reside in Greenland or elsewhere in the Realm of Denmark, primarily Denmark proper (approximately 20,000 Greenlanders reside in Denmark proper). A small minority reside in other countries, mostly elsewhere in Scandinavia and North America. There are though a number of Greenlanders and Greenlandic families whom today are multiracial, mostly due to marriages between Greenlanders and Danish colonists as well as other Europeans. Regions The Inuit are descended from the Thule people, who settled Greenland in between AD 1200 and 1400. As 84 percent of Greenland's land mass is covered by the Greenland ice sheet, Inuit people live in three regions: Polar, Eastern, and Western. In the 1850s, additional Canadian Inuit joined the Polar Inuit communities.Hessel 11 The Eastern Inuit, or Tunumiit, live in the area with the mildest climate, a territory called Tunu or Tasiilaq. Hunters can hunt marine mammals from kayaks throughout the year. Language Kuupik Kleist, Prime Minister of Greenland, 2009‚Äì13 Nive Nielsen, Inuk Singer and songwriter from Greenland, 2016 Kalaallisut is the official language of Greenland. It is the western variety of the Greenlandic language, which is one of the Inuit languages within the Inuit-Yupik-Unangan family. Kalaallisut is taught in schools and used widely in Greenlandic media. History Greenlandic Inuit in 1903 The first people arrived in Greenland from the Canadian island of Ellesmere, around 2500 to 2000 BCE, from where they colonized north Greenland as the Independence I culture and south Greenland as the Saqqaq culture. The Early Dorset replaced these early Greenlanders around 700 BCE, and themselves lived on the island until c. 1 CE. These people were unrelated to the Inuit. Save for a Late Dorset recolonisation of northeast Greenland c. 700 CE, the island was then uninhabited until the Norse arrived in the 980s. Between 1000 and 1400, the Thule, ancestors of the Inuit, replaced the Dorset in Arctic Canada, and then moved into Greenland from the north. The Norse disappeared from southern Greenland in the 15th century, and although Scandinavians revisited the island in the 16th and 17th centuries, they did not resettle until 1721. In 1814, the Treaty of Kiel awarded Greenland to Denmark. The primary method of survival for the Thule was hunting seal, narwhal, and walrus as well as gathering local plant material. Archaeological evidence of animal remains suggests that the Thule were well adjusted to Greenland and in such a way that they could afford to leave potential sources of fat behind. European visitors to Northeast Greenland before the early 19th century reported evidence of extensive Inuit settlement in the region although they encountered no humans. In 1823, Douglas Charles Clavering met a group of twelve Inuit in Clavering Island. Later expeditions, starting with the Second German North Polar Expedition in 1869, found the remains of many former settlements, but the population had apparently died out during the intervening years. In 1979, the Greenlanders voted to become autonomous. There is an active independence movement. The population of Greenlandic Inuit has fluctuated over the years. A smallpox outbreak reduced the population from 8,000 to 6,000 in the 18th century. The population doubled in 1900 to 12,000 then steadily rose by around 100 people each year from 1883 to 1919. Tuberculosis caused a drop in the population, but after several decades of steady birth rates and commercial fishing over traditional hunting, the population reached 41,000 in 1980. Society Gender roles among Greenlandic Inuit are flexible; however, historically men hunted and women prepared the meat and skins. Most marriages are by choice, as opposed to arranged, and monogamy is commonplace. Extended families are important to Inuit society.\\"Greenland.\\" Countries and Their Cultures. Retrieved 6 Aug 2012. Greenland Inuit diet consists of a combination of local or traditional dishes and imported foods, with the majority of Inuit, aged 18 to 25 and 60 and older, preferring customary, local foods like whale skin and dried cod over imported foods like sausage or chicken. That study also reveals that those who grew up in villages only consumed local, Inuit cuisine foods 31 times a month and those who lived in Danish areas would consume local, Inuit cuisine 17 times per month. The reasons for the lack of traditional food consumption varies, but 48 percent of respondents claim that they wanted to have variety in their diet, 45 percent of respondents said it was difficult to obtain traditional foods, and 39 percent said that traditional foods were too expensive. The kinds of whale that have been historically hunted and consumed are the Minke and Fin whales, both are under watch by the International Whaling Commission (IWC). Greenland Home Rule implemented IWC quotas on aboriginal whale hunting, reducing hunting of Minke whales to a maximum of 115 per year and Fin whales to 21 per year. Art The Greenlandic Inuit have a strong artistic practice based on sewing animal skins (skin-sewing) and making masks. They are also known for an art form of figures called tupilait or \\"evil spirit objects\\". Sperm whale ivory (teeth) remains a valued medium for carving.Hessel 21 Customary art-making practices thrive in Ammassalik Island.Ingo 20 Ammassalik wooden maps are carved maps of the Greenlandic coastline, used in the late 19th century.

It took place around Onjong in present-day North Korea from 25 to 29 October 1950. As the main focus of the Chinese First Phase Offensive, the People's Volunteer Army (PVA) 40th Corps conducted a series of ambushes against the Republic of Korea Army (ROK) II Corps, effectively destroying the right flank of the United States Eighth Army while stopping the UN advance north toward the Yalu River. Background The Korean War began on 25 June 1950 when the North Korean Korean People's Army (KPA) attacked South Korea. The invasion was almost successful in conquering all of South Korea until the UN intervened, sending ground forces into the country under the command of the United States. The UN forces initially experienced early defeats until the Battle of the Pusan Perimeter, where the UN forces reversed the KPA's momentum. By October 1950, the KPA was effectively destroyed by the UN forces after the landing at Inchon, the breakout from the Pusan Perimeter and the UN September 1950 counteroffensive. Despite the strong objections from the People's Republic of China on North Korea's northern border, the US Eighth Army crossed the 38th Parallel and advanced towards the Sino-Korean border at the Yalu River. As part of the offensive to end the war, ROK II Corps, comprising the ROK 6th, 7th and 8th Infantry Divisions, was ordered to attack north towards the Yalu River through the village of Onjong on 23 October 1950. In response to the UN advances, Chinese Communist Party chairman Mao Zedong, ordered the People's Liberation Army's North East Frontier Force to enter North Korea and engage UN forces under the name People's Volunteer Army (PVA).. In order to stabilize the rapidly collapsing Korean front and to push back the advancing UN forces, Mao authorized the First Phase Campaign, a bridgehead-building operation with the aim of destroying the ROK II Corps,. the vanguard and the right flank of the US Eighth Army, advancing up along the Taebaek Mountains in the middle of the peninsula.. After the Chinese leadership finally settled the issue of armed intervention on October 18, Mao ordered the PVA to enter Korea on 19 October under strict secrecy.. Prelude Locations and terrain Onjong is a crossroad village located at the lower Ch'ongch'on River Valley, northeast of Unsan.. At the east of Onjong stands the town of Huich'on, the staging area of the ROK II Corps for the offensive. To the north, Onjong is linked to the town of Kojang, which is located at away from the Yalu River. Because of the hilly terrain at the Sino- Korean Border, Onjong is one of the few access points into the Yalu River area.. The terrain also limits troop movements while providing ideal grounds for ambushes. Forces and strategy On 24 October the ROK 6th Infantry Division of II Corps advanced westward from Huich'on, and Onjong was captured on the same day.. From Onjong, the ROK 7th Infantry Regiment, 6th Infantry Division turned north and advanced towards Kojang, while the ROK 2nd Infantry Regiment, 6th Infantry Division planned to advance northwest from Onjong towards Pukchin. Because the UN Command expected no opposition from the destroyed KPA, the advances were not coordinated between the UN units. As a result, the ROK 7th Infantry Regiment managed to wander into enemy territory without much opposition, completely oblivious to the new threats surrounding them.. While the ROK were advancing towards the Yalu River, the PVA were also trying to deploy their units for the upcoming First Phase Campaign. As the PVA Commander Peng Dehuai scrambled to set up his new command post at Taeyudong, the planned advance by the ROK 2nd Infantry Regiment threatened to overrun his position.. Without any KPA units nearby to hide the presence of the PVA, Peng was forced to start the First Phase Campaign early by moving the PVA 40th Corps to intercept the ROK 2nd Infantry Regiment near Onjong. On the night of 24 October the PVA 118th Division of 40th Corps arrived at its designated blocking position. Meanwhile, the PVA had set up numerous ambush positions on the ridges overlooking the Onjong-Pukchin road.. Battle Initial contacts On the morning of 25 October and with its 3rd Battalion on point, the ROK 2nd Infantry Regiment started to advance northwest towards Pukchin. The ROK soon came under fire to the west of Onjong. The 3rd Battalion dismounted from their vehicles to disperse what they thought would be a small force of KPA, but the two PVA regiments on the high ground immediately began pouring heavy fire onto the ROK left, front and right flanks.. The 3rd Battalion broke instantly, abandoning most of its vehicles and artillery along the way. About 400 survivors managed to escape the trap and fall back into Onjong. When the ROK 2nd Infantry Regiment learned that the 3rd Battalion was under heavy attack, its 2nd Battalion was moved forward to support the 3rd Battalion while its 1st Battalion was sent back to Onjong.. Although the 2nd Battalion was turned back after encountering strong resistances, the ROK managed to capture several Chinese prisoners who revealed that there were nearly 10,000 Chinese soldiers waiting down the road. At the same time, the PVA High Command ordered the PVA 120th Division of 40th Corps to join the battle while the rest of the 40th Corps was busy setting up roadblocks around Onjong. With all the roadblocks in place by midnight, the PVA 118th Division and one regiment from the PVA 120th Division attacked Onjong on 26 October at 03:30, and the ROK 2nd Infantry Regiment was dispersed within 30 minutes. Although Colonel Ham Byung Sun, commander of the ROK 2nd Infantry Regiment, managed to rally his troops east of Onjong, the PVA were still able to penetrate the new position within an hour.. At this point not a single company of the regiment was left intact, and the ROK 2nd Infantry Regiment ceased to be an organized unit. Approximately 2,700 men of the 3,100 in the regiment eventually escaped to the Ch'ongch'on River.. Two US Army Korean Military Advisory Group (KMAG) advisors were also captured. Second ambush The loss of surprise due to the early start of the First Phase Campaign greatly disappointed Mao.. Nevertheless, Mao still urged Peng to destroy the ROK by baiting them with trapped units.. At the same time, Major General Yu Jae-hung, commander of ROK II Corps, sent the ROK 19th Infantry Regiment, 6th Infantry Division (under Colonel Park Kwang Hyuk) and the ROK 10th Infantry Regiment, 8th Infantry Division (under Colonel Go Geun Hong) to recapture Onjong and to salvage the lost equipment from the battle. The ROK 7th Infantry Regiment, under the command of Colonel Im Pu Taek, was also ordered to retreat south with the ROK 6th Infantry Division. Hoping to draw the rest of ROK II Corps into the open, Peng ordered the PVA 118th Division to swing north and to trap the retreating ROK 7th Infantry Regiment,. while the PVA 119th and 120th Divisions would wait to ambush any rescue forces passing through Onjong. On October 27, the PVA 118th Division isolated the ROK 7th Infantry Regiment by cutting the road between Kojang and Onjong,. but the ROK 7th Infantry Regiment did not reach the roadblock due to the lack of fuel.. Upon realizing that ROK II Corps had not fallen for the deception,. Peng ordered the 119th and the 120th Divisions to destroy the ROK 10th and 19th Infantry Regiments. On the night of 28 October, the ambush by the two PVA divisions quickly decimated the advancing ROK regiments at the east of Onjong, and the PVA roadblocks in the rear areas forced the ROK soldiers to abandon all vehicles and artillery in order to escape.. The ROK 7th Infantry Regiment had now become the only surviving formation of the ROK 6th Infantry Division, but it too was ambushed by the PVA 118th Division on 29 October south of Kojang. The PVA 118th Division was ordered to wait for reinforcements from the 50th Corps, but the 118th Division attacked alone on the night of 29 October to prevent the ROK from escaping. After a two-hour battle, the ROK 7th Infantry Regiment was forced to disperse with its survivors scattered into the hills.. About 875 officers and 3,552 other soldiers managed to escape, while Major Harry Fleming of the Korean Military Advisory Group was wounded fifteen times and was later captured by the PVA... Aftermath With the loss of the ROK 6th Infantry Division and the ROK 10th Infantry Regiment, ROK II Corps was devastated, and effectively ceased to be an organized fighting force.. This meant the right flank of the US Eighth Army was completely open to the PVA, which were now advancing south to overwhelm the UN forces.. Exploiting the situation, the PVA launched another attack on the now exposed Eighth Army center, resulting in the loss of the ROK 15th Infantry Regiment and the US 8th Cavalry Regiment at the Battle of Unsan. With the PVA pouring into the rear of the UN lines, the Eighth Army was forced to retreat to the Ch'ongch'on River.. Only the stubborn defense of Kunu-ri by the US 5th Regimental Combat Team and the ROK 7th Infantry Division on 4 November managed to stop the PVA advance and prevented a disastrous defeat for the Eighth Army... By 5 November logistics difficulties forced the PVA to end the First Phase Campaign... Although the PVA were unable to exploit the breakthrough in the UN lines, the weakness of ROK II Corps on the Eighth Army's right flank was exposed to the PVA commanders.. During the planning of the PVA Second Phase Offensive, Peng would again focus his attention towards ROK II Corps at the Eighth Army's right flank, resulting in a disastrous defeat for the UN forces at the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River.. To commemorate this battle as China's official entry into the Korean War, 25 October is currently the War to Resist America and Aid Korea Memorial Day in China.

History In October 2015 the Trust Board agreed to pursue the possibility of a merger with the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust. In December 2017 the Health Service Journal reported that the two acute Trusts will appoint an interim joint board by the middle of 2018, and aim to formally merge by April 2019. It merged with the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust to form the Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust on 1 October 2019. Facilities Aintree University Hospital has sat on the same site as the Walton Centre for Neurology and Neurosurgery, since 1998. In 2013, Aintree became the first NHS organisation to become UKAS accredited under the Royal College of Physicians‚Äô (RCP) Improving Quality in Physiological diagnostic Services (IQIPS) programme for its Audiology services. Performance In October 2013 as a result of the Keogh Review the Trust was put into the highest risk category by the Care Quality Commission. In December 2013 the Trust was one of thirteen hospital trusts named by Dr Foster Intelligence as having higher than expected higher mortality indicator scores for the period April 2012 to March 2013 in their Hospital Guide 2013. The same report highlighted that the hospital‚Äôs HSMR mortality indicator was better than expected. The hospital has said that both indicators need to be considered to give a rounded picture and that a mortality reduction programme is underway. The Summary Hospital-level Mortality Indicator (SHMI) reports on mortality at trust level across the NHS in England using a standard and transparent methodology. It is produced and published quarterly as a national statistic by NHS Digital. The mortality figures for Aintree in January 2018 show that since April 2014 the SHMI for Aintree has been \\"as expected\\" throughout this time period. Work which was commenced following the first publication of SHMI (for 2012-13) has been continued and has reduced the SHMI since that time. Aintree was named \\"Large Employer of the Year\\" in the regional finals of the 2013 National Apprenticeship Awards. The hospital was also listed in the 2013 Top 100 Apprenticeship Employers list, which is produced by the National Apprenticeship Service and City & Guilds. Aintree‚Äôs staff flu immunisation campaign for 2013-14 was the best in the country. More than 83% of frontline staff had the flu jab before the campaign officially closed on 31 January 2014, the highest figure in the country. Four-hour target in the emergency department quarterly figures from NHS England Data from https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/ae-waiting-times- and-activity/ The trust was one of 26 responsible for half of the national growth in patients waiting more than four hours in accident and emergency over the 2014/5 winter. The trust was well below target for seeing A&E; patients promptly, it was slightly below target for planned operations and care but was above target for cancer care.Aintree University Hospital NHS Trust BBC The Care Quality Commission's most recent report, from September 2016, rated the Trust as Good overall.

The Stenkvista runestone, designated as runic inscription S√∂ 111 in the Rundata catalog, is a memorial runestone located near the church at Stenkvista, which is two kilometers east of Skogstorp, S√∂dermanland County, Sweden, which was formerly part of the historic S√∂dermanland, and which features a depiction of Thor's hammer, Mj√∂llnir. This runestone is one of several runestones in Scandinavia that has a dedication to Thor. While the tradition of carving inscriptions into boulders began in the 4th century and lasted into the 12th century, most runestones in Scandinavia date from the late Viking Age. Description The Stenkvista runestone, which currently lies in a churchyard, is made of granite and is 2.2 meters in height. It is classified as being in runestone style Fp. This is the classification for inscriptions where the runic text is characterized by runic bands that end with serpent or animal heads depicted as seen from above. The runemaster who carved this runestone placed a dot between the words in the runic text, arranged the design so that the runes √æiu√æmunt for the man's name √ûj√≥√∞mundr and fa√æur * sin for the words f√¥√∞ur sinn (\\"their father\\") are located below the Thor's hammer. Thor's hammer was used on several memorial runestones in Sweden and Denmark, perhaps as a parallel to or a pagan reaction to the use of the cross by Christians.

History Popularly believed to have been \\"constructed by the Visigoths\\", the √âtang de Montady was in fact built by monks and wealthy B√©ziers landowners during the second half of the 13th century after a 1247 authorization by the Archbishop of Narbonne.Carri√®re 1980. The exact dates when the work began or ended are not clear, but the landscape as it exists today was completed by 1268. The √âtang de Montady was drained to provide much- needed farmland for the Kingdom of France, which was then experiencing a population boom. This agricultural landscape exists today and can be seen from the Oppidum d'Ens√©rune, a nearby hill and historic settlement. Design and construction The area was drained by making radial ditches from a single center point out to the extremities. The water flows to this center point and is then drained by sixteen vertical shafts located approximately apart from each other to an underground culvert which flows through the Malpas hill and under the Malpas Tunnel of the Canal du Midi. The resulting agricultural plots are triangular due to the radial lines extending from the center. The original hydraulic infrastructure used to drain the √âtang is similar in design and construction to Arabic qanat, and may therefore trace its lineage to Al- Andalus or North Africa. It is also comparable to hydraulic engineering works designed and built by the Etruscans and Romans and used throughout the Mediterranean basin during antiquity, including at Albano and Fucino in Italy, at Faiyum in Egypt, and at Copais and Trichonida in Greece.

It has an area of , and most of it is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest. It is listed as a Grade 1 site in A Nature Conservation Review. The reserve is in several sections, mostly in the parish of Lewknor in Oxfordshire, with smaller sections in the parish of Stokenchurch in Buckinghamshire. The reserve is home to plants and butterflies of chalk grassland. The flowers include a number of orchids and the Chiltern gentian; the butterflies include the silver-spotted skipper and the Adonis blue. As well as chalk grassland, the reserve contains woodland with beech, yew, and juniper. Overhead, reintroduced red kites are resident. Diverse habitat Dew-pond at Aston Rowant NNR The Aston Rowant reserve is managed by Natural England assisted by the Oxford Conservation Volunteers. It offers a nationally important habitat of chalk grassland and juniper scrub with significant areas of hanging beechwood at Aston Rowant Wood. Flowers Aston Rowant is especially noted in spring and summer for the wildflowers and orchids associated with close-cropped chalk grassland, managed by careful grazing regimes. Orchid species recorded include common spotted orchid, fragrant orchid, pyramidal orchid, bee orchid, frog orchid, early purple orchid and greater butterfly orchid. Other flowers include eyebright, scabious, marjoram, Chiltern gentian, and yellow-wort.http://www.ocv.org.uk/sites.php?id=1 Butterflies The chalk grassland habitat is particularly attractive to many species of butterflies such as the Adonis blue, the chalkhill blue, marbled white, silver-spotted skipper, the dark green fritillary, and the silver- washed fritillary. Over 30 species of butterflies have been recorded on the reserve.

Aston Rowant is also an important conservation site for the endangered hazel dormouse. Reintroductions Interrupted brome grass, extinct in the wild at that time, was reintroduced to the reserve in 2004. In 1989, the Aston Rowant NNR became one of the initial four sites selected by the RSPB and Natural England for the reintroduction to England of the red kite, which had become extinct in England and Scotland due to persecution since the early 1900s, and reduced to a residual population of a few dozen pairs in central Wales. Initially birds were brought in from Spain but the reintroduction programme based in the Chilterns was so successful that the local population has now self-generated to a level of approximately 200 pairshttp://www.rspb.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/species/casestudies/redkite.asp and chicks are now taken from the Chilterns population for reintroduction projects elsewhere in the UK. In the summer of 2004, seeds of the interrupted brome grass, which had become extinct in the wild, were dispersed at the Aston Rowant NNR. The plants successfully germinated, fruited and persisted. This marked the first extinct plant to be re-introduced into the wild in British history.  M40 controversy  Chalk grassland hill slopes on the Chilterns escarpment, Aston Rowant NNR The M40 motorway passes through the reserve, where a cutting, the Stokenchurch Gap, drops the motorway down onto the Oxfordshire plain between Junction 5 Stokenchurch and junction 6 Watlington. This section of the \\"Midlands Link\\" motorway opened in 1974 after a Public Enquiry. The event helped to motivate conservation groups to oppose infrastructure projects that would damage protected natural habitats, such as the M3 cutting through Twyford Down near Winchester, which could have been protected by tunnelling.http://www.newsmedianews.com/m3.shtml  References  Category:National nature reserves in England Category:Nature reserves in Oxfordshire Category:Nature reserves in Buckinghamshire Category:Chiltern Hills Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Buckinghamshire Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Oxfordshire Category:Nature Conservation Review sites ","title":"Aston Rowant National Nature Reserve"},{"id":"25047886","text":"Roy Henry Gover (1929‚Äì2003) was a British painter and composer that was born in London in 1929. He emigrated to the United States (San Francisco Bay Area) in 1959. His work was the subject of a major one-man retrospective at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (1971). Early career Gover's original training was in commercial art. He graduated from the prestigious Willesden School of Art in North London, no longer extant. He worked in the advertising art trade in London and married (Jean), before the couple emigrated. In America they had two children (Kate and Jane). Gover continued to work in advertising art in the Bay Area but gradually found himself growing more compelled to pursue fine painting. The marriage ended and Gover struck out on his own as a painter, still doing random commercial work while trying to build a fine art career. Influences Gover's painting, influenced by such European modernists as Klee, Kandinsky and Dal√≠, comprised a kind of intimate visual diary, incorporating symbolic representations of memories and current events in his life. By the 1960s and early 70s his Bay Area reputation was at its height. He had exhibited in local museums and galleries and had multiple successful shows at the legendary Vorpal Gallery, enabling him to live on the earnings from his painting. By the mid-1970s he had grown disillusioned with the art market. Resisting promotion of his art, his reputation went into decline. He was ultimately forced to work in advertising art for the remainder of his life. Bay Area galleries still occasionally exhibit his painting. Later years Since his death in 2003, age 74, his reputation has taken on a new life among young music fans for the extemporaneous songs he performed and recorded at his home over the years. Some of these songs reflect bitterly upon his life in the advertising world. They were made as cassette tapes, which Gover sent to friends and acquaintances. He also made a CD of the songs in 1999 (produced by Tractor Beam). Original copies of the cassettes and CD are now rare, but their circulation has led to the development of a number of Gover fan sites on the internet.

Founded in 1925, it has grown to be one of Venezuela's largest banks. Services provided include deposits, checking and savings accounts, letters of credit, foreign currency transactions, electronic collections, commercial and personal loans, custody of securities, travelers checks and investment banking. The institution played a crucial role in the economic development of the country throughout the twentieth century, funding and developing key sectors of the economy, such as agriculture, livestock and basic services, including urban development. In 2001 the administration decided to form a universal bank by merging with Soficr√©dito and Sogecr√©dito. Since 2003 it has begun a process of rapid expansion, and was characterized by specializing in offering services to digital solutions and technology industries. The bank is ranked seventh in size by the SUDEBAN (the local financial regulatory agency), falling in the medium tier. In 2007 the bank had 103 agencies and offices across the country as well as a branch in the Cayman Islands and an office in Miami. History It was founded on 4 June 1925 by Henrique P√©rez Dupuy as Venezuelan Bank of Credit and authorized along with five other banks to issue currency on behalf of Venezuela in the absence of a central bank, making payments of roughly 15.43 million bolivars. During the government of General Eleazar L√≥pez Contreras, it financed much of the modernization projects of Caracas. In 1940 with the establishment of the Central Bank of Venezuela, banks were required to transfer gold reserves to support the printing of notes, which the bank refused to do. The refusal resulted in it being sued by the state through the Central Bank of Venezuela. However, in 1946 the bank made its first delivery of gold, valued at 10,000,000 bolivars, in exchange for the same amount of silver, but the conflict ended in 1956 when all notes issued by the bank were destroyed. In the 1980s the bank was a pioneer, along with one other bank, in offering the first interconnected ATMs through the technologically advanced Suiche 7B network in Venezuela. Then in 1996, it was the first Venezuelan bank to enter the New York Stock Exchange and two years later opened an office in the Cayman Islands. In mid-2002 it changed its name to the current Venezolano de Cr√©dito (Venezuelan of Credit).

Dunne as he appeared in the middle 1920s. William Francis \\"Bill\\" Dunne (1887-1953) was an American Marxist political activist, newspaper editor and trade unionist. He is best remembered as the editor of the radical Butte Bulletin around the turn of the 1920s and as an editor of the daily newspaper of the Communist Party USA from the middle-1920s through the 1930s. Dunne was founding member of the Communist Labor Party of America, but was removed from the national leadership of the party in 1934 and expelled in 1946 on charges of factionalism. Biography Early years William F. Dunne, known to his friends as \\"Bill,\\" was born October 15, 1887, in Kansas City, Missouri, the son of an Irish immigrant father and a French-Canadian mother.Theodore Draper, The Roots of American Communism. New York: Viking Press, 1957; pg. 316. His father was a railroad worker. According to American communist writer Myra Page, he had two brothers, Vincent Dunne and Miles Dunne, who sided with James P. Cannon (as \\"Cannonites\\") during the factionalism preceding formation of the Communist Party of the USA in 1928-1929, while Bill \\"stayed loyal\\" with William Z. Foster as a center, loyal \\"Fosterite\\" (the winning faction in 1929). Dunne grew up in Minnesota and attended the College of St. Thomas in St. Paul, a private, Roman Catholic institution.Clemens P. Work, Darkest Before Dawn: Sedition and Free Speech in the American West. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 2005; pg. 213. Dunne was forced to leave school in 1907 due to a financial panic, however. Dunne went to work on the Northern Pacific Railroad as an electrician, making a home in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. During World War I, Dunne returned to the United States from Canada, settling in Butte, Montana. Dunne later joined the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America.Solon DeLeon with Irma C. Hayssen and Grace Poole. The American Labor Who's Who. New York: Hanford Press, 1925; pg. 64. Dunne was married to a woman named Marguerite. The couple had one son, killed by an automobile in 1925. Political career Bill Dunne joined the Socialist Party of America in 1910.Branko Lazitch with Milorad M. Drachkovitch, Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern: New, Revised, and Expanded Edition. Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution Press, 1986; pp. 104-105. Dunne was elected Vice-President of the Montana Federation of Labor during World War I. Dunne also edited the Butte Bulletin, a paper established in December 1917 by the Montana Federation of Labor. Dunne stood down from this position in 1918 to run for political office and resumed the position following the end of his term of office in 1920, remaining at the post until 1921. In 1918, Dunne was arrested on charges of sedition for an anti-militarist editorial in the Bulletin.Work, Darkest Before Dawn, pg. 212. His trial finally began on February 20, 1919, in Helena, with his defense team led by Burton K. Wheeler.Work, Darkest Before Dawn, pg. 220. Following a three-day trial, during which Dunne was blasted as a \\"Bolshevist and an agitator,\\" Dunn was convicted and fined $5,000.Work, Darkest Before Dawn, pp. 221-222. This conviction was overturned by the Montana Supreme Court in May 1920, however, on the grounds of judicial error. The judge in the case had not allowed the defense to ask prospective jurors whether they could vote for acquittal if they should entertain a reasonable doubt that Dunne's editorial was \\"calculated to incite or inflame resistance\\" to the Montana state council of defense.Work, Darkest Before Dawn, pg. 223. In the fall of 1918, Dunne was elected as a Democrat to the Montana State Legislature in 1918, serving in that capacity through 1920. In the fall 1919, with the split of the Socialist Party into socialist and communist factions, Dunne made his exit to become a founding member of the Communist Labor Party of America, bringing the Butte Local with him into the new organization.Draper, The Roots of American Communism, pg. 317. In 1920, Dunne ran for mayor of Butte, but was the victim of electoral chicanery which denied him the seat. Despite his long tenure in the movement, Dunne was always regarded as a bit of a loose cannon in the Communist movement, as historian Theodore Draper recounts: > \\"Unlike most of the other former Socialists, Dunne was never completely > housebroken in the Communist movement. It seems that he tried to get to > Moscow in 1921 by working his way across on a boat bound for Stettin, > Germany [now part of Poland]. There he went on a spree with some shipmates, > invited the attention of the German police, and never reached his > destination. He returned to New York to add one more radical trade-unionist > to the new Communist leadership.\\" Dunne was a delegate to the ill-fated August 1922 convention of the Communist Party of America (CPA), held in Bridgman, Michigan.Benjamin Gitlow, I Confess: The Truth About American Communism. New York: E.P. Dutton, 1940; pg. 143. He was arrested when the gathering was raided by state and federal authorities for alleged violation of the Michigan state Criminal Syndicalism law. Released on bail, Dunne was never brought to trial on these charges. During the underground period of American communism, Dunne used the pseudonyms \\"Driscoll\\" and \\"Donovan.\\"Jeffrey B. Perry, \\"Pseudonyms: A Reference Aid for Studying American Communist History,\\" American Communist History, vol. 3, no. 1 (June 2004), pg. 71. At the end of 1922, when the underground CPA established its overground sibling, the Workers Party of America (WPA), Bill Dunne was elected one of three editors of the organization's weekly newspaper, The Worker.Tim Davenport (ed.), \\"The Communist Party of America (1919-1946): Party Officials,\\" Early American Marxism website. Retrieved November 11, 2009. Dunne served as the \\"Labor Editor\\" of that paper. Dunne was elected to the Central Executive Committee of the WPA and its Executive Council in 1923 and was re- elected by the convention for 1924. During the bitter factional struggles which swept the organization during the 1920s, Dunne was a supporter of the faction headed by William Z. Foster, Alexander Bittelman and James P. Cannon against that of John Pepper and C.E. Ruthenberg. Later in the 1920s, when Foster parted company with Cannon, Dunne allied himself with the latter.Bryan D. Palmer, James P. Cannon and the Origins of the American Revolutionary Left, 1890-1928. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2007; pg. 328. In 1923, Dunne was expelled from the American Federation of Labor for his communist political views and activity in organizing the so-called \\"left wing\\" of the labor movement through the Communist Party's trade union affiliate, the Trade Union Educational League. Dunne was a delegate to the 5th World Congress of the Communist International in 1924. He presented a report to the congress on the American racial situation and was elected as an alternate member to the Executive Committee of the Communist International. Dunne remained in Moscow during 1924 and 1925 as the representative of the Workers (Communist) Party of America to the Comintern. He was elected a member of the Comintern's Organization Bureau at the 5th Enlarged Plenum of the Communist International, held in March 1925. Later in 1925, Dunne returned to the United States to become an editor of the Communist Party's daily newspaper, The Daily Worker. Dunne was an occasional candidate for political office, running for U.S. Senator from New York at the 1926 New York state election, and for Governor of New York at the 1928 New York state election, both times on the Workers ticket. In 1928 he returned to Moscow as a delegate to the 4th World Congress of the Red International of Labor Unions (Profintern), as well as the 6th World Congress of the Communist International. Dunne was elected a member of the Politiburo of the CPUSA in 1929. In the early 1930s, Dunne returned to the Soviet Union, where he worked as a personnel specialist in charge of the 500 or 600 Americans working at the tractor plant in Stalingrad in 1931 and 1932. With the rise to power of Earl Browder in the American Communist Party from the middle-1930s, Dunne's position and authority in the party were reduced. He was removed from the national leadership in 1934, but he remained as an editor at The Daily Worker until 1936. Although Bill Dunne's brothers, Vincent, Miles, and Grant, were active in the American Trotskyist movement, participating in the Minneapolis Teamsters Strike of 1934, Bill Dunne was never part of that dissident communist movement.For more on the other three Dunne brothers, see Constance Ashton Myers, The Prophet's Army: Trotskyists in America, 1928-1941. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1977; passim. In 1934 he went so far as to author a polemic pamphlet for the Communist Party against his brothers and their comrades entitled Permanent Counter-Revolution: The Role of the Trotzkyites in the Minneapolis Strikes. During World War II, Dunne worked in the Navy shipyards. In 1946, Dunne was accused of having promoted a leftist faction in the Communist Party and was expelled. Death and legacy Bill Dunne died on September 23, 1953. He was 65 years old at the time of his death. Footnotes Works * William F. Dunne's Speech at the A.F. of L. Convention, Portland, 1923.

Roughly half of the nearly 70 members live at the monastery itself with the rest living in dependent houses. Formation St. Michael's Abbey accepts members who are between the ages of 18 and 29. The initial four years are spent in the monastery, studying the required novitiate courses followed by a three-year cycle in Thomistic philosophy, after which the brothers are sent to study at St Philip's Seminary in Toronto, Canada, under the direction of the fathers of the Toronto Oratory. Upon completion of the three-year course in theology the students are granted the masters in theology degree. During this period or immediately after there is required a one-year apostolic experience usually at the Abbey's Preparatory School. Following solemn profession all are required to have one year in Rome while living at the Norbertine Generalate and pursuing courses in pastoral theology at the Angelicum, the pontifical university under the direction of the Dominican Order. The association between the Abbey and the Angelicum dates back to 1973. At the conclusion of this formation the brothers may then be ordained as deacons and then priests before beginning to serve in the various ministries of the Order. History Hungarian Origins The Abbey was founded in 1961 by seven priestsLA Times, Retrieved 2009-11-11. from the Norbertine Abbey of St. Michael in Csorna, Hungary, whose roots go back to the 12th century. The founders originally left Hungary to avoid oppression soon after Communist officials nationalized Catholic schools in 1948. On the night of July 11, 1950, word came to the abbey in Csorna that the police would arrive the next day to arrest the confreres and suppress the community. That night, seven priests left, in two groups, to hike across country to the Austrian border. Several of the confreres, arriving in New York in 1952, were welcomed by the Abbey of St. Norbert in De Pere, Wisconsin, with whom they worked for several years, saving money to begin their own monastery. Foundation in California At the invitation of Cardinal James Francis McIntyre, Archbishop of Los Angeles, they first moved to Santa Ana, California in 1957 and taught at Mater Dei High School, establishing a monastic community the next year. The founding abbot was the Rt. Rev. Ladislaus Parker, O.Praem. In 1960 the Norbertine Fathers purchased the current site from Jack Cook, the founder of nearby Cook's Corner.BikerWear, 2 Jan 2010. St. Michael's opened a junior seminary in 1962, which evolved into the present day St. Michael's Preparatory School. The status of Abbey was conferred on St. Michael's in 1984. Recent History The current abbot is The Rt. Rev. Eugene J. Hayes, O.Praem., J.C.D., S.T.L. He was elected for a life-time term as abbot with a mandatory retirement age of 75 years on June 27, 1995 and received the abbatial blessing on September 15, 1995. More recently, plans have developed for an expansion project to develop a new site, due in part to geological instability at the current Abbey. In the early part of 2018, the building campaign attained its goal of $120 million. The groundbreaking for the new abbey took place at the site of 327 acres in Silverado Canyon on March 18, 2018. Construction is expected to take around 2 years. =Bethlehem Priory= In 1997 the abbey founded a convent of Norbertine nuns in Tehachapi, California.> On January 29, 2011, the sisters community in Tehachapi was incorporated into the worldwide Norbertine Order. In a ceremony at St. John the Baptist Cathedral in Fresno, the first nine sisters made their solemn profession as members of the newly established Canonry of the Bethlehem Priory of St. Joseph, in the hands of the Norbertine Abbot General, Most Reverend Thomas Handgratinger. Their total membership is 20 sisters, the majority of whom are still in stages of formation before perpetual vows. In that same ceremony the abbot of St. Michael's Abbey, Abbot Eugene, was named the father abbot of the Sisters' Canonry and as such serves as the sisters' external superior.

His primary areas of interest and inquiry include performance-oriented architecture, embedded architectures - architecture and environment integration, and advanced data-driven design.Hensel M. (2013). 'Performance- oriented Architecture ‚Äì Rethinking Architecture and the Built Environment His work is located in the intersection between architecture, landscape architecture, urban design, micro-climatology and ecology. Early life Hensel was born in Celle, Germany in 1965, and lived during his early years in Cologne. He gained his diploma in architecture from Cologne University of Applied Sciences in 1992, his graduate diploma from the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London in 1993, and his PhD from the University of Reading School of Construction Management and Engineering in 2012. Career Hensel has developed a theoretical and methodological approach to architectural design entitled \\"Performance-oriented Architecture\\" that incorporates notions such as non-discrete architecture and non- anthropocentric architecture and \\"Embedded Architectures\\". Performance- oriented architecture focuses on architecture and environment interaction, while the embedded architectures approach takes this further and focuses on architecture and environment integration. In 1994 Hensel co-founded the interdisciplinary design network OCEAN. Works of OCEAN are included in the Prints and Photographs Division of the Library of Congress in the United States and the FRAC Centre (Fonds Regional d'Art Contemporain) in Orl√©ans, France and were exhibited in various Venice Architectural Biennials and other high-profile venues. From 2008 to 2018 Hensel served as founding and acting chairman of the OCEAN Design Research Association OCEAN which was an international not-for-profit association registered in Norway. From 2011 to 2015 Hensel served as founding and acting chairman of SEA ‚Äì Sustainable Environment Association an international not-for-profit association in Norway. SEA was an interdisciplinary expert network that pursued systematic, integrative and interdisciplinary inquiry into the human-influenced and built environment and its interaction with the natural environment and local ecosystems with the aim to develop alternative approaches to architectural design and sustainability. In 2015 SEA fused with the OCEAN Design Research Association. Since 2018 he directs OCEAN Architecture  Environment, a practice located at the intersection of architecture, landscape architecture, urban design, climatology and ecology. From 2007 to 2011 Hensel served as board member of BIONIS, the Biomimetics Network for Industrial Sustainability. BIONIS was located at the University of Reading. Its mission was to promote the application of Biomimetics in products and services and its use in education and training. Hensel taught at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London (1993 to 2009), where was Unit Master of Diploma Unit 4 and where he co-founded and directed the Emergent Technologies and Design Program (EmTech).Hensel, M., Menges, A. and Weinstock, M.

He served many advisory roles in national and international financial institutions, and was an active researcher in the fields of finance and financial engineering. Neft√ßi was an avid and highly regarded educator in mathematical finance who was well known for a lucid and accessible approach towards the field. Background Salih was born into a prominent wealthy Turkish family with ties to the oil business (neft is Arabic for oil). Until he was 11, he lived in Kirkuk, Iraq, but then moved to Istanbul. His mother, Nermin Neft√ßi was the vice chairman of Turkish parliament, and the first woman in Turkey to be so. His father moved along with the rest of the family to Turkey. He received his B.S. in Economics from the Middle East Technical University and his Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Minnesota in 1977. His dissertation is entitled \\"Three essays in business cycle research.\\" Throughout his life, Salih maintained close links with U.S. academia and Wall Street. Neftci was diagnosed with Gliosarcoma, a type of malignant brain cancer and died on April 15, 2009. In November 2009, the Salih Neftci Memorial Scholarship Fundhttp://mfe.baruch.cuny.edu/baruch- mfe-salih-neftci-memorial-scholarship was endowed in perpetuity at Baruch College to help promote education and awareness of the financial engineering field of study. Teaching and Research Salih was one of the most productive researchers in financial engineering and taught in the areas of numerical methods of asset pricing, the mathematics of financial derivatives, emerging market asset trading strategies, and advanced risk management. Early in his career, Neftci specialized in econometrics and macroeconomics. He produced classic papers on relationships among aggregate time series, especially wages and employment, over the business cycle, which appeared in the very best journals in economics and statistics, including Econometrica, the Journal of Political Economy, the Journal of the American Statistical Association, and the Review of Economics and Statistics. Starting in the late 1980s, he turned his attention to finance and produced seminal books on the mathematics of financial derivatives and the principles of financial engineering. He arguably is best known for two particularly well-received textbooks on mathematical finance: An Introduction to the Mathematics of Pricing Financial Derivatives and Principles of Financial Engineering. These books have become standard texts in many financial engineering programs around the world. One of financial engineering's most eminent and visible practitioners and educators, Paul Wilmott, has written of An Introduction to the Mathematics of Financial Derivatives:Paul Wilmott Introduces Quantitative Finance (Wiley 2001), pp 136. { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"10\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" align=\\"center\\" width=\\"90%\\" style=\\"background-color: #EEEEEE;\\" Neftci (1996) is the only readable book on stochastic calculus for beginners. It does not assume any knowledge about anything. It takes the reader very slowly through the basics as applied to finance. } He taught at Boston College, George Washington University, and Fordham University before assuming a position in the Ph.D. Program in Economics at the CUNY Graduate Center in 1982. He remained at that institution for the next 26 years. During part of that time, he also taught in the Financial Engineering Masters Program at Baruch College,http://mfe.baruch.cuny.edu which also is part of CUNY. In January 2008, Neftci left the Graduate Center for a position at the New Schoolhttp://www.newschool.edu/nssr/subpage.aspx?id=9096 in New York. He had the foresight to encourage the New School to establish a program in global finance, which in his words ‚Äúoffers state-of-the art information resources and quantitative tools and techniques needed by the 21st century international financial profession.‚Äù At the time of his death, he was Professor of Economics at the New School University in New York City, Director of the Master of Arts Program in Global Political Economy and Finance at that university, Director of the Financial Engineering and Asset Management (FAME) Certificate Program at the Swiss Finance Institute and the University of Lausanne in Switzerland, a frequent lecturer in finance at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and at the International Capital Market Association Centre (ICMA) in the Business School for Financial Markets at the University of Reading in England, a consultant to the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the U.S. Department of State, and the Agency for International Development, and a newspaper columnist in Turkey and China. He held a seat on the Fitch Ratings Advisory Board from its inception in 2005.

Early life, 1884 ‚Äì 1898 Parsons was born in Peckham in Surrey on 23 January 1884, the 12th and youngest child of Arthur William Parsons (1838‚Äì1901), a foreign language translator, and Emma Matilda Parsons, n√©e Bergemann (1837‚Äì1914). He was christened with the names Charles Bergemann, though the family always called him Karl, the name he was to use in later life. From 1893 to 1898 he attended Haberdashers' Aske's Hatcham Boys School at New Cross in south London. Introduction to Whall, 1898 ‚Äì outbreak of war Garden party at Whall's house. Karl Parsons standing back row, first left. One of Parsons‚Äô older sisters was the artist Beatrice Emma Parsons (1869‚Äì1955). Beatrice worked for a while in Christopher Whall‚Äôs studio and when Parsons left school, Beatrice persuaded Whall to take him on as an apprentice. Whall it seems saw promise in Parsons' sketches. Apart from starting with Whall as a pupil- apprentice at Whall‚Äôs Hammersmith studio, he also worked at Lowndes and Drury in Chelsea, this under Whall‚Äôs supervision. He also attended Whall‚Äôs classes at the L.C.C. Central School of Arts & Crafts. Chalk drawing of St Cecilia playing the organ. He completed his apprenticeship in the 1900s and then worked as one of Whall‚Äôs assistants. In September 1904 he began teaching at the Central School, initially as one of Whall‚Äôs assistants and then as principal teacher of stained glass. One pupil was M. E. Aldrich Rope, cousin of Margaret Agnes Rope. Another pupil was Joan Fulleylove who worked with Mabel Esplin and in fact continued Esplin's work for the Anglican cathedral in Khartoum when Esplin could no longer do so. Throughout the 1900s he was to assist Whall on his major commissions and in 1905 drew some of the illustrations for Whall‚Äôs book Stained Glass Work this along with fellow student Edward Woore. Parsons assisted Whall with the windows for Gloucester Cathedral and also those for Canterbury Cathedral, Southwell Minster, Tonbridge School Chapel, and churches in Ashbourne, Ledbury and Burford. In 1907 he married Grace Millicent Simmons. She too studied at the Central School and became an Arts and Crafts embroiderer. In 1908 he worked with Whall on the design and execution of apse windows for Cape Town Cathedral and in that year set up his own studio at the Glass House in Fulham. In the same year he began work on his first independent commission, a series of windows for St Alban, Hindhead. He also exhibited three designs at the Royal Academy and 25 September 1908 saw the birth of his daughter Margaret Rosetta. It was the architect Herbert Baker who had asked Whall to take on the Cape Town windows and it was Baker‚Äôs associate Fleming, who in later years was to invite Parsons to undertake other commissions in South Africa. Close connections with architects were important to people like Parsons and he was to have a similar relationship with Robert Lorimer in Scotland which was to lead to his receiving important Scottish commissions. Other important contacts were John Duke Coleridge, and Everard and Pick. Whall had similarly benefitted from close ties to the likes of the architects John Dando Sedding and Henry Wilson. During the period 1909 to 1910, he worked for a short period with Louis Davis, cartooning windows from Davis‚Äô designs. In 1910 he exhibited designs at the Arts and Crafts Exhibition. Certainly Parsons worked closely with Davis in 1910 on the windows for St Anseln church (seven lancets for the Holy Spirit chapel) and Holy Trinity in St Andrew‚Äôs Fife (a five-light Crucifixion window). It was Davis who had introduced Parsons to Robert Lorimer. In 1910, Parsons lived at 38 Gainsborough Road in Bedford Park, London. 1911 saw the birth of his second daughter, Jacynth Mary, who became a book illustrator. In 1912 he received a commission for the Rolls and Grace memorial window at Eastchurch on the Isle of Sheppey and in the next year his work was exhibited at the Ghent International Exhibition. It was in 1913 that Parsons met the Irish artist Harry Clarke. One was to influence the other. 1914 ‚Äì 1930 Detail of a stained glass window (1919), Church of St Laurence, East Harptree 'Peace' window detail (1922) Christ Church, Fulham The Great War saw many of the Glass House staff leave to do military service and in 1916 Parsons himself was conscripted into the Army but was not posted overseas. Demobilised in 1918, he resumed work at the Glass House and went back to teaching at the Central School. As a teacher, Parsons was, like Whall before him, to inspire several of his pupils to become stained glass artists, including Lilian Pocock, Joseph E. Nuttgens and Herbert Hendrie. After the war there was a boom in demand for stained glass, particularly with many memorial windows being commissioned and Parsons appointed Edward Liddall Armitage as an assistant and later Leonard Potter. Both were ex-pupils. 1924 saw Parsons make what was to prove a seminal visit to Chartres where, with his brother Ambrose, he carried out a detailed study of medieval glass. Parsons wrote \\"So far as my knowledge goes, this world cannot show anything made by men so amazingly beautiful\\". In 1927 he was commissioned to make the apse windows for the new St Mary‚Äôs Cathedral in Johannesburg. 1929 saw a collection of poems that he had written published by the Medici Society under the title Ann‚Äôs Book. His daughter Jacynth provided the illustrations. (The previous year she had illustrated Forty Nine Poems by W. H. Davies, also for Medici). Over the years Parsons had several of his poems published in anthologies and periodicals. In the same year he resigned from his teaching post at the Central School. 1930 to 1934 ‚Äì final years In 1930 Parsons moved from Northwood, where he had lived for many years, to Shalbourne in Wiltshire. There he set up a studio at Ropewind Farm where he converted a mid-18th century three-bay barn, adding a large, porch-like window to let in natural light on the north side. He also incorporated a small granary on unusual brick and timber staddles thus converting it into a larger purpose-built storage building and garage, giving access directly from Rivar Road. The house he lived in adjoined the site. It should have been an idyllic time for Parsons but his health deteriorated and finally, in 1933, he had to return to London, took a flat in Putney and worked for a while with his great friend Edward Woore. He died there the following year at the young age of 50. After his death on 30 September 1934, the cause of death being given as cerebral thrombosis and arteriosclerosis, existing commissions were taken over or completed by Woore.

In the end, and notwithstanding that impression of the complainant, bearing in mind the forensic difficulties of the defence occasioned by the very long delay, some valid criticism of the complainant's credibility, the lack of corroborative evidence and the sworn denial of the respondent, I find I am not 'satisfied that the complaint has been established', to quote the words of the principal term of reference.\\"Report of an inquiry into an allegation of sexual abuse against Archbishop George Pell, Commissioner Hon. A.J. Southwell, 2002, p.12. Doubts about the handling of the accusation Doubts about the handling of the accusation arose following the publication by the Australian Herald Sun on 6 October 2002 of details about the accuser, whose anonymity had been preserved in previous media coverage. As relayed by the Zenit news service, \\"Pell's alleged victim was, it turned out, a career criminal. He had been convicted of drug dealing and involved in illegal gambling, tax evasion and organized crime in a labor union. A commission probing the corrupt union even devoted a whole chapter of its report to this man's activities. As the inquiry report noted: 'The complainant has been before the court on many occasions, resulting in 39 convictions from about 20 court appearances.'\\" References Category:Catholic Church sexual abuse scandals in Australia Category:2002 in Australia Category:2002 in Christianity Category:2000s in Victoria (Australia) ","title":"Southwell inquiry"},{"id":"25048515","text":"Concentration camp badge of prisoner in a Strafkompanie.

Born in Jacksonville to deaf parents, he attended high school, prominent in athletics and speech. He enlisted in the Air Corps in 1928 but was forced out of service due to a previously sustained knee injury. Seeking political office in 1934, he became county commissioner of St. Johns County. Eight years later, he successfully ran for a seat in the Florida House of Representatives, but later resigned due to acceptance into the U.S. Army. Shortly upon his return from oversees that saw him win awards for his service, in 1948, he ran, again successfully, as a senator for St. Augustine in the Florida Senate. Among the 24 years he served, he was involved in many important issues and held positions like President pro tempore and President of the Senate. He was forced into retirement in 1972 by bone cancer and died of it the year after. Early life Pope was born at Jacksonville in 1903 to two deaf parents, Artemus and Cora Carlton Pope, who were in the first graduating class of the Florida School for the Deaf and Blind in St. Augustine. As a child, Pope and his family moved multiple times around the state of Florida before settling in St. Augustine. He learned sign language to communicate with his parents and did not start speaking until he was seven years of age. He dropped out of school at the age of 14 and fabricated his age to join the United States Army, but this was soon discovered and he was forced back home to finish high school, when he honed oratory and athletic skills. Upon finishing high school, he enrolled in the University of Florida where he hoped to have a prosperous football career. However, he suffered a torn cartilage in his knee shortly thereafter from football that forced him out of the university altogether and back home. He then joined the United States Air Corps in 1928, but the knee injury he had previously sustained forced him out of that, as well. Political career Pope in 1961 In 1934, he first sought public office as St. Johns County Commissioner, winning and defeating the incumbent by 26 votes. He was elected to the Florida House of Representatives for St. Johns County to serve in the 1943 session, but soon thereafter resigned to join the U.S. Army to fight in World War II. During his years of service, which ended in December 1945, he won an Air Medal and Croix de Guerre while serving in Europe. Almost immediately upon his return to the Florida, Pope returned to politics, running for and winning a seat in the Florida State Senate in 1948. Sitting as a senator for the next 24 years, Pope was involved in many major decisions during his term, including a revision of the state constitution in 1968, improvements to deaf and blind schooling, and establishing a community college system. He was opposed to reapportionment and was a vehement advocate for the deaf and blind. Pope also led the senate on two occasions serving as the president pro tempore from 1964 to 1965 and the president of the senate from 1966 to 1968. His all-time goal in politics was to become Governor of Florida, preparing a run that was halted by the severe illness of his wife in 1960. He won awards for \\"The Most Valuable Member of the Legislature\\" in 1961 and \\"Third Most Valuable Member of the Senate\\" in 1967. He was diagnosed with bone cancer in 1972 and did not seek re-election to the senate that year, returning to a private insurance business. Personal life and death In his spare time, he enjoyed hunting, fishing and golfing. Pope married a noted Floridian novelist, Edith Taylor Pope in 1933. Upon her death in 1961, he made several donations in her memory towards historic preservation and education in St. Augustine. Among these was a donation to the Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board's project of reconstructing the Pellicer-De Burgo House downtown. Pope died in July 1973 of the bone cancer previously diagnosed a year ago after weeks of deteriorating health, including losing his voice that he was once known for. Survivors included daughter, Mrs. Richard O. Watson; a sister, Mrs. Wanda Pope Wilson and a brother, Eugene \\"Neil\\" Pope of St. Augustine. His funeral of over 500 people was attended by many prominent Floridian politicians, including former governors Fuller Warren, Farris Bryant, Haydon Burns, Charley Johns, LeRoy Collins along with senator Lawton Chiles and then-governor Reubin Askew. He was later interred at Evergreen Cemetery in St. Augustine alongside his wife. Legacy Known affectionately as \\"The Lion of St. Johns\\" from his white flowing hair and \\"roaring\\" speaking skills, Pope is known mostly for breaking the \\"rural hold\\" on the state legislature. On reflection of his senate career, he remarked \\"I didn't get much legislation passes but I sure helped get a lot of bad bills killed.\\" Upon his death in 1973, many prominent state politicians paid tributes to him, among them, U.S. Senator Lawton Chiles stating that \\"His life was a beacon and standard to everyone of what a politician and public servant can be.\\" Then- governor Reubin Askew also paid tribute, saying \\"Florida has lost one of its most dedicated sons and I have lost a dear friend who was almost like a father\\". He was honored with a senate resolution in 1974. The school that his parents graduated from was also renamed \\"The Verle Allyn Pope School for the Deaf and Blind\\" in a unanimous resolution that same year.

Ottawa : E. Cloutier, Printer to the King, 1946.publication.gc.ca was a royal commission appointed by Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King on behalf of the Government of Canada under Order in Council PC 411 on February 5, 1946. The Commission was mandated to investigate the allegations set forward by Soviet defector Igor Gouzenko that a spy ring of Canadian Communists was handing over secret information to the Soviet Union, later referred to as the \\"Gouzenko Affair\\". Notable among the thirteen accused of passing over secrets were Fred Rose, the Labor-Progressive Party Member of Parliament for Cartier, and Sam Carr, a senior organizer of the Labor- Progressive Party. The commission was headed by two judges of the Supreme Court of Canada, Justice Robert Taschereau and Justice Roy Kellock. Counsel included President of the Canadian Bar Association E.K. Williams, D.W. Mundell, G√©rald Fauteux, and John Robert Cartwright. The Commission was hurriedly convened when rumours in Washington suggested journalist Drew Pearson was about to disclose that Canada was secretly investigating Russian spy rings that might extend into the USA. Several Canadians named in Gouzenko's documents were immediately arrested and sequestered until summoned before the royal commission. Evidence before the commissioners suggested at least two Soviet espionage networks were active in Canada in wartime, one targeting the Manhattan Project.Summarized in The Gouzenko Transcripts, ed. Robert Bothwell and J.L. Granatstein (Ottawa: Deneau Publishers n.d.(1982)). About 20 Canadian suspects were tried in 1947-48 for espionage. Ten were convicted and punished in a range from five years imprisonment to a $500 fine, seven were judged not guilty and two more acquitted on appeal. British nuclear scientist Alan Nunn May was arrested in England in March, 1946 and pleaded guilty; British nuclear scientist Klaus Fuchs remained at work undetected until identified by Venona in 1949. The impact of the Kellock‚ÄìTaschereau Commission was far-reaching, first because people implicated in Gouzenko's documents were secretly arrested and denied legal advice, under emergency wartime regulations, and an \\"Emergency Committee for Civil Rights\\" assembled to defend them. Executive members included C.B. Macpherson, Leopold Infeld and A.Y. Jackson. Their advertisement in the Toronto Star said the Commission endangered the \\"basic rights of Canadians\\" and did \\"violence to the rights of free men.\\" They compared the Kellock‚ÄìTaschereau Commission to the trial of Lt.-Col. John Lilburne during the English Civil War of 1649, stating \\"the methods of the Commission are not new. They were used against Englishmen in 1649 and against Canadians in 1946.\\"Toronto Star. June 1946. \\"The Methods of the Kellock-Taschereau Commission\\" http://www.historyofrights.com/PDF/cru_rcespionage_ad.pdf Whatever the implications for civil and legal rights, the \\"Gouzenko inquiry\\" provided the first judicial evidence in North America of proved Communist spies, among the first events of the Cold War, and prompted both increased investigation (which discovered such spies as Julius and Ethel Rosenberg) and McCarthyism. In the Literary Review of Canada, Margaret Atwood listed the report of the Kellock‚ÄìTaschereau Commission as one of Canada's 100 most important books.Margaret Atwood. 2006. Literary Review of Canada http://reviewcanada.ca/reviews/2006/01/01/the-lrc-100-canada-s-most-important- books/ Many later writers on espionage cite its evidence as the first detailed narratives of how Soviet agents cultivated sympathetic acquaintances so as to turn them into active spies on secret topics. Gordon Lunan, one of the spies most harshly punished (5 years in prison) later published personal memoirs.The Making of a Spy: a Political Odyssey (Montreal: Robert Davies 1995), revised and expanded 2005 as Redhanded: Inside the Spy Ring that Changed the World (Maxville, ON: Optimum Publishing, 2005).

It ran on CBBC's section BBC1 and BBC2 from 6 January 2004, to 30 March 2004. The gameshow featured three children contestants entering a haunted castle in Scotland to assist Professor MacAbre in hunting ghosts before they reach their \\"death day\\" and gain superpowers.http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Spook_Squad The show was filmed in Fyvie Castle. Format Spook Squad follows a repetitive format with each of its episodes. The gameshow's plot involves three children visiting a haunted castle in Scotland to gain a place in the Spook Squad, a league of Ghostbusters-like ghost hunters. They are met by Professor MacAbre (Andrew Pepper), an eccentric and rather cowardly paranormalist, who acts as the gameshow's host and gives instructions to the children when they play the games. Each episode involves the contestants and Professor Rupert MacAbre preventing ghosts who died in the castle from obtaining a valuable item on their death anniversaries, otherwise the ghosts will gain supernatural powers and immortality (e.g. The \\"Devilish Debutante\\" seeks a necklace or \\"The Headless Knight\\" seeks a gauntlet). The antagonist to the contestants is the ghost of Lord MacAbre (Ford Kiernan), Professor MacAbre's villainous ancestor who sets up each game for the contestants. The contestants have until the last stroke of midnight to complete the task. The contestants' goal is to collect \\"ectoplasmic residue\\" of the ghosts in order to gain letters that will eventually spell out the item that the ghost is seeking. The contestants travel to two different rooms around the castle in search of the ectoplasm, but are placed into games by Lord MacAbre. There are at least three different games per episodes, including a memory game in which the contestants must match sound effects to their origins and then play them in a certain order; and a game where they have to play a bowling game of sorts involving knocking down skeletons using large rubber balls and mops to guide the balls. Other games include a maze or throwing hula-hoops over statuettes or memorising the features on different statues and placing them all on another statue. The third game involves a contestant going outside the castle, whether he or she enters the castle's dungeon or the graveyard to complete the third game. However, in the dungeon, they are locked in and must find a key to escape otherwise they remain in the dungeon, unless the other contestants forfeit some of the letters they have gained. In the final game, they enter the room the episode's ghost had died in. Professor MacAbre reveals the letters the contestants have gathered and asks them to spell out the correct item and then must locate it before midnight to win the game. If successful, the ghost will be banished from the castle and the contestants win medals and \\"entry\\" into the Spook Squad, but if they fail then they are haunted by the evil ghost and run out of the castle .

The 2006 St Albans City and District Council election took place on 4 May 2006 to elect members of St Albans District Council in Hertfordshire, England. One third of the council was up for election and the Liberal Democrats gained overall control of the council from no overall control. After the election, the composition of the council was *Liberal Democrats 31 *Conservative 17 *Labour 8 *Independent 2 Campaign Before the election the council was composed of 29 Liberal Democrats, 17 Conservative, 11 Labour and 1 Independent councillors. The Liberal Democrats hoped to win a majority at the election and complained about decisions being delayed by the opposition parties. However the Conservatives were also confident of making gains and said that a hung council with the best councillors from each party making up the cabinet was right for St Albans. Labour meanwhile were hopeful of holding onto their seats, expecting that they would perform better than in recent elections. As well as the 3 main parties on the council, the Green Party also stood candidates in every ward, while targeting Clarence ward as their best chance. Election result The Liberal Democrats regained overall control of the council that they had lost at the 1999 election after making a net gain of 2 seats. They gained 3 seats from Labour and 2 from the Conservatives, but also lost 3 seats in Marshalswick South, Redbourn and Verulam to the Conservatives. The 3 defeats for Labour included one in Sopwell ward, which they lost for what was described as \\"the first time in living memory\\". The results meant that the Liberal Democrats had a majority over the other parties of 4 seats after previously only having half of the councillors before the election, however the Conservatives did win more votes at the election than the Liberal Democrats. Overall turnout at the election was 45.1%. In Wheathampstead ward the election ended in a tie after 3 recounts. The winner in the ward was decided by getting the 2 candidates to pick the longer pencil resulting in the Liberal Democrat Judith Shardlow defeating the Conservative former mayor Keith Stammers. Meanwhile, the Conservative group on the council was reduced, when councillor John Newman, left the party to sit as an independent councillor after having recently being replaced as Conservative group leader on the council by Teresa Heritage.

It helped to train and provide logistic support for the Republic of Korea Army. History Following the end of World War II, the United States and the Soviet union split up the administration of Korea, with the United States taking charge of the southern half. Beginning in January 1946, the U.S. military government in the south began to form a Korean defense force, and 18 lieutenants from the U.S. Army's 40th Infantry Division were tasked with organizing eight Korea Constabulary Regiments (one for each province,), which were to act as a police force.Summers, pg. 161 The Constabulary grew rapidly, from 2,000 men in April 1946 to 50,000 in March 1948. When the ROK declared independence on 15 August 1948, the Constabulary was absorbed into the Republic of Korea Army, and the United States created a Provisional Military Advisory Group (PMAG) to continue the work of training and advising the fledgling South Korean military,Advising Indigenous Forces: American Advisors in Korea, Vietnam, and El Salvador, by Robert D. Ramsey III, Combat Studies Institute Press, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, 2006, page 21 led by Brigadier General William Lynn Roberts (USMA 1913). The 100 American advisors in Korea,Sawyer, p. 35 working under the auspices of the Department of Internal Security (DIS), were reassigned to PMAG at this time, and the unit's roster was expanded.Stoker, p. 88 KMAG Headquarters, Daegu, South Korea circa 1950 On July 1, 1949, PMAG was redesignated the United States Military Advisory Group to the Republic of Korea (KMAG). When North Korean forces invaded South Korea on June 25, 1950, KMAG became the United States Military Advisory Group, Korea, 8668th Army Unit, under the command of the United States Eighth Army. Brigadier General Francis W. Farrell (USMA 1920) took command of the unit on July 25 and had to face high rejection rate within South Korean draftees, when after a month, the Replacement Training Center had rejected 10,000 recruits as medically or physically unfit. On 28 December 1950, it was renamed as the 8202nd Army Unit. KMAG had also short supplies of were tents, radios, ambulances, clothing, food and water, fuel, sandbags, wood planking, compasses, rifle cleaning kits, medical supplies, and above all, ammunition. Farrell also fought with the lack of qualified instructors. New Commanding general of Eighth Army, James Van Fleet, was not fully satisfied with the progress of KMAG and although he thought Farrell had done a wonderful job as KMAG chief, he felt that Farrell was ‚Äúcompletely worn out and needed a change.‚Äù Brigadier General Francis W. Farrell Van Fleet requested highly qualified troop trainer, Brigadier general Cornelius E. Ryan, a former commander of 101st Airborne Division, whom he knew from his previous assignment in the United States. Ryan assumed command on July 7, 1951 with the task was to transform the Republic of Korea Army (ROKA) into a fighting force capable of carrying its weight in United States Eighth Army and make Korean Military Advisory Group responsive to the needs of the Republic of Korea Army. He developed strong relation with his counterparts, generals Lee Chong-chan and Paik Sun-yup and worked together on plans to make a new army. When Ryan arrived in Korea, KMAG had 920 officers and men assigned to it and by September 1951, Ryan supervised 1,308 advisors. He later increased the number of KMAG advisors to the total strength of 1,812 personnel by January 1952. Altogether, 499,751 trainees passed through the KMAG Replacement Training Center system from July 1950 through August 1953. Under his leadership, KMAG transformed into a first-class military training and advisory mission. Under his experienced direction, KMAG then inaugurated a series of training and organizational reforms that laid the basis for a Korean Army capable of fighting the Chinese on more equal terms. Ryan served in Korea until mid-May 1953, when he was succeeded by Brigadier general Gordon B. Rogers. Command Structure Chiefs of the KMAG *BG William L.

The reserve was established on 1 October 1990 following the German Reunification and is under the protection of the UNESCO Man and Biosphere Reserve Programme. It stretches over the German districts of Barnim, Uckermark, M√§rkisch-Oderland and Oberhavel and incorporates an area of . Notable towns are Eberswalde, Joachimsthal and Friedrichswalde. The core area of the reserve is formed by the Schorfheide forest, one of the largest cohesive woodlands in Germany. History From the Early Middle Ages until the period of the Thirty Years' War, the area fell under the responsibility of the cloister of Chorin which led to a cultivation of suitable spaces. Forest clearances took place for the sake of producing weapons for the Prussian army, but the woods were usually afforested. Large parts of the woodland were left untouched as hunting areas for the nobility, which marked the creation of today's wilderness. During the Third Reich, Hermann G√∂ring chose the spot for his country residence Carinhall. After World War II, the forests were again used as an exclusive hunting and leisure area for the East German leaders. The title of a Biosphere Reserve was awarded in 1990 following an initiative of then East German head of state Lothar de Maizi√®re. Nature and biology Carr landscape in the Schorfheide reserve. The Schorfheide was formed during the last ice age. Today it is a cultural landscape composed of extensive woodlands (most of which are dominated by either oaks or pines), a wide range of bodies of standing water like lakes (most notably Werbellinsee, Grimnitzsee and Parsteiner See), ponds and renaturated bogs, as well as heathlands. Some parts of the Schorfheide are left as a wilderness. The reserve is crossed by the river Rag√∂se. The Schorfheide-Chorin Biosphere Reserve is home of many forest- living animals like red deer and wild boars. Of special interest and goal of protection are those animals whose habitats are endangered elsewhere in Germany like beavers, otters, pond tortoises and fire-bellied toads. Due to its water bodies, the area serves as an important breeding and resting ground for birds like white-tailed eagles and cranes.

It is offers centralized cardiac safety and respiratory efficacy services in drug development and also collects, analyzes and distributes electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePRO) in multiple modalities across all phases of clinical research. History ERT, formerly known as Cardio Data Systems, was founded in 1972 and analyzed ambulatory Holter electrocardiograms and conducted its first research study in 1975. By the end of that year the company expanded into the largest U.S. Holter monitoring research provider of evaluating cardiovascular drugs for approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In 1979, the company analyzed 4,500 Holter readings for the National Institutes of Health‚Äôs Beta Blocker Heart Attack Trial. The study resulted in the recommendation to use the drug propranolol for at least three years in patients who have had a recent heart attack and who need to have their heart rate slowed down. In 1987 Cardio Data Systems, Ltd. expanded to the United Kingdom to extend its business services internationally. They based their operations in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire. In 1990, now known as CDSResearch, they initiated a computer analysis for cardiologists to measure changes on a 12-Lead ECG electrocardiogram. The name was changed again in 1993 to CDSResearchWorldwide and moved its headquarters to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where they opened a 45-bed Clinical Research Unit located in center city Philadelphia, which was created for conducting inpatient and outpatient pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and other Phase 1 Studies. In 1997 with the acquisition of DLB systems, Ltd. and a name change to Premier Research Worldwide, the company became publicly held on the NASDAQ National Market System under the symbol PRWW. Two years later, in 1999, PRWW sold its portion of CRO operations and in 2000 eResearch Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: ERT) was formed. In 2007 ERT launched a new product line for electronic patient-reported outcomes, ePRO. Finally 2008 and 2009 marked substantial growth for the company and brought two awards. First, CIO 100 Award of 2008 for their accomplishments in ECG analysis software that allows customers the flexibility needed to configure their ECG Clinical Studies. Second, the European Outsourcing Awards of 2009 Best New Product. In 2008 ERT acquired Biosigna, a Munich-based company, which specialized in biomedical signal processing.

In the Second Schleswig War in 1864, Bronsart von Schellendorff participated in the Battle of Dybb√∏l. He experienced the Austro-Prussian War from the headquarters of the King of Prussia. He was subsequently made a Major. From 1866 to 1869 Bronsart von Schellendorff was on the staff of the 17th Division. In 1869 he was placed in command of a battalion of the 87th Infantry Regiment. At the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 he was Chief of Staff of the IX Army Corps and participated in all battles of this army corps during the war. From 1871 to 1875 he occupied the same post in the XIII Army Corps. In 1875 Bronsart von Schellendorff was appointed commander of the 89th Infantry Brigade, and in 1879 Commander of the 34th Infantry Brigade. In 1880 he became a Major General and in 1881 was transferred as Chief of Staff to the X Army Corps. In 1884 he became a Lieutenant General and at the same time commander of the 17th Division, and in 1888 was made general officer commanding (Kommandierender General) of the III Army Corps and in 1890 that of the X Army Corps. From January 1893 he did not have a fixed assignment, and was appointed Minister of War in October of that year. In this capacity, he defended the army against the criticisms of the Social Democrats, and announced a reform of the military criminal justice procedure as demanded by the Reichstag. Due to disagreements with the Military Cabinet, he resigned on 14 August 1896. Bronsart von Schellendorff died in 1914 at Gut Marienhof in the Amtsbezirk G√ºstrow. He was also the owner of the G√ºstrow properties Gro√ü- and Klein-Tessin.

These behaviours include music listening, performing, composing, reading, writing, and ancillary activities. It also is increasingly concerned with the brain basis for musical aesthetics and musical emotion. Scientists working in this field may have training in cognitive neuroscience, neurology, neuroanatomy, psychology, music theory, computer science, and other relevant fields. The cognitive neuroscience of music represents a significant branch of music psychology, and is distinguished from related fields such as cognitive musicology in its reliance on direct observations of the brain and use of brain imaging techniques like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET).  Elements of music  Pitch Sounds consist of waves of air molecules that vibrate at different frequencies. These waves travel to the basilar membrane in the cochlea of the inner ear. Different frequencies of sound will cause vibrations in different location of the basilar membrane. We are able to hear different pitches because each sound wave with a unique frequency is correlated to a different location along the basilar membrane. This spatial arrangement of sounds and their respective frequencies being processed in the basilar membrane is known as tonotopy. When the hair cells on the basilar membrane move back and forth due to the vibrating sound waves, they release neurotransmitters and cause action potentials to occur down the auditory nerve. The auditory nerve then leads to several layers of synapses at numerous clusters of neurons, or nuclei, in the auditory brainstem. These nuclei are also tonotopically organized, and the process of achieving this tonotopy after the cochlea is not well understood. This tonotopy is in general maintained up to primary auditory cortex in mammals. A widely postulated mechanism for pitch processing in the early central auditory system is the phase-locking and mode-locking of action potentials to frequencies in a stimulus. Phase-locking to stimulus frequencies has been shown in the auditory nerve, the cochlear nucleus, the inferior colliculus, and the auditory thalamus. By phase- and mode-locking in this way, the auditory brainstem is known to preserve a good deal of the temporal and low-passed frequency information from the original sound; this is evident by measuring the auditory brainstem response using EEG. This temporal preservation is one way to argue directly for the temporal theory of pitch perception, and to argue indirectly against the place theory of pitch perception. The primary auditory cortex is one of the main areas associated with superior pitch resolution. The right secondary auditory cortex has finer pitch resolution than the left. Hyde, Peretz and Zatorre (2008) used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in their study to test the involvement of right and left auditory cortical regions in frequency processing of melodic sequences. As well as finding superior pitch resolution in the right secondary auditory cortex, specific areas found to be involved were the planum temporale (PT) in the secondary auditory cortex, and the primary auditory cortex in the medial section of Heschl's gyrus (HG). Many neuroimaging studies have found evidence of the importance of right secondary auditory regions in aspects of musical pitch processing, such as melody. Many of these studies such as one by Patterson, Uppenkamp, Johnsrude and Griffiths (2002) also find evidence of a hierarchy of pitch processing. Patterson et al. (2002) used spectrally matched sounds which produced: no pitch, fixed pitch or melody in an fMRI study and found that all conditions activated HG and PT. Sounds with pitch activated more of these regions than sounds without. When a melody was produced activation spread to the superior temporal gyrus (STG) and planum polare (PP). These results support the existence of a pitch processing hierarchy. =Absolute pitch= Musicians possessing perfect pitch can identify the pitch of musical tones without external reference. Absolute pitch (AP) is defined as the ability to identify the pitch of a musical tone or to produce a musical tone at a given pitch without the use of an external reference pitch. PDF Document Neuroscientific research has not discovered a distinct activation pattern common for possessors of AP. Zatorre, Perry, Beckett, Westbury and Evans (1998) examined the neural foundations of AP using functional and structural brain imaging techniques. Positron emission tomography (PET) was utilized to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) in musicians possessing AP and musicians lacking AP. When presented with musical tones, similar patterns of increased CBF in auditory cortical areas emerged in both groups. AP possessors and non-AP subjects demonstrated similar patterns of left dorsolateral frontal activity when they performed relative pitch judgments. However, in non-AP subjects activation in the right inferior frontal cortex was present whereas AP possessors showed no such activity. This finding suggests that musicians with AP do not need access to working memory devices for such tasks. These findings imply that there is no specific regional activation pattern unique to AP. Rather, the availability of specific processing mechanisms and task demands determine the recruited neural areas.  Melody  Studies suggest that individuals are capable of automatically detecting a difference or anomaly in a melody such as an out of tune pitch which does not fit with their previous music experience. This automatic processing occurs in the secondary auditory cortex. Brattico, Tervaniemi, Naatanen, and Peretz (2006) performed one such study to determine if the detection of tones that do not fit an individual's expectations can occur automatically. They recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) in nonmusicians as they were presented unfamiliar melodies with either an out of tune pitch or an out of key pitch while participants were either distracted from the sounds or attending to the melody. Both conditions revealed an early frontal error- related negativity independent of where attention was directed. This negativity originated in the auditory cortex, more precisely in the supratemporal lobe (which corresponds with the secondary auditory cortex) with greater activity from the right hemisphere. The negativity response was larger for pitch that was out of tune than that which was out of key. Ratings of musical incongruity were higher for out of tune pitch melodies than for out of key pitch. In the focused attention condition, out of key and out of tune pitches produced late parietal positivity. The findings of Brattico et al. (2006) suggest that there is automatic and rapid processing of melodic properties in the secondary auditory cortex. The findings that pitch incongruities were detected automatically, even in processing unfamiliar melodies, suggests that there is an automatic comparison of incoming information with long term knowledge of musical scale properties, such as culturally influenced rules of musical properties (common chord progressions, scale patterns, etc.) and individual expectations of how the melody should proceed. Rhythm The belt and parabelt areas of the right hemisphere are involved in processing rhythm. Rhythm is a strong repeated pattern of movement or sound. When individuals are preparing to tap out a rhythm of regular intervals (1:2 or 1:3) the left frontal cortex, left parietal cortex, and right cerebellum are all activated. With more difficult rhythms such as a 1:2.5, more areas in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum are involved. EEG recordings have also shown a relationship between brain electrical activity and rhythm perception. Snyder and Large (2005) performed a study examining rhythm perception in human subjects, finding that activity in the gamma band (20 ‚Äì 60 Hz) corresponds to the beats in a simple rhythm. Two types of gamma activity were found by Snyder & Large: induced gamma activity, and evoked gamma activity. Evoked gamma activity was found after the onset of each tone in the rhythm; this activity was found to be phase-locked (peaks and troughs were directly related to the exact onset of the tone) and did not appear when a gap (missed beat) was present in the rhythm. Induced gamma activity, which was not found to be phase-locked, was also found to correspond with each beat. However, induced gamma activity did not subside when a gap was present in the rhythm, indicating that induced gamma activity may possibly serve as a sort of internal metronome independent of auditory input. Tonality Tonality describes the relationships between the elements of melody and harmony ‚Äì tones, intervals, chords, and scales. These relationships are often characterized as hierarchical, such that one of the elements dominates or attracts another. They occur both within and between every type of element, creating a rich and time-varying perception between tones and their melodic, harmonic, and chromatic contexts. In one conventional sense, tonality refers to just the major and minor scale types ‚Äì examples of scales whose elements are capable of maintaining a consistent set of functional relationships. The most important functional relationship is that of the tonic note (the first note in a scale) and the tonic chord (the first note in the scale with the third and fifth note) with the rest of the scale. The tonic is the element which tends to assert its dominance and attraction over all others, and it functions as the ultimate point of attraction, rest and resolution for the scale. The right auditory cortex is primarily involved in perceiving pitch, and parts of harmony, melody and rhythm. One study by Petr Janata found that there are tonality-sensitive areas in the medial prefrontal cortex, the cerebellum, the superior temporal sulci of both hemispheres and the superior temporal gyri (which has a skew towards the right hemisphere). Music production and performance Motor control functions Musical performance usually involves at least three elementary motor control functions: timing, sequencing, and spatial organization of motor movements. Accuracy in timing of movements is related to musical rhythm. Rhythm, the pattern of temporal intervals within a musical measure or phrase, in turn creates the perception of stronger and weaker beats. Sequencing and spatial organization relate to the expression of individual notes on a musical instrument. These functions and their neural mechanisms have been investigated separately in many studies, but little is known about their combined interaction in producing a complex musical performance. The study of music requires examining them together. =Timing= Although neural mechanisms involved in timing movement have been studied rigorously over the past 20 years, much remains controversial. The ability to phrase movements in precise time has been accredited to a neural metronome or clock mechanism where time is represented through oscillations or pulses. An opposing view to this metronome mechanism has also been hypothesized stating that it is an emergent property of the kinematics of movement itself. Kinematics is defined as parameters of movement through space without reference to forces (for example, direction, velocity and acceleration). Functional neuroimaging studies, as well as studies of brain- damaged patients, have linked movement timing to several cortical and sub- cortical regions, including the cerebellum, basal ganglia and supplementary motor area (SMA). Specifically the basal ganglia and possibly the SMA have been implicated in interval timing at longer timescales (1 second and above), while the cerebellum may be more important for controlling motor timing at shorter timescales (milliseconds). Furthermore, these results indicate that motor timing is not controlled by a single brain region, but by a network of regions that control specific parameters of movement and that depend on the relevant timescale of the rhythmic sequence. =Sequencing= Motor sequencing has been explored in terms of either the ordering of individual movements, such as finger sequences for key presses, or the coordination of subcomponents of complex multi-joint movements. Implicated in this process are various cortical and sub-cortical regions, including the basal ganglia, the SMA and the pre-SMA, the cerebellum, and the premotor and prefrontal cortices, all involved in the production and learning of motor sequences but without explicit evidence of their specific contributions or interactions amongst one another. In animals, neurophysiological studies have demonstrated an interaction between the frontal cortex and the basal ganglia during the learning of movement sequences. Human neuroimaging studies have also emphasized the contribution of the basal ganglia for well-learned sequences. The cerebellum is arguably important for sequence learning and for the integration of individual movements into unified sequences, while the pre-SMA and SMA have been shown to be involved in organizing or chunking of more complex movement sequences. Chunking, defined as the re-organization or re- grouping of movement sequences into smaller sub-sequences during performance, is thought to facilitate the smooth performance of complex movements and to improve motor memory. Lastly, the premotor cortex has been shown to be involved in tasks that require the production of relatively complex sequences, and it may contribute to motor prediction. =Spatial organization= Few studies of complex motor control have distinguished between sequential and spatial organization, yet expert musical performances demand not only precise sequencing but also spatial organization of movements. Studies in animals and humans have established the involvement of parietal, sensory‚Äìmotor and premotor cortices in the control of movements, when the integration of spatial, sensory and motor information is required. Few studies so far have explicitly examined the role of spatial processing in the context of musical tasks. Auditory-motor interactions =Feedforward and feedback interactions= An auditory‚Äìmotor interaction may be loosely defined as any engagement of or communication between the two systems. Two classes of auditory-motor interaction are \\"feedforward\\" and \\"feedback\\". In feedforward interactions, it is the auditory system that predominately influences the motor output, often in a predictive way. An example is the phenomenon of tapping to the beat, where the listener anticipates the rhythmic accents in a piece of music. Another example is the effect of music on movement disorders: rhythmic auditory stimuli have been shown to improve walking ability in Parkinson's disease and stroke patients. Feedback interactions are particularly relevant in playing an instrument such as a violin, or in singing, where pitch is variable and must be continuously controlled. If auditory feedback is blocked, musicians can still execute well-rehearsed pieces, but expressive aspects of performance are affected. When auditory feedback is experimentally manipulated by delays or distortions, motor performance is significantly altered: asynchronous feedback disrupts the timing of events, whereas alteration of pitch information disrupts the selection of appropriate actions, but not their timing. This suggests that disruptions occur because both actions and percepts depend on a single underlying mental representation. =Models of auditory‚Äìmotor interactions= Several models of auditory‚Äìmotor interactions have been advanced. The model of Hickok and Poeppel, which is specific for speech processing, proposes that a ventral auditory stream maps sounds onto meaning, whereas a dorsal stream maps sounds onto articulatory representations. They and othersScott, S. K. & Johnsrude, I. S. \\"The neuroanatomical and functional organization of speech perception. Trends Neurosci. 26, 100‚Äì107 (2003) suggest that posterior auditory regions at the parieto-temporal boundary are crucial parts of the auditory‚Äìmotor interface, mapping auditory representations onto motor representations of speech, and onto melodies. =Mirror/echo neurons and auditory‚Äìmotor interactions= The mirror neuron system has an important role in neural models of sensory‚Äìmotor integration. There is considerable evidence that neurons respond to both actions and the accumulated observation of actions. A system proposed to explain this understanding of actions is that visual representations of actions are mapped onto our own motor system. Some mirror neurons are activated both by the observation of goal-directed actions, and by the associated sounds produced during the action. This suggests that the auditory modality can access the motor system. While these auditory‚Äìmotor interactions have mainly been studied for speech processes, and have focused on Broca's area and the vPMC, as of 2011, experiments have begun to shed light on how these interactions are needed for musical performance. Results point to a broader involvement of the dPMC and other motor areas. Music and language Certain aspects of language and melody have been shown to be processed in near identical functional brain areas. Brown, Martinez and Parsons (2006) examined the neurological structural similarities between music and language. Utilizing positron emission tomography (PET), the findings showed that both linguistic and melodic phrases produced activation in almost identical functional brain areas. These areas included the primary motor cortex, supplementary motor area, Broca's area, anterior insula, primary and secondary auditory cortices, temporal pole, basal ganglia, ventral thalamus and posterior cerebellum. Differences were found in lateralization tendencies as language tasks favoured the left hemisphere, but the majority of activations were bilateral which produced significant overlap across modalities. Syntactical information mechanisms in both music and language have been shown to be processed similarly in the brain. Jentschke, Koelsch, Sallat and Friederici (2008) conducted a study investigating the processing of music in children with specific language impairments (SLI). Children with typical language development (TLD) showed ERP patterns different from those of children with SLI, which reflected their challenges in processing music- syntactic regularities. Strong correlations between the ERAN (Early Right Anterior Negativity‚Äîa specific ERP measure) amplitude and linguistic and musical abilities provide additional evidence for the relationship of syntactical processing in music and language. However, production of melody and production of speech may be subserved by different neural networks. Stewart, Walsh, Frith and Rothwell (2001) studied the differences between speech production and song production using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Stewart et al. found that TMS applied to the left frontal lobe disturbs speech but not melody supporting the idea that they are subserved by different areas of the brain. The authors suggest that a reason for the difference is that speech generation can be localized well but the underlying mechanisms of melodic production cannot. Alternatively, it was also suggested that speech production may be less robust than melodic production and thus more susceptible to interference. Language processing is a function more of the left side of the brain than the right side, particularly Broca's area and Wernicke's area, though the roles played by the two sides of the brain in processing different aspects of language are still unclear. Music is also processed by both the left and the right sides of the brain. Recent evidence further suggest shared processing between language and music at the conceptual level. It has also been found that, among music conservatory students, the prevalence of absolute pitch is much higher for speakers of tone language, even controlling for ethnic background, showing that language influences how musical tones are perceived.  Musician vs. non-musician processing  Professional pianists show less cortical activation for complex finger movement tasks due to structural differences in the brain.  Differences  Brain structure within musicians and non-musicians is distinctly different. Gaser and Schlaug (2003) compared brain structures of professional musicians with non-musicians and discovered gray matter volume differences in motor, auditory and visual-spatial brain regions. Specifically, positive correlations were discovered between musician status (professional, amateur and non- musician) and gray matter volume in the primary motor and somatosensory areas, premotor areas, anterior superior parietal areas and in the inferior temporal gyrus bilaterally. This strong association between musician status and gray matter differences supports the notion that musicians' brains show use- dependent structural changes. Due to the distinct differences in several brain regions, it is unlikely that these differences are innate but rather due to the long-term acquisition and repetitive rehearsal of musical skills. Brains of musicians also show functional differences from those of non-musicians. Krings, Topper, Foltys, Erberich, Sparing, Willmes and Thron (2000) utilized fMRI to study brain area involvement of professional pianists and a control group while performing complex finger movements. Krings et al. found that the professional piano players showed lower levels of cortical activation in motor areas of the brain. It was concluded that a lesser amount of neurons needed to be activated for the piano players due to long-term motor practice which results in the different cortical activation patterns. Koeneke, Lutz, Wustenberg and Jancke (2004) reported similar findings in keyboard players. Skilled keyboard players and a control group performed complex tasks involving unimanual and bimanual finger movements. During task conditions, strong hemodynamic responses in the cerebellum were shown by both non-musicians and keyboard players, but non-musicians showed the stronger response. This finding indicates that different cortical activation patterns emerge from long-term motor practice. This evidence supports previous data showing that musicians require fewer neurons to perform the same movements. Musicians have been shown to have significantly more developed left planum temporales, and have also shown to have a greater word memory.(Chan et al.) Chan's study controlled for age, grade point average and years of education and found that when given a 16 word memory test, the musicians averaged one to two more words above their non musical counterparts.  Similarities  Studies have shown that the human brain has an implicit musical ability. Koelsch, Gunter, Friederici and Schoger (2000) investigated the influence of preceding musical context, task relevance of unexpected chords and the degree of probability of violation on music processing in both musicians and non-musicians. Findings showed that the human brain unintentionally extrapolates expectations about impending auditory input. Even in non-musicians, the extrapolated expectations are consistent with music theory. The ability to process information musically supports the idea of an implicit musical ability in the human brain. In a follow-up study, Koelsch, Schroger, and Gunter (2002) investigated whether ERAN and N5 could be evoked preattentively in non-musicians. Findings showed that both ERAN and N5 can be elicited even in a situation where the musical stimulus is ignored by the listener indicating that there is a highly differentiated preattentive musicality in the human brain.  Gender differences  Minor neurological differences regarding hemispheric processing exist between brains of males and females. Koelsch, Maess, Grossmann and Friederici (2003) investigated music processing through EEG and ERPs and discovered gender differences. Findings showed that females process music information bilaterally and males process music with a right-hemispheric predominance. However, the early negativity of males was also present over the left hemisphere. This indicates that males do not exclusively utilize the right hemisphere for musical information processing. In a follow-up study, Koelsch, Grossman, Gunter, Hahne, Schroger and Friederici (2003) found that boys show lateralization of the early anterior negativity in the left hemisphere but found a bilateral effect in girls. This indicates a developmental effect as early negativity is lateralized in the right hemisphere in men and in the left hemisphere in boys.  Handedness differences  It has been found that subjects who are lefthanded, particularly those who are also ambidextrous, perform better than righthanders on short term memory for the pitch. It was hypothesized that this handedness advantage is due to the fact that lefthanders have more duplication of storage in the two hemispheres than do righthanders. Other work has shown that there are pronounced differences between righthanders and lefthanders (on a statistical basis) in how musical patterns are perceived, when sounds come from different regions of space. This has been found, for example, in the Octave illusion and the Scale illusion. Musical imagery Musical imagery refers to the experience of replaying music by imagining it inside the head. Musicians show a superior ability for musical imagery due to intense musical training. Herholz, Lappe, Knief and Pantev (2008) investigated the differences in neural processing of a musical imagery task in musicians and non-musicians. Utilizing magnetoencephalography (MEG), Herholz et al. examined differences in the processing of a musical imagery task with familiar melodies in musicians and non-musicians. Specifically, the study examined whether the mismatch negativity (MMN) can be based solely on imagery of sounds. The task involved participants listening to the beginning of a melody, continuation of the melody in his/her head and finally hearing a correct/incorrect tone as further continuation of the melody. The imagery of these melodies was strong enough to obtain an early preattentive brain response to unanticipated violations of the imagined melodies in the musicians. These results indicate similar neural correlates are relied upon for trained musicians imagery and perception. Additionally, the findings suggest that modification of the imagery mismatch negativity (iMMN) through intense musical training results in achievement of a superior ability for imagery and preattentive processing of music. Perceptual musical processes and musical imagery may share a neural substrate in the brain. A PET study conducted by Zatorre, Halpern, Perry, Meyer and Evans (1996) investigated cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes related to auditory imagery and perceptual tasks. These tasks examined the involvement of particular anatomical regions as well as functional commonalities between perceptual processes and imagery. Similar patterns of CBF changes provided evidence supporting the notion that imagery processes share a substantial neural substrate with related perceptual processes. Bilateral neural activity in the secondary auditory cortex was associated with both perceiving and imagining songs. This implies that within the secondary auditory cortex, processes underlie the phenomenological impression of imagined sounds. The supplementary motor area (SMA) was active in both imagery and perceptual tasks suggesting covert vocalization as an element of musical imagery. CBF increases in the inferior frontal polar cortex and right thalamus suggest that these regions may be related to retrieval and/or generation of auditory information from memory.  Emotion  Music is able to create an incredibly pleasurable experience that can be described as \\"chills\\". Blood and Zatorre (2001) used PET to measure changes in cerebral blood flow while participants listened to music that they knew to give them the \\"chills\\" or any sort of intensely pleasant emotional response. They found that as these chills increase, many changes in cerebral blood flow are seen in brain regions such as the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, ventral striatum, midbrain, and the ventral medial prefrontal cortex. Many of these areas appear to be linked to reward, motivation, emotion, and arousal, and are also activated in other pleasurable situations. The resulting pleasure responses enable the release dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin. Nucleus accumbens (a part of striatum) is involved in both music related emotions, as well as rhythmic timing. According to the National Institute of Health, children and adults who are suffering from emotional trauma have been able to benefit from the use of music in a variety of ways. The use of music has been essential in helping children who struggle with focus, anxiety, and cognitive function by using music in therapeutic way. Music therapy has also helped children cope with autism, pediatric cancer, and pain from treatments. Emotions induced by music activate similar frontal brain regions compared to emotions elicited by other stimuli. Schmidt and Trainor (2001) discovered that valence (i.e. positive vs. negative) of musical segments was distinguished by patterns of frontal EEG activity. Joyful and happy musical segments were associated with increases in left frontal EEG activity whereas fearful and sad musical segments were associated with increases in right frontal EEG activity. Additionally, the intensity of emotions was differentiated by the pattern of overall frontal EEG activity. Overall frontal region activity increased as affective musical stimuli became more intense. When unpleasant melodies are played, the posterior cingulate cortex activates, which indicates a sense of conflict or emotional pain. The right hemisphere has also been found to be correlated with emotion, which can also activate areas in the cingulate in times of emotional pain, specifically social rejection (Eisenberger). This evidence, along with observations, has led many musical theorists, philosophers and neuroscientists to link emotion with tonality. This seems almost obvious because the tones in music seem like a characterization of the tones in human speech, which indicate emotional content. The vowels in the phonemes of a song are elongated for a dramatic effect, and it seems as though musical tones are simply exaggerations of the normal verbal tonality.  Memory   Neuropsychology of musical memory  Musical memory involves both explicit and implicit memory systems. Explicit musical memory is further differentiated between episodic (where, when and what of the musical experience) and semantic (memory for music knowledge including facts and emotional concepts). Implicit memory centers on the 'how' of music and involves automatic processes such as procedural memory and motor skill learning ‚Äì in other words skills critical for playing an instrument. Samson and Baird (2009) found that the ability of musicians with Alzheimer's Disease to play an instrument (implicit procedural memory) may be preserved.  Neural correlates of musical memory  A PET study looking into the neural correlates of musical semantic and episodic memory found distinct activation patterns. Semantic musical memory involves the sense of familiarity of songs. The semantic memory for music condition resulted in bilateral activation in the medial and orbital frontal cortex, as well as activation in the left angular gyrus and the left anterior region of the middle temporal gyri. These patterns support the functional asymmetry favouring the left hemisphere for semantic memory. Left anterior temporal and inferior frontal regions that were activated in the musical semantic memory task produced activation peaks specifically during the presentation of musical material, suggestion that these regions are somewhat functionally specialized for musical semantic representations. Episodic memory of musical information involves the ability to recall the former context associated with a musical excerpt. In the condition invoking episodic memory for music, activations were found bilaterally in the middle and superior frontal gyri and precuneus, with activation predominant in the right hemisphere. Other studies have found the precuneus to become activated in successful episodic recall. As it was activated in the familiar memory condition of episodic memory, this activation may be explained by the successful recall of the melody. When it comes to memory for pitch, there appears to be a dynamic and distributed brain network subserves pitch memory processes. Gaab, Gaser, Zaehle, Jancke and Schlaug (2003) examined the functional anatomy of pitch memory using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). An analysis of performance scores in a pitch memory task resulted in a significant correlation between good task performance and the supramarginal gyrus (SMG) as well as the dorsolateral cerebellum. Findings indicate that the dorsolateral cerebellum may act as a pitch discrimination processor and the SMG may act as a short-term pitch information storage site. The left hemisphere was found to be more prominent in the pitch memory task than the right hemispheric regions.  Therapeutic effects of music on memory  Musical training has been shown to aid memory. Altenmuller et al. studied the difference between active and passive musical instruction and found both that over a longer (but not short) period of time, the actively taught students retained much more information than the passively taught students. The actively taught students were also found to have greater cerebral cortex activation. The passively taught students weren't wasting their time; they, along with the active group, displayed greater left hemisphere activity, which is typical in trained musicians. Research suggests we listen to the same songs repeatedly because of musical nostalgia. One major study, published in the journal Memory & Cognition, found that music enables the mind to evoke memories of the past. Attention  Treder et al. identified neural correlates of attention when listening to simplified polyphonic music patterns. In a musical oddball experiment, they had participants shift selective attention to one out of three different instruments in music audio clips, with each instrument occasionally playing one or several notes deviating from an otherwise repetitive pattern. Contrasting attended versus unattended instruments, ERP analysis shows subject- and instrument-specific responses including P300 and early auditory components. The attended instrument could be classified offline with high accuracy. This indicates that attention paid to a particular instrument in polyphonic music can be inferred from ongoing EEG, a finding that is potentially relevant for building more ergonomic music-listing based brain- computer interfaces. Development Musical four-year-olds have been found to have one greater left hemisphere intrahemispheric coherence. Musicians have been found to have more developed anterior portions of the corpus callosum in a study by Cowell et al. in 1992. This was confirmed by a study by Schlaug et al. in 1995 that found that classical musicians between the ages of 21 and 36 have significantly greater anterior corpora callosa than the non-musical control. Schlaug also found that there was a strong correlation of musical exposure before the age of seven, and a great increase in the size of the corpus callosum. These fibers join together the left and right hemispheres and indicate an increased relaying between both sides of the brain. This suggests the merging between the spatial- emotiono-tonal processing of the right brain and the linguistical processing of the left brain. This large relaying across many different areas of the brain might contribute to music's ability to aid in memory function.  Impairment   Focal hand dystonia  Focal hand dystonia is a task-related movement disorder associated with occupational activities that require repetitive hand movements. Focal hand dystonia is associated with abnormal processing in the premotor and primary sensorimotor cortices. An fMRI study examined five guitarists with focal hand dystonia. The study reproduced task-specific hand dystonia by having guitarists use a real guitar neck inside the scanner as well as performing a guitar exercise to trigger abnormal hand movement. The dystonic guitarists showed significantly more activation of the contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex as well as a bilateral underactivation of premotor areas. This activation pattern represents abnormal recruitment of the cortical areas involved in motor control. Even in professional musicians, widespread bilateral cortical region involvement is necessary to produce complex hand movements such as scales and arpeggios. The abnormal shift from premotor to primary sensorimotor activation directly correlates with guitar-induced hand dystonia.  Music agnosia  Music agnosia, an auditory agnosia, is a syndrome of selective impairment in music recognition. Three cases of music agnosia are examined by Dalla Bella and Peretz (1999); C.N., G.L., and I.R.. All three of these patients suffered bilateral damage to the auditory cortex which resulted in musical difficulties while speech understanding remained intact. Their impairment is specific to the recognition of once familiar melodies. They are spared in recognizing environmental sounds and in recognizing lyrics. Peretz (1996) has studied C.N.'s music agnosia further and reports an initial impairment of pitch processing and spared temporal processing. C.N. later recovered in pitch processing abilities but remained impaired in tune recognition and familiarity judgments. Musical agnosias may be categorized based on the process which is impaired in the individual. Apperceptive music agnosia involves an impairment at the level of perceptual analysis involving an inability to encode musical information correctly. Associative music agnosia reflects an impaired representational system which disrupts music recognition. Many of the cases of music agnosia have resulted from surgery involving the middle cerebral artery. Patient studies have surmounted a large amount of evidence demonstrating that the left side of the brain is more suitable for holding long-term memory representations of music and that the right side is important for controlling access to these representations. Associative music agnosias tend to be produced by damage to the left hemisphere, while apperceptive music agnosia reflects damage to the right hemisphere.  Congenital amusia  Congenital amusia, otherwise known as tone deafness, is a term for lifelong musical problems which are not attributable to mental retardation, lack of exposure to music or deafness, or brain damage after birth. Amusic brains have been found in fMRI studies to have less white matter and thicker cortex than controls in the right inferior frontal cortex. These differences suggest abnormal neuronal development in the auditory cortex and inferior frontal gyrus, two areas which are important in musical-pitch processing. Studies on those with amusia suggest different processes are involved in speech tonality and musical tonality. Congenital amusics lack the ability to distinguish between pitches and so are for example unmoved by dissonance and playing the wrong key on a piano. They also cannot be taught to remember a melody or to recite a song; however, they are still capable of hearing the intonation of speech, for example, distinguishing between \\"You speak French\\" and \\"You speak French?\\" when spoken.  Amygdala damage  Damage to the amygdala may impair recognition of scary music. Damage to the amygdala has selective emotional impairments on musical recognition. Gosselin, Peretz, Johnsen and Adolphs (2007) studied S.M., a patient with bilateral damage of the amygdala with the rest of the temporal lobe undamaged and found that S.M. was impaired in recognition of scary and sad music. S.M.'s perception of happy music was normal, as was her ability to use cues such as tempo to distinguish between happy and sad music. It appears that damage specific to the amygdala can selectively impair recognition of scary music.  Selective deficit in music reading  Specific musical impairments may result from brain damage leaving other musical abilities intact. Cappelletti, Waley-Cohen, Butterworth and Kopelman (2000) studied a single case study of patient P.K.C., a professional musician who sustained damage to the left posterior temporal lobe as well as a small right occipitotemporal lesion. After sustaining damage to these regions, P.K.C. was selectively impaired in the areas of reading, writing and understanding musical notation but maintained other musical skills. The ability to read aloud letters, words, numbers and symbols (including musical ones) was retained. However, P.K.C. was unable to read aloud musical notes on the staff regardless of whether the task involved naming with the conventional letter or by singing or playing. Yet despite this specific deficit, P.K.C. retained the ability to remember and play familiar and new melodies.  Auditory arrhythmia  Arrhythmia in the auditory modality is defined as a disturbance of rhythmic sense; and includes deficits such as the inability to rhythmically perform music, the inability to keep time to music and the inability to discriminate between or reproduce rhythmic patterns. A study investigating the elements of rhythmic function examined Patient H.J., who acquired arrhythmia after sustaining a right temporoparietal infarct. Damage to this region impaired H.J.'s central timing system which is essentially the basis of his global rhythmic impairment. H.J. was unable to generate steady pulses in a tapping task. These findings suggest that keeping a musical beat relies on functioning in the right temporal auditory cortex.

His father came to the United States from County Kerry in Ireland. He received his early education at West Springfield public schools and at Cathedral High School. He studied at Mount St. Mary's College in Emmitsburg, Maryland, from where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1930. He was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Thomas Michael O'Leary on May 26, 1934, for the Diocese of Raleigh, North Carolina. His first assignments were at Basilica Shrine of St. Mary in Wilmington and at St. Edward Church in High Point. He then served as pastor of St. Therese Church in Wrightsville Beach, Immaculate Conception Church in Wilmington (1938‚Äì1942), and at St. Leo the Great Church in Winston- Salem (1942‚Äì1955). He earned a Master of Social Work degree from the University of North Carolina in 1949, and was named a Domestic Prelate in 1954. In 1955, he became the first pastor of St. Ann Church in Charlotte. He was later made superintendent of Raleigh's Catholic orphanage and pastor of Our Lady of Grace Church in Greensboro. On November 30, 1971, Begley was appointed the first Bishop of the newly erected Diocese of Charlotte by Pope Paul VI. He received his episcopal consecration on January 12, 1972 from Archbishop Luigi Raimondi, with Bishops Vincent Stanislaus Waters and George Edward Lynch serving as co-consecrators. He selected as his motto: \\"Diligimus Fratres\\" (\\"We Have Loved the Brethren\\"). In addition to his duties as a diocesan bishop, he also served as chairman of the Catholic Committee on Appalachia. In this capacity, he led 26 other bishops from 13 states in issuing a joint pastoral letter \\"This Land is Home to Me\\" on the state of the powerless in the region. A supporter of capital punishment, Begley endorsed the 1984 execution of Velma Barfield, noting, \\"The state has a right to decide on the death penalty and this is one instance when they chose that right.\\" Upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 75, Begley submitted his letter of resignation to Pope John Paul II in March 1984. His resignation was accepted on May 29, 1984, and was succeeded by John Francis Donoghue. Begley died at Maryfield Nursing Home in High Point, aged 92.

History In November 1873, four Sisters of Charity from the House of Providence in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, (today's Sisters of Providence of Saint Vincent de Paul), came to Holyoke in Western Massachusetts to care for the sick poor, most of whom were immigrants laboring in the city's paper mills. Holyoke was a young, rapidly growing industrial city with cotton, satin and thread mills. These employed hundreds of immigrants, especially those from Ireland and Scotland. A great dam was built across the Connecticut at Holyoke. Hundreds of laborers were employed in its construction. The immigrants and mill employees were lodged in company houses, badly constructed, unsanitary and overcrowded. Disease, especially typhoid fever, was rampant. Since the city had neither hospital nor an almshouse, during illness these poor people received little or no care. There were no homes for the aged or infirm, or an orphanage for homeless children. Rev. Patrick J. Harkins was pastor of St. Jerome's Church, the only Catholic Church in the city. Harkins was aware of the needs of his poor parishioners and sought their fulfillment. In September 1873 two Sisters of Charity of the House of Providence arrived from their Mother House in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. The two, Sister Mary de Chantal and Sister Mary Elizabeth were on a begging trip and seeking his permission to solicit funds from his parish for their poor back home. Granting their petition, Harkins required, that in return, they petition their superiors in Kingston to establish a mission in Holyoke to meet the charitable needs of his parish. The sisters‚Äô Reverend Mother Mary John and Mother Mary Edward, first assistant, visited Holyoke on September 23, 1873. They accepted Holyoke as their first mission. On November 7, 1873, four sisters arrived to establish the Holyoke mission, settling in their first House of Providence, located on the other side of the Connecticut River in South Hadley Falls. Within one week, Sisters Mary Edward, Mary Mount Carmel, Mary of the Cross, and Mary Patrick welcomed their first orphan, 11-year old Edward Reilly. It was not long after that before the city almoner was sending the city's needy and the infirm to the sisters for care and shelter. Soon their house was filled to capacity and only the very sick and friendless could be admitted. The work of the Sisters of Providence, as all in Holyoke called them, rapidly developed. Soon they were not only caring for the orphaned, the aged, and the infirm at the House of Providence, but for the sick poor in their homes where the sisters spent nights with the dying and preparing the dead for burial. To help support themselves and their ministries, the sisters made and sold altar breads, church linens, vestments and burial robes. This last work was a major source of income for the House of Providence until around 1920. In the summer of 1875 Father Harkins sent a request to Kingston for the Sisters to take charge of the Boys School at St. Jerome's Institute. Teaching was not one of the works for which the sisters‚Äô Congregation had been founded, but not finding it incompatible with their Rule, and wishing to cooperate with the pastor accepted this new work on August 12, 1875. Sister Mary of Providence, Sister Mary Berchmans and four novices arrived from Kingston to begin the new teaching ministry. As no convent had been provided for the sisters teaching in the school, they resided at the House of Providence and frequently helped care for the orphans, aged and infirm in their free time from school, as well as relieving on night duty or spending their nights with the dying. With true missionary spirit, these pioneer sisters generously and courageously fulfilled their vocation as servants of the poor. By 1890 the Rev. Dr. Thomas D. Beaven, acting for the Right Rev. Patrick J. O‚ÄôReilly, Bishop of Springfield Diocese of which Holyoke is a part, petitioned Rome for the sisters in Holyoke to become a new diocesan Congregation, separate from the Mother House in Kingston. On the day of Bishop O‚ÄôReilly's death, May 28, 1892 notice arrived that Rome had granted that permission, and on August 12 Father Beaven was appointed to succeed as bishop. Following his predecessor's plan, sisters who wished were permitted to remain members of the Kingston Community, and on August 13, 1892, fourteen of their number bade farewell to their companions in Holyoke and returned to Kingston. The 30 remaining sisters became the nucleus for the new diocesan Community. And, on August 17, 1892 a provisional government was established with Mother Mary of Providence (in secular life Catherine Horan), as its first major superior. The sisters‚Äô new Community was incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth as the Sisters of Providence, Holyoke, Massachusetts. Their charter, dated December 17, 1892, was granted for ‚Äúthe establishment and maintaining of the school for the education of children; establishing and maintaining a hospital for the cure of the sick; assisting the poor and destitute people; and teaching and fitting young women for the Order of the Sisters of Providence and maintaining the same.‚Äù In the next 15 years, the sisters, under the able leadership of Mother Mary of Providence established 20 works of charity. Mother Mary served as teacher, principal, nurse, administrator and religious leader. By her death in 1943, the Sisters of Providence had made sharp inroads into alleviating the social needs of Western Massachusetts. In their various missions, the works of the Community were continuing to flourish throughout the Springfield Diocese, which at that time include Worcester in central Massachusetts. The Sisters ministries included several hospitals and nursing schools, an orphanage, nursing homes, a residence for working girls and a home for unwed mothers. Many others of their ministries also aided the poor and needy. In 1950, the diocese was divided into two diocese: the newly established Worcester Diocese was headed by Bishop John Wright, and the Springfield Diocese by Bishop Christopher J. Weldon. The need to rebuild many of the institutions operated by the Sisters of Providence was a major concern. Some of the buildings were more than 50 years old, while others needed expansion or modernization. In the Springfield Diocese, Bishop Weldon raised funds to add a new wing to Farren Memorial Hospital in Montague City, and to rebuild Providence Hospital in Holyoke. Funds were also raised to replace the original Brightside buildings in Holyoke with Our Lady of Providence Children's Center in West Springfield, the Guild of the Holy Child in Westfield moved into its new building, and in Worcester, there was a dedication for a new St. Vincent Hospital. During these same years, the Community took steps to provide the advanced educations the Sisters needed in order to assume significant roles within these modern, sophisticated health and human service agencies. A House of Studies was opened in the Boston area for the many sisters who began to pursue professional studies. Many of the newer members of the Community were sent to the House of Studies or to Marillac College, a sister formation college in St. Louise, Missouri, where they obtained college degrees. Today, the sisters legacy is visible in the Sisters of Providence Health System, a member of Trinity Health-New England, whose parent organization Trinity Health is the second largest Catholic health System in the U. S. In addition, the sisters sponsor Genesis Spiritual Life Center, Providence Ministries for the Needy, Providence Place at Ingleside, and Mary's Meadow at Providence Place. Currently they are working to further develop the Hillside at Providence as a ministry site for elder health and affordable housing services.

The Sisters use the postnominal initials of S.S.A. History Foundation The congregation was founded in Turin in 1834 by Carlo Tancredi Falletti (1782 - 1838) and the Servant of God Juliette (Giulia) Colbert, T.O.S.F. (1785 - 1864), the Marchese and Marchioness of Barolo. The childless couple had opened their own palace to the children of the streets of the city, and were seeking to provide for their education. The volunteers they had recruited to help with this mission agreed to embrace the consecrated life. Other women joined the congregation and they began to serve in various towns and villages throughout the Piedmont region and then elsewhere in Italy. The congregation expanded to such a degree that they received the decree of praise from the Holy See, establishing them as a congregation of Pontifical Right, in 1846. Expansion The congregation further developed under the leadership of Mother Mary Henrietta Dominici, S.S.A, who was elected as the Superior General of the congregation in 1861 and served in that office until 1894. Under her inspiration, the Sisters embraced the concept of worldwide service, and in 1871 the first Sisters of St. Ann were sent as missionaries to India. Their first house was in Secunderabad in Andhra Pradesh, from which they began to expand to other parts of India. That region now has the largest group of communities of the Sisters of St. Ann. Dominici was beatified by Pope Paul VI in 1978. The Sisters began to serve in Switzerland in 1920, where they helped immigrants to that country, mostly Italians. In 1952 they established a presence in the United States. In the 1960s, in answer to an appeal by Pope John XXIII, they expanded to serve in various other countries. They now serve in Albania, Argentina, Brazil, Cameroon, Mexico, Peru, the Philippines and the United Kingdom.

History During the French Revolution religious practice was banned, churches secularised, seminaries closed, and religious executed. Jacques Fran√ßois Dujari√© was ordained in secret on 26 December 1795, and ministered as an \\"underground priest\\" in Ruill√© and surrounding area. Although the Concordat of 1801 lifted prohibitions, the effect of the Revolution on French Catholicism and education was severe. In January 1803 Fr.Dujari√© was named parish priest of Ruill√©.\\"Our Origins\\", Sisters of Providence of Ruill√©-sur-Loir Three miles from the village, there were scattered farm houses where families in need of care. In 1806 Abbe Dujarie was able to recruit two laywomen and had a small house built for them, \\"The Little Providence\\". They set up a school to teach the young children, and a dispensary to give basic medical assistance to the poor people of the neighbourhood. By 1808, there were a dozen members whose work had spread to neighboring parishes. Mother Marie-Madeleine du Rosco√§t In 1820 Zoe du Rosc√∂at (Mother Marie-Madeleine) from Pl√©h√©del, in Brittany was chosen as first Superior General. Upon the death of Mother Marie-Madeleine in 1820, Perrine Aim√©e Lecor (Mother Marie) from the Island of Brehat in Brittany was named as her successor. Under her leadership numerous communities were opened in France to serve the poor, the children and the sick. By 1840 there were more than 40 houses in France. That year Theodore Guerin and several other Sisters of Providence went to Indiana in the United States, where they became the autonomous congregation of the Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the- Woods. Towards the end of the 19th Century the French State secularised the schools, and religious were forbidden to teach so groups of Sisters of Providence moved into England, Belgium and Holland where they set up schools.\\"The Sisters of Providence\\", St Hugh's Roman Catholic Church, Lincoln In 1901 the Sisters of Providence were invited by the parish priest of Woodhall Spa, Fr Goddard, a Belgian, to start a house in his parish. The sisters established St. Joseph's School in Lincoln and staffed it from 1911 to 1983. St. Joseph's later merged with the Lincoln Cathedral School and Stonefield House to form the Minster School.

This narrow coastal area north of the city of Ventura and south of the Santa Barbara County line is commonly referred to as The Rincon. The automobile route along this portion of coastline opened up in 1913 as the Rincon Causeway or the Rincon Sea Level Road as the first driveable coastal route for motorists traveling between San Francisco and Los Angeles, California. Stagecoaches were delayed by high tides, storms, mud or rock slides before an alternate route was established in 1878 over the inland Casitas Pass that was accessed by traveling through the narrow Ventura River Valley towards Ojai. The access road alongside the railroad bed, that cut through the area in 1886, provided the basis for building the Rincon Sea Level Road. History As the automobile age began, motorists had to follow the Ventura River Valley towards Nordhoff to the road over Casitas Pass. Civic boosters were eager to open the more direct coastal route. The moment came with the construction of the Southern Pacific Railroad's Coast Line. The construction of the railroad had provided an unimproved road flanked by rip-rap but it was often flooded in several sections from the ocean waves. Rock outcroppings have always made travel difficult along this dramatic meeting of the Santa Ynez Mountains with the Pacific Ocean. Map of automobile road from Los Angeles to San Francisco via coast route shows Rincon Road. Historical travel by foot or horseback along the small alluvial fan beaches and coastal bluffs had to wait for the low tide due to the rock outcroppings. A safer but longer and steeper route was over Casitas Pass and is the more likely route used to travel between Mission San Buenaventura and Mission Santa Barbara than the El Camino Real as designated with commemorative bell markers. A stagecoach route created around 1861 over the Casitas Pass was still used for stagecoach travel to the Santa Barbara area after the opening of a tunnel through the San Fernando Pass in 1876 which completed the inland railroad route and provided an alternate means of travel to northern California.Redmon, Michael (November 21, 2011) \\"Rincon Point Road \\" Santa Barbara Independent Civic boosters started raising funds locally to pave the road and build wooden causeways where needed.HISTORIC RESOURCES GROUP.

Knowles currently tours as a solo artist, but is formerly of the blues-rock band Back Door Slam, as well as working under the name Davy Knowles and Back Door Slam for a short period of time. With Back Door Slam, he played lead guitar and sang on their debut album, Roll Away. After a split-up with bassist Adam Jones and drummer Ross Doyle, Knowles released the first and only album under the name Davy Knowles and Back Door Slam, Coming Up for Air, on 19 May 2009. Knowles drew his musical influences from blues musicians that he grew up listening to such as Dire Straits, Peter Green, and Eric Clapton's Cream. Due to his home country's proximity to Ireland, Knowles has stated that his music also is influenced by the Celtic genre, which is noted to be present in the song \\"Roll Away\\". In April 2009, Knowles toured with British guitarist Jeff Beck on his American tour, where he was the opening act. He toured with Joe Satriani and Chickenfoot in the United States through December 2009. Davy Knowles toured with The Rhythm Devils in 2010. Knowles released his first solo album, The Outsider, in 2014. He released his second solo album, Three Miles From Avalon, in 2016. He is currently based out of Chicago, Illinois and continues to tour in the United States regularly. Early life Knowles was born in Port St Mary, Isle of Man. At age 11, Knowles first became interested in music when he heard Dire Straits's \\"Sultans of Swing\\" during a car ride with his father. Promptly, he took his father's guitar and learned how to play the song by ear. As Knowles grew older, he was influenced by other artists like Dire Straits that he found in his father's music collection such as Rory Gallagher, Eric Clapton, and Robert Johnson. As a child, Knowles briefly took guitar lessons, but did not prefer the traditional way of learning how to play. After he stopped taking lessons he taught himself. Knowles attended Castle Rushen High School in Castletown, Isle of Man, where he met future bandmates Brian Garvey, Ross Doyle, Adam Jones, and Jamie Armstrong. Musical career Back Door Slam Back Door Slam is the name of the blues rock band started by Davy Knowles on the Isle of Man in 2003/4. The band got its name from a Robert Cray song of the same name. Originally a four piece, with Castle Rushen High School friends Jamie Armstrong (bass guitar), Ross Doyle (drums) and Brian Garvey (rhythm guitar), the band was torn apart in 2004 when Brian was killed in a car accident along with their close friend Richie Brookes. Deciding to carry on in Brian's memory, Davy, Jamie and Ross reformed the band, with Davy writing the emotional tribute to his friend & former bandmate, 'Stay', which was later to appear on a rare EP and on their debut album Roll Away. The band originally played only local shows around their hometown area of Port St. Mary. Shortly after, Armstrong quit the band to attend college in England, so Knowles brought in bassist and high school friend Adam Jones to replace him. In 2006, the band began to write their first record, with Knowles writing every song on the album with the exception of their cover of Blind Joe Reynolds' \\"Outside Woman Blues\\". On 26 June 2007, Knowles and Back Door Slam released their debut album, Roll Away. Knowles played lead guitar (both electric and acoustic) and sang the lead throughout the whole album. In 2008, after their first album released and was at number 7 on the Blues Billboard Chart, Knowles and Back Door Slam gained exposure at the South by Southwest Festival, Coachella, and Lollapalooza. At the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, Tennessee, Knowles and the band shot their first concert DVD, Back Door Slam: Live from Bonnaroo. Early in 2009, Knowles unexpectedly released a statement from the band, stating that they had split up, and each of the band's members were going to begin to pursue their own separate careers in music. \\"After much thought and soul searching, we have reached the painful decision that we should part ways at this time,\\" said Knowles in a statement on the band's website. \\"The decision was the hardest of our lives, but it's one we believe had to be made for each of us to move forward creatively and musically,\\" he added. Solo career After the breakup with Back Door Slam, Knowles quickly began his solo career under the name \\"Davy Knowles and Back Door Slam\\". His new backing band contained Fritz Lewak at drums, Kevin McCormick at bass, and Benmont Tench of the Heartbreakers at keyboards. Knowles said in an interview that he had gotten much stronger and comfortable with singing and songwriting during the time that he began to write his first solo album. On 16 June 2009, Knowles released his first solo album, entitled Coming Up For Air. This new album became quite popular among blues listeners, as it rose to number 2 on the Billboard Blues Albums Charts on two separate occasions, on 11‚Äì25 July 2009. After the release of his new album, Knowles went on tour, playing at several notable summer music festivals including the Mile High Festival, Rothbury Festival, Lollapalooza, and Summerfest, where he opened for Buddy Guy. In December 2009 Davy Knowles performed the song Come Home, live at BETA Records TV Studios in Hollywood, California. The acoustic song segment is taken from Season 3 of the BETA Records Music TV Series, directed by Eric MacIver and produced by Chris Honetschlaege. (Link to video) He is now on the road as Davy Knowles and Back Door Slam, with PK (bass), Steven Barci (drums) and Ty Bailie (keys). They opened for Chickenfoot in August/Sept 2009. In June 2009, Chickenfoot guitarist Joe Satriani described Davy as his \\"new favourite modern-day bluesman\\" in a Playlist article in the Sunday Times. He was on tour with The Rhythm Devils. Knowles continued to tour in support of the new album before turning his attention to documenting his musical influences in the documentary Island Bound, which was released as part of the Isle of Man Film Festival in 2014. Knowles also released his second solo album, The Outsider in 2014. The album featured two singles and lyric videos that Knowles released to his YouTube channel. One was the title track and the other was a cover of the gospel song Ain't No Grave. The album also features a cover of the Woody Guthrie song Pastures of Plenty. While touring in support of The Outsider in 2015 and early 2016, Knowles wrote and recorded his third solo album, Three Miles From Avalon. The album featured seven original songs as well as a reworking of the Willie Dixon song \\"What in the World\\". The album was released in October 2016, and reached number 5 in the Billboard Blues Albums Chart in its first week of release. Influences According to Knowles, the first band that influenced him was Dire Straits, whose song \\"Sultans of Swing\\" inspired him to begin playing the guitar after hearing it played in his father's car stereo. Because he was brought up in the Isle of Man, Knowles has publicly stated that, he draws a great deal of influence from the Celtic genre of music, particularly from the Irish guitarist Rory Gallagher. \\"Rory Gallagher understood Celtic influences, being an Irishman, and I saw that where I was growing up, too. We were only 50 or 60 miles off the coast of Ireland. So I had this big Celtic influence growing up. And when I heard him incorporating that into his music, that's when I really got into it,\\" said Knowles in an interview with the Seattle P.I.. Equipment Knowles uses a number of different guitars while on stage. His primary electric guitar until mid-2009 was the 1962 Fender Stratocaster Reissue, which he uses with Fender's SCN Samarium Cobalt Noiseless Stratocaster pickups. Knowles's other electric guitars are the Stevie Ray Vaughan Model Fender Stratocaster and Rio Grande brand pickups. Knowles uses the reissued Fender Mustang, which is only currently available in Japan. Knowles has one acoustic guitar that is used when he performs, a Gibson J-45 Acoustic. Along with these guitars, Knowles also uses Dean Markley guitar strings, ranging from 0.10 to 0.52 gauge. In mid-2009, Knowles began primarily using Paul Reed Smith guitars and Budda Amps while onstage. Knowles now uses PRS guitars, particularly the PRS 305. Knowles has two amplifiers for use with his guitars. The first is the Vox AC30 Heritage Collection Amp, and the other is the 1965 Fender Twin Reverb. For his effects, Knowles uses the Dunlop Cry Baby for his Wah pedal, and the Fulltone Distortion Pro for his distortion and a Behringer kazoo. Davy Knowles now uses the Freekish Blues Freek Out! (a Highly Modified Joyo Voodoo Octave) for fuzz. In addition to this, Knowles occasionally plays a 1944 Martin brand mandolin and a Dallas Arbiter electric trampoline in some of his songs.

Prior to molecular analyses the generic name had been used for any white-spored pleurotoid with amyloid spores. Unrelated but similar species are now classified in Sarcomyxa and Scytinotus. In older guides and other literature the type species had been placed in either Pleurotus or Panus and the poroid species had been classified in the synonymous genus Dictyopanus or in broadly defined genera like Polyporus (Polyporaceae) or the more closely allied Favolaschia (Mycenaceae). The closest molecular allies are Resinomycena and Cruentomycena. Description The fruit bodies of Panellus species are small- or medium-sized and in most cases pleurotoid, meaning they grow on wood, have gills (some species have pores instead of gills), and usually form semicircular or kidney-shaped caps that may be either directly attached to the wood, or connected by short stipes. The stipe is usually connected to the side of the cap, or off-center. The gills on the underside of the cap usually radiate outward from the attachment point, or may be strongly interveined to form a reticulum. The spores are hyaline (white in deposit), thin-walled, smooth and amyloid. Panellus is one of several genera in the Mycenaceae that are bioluminescent.

The murder, and subsequent trial and conviction of Werl√© and Lauber in 1993, received extensive media coverage in Germany and elsewhere. In 2009, Werl√© and Lauber again received international media coverage when Werl√© attempted to remove his name from foreign media sources, including the English language wikipedia, citing German privacy laws. Sedlmayr murder and trial On July 15, 1990, Sedlmayr's body was found in the bedroom of his Munich apartment. He had been tied up, stabbed in the stomach with a knife and was beaten about his head with a hammer. On May 21, 1993, a Munich court found Wolfgang Werl√© and his half-brother guilty of Sedlmayr's murder and sentenced both to life imprisonment. Sedlmayr was one of Germany's prominent actors, and the case was described by the Berliner Morgenpost as \\"the most spectacular in Munich's postwar history.\\" Witnesses at the trial said that the two brothers were involved in business disputes with Sedlmayr. The case became notable for its lurid tabloid newspaper coverage of Sedlmayr's homosexuality, which had previously been private. The German media reported the identities of both of the brothers at the time of the trial.Mordfall Walter Sedlmayr, Focus magazine article, 17 January 2005, in German) An appeal against the convictions was rejected in 1994. Werl√© was released on parole in August 2007, while Lauber was released in 2008. Both brothers continue to protest their innocence, and questions have been raised about the fingerprint evidence. In 1998, a fingerprint from the shower curtain of the apartment was identified as belonging to a 44-year-old man from Ingolstadt who had previously been questioned, but denied involvement with the murder. Privacy dispute On October 27, 2009, lawyers for Wolfgang Werl√© sent the Wikimedia Foundation a cease and desist letter requesting that Werl√©'s name be removed from the English language wikipedia article \\"Walter Sedlmayr\\", citing a 1973 Federal Constitutional Court decision that allows the suppression of a criminal's name in news accounts once he is released from custody.Copy of cease and desist letter Previously, the attorney for both men, Alexander H. Stopp, had won a default judgment in German court, on behalf of Lauber, against the Wikimedia Foundation. According to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Werl√©'s lawyers also challenged an Internet service provider in Austria which published the names of the convicted killers. The Wikimedia Foundation is based in the United States, where the First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects freedom of speech and freedom of the press, under which the articles on wikipedia would fall. In Germany, the law seeks to protect the name and likenesses of private persons from unwanted publicity. On January 18, 2008, a court in Hamburg supported the personality rights of Werl√©, which under German law includes removing his name from archive coverage of the case. On November 12, 2009, The New York Times reported that Wolfgang Werl√© had a case pending against the Wikimedia Foundation in a German court. The editors of the German-language wikipedia article about Sedlmayr removed the names of the murderers, which have since then been restored to the article. The Guardian observed that the lawsuit has led to the Streisand effect, an upsurge in publicity for the case resulting from the legal action. On December 15, 2009, the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) in Karlsruhe ruled that German websites do not have to check their archives in order to provide permanent protection of personality rights for convicted criminals. The case occurred after the names of the brothers were found on the website of Deutschlandradio, in an archive article dating from July 2000. The presiding judge Gregor Galke stated \\"This is not a blank check\\", and pointed out that the right to rehabilitation of offenders had been taken into consideration. On June 28, 2018, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the German Federal Court of Justice had been right to reject the request to ban publication of the killers' names in 2009, saying \\"The approach to covering a given subject was a matter of journalistic freedom, and reporting individualised information was an important aspect of the press's work.\\" References External links *Sedlmayr-M√∂rder ‚Äì Namen d√ºrfen genannt werden (in German, with picture gallery about the Sedlmayr case, December 16, 2009) *Sedlmayr-M√∂rder auf der Flucht (in German, about one of the half-brothers, the one liberated in 2007-Wolfgang Werl√©, March 19, 2010) Category:German people convicted of murder Category:People convicted of murder by Germany Category:Internet censorship in the United States Category:Living people Category:Sibling duos Category:German prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment Category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by Germany Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:1990 murders in Europe Category:1990 crimes in Germany Category:1990s murders in Germany ","title":"Wolfgang Werl√© and Manfred Lauber"},{"id":"25050392","text":"Romain Thomas (born 12 June 1988) is a French professional footballer who plays as a defender for Ligue 1 club Angers SCO.

He was initially deeply attracted to Jung's psychology, but when Jung's Answer to Job was published in English, he gave it a very critical review. White's works include Soul and Psyche and God and the Unconscious. Jung and White enjoyed a series of correspondence, and Jung was so impressed with some of White's ideas that he invited White to his retreat house at Bollingen, where only Jung's very close friends were allowed. The correspondence between Jung and White has been published by Lammers and Cunningham (2007). While White was a great admirer of Jung, he was at times very critical of Jung. For example, he criticised Jung's essay \\"On the Self\\", and accused Jung of being too bound to a Manichaean dualism. He was also somewhat critical of Jung's Kantianism. At the same time, Jung was quite critical of White, for example, over his commitment to the doctrine of privatio boni as means of understanding the problem of evil.  Letters  When Jung published Answer to Job, and again when it was published in English, White's fellow Roman Catholics reacted and what was once a ripple became a tidal wave. The Book of Job, a Wisdom book of the Bible, explores the problem of evil. White's correspondence with Jung made Jung refer to him as \\"my white raven\\", inasmuch as he was the only theologian who really understood something of the problem of psychology in the present world. He invited him to his retreat in Bollingen. White followed the Classical philosophy and Thomistic theology that defined evil as the absence of good (privatio boni). God, the ever-existing being, is himself good, whereas evil did not exist until it took origin in the devil and man. Jung's thought was that evil is not the absence of anything, but the active and dramatically impressive presence of something, personified and named the Devil. Evil ought to be considered a real force, not written-off as an opposite. For Jung a dogma could not be valid unless backed by empirical evidence, showing that it is prime, anything else had to be a dodge. According to some, Jung's greatest letters were written to White. Jung could see no evidence of 'privatio boni, but plenty of evil - devils, demons and other evil characters. The two, good and evil, are locked in an eternal duel for supremacy. Thus if one believes in just one God, He must contain the two within Himself. White could not accept this and just stated: God is light; in Him there is no darkness.(1John1:5-7). The conflict produced the Answer to Job, which some say is Jung's best work. White published a review of Answer to Job in the journal Blackfriars in March 1955. It was clear from this review that by this stage, White's feelings on the book were ambivalent, and he even seems to have had mixed feelings about his publication of the review, wondering how Jung would take the review. Jung, who trained as a psychiatrist at Zurich (First University), shows in his letters the reserved professional at work, yet often gives way to the poet and preacher. He is clear, though, that it would be beyond the competence of scientific empiricism to talk about the divine entity. He says that he does not preach but attempts to establish psychological facts. He can confirm and prove inter-relationship of the God image with other parts of the psyche, but he cannot go further without committing the error of a metaphysical assertion which is far beyond his scope. He is not a theologian and he has nothing to say about the nature of God. Their letters also touched on non-theological matters, such as their mutual acquaintance, Barbara Robb, who founded (1965) and organised the highly effective pressure group Aid for the Elderly in Government Institutions (AEGIS).

A devoted Nazi as well as a Leipzig lecturer and researcher, he joined the SS as a physician in the 1930s, reaching the SS rank of Sturmbannf√ºhrer. Pl√∂tner participated in a series of research tasks involving human experimentation at the Dachau concentration camp during the Second World War II. These included participation in the malaria experiments of Claus Schilling, in which prisoners were injected with drugs at lethal doses.

Inflammation. 33(1):1-9. multiple sclerosis and mortality in the general population. Performing the suPARnostic ELISA Performing the suPARnostic ELISA requires two antibodies with high specificity for suPAR. The blood plasma sample from the patient that contains an unknown amount of suPAR is immobilized on the microwells on the clear microtiter plate and a detection antibody forms a complex with suPAR. Between each step the plate is rinsed with a wash buffer to dispose of any proteins that do not specifically bind to any of the wells on the plate. After the final wash step, the plate is developed by adding the TMB substrate to produce a visible signal, which indicates the quantity of suPAR in the sample. The measured absorbance can, based on the values from the standard curve, be converted to the concentration (ng/mL) of suPAR in the sample. This level can then suggest whether or not the patient is experiencing challenges to their immune system. Principles The suPARnostic ELISA is a simplified double monoclonal antibody sandwich assay that measures the level of suPAR and suPARII-III in the body . The suPARnostic ELISA utilizes monoclonal mouse and rat antibodies against human suPAR. The advantages of using monoclonal antibodies compared to using polyclonal antibodies includes: High homogeneity, absence of nonspecific antibodies and no batch-to-batch or lot-to-lot variability. This results in a very robust and reliable assay. A 'sandwich' is formed of solid-phase antibody, suPAR and peroxidase-conjugated antibody. The concentration (ng/mL plasma) of suPAR in the patient sample is determined via interpolation, based on a calibration curve prepared from seven suPAR standards. Recombinant suPAR standards are calibrated against healthy human blood donor samples. Absorbance is measured using a microtiter plate reader, at 450 nm with a 650 nm reference filter. Measurement of suPAR levels from blood samples provides greater accuracy and precision than measurement from urine or cerebral spinal fluid. suPAR level is not changed by transient illness such as cold. It also remains stable after a blood sample is taken despite storage.suPARnostic Kit insert, (2008) 2nd Edition, 1-23 suPARnostic measurements between 0.1 and 4.0 ng/mL suggest that a patient is healthy, with no challenges to their immune system and no signs or symptoms of an opportunistic infection or inflammation; the average level among the population is 3.4 ng/mL. However, a patient's immune system can be considered 'negatively activated' at suPAR levels above 4.0 and up to 6.0 ng/mL, indicating a potential infection or high level of inflammation. In this case, a patient's health is likely to worsen and he or she should be referred for further testing. suPARnostic measurements from 6.0 ng/mL to double digit levels can indicate a serious illness that is progressing rapidly to a critical situation. Patients in the intensive care unit average a level of 10.0 ng/mL. There is no difference in suPAR levels intrinsic to various races; however, the scale varies for male and female. There are two suPARnostic tests available. The suPARnostic Standard ELISA (Code No. A001) is for research use and large trials, one batch consisting of 41 samples in doublets. The suPARnostic Flex ELISA (Code No. A002) has been developed for clinical applications consisting of 93 samples, is modular and flexible, and gives fully quantitative results in 2 hours. Practical Considerations The suPARnostic kit has a refrigerated shelf life of several years and when frozen, may be kept for longer. The kit should sit at room temperature for half an hour before use but it may be held at room temperature for as long as three to four hours. The suPARnostic Flex ELISA (Code No. A002) is able to provide fully quantitative results in 2 hours. suPARnostic is run as large, batch test with up to 41 samples in doublets for research purposes or 93 samples for clinical use at one time. Although suPARnostic currently does not have FDA approval, it is CE/IVD marked for distribution throughout Europe. suPAR is a prognostic test to indicate general health, and it cannot be used as a diagnostic tool to suggest a particular illness. suPAR cannot be used in the detection of brain tumors because the suPAR molecule cannot migrate through the blood brain barrier.

Published in 2009, it covers the history of the National Basketball Association (NBA). In 2019, Simmons launched a sequel podcast series, Book of Basketball 2.0, which analyzes the evolution of the league since the book was published. Background At the time of the book's publishing, Simmons had been writing under the name ‚ÄúThe Sports Guy‚Äù for 12 years, 9 of them with ESPN, and was receiving 1.4 million page views per month.Zengerle, Jason. Holiday Bookes: Fans‚Äô Notes. The New York Times. December 3, 2009. In 2006, he started developing the idea for The Book of Basketball, spending three years reading over 80 books on basketball and watching 400 game tapes.Bennett, Dashiell. Bill Simmons‚Äô The Book Of Basketball Is A Sports Book For The Internet Age. Business Insider. December 19, 2010. Simmons's goal in the book was to figure out why some players or teams matter more than others.Leitch, Will. Hoop Memes: Bill Simmons. New York Magazine. October 25, 2009. The original premise for the book was to \\"blow up the Basketball Hall of Fame and reconstruct it like an Egyptian pyramid.\\"Pinter, Jason. Interview with Bill Simmons, Author of The Book of Basketball. Huffington Post. October 21, 2009.\\"The Book of Basketball\\" ‚Äì Three-Pointer for The Sports Guy. Bleacher Report. May 26, 2010. As he continued his research, he realized that there was \\"no real way to compare players from different eras without a common theme in place.\\" Simmons derived an idea that he admitted was not perfect, but helped in finding a fair ranking system for players past and present. He took into account NBA championships, regular season and playoff statistics, as well as longevity and flair. While the book's Hall of Fame-related sections comprise about half the pages used (from 263 to 627, spanning chapters six through 11, in the paperback), the book leads into this by covering several key matters in NBA history. These involve Simmons' recounting of his father (Bill Sr.) purchasing a season ticket for only $4 a game as the Celtics rose and fell and rose (and critically rose when Larry Bird arrived in Boston); a meeting with Simmons' non-fan Isiah Thomas that turned into a surprisingly friendly discussion about \\"The Secret of basketball\\"; an overview of how Bill Russell was the greatest center of all-time (and NOT Wilt Chamberlain); a history of how the NBA evolved between 1949 and 1984 into what it is today; dozens of what-if scenarios for the NBA (including \\"What if the Detroit Pistons had drafted Carmelo Anthony instead of Darko Milicic in 2003?\\" and \\"What if the 1984 NBA Draft had unfolded differently?\\"); and a breakdown of past Most Valuable Player awards that were divided into completely deserving winners (all five trophies won by Michael Jordan), winners who were questionable but ultimately all right (such as Bill Walton's win in 1978) and winners who were travesties of justice (Jordan losing out to Charles Barkley in 1993 and Karl Malone in 1997). Stories are included of \\"The first time I witnessed this player live\\" moments that Bill recounts from his childhood, as well as anecdotes from his professional career in sports writing. In 2010, Simmons released an updated paperback version of the book, cutting out 30 pages from the original, fixing factual errors, adding new material, including fixing footnotes, updating his Hall of Fame Pyramid, and including a virtual guide. This updated version was released on December 7th, 2010. Synopsis From The Wall Street Journal: :\\"In what passes for structure, Mr. Simmons offers a brief (for him) history of the league. Then he \\"corrects\\" every mistaken MVP award the NBA ever handed out. Then he imagines every detail of a new and improved Basketball Hall of Fame, naming the 96 players who belong there and offering an analysis of each selection. Then he ranks the top 20 teams of all time. Finally, he conjures up the perfect 12-man roster to face a team of Martians with the fate of Earth on the line‚Äîwith the 1985 version of Magic Johnson passing to a 1992 vintage of Mr. Jordan and the 2003 Tim Duncan rebounding.\\"Thompson, Adam.

The Wall Street Journal notes that \\"Mr. Simmons may not resolve every long-standing hoops debate‚Äîwho could?‚Äîbut he compensates with plenty of detail and humor. And he has produced enough provocative arguments to fuel barstool arguments far into the future.\\" Several writers in New York's Vulture Blog objected to sexism in the book. Tommy Craggs found Simmons' sexism \\"astounding\\", citing Simmons' quote: \\"Every time I watch Jason Kidd play, initially it's like seeing a girl walk into a bar who's just drop-dead gorgeous, but then when he throws up one of those bricks, it's like the gorgeous girl taking off her jacket and you see she has tiny mosquito bites for tits.\\" Ben Mathis-Lilley found Simmons' sexism \\"intrusively abhorrent\\", stating that \\"I actually stopped bothering to copy down the most egregious comments and figured I'd just note when Simmons mentioned a woman for any reason other than evaluating her appeal as something to put a penis in.

Amongst the theories advanced in the book, Lane endorses the hydrogen hypothesis for the formation of the eukaryotic cell, whereby mitochondria are the original defining characteristic of the structure. He argues that the event was an exceedingly improbable one and questions the likelihood of it having happened elsewhere in the Universe. He also suggests that the necessity for genetic compatibility between mitochondrial and nuclear DNA lies behind the differentiation of biological genders, ensuring that only one sexual partner contributes mitochondrial DNA to offspring.
