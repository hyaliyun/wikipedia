It has since expanded to Tanzania, Mozambique, DRC, Lesotho, Ghana, Egypt, Afghanistan and South Africa. Meanwhile services in India, Romania, and Albania have been terminated amid low market uptake. M-Pesa allows users to deposit, withdraw, transfer money, pay for goods and services (Lipa na M-Pesa), access credit and savings, all with a mobile device. The service allows users to deposit money into an account stored on their cell phones, to send balances using PIN-secured SMS text messages to other users, including sellers of goods and services, and to redeem deposits for regular money. Users are charged a small fee for sending and withdrawing money using the service. M-Pesa is a branchless banking service; M-Pesa customers can deposit and withdraw money from a network of agents that includes airtime resellers and retail outlets acting as banking agents. M-Pesa has spread quickly, and by 2010 had become the most successful mobile-phone-based financial service in the developing world. By 2012, a stock of about 17 million M-Pesa accounts had been registered in Kenya. By June 2016, a total of 7 million M-Pesa accounts have been opened in Tanzania by Vodacom. The service has been lauded for giving millions of people access to the formal financial system and for reducing crime in otherwise largely cash-based societies. History M-Pesa kiosk in Nairobi, Kenya in 2016. Safaricom and Vodafone launched M-PESA, a mobile-based payment service targeting the un-banked, pre-pay mobile subscribers in Kenya on a pilot basis in October 2005.https://www.safaricom.co.ke/personal/m-pesa It was started as a public/private sector initiative after Vodafone was successful in winning funds from the Financial Deepening Challenge Fund competition established by the UK Government‚Äôs Department for International Development to encourage private sector companies to engage in innovative projects so as to deepen the provision of financial services in emerging economies.https://www.safaricom.co.ke/annualreport_2019/ The initial obstacle in the pilot was gaining the agent‚Äôs trust and encouraging them to process cash withdrawals and agent training.https://www.safaricom.co.ke/images/Downloads/Safaricom_Annual_Report_2019.pdf However, once Vodafone introduced the ability to buy airtime using M-PESA, the transaction volume increased rapidly. A 5% discount was offered on any airtime purchased through M-PESA and this served as an effective incentive. By first March 2006, 50.7 million Kshs had been transferred through the system. The successful operation of the pilot was a key component in Vodafone and Safaricom‚Äôs decision to take the product full scale. The learning from the pilot helped to confirm the market need for the service and although it mainly revolved around facilitating loan repayments and disbursements for Faulu customers, it also tested features such as airtime purchase and national remittance. The full commercial launch was initiated in March 2007. A snap shot of the market then depicted that only a small percentage of people in Kenya used traditional banking services. There were low levels of bank income, high bank fees incurred and charged; most of the services were out of geographical reach to the rural Kenyan. Notably, a high level of mobile penetration was evident throughout the country making the adoption of mobile payments a viable alternative to the traditional banking channels. According to a survey done by CBS in 2005, Kenya then had over 5,970,600 people employed in the informal sector. This informal sector constituted 98% In 2002, researchers at Gamos and the Commonwealth Telecommunications Organisation, funded by Department for International Development UK (DFID), documented that in Uganda, Botswana and Ghana, people were spontaneously using airtime as a proxy for money transfer. Kenyans were transferring airtime to their relatives or friends who were then using it or reselling it. Gamos researchers approached MCel in Mozambique, and in 2004 MCel introduced the first authorised airtime credit swapping ‚Äì a precursor step towards M-Pesa. The idea was discussed by the Commission for AfricaScott N, Batchelor S, Ridley J and Jorgensen B 2004 The impact of mobile phones in. Africa, background paper prepared for the Commission for Africa, London. and DFID introduced the researchers to Vodafone who had been discussing supporting microfinance and back office banking with mobile phones. S Batchelor (Gamos) and N Hughes (Vodafone CSR) discussed how a system of money transfer could be created in Kenya. DFID amended the terms of reference for its grant to Vodafone, and piloting began in 2005. Safaricom launched a new mobile phone-based payment and money transfer service, known as M-Pesa. The initial work of developing the product was given to a product and technology development company known as Sagentia. Development and second line support responsibilities were transferred to IBM in September 2009, where most of the original Sagentia team transferred to. Following a three-year migration project to a new technology stack, as of 26 February 2017, IBM's responsibilities have been transferred to Huawei in all markets. Concept Image showing an individual using the MPESA mobile money transfer. The initial concept of M-Pesa was to create a service which would allow microfinance borrowers to conveniently receive and repay loans using the network of Safaricom airtime resellers. This would enable microfinance institutions (MFIs) to offer more competitive loan rates to their users, as costs are lower than when dealing in cash. The users of the service would gain through being able to track their finances more easily. When the service was piloted, customers adopted the service for a variety of alternative uses and complications arose with Faulu, the partnering MFI. In discussion with other parties, M-Pesa was re-focused and launched with a different value proposition: sending remittances home across the country and making payments. Services Safaricom's M-Pesa service screen on a Nokia feature phone. M-Pesa is operated by Safaricom and Vodacom, mobile network operators (MNO) not classed as deposit-taking institutions, such as a bank. M-Pesa customers can deposit and withdraw money from a network of agents that includes airtime resellers and retail outlets acting as banking agents. The service enables its users to: * deposit and withdraw money * transfer money to other users * pay bills * purchase airtime * save money in a virtual account (Mshwari) * transfer money between the service and, in some markets like Kenya, a bank account *Borrow money to complete transaction when you have insufficient cash(Fuliza) Partnerships with Kenyan banks offer expanded banking services like interest-bearing accounts, loans, and insurance. The user interface technology of M-Pesa differs between Safaricom of Kenya and Vodacom of Tanzania, although the underlying platform is the same. While Safaricom uses SIM toolkit (STK) to provide handset menus for accessing the service, Vodacom relies mostly on USSD to provide users with menus, but also supports STK.Vaughan, P. (2008, 15 July). Providing the Unbanked with Access to Financial Services: The Case of M-PESA in Kenya. Presentation given during the Mobile Banking & Financial Services Africa conference in Johannesburg, South Africa. Cost, transaction charges, statistics Transaction charges depend on the amount of money being transferred and whether the payee is a registered user of the service. The actual cost is a fixed amount for a given range of transaction sizes; for example Safaricom charges up to 66 KShs ( USD) for a transaction to an unregistered user for transactions between 101-500 KShs (‚Äì USD) and 27 KShs ( USD) for a transfer to a registered user for the same amount. At the highest transfer bracket of 50,001-70,000 KShs the fee for a transfer to a registered user is 110 KShs ( USD). The maximum amount that can be transferred to a non-registered user of the system is 35,000 KShs ( USD), with a fee of 275 KShs ( USD). Cash withdrawal fees are also charged. With a charge of 10 KShs ( USD), for a withdrawal of 50-100 KShs, up to 330 Kshs ( USD) for a withdrawal of 50,001-70,000 KShs.New MPESA tariffs released, 2013-02.M-PESA statistics , 2013‚Äì11.

In 2016 M-Pesa moved 15 billion KShs ( USD) per day equivalent to 52 billion CHF in Kenya, with a revenue of 41 billion KShs. In 2017 6,869 billion KShs were moved according to a figure in Safaricoms own annual report, with a revenue of 55 billion KShs. This would put Safaricom's profit ratio at around <1% of total money transferred ‚Äì nothing like 27% but still a high figure.Daily Nation article, 2016-05-08.https://www.safaricom.co.ke/images/Downloads/Resources_Downloads/Safaricom_2017_Annual_Report.pdf Safaricom 2017 annual report  Effect on poverty in Kenya  M-Pesa is widely seen as demonstrating that it is possible to make a profit while also improving the lives of the poor. Tavneet Suri, based at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and William Jack, based at Georgetown University have produced a series of papers extolling benefits of M-Pesa. In particular, their 2016 article published in \\"Science\\" has been very influential in the international development community. The much cited result of the paper was, that 'access to M-PESA increased per capita consumption levels and lifted 194,000 households, or 2% of Kenyan households, out of poverty. Global development institutions focusing on the development potential of financial technology frequently cite M-Pesa as a major success story in this respect, citing the poverty-reduction-claim and including a reference to Suri and Jack‚Äôs 2016 signature article. In a report on \\"Financing for Development\\", the United Nations write: \\"The digitalization of finance offers new possibilities for greater financial inclusion and alignment with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and implementation of the Social Development Goals. In Kenya, the expansion of mobile money lifted two per cent of households in the country above the poverty line.\\"United Nations. 2018.

Markets Kenya An M-Pesa payment register at a Kenyan coffee shop M-Pesa was first launched by the Kenyan mobile network operator Safaricom, where Vodafone is technically a minority shareholder (40%), in March 2007.Hughes, N., & Lonie, S.

M-Pesa quickly captured a significant market share for cash transfers, and grew to 17 million subscribers by December 2011 in Kenya alone. The growth of the service forced formal banking institutions to take note of the new venture. In December 2008, a group of banks reportedly lobbied the Kenyan finance minister to audit M-Pesa, in an effort to at least slow the growth of the service. This ploy failed, as the audit found that the service was robust. At this time the Banking Act did not provide basis to regulate products offered by non-banks, of which M-Pesa was one such very successful product. As at November 2014, M-Pesa transactions for the 11 months of 2014 were valued at 2.1 trillion KSh, a 28% increase from 2013, and almost half the value of the country's GDP. On 19 November 2014, Safaricom launched a companion android app Safaricom M-Ledger for its M-Pesa users. The application, currently available only on Android, gives M-Pesa users a historical view of all their transactions. Many other companies business models rely on the M-Pesa system in Kenya, such as M-kopa and Sportpesa. On 23 February 2018, it was reported that the Google Play store started taking payments for apps via Kenya's M-Pesa service. On 8 January 2019, Safaricom launched Fuliza, an M-Pesa overdraft facility. Tanzania M-Pesa was launched in Tanzania by Vodacom in 2008 but its initial ability to attract customers fell short of expectations. In 2010, the International Finance Corporation released a report which explored many of these issues in greater depth and analyzed the strategic changes that Vodacom has implemented to improve their market position. As of May 2013, M-Pesa in Tanzania has five million subscribers. Afghanistan In 2008 Vodafone partnered with Roshan, Afghanistan's primary mobile operator, to provide M-Pesa, the local brand of the service. When the service was launched it was initially used to pay policemen's salaries set to be competitive with what the Taliban were earning. Soon after the product was launched, the Afghan National Police found that under the previous cash model, 10% of their workforce were ghost police officers who did not exist; their salaries had been pocketed by others. When corrected in the new system, many police officers believed that they had received a raise or that there had been a mistake, as their salaries rose significantly. The National Police discovered that there was so much corruption when payments had been made using the previous model that the policemen did not know their true salary. The service has been so successful that it has been expanded to include limited merchant payments, peer-to-peer transfers, loan disbursements and payments. South Africa In September 2010 Vodacom and Nedbank announced the launch of the service in South Africa, where there were estimated to be more than 13 million \\"economically active\\" people without a bank account. M-Pesa has been slow to gain a toehold in the South African market compared to Vodacom's projections that it would sign up 10 million users in the following three years. By May 2011, it had registered approximately 100,000 customers. The gap between expectations for M-Pesa's performance and its actual performance can be partly attributed to differences between the Kenyan and South African markets, including the banking regulations at the time of M-Pesa's launch in each country. According to MoneyWeb, a South African investment website, \\"A tough regulatory environment with regards to customer registration and the acquisition of outlets also compounded the company's troubles, as the local regulations are more stringent in comparison to our African counterparts. Lack of education and product understanding also hindered efforts in the initial roll out of the product.\\" In June 2011, Vodacom and Nedbank launched a campaign to re-position M-Pesa, targeting the product to potential customers who have a higher Living Standard Measures (LSM) than were first targeted. Despite efforts, as at March 2015, M-Pesa still struggled to grow its customer base. South Africa lags behind Tanzania and Kenya with only c.1 million subscribers. This comes as no surprise as South Africa is well known for being ahead of financial institutions globally in terms of maturity and technological innovation. According to Genesis Analytics, 70% of South Africans are \\"banked\\", meaning that they have at least one bank account with an established financial institution which have their own banking products which directly compete with the M-Pesa offering. India M-Pesa was launched in India as a close partnership with ICICI bank in November 2011.ICICI Launch. \\"ICICI Launch\\". Retrieved 28 June 2012 Development for the bank began as early as 2008. Vodafone India had partnered with both ICICI and ICICI bank,ICICI Bank. \\"ICICI Bank\\". Retrieved 28 June 2012 ICICI launched M-Pesa on 18 April 2013. Vodafone had planned to roll out this service throughout India. The user needed to register for this service, registration was free and there were charges levied per M-Pesa transaction for money transfer services and DTH and Prepaid recharges could be done through M-Pesa for free. M-Pesa was shut down from 15 July 2019 due to regulatory curbs and stress in the sector, with Vodafone surrendering their PPI licence on 1 October 2019. Eastern Europe In March 2014, M-Pesa expanded into Romania, while mentioning that it may continue to expand elsewhere into Eastern Europe, as a number of individuals there possess mobile phones but do not possess traditional bank accounts. It is unlikely, as of May 2014, however, that the service will expand into Western Europe anytime soon. In December 2017 Vodafone closed its M-Pesa product in Romania.https://www.zf.ro/business-hi-tech/grupul-vodafone-pune- capat-experimentului-m-pesa-din-romania-serviciul-de-plati-de-pe-telefonul- mobil-se-inchide-la-1-decembrie-16766209 In May 2015, M-PESA was also launched in Albania. It was shut down on 14 July 2017. Other markets M-Pesa expanded into Mozambique, Lesotho, and Egypt in May, June, and July 2013, respectively. A full listing of countries in which M-Pesa currently operates can be found on M-Pesa's website.http://www.vodafone.com/content/index/about/about- us/money_transfer.html Regulation and KYC rules M-Pesa sought to engage Kenyan regulators and keep them updated on the development process. M-Pesa also reached out to international regulators, such as the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the payment card industry to understand how best to protect client information and adhere to internationally recognized best practices. Know your customer (KYC) requirements impose obligations on prospective clients and on banks to collect identification documents of clients and then to have those documents verified by banks.Mas, I. (2011). Why Are Banks So Scarce in Developing Countries? Critical Review: A Journal of Politics and Society, 23(1‚Äì2), 135‚Äì145. The Kenyan government issues national identity cards that M-Pesa leveraged in their business processes to satisfy their KYC requirements. M-Pesa obtained a \\"special\\" license from regulators, despite concerns by regulators about non-branch banking adding to the current state of financial instability. Third-party integration Safaricom released the new M-Pesa platform dubbed M-Pesa G2 to offer versatile integration capabilities for development partners. Client-to-business and business-to- client disbursements are some of features available through the API.  Criticism  The near-monopolistic providers of the M-Pesa service are sometimes criticized for the high cost that the service imposes on its often poor users. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation warned in 2013 that lack of competition could drive up prices for customers of mobile money services and used M-Pesa in Kenya as a negative example. According to the Foundation, a transfer of $1.50 cost $0.30 at the time, while the same provider charged only a tenth of this in neighboring Tanzania, where it was exposed to more competition. A study sponsored by USAID found that poor uneducated customers, who often had bad vision, were a target of unfair practices within M-Pesa. They had expensive subscriptions for ring-tones and similar unnecessary services pushed on them,with opaque pricing, and thus did not understand, why their M-Pesa deposits depleted so quickly. If they did, they were often unable to unsubscribe from those Services without help. The authors concluded that it is not the marginalized people in Kenya, who benefit from M-Pesa, but mostly Safaricom. A similar conclusion was reached by development economist Alan Gibson in a study commissioned by Financial Sector Deepening Trust Kenya (FSD Kenya) on occasion of the 10th Anniversary of FSD Kenya in 2016.Alan Gibson: FSD Kenya: Ten Years of a Market Systems Approach in the Kenyan Financial Market. FSD Kenya, August 2016. He wrote that credit to business did not improve due to M-Pesa and that credit to the agricultural sector even declined. He concluded in his otherwise very friendly survey that the financial sector benefitted handsomely from the expansion of M-Pesa, while the living conditions of the people were not noticeably improved. Milford Bateman et al. even conclude that M-Pesa's expansion resulted in holding back economic development in Kenya. They diagnose serious weaknesses in the much cited paper by Suri and Jack, which had found positive effects on poverty, as M-Pesa enabled female clients to move out of subsistence agriculture into micro- enterprise or small-scale trading activities. Alleged weaknesses include a failure to incorporate business failures and crowding-out of competitors in the analysis. Bateman et al. call M-Pesa an extractive activity, by which large profits are created from taxing small-scale payments, which would be free if cash was used, instead. As a large part of these profits are sent abroad to foreign shareholders of Safaricom, local spending power and demand are reduced, and with it the development potential for local enterprise.Milford Bateman, Maren Duvendack & Nicholas Loubere: \\"Is fin-tech the new panacea for poverty alleviation and local development?

The line is one of the new high-speed lines being built to strengthen rail transport system in Italy and in particular freight and passenger transport in Campania. The line is part of Corridor 1 of the European Union's Trans-European high-speed rail network, which connects Berlin and Palermo. Route and features The infrastructure of the new line was completed in April 2008 with its electrification, which operates at 3 kV DC, not the 25 kV AC used on most new high-speed railways in Italy. It became available for training in May 2008 and for public operations in the following month. The line allows the reduction of congestion of rail traffic on the Naples‚ÄìSalerno coast line, as trains can travel on the new line. The new line starts at Roma Est junction, which allows trains from the Rome‚ÄìNaples high-speed line to continue south on a branch to Casoria junction where there is a link with the main rail node of Naples. The line passes the towns of Volla, Pomigliano d'Arco, Sant'Anastasia, Somma Vesuviana, Nola, Ottaviano, San Gennaro Vesuviano, Palma Campania, Poggiomarino and Striano, through a series of small cut-and-cover tunnels and elevated sections, reaching the commune of San Valentino Torio, where it is currently connects at Sarno junction to the end of the line from Sarno. The Italian government announced in an economic statement in July 2004 that a future high-capacity line would be built from the end of the line at San Valentino Torio to Battipaglia to create a four-track line through Salerno to Battipaglia as part of a project to build a high-capacity trunk line to Reggio Calabria. The new line has allowed high-speed trains to avoid Naples since the opening of the section from Roma Est junction to the new Napoli Afragola station in June 2017. From June 2008, most Trenitalia Eurostar Italia, Intercity and Intercity Plus trains between Naples and Salerno were routed over the new line, allowing an increase in commuter trains on the old coast line under a project to develop a Campania \\"regional metro\\". Proposed new Vesuvio Est interchange station The Region of Campania and Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI, the owner of the rail network) have identified the site for the construction of a new passenger station called \\"Vesuvio Est\\" (Vesuvius East) in the commune of Striano, which will allow passengers to interchange with the Circumvesuviana Naples‚ÄìOttaviano‚ÄìSarno railway line. On 30 March 2007 an international competition was launched for the preliminary and final design of the station with a prize of ‚Ç¨1,245,000. The estimated cost of the new station is ‚Ç¨32.5 million and according to the agreement between Campania and RFI was planned to be completed in 2008 or 2009. The station will have an area of indoors and in total. Its catchment area will be the Agro Nocerino Sarnese area and the area south-east of Mount Vesuvius, which have a total population of 742,000. It will offer fast connections with Salerno and Naples and eventually with Rome, Battipaglia and Reggio di Calabria. RFI (Rete Ferroviaria Italiana) announced in 2010 January 22 that it had selected the Italian-Belgian group led by Samyn and Partners architects and engineers to design the proposed Vesuvio Est high speed station on the Napoli ‚Äì Salerno route. According to RFI estimates, the new station will be served by about 196 trains a day (52 long distance trains and 144 Circumvesuviana trains, a train every 15 minutes) and will be used by about 10,000 passengers per day, including 2,000 in the peaks. It is expected that about 1,500 non-travellers will go to the station for other reasons as it is planned to provide space for commercial uses, banking, a post office and restaurants. It is proposed to build a 1,000 place car park and areas for taxis and buses to stop; there will also be a possible link with the A30 motorway and the SS268 highway.

This movie was huge at the box office.  Plot  Abijot (Harbhajan Mann) and Mitro (Tulip Joshi) become friends as children. Abijot hails from a rich, high class family while Mitro belongs to a poor, low class family. The 2 families do not like them playing and spending time with each other so Abijot's family sends him and his cousin Roop (Gulzar Inder Chahal) to Chandigarh where they both can do their studies away from Mitro and her family. Fifteen years later, Abijot and Roop come back. Abijot meets Mitro and they really want to marry each other, but their family differences come in the way and those differences do not allow their union. Mitro's family decides to marry her off to someone else, but on the day of her wedding she consumes poison and runs to Abijot. She tells Abijot that she is leaving and will meet him again in this birth before dying. Abijot gets depressed so he decides to leave India and come to Canada, where his mind will be kept off of Mitro. Abijot stays at his mama's (uncle ‚Äì i.e. mother's brother) house but his cousin Terry, is jealous of Abijot receiving attention and wants him to leave. So Abijot moves into Lucky's house (Gurpreet Ghuggi), his childhood friend who is married to a black woman. Roop calls Abijot and says that he will come to Canada soon. One day Abijot and Lucky go to a coffee shop and Abijot sees exactly the same double of Mitro, named Ekam but it turns out she is blind. Abijot's mama feels bad for Abijot so he buys Abijot an apartment. Abijot comforts Ekam and, they both fall in love. Abijot asks her what her dream is and she says it's to see this world again. Abijot calls his parents in India, he lies and tells them he needs money to buy a house. Abijot's mama receives the money and gives it to Abijot and is pleased Abijot will have a house to live in. Instead of buying a house he pays for Ekam's surgery with the money which is successful. When it's time for Ekam to take the bandage off her eyes Abijot is not there. Ekam refuses to take off the bandage because she wants to see Abijot's face first. The doctor ultimately takes off Ekam's bandage because he has another patient to take care of. Abijot rushes but a man, named Iqbal who is Ekam's fianc√© gets there before him. Ekam and her family thought he left her because she was blind but, it turns out he left because his father got murdered and, the police arrested and jailed him for few years. Abijot sadly leaves them both. After the operation is declared successful, Ekam is unhappy at seeing Iqbal because she loves Abijot. Abijot's father gets sick so Abijot leaves for India, and Roop comes to Canada. Abijot's father says that all he wants is to see him married, so Abijot agrees. Ekam's father tells her she can marry whoever she wants, and Ekam decides on Abijot so she goes to meet him to see if he wants to marry her. Ekam rushes to Abijot's apartment, but she finds Roop there. After seeing Ekam, Roop calls her Mitro. Ekam remembers Abijot said that he will call her by Mitro instead of Ekam. Then she sees pictures of a girl who looks exactly like her and remembers that Abijot told her he met 2 girls that are not related but look exactly the same. Ekam is confused so she asks who is Mitro and where is Abijot? Roop says Mitro is Abijot's love, and that Abijot went to India. Ekam misunderstands and thinks Abijot did a favor on her and went back for Mitro. Roop says Mitro died a year ago and that he went back to meet his sick father. Ekam is shocked. Abijot's engagement preparations are being made until Roop brings Ekam up. Everyone is shocked and cannot believe this is Mitro because she died. Abijot tells them that this is Ekam, and he also tells them that before dying, Mitro said she will meet him again in this birth and here she is. The two families finally realize that two lovers can never be separated and consent to their union. Abijot and Ekam live happily ever after.  Cast  *Harbhajan Mann ... Abhijot *Tulip Joshi ...

It is now part of the Pinewood Studios Group. During its early existence the studio was branded as Sound City. History 1930s‚Äì1960s Shepperton Studios was built on the grounds of Littleton Park, which was built in the 17th century by local nobleman Thomas Wood. The old mansion still stands on the site. Scottish businessman Norman Loudon purchased Littleton Park in 1931 for use by his new film company, Sound Film Producing & Recording Studios; the facility opened in 1932. The studios, which produced both short and feature films, expanded rapidly. Proximity to the Vickers-Armstrongs aircraft factory at Brooklands, which attracted German bombers, disrupted filming during the Second World War, as did the requisitioning of the studios in 1941 by the government, who first used it for sugar storage and later to create decoy aircraft and munitions for positioning in the Middle East. The Ministry of Aircraft Production also took over part of the studios for the production of Vickers Wellington bomber components early in the war. After re-opening in 1945, the studios changed hands. When Sir Alexander Korda purchased British Lion Films, he also acquired a controlling interest in Sound City and Shepperton Studios.Shepperton Studios - History Among the films in which he was involved during this period were The Fallen Idol (1948) and The Third Man (1949) which was shot both at the studios and on location and has been referred to as the best British film noir.See for example ; reprinted in Derek Malcolm A Century of Films, London & New York: I.B Tauris, 2000, p.51-53, 51 In spite of such successes, British Lion ran into financial difficulties in the 1950s when it was unable to repay a 1949 loan from the National Film Finance Corporation and went into receivership on 1 July 1954.The Times, 2 June 1954, page 6: Receiver for British Lion Film Corporation ‚Äì found in the Times Digital Archive (subscription required) 25 July 2014 In January 1955, a new company, British Lion Films Ltd, was formed and Roy and John Boulting took over at Shepperton Studios. Their comedies, such as I'm All Right Jack (1959), were produced there, as were dramas from other film-makers such as J. Lee Thompson's The Guns of Navarone (1961). The studio's other projects from the same decade include Stanley Kubrick's Dr Strangelove (1964)the casting credits after the film indicate the studio. and the musical Oliver! (1968), which won the Academy Award for Best Picture. 1970s to the present Street Sign at Shepperton Studios Despite the financial ups and downs of British Lion and the changing of hands, the studios remained active until the early 1970s. In 1969, the studios produced 27 films; by 1971 this number had fallen to seven. Production throughout the 1970s was erratic, reaching a low of two films by 1979. Among the problems faced by Shepperton Studios during this time was the desire of new British Lion director John Bentley to sell the grounds for housing, since redeveloping the land would have nearly doubled its value. A compromise was proposed, and in 1973 the area of the studios was reduced from to . The studios' 1970s credits include Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange and Jimmy Perry and David Croft's Dad's Army (both 1971), Richard Attenborough's Young Winston (1972) and Fred Zinnemann's The Day of the Jackal (1973). Also around this time, the rock group Led Zeppelin filmed some concert scenes at Shepperton that were used in their live concert film, \\"The Song Remains the Same\\", these scenes were used to fill in the gap of parts of a Madison Square Garden concert from 1973. In 1975, the studios were again transferred to new ownership and in spite of sparse production schedules served as the filming site of some high-budget productions, including Richard Donner's The Omen (1976), Franklin Schaffner's The Boys from Brazil (1978), Ridley Scott's Alien (1979), David Lynch's The Elephant Man (1980), Attenborough's Gandhi (1982) and David Lean's A Passage to India (1984). Rock band The Who filmed live concert scenes at Shepperton especially for their documentary The Kids Are Alright (1979). It would wind up being the band's final live performance with drummer Keith Moon, who died later that year. In 1984, Shepperton Studios changed hands coming under the control of brothers John and Benny Lee, who renovated the studios but soon lost control as a result of the \\"Black Monday\\" of 1987, the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike and internal issues within their company, Lee International. Bankers Warburg Pincus acquired the studios, which became busy with the filming of TV shows including Thomas & Friends and its sister series, TUGS, as well as such films as Franco Zeffirelli's Hamlet (1990), Kevin Reynolds' Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991) and Nicholas Hytner's The Madness of King George (1994). In 1995, the studios were purchased by a consortium headed by Ridley and Tony Scott, which led to an extensive renovation of the studios as well as the expansion and improvement of its grounds. In 2001, Shepperton Studios was sold to the Pinewood Group, which also owns Pinewood Studios in the UK, as well as Pinewood Studio Berlin in Germany, Pinewood Toronto Studios in Canada, Pinewood Indomina Studios in the Dominican Republic and Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios in Malaysia. In July 2019, Netflix announced that it would be opening a hub at the studios. Stages and locations Shepperton Studios has 15 stages, ranging in size from to , five of which are equipped with interior tanks for water and underwater filming. Although often described as the home of independent film and TV production in the UK, the studios have also served as a production base for big-budget films such as Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), the filming for which used eight of the fifteen stages. The children's TV series Thomas & Friends was shot on the \\"T Stage\\" from 1986 to 2008, after which the live action models originally used were replaced with computer animation. The nearby Little House and surrounding grounds have been used as a filming location for films such as The Omen (1976) and The Young Victoria (2009). The studios also have two large backlots, which were used to create two castle compounds for the film 47 Ronin.

Peak torque is and as with all EVs, maximum torque is available from zero rpm.Evans, Paul.\\"Mercedes Benz BlueZERO EV on show in Detroit\\", 21 January 2009. Retrieved on 2010-11-8. The BlueZERO Concept serves as a stand-alone vehicle and was a launching pad for future Mercedes-Benz hybrid vehicles. The car had a second generation and also had a sister model which was slightly larger called the B-class. Design The technology is uniformly packaged in all three BlueZERO variants. The front end is dominated by the radiator grille with its centrally located star. The aerodynamics of the BlueZERO are partly due to the closed front apron, whose design means that cooling air intakes are not required. The 20-inch wheels were also aerodynamically optimized, while the low-friction tires reduce rolling resistance. The character lines along the flanks lend the BlueZERO a dynamic side line and accentuate its nature-inspired structure. Some argue that Mercedes took a page from the BMW styling handbook with its bionic look. Rear view of the BlueZERO Concept The compact rear end of the Concept BlueZERO is characterized by its curvy tail lights. The Mercedes designers also achieved a new-quality light production: transparent lenses that produce a red light curtain which tapers towards the sides, creating a lightly diffused effect. This effect is repeated in white by the front headlamps. The front lights feature lens technology and a plexiglas edge to produce \\"C\\" shaped daytime driving lights with the help of LED headlamp technology. Translucent surfaces make the normally concealed technology visible. The light-grey tailgate is made completely from lightweight yet robust Polycarbonate that allows a view of the aluminium structure that makes up the rigidifying frame. In addition, the transparent tailgate provides a view of the vehicle interior, putting the advantages of the sandwich-floor platform in view: the luggage compartment and passenger area remain fully usable since there are no technical components that need to be accommodated there.\\"Mercedes-Benz Concept BlueZERO: Modular Drive Concept for Electric Vehicles\\" , 15 December 2008. Retrieved on 2010-11-9.  Architecture  The BlueZERO concept is based on a single architecture, a sandwich-floor architecture, which allows all of the drive components to be located on this sandwich floor design. This makes it possible to obtain a low center of mass and also leaves ample trunk and interior space. No compromises were made when it comes to passenger space or luggage capacity. With all the major power- train components located between the axles, the BlueZERO achieved a high passenger safety standard commonly associated with Mercedes. Design and vehicle dimensions are identical, in length, a payload of and a luggage compartment of over 17.6 cubic feet.Webster, Larry.\\"Mercedes Benz Concept Blue Zero Paves the Way for Alternative Powertrains: 2009 Detroit Auto Show\\", 1 October 2009.

ALU-BEAM Orange was chosen for the BlueZERO E-Cell PLUS. History The BlueZERO was a joint venture partnership project between Daimler and Evonik Industries. Daimler used the battery and hybrid ideas of Evonik Industries to produce this vehicle. Mercedes expanded upon the BlueZERO project with an updated F-Cell roadster called the B-Class in 2008-2009.Korzeniewski, Jeremy.\\"Mercedes-Benz announces small-series production of fuel-cell B-Class\\", 30 April 2009.

The Mercedes-Benz B-Class Electric Drive sales started worldwide in 2014, using a lithium-ion battery pack from Tesla Motors. Environmental impact The Mercedes-Benz BlueZERO has a minimal, almost absent carbon footprint. The BlueZERO is similar to many other hybrid vehicles in the fact that it achieves lower emissions and greater fuel economy than its internal combustion engine vehicle counterparts. These environmental gains are achieved by using its electric motor and fuel cell combined to optimize peak power or fuel economy depending on the mode the car is set on. The batteries are also capable of recharging in stop and go traffic due to the on-board engine-generator in the F-Cell. The BlueZERO is also able to save energy by shutting down its electric motor when it is stopped.

Geography  The region of Dragoyna is located where the Maritsa valley merges with the high mountains of the Rhodopes. The Dragoyna peak has two summits - Golyama (Big) and Malka (Little) Dragoyna, with an attitude difference of some . They are connected by a saddle. As the highest point in the region, the peak has an extensive view.  Population  According to the 2011 census, the village of Dragoyna has 359 inhabitants. Out of Rhode, 352 are ethnic Bulgarians, while the other 7 people did not state their ethnicity.  History  The name of the village until 1906 was Kozluk. In the 5th century BC, the powerful Odrysian kingdom was established in the Maritsa valley. The kingdom survived for centuries. The region of Dragoyna was probably a local centre of the Thracian aristocracy within the Odrysian kingdom. A high concentration of Thracian tumuli has been registered in the area. A golden ring has been found in Ezerovo near Dragoyna bearing an inscription that is thought to be in Thracian using the Greek alphabet. It indicates that the owners of the ring dedicated it to their deceased relatives. A settlement, most probably related to the sanctuary, was located close to the modern village of Dragoynovo. In the 1st century AD this part of Thrace was added to the Roman Empire, and later it remained a part of its eastern half, the Byzantine Empire. It is known that a town centre, fortifications and churches from the Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages existed in the region. Probably in this period the legend ‚Äì about queen Dragoyna ‚Äì was made up.  Culture and nature  A Thracian sanctuary was discovered on Dragoyna Peak in 2004. The highest part of the peak of Golyama Dragoyna ‚Äì an area of about 2 dka ‚Äì is surrounded by a stone wall, which can be seen on the surface as stone ruins four to ten metres in width. The ruins consist largely of local stones with irregular shape, together with some large dressed stone blocks. A concentration of artifacts has been registered on the surface and in the treasure hunters' \\"trenches\\" within the area, surrounded by the stone wall as well as north of the stone wall. Pottery and treasure hunters' digs can be found also in an area of about 1 dka in the saddle between Golyama and Malka Dragoyna, where one of the ways to the peak is located. Traces of an ancient road are visible on the eastern slopes of the peak, which offers the shortest way to the site. Some artifacts have been registered on the southeast slopes. The artifact mapping suggests that they were part of the road.

The dish is traditionally made with glutinous rice cooked in coconut milk with various slices of sab√° bananas, taro, and sweet potato, among other ingredients. It is comparable to various dessert guinata√°n (coconut milk-based) dishes found in other regions such as bilo-bilo. Among the Visayan people, the dish is traditionally served during Good Friday of Holy Week. Names Binignit is also called gin√°-tan in Bikolano, tabir√°k in Mindanao Cebuano, alpahor in Chavacano, ginetta√°n' in Ilokano, ginat-an (or ginat-ang lugaw) in Waray and Hiligaynon/Ilonggo, kamlo in western Iloilo, scramble in Tuguegarao City, linugaw in Bacolod, and eangkuga by Akeanons in Aklan. Binignit is considered a type of lugaw (rice gruel) and guinata√°n (dishes cooked in coconut milk). Preparation The meat of a mature coconut is grated and the \\"thick\\" milk (coconut cream) is extracted. Two cups of water are then added to the grated coconut, and a second extraction is made. This becomes the \\"thin\\" milk. This \\"thin\\" coconut milk extract is added to cubed kamote (sweet potato), gabi (taro) and ube (purple yam), sliced ripe sab√° bananas, langka (jack fruit), and tapioca pearls. Sometimes, young coconut meat strips are also added. This is simmered on low to medium heat, to prevent the coconut milk from curdling. Glutinous rice (pilit) is added once the root crops have sufficiently softened and the mixture is brought to a boil; being stirred occasionally until done. Just before removal from the flame, the \\"thick\\" coconut milk is added. The people of the neighboring island of Leyte use ingredients such as landang (palm flour jelly balls), jackfruit, and anise, and thicken it with milled glutinous rice. The vegetables and the pearl sago are cooked in a mixture of water, coconut milk and landang, and sweetened by muscovado or brown sugar. For the people of Panay, their version contains balls made of glutinous flour, as well as jackfruit. The balls are formed and boiled until they float, indicating that they are cooked. These are then added to the linugaw or eangkuga. This is similar to the preparation of bilo-bilo but the locals call it by eangkuga or linugaw. Cultural significance A popular afternoon snack, it is best served when hot. Others serve it chilled or even frozen, eating the dessert much like ice cream. Among the Visayan people, the soup is also widely cooked and eaten for the Holy Week, especially during Good Friday when observant Catholics fast and avoid meat.

In two dimensions it is also possible to consider perfect negative dependence, which is called countermonotonicity. Comonotonicity is also related to the comonotonic additivity of the Choquet integral. The concept of comonotonicity has applications in financial risk management and actuarial science, see e.g. and . In particular, the sum of the components is the riskiest if the joint probability distribution of the random vector is comonotonic. Furthermore, the -quantile of the sum equals of the sum of the -quantiles of its components, hence comonotonic random variables are quantile-additive. In practical risk management terms it means that there is minimal (or eventually no) variance reduction from diversification. For extensions of comonotonicity, see and .

Biography  Kownacka was born on 11 September 1894 in S≈Çup, partitioned Poland. She became a village schoolteacher at the age of 18, teaching in Dƒôbowa G√≥ra in 1914. From 1915 to 1918 she worked as a teacher in Minsk, where she also studied literature. As she was teaching in Polish, her activities were considered part of the illegal underground activism. It is around that time she also begun her career as a writer. Later she founded her own school in Krzywda on land owned by a relative. As she did not have sufficient funds to buy books, she wrote down her own stories for the children. In 1919 she debuted as a writer, with her first work published in magazines for children, P≈Çomyk and P≈Çomyczek. Due to a disease of the throat, she was forced to abandon her budding career as a teacher. She moved to Warsaw where she worked as a librarian in the Ministry of Agricultural Reforms and was an educational activist for children, active in the . In 1931 she moved to a house in ≈ªolib√≥rz, which would later become a museum dedicated to her. Also that year she published the first part of her best known work, ', in P≈Çomyk (lit. the Diary of a Plasteline Man, about the adventures of a small red character made out of plastelne). It would be published in the book form in 1936 and would become one of the classics of Polish children's literature, and part of the Polish elementary school curriculum. By 1939 she published eight books, including collections of short stories for children Bajowe bajeczki i ≈õwierszczykowe skrzypeczki, czyli o straszliwym smoku i dzielnym szewczyku, prze≈õlicznej kr√≥lewnie i kr√≥lu Gwo≈∫dziku (1935), Kukuryku na rƒôczniku (1936) and a stage play Cztery mile za piƒôƒá (1937).

This generation, the first to grow up entirely within the reformist era, currently ranges in age from to , making up a major portion of China's young adult demographic. Etymology In English, this group is also sometimes called China's Generation Y after the use of the term in the book China‚Äôs Generation Y by Michael Stanat in 2005 (though he references the dates 1981‚Äì1995). *People born in other periods are also named in the same way in Mainland China. :The Post-'70 is used to describe Chinese people born in the 1970s. :The Post-'90 (‰πùÈõ∂Âêé) means people born from 1990 to 1999 in urban areas. They are usually concerted to brain-disabled characters and non-mainstream culture. This generation has similar traits to post-'80 such as being open to premarital sex, but to an even greater degree. It also has a much larger male surplus population than the post-80s, who already have a significant gap between the male and female population. As birth rates rapidly fell between 1990 and 1991 following the Tiananmen Square massacre this cohort is much smaller than the post-80s generation. :The Pre-'60 (ÂÖ≠Èõ∂Ââç) means people born before the year 1960. It is a generation of approximately 240 million people born between 1980 and 1990, although characteristics of the after-eighty generation have also been seen in those born in the 1990s. Growing up in modern China, this generation has been characterized by its optimism for the future, newfound excitement for consumerism, entrepreneurship, and acceptance of its historic role in transforming modern China into an economic superpower. These people are also distinguished by their increased access to digital media such as computers, MP3 players and mobile phones. Post-'80ers in China often experience a palpable generation gap between them and their elders; while their parents lived during the Mao Zedong era, experienced famine and political instability and lack proper education because of the policies set forth under the Cultural Revolution, they live in an environment of tremendous economic growth and social change, high technology, and rigorous education standards. There is also a significant generation gap between them and Post-'90, who are even more thoroughly entrenched in digitality and capitalism. A clash between tradition and modern influences is noticeable in purchasing habits, career pursuits, and daily interaction between child and elders. Furthermore, young adults have been indirectly affected by forced government shutdowns of thousands of Internet bars each year that prevent the excessive use of the Internet. Young people are also affected by China's large socioeconomic divide between urban and rural residents and societal problems resulting from modernization. Future The Post-'80 generation illuminates important questions not only about China's future but also those of the United States and the global economy. Several factors that may influence the generation are individualism, consumerism, modernization, and technology. \\"Little emperors\\" When parents over-indulge their only child, who has no siblings as a result of the One Child Policy, the indulged children may be referred to as \\"little emperors\\" (xiaohuangdi Â∞èÁöáÂ∏ù). Many Chinese families have the 4-2-1 format: 4 grandparents, 2 parents, one child. Parents and grandparents eat less and spend less money on themselves, only so the youngster could feel physically and mentally strong, focus on one's studies and be successful later on in life.Vanessa L. Fong. Only Hope: Coming of Age Under China's One-Child Policy. Stanford University Press, 2004, 256 pp. Almost all Chinese families usually adopt a set of traditional Confucian values when raising their only child. Because Confucianism considers Ren (‰ªÅ; love and social responsibility) the core emotion that develops moral conceptions into genuine personal motivation, a child who has received too much familial attention but also endured high mental and physical restrictions because the economic future of the family depends on their academic success directly leads to a situation that is often considered in academic and popular discourse as over-indulging the children, in opposition to concepts of Ren and filial piety (Â≠ù; xiao). There is substantial evidence that many young Chinese feel a heavy burdenPsychological problems in the post-'90 generation (Chinese; 90ÂêéÊòìÂá∫Áé∞ÁöÑÂøÉÁêÜÈóÆÈ¢ò) - Psychology Center of Shandong Normal University and a huge responsibility towards their parents, understanding that their performances in school or other domains can be of crucial consequences towards their family. Depending on the specific family conditions and children's mental healthy condition, this burden could lead to a diligent lifestyle by youngsters or to a more rebellious attitude to traditional Confucian codes or not being able to cope with such pressure nor develop self-discipline.Chinese Singletons - Basic ‚ÄòSpoiled‚Äô Related Vocabulary, Thinking Chinese, September 2010. While being nurtured by parents and relatives gives children some clear advantages and opportunities, the fact that a child doesn't have siblings who 'compete' with him or her in a younger age could also lead to some psychological difficulties as the child grows. \\"Lacking adapting capabilities\\" () is a description which is commonly associated with the new post-'80 generation. Since such children don't need to put any efforts in order to gain parents' attention or to win family resources, they develop no competitive abilities and have weak social skills once they are older and need to be self-sufficient. Traditionally seen as a rite of passage, marriage has been linked as milestones to adulthood. Yet, the Chinese millennials are late bloomers when it comes to marriage. Although some members of the millennials are well in their 30s, statistics show they are still living their lives as bachelors or bachelorettes. Having grown up in times of modern consumerism and popular media, rather than the ideals of the Cultural Revolution, many single-children are inclined to spend large amounts of money on themselves and thus are a cornerstone of retail sales.NHK World, Japan 7 Days, Matter of Fact: \\"Cause for Celebration\\" aired February 20, 2010. Families which are well-off economically sometimes allow their children to indulge in the new materialistic sphere, while poorer families often still make efforts to keep their children inside the consumers' race, allowing them to purchase new clothes, new cell-phone brands, etc. Post-'80 in Hong Kong Post-'80 in Hong Kong and the after-eighty generation in mainland China are for the most part different.Post 80s rebels with a cause , The Standard, Coleen Lee, 15 Jan 2010, Accessed 20 Jun 2010 The term Post-'80 () came into use in Hong Kong between 2009 and 2010, particularly during the course of the opposition to the Guangzhou-Hong Kong Express Rail Link, during which a group of young activists came to the forefront of the Hong Kong political scene.Kwong wing-yuen (ed.), Zhan zai dan de yi bian, Xianggang bashihou, Hong Kong, UP Publications Limited, 2010, pp. 16-32. They are said to be \\"post-materialist\\" in outlook, and they are particularly vocal in issues such as urban development, culture and heritage, and political reform. Their campaigns include the fight for the preservation of Lee Tung Street, the Star Ferry Pier and the Queen's Pier, Choi Yuen Tsuen Village, real political reform (on June 23), and a citizen-oriented West Kowloon Cultural District. Their discourse mainly develops around themes such as anti-colonialism, sustainable development, and democracy. Post-'80 in Canada According to the Canadian Census, among the population that was never married, there was a large increase in the proportions for those in their 20s and 30s in 2011 in comparison to 1981. For young adults aged 25 to 29, the proportion who were never married increased from 26.0% of the population in 1981 to close to 73.1% in 2011. Even among individuals in their early 30s, the proportion of men who were never married increased from 15.0% in 1981 to 54.0% in 2011. For women, the increase was from 10.5% in 1981 to 43.4% in 2011.

(1993) The Icelandic Homily Book : Perg. 15o in the Royal Library, Stockholm Reykjav√≠k: Stofnun √Årna Magn√∫ssonar √° √çslandi, p. 32 There are numerous marginal entries; some contemporary with the manuscript and others dating from the 16th ‚Äì 19th centuries. There are a number of very early alterations to the manuscript which appear to date from a controversy between Theodor Wis√©n, the text's first editor, and Ludvig Larsson, who published a study which contained nearly 2000 corrections of Wis√©n‚Äôs edition.de Leeuw van Weenen, A. (1993) The Icelandic Homily Book : Perg. 15o in the Royal Library, Stockholm Reykjav√≠k: Stofnun √Årna Magn√∫ssonar √° √çslandi, p. 5 Linbald (1975) concluded that in almost 1200 instances Larsson‚Äôs readings were correct and in around 150 cases, his readings were incorrect.de Leeuw van Weenen, A.

Page 77v has three drawings: two lions engraved by dry-point and an ink drawing of a man pointing with his hand. The clearest lion is of Romanesque-type and has been dated to the first part of the 13th century. There has been much debate concerning the number of hands involved in the writing of the manuscript, with opinions ranging from 1 to 14.de Leeuw van Weenen, A. (1993) The Icelandic Homily Book : Perg. 15o in the Royal Library, Stockholm Reykjav√≠k: Stofnun √Årna Magn√∫ssonar √° √çslandi, p. 32-3 The two most recent studies quoted by van Leuwen, (Rode 1974) and (Westlund 1974) place the number of hands at 14 and 12 respectively.de Leeuw van Weenen, A. (1993) The Icelandic Homily Book : Perg. 15o in the Royal Library, Stockholm Reykjav√≠k: Stofnun √Årna Magn√∫ssonar √° √çslandi, p. 33 Van Leuwen states that she is drawn to there being only one hand involved.de Leeuw van Weenen, A. (1993) The Icelandic Homily Book : Perg. 15o in the Royal Library, Stockholm Reykjav√≠k: Stofnun √Årna Magn√∫ssonar √° √çslandi, p. 34 Stef√°n Karlsson similarly holds this view. Contents The OIHB is principally distinct from the Old Norwegian Homily Book (ONHB) in that unlike the latter it is not arranged according to the church year. The source material for the OIHB has been traced to a number of the Church Fathers, though a full study of the sources has yet to be carried out. However, the OIHB also made use of material available in other homiliaries. For example, it contains a close translation a sermon included in the ‚ÄúPembroke-type homilary‚Äù: a Carolingian preacher‚Äôs anthology. The style of the OIHB is closer to that of the √çslendingas√∂gur than the Latinate vocabulary and syntax of later Old West Norse religious prose. It makes use of abrupt changes in tense and from indirect to direct speech, particularly in paraphrases of the gospels. It occasionally uses ‚Äúnative proverbs and everyday similitudes‚Äù which contribute to its simple, practical style. However, rhetorical devices are sometimes used to achieve a high style and some sentences can be scanned as verse. Of the 11 sermons in the OIHB and ONHB have in common, two are found in what is possibly the oldest Icelandic manuscript fragment, AM 237a fol: dated to 1150. These texts are the ‚ÄòStave-church Homily‚Äô and a sermon for St. Michael‚Äôs Day. Indreb√∏ has shown that the 11 sermons in common are copies of copies, at least. Similarly, he concluded that AM 237a fol is a copy of a copy, and was itself probably a remnant of a homiliary itself.de Leeuw van Weenen, A. (1993) The Icelandic Homily Book : Perg. 15o in the Royal Library, Stockholm Reykjav√≠k: Stofnun √Årna Magn√∫ssonar √° √çslandi, p. 19 This implies that at least some material in the manuscript belongs to before 1150. As well as sermons found in the ONHB and AM 237a fol, some sermons feature in other Old Norse manuscripts such as Hauksb√≥k.de Leeuw van Weenen, A.

His essays, written under the alias \\"Alpha of the Plough\\", are highly regarded. He was also Chairman of the National Anti-Sweating League, an advocacy group which campaigned for a minimum wage in industry. Early life Gardiner was born in Chelmsford, the son of Henry James Gardiner, a cabinet-maker and alcoholic, and his wife, Susanna Taylor.Essex, England, Select Church of England Parish Registers, 1518-1960 As a boy he worked at the Chelmsford Chronicle and the Bournemouth Directory. He joined the Northern Daily Telegraph in 1887 which had been founded the year before by Thomas Purvis Ritzema. In 1899, he was appointed editor of the Blackburn Weekly Telegraph. Editor of the Daily News In 1902 Ritzema was named general manager of the Daily News. Needing an editor, he turned to his young prot√©g√© to fill the role. The choice soon proved a great success; under Gardiner's direction, it became one of the leading liberal journals its day, as he improved its coverage of both the news and literary matters while crusading against social injustices. Yet while circulation rose from 80,000 when he joined the paper to 151,000 in 1907 and 400,000 with the introduction of a Manchester edition in 1909, the paper continued to run at a loss. Though close to the owner of the Daily News, George Cadbury, Gardiner resigned in 1919 over a disagreement with him over Gardiner's opposition to David Lloyd George. Essayist From 1915 he contributed to The Star under the pseudonym Alpha of the Plough. At the time The Star had several anonymous essayists whose pseudonyms were the names of stars. Invited to choose the name of a star as a pseudonym he chose the name of the brightest (alpha) star in the constellation \\"the Plough.\\" His essays are uniformly elegant, graceful and humorous. His uniqueness lay in his ability to teach the basic truths of life in an easy and amusing manner. The collections Pillars of Society, Pebbles on the Shore, Many Furrows and Leaves in the Wind are some of his best-known writings. A reviewer of Pebbles on the Shore said Gardiner wrote with \\"fluency, deftness, lightness, grace, and usually a very real sparkle\\". The end of the essay \\"The Vanity of Old Age\\" is typically neat: \\"For Nature is a cunning nurse. She gives us lollipops all the way, and when the lollipop of hope and the lollipop of achievement are done, she gently inserts in our toothless gums the lollipop of remembrance. And with that pleasant vanity we are soothed to sleep.\\"Alpha of the Plough, \\"The Vanity of Old Age\\", Windfalls, J.M. Dent & Sons Ltd., London, 1920, p. 17.

It is run out of the University of Pennsylvania's Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology and funded by both private donors and the National Endowment for the Humanities. The project began under the direction of √Öke W. Sj√∂berg (1924-2014) and Erle Leichty in 1974 and was modeled on the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary, itself begun in 1921. In 1976 it received its first federal funds from the National Endowment for the Humanities, and in 1984 published its first section for the letter B; only 750 copies were originally printed, but more were soon published as the first batch sold out surprisingly quickly at US$40 a piece. As of 1989 Sj√∂berg was still project director, and despite retiring in 1996 continued to contribute. In 1991 Steve Tinney joined the project, and several years later decided to reconfigure the project from an envisioned 18-volume series into an online electronic dictionary that could be progressively updated. The new, online format was named the \\"electronic Pennsylvania Sumerian Dictionary,\\" or ePSD. Many shorter definitions were added as opposed to the original format of long entries in the printed A and B volumes. The data sets from several other projects attempting to put Sumerian texts in electronic form on the Internet are expected to be eventually integrated into the dictionary project. In July 2002, Tinney became the project's director. As of April 2002 the project had received a new two-year US $302,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, though Tinney subsequently stated that because the dictionary project had changed into more of a process with no end date, they could no longer ask for federal funds, and instead would try to establish two permanent research positions for the dictionary with US$3,000,000 in donations.

ONC's mission is looking ahead as it begins its second decade in 2014. ONC is working to improve these five areas:''' *Adoption: increase end user adoption of electronic health records and health IT to capture and use the information *Standards: establish standards so the various technologies can speak to each other *Incentives: provide the right incentives for the market to drive financial and clinical advances *Privacy and security: make sure protected (personal) health information remains private and secure *Governance: provide governance and structure for the exchange of health information The concerted initiative on interoperability in 2014 seeks to achieve the ability of two or more systems to exchange health information and use the information once it is received. The mission of ONC is to optimize the paths to reach these five health IT goals along with interoperability to support the Triple Aim. Widely adopted by the healthcare sector, the Triple Aim was developed by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement to 1) improve patient experience of care, 2) improve the health of populations, and 3) reduce per capita costs of healthcare. ''' The Federal Health IT Strategic Plan from 2011-2015 had set these five goals''' *Achieve adoption and information exchange through meaningful use of health IT *Improve care, improve population health, and reduce healthcare costs through the use of health IT *Inspire confidence and trust in health IT *Empower individuals with health IT to improve their health and the health care system *Achieve rapid learning and technological advancement In its ongoing work, ONC is looking to address these priorities in 2014: *Evolve from ARRA structure of the ONC *Federal HIT Strategic Plan *Develop national consensus agenda *Health information exchange, use and infrastructure a priority focus *Meaningful use *Advance health IT tools in support of the Triple Aim ONC's mission had previously been described as *Promoting development of a nationwide HIT infrastructure that allows for electronic use and exchange of information that: **Ensures secure and protected patient health information **Improves health care quality **Reduces health care costs **Informs medical decisions at the time/place of care **Includes meaningful public input in infrastructure development **Improves coordination of care and information among hospitals, labs, physicians, etc. **Improves public health activities and facilitates early identification/rapid response to public health emergencies **Facilitates health and clinical research **Promotes early detection, prevention, and management of chronic diseases **Promotes a more effective marketplace **Improves efforts to reduce health disparities *Providing leadership in the development, recognition, and implementation of standards and the certification of HIT products; *Health IT policy coordination; *Strategic planning for HIT adoption and health information exchange; and *Establishing governance for the Nationwide Health Information Network. Leadership The structure of the agency offers insight into its strategic goals, and the agency's continued interest in collaborative, transparent, experienced leadership.

Programs The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act seeks to improve American health care delivery and patient care through an unprecedented investment in health information technology. The provisions of the HITECH Act are specifically designed to work together to provide the necessary assistance and technical support to providers, enable coordination and alignment within and among states, establish connectivity to the public health community in case of emergencies, and assure the workforce is properly trained and equipped to be meaningful users of Electronic Health Records (EHRs). EHR Incentive Program Payments and Meaningful Use The HITECH Act set meaningful use of interoperable EHR adoption in the health care system as a critical national goal and incentivized EHR adoption. The \\"goal is not adoption alone but 'meaningful use' of EHRs ‚Äî that is, their use by providers to achieve significant improvements in care.\\" The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) managed and distributed these federal funds for the meaningful use of electronic health records in conjunction with state Medicaid departments with the cooperation and support of ONC and ONC programs. As of March 2014, more than $22.5 billion in combined Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Program payments have been made since 2011. More than $14.8 billion in Medicare EHR Incentive Program payments have been made between May 2011 and March 2014. More than $7.7 billion in Medicaid EHR Incentive Program payments have been made between January 2011 (when the first set of states launched their programs) and March 2014. More than 470,000 eligible professionals, eligible hospitals, and critical access hospitals are actively registered in the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs as of March 2014. According to Modern Healthcare, payments have been made to 90.4% of the 5,011 estimated eligible hospitals; and 69.6% of the estimated 527,200 eligible professionals. ONC Programs The following ONC programs help to build the foundation for every American to benefit from an electronic health record, as part of a modernized, interconnected, and vastly improved system of care delivery. Note: The list of programs below is in the process of being revised and updated. *Health Information Technology Extension Program: A grant program to establish Health Information Technology Regional Extension Centers (RECs) to offer technical assistance, guidance and information on best practices to support and accelerate health care providers‚Äô efforts to become meaningful users of Electronic Health Records (EHRs). While RECs are no longer technically funded by ONC, many of these former grantees have no-cost extensions which allows them to spend whatever is left in their respective grants, as well as find ways to continue their work. The REC program goals were to enroll 100,000 Primary Care Providers (PCPs) in the REC program, help them go \\"live\\" on EHRs, and help them demonstrate Meaningful Use. As of January 2014, 136,303 PCPs were enrolled, 123,770 went \\"live,\\" and 85,106 had demonstrated Meaningful Use. RECs were also encouraged to reach out to all providers, not only PCPs. Among all providers, 149,315 enrolled with RECs, 132,989 went \\"live\\" on EHRs, and 89,299 demonstrated Meaningful Use. ONC continues to partner with these former grantees. *State Health Information Exchange Cooperative Agreement Program: A grant program to support States or State Designated Entities (SDEs) in establishing health information exchange (HIE) capability among healthcare providers and hospitals in their jurisdictions. This program was initially envisioned to support query-based health information exchange programs in each state and territory (56 entities in all). The program transitioned into a mixture of query-based and directed exchange programs in order to support the implementation of Meaningful Use. Meaningful Use required healthcare professionals and hospitals to share authorized health information with each other as well as to send receive lab and prescription information with test labs and pharmacies respectively. ONC also issued challenge grants to those participating in the program to encourage breakthrough innovations for health information exchange that could be leveraged widely to support nationwide health information exchange and interoperability. The challenge grants sought to develop innovative and scalable solutions in five key areas: 1) achieving health goals through health information exchange, 2) improving long-term and post-acute care transitions, 3) consumer-mediated information exchange, 4) enabling enhanced query for patient care, and 5) fostering distributed population-level analytics. As of Quarter 3 of 2013, 44 states/territories had directed exchange broadly available, with another 6 reporting regional or piloted programs. As of Quarter 3 of 2013, 32 states/territories had operational query-based exchange broadly available statewide through single or multiple services/entities, 8 had query-based exchange broadly available in regions but not statewide, and 16 did not have operational query-based exchange options available. ONC is continuing to partner with these state entities. *Strategic Health IT Advanced Research Projects (SHARP) Program: A grant program to fund research focused on achieving breakthrough advances to address well-documented problems that have impeded adoption: **Security of Health Information Technology **Patient-Centered Cognitive Support **Healthcare Application and Network Platform Architectures **Secondary Use of EHR Data *Beacon Community Program: A grant program for communities to build and strengthen their health information technology (health IT) infrastructure and exchange capabilities. These communities will demonstrate the vision of a future where hospitals, clinicians, and patients are meaningful users of health IT, and together the community achieves measurable improvements in health care quality, safety, efficiency, and population health. According to a March 2013 Evaluation, \\"The Beacon Communities have implemented a wide variety of interventions, including innovations in care delivery, provider feedback and performance measurement initiatives, health IT development projects, and tools to improve the process of care for providers and consumers. Each Beacon Community has tailored its activities to reflect its unique resources, goals, and populations, resulting in a broad range of activities. In many cases, the Communities have chosen to focus all or some of their efforts on specific disease categories.\\" While Beacon programs are no longer technically funded by ONC, many of these former grantees have no-cost extensions which allows them to spend whatever is left in their respective grants, as well as find ways to continue their work. ONC continues to partner with these former grantees. *Health IT Workforce Training Programs *Community College Consortia to Educate Health Information Technology Professionals Program: A grant program that seeks to rapidly create health IT education and training programs at Community Colleges or expand existing programs. Community Colleges funded under this initiative will establish intensive, non-degree training programs that can be completed in six months or less. This is one component of the Health IT Workforce Program. *Program of Assistance for University-Based Training: A grant program to rapidly increase the availability of individuals qualified to serve in specific health information technology professional roles requiring university-level training. This is one component of the Health IT Workforce Program. *Combined Results of Community College and University-Based Training: In total the two programs trained 21,437 students from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands at 91 academic institutions. *Curriculum Development Centers Program: A grant program to provide $10 million in grants to institutions of higher education (or consortia thereof) to support health information technology (health IT) curriculum development. This is one component of the Health IT Workforce Program. *Competency Examination for Individuals Completing Non-Degree Training Program: A grant program to provide $6 million in grants to an institution of higher education (or consortia thereof) to support the development and initial administration of a set of health IT competency examinations. This is one component of the Health IT Workforce Program. Advisory committees ONC also created two Federal Advisory Committees (FACAs), the Health IT Policy Committee, which the National Coordinator chairs, and the Health IT Standards Committee. Health IT Policy Committee The Health IT Policy Committee recommends a policy framework for the development and adoption of a nationwide health information technology infrastructure that permits the electronic exchange and use of health information. Vice-chair of this committee is Paul Tang, MD, MS, who is Vice President, Chief Innovation and Technology Officer at Palo Alto Medical Foundation. Health IT Standards Committee The Health IT Standards Committee recommends to the National Coordinator standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria. The Standards Committee also harmonizes, pilot tests, and ensures consistency with the Social Security Act. Vice-chair of this committee is John Halamka, MD, MS, who is Chief Information Officer of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Professor at Harvard Medical School, and a practicing Emergency Physician.

She was introduced in the pilot episode by executive producer Alan Bateman. Nearly four hundred actresses auditioned to play Bobby, with Dickson taking the role. Bobby is described as a trouble-making teen who is rebellious and a loner. Bobby became a popular character because of her confronting attitude. Bobby's story lines have focused on finding her biological parents, her feud with Roo Stewart, adoption and her marriage to foster brother Frank Morgan. Bobby's marriage to Frank was only implemented when script writers were sure viewers approved of it. At certain points in Bobby's duration, Dickson disapproved of her actions, for instance she became frustrated with her because she decided to find her biological parents without thinking about her foster parents' feelings. Dickson decided to leave the serial in 1993, and the character was killed off in a boat accident. In 1995 Dickson made a cameo appearance when Ailsa Stewart has hallucinations of Bobby in her fridge door. Dickson has received a Logie Award for her portrayal of Bobby and she has been referred to as a \\"Summer Bay icon\\". Casting Nearly four hundred actresses auditioned for the role of Bobby, compared to the three hundred hopefuls that auditioned for the roles of the other foster children, with actress Nicolle Dickson receiving the role of Bobby. Dickson was eighteen when she was cast and had nearly decided to quit acting in favour of a \\"normal career\\". Initially Dickson found the role hard to adjust to because she never got to see her friends any more and has stated she found it odd that the serial's production staff were having her transported around on first-class flights and in limousines. The fame also took Dickson by surprise, whilst interviewed by newspaper Evening Times she stated: \\"I'm just an ordinary teenage girl but my life changed completely almost over-night. When I started playing the role of Bobby I had no idea of the effect it was going to have.\\" Dickson has also revealed that fans are scared to talk to her because they assume she will act like Bobby, stating: \\"I sometimes think people are scared to talk to me, because I might bite their head off. But I'd much rather just have a chat.\\" In 1991, it was revealed that Dickson has signed another years contract to stay with Home and Away but said she was \\"nervous\\" about doing so. After Dickson's exit the remaining older cast members were offered pay rises because Seven feared they would follow her decision to quit. Character development The serial's writers of 1989 stated that: \\"Bobby Simpson is Summer Bay's premiere juvenile delinquent - the product of sixteen years of emotional rejection by her parents, and later, grandparents.\\" They also brand her a loner, streetwise and describe her attitude in her early years stating: \\"If she liked you she'd do anything for you, if she had an anti against you she was a little demon who'd only stop short of crime in her actions towards you.\\" Further describing these traits Dickson adds: \\"She'll stick by you to the end, but then she can turn around and stick her fingers up at you if she doesn't like you. I think a lot of people can relate to the way Bobby is. [...] I enjoy playing her, I think she's really sweet because she puts on this tough exterior and yet inside she's longing for somebody. Bobby has little control over the others.\\" Dickson also believes that Bobby's popularity stems from the fact she does the things people in real life wish they could do but are not brave enough to. Dickson has also described why Bobby hides behind a tough exterior stating she is so aggressive because she is hurt inside. In the Home and Away Annual for 1989 Kesta Desmond writes that she is a loner, a juvenile delinquent, a rebel and forthright. In the book Home and Away Special she is described as: \\"Bobby is a loner, she has very few friends, only the tearaways of the town, and claims to need nobody.\\" Describing the similarities between character and actress Dickson adds: \\"I think I'm more independent and mature. She is afraid to trust anyone, but I love affection.\\" One of Bobby's storylines saw her try and track down her real father, the plot was unpopular with Dickson who stated: \\"When Bobby turned her back on her foster parents to go off and look for her real father, I just became totally frustrated with her.\\" Another storyline was her relationship with foster brother Frank Morgan (Alex Papps), they get together after Roo Stewart (Justine Clarke) leaves him on their wedding day. Dickson describes the fan reaction stating: \\"They're all on Bobby's side, and clearly not Roo's!\\" On-screen Bobby is constantly worried that she is a substitute for Roo, of this Dickson states: \\"The character of Bobby has always felt intimidated by Roo because she's so beautiful and sexy. She knows Frank has always fancied Roo and can't help suspecting that he's marrying Bobby on the rebound\\". Papps said that Bobby \\"still had a lot of attitude\\" but by then she had \\"softened a lot.\\" Dickson had to film many scenes around this time which involved Bobby crying with worry, she stated she found the scenes easy to prepare for. When script writers initially planned Bobby and Frank's wedding, but they were unsure how viewers would react to it. Dickson and Papps were sent on a publicity stunt to find out what the public reaction would be to the proposed marriage. They stood in a crowded shopping centre and hugged each other, which got the crowds attention as they cheered, Papps then shouted: \\"Let's have a scream from those who want Bobby and Frank to marry\\". The crowd heavily approved and all voiced their approval. Delighted producers gave the marriage the green light and they married. Dickson later stated: \\"Everyone wanted to sort of see them finally get together because Bobby was keen on him for such a long time.\\" Concluding that their marriage served as relief to everyone because Bobby finally got her happy ending. In 1990, Bobby discovers she is pregnant. Though in the 1991 series return episode, Bobby is told she has miscarried her unborn baby. Dickson said the scenes were \\"very harrowing\\". Bobby tries \\"to keep calm\\" throughout her ordeal. In a March 1995, a TV Week reporter revealed that Dickson had reprised the role of Bobby. While her character was killed off, Bobby would return in scenes to coincide with a planned mental breakdown for the character of Ailsa Hogan (Judy Nunn). Storylines Backstory Bobby was born in Summer Bay as the illegitimate daughter of Morag Bellingham (Cornelia Frances) and Donald Fisher (Norman Coburn). Morag kept the pregnancy a secret. She was adopted by Doris and Al Simpson (George Leppard; Terence Donovan), who she moved with to the city when she was two years old. Al was a violent alcoholic was imprisoned seven years for petty crime. Meanwhile, Doris and Bobby returned to Summer Bay to stay with her grandparents. By this point, Bobby had begun rebelling and earned a reputation as a wild child. When she was fifteen, her mother Doris died of cancer, and her grandparents sold their store to Ailsa. Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher) soon felt sympathy for her and got her a job at the store and allowed her to live behind his boatshed, she resented Alf being an authority figure to her but slowly warmed to Ailsa. 1988‚Äì1995 Tom (Roger Oakley) and Pippa Fletcher (Vanessa Downing) arrive with their foster children to take a look at the caravan park, Bobby is hiding in one in of the vans with the help of Neville (Frank Lloyd) and Floss McPhee (Sheila Kennelly), after being accused of breaking into Donald Fisher's house. Neville and Floss try to keep her away from Alf and the Fletchers, as they do not want any more trouble. Bobby sees Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie) snooping, Bobby tries to make an escape but knocks over little Sally in the process. Bobby tries to get Sally to keep quiet and runs off. She is later caught by Tom and Frank when Sally identifies the girl who pushed her, and is placed under citizens arrest by Fisher who has been searching for her due to his suspicions about her robbing him. She is then handed over to the police. Bobby decides to harass the Fletcher girls at the beach and blames their family for her earlier arrest. The night the Fletchers move into the caravan park house, one of the vans burst into flames. The blame is immediately pointed at Bobby, but she is adamant she has done anything wrong. Fisher tries to have her arrested again as he wants to see justice, but Tom and Pippa refuse to press charges as they believe Bobby is innocent. Pippa starts to feel sorry for Bobby and offers her a chance to live in one of the caravans free of charge, which Bobby refuses, as she does not want to be seen as anyone's charity case. However, Steven Matheson (Adam Willits), comes to her defence when she is harassed by Lance Smart (Peter Vroom) and Martin Dibble (Craig Thomson) on the beach. Bobby soon befriends Steven and as a result she decides to accept Pippa's offer. But Carly Morris (Sharyn Hodgson), objects to Bobby staying in the caravan park and a fight breaks out between them just as a man from community services stops by to assess the Fletchers living arrangements. Bobby feels guilty that she might be responsible for splitting the family up, so she goes to the city to convince Tarquin Pearce (John O'Brien), the man from the department not to take the kids away from Tom and Pippa. Pearce is so impressed with what Bobby told him, he not only wants the Fletchers to stay together, he also persuades Tom and Pippa to take on Bobby as their sixth foster child. She later moves in with them and quickly settles in and becomes a part of the family. Now reformed and living in a stable home, Bobby and Ailsa decide to set up a new business, The Bayside Diner. She also develops feelings for her foster brother Frank, but he is in love with Roo. Bobby and Roo clash on many occasions, whilst Bobby is secretly jealous. Bobby evens starts dreaming she is marrying Frank and rubbing it in Roo's face. Bobby is delighted when Roo and Frank seem to be having a rough time.

So after constant disagreements, Frank decides to leave Summer Bay for New York City to reconcile with Roo. Bobby is distraught to realise she was right all along. She attempts to trace her birth parents, without giving a thought for her foster parents' feelings. After a series of hurdles, Bobby decides she has tried hard enough and gives up. Morag is admitted to hospital and Alf decides to tell Bobby his secret because he feels the timing is appropriate. Bobby is shocked at the secret because it means Morag was in fact her mother. Bobby is very angry when she finds out the truth and continues to pester Morag even after she is released from hospital. After a while, she gives in and reveals all to her. Bobby is more upset to find out Donald is her father because they have previously hated each other. Initially neither can handle the situation, but eventually the two decide to put their past differences aside and develop a close father-daughter relationship. When she discovers she is pregnant, she tells everyone but Donald; she tries to but is scared of what he will think. He is annoyed when he finds out and Bobby thinks he disapproves, but Donald tells her he is proud of her. At one point, Donald resigns from his job because of problems at the school so she enlists Pippa and Grant Mitchell's (Craig McLachlan) help to get his job back. After coming to terms with the prospect of being a mother, Bobby develops stomach pains and is devastated to find out she has suffered a miscarriage. When she gets her head together, she decides to take a leaf out of Pippa's book and looks into the prospect of fostering a child of her own. After a series of hits and misses, she wonders if it is the right thing to do. However, this all changes when she finds a young boy named Sam Nicholls (Ryan Clark). The two get on really well in the end and form a close relationship. Bobby and Sam's delight is soon put to an end when his biological father, Greg Marshall (Ross Newton), turns up in Summer Bay; after finding out their address from someone, he turns up and announces he is here to take Sam back home. Bobby is terrified at the thought of losing Sam, and she refuses to let Greg near him. Eventually, Bobby and Greg become close and start a relationship and they marry, much to the happiness of Sam. When a fair is held, Bobby's friend Adam Cameron (Mat Stevenson) wants to go for a boat ride with her and Luke Cunningham (John Adam).

After a few days, Bobby's friends and family each say their goodbyes to her, before the decision is made by Greg to turn off her life support machine. The whole town is affected by her death. Even her estranged mother Morag finds it hard to come to terms with. Adam is not charged with causing her death, but despite it being accidental, he is still treated like an outcast as he becomes hated by most of the Bay's residents and he is only forgiven after he saves Sam from a fire. He leaves soon after. When Ailsa is going through a rough time in 1995, she starts hallucinating due to the medication she is prescribed. One night, Ailsa hallucinates and Bobby's ghost suddenly appears before her on the fridge door, telling Ailsa that Alf cares about her. Reception Dickson won the Logie for \\"Most Popular New Talent\\" at the 1989 Logie Awards for her portrayal of Bobby.

Le Tour de la France par deux enfants (1877) is a French novel/geography/travel/school book. It was written by Augustine Fouill√©e (n√©e Tuillerie) who used the pseudonym of G. Bruno. She was the wife of Alfred Jules √âmile Fouill√©e. The book was widely used in the schools of the Third Republic, where it was influential for generations of children in creating a sense of a unified nation of France. Its success was such that it reached a circulation of 6 million copies in 1900, and by 1914 it had sold 7 million copies. It was still used in schools until the 1950s and is in print to this day. It is sometimes known as \\"the little red book of the Republic.\\" The story recounts the journey of two young brothers from Phalsbourg in Lorraine, Andrew and Julian Volden, who, following the annexation of the Alsace-Lorraine by the Prussians in the 1870-71 Franco- Prussian War, and the death of their father, go in search of family members through the French provinces. The diversity of the people they meet lead them on to learn more. There are passages on the taste of local foods, the strange patois, mitigated by methodical learning. It is very patriotic and emphasizes civic and moral education, as well as geography, science, history. The story teaches about monuments and symbols, exemplary lives of inventors, soldiers and patriot benefactors. The accumulated wealth of knowledge‚Äîagriculture, home economics, hygiene‚Äîleads them to establish a perfect farm called \\"La Grand'Lande\\", symbolic of the nation of France. The book was reissued in 2000 by Belin, and in 2006 by France Loisirs.

Formation The SS Cavalry Brigade was based on the SS Totenkopf Horse Regiment, which was raised in September 1939, for police and security duties in Poland, under the command of Hermann Fegelein. By April 1940, it consisted of 8 Saber Squadrons, 9th Replacement, 10th Heavy and 11th Technical Squadrons and a 12th Horse Battery of four 80mm guns. In May it was divided into two regiments, SS Totenkopf Horse Regiments 1 & 2, each of four squadrons, 5th Heavy and 6th Horse Battery also included were Signals, Engineer and Motorcycle platoons. In March 1941 they were renamed SS Cavalry Regiments 1 and 2 and reformed again into 1st, 2nd and 3rd Saber Squadrons, 4th (Machine Gun), 5th (Mortar and Infantry Gun), 6th (Technical), 7th (Bicycle) and 8th (Horse Battery) Squadrons. In early August 1941, Himmler ordered the SS Cavalry Brigade to be formed under the command of Hermann Fegelein from the 1st and 2nd SS cavalry regiments. Personnel were taken from the saber squadrons to form the brigade's Artillery, Engineer and Bicycle (Reconnaissance) Squadrons. They were also given a light anti-aircraft battery. The brigade now had a strength of 3,500 men 2,900 horses and 375 vehicles. Soviet Union After the German invasion of the Soviet Union (Operation Barbarossa), the SS cavalry regiments, along with the 1 SS Infantry Brigade were assigned to \\"pacify\\" what was seen as the main trouble spots in the occupied territories. On 19 July 1941, the SS cavalry regiments were transferred to the general command of HSSPF Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski for action in the area of the Pripet marsh, a large area of land that covered parts of Belorussia and the Northern Ukraine. Thereafter, the regiments combined to become the SS Cavalry Brigade. They were ordered to perform the \\"systematic combing of the Pripyat swamps\\". The SS Cavalry Brigade was assigned because it was more mobile and better able to carry out large- scale operations; the brigade played a pivotal role in the transition from \\"selective mass murder\\" to the wholesale extermination of the Jewish population of the occupied part of the Soviet Union. By 1 August, the SS Cavalry Regiment was responsible for the death of 800 people; five days later, on 6 August, this total had reached 3,000 \\"Jews and Partisans\\". Also on 1 August, after a meeting between Heinrich Himmler, Erich von Bach-Zelewski and Hinrich Lohse, the brigade received the following: \\"Explicit order by RFSS All Jews must be shot. Drive the female Jews into the swamps.\\" Gustav Lombard, on receiving the order, advised his battalion that: \\"In future not one male Jew is to remain alive not one family in the villages\\". Throughout the next weeks, members of the SS Cavalry Regiment 1, under Lombard's command, murdered an estimated 11,000 Jews and more than 400 dispersed soldiers of the Red Army. Sturmbannf√ºhrer Franz Magill and his men of the SS Cavalry Regiment 2, assisted in the roundup of all the men aged 18 to 55 in the city of Pinsk, where 5,000 to 8,000 men were shot and shortly afterwards, another 2,000 residents including women, children and older men were murdered. Fegelein's final report on the operation, dated 18 September 1941, states that they killed 14,178 Jews, 1,001 partisans, and 699 Red Army soldiers with losses of 17 dead, 36 wounded, and 3 missing. The historian Henning Pieper estimates the actual number of Jews killed was closer to 23,700. General of Infantry Max von Schenckendorff, commander of Army Group Center described their operations the following way: > The SS Cavalry Brigade operates as follows: at dawn, without prior > reconnaissance, the troop tasked with the inspection of a village rides into > it at full speed and out the other end, occupies the outer edges of the > village in a trice, in accordance with an agreed plan, and then gathers the > whole population together, including women and children, for inspection. In > many cases the skill and experience of the commanding officer, and also of > the accompanying SD and GFP groups together with their interpreters, will > decide upon the composition of the male inhabitants and their occupation, as > well as upon their fate, so that the area is cleared of opposition and > pacified.Case studies on Anti-Partisan Warfare during the Eastern Campaign\\" > by Ruth Bettina Birn in \\"From Peace to War: Germany, Soviet Russia and the > World, 1939-1941\\" edited by Bernd Wegner, p. 278. After the Soviet counterattack in January 1942, the only large formation not already committed was the SS Cavalry Brigade. Launching an attack on 7 January, it was also forced back after only one day's fighting when it had run out of ammunition. One of its Battalions also reported 75% casualties when fighting in the woods north of Rzhev. The Brigade was found to be wanting and not equipped or trained to take on the Soviet Armoured units. In March 1942, the SS Cavalry Brigade was used as the cadre in the formation of the 8th SS Cavalry Division Florian Geyer. Post-war German authorities investigated the activities of the SS cavalry formations in the 1960s.

The Supreme Administrative Court of Sweden (, before 2011 Regeringsr√§tten, acronym RR or RegR) is the supreme court and the third and final tier for administrative court cases in Sweden, and is located in Stockholm. It has a parallel status to that of the Supreme Court of Sweden (), which is the supreme court for criminal and civil law cases. It hears cases which have been decided by one of the four Administrative courts of appeal, which represent the second tier for administrative court cases in Sweden. Before a case can be decided, a leave to appeal must be obtained, which is typically only granted when the case is of interest as a precedent. The bulk of its caseload consist of taxation and social security cases. Justices of the Supreme Administrative Court () are appointed by government, but the court as an institution is independent of the Riksdag, and the government is not able to interfere with the decisions of the court. By law, there shall be fourteen Justices of the Supreme Administrative Court or such a higher a number as may be required, at the government's discretion. As of 2009, there were eighteen Justices in the court. One of the Justices serves as president and head of the court, and is appointed by the government to this function. Since 2018, justice Helena J√§derblom serves as the court's president. In total the court has approximately 100 employees.  History  The court was founded in 1909. Before that, the Supreme Court of Sweden handed administrative court matters as well. From 1972 until 2009, the Supreme Administrative Court resided in the Stenbock Palace on the Riddarholmen islet in central Stockholm. Since 2011 the court sits in Kammarr√§ttens hus (the former Administrative Court of Appeal Building) and the Sparre Palace on Riddarholmen. Presidents of the Supreme Administrative Court of Sweden Originally, there were no regulations on the presidency of the Supreme Administrative Court. According to practice, the senior member of the post served as chair when the court met in plenary session, and the second oldest served as department chair. In its report of 1966, the Administrative Court Committee (F√∂rvaltningsdomstolskommitt√©n) proposed a new order, in which the President of the Supreme Administrative Court (as well as the chair of a section of the Supreme Administrative Court) was appointed by the King in Council. This became a reality in the Administrative Process Reform (F√∂rvaltningsprocessreformen) in 1972.

David Rose was a local businessman. This Gothic Revival house is unusual in that it is eight-sided, an octagon. Each of the eight gables include decorated wood panels. Covered porches have been added to three sides. The octagon house rose in popularity in 1849 with the publication of Orson Squire Fowler's book A Home For All. The idea was to develop affordable and comfortable housing for the working class. Fowler proposed the use of concrete due to its long life and low cost. Most octagon houses are of wood or brick construction. The \\"octagon craze\\" was short-lived and pre-dates the American Civil War. Fewer than 120 octagon houses survive. David Rose David Rose was a successful business man in Valparaiso. At the start of the American Civil War, he was appointed as Colonel Rose, Commandant of the 54th Indiana Volunteer Infantry at Camp Morton, Indiana. Design The Rose Octagonal House is a two-story octagon house of frame construction. The exterior is covered with clapboard siding. Each of the eight sides has a gable roof. A brick chimney runs up the center of the house. The Gothic Revival design is evident in the leaf like pendants cut into its bargeboard trim. Also of Gothic design is a four pointed design at the peak of each gable. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs. Each one of the eight sides is exactly 12' 2\\" or long. A one-story porch, added at a later date, runs the length of the front face. An addition had been added to the back of the house. The addition was two stories with an attached garage.Visual inspection when photographed, see image file, 2007 The interior has all the original casings for the doors and windows. The floor has been replaced with narrow tongue and groove oak. Significance The David Garland Rose House is architecturally important because of its rare octagonal design, combined with its one-of-a-kind treatment of the roof. Constructed about 1860, the house's octagonal design resulted from a short-lived style popularized by Orson Squire Fowler's, A Home for All or the Gravel Wall and Octagonal Mode of Building, published in 1848. Octagon-shaped houses are rare in Indiana. Less than a dozen are known to be extant. Unlike other octagonal houses in Indiana, each side of the Rose House is gabled, and the eight gabled roofs meet at the center.

It is played by many people throughout the country, especially in the Terai region. The biggest cricketing achievement of the national cricket team was when the team reached the qualification tournament of 2014 ICC World T20 held in Bangladesh. Nepal's playing season runs from September to November and starts again in March before finishing in May. The National Cricket Academy, NCA, was formally opened in January 2013 by the Cricket Association of Nepal to guide emerging players and to provide continuous training facilities to the men's national team, under-19 team and the women's national team. As of December 2012, there were 429 senior cricket clubs and 227 junior cricket clubs in Nepal. History Beginnings In 1920s Cricket was introduced to Nepal for the first time by Lt.-Gen.Madan Shumsher JBR youngest son of Rana Prime Minister Maharaja Chandra Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana. But at the time, cricket was considered a \\"gentleman's game\\" so was limited to the ruling Rana family members and some elites of Nepal. Though the game was kept within themselves and other members of the elite, the Cricket Association of Nepal was formed in 1946 to promote cricket amongst the aristocracy. After the introduction of democracy through the Revolution of 1951, cricket began to spread to the rest of the population. In 1961, in an effort to promote cricket to the whole of Nepal, the Cricket Association of Nepal became part of the National Sports Council. Nevertheless, the National games tended to be limited to Kathmandu until the 1980s. ICC and ACC Membership Improvements to the communication and transport infrastructure in Nepal allowed the game to expand outside Kathmandu in the 1980s, and Nepal became an Affiliate Member of the ICC in 1988. A major development programme began in the early 1990s, with regional and district tournaments established and cricket being promoted in the schools. Nepal became an Associate Member of the ACC in 1990 and became a full member in 1994. Interest in cricket increased quickly in the 1990s, and demand to play was such that the number of teams in tournaments had to be restricted until more facilities could be built. Nepal became an Associate Member of the ICC in 1996, which was the year the national side played for the first time, in the ACC Trophy in Kuala Lumpur. Nepal finished fourth out of six teams in their first round group in this competition, beating Brunei and Japan.1996 ACC Trophy at CricketEurope Governing Body The Cricket Association of Nepal is the official governing body of the sport of cricket in Nepal. It was formed in 1946. Cricket Grounds There are 65 grounds in Nepal with 17 turf wickets. International matches can be played only at the Tribhuvan University International Cricket Ground. A new international standard ground is under construction in Mulpani, Kathmandu, and another is slated to be built in Pokhara with some assistance from the Asian Cricket Council. The following are the main cricket stadiums in Nepal: * Tribhuvan University International Cricket Ground, Kirtipur, Kathmandu ‚Äì the ground has hosted first-class matches, international matches and domestic T20 and One Day matches with a 20,000 spectator-capacity. * Pulchok Engineering Cricket Ground, Pulchok, Lalitpur ‚Äì hosted the ACC Trophy * Biratnagar Cricket Ground, Baijanathpur, Biratnagar (Under construction) * Sainik Awasiya Maha Vidyalaya Ground, Sallaghari, Bhaktapur * Rangashala Cricket Ground, Pokhara, Kaski * Fapla Cricket Ground, Dhangadi, Kailali * District Sports Development Committee Ground, Mahendranagar, Kanchanpur * Mulpani Cricket Stadium, Mulpani, Kathmandu - hosted domestic one day tournament (PM Cup) *Siddhartha Rangashala, Bhairahawa Men's National Team The Nepal National Cricket Team represents Nepal in international cricket matches. They have been participating in international matches since 2013, including every ACC Trophy tournament, the 2001 ICC Trophy and two ICC Intercontinental Cups. After finishing 2018 ICC World Cricket League Division Two at second place Nepal National Cricket Team claims the place in 2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier. On 15 March 2018 Nepal claimed One Day International (ODI) status for the first time with their win over Papua New Guinea in the 2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier play off encounter. With getting One Day International (ODI) status Nepal also regained Twenty20 International (T20I) status. Nepal ended their first ODI series in a 1-1 draw against the Netherlands, winning a close encounter in the second match by 1 run on 3 August 2018. Nepal also has an under-19 cricket team. Women's National Team The Nepal National Women's Cricket Team represents Nepal in international women's cricket matches. They made their international debut in the ACC Women's Tournament in Malaysia in July 2007. Domestic Cricket Domestic cricket is divided into 9 regions (Kathmandu, Janakpur, Birgunj, Baitadi, Biratnagar, Bhairahawa, Nepalgunj, Pokhara and Mahendranagar along with the APF and the Nepal Army).

Becker's work and collaborations have received lots of recognition, ranging from Tony Awards and nominations for his show, to inclusion in the collections of some of the world's most prestigious libraries, and even the dedication of a park bench in New York City's Gramercy Park. Becker is also well known for his promotion work and his ability to launch new talent, so much so that he has often been referred to as a \\"star maker.\\" Throughout his career, Becker has encouraged musical development in young people, as shown in his 1976 establishment of the Richard S. Becker Scholarship at the Juilliard School of Music. Career Becker's earliest major work was with Pat Boone on the #1 hit \\"Moody River\\". His work with The Beatles on \\"Anna (Go To Him)\\" and The Rolling Stones (\\"You Better Move On\\") not only brought forward the Muscle Shoals Sound for the first time, but also produced the first crossover hit from R&B; to pop. Among his other collaborations, Becker worked with a team to adapt gospel music to Broadway. This team initially included Alex Bradford, on a production commissioned by the Italian government for Gian-Carlo Menotti's Two Worlds Festival held in Spoleto, Italy, entitled \\"Black Nativity\\". The show, based on the play by Langston Hughes, proved such a success that two years later, the group was asked to do another production. The result was Your Arms Too Short to Box with God. The Tony Award-winning production of Your Arms Too Short to Box with God became the first show fully funded in its production by the Ford's Theater in Washington, D.C.. President Jimmy Carter chose Your Arms as the first show presented by his administration Your Arms went on to enjoy a lengthy run at Broadway's Lyceum Theater, and is one of the only shows to experience two revivals in four years. Your Arms gave rise to Tony Award- nominated Performances (Al Green), reinvigorated the career of Patti LaBelle, and showcased the professional debut of Jennifer Holiday. Your Arms has influenced more than music - for example, the prominent televangelist James Dobson makes frequent reference to the musical and devoted an entire section to its influence in one of his best selling books. Becker has worked with many genres over the course of his career. For example, he was responsible for bringing the first country music show to New York City's Madison Square Garden in 1964. Many of Becker's works have been included in many collections. Some examples are his inclusion for his popular records (including Pat Boone and The Beatles) in Collier's and the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. In addition, Becker's work with Alex Bradford has been included in James Weldon Johnson's private collection at the Beinecke Library at Yale University, his own submission of the Richard S. Becker music collection at the Beinecke, the Richard S. Becker collection of Alex Bradford Gospel Music Materials Archives at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History and many of his songs (such as \\"Anna\\", \\"Moody River\\" and \\"You Better Move On\\") are featured within the collections of The British Library. Becker has worked with a wide range of people. In the 1980s, he collaborated with astrologer Jeane Dixon and one of her songs was recorded by The Chuck Wagon Gang.

The school opened in September 2004 and was the fifth school opened in the United States by the British Schools of America. In 2013, BISC joined Nord Anglia Education, an international education provider with 66 international schools and over 50,000 students. Curriculum  International Primary Curriculum (IPC)  The British International School of Charlotte offers Primary School from Nursery to Grade 5 (18 months - Year 6) under the International Primary Curriculum (IPC). The International Primary Curriculum is a thematic curriculum.  International Middle Years Curriculum (IMYC)  BISC offers the International Middle-Years Curriculum (IMYC) which addresses the needs of Middle Years students in Grades 6 - 10 (Year 7 - Year 11). The IMYC is a curriculum for students covering science, literacy, geography, history, art, PE, technology and Information and communications technology (ICT). It is organized into thematic units of work, each lasting for six weeks. Each unit is structured into discrete subjects.  International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE)  The International General Certificate of Secondary Education IGCSE is an English language curriculum offered to BISC students to prepare them for the International Baccalaureate and A Level. The IGCSE was developed by University of Cambridge International Examinations. Students begin IGCSE studies at the beginning of Grade 10 Year 11 and take the test at the end of Grade 12 Year 13. The IGCSE is an international alternative to many popular national curricula. However, unlike many school-leaving qualifications in some countries, the IGCSE is not a group award or \\"certificate of education\\". It is a qualification based on individual subjects of study, which means that one receives an \\"IGCSE\\" qualification for each subject one takes. The IGCSE is predominantly exam-based, similar to Advanced Placement (AP) exams and SAT Subject Tests. The IGCSE prepares students for further academic study, progression to A Level, Cambridge Pre-U or the IB Diploma Programme by providing a study program covering subjects from a variety of areas, including Languages, Humanities, Social Sciences, Mathematics, Creative, Technical and Vocational.

This idea fell down through the ages and developed into a series of European patents around 1924, when the thought of electrically heating the wire cloth for screens was considered. This was the first attempt at eliminating screen blinding (when the material being processed (clay, dirt, etc.) clogs the holes in the screen) by using heat, and it proved that the surface tension from blinding was reduced when heat was introduced. The first commercially available screen heating system was developed in 1947 by F.R. Hannon & Sons (now Hanco International (), and Thomas W. Hannon obtained a patent for his electrically heated screen construction and method . This was just in time, as industries were beginning to expand in coming out of World War II. The first applications of the screen heating system were limited almost exclusively to the clay industry, though it did not take long for other applications, in a variety of industries, to be identified. Another significant invention for screen heating was created by Thomas W. Hannon (for Hanco International). This was for screen-related clamp bars (also known as a Wedge Grip), that are used when mounting a screen on frame members. The clamp bars secured a screen to a tensioning rail, which in turn increased the electrical connection between the two components. () In the years following, copper and copper cables were implemented in an attempt to improve the system. Silicon-bonded fiberglass was also added to the insulation of screen boxes. For a short period, flexible shunts were also used, but a major deficiency was found in attaching the stationary transformer to a screen that vibrated.  The Invention of the Flux-Power Screen Heating System  In exploring ways to properly attach a transformer to a vibrating screen, Hanco International () pioneered the Flux- Power Screen Heating System . The invention came to be in 1961, created by Thomas W. Hannon (), and it was unlike anything of its time. The design eliminated the use of physical connections as seen in earlier screen heating systems. Omitting the mechanical connection also deletes the possibility of primary winding failures that come with short circuits on the secondary of the transformer while eliminating wear and fatigue on the screen, itself. This design also allowed for the transformer to be encapsulated and protected from the elements and dust. When processing basic mineral deposits (clay, shale, limestone, etc.), Flux-Powered Screen Heating Systems are ideal. Heating the screen lessens surface tension from moisture which is a main reason for stickiness against cloth mediums. Introducing heat allows maximum contact and keeps the screen clear, allowing finer material separations and more precise sizing. This, in turn, adds to efficiency. Flux-Powered Screen Heating Systems have been used and proven effective in screening fertilizers (in handling phosphoric, potash and sulfate rock), foods, chemicals, and in recovering coal for power.

History Fence was founded in 1997 by Kenny Anderson, who performs under the name King Creosote, who, after the record shop he was working in went bust, began to record and sell the music of his friends. The label side of Fence grew steadily in size, in terms of audience and artist roster, boasting a variety of musical styles beyond its initial folk slant and geographical focus. Fence organised a number of festivals including Homegame, Haarfest, Hott Loggz and Eye o' the Dug which took place in Anstruther, Cellardyke and St. Andrews, and Away Game which took place on the Isle of Eigg. Various festivals have also hosted Fence Nights/showcases including Edinburgh Festival Fringe and Glasgow's West End Festival. The label became a limited company during 2012, but Kenny Anderson increasingly distanced himself from the label early in the partnership, feeling that the label and collective had strayed into territory where he was less comfortable. The limited company ceased operations in August 2013, due to differences between Kenny Anderson and The Pictish Trail who had been handling most of the organisation of releases and events since 2003. The announcement that the limited company would cease operations was followed by a statement from Anderson, saying that he will continue to use the Fence Records name with new projects to be announced in January 2014.

This area was part of the most fashionable residential district of the city in the second half of the 19th century, and was home to many of the city's elite. Its architectural styles are diverse, with a significant number of homes designed by local architect George M. Coombs. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. Description and history The Main Street‚ÄìFrye Street Historic District encompasses 37 houses, primarily located on two blocks of Main and Frye Streets, between the city's downtown area and the early portions of the Bates College campus. The district extends on the east side of Main Street, between Mountain Avenue and Whipple Street, and includes three houses on the west side, north of Central Street. It includes all properties on Frye Street, running east from Main to College Streets, and three adjacent houses on the west side of College Street north of Frye. Many of these properties are now part of the Bates campus. Lewiston was developed as a major textile center beginning in the 1830s by John and William Frye. The Franklin Company, which operated the mills, owned much of the land in the area, and laid out its streets. Bates College was founded in 1864, named for later mill owner Benjamin E. Bates. The area in between the city's downtown and the Bates campus was originally farmland, which began to be sold off for development in 1851. One of the first houses built on Frye Street was that of Oren B. Cheney, the founder of Bates College, in 1866. The Frye Street area became popular with many of the city's business and political elites because it lay just beyond company-owned lands, and was close to the college. As a result, a significant number of architecturally high-quality houses were built, from Greek Revival and Gothic Revival cottages to elaborate Second Empire style mansions. There are 12 Queen Anne Victorians, and 11 Colonial Revival houses. Twelve of the district's 37 houses were designed by local architect George M. Coombs, providing a distinctive view of his residential designs. The area contains the Sen. William P. Frye House and the James C. Lord House, both previously listed on the National Register. Bates College now owns most of the houses on Frye Street.

Caldwell & Co., of New York City, was one of the premier designers and manufacturers of electric light fixtures and decorative metalwork from the late 19th to the mid-20th centuries. Founded in 1895 by Edward F. Caldwell (1851‚Äì1914) and Victor F. von Lossberg (1853‚Äì1942), the firm left a legacy of custom designed and finely-made, metal gates, lanterns, chandeliers, ceiling and wall fixtures, floor and table lamps, and other decorative objects that can be found today in many metropolitan area churches, public buildings, offices, clubs, and residences including, the White House (1902 renovation), St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York, New York Public Library, and Rockefeller Center. Edward F. Caldwell (1851-1914) Edward F. Caldwell, a portrait painter originally from Waterville, New York, became part of an active community of designers in New York City during the early 1880s. By the end of that decade and into the 1890s, Caldwell worked for, and later became chief designer and vice president of, the Archer & Pancoast Manufacturing Company of New York, top designers of gas lighting fixtures. At this time, due to Thomas Edison's advances in developing the electric light bulb, Archer & Pancoast began manufacturing fixtures using this new technology. Caldwell faced the challenge of mastering an understanding of electric light and adapting electric fixtures to traditional ornamental esthetics that were acceptable to the late 19th century American public. While at Archer & Pancoast, Caldwell oversaw three major commissions for McKim, Mead, and White, as well as commissions for the New York State Building at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition (Chicago), The [Metropolitan Club] of New York City, and the Boston Public Library. Through these projects, Caldwell became a friend of Stanford White (1853‚Äì1906), a young architect who saw the importance of electric illumination for designing future interiors and buildings. He understood that technological advances of slender tubing, small electric bulbs, concealed wiring, modern switch units, and low voltage current linked to small sockets would allow fixtures to take new and diverse forms, sharing decorative as well as utilitarian functions. White encouraged Caldwell to focus solely on designing electric light fixtures. chandelier In 1895, Caldwell established the firm Edward F. Caldwell & Co., Inc. of New York with Victor von Lossberg at 31 East 17th Street. Von Lossberg, a designer and draftsman Caldwell had worked with at Archer & Pancoast, was a native of Latvia who was raised in Russia and studied design in Germany. Caldwell and von Lossberg brought skilled artisans from Europe to New York to work for the firm. They frequently traveled to Europe studying and importing historic objects for use as inspiration in the production of their electric light fixtures. In 1901, they established their own foundry at 36-40 West 15th Street, along with their showrooms and offices. They quickly became known for producing lighting fixtures and metalwork objects in bronze, iron, silver, brass, and copper. The firm attracted commissions from some of the most prominent architects of the period including McKim, Mead & White, Carrere & Hastings, Cram, Goodhue & Ferguson, and Cass Gilbert. Caldwell & Co. produced a wide variety of objects based on historic styles since many of their wealthy and established clientele preferred traditional designs. They showed clients photographs and actual historic examples of French, Italian and English forms that could be adapted as electric light fixtures and that would fit esthetically into traditional or period interiors. The firm also worked closely with the architects, interior decorators and other subcontractors to coordinate the aesthetic unity of a project, using their extensive photo archive to inspire new designs. A watercolor or colored pencil presentation drawing was then created for review by designer and client before the piece was put into production. After production, pieces were often photographed to be added to the company's extensive photo archive. The success of the Caldwell firm was due to extensive variety of historic patterns at hand, which could be effectively incorporated into electric fixtures to enhance the beauty of an interior. Under Von Lossberg, the company created more original designs rather than strictly duplicating antiques that had been a standard for the firm previously. Lighting and desk accessories now contained intricate gilding and vitreous enamel work. In the 1920s, the firm also explored more contemporary designs such as Art Deco styles for lights at Radio City Music Hall and the Waldorf- Astoria Hotel. With a staff that numbered more than 1,000 in the early decades of the 20th century, they also had the ability to take on large commissions. As a result, they landed many of the biggest jobs of the day, including new churches, train stations, state capitols, residences and other public buildings throughout the country. The firm continued under Victor von Lossberg after Edward Caldwell died in October 1914. Edward T. Caldwell, grandson of the founder, took over the firm when von Lossberg retired in 1938. Caldwell & Co. then produced more standardized fixtures and fluorescent lamps until 1956, when it was liquidated by the Internal Revenue Service. The company reorganized as E.T. Caldwell Lighting, but closed permanently due to financial problems in 1959. Much of their work can still be seen today throughout the country and even abroad. The Cooper-Hewitt Museum Library includes an E. F. Caldwell & Co. Collection with more than 50,000 images, of which roughly 37,000 are black-and-white photographs and approximately 13,000 are original design drawings of lighting fixtures and other metal objects produced by the company from the late 19th to the mid-20th century.

They were so called, because the first three aircraft of the series (R614K, R613K, B11D) were built entirely in secrecy. In total, five Type Rs were built and flown by some of the most notable flyers of the day, including Jimmy Doolittle, Doug Davis, Frank Hawks, and Pancho Barnes, not only in races but also at air shows across the United States, and most notably, by Hawks in Europe. Replica G-TATR at Old Warden, June 2014 Design and development The environment in air racing at the time was one of give and take with the military. A civilian designer would take an existing aircraft design, modify it for greater speed and enter it in the race. Since the military already had access to the fastest and most advanced aircraft available, it was simply a matter of upping the horsepower on whatever aircraft they were using and the problem was solved. This led to the military completely dominating the air racing scene. In an effort to combat this, two Travel Air designers; Herb Rawdon and Walter Burnham undertook proving that a civilian aircraft built from scratch and designed exclusively for racing (as opposed to combat or passenger/mail service) could out-fly the military.Larson, George C. \\"Moments and Milestones: Travel Air‚Äôs Mystery Ship.\\" Air & Space Magazine, September 1, 2010. Retrieved: December 20, 2010. Under construction during 1928, the aircraft was kept under cover prior to the 1929 Cleveland Air Races, with the builders even going so far painting the windows on the factory to keep the curious press from getting a look at it. The local Wichita paper picked up on the secret program, with one reporter even going so far as to scale a ladder to try to peek into the vents in the factory roof. The paper dubbed it the \\"Mystery Ship\\" and the name stuck with R (for Rawdon) added. Rawdon and Burnham both knew that to approach Travel Air CEO Walter Beech would be fruitless, unless they hit him with the idea just before the air racing season began, so they designed the aircraft in their spare time, without pay until they could get Beech to agree to build the type. During an era when biplanes were still common, the use of a monoplane planform, a NACA engine cowl, and large wheel pants significantly reduced aerodynamic drag, creating a streamlined design. Construction of the fuselage and wings was based on a plywood structure with the thin wings braced with wires. The sleek, polished fuselage continued the shape and width of the cowl throughout, with the cockpit featuring a small windshield, set nearly flush with the skin. A turtle deck extended from the cockpit to the vertical tail creating a fairing for the helmeted head of the pilot.Replica G-TATR at Old Warden, June 2014 Travel Air R Mystery Ship with Chevrolair engine. Photo from Aero Digest November 1929 The first \\"Mystery Ship\\", NR614K (Race No. 31), was designed for both closed- course and long-distance racing. NR614K had two sets of wings, a shorter set of racing wings, about one and shorter in span and narrower in chord than the set used for cross-country events. R614K was destroyed when it caught fire before the 1931 Thompson Trophy race. The plane has since undergone a complete restoration and now resides at the Beechcraft Heritage Museum in Tullahoma, Tennessee.https://www.beechcraftheritagemuseum.org/exhibits.html Pancho Barnes's Travel Air Mystery Ship NR-613K appearing in Sky Bride (1932) The second Type R, NR-613K (Race No. 32) powered by a six-cylinder D-6 Chevrolair, manufactured by Arthur Chevrolet Aviation Motors Corporation of Indianapolis, Indiana. The six-cylinder air-cooled, inverted inline engine developed 165 hp at 2,175 rpm, and powered NR-613K to a win in the Experimental class at the 1929 National Air Races. NR-613K was later converted back to a radial-engined version by Florence \\"Pancho\\" Barnes. Paul Mantz later purchased the aircraft and used it extensively in film work. Years later, Barnes bought it back in an auction where other pilots made sure nobody bid against her. It is currently undergoing restoration in the UK. The third Mystery Ship, NR-482N (Race No. 35), was purchased by Shell for the use of Jimmy Hazlip and Jimmy Doolittle.

The fourth Type R, NR-1313, purchased by the Texaco Company for Frank Hawks as \\"Texaco 13\\" became the most famous of the series, setting numerous long distance records both in the United States and internationally. \\"Texaco 13\\" is now displayed at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago. A fifth Type R, 11717/MM185, was built at the request of the Italian government several years after the rest, after Hawks toured the European continent. After factory construction and testing, it was subsequently disassembled, shipped by boat to Italy and served as the basis for the Breda Ba.27 fighter. It was later scrapped. The last Type R was built by Travel Air after it had been absorbed by Curtiss-Wright. Racing The Model R series set numerous speed records for both pylon racing and cross- country flying, and were the most advanced aircraft of the day, by far outpacing anything that even the military could offer.Vorderman 1969, p. 138. On September 2, 1929, Doug Davis entered the \\"Mystery Ship\\" in the Thompson Cup Race. Davis won at a speed of 194.9 mph (one lap flown at 208.69 mph), beating the military entries, even recircling one of the pylons twice. Davis missed the second pylon of the course, circled back and while circling it again blacked out momentarily. Not knowing if he had missed the pylon again, Davis went around one more time, then continued on to win the race.Mystery Ship: A History of the Travel Air Type R Monoplanes (Historic Aircraft Series), September 1, 1999, by Edward H.

The episodes aired on the U.S. Sci Fi Channel and SPACE in Canada respectively on March 13 and March 20, 2009. The second part (\\"Daybreak, Parts 2 & 3\\") is double-length. The episodes were written by Ronald D. Moore, and directed by Michael Rymer. The Season 4.5 DVD and Blu-ray releases for Region 1 feature an extended version of the finale, which not only combines all three parts as a single episode, but also integrates it with new scenes not seen in the aired versions of either part. The survivor count shown in the title sequence for Part 1 is 39,516. The survivor count shown in the title sequence for Part 2 is 39,406. At the end of Part 2, Admiral Adama announces the survivor population at approximately 38,000. The episodes portray the Galactica launching a rescue mission to retrieve Hera Agathon from the \\"colony\\", a heavily armed and defended Cylon base located near a black hole. They manage to rescue Hera, and in the end, the fleet finds a new planet to settle on, which they come to call Earth (revealed to be our Earth). The final episodes gave Battlestar Galactica the strongest ratings since its second season, though they received mixed reviews. Plot Part 1 The Galactica crew members and civilians divide themselves between those joining the rescue attempt, and those staying behind with the fleet. The flashback sequences during the course of the first part take place a few years before the Cylon attack on Caprica. William Adama (Edward James Olmos) is reluctant to undergo a lie detector test in preparation for a civilian desk job. Elsewhere, Gaius Baltar (James Callis) is getting tired of his father, Julius, who is abusive to his nurse. However, Caprica Six (Tricia Helfer) soon informs Baltar that she took his father into a care home, where he will be happier. Laura Roslin (Mary McDonnell) is living happily with her two sisters, one of whom is pregnant. But later, Roslin receives distressing news that both her sisters and father were killed in a car accident. Three months after, she is set up for a blind date and is encouraged to join Mayor Adar's presidential campaign. Lee Adama (Jamie Bamber) meets Kara Thrace (Katee Sackhoff) for the first time while she is seeing his brother, Zak (Tobias Mehler). When Lee arrives home drunk, he notices a pigeon in his house, and he chases it away. Lastly, the flashbacks focus on Anders (Michael Trucco), who is interviewed during his sporting career, where he admits to playing for the joy of the pursuit of perfection rather than the winning. Back in the present, Galactica is being stripped for parts to be used on other ships, while the military will be transferred to control the Rebel Basestar. The pictures of the fallen in the memorial hallway are also taken down. Baltar wants his people to have a seat on the quorum, but Lee refuses. Admiral Adama later decides to give amnesty to those who took part in the attempted coup d'√©tat, as well as to Tyrol (Aaron Douglas), who is in the brig for helping Boomer (Grace Park) escape. This allows Tyrol to take part in the mission to retrieve Hera (Iliana Gomez-Martinez), who is being studied by the Cylons to determine how Cylons can reproduce. Adama announces a plan to rescue the child Hera at the colony and that it will be a one-way trip for the Galactica, and requires all Galactica personnel to either volunteer for the mission or decline in person. He and Starbuck lay a line down the center of the landing bay and personnel move to one side to volunteer or the other to remain with the Fleet. Doc Cottle (Donnelly Rhodes) attempts to join in, but is ordered back by Adama as the fleet cannot afford to lose a doctor. Several others join in the operation, including the original Cylon models, and a weakened Roslin. A Raptor is dispatched to the possible location of the \\"Colony\\", only to find it located very close to a black hole, but despite the circumstance, Adama orders an attack to begin and planning commences. Part 2 In flashback sequences, William Adama and Saul Tigh (Michael Hogan) celebrate their upcoming retirement, where Tigh convinces Adama to take his new job. Later, as Adama is questioned in an interview, he complains that no job is worth questioning his loyalty and decides to rejoin the military. Lee has dinner with Zak and Starbuck again. When Zak passes out, drunk, the sexual tension between Kara and Lee nearly erupts before they are interrupted by a stirring Zak. Back home, Lee again encounters the pigeon, but this time he does not chase it. Roslin meets her blind date, who happens to be a former student of hers. After spending the night together, she has second thoughts and ends the date; she then calls Adar's campaign, informing them of her intention to join it. Boomer meets Adama and Tigh for the first time, where she is warned that she is on the verge of ending her career due to her inability to land a Raptor. Given one last chance, Boomer gratefully tells the two that unlike other pilots, she will repay Adama one day. Meanwhile, Baltar, believing that Caprica Six is a corporate spy, allows her access to the military defense mainframe. He says that he is not doing this for her employers, but for her. Back in the present of the series, Baltar decides to join the mission with Caprica Six at the last minute; she later admits to being proud of him for the first time. At that moment it is revealed that Baltar's Inner Six and Six's Inner Baltar are aware of each other, and the two real-life counterparts see both of them. Romo Lampkin (Mark Sheppard) is installed as president, and Hoshi (Brad Dryborough) is given command of the fleet while Adama and Galactica set off to rescue Hera. A battalion of the self-aware Cylon Centurions who are aligned with the fleet march down the flight deck - red stripes painted diagonally on their chests to distinguish them from the others. Galactica jumps right next to the colony, where they are immediately fired upon. Some of the Raptors, which are armed with nuclear weapons, make a short jump into the debris field and fly toward the back of the colony; in the process, Racetrack (Leah Cairns) and Skulls (Collin Lawrence) are killed by an asteroid. Anders has been installed into the CIC computers, and disables the Colony hybrids (Tiffany Lyndall-Knight). Starbuck's Raptor, carrying Athena and Helo, lands on the Colony - the only Raptor to make it through - and they enter to search for Hera. Galactica rams straight into the colony, where a strike team led by Apollo rappels in from Galactica to search for Hera, eventually meeting with Starbuck's squad. Hera is rescued by Boomer, who kills Simon (Rick Worthy) and finds Starbuck's team. Boomer hands Hera over to Athena (Grace Park) and tells her to \\"tell the old man I owed him one.\\" After her daughter is returned, Athena kills Boomer. Galactica is set upon by Cylon boarding parties arriving in \\"platoon strength\\", as reported to Tigh and Adama in the CIC. As Starbuck, Apollo, Athena and Helo return to the battlestar and make their way to CIC, they encounter a boarding party composed of Cavil's modern Centurions and original Cylon War models. Hera runs away in the confusion. She is spotted by Roslin, who had a vision of her while assisting with triage, and is able to hide her from the Cylons, until she disappears again. While Roslin gives chase, Baltar and Caprica Six also spot Hera and give chase as well. The chase parallels the Opera House vision shared between Athena, Roslin and Caprica Six. The chase ends in the CIC, where Cavil (Dean Stockwell) takes her hostage and demands to leave with Hera so she can be dissected and establish a method for Cylons to reproduce. Inner Six and Inner Baltar again appear jointly to Baltar, inspiring him to make the speech his entire life has led to, saying, among other things, that he sees angels, and that a divine force (\\"whether God or Gods\\") has entwined the destinies of both sides. Tigh provides the final incentive, saying that the Final Five will give the Cylons back resurrection (a solution to the problem of Cylon extinction) if they vow to forever go separate ways from humanity and end their pursuit. Combined, this convinces Cavil and Adama to end the war, Cavil gives Hera back and will let them leave in peace when the Final Five give the technology for resurrection. Part 3 Cavil calls a cease fire in preparation for the data download and the boarding parties retreat. Roslin and Adama look on as the Final Five begin the download of the technology for resurrection, with Saul and Ellen Tigh (Kate Vernon), Tory Foster (Rekha Sharma) and Galen Tyrol (Aaron Douglas) dipping their hands into Samuel Anders' (Michael Trucco) tank to transfer the data to the Colony. Ellen warns that during the download they will briefly have full knowledge of each other's memories and experiences. Tory asks that all bygones be left bygones. The download commences and the Final Five experience flashbacks to each other's lives on Earth and in the colonies. Tyrol learns then that Tory murdered his wife, Cally, and kills her in revenge before the downloading is complete. Feeling betrayed, the Cylons resume fighting; after the other Cylons in CIC are killed, Cavil commits suicide. At the same instant, a chance rock strike in the debris field causes Racetrack's dead hand to fall on the launch button for her Raptor's nuclear weapons, which were primed for launch before the Raptor's crew was lost. The missiles strike directly into the Colony, knocking it out of orbit. With Galactica still tangled in the Colony and being dragged toward the singularity along with it, Adama orders Starbuck to jump the ship away, anywhere. In a flash of inspiration, Starbuck mutters \\"there must be some kind of way out of here\\" and enters coordinates into the computer as if she were playing the mysterious music notes which Hera had written. Galactica jumps away and out of danger, leaving the Colony to fall to its destruction within the black hole. The war is over, and the Humans and their allies have prevailed. Galactica arrives at Kara's mysterious coordinates, its final destination as the damage caused in the battle has rendered the ship incapable of surviving any further jumps. Miraculously, the Galactica finds itself in orbit around a moon, close to a habitable world: our own Earth. Hours later, the rest of the fleet joins Galactica at this new world. Lee makes the unorthodox suggestion that they abandon their technology and start afresh, while Adama and others discover primitive humans already occupying the planet. Since finding Earth had always been the goal of the Colonial Fleet, Adama suggests they call this new planet \\"Earth\\". The survivors - Galactica's crew, the remaining inhabitants of the fleet, and the Cylon Twos, Sixes and Eights - take basic supplies and spread out across the planet - not to colonize and impose cities like the Twelve Colonies, but to blend in with primitive early humans, adding their own human and humanoid Cylon \\"genetics\\" to the early humans. Anders takes control of their abandoned fleet and pilots it into the Sun, so that the new arrivals \\"can give them the best part of ourselves... not the baggage... not the weapons... our hearts (rather than) our science\\". The Rebel Cylons decide that their Centurions have earned their freedom, and give them control of the Basestar, which jumps away to parts unknown. Baltar and Caprica Six are visited by their Inner messengers, who inform them that their destinies - to save Hera - have been fulfilled, and the two decide to live out the rest of their lives together. While resting under a tree, Roslin suddenly begins to have difficulty breathing. Adama quickly places her aboard a Raptor and says a short, final goodbye to Lee and Starbuck before taking off. While admiring the wildlife below and looking for a place to build a cabin for them, Roslin dies peacefully. While Lee expresses his desire to venture off and explore the planet, Starbuck, her destiny as an Angel fulfilled, literally vanishes without a trace. Lee promises to never forget her. Tyrol decides to settle by himself on a remote northern island (implied to be the Scottish highlands). Helo (Tahmoh Penikett), Athena and Hera are reunited as a family. Tigh and Ellen stay with the rest of the survivors. Adama eventually finds the place where he will build the cabin, and buries Laura on a nearby hillside. Epilogue New York City, 150,000 years later: humanity has reached the early 21st century, and the development of robotics and computerization continues unabated. Inner Baltar and Inner Six (no longer tied to the long- deceased Gaius Baltar and Caprica Six)This is consistent with Ronald D. Moore's statement in Battlestar Galactica: The Last Frakkin' Special that they are \\"... messenger(s) of a higher power\\" comment on the recent discovery of what is believed to be \\"mitochondrial Eve\\" in Tanzania... the remains of Hera Agathon, progenitor of modern-day humanity. Inner Six disagrees with her counterpart about humanity's next future: when a complex system repeats, something new is bound to happen, and this Earth‚Äîdescendants of devastated planets Kobol, the Twelve Colonies, and the original Earth‚Äîmay escape the vicious cycle of technology, surmising it to be a part of God's plan. Inner Baltar reminds her \\"It doesn't like that name,\\" as the two stroll away. The episode and series end with a montage juxtaposing how we mistreat fellow humans alongside the progress of robotics in modern society as a familiar song plays. Production An Actroid at the Expo 2005 in Aichi, Japan. Footage from the Expo was featured in the episode's epilogue. In the episode's podcast, Moore and his wife Terry commented that they had trouble scouring for robot footage and clearing rights-issues. They also described one of the robots as the \\"most disturbing\\" of the bunch. \\"She's freaky. She's a Six in the making\\". Several bars of Stu Phillips' original Battlestar Galactica theme are heard at several junctions in the show,Closing credits, including when Adama flies the last Viper off the Galactica, and when Anders flies the fleet into the sun. The final shot of the fleet leaving Earth's orbit is an exact recreation of the fleet stock shot from the original series. D'Anna Biers (played by Lucy Lawless) is the only Cylon not to appear in this episode, as her character had stayed on the original Cylon Earth at the end of \\"Sometimes a Great Notion.\\" Before entering coordinates on the FTL-drive control console, Starbuck says \\"[There] must be some kind of way out of here,\\" which is the opening lyric of Bob Dylan's song \\"All Along the Watchtower.\\" The coordinates she enters are revealed through flashbacks to be the numerical representation of the opening notes of that same tune. The song is a recurring motif throughout the fourth season, and the version sung by Jimi Hendrix is played at the end of the episode. The episode was partially shot in the area of Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada. The original cut of the episode (all three parts) ran over four hours long. Show creator Ronald D. Moore appears in a short cameo in the epilogue, as the long-haired man reading the fictional edition of National Geographic magazine in which the archaeological story is featured. Reception \\"Daybreak (Part 2)\\" was watched by 2.4 million total viewers, a 56% surge from the season three finale and the series' best numbers since the season 2.5 premiere, \\"Resurrection Ship, Part 1.\\" This led to a 1.7 household rating. The series finale also drew 1.5 million viewers in the key 18-to-49-year-old demographic, and 1.6 million viewers aged 25-to-54, the best in each demographic since \\"Resurrection Ship, Part 2.\\" The numbers do not take into account timeshifting via digital video recorders, which typically adds another 700,000 Battlestar Galactica viewers per episode. Critical reception of the finale varied. Alan Sepinwall of The Star Ledger wrote \\"so the amazing four-year journey of Battlestar Galactica comes to an end, and I feel very, very good about it‚Äìeven as I suspect others may not.\\" Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times praised Moore and the writing team for \\"not copping out\\" and commented that it was \\"hard to imagine a more visually and thematically satisfying finale\\". Richard Vine of The Guardian opined that \\"somehow, out of all the doom and gloom, death, destruction and nihilism we've had, Battlestar Galactica finished with something approaching a happy ending.\\" He concluded that the episode was ultimately satisfying, noting that \\"most of the major questions were dealt with in some form or another.\\" Mother Jones magazine noted that the finale did little to genuinely resolve many plotlines and subplots, and pondered the implications for the industry. Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald concluded that \\"The desire to wrap everything up in a neat package‚Äìwhich is so contrary to the spirit of this show‚Äìhobbled the series creators.\\" Salon Magazine contrasted the finale with the rest of the series noting that the episode finished with \\"40 minutes of speeches about lessons learned and the need to \\"break the cycle\\", the naivet√© of which did indeed feel like a break‚Äî from the knowing, worldly stoicism that made Battlestar Galactica so refreshing to begin with.\\" Time Magazine noted that it seemed hard to believe that an advanced culture would discard all of its technology. Renowned fantasy author George R.R. Martin expressed his extreme dissatisfaction, commenting: \\"Battlestar Galactica ends with 'God Did It.' Looks like somebody skipped Writing 101, when you learn that a deus ex machina is a crappy way to end a story. Yeah, yeah, sometimes the journey is its own reward. I certainly enjoyed much of the journey with BSG. But damn it, doesn't anybody know how to write an ending any more? Writing 101, kids. Adam and Eve, God Did It, It Was All a Dream? I've seen Clarion students left stunned and bleeding for turning in stories with those endings.\\" Martin's own book series Game of Thrones remains without resolution despite him beginning in 1991. Josh Tyler of Blend Magazine concluded that the final resolution lacked credibility, but that the simple drama of the episode was one reason to view it positively.

This relates to the engagement of spectators influencing and engaging with the performance as both spectators and actors, termed \\"spect-actors\\", with the power to stop and change the performance. As part of TO, the issues dealt with in forum theatre are often related to areas of social justice with aims to explore solutions to oppression featured in the performance. History In the 1960s, Augusto Boal and his theatre company the Teatro de Arena de S√£o Paulo travelled through some of the poorest places in Brazil, staging productions which urged action against various injustices and oppressors. These performances often ended with the actors exhorting their audiences of peasants to spill their own blood in this struggle. This continued until an encounter with a peasant who extended an invitation to the actors to take up arms against an oppressive landowner. The actors explained that their guns were fake, and that they would only be a hindrance, to which the peasant left after realising the actors weren‚Äôt willing to take the risks they were asking others to take. Realising he was not prepared to take the same risks he was asking others to, Boal decided to never again write plays which gave advice or sent ‚Äòmessages‚Äô. Later in 1973, while working within a theatre literacy project in Peru based on the teachings of Paulo Freire, Boal applied a form of theatre he titled 'simultaneous dramaturgy'. These plays were based around finding the solution to a problem posed at a moment of crisis for the protagonist. At this moment, the audience would be invited to suggest actions for the actor to perform to solve the problem, framed as a way of facilitating a learning environment (although the interpretation of suggestions was up to the actors). During one performance, a member of the audience couldn't have their idea interpreted by the actor to their satisfaction and so was invited on stage to perform their suggestion. It was out of these experiences that forum theatre was born, with the forum as part of the show. This changed the work of the artists to create a new space of collective learning between the artists and the community. Methodology Forum theatre begins with a short performance, either rehearsed or improvised, which contains demonstrations of social or political problems. At the conclusion, the play will begin again with the audience being able to replace or add to the characters on stage to present their interventions; alternate solutions to the problems faced. The presentations include one person who acts as the ‚Äòjoker‚Äô, a facilitator for the forum theatre session. They are to hold an impartial view of the interventions, ask the audience to evaluate what happened at the end of an intervention, facilitate the interventions such that each spect-actor is able to complete their intervention before another is free to enact their intervention, and to be watching out for interventions which are implausible and ask the audience to decide whether the intervention is a ‚Äòmagic‚Äô solution. Brazilian theater director and writer Augusto Boal presenting his Theatre of the Oppressed at Riverside Church in New York City Applications Some practice close to Boal's traditional method continues in the UK notably undertaken by Adrian Jackson, a translator of multiple works by Boal, and the founder of the Cardboard Citizens company. Canadian based theatre director David Diamond developed Theatre for Living techniques from Theatre of the Oppressed and practices Forum Theatre productions incorporating systems theory to the work. His work differs primarily in that the spectators are not required to replace a protagonist, but can replace any character - even the antagonists - if they can \\"identify with their struggle\\". ActNow Theatre is an example of an Australian theatre company creating Forum Theatre projects. There are multiple documented uses of forum theatre within the health sector and associated learning environments, such as its use as a teaching tool for medical students on professionalism, as a tool for developing communication skills within a medical context, and as an unintended effect of an intervention intended for medical staff, to engage patients with an understanding of medical decisions.

Beginning in the later half of 2008, a global-scale recession adversely affected the economy of the United States. A combination of several years of declining automobile sales and scarce availability of credit led to a more widespread crisis in the United States auto industry in the years of 2008 and 2009. Following dramatic drops in automobile sales throughout 2008, two of the \\"Big Three\\" U.S. automakers ‚Äì General Motors (GM), and Chrysler ‚Äì requested emergency loans in order to address impending cash shortages. By April 2009, the situation had worsened such that both GM and Chrysler were faced with imminent bankruptcy and liquidation. With the intent to prevent massive job losses and destabilizing damage to the entire manufacturing sector, the U.S. and Canadian governments provided unprecedented financial bailout ($85 billion) support to allow the companies to restructure and jettison legacy debt via Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Both companies separately filed for this protection by June 1. General Motors emerged from bankruptcy as a new company majority-owned by the United States Treasury, and Chrysler emerged owned primarily by the United Auto Workers union and by Italian automaker Fiat S.p.A.. Both companies terminated agreements with hundreds of their dealerships and GM discontinued several of its brands as part of bankruptcy proceedings. Ford Motor Company was able to survive without entering bankruptcy partly due to a large line of credit which it obtained in 2007. The U.S. automakers were more heavily affected by the crisis than their foreign counterparts, such as Toyota. Following the 2000s energy crisis, the U.S. automakers failed to produce more fuel-efficient vehicles as opposed to the high-profit sport utility vehicles that were popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s which led to excess inventory and undesirable product. Since the automotive crisis abated, all three American automakers have increased sales of vehicles and have posted a profit. As of 2012, the industry has recovered to some extent. GM had 2011 sales of more than 9 million vehicles, more than Toyota. According to a May 2011 report by the White House National Economic Council, however, the US government may have to write off about $14 billion of its $80 billion loan. By 2012, polls from Pew Research Center and Quinnipiac University Polling Institute show that the American public now believes that the bailouts have been helpful for the American economy. Background Some note that the crisis occurred mainly as a result of business of the Big Three U.S. automakers which had limited access to offshore production as opposed to their Asian counterparts. Analysts point out that Asian companies that manufacture automobiles mostly in Asia but also in the U.S. were not experiencing similar problems. They were able to produce compact automobiles in the Pacific Rim area for less cost (in Dollars).If You Like Michigan's Economy, You'll Love Obama's, Wall St. Journal, September 13, 2008Detroit: Same Old, Same Old , National Review, November 16, 2008 A December 22, 2008 article in The New York Times stated, \\"For the most part, the so-called auto transplants ‚Äì foreign- owned car companies with major operations in the United States ‚Äì have deep pockets and ample credit, and they are not facing potential bankruptcy like General Motors and Chrysler.\\" Much of the criticism centered on structural differences between the Big Three and the \\"transplants\\" (foreign companies manufacturing in U.S.) that result in major cost differentials.

The U.S. automakers also suffered from considerably higher labor costs than their non-unionized counterparts, including salaries, benefits, healthcare, and pensions. In return for labor peace, management granted concessions to its unions that resulted in uncompetitive cost structures and significant legacy costs. Further, the volume of cars sold in the U.S. was significantly tied to home equity lines of credit, with 24% of sales financed this way in 2006. When the availability of these loans suddenly dried up in 2008 due to the subprime mortgage crisis, vehicle sales declined dramatically, from 17 million in 2006 to 10.6 million in 2009. In 2006, Consumer Reports reported that all 10 of the cars that it considered to be the 10 best were built by Japanese companies.Autos: Consumer Reports Top Car Picks All Japanese, ABC News, March 2, 2006. While Michigan lost 83,000 Big Three auto manufacturing jobs between 1993 and 2008, more than 91,000 new auto manufacturing jobs were created in Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and Texas during that same time period.If You Like Michigan's Economy, You'll Love Obama's, Wall St. Journal, September 13, 2008. Note that 83,000 jobs were lost in Michigan and there is not a reference to automotive jobs lost in other states. Center for Automotive Research estimated that for every job created by a foreign transplant, 6.1 jobs were lost by the Big Three. The support given to General Motors and Chrysler by the Obama Administration was initially unpopular, with a March 2009 CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll finding that only 37% of Americans approved of the actions. A June 2009 Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey found 39% approval. However, two polls taken three years after the event show that Americans did eventually support the auto bailout. An April 2012 poll by Quinnipiac University Polling Institute shows that 53% of American voters support the bailout, and 50% believe it has been a success. A Pew Research Center poll from February 2012 shows that 56% of adults polled now believe that the government giving loans to General Motors and Chrysler was \\"good for the economy\\". Industry and labor statistics At the time, the Big Three employees, parts-supplier employees and car-dealer employees totaled approximately 1.6 million. All auto-related industries and after-market service businesses employed approximately 3.1 million people in the United States. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics breaks down the workers into the following segments, as of September 2008: Parts manufacturing-504,000; Repair operations-864,000; Wholesale operations-340,000; Dealer operations-1.2 million; and Manufacturing-114,000. GM directly employs 123,000 in all of North America. An estimated two million people relied on the industry for health care and 775,000 retirees collect auto-industry pensions. Hourly wages and benefits Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution argued that hourly wages were similar between the Big Three and the transplants. \\"The basic hourly wage received by a UAW worker in a Big Three plant is close to that received by a Toyota or Honda worker in a U.S. plant. The UAW-negotiated wage was roughly $28 an hour in 2007. For new workers, the hourly wage was lower at $14 an hour; senior workers made more money. The major cost difference between UAW members and employees in foreign- nameplate factories in the U.S. comes in fringe benefits. The UAW has been one of the more successful American unions in fighting for generous pensions and health benefits for its members.\\" Dan Ikenson of the Cato Institute argued that \\"total compensation is the cost of labor to the companies, and for GM it is about $73 per hour and for Toyota about $48. The average cost differential between the Big Three and all the foreign nameplate companies is about $30 per hour. That's huge.\\" His computation includes all labor-related costs (e.g.., wages, healthcare, and pension‚Äîfor both current workers and retirees.) Andrew Sorkin of The New York Times indicated that GM and Chrysler pay $10‚Äì20 more per hour than transplants; this was vigorously disputed by David Cole of the Center for Automotive Research. Average annual wages for production workers at the Big Three were $67,480 in 2007, and $81,940 for skilled workers. In Canada, GM's 2008 average labor costs (including both wages and benefits) were $69 per hour, and Toyota's at $48 per hour, with similar productivity. According to the Heritage Foundation, the ratio of retirees to workers varies across the Big Three. For each active worker at GM, there were 3.8 retirees or dependents in 2006. At Chrysler, there were 2.0 and at Ford there were 1.6. This means the legacy labor cost burden for GM is significantly greater than its competitors. Peter Morici, a professor at the University of Maryland, College Park's school of business, testified that the extremely high labor and product development costs will keep the Big Three from developing the high quality vehicles needed to become profitable and surviving. The Asian-owned companies' U.S. employees are mainly non-unionized; the Big Three are bound by contracts with the UAW. According to the UAW, labor cost represented 8.4% of the total cost of manufacturing and selling an automobile in 2006. \\"The vast majority of the costs of producing a vehicle and transporting it to a dealership and preparing it for sale ‚Äì including design, engineering, marketing, raw materials, executive compensation and other costs ‚Äì are not related to direct or indirect manufacturing labor.\\"UAW ‚Äì FAQ Jared Bernstein, the chief economist of Vice President Joe Biden, noted in an April 7, 2009 interview that most of the concessions that the UAW made in the 2007 contract applied only to new hires. Older workers \\"still benefit from contracts that were signed a long time ago.\\" Jobs bank costs The Detroit News published a story in 2005 on how the Big Three U.S. automakers paid more than 12,000 idled employees their full salary and benefits in \\"jobs bank\\" programs. The program was established in the 1984 UAW labor contracts with the Big Three to protect workers' salaries and discourage layoffs, as part of the automakers' contracts with the UAW. The union's intent was to protect jobs via a plan to guarantee pay and benefits for union members whose jobs were extinguished by technological progress or plant restructurings. In most cases, workers are paid via the jobs bank only after exhausting government and company unemployment benefits. Some of those workers were placed in retraining. As a result of the jobs banks, the U.S. automakers are contractually obligated to pay 85‚Äì95 percent of union wages and benefits to members of the United Auto Workers union who aren't working ‚Äì even if their plants have been closed. In the agreement, GM would to allocate $2.1 billion in jobs bank payments over four years, Chrysler $451 million for its program along with another $50 million for salaried union employees, and Ford agreed to set aside $944 million. Peter Morici, a professor at the University of Maryland, College Park's school of business, testified that the jobs bank was one of the biggest problems that the Big Three face, saying \\"Right now if a plant closes in St. Louis and a new one opens in Kansas City, the workers don't have to move from St. Louis to Kansas City; they can opt to get a $105,000 payout or go on Jobs Bank where they can collect 95 percent of pay for the rest of their lives.\\" Number of brands GM had eight brands sold in the United States (not including its overseas brands Vauxhaul, Opel, Holden and at the time GM Daewoo which is now called GM Korea) until it sold three and liquidated one of those brands during bankruptcy, leaving four (Chevrolet, Cadillac, GMC and Buick), while Toyota has only three. More brands require additional marketing and product development expenditures, which drives incremental costs relative to the competition. One analyst estimated that reducing GM brands from 8 to 3 would save $5 billion annually. However, reducing the number of brands required closing or consolidation of dealerships, which due to state franchise laws is very expensive. For example, GM's retirement of the Oldsmobile brand cost nearly $2 billion. Number and control of dealerships GM and Chrysler have nearly 10,000 dealerships between them, employing an estimated 500,000 people. GM has many more, smaller dealerships spread across its eight brands than Toyota. Dealerships are protected by state laws that make them difficult to close without paying large fees. This makes dealership reform challenging without bankruptcy protection. Bondholders GM was carrying a $43 billion debt burden, with nearly $3 billion per year in interest costs. If bondholders swapped stakes for common stock (equity) which pays no interest, GM's debt and interest burden would be substantially reduced. However, bondholders of both Chrysler and GM rejected the debt swap offers, complaining of unequal treatment compared to the UAW, citing that their outstanding debt was more than double that of the UAW's health care trust. The UAW had been offered 50% and 40% stakes in the new Chrysler and GM, respectively, while the bondholders would have received 33 cents on the U.S. dollar for Chrysler and 10% of the new GM (an analyst stated that the GM offer would be projected to recover 24 cents on the dollar). With the approval of the Treasury, the offer for bondholders was later amended to include warrants for a further 15% stake. Bondholders complained of US government interference that bypassed the higher precedence of debtholder claims to favour the UAW, due to the UAW's political contributions to President Barack Obama. One lawyer for the Chrysler bondholders stated that auto task force head Steve Rattner had ignored negotiation requests from the bondholders committee, while Rattner also threatened to destroy one of the bondholder's reputation for holding out. One GM bondholder described this as the socialist state intervention typical of Hugo Chavez's Venezuela, saying \\"This is the kind of stuff you'd expect from a banana republic. Not from the United States.\\" Obama publicly accused Chrysler bondholders of being speculators, after they rejected the last offer which caused Chrysler to file for bankruptcy, with some of them receiving death threats after a bankruptcy judge refused to protect their anonymity. The hedge funds stated that their clients included pension funds and university endowments. Around $7 billion USD of GM bonds are held by \\"Mom and Pop-type investors\\", with one lawyer describing it as autoworker retirees versus retirees. Not surprisingly, any recapitalization (typically through bankruptcy) would all but wipe out the value of existing common stock shares, which had already declined significantly. Economic impact Claims that failure would be harmful to economy The auto industry is a key component of the U.S. economy. Economists used 2007‚Äì2008 data to build estimates of what a shutdown would cost in summer 2008, in order to set benchmarks to help policy makers understand the impact of bankruptcies. Such estimates were widely discussed among policy makers in late 2008.See Wall Street Journal video Nov 14, 2008. Closing the Big Three would mean loss of 240,000 very highly paid jobs at the Big Three,U.S. wages for production workers at the Big Three were $67,480 in 2007, and $81,940 for skilled workers. CAR Research Memorandum. \\"The Impact of the U.S. Economy of a Major Contraction of the Detroit Three Automakers\\" (Nov. 4, 2008) p. 7. A new union agreement calls for much lower rage rates to go into effect in 2010. online edition a loss of 980,000 highly paid jobs at the suppliers and local dealers, plus the loss of 1.7 million additional jobs throughout the economy‚Äîa total loss of 3 million jobs. Estimates were that a Big Three shutdown would cause a decline in personal income of $151 billion the first year, and $398 billion over three years. The federal, state and local governments would lose tax revenue, and instead spend on welfare programs a total of $156 billion over three years.If there is a 50% decline in the Big Three, the negative consequences include a loss of 2.5 million jobs, a decline of $276 billion in personal income over three years and a cost to the government of $108 billion. CAR Research Memorandum. \\"The Impact of the U.S. Economy of a Major Contraction of the Detroit Three Automakers\\" (Nov. 4, 2008) online edition Economist David Wyss of S&P; has posited that if GM and Chrysler disappear, there could be an increase of about 1 million imported cars every year, which would remove about $25 billion from the U.S. economy. That would reduce GDP by 0.2 percentage points annually‚Äîexcluding the impact of lost jobs (higher unemployment) and wages. Claims that failure would not be harmful to economy In a November 19, 2008 CNBC article, Jordan Kimmel, a fund manager at Magnet Investing in Randolph, New Jersey, said that if the Big Three automakers were liquidated or completely shut down, foreign companies such as Honda and Toyota would open up new manufacturing plants in the U.S., and there would be no long term loss in employment or damage to the economy.No Auto Bailout? Investors May Just Say 'No Problem' , CNBC, November 19, 2008. Michael Schuman of Time Magazine stated that although a giant corporation failing would be ugly, it is better than artificially keeping it alive without a prospect of improvement. He compared the possible collapse of the U.S. domestic automakers to the 1999 dismantling of the Daewoo Group in South Korea. Daewoo's proportionate economic impact on Korea was larger than that of the Big Three to the United States. The persistence of the belief that Daewoo and other Korean conglomerates were too big to fail led many bankers and investors to continually waste money on bailouts, despite their poor business plans and unprofitable projects, as Daewoo was unable to repay these loans. Once the too-big-to-fail perception was dispelled, with large conglomerates no longer considered the safest investments, bankers and investors began financing new opportunities in areas which had been starved of capital (small firms, entrepreneurs and consumers), while Korea's GDP actually rose after Daewoo's unwinding. Schuman also noted a similar analogy with Japan during its Lost Decade of the 1990s, where banks kept injecting new funds into unprofitable \\"zombie firms\\" to keep them afloat, arguing that they were too big to fail. However, most of these companies were too debt-ridden to do much more than survive on further bailouts, which led to an economist describing Japan as a \\"loser's paradise.\\" Schuman states that Japan's economy did not begin to recover until this practice had ended. Restructuring process alternatives Industry experts, academics, and media outlets made a variety of recommendations regarding reforming or restructuring the Big Three. Many of these include bankruptcy, a court-supervised method of reorganizing or shutting down a company. Bankruptcy and alternatives Bankruptcy discussions centered around the prospect of Chapter 11 bankruptcy, commonly called restructuring, commonly used to provide a window of opportunity for a corporation to renegotiate contracts, sell assets or component businesses for cash, obtain debt forgiveness, or otherwise reform itself as a viable business enterprise. The alternative, Chapter 7 bankruptcy, is used to shut down and liquidate an enterprise and sell off the pieces, with the proceeds going to the debt holders. Under both types of bankruptcy, the shareholders typically lose their investment and debt holders obtain control of the corporation. During November 2008, the debate involved whether a Chapter 11 filing would be beneficial or feasible. Arguments in favor of Chapter 11 bankruptcy In a November 19, 2008, editorial in Forbes, Blythe McGarvie said that bankruptcy would allow the automobile industry to become more competitive and sustainable, and cited the airline industry bankruptcy as an example.The U.S. Economy Doesn't Need GM, Forbes, November 19, 2008. Wharton finance professor Jeremy Siegel, author of the book \\"The Future for Investors,\\" asserted that Chapter 11 bankruptcy would allow Detroit to reorganize but not cause the massive job losses feared by some. \\"Any bailout of the auto industry is really a bailout for the health benefits of the UAW. That's all it is.\\" Opponents of a bailout believe that the automakers' problems could be more efficiently resolved by a bankruptcy court with legal power to dissolve existing contracts, shedding costs, and debts that it can no longer afford. They suggested that a government \\"car czar\\" would be ineffective since their actions could be swayed by Washington politics. Former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, running in the Republican Party presidential primaries, 2012, confirmed that he had favored bankruptcy rather than government aid to the industry, though he had favored the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) as a whole.Haberman, Maggie, \\"New Hampshire debate: Mitt Romney talks against auto bailout\\", Politico, October 11, 2011. Retrieved February 16, 2012. Arguments against Chapter 11 bankruptcy Critics of Chapter 11 Bankruptcy as a restructuring process argued that consumers would be unwilling to purchase a car from a bankrupt automaker, as the ability of the automaker to support the warranty is key to the purchase decision. Advocates have argued that the government or private lenders could establish a fund to enable warranty coverage. GM argued that a bankruptcy would threaten jobs and the solvency of the U.S. federal government's Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). PBGC Director has said: \\"GM has not been able to give us a straight answer about the funded status of their pension plan. We can't successfully monitor the situation if they are not responsive.\\" GM's pension fund had enough money for current obligations, but a report issued by the Deutsche Bank estimates that the pension may be $18 billion under-funded by the end of 2008. Feasibility of a prepackaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy A \\"prepackaged\\" Chapter 11 bankruptcy means that the key stakeholders have agreed in advance what will happen during the bankruptcy proceedings, which enables greater certainty regarding the outcome and less time spent in bankruptcy protection. Advocates have indicated this would be preferable, while critics argued it was unlikely that all of the stakeholders could agree on terms while outside of bankruptcy. Government facilitated sale of assets The Brookings Institution advocated a government-facilitated solution in which Big Three assets are transferred or sold to other firms better able to deploy the plant and employee resources. \\"[The] most constructive role the government can play at this point is to provide a short-term infusion of capital with strict repayment rules that will essentially require the auto makers to sell off their assets to other, successful companies.\\" The authors argued that the Big Three make automobiles that not enough Americans want to buy, which cannot be solved by a bankruptcy restructuring focused initially on cost-side considerations like wages and benefits. Government facilitated restructuring Economist and author Jeffrey Sachs has advocated a government and private industry partnership to transform the automotive industry, creating a \\"high mileage vehicle economy\\" based on hybrid and fuel cell cars. Loans would be provided immediately, with conditions. He advocates a U.S. strategy of automotive technological leadership, which would \\"dramatically improve energy and national security, climate security, and U.S. global competitiveness.\\" Arguments against government intervention On November 24, 2008, Congressman Ron Paul (R-TX) wrote, \\"In bailing out failing companies, they are confiscating money from productive members of the economy and giving it to failing ones. By sustaining companies with obsolete or unsustainable business models, the government prevents their resources from being liquidated and made available to other companies that can put them to better, more productive use. An essential element of a healthy free market, is that both success and failure must be permitted to happen when they are earned. But instead with a bailout, the rewards are reversed ‚Äì the proceeds from successful entities are given to failing ones. How this is supposed to be good for our economy is beyond me ... It won't work. It can't work ... It is obvious to most Americans that we need to reject corporate cronyism, and allow the natural regulations and incentives of the free market to pick the winners and losers in our economy, not the whims of bureaucrats and politicians.\\"The Bailout Surge , by Ron Paul, 11-24-2008. In a December 17, 2008 opinion column, economist Thomas Sowell said that there was no bailout for the horse and buggy industry 100 years ago when it was replaced by the automobile, and that the overall standard of living is higher when winners and losers are determined by customers instead of by politicians. He also blamed the decline of the Big Three on the economic policies of the \\"rust belt\\" states, and said that Japanese car companies preferred to build factories in other U.S. states that were not so hostile to businesses. In a June 16, 2009 report Ernst & Young stated: \\"Policies that protect firms or industries can result in reduced incentives for entrepreneurs to invest in innovative ideas and for large firms to invest in R&D; because they no longer face the competitive pressure to constantly improve their product in order to improve (or maintain) their market share.\\" Changes to management and board Critics argued for the removal of General Motors' senior management. Such removal is typical in a bailout. Mergers One or more of the Big Three could have merged, enabling cost savings and focusing on the most profitable brands. However, the UAW and CAW opposed this move, as it would certainly involve layoffs. GM and Chrysler held talks which ultimately went to nothing, with Chrysler, as of June 10, 2009, a fully owned subsidiary of Italian automaker Fiat. Comparison with British Leyland The comparison was made with the situation of British Leyland (itself an amalgamation of many car makers similar to General Motors) in the 1970s, which at the time had a 36% market share in the UK. During that period, the UK government nationalised and invested several billion pounds into the ailing business; faced with competition from Mainland Europe and questionable build quality, the business struggled to compete. While the business slimmed its product line, concentrated mainly on the profitable Austin and Rover brands and by the 1980s had some successful models such as the Austin Metro, the brand ended up being broken up and is now owned by Nanjing Automobile and has largely been dismantled. Federal government bailout process and timeline On November 19, 2008, there was a United States Senate hearing on the automotive crisis in the presence of the heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors. The auto manufacturers explained that they would need financial aid of $25 billion if they were to avoid bankruptcy. The Senate was divided on the issue. The Republican senators were unwilling to provide aid, some even suggesting that bankruptcy might be the best option as it would free manufacturers from the employment deals agreed with the unions. The Democrats, however, continued to insist that action needed to be taken quickly, in line with President-elect Obama's stance on the matter.Senators cool to pleas by big three carmakers. Financial Times site. Retrieved November 20, 2008. Rick Wagoner, head of General Motors, estimated that there could be a loss of 3 million jobs within the first year if the auto industry failed. \\"This is all about a lot more than just Detroit. It's about saving the U.S. economy from a catastrophic collapse,\\" he said. At the November 19, 2008 hearing, Gary Ackerman (D-NY) said, \\"Maybe you can tell us what you're actually going to do to sell cars people want,\\" and Michael Capuano (D-Mass) said, \\"My fear is you're going to take this money and continue the same stupid decisions you've made for 25 years.\\"More trouble for auto bailout, CNN, November 19, 2008.

Ford shares also fell drastically.GM shares hit lowest price since Great Depression. Yahoo business news. November 20, 2008. Once rumors of bipartisan progress on some kind of a bailout began to circle, share prices of these companies recovered. A November 20, 2008 Detroit Free Press article said that the UAW was considering ending its jobs bank program as a condition for a federal bailout.UAW may give up jobs bank to revive auto loans, Detroit Free Press, November 20, 2008. Democratic Congressional party leaders Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid sent a letter to the CEO's of the Big Three automakers calling on these leaders to present by December 2, 2008, a \\"credible restructuring plan\\" involving \\"significant sacrifices and major changes to [the] way of doing business,\\" to qualify for further government assistance. The letter included a variety of principles and requirements, including a situation assessment, forecasts under various assumptions, taxpayer protection, transparent reporting to an oversight body, dividend and executive pay restrictions, and approach to covering healthcare and pension obligations. On December 2, 2008, the Big Three submitted revised plans to Congress which apparently included more drastic measures such as the lowering of executive pay, reducing the number of brands and refinancing company debt. It emerged that the total amount of the bailout requested had now risen to $34 billion. Painting an even more dramatic picture of what would happen if Congress did not respond quickly, Chrysler said it would need $7 billion by the end of the month just to keep running while GM asked for $4 billion immediately. In an interview that was broadcast on NBC's Meet The Press on December 7, 2008, President-elect Barack Obama said, \\"The last thing I want to see happen is for the auto industry to disappear, but I'm also concerned that we don't put $10 billion or $20 billion or $30 billion or whatever billion dollars into an industry, and then, six months to a year later, they come back hat in hand and say, \`Give me more.'\\"Obama suggests some auto execs should lose jobs, Associated Press, December 7, 2008. Congressional bailout bill On December 9, 2008, negotiators revealed the terms of an emerging deal between the White House and Congress under which a short-term $15 billion bailout for the Big Three would be overseen by a federal \\"car czar\\" or trustee. On December 10, 2008, the House Financial Services Committee released a copy of the proposed financial bailout packageAuto Industry Financing and Restructuring Act, House Financial Services Committee, Dec. 10, 2008 for GM, Ford, and Chrysler. The bill proposed the appointment of a 'car czar' to oversee automakers' restructuring efforts, and restrictions on executive bonuses, golden parachute packages and required automakers to sell or divest themselves of any privately owned or leased aircraft. Senate rejects bailout On December 11, the bill failed to pass, losing 52‚Äì35 on a Senate procedural vote. A statement from GM expressed its deep disappointment with the failure and said, \\"We will assess all of our options to continue our restructuring and to obtain the means to weather the current economic crisis.\\" Chrysler said that it \\"is obviously disappointed in what transpired in the Senate and will continue to pursue a workable solution to help ensure the future viability of the company.\\" Bush approves bailout On December 19, George W. Bush announced that he had approved the bailout plan, which would give loans of $17.4 billion to U.S. automakers GM and Chrysler, stating that under present economic conditions, \\"allowing the U.S. auto industry to collapse is not a responsible course of action.\\" Bush provided $13.4 billion now, with another $4 billion available in February 2009. Funds would be made available from the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. General Motors would get $9.4 billion, and Chrysler $4 billion. However, it had been argued that the Treasury lacked the statutory authority to direct TARP funds to the automakers, since TARP is limited to \\"financial institutions\\" under Section 102 of the TARP. It was also argued that providing TARP funds to automaker's financing operations, such as GMAC, runs counter to the intent of Congress for limiting TARP funds to true \\"financial institutions\\". On December 19, 2008, President Bush used his executive authority to declare that TARP funds may be spent on any program he personally deems necessary to avert the financial crisis, and declared Section 102 to be nonbinding. The federal loan would prevent General Motors from going into immediate bankruptcy. The bailout required both companies to dramatically restructure their operations to demonstrate long-term viability. In February 2009, the Obama administration would determine the automakers' progress in meeting the conditions of the loans, and then decide whether to supply more government aid or to force automakers to repay the loans and face bankruptcy. The loans would carry an interest rate of 5 percent but may rise to 10 percent if the auto manufacturers default on them. Presidential task force on the auto industry Under the Obama Administration, the idea of a car czar was considered and ultimately abandoned in favor of joint Lawrence Summers/Timothy Geithner oversight of a possible second round of lending to the auto companies. In mid-February, the auto companies GM and Chrysler applied for additional funds. The task force was formed in February 2009 instead, and began meetings at that time.David Shepardson and Gordon Trowbridge. \\"Auto task force taking shape\\" February 21, 2009. Second bailout On February 18, 2009, General Motors and Chrysler again approached the U.S. government, in regard to obtaining a second bridging loan of $21.6 billion (¬£15.2 billion). $16.6 billion of this would go to General Motors, while Chrysler would take $5 billion. General Motors agreed to shed 47,000 jobs, close five plants, and axe 12 car models. Chrysler agreed to cut 3,000 jobs, cut one shift from production, and axe three car models. General Motors was also looking to sell its Swedish subsidiary, Saab. GM made no mention of plans for its German subsidiary, Opel, or its British subsidiary, Vauxhall. Obama address to joint session of Congress In his joint address to Congress in 2009, Obama stated that > We will invest fifteen billion dollars in technologies like ... more > efficient cars and trucks built right here in America. As for auto industry, > everyone recognizes that years of bad decision-making and global recession > have pushed our automakers to the brink. We should not, and will not, > protect them from their own bad practices. But we are committed to the goal > of a re-tooled, re-imagined auto industry that can compete and win. Millions > of jobs depend on it. Scores of communities depend on it. And I believe the > nation that invented the automobile cannot walk from it Chrysler bankruptcy On April 30, 2009, Chrysler filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after talks with lenders broke down. On the May 14, 2009 Chrysler announced it was to close 25% of its US dealerships as part of its restructuring process. General Motors bankruptcy Only days after approaching the U.S. Government to seek further funding, General Motors published its losses for the final quarter of 2008 to be at $9.6 billion (¬£6.7 billion). This brought its overall 2008 losses to $30.9 billion. In 2007, General Motors made a loss of $38.7 billion. In the light of the published losses GM has conceded that it expected auditors to question its future viability when it releases its annual report in March. On the June 1, 2009, General Motors filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after failing to successfully negotiate deals with bond holders. On the day the application was made, General Motors was largely a nationalized institution (the U.S. government owning 60% and the Canadian 12.5%), the remaining private stakes mainly being owned by employees. The application to a court in New York marked the largest failure of an industrial company in US history. The restructuring would drastically change General Motors, with at least 20,000 US employees likely to lose their jobs. General Motors had previously announced that another nine plants will be closed while three more will be idled. GM's chief executive Fritz Henderson appealed to customers to give the company another chance, claiming \\"the GM that let too many of you down is now history\\".

Some ecology- minded American view with little sympathy the big automakers' reputation for maximizing profits at the environment's expense, and often believe they deliberately destroying mass-transport systems and privately owned railways between the 1920s and 1960s. Some have alleged that The Big Three contributed to the development of suburbs, seen as fuel-inefficient in that it requires commuters to drive to cities from increasingly more distant suburbs. Facing a saturated car market in the U.S. in the early 1920s, GM engaged in a controversial policy along with road-builders that triggered the massive shift from the mass transportation of the previous century to the \\"one-person-one- car\\" trip of today.

Lobbying and other financial ties between Big Three and Congress The Big Three spent almost $50 million to lobby Congress during the first nine months of 2008. Senator Carl Levin (D-Michigan) received $438,304 over 30 years, or $14,610 a year. House member John Dingell (D-Michigan) received nearly $1 million over his 54 years in Congress, or $18,518 a year. House member Joe Knollenberg (R-Michigan) received $879,327 over only 16 years in office, or $54,957 a year. Dingell's wife Debbie used to work as a lobbyist for General Motors, and after she married Dingell, she became a senior GM executive at an undisclosed salary. As of May 2008, Dingell owned GM stock worth up to $350,000, GM stock options worth up to $1 million more, and a GM pension fund. In 2000, the Dingells owned GM stock options worth up to $5 million. In 1998, Dingell sold GM stock options worth up to $1 million.Big Three Spending Millions On Lobbying, CBS News, December 3, 2008. The value of that stock, options and pension has been lost in the bankruptcy restructuring that Congress approved for GM. GM sent letters to tens of thousands of their dealers, supplier executives, employees and union members, asking recipients to call and write Congress with several \\"talking points\\" about the potential effects of a GM bankruptcy. Corporate turnaround proposals and strategies Products: electric and hybrid vehicles The Chevrolet Volt Detroit's \\"Big Three\\" automakers went to Washington, D.C., on December 2 (arriving in Washington in hybrids after being criticized for traveling to the earlier November Senate hearing in private jets) to present their long-term viability plans to the United States Congress, and those plans included significant commitments to fuel-saving and electric vehicle technologies. Ford Motor Company unveiled an aggressive plan to electrify its fleet of vehicles, including plans to offer an all-electric van-type vehicle in 2010 for use in commercial fleets, complemented by a battery-powered sedan in 2011. By 2012, the company will bring a family of regular hybrids, plug-in hybrids, and battery electric vehicles to market. Ford intends to invest about $14 billion on fuel-efficient technologies over the next seven years and aims to achieve a 36% improvement in fuel economy for its entire fleet by the 2015 model year. The company has applied to DOE's Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program for $5 billion to support these efforts, but the company also sought up to $9 billion in bridge loans. However, Ford expected to remain viable through 2009 and hopes to avoid drawing on the loan. GM unveiled the production version of the Chevy Volt in September. The vehicle will be able to travel up to 40 miles in all-electric mode. General Motors Corporation (GM) is involved in a well- publicized effort to launch its plug-in hybrid model, the Chevy Volt, in 2010, and the company also intends to employ the Volt drivetrain in other vehicles. GM plans to launch predominately fuel-efficient cars and crossovers over the next four years, investing $2.9 billion in fuel-efficient technologies and alternative fuels during that time period. By 2012, GM will offer 15 hybrid models, and more than half of its fleet will be flex-fuel vehicles, able to run on either gasoline or ethanol-rich E85. GM is seeking $12 billion in bridge loans through 2009 and is also asking for revolving credit of $6 billion that it could draw on if its sales forecast falls short. The company ended the third quarter of the year with cash reserves of $16 billion, but it estimates that it should have at least $11 billion on hand to maintain its operations. Without a federal loan, GM expects its cash reserves to fall to $10.1 billion by year's end and to fall to $3.6 billion by February. Chrysler LLC predicted that for the 2009 model year, 73% of its vehicles will be more fuel efficient than their 2008 models, and the company planned to launch more small, fuel-efficient vehicles in the future. The company's plan also called for the introduction of a Dodge Ram hybrid in 2010, along with the company's first electric-drive vehicle. Chrysler also planned to offer three additional electric-drive vehicles by 2013. And like GM, Chrysler planned to make half of its fleet flex-fuel capable by 2012. The company sought a bridge loan of $7 billion. Chrysler ended the first half of the year with $9.4 billion in cash, but expected to end the year with only $2.5 billion in cash, and was concerned that it might not make it through the first quarter of 2009 without the loan. Automakers have already submitted applications for more than $20 billion in retooling loans to pay for fuel efficient vehicle projects. Production capacity: factory closings Ford's Twin Cities Assembly Plant in Minnesota was closed in 2011 On December 12, 2008, General Motors announced that it was temporarily closing 20 factories in North America. On December 17, Chrysler announced it would idle all 30 of its plants for at least one month. GM will invest $1 billion of bailout money in Brazil A February 2, 2009 article in the Latin American Herald Tribune said that General Motors would invest $1 billion in Brazil, and that this money is part of the bailout that it received from the U.S. government.\\"General Motors to Invest $1 Billion in Brazil Operations ‚Äì Money to Come from U.S. Rescue Program\\". Latin American Herald Tribune, February 2, 2009. Brand consolidation General Motors' plan was to consolidate their portfolio of US brands, concentrating on the Cadillac, Chevrolet, Buick and GMC brands, while phasing out, or possibly selling their Pontiac, Hummer and Saturn brands. On June 2, GM Motors announced the sale of the Hummer brand of off-road vehicles to Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery Company Ltd, a deal that fell through after failing to obtain Chinese regulatory approvals. The last Hummer H3 rolled off the line at Shreveport on May 24, 2010.

He made several trips to South Africa on the ships Maastricht and Vrede and in 1641 he was made captain of the 40-gun Vogelstruys of the VOC's Amsterdam Chamber, which was seconded to Michiel de Ruyter's fleet in 1652 during the First Anglo-Dutch War (with Aukes thus indirectly becoming a naval officer). At one point during the Battle of Plymouth he wandered from the Dutch fleet and was almost surrounded by English ships, but Aukes threatened to ignite a powder keg and blow up the ship, rather than surrender. His crew then managed to beat off an English boarding party, almost sink two English ships, badly damage a third and finally regain the main Dutch fleet. After the war Aukes continued as a VOC captain, being mentioned in a 1657 document as the captain of a koopvaarder (merchant ship) trading with the Levant and in one from 1665 as a merchant in Amsterdam. When Tjerk Hiddes de Vries was killed in 1666, during the Second Anglo-Dutch War, Aukes was requested to replace him as lieutenant-admiral in the Admiralty of Friesland by the States of Friesland, but Aukes declined, being then on the return voyage from India, during which he died.

Kroon also graduated from the Koninklijke Militaire School (Royal Military School, which trains NCO's) in Weert, and from the Koninklijke Militaire Academie (Royal Military Academy, which trains officers) in Breda. Military career Marines After graduating from high school in 1989, Kroon started his military career as a Marine in the Royal Netherlands Marine Corps. In 1991 he was dispatched for Operation Provide Comfort, a humanitarian operation for Kurds in northern Iraq. After this he was transferred for a year to the Marine Barracks Savaneta in Aruba. In 1993 he was sent out a second time as assistant section leader in a Marine platoon for the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) in Cambodia. Army After this mission in Cambodia he transferred to the Army where he started training for a position as an NCO at the Koninklijke Militaire School in Weert. After graduating he became squad leader at the 17th Armoured Infantry Battalion in Oirschot. With this unit he left for a mission in Bosnia for six months leading an infantry group. In 1998 he transferred to the Korps Commandotroepen (Corps of Commando Troops) in Roosendaal. After successfully earning his Green Beret he fulfilled a management position in the corps. In 2000 he once again left for Bosnia, this time as a member of the Joint Commissioned Observer mission. After this mission he left again for the Koninklijke Militaire Academie (Royal Military Academy) in Breda, to become an officer. After graduation he returned to his unit, the 17th Armoured Infantry Battalion, and left for Bosnia for the third time, now as platoon commander, in the Stabilization Force (SFOR) mission. In 2004 he returned to the Special Forces in Roosendaal as platoon commander at the 108th Commando Company. Here he had several management positions and was dispatched once again to Iraq in 2004 for mission Stabilisation Force Iraq and three times to Afghanistan (2005, 2006 en 2007). After that Kroon became a staff officer at the intelligence centre of the special forces, training other commandos, testing equipment and tactical procedures. On 12 July 2012, Kroon received a new command as company commander of the Charley Company of the 17th Mechanized Infantry Battalion ‚ÄòPrinses Irene‚Äô Fusilier Guards Regiment based in Oirschot. On 4 November 2013, Kroon returned to the Korps Commandotroepen (Corps of Commando Troops) in Roosendaal. On the 24th of Februari the Telegraaf newspaper published an article about Kroon. It claimed that Captain Kroon would be joining the Dutch mission in Mali (MINUSMA). Based in Gao, in a staff function as a planner for the 105th Commando Troop Compagny, his job will be mainly planning long range reconnaissance missions. This news was confirmed by the commander of the Korps Commando Troepen, Colonel Jan Swillens. In November 2014 Kroon was promoted to major and assigned to the Land Training Centre in Amersfoort. Military William Order Kroon being awarded by Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands From March 2006, to August 2006, Kroon, then a lieutenant, was dispatched to the Afghan province of Uruzgan. His job, as platoon commander of the Dutch special forces unit \\"Viper\\", was to reconnoiter and to map the area so that Task Force Uruzgan could be established. In this period he distinguished himself by exceptional deeds during six extremely dangerous actions which broke out during ISAF patrols by \\"Viper\\" and a platoon of the Australian Special Air Service Regiment. Previously knighted members of the Military William Order attending the presentation ceremony on 29 May 2009. One of these actions was Operation Chitag (13‚Äì14 July 2006). During the patrol, Kroon encountered a group of Taliban fighters. In the ensuing battle, while the Dutch troops were heavily outnumbered, Kroon was forced to request air support on his own position by a Lockheed AC-130 gunship; he ordered his men to take cover and with his Forward Air Controller (FAC) guided the American air attack. At such close quarters, however, it was a harrowing experience for Kroon and his FAC. Later, his platoon was forced to take cover in an Afghan house, whence they repulsed repeated attacks during the night. No men fell under Kroon's command, but the resulting Taliban losses were severe. Leiderschap onder extreme omstandigheden, F.A. Ebbelaar, Carr√©, 2009, nr. 1, pp. 24‚Äì25 (Dutch) After the dawn, Kroon and his men emerged to retrieve intelligence from the dead Talibani to establish their identity. Kroon disciplined his men after noticing their agitation and inclination toward unprofessional behaviour (he later said that he understood the behaviour of his men but, as their leader, felt himself responsible for ensuring that the platoon acted professionally); he then ordered the wounded to be treated and the enemy dead to be covered. Kroon's superior officers later commended his leadership and ability to correct a battle-hardened group of commandoes. Ridder na strijd in vallei tegen Talibaan . Nrc.nl. Retrieved 24 October 2011. These actions and his general behaviour as a leader were the reason both his subordinates and his superiors nominated Kroon for bestowal of the Military Order.

Built in 1806 in Phippsburg, it is a high quality example of Federal period architecture. It was built by Thomas McCobb as a deliberately elaborate building, to exceed in quality the fine house in which he had grown up, and which he had lost in a family dispute. It was moved to its current location in 1925, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Description and history The Spite House stands on the east side of Deadman's Point, the easternmost projection of the peninsula which separates Rockport Harbor from Penobscot Bay. It is a large two-story wood frame structure, with a central hip-roofed main section flanked by wings extending to the north and south. The walls are finished in wooden clapboards, and the building rests on original granite slabs set on a 1925 concrete foundation. The roof is pierced by four tall brick chimneys, each with a band of corbelling near the top. The roof is encircled by a balustrade, and has an octagonal cupola at its center, also topped by a balustrade. The main facade is five bays wide, with simple corner trim rising to a plain entablature and modillioned cornice. Windows are sash with shutters, and there are decorative panels between the floors. The main entrance is framed by pilasters and topped by a half-round window and deep cornice supported by scrolled brackets. with James McCobb, an Irish immigrant, arrived in what is now Phippsburg in 1731, where living in a log cabin with his Irish-born wife, Beatrice, he raised a large family of 10 children, among whom was Thomas McCobb, who became a sea captain. In 1774, James built a handsome Federal period house for his second wife, Hannah Nichol, with whom he had three children, twin daughters, and a second son, also named Thomas. He married a third time in 1782, to Mary Langdon Storer Hill, who had a son, Mark Langdon Hill, from a previous marriage, who ended up marrying one of McCobb's daughters, one of the twins, who was a half-sister to Thomas. While Captain Thomas McCobb was away at sea, the Hills, which included Thomas' half-sister /wife of Mark Langdon Hill, and his second step-mother Mary Langdon Hill, broke James McCobb's will and claimed his house for their family. When Captain Thomas McCobb returned from his voyage and discovered what had happened, he resolved to build what became known as a spite house, deliberately near the old homestead and much more elaborate. This house was built in 1806. Ironically, Captain Thomas apparently never married and left no descendants, as a result, when he died the house was given over to the Hill family. In 1925, it was rescued from demolition by being moved to Rockport, at which time the extensive wings were added.

Through this project, manufacturers, represented by their national associations, wish to draw attention to the importance of their equipment which is vital in reaching Europe‚Äôs 2020 goals in terms of energy savings, development of renewable energy and a reduction in CO2 emissions. Compressors and vacuum pumps are used not only in projects for storage of CO2 but also in the manufacture of photovoltaic cells and in the transport and storage of hydrogen. These examples are part of the vast list of products and applications which professionals would like to make better known to the general public. This determination to develop and promote these technologies of the future is the consequence of the industry‚Äôs long-held commitment to reduce the environmental impact of the different production phases, to develop an ecologically sound approach to product design, and to encourage recycling of products. Sustainability projects and low carbon initiatives need compressed air, gas and vacuum equipment. This is formalized under a signature and a logo \\"Air Everywhere\\".

It consists of four separate episodes, each with its own cast and writers but sharing common themes of beautiful women, jealousy, revenge and death. From these dark tales centred on leading actresses, Oury switched to buddy comedies which remain among the most-loved and successful films in the history of French cinema. Louis de Fun√®s, here playing a barman whose English is incomprehensible, starred in them, as did English male leads like David Niven and Terry-Thomas. The writing team of Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac, behind the third episode, had provided the stories for two 1950s masterpieces, Les Diaboliques (1955) and Vertigo (1958). Le masque Le masque (\\"The Mask\\"), partly written by Jean Aurenche and Pierre Bost. In Venice in the 1490s, the ageing duchess Lucrezia suspects that her lover Angelo is seeing the younger and more beautiful Francesca. He is arrested by her brother, but escapes and is pursued by swordsmen who run him through. In revenge, Francesca smears poison inside the mask which the duchess places over her face to sleep. The episode ends with a shot of her palace at night and a terrible scream. *Edwige Feuill√®re as Dona Lucrezia, the duchess *Laura Efrikian as Antonella, her maid *Rina Morelli as Teresa, her companion *Gino Cervi as Chief of Police, her brother *Gabriele Ferzetti as Angelo Giraldi, her lover *Rosanna Schiaffino as Francesca Sabelli, his lover L'affaire Hugues L'affaire Hugues (\\"The Hugues Case\\"), partly written by Henri Jeanson and Ren√© Wheeler. In Paris in the 1880s, the combative socialist deputy Clovis Hugues has many enemies but is secure in the love of his beautiful wife Jeanne. As a way of getting at him, a plot by Madame Lenormand uses a venal journalist Morin and a young near-prostitute to blacken Jeanne's name. Humiliated by being called in for questioning, on emerging from the interview she sees Morin in the corridor. Taking a handgun from her bag, in front of several witnesses she shoots him dead. At her trial, all twelve of the jurymen vote her innocent. *Philippe Noiret as Clovis Hugues *Mich√®le Morgan as Jeanne, his wife *Lucienne Bogaert as Madame Lenormand, blackmailer *Claude Cerval as Morin, blackmailer L'affaire Fenayrou L'affaire Fenayrou (\\"The Fenayrou Case\\"), partly written by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac. In Paris in 1913, Gabrielle is told by her lover Louis that he is getting married for financial reasons but wants to carry on their affair as before. She starts giving her husband Martin a hard time, forcing him to live in the conservatory to avoid her wrath. Then she tells Louis that she has banished the man because of his drunken brutality and he must save her, for which she provides a revolver. When Louis tries to use the revolver on the husband one evening, he finds Gabrielle has emptied it. Martin promptly pulls out his own gun and kills Louis in what the police agree is self-defence. The handsome and unmarried Doctor Mathieu comes round to certify the death and ends up in Gabrielle's bed. He does not leave it, because he and Gabrielle celebrate with a bottle of champagne which Martin had poisoned. *Annie Girardot as Gabrielle Fenayrou *Pierre Brasseur as Martin Fenayrou, her husband *Christian Marquand as Louis Aubert, her lover *Paul Guers as Doctor Mathieu L'homme de l'avenue L'homme de l'avenue (\\"The Man on the Avenue\\"), partly written by Fr√©d√©ric Dard. On an avenue in Paris one evening in 1961, Philippe Marsais throws himself in front of a slow-moving car. The driver Roberts, an English army officer, reports the man's death at a police station and volunteers to break the news to his wife. She is not in, but he traces her to a bar where the attractive woman is on her own and far gone. He takes her home but, as she is incapable of serious talk, leaves her comfortable on the sofa. Outside, he sees a young woman drive off in the dead man's car and follows it. She goes to a hospital to ask if Philippe has been brought in. He tells her the man is dead in the morgue and asks her why she thought he was injured in hospital. It emerges that she is Philippe's lover and his plan was not to die but to be knocked down and taken to that hospital, which would gave him an alibi. While he was there, his wife would put the ice cubes he had poisoned into her whisky. Rushing to the wife's flat, Roberts finds both ice tray and the sofa empty. On storming into the bedroom, he finds her in bed with all the ice cubes in a bag on her aching head. *Raymond Loyer as Philippe Marsais *Danielle Darrieux as Lucienne Marsais, his wife *Perrette Pradier as H√©l√®ne, his lover *Richard Todd as Major William Roberts *Louis de Fun√®s as the barman External links * * * Category:1962 drama films Category:1962 films Category:Films directed by G√©rard Oury Category:French drama films Category:French films Category:French- language films Category:Italian films Category:Films scored by Georges Delerue Category:Films based on comic strips Category:Films based on French comics Category:Live-action films based on comics Category:French anthology films Category:Italian anthology films ","title":"Le Crime ne paie pas"},{"id":"21622874","text":"Albert B.

Built in 1846, it is a remarkably sophisticated treatment of Greek Revival architecture in rural setting. The building is home to the River of Life Church. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history The Somerset Academy building is located on the north side of Academy Street, a short way east of Brighton Road (Maine State Routes 150/151). The main building is a 2-1/2 story brick structure, with a front-facing gable roof, and there is a large modern addition to the rear. The front (south-facing) facade is three bays wide, articulated by brick piers, with sash windows on both levels in the outer bays. The center bay is finished in wooden clapboards, and has a simple entrance on the first floor, flanked by widely-set wooden pilasters and topped by an entablature and cornice. The second level has a sash window flanked by pilasters. An entablature encircles the building below the roof line. The front gable is finished in flushboard, with an eyebrow window at its center. Centered on the ridge, a two-stage square tower rises; the first stage is simple, finished in clapboards with cornerboards, while the second belfry stage has louvered round-arch openings and paneled corner pilasters. A simple balustrade tops the tower. The building was constructed in 1846 by Joseph Bigelow, a regionally well-known builder of the period from Skowhegan. Money for its construction was raised by subscription, the largest donation coming from John Ware, who also gave the land. The building now hosts the River of Life Church and a local chapter of the American Legion.

During the 1920s, he owned the Oorang Dog Kennels.Ohio History Central: \\"Walter Lingo\\", July 1, 2005.ATCA Hunting/Working Committee: \\"An Appreciation of The Airedale Terrier\\", March 25, 2000.Nancy L. Secrist: \\"Origins of the Airedale Terrier: A Dog Bred To Be The Jack of All Trades\\", n.d. (2011). As a way of promoting his kennels, Lingo financed a National Football League franchise, called the Oorang Indians in 1922.Sam Borowski: \\"Oorang Indians: One of the First NFL Teams\\", Ethnic NewsWatch Indian Country Today (Lakota Times), January 5, 1995. Dog breeder Lingo bred his first litter when he was 9 years old in 1900. Over time he bred and sought to create a stronger type of Airedale. His efforts resulted in the King Oorang breed of Airedale dogs. Lingo described the King Oorang as the \\"world's great all-around dog.\\" Upon creating the King Oorang breed, Lingo embarked on a mail order business, selling his puppies to people throughout the Americas. Lingo spent most of his time breeding and training his championship Oorang Airedale dogs in LaRue. He expanded his breeding program to meet the enormous demand for Airedales by selling up to a thousand Airedale bitches to farmers throughout Ohio. Lingo took back the bitches for breeding and whelping, then returned them to their owners, while buying back the pups at a pre-agreed price. Lingo then resold the pups to buyers throughout the country. Reportedly Walter sold up to 15,000 Airedales per year, and by the mid-1920s he claimed to be spending $2,000 per month on advertising. Over time, the Oorang Kennel Company and its Oorang Airedales became known throughout the world. He donated a stud dog for Red Cross work in Europe to the military during World War I, then, after the war, promoted in advertising for the purpose of breeding. He also gave away dogs as a promotion to winners of contests, silent film stars, baseball players, and two were given to the editor of Field & Stream magazine, who favored the kennel with complimentary ads and even a fictional book or two, featuring Oorang Airedales. However many of Lingo's neighbors described the Airedales as killers. These neighboring farmers accused the Oorang Kennels of raising a nation of sheep killers. This public relations disaster, prompted Lingo to enlist the aid of celebrities to endorse his dogs. He invited celebrities, such as Ty Cobb of the Detroit Tigers, boxer Jack Dempsey, actor Gary Cooper, Tris Speaker of the Cleveland Indians, and Olympic sprinter Charles Paddock to LaRue to hunt with him and his dogs. Perhaps, Lingo's most famous supporter was Jim Thorpe, the celebrated athlete of the 1920s. With no reluctance at all, Thorpe came to Lingo's aid by testifying that he once knew an Oorang Airedale that had saved a 6-year-old girl's life. After that, Lingo and Thorpe became hunting buddies. Oorang Indians To help promote his dogs, Lingo eventually created the Oorang Indians, an NFL team in La Rue. He established the squad as a publicity stunt and named the team after his Oorang dog kennels. The cost of establishing an NFL franchise in 1922 was $100, however the cost of just one of Lingo's Airedales could sell for $150. The stunt worked and Lingo would go on to make a million dollars selling Airedales in just one year, during the height of popularity of the Oorang Indians. La Rue is the smallest community to have ever sponsored an NFL franchise. The Indians, however, never played a game in La Rue. the team was primarily a traveling team. What \\"home games\\" they did play were played in Marion since La Rue lacked a playing field. Lingo hired Thorpe to put together a team that only consisted of Native American players. He was paid $500 a week to organize the team. The Indians remained a team in the National Football League for the 1922 and the 1923 seasons. The Oorang Indians players didn't only play football. Lingo also required them to work in his kennels, caring for his dogs. He also forced his players to parade around the football field with his dogs during half times, hoping that fans would purchase his dogs. Lingo used his own Airedale terrier magazine, Oorang Comments, to get dog and football enthusiasts buzzing about his product and his team. At first the Oorang Indians were an excellent gate attraction. However, the novelty eventually wore off and Lingo pulled his financial backing. So, at the end of the 1923 NFL season, the Indians suspended operations. First halftime shows Many football historians credit Lingo with creating the halftime show. He would lure audiences to his games with the promise of an outrageous halftime show, instead of the promise of a good football game. Entertainment, both prior to the games and during halftimes, was provided by the players and the Airedale dogs. There were shooting exhibitions with the dogs retrieving the targets. There were Indian dances and tomahawk and knife-throwing demonstrations. One halftime event showcased an Indians player, named Long Time Sleep, wrestling a live bear. Another show was a demonstration of the United States Indian scouts actions during World War I. The show promoted Lingo's kennels by showing the Airedale Red Cross dogs administering first aid to a wounded soldier. Many of the scouts and Red Cross dogs taking part in the event were real veterans of the war, while the German troops were impersonated by local American Legion men who wore German uniforms furnished by Lingo. The halftime activities soon became more important than the results of the game for the Indians fanbase. The Indians only won 3 games in their two seasons of existence. Great Depression After the Oorang Indians' collapse, Lingo continued to sell his Airedale dogs. Unfortunately, the Great Depression struck in the 1930s, prompting Lingo to scale back his business. People could no longer afford the Airedales, prompting Lingo to have approximately three hundred puppies euthanized in 1929 alone. He eventually tried to establish a business in Minneapolis, Minnesota that manufactured dog biscuits, but this venture failed to succeed. However back in LaRue, Lingo's wife, Beryl, revived the kennels. Although the operation was scaled down from its 1920's peak, the Oorang Kennel Company continued until Walter Lingo‚Äôs death in 1966.

It was first performed at the Royal Opera, Stockholm on 21 February 1919.Haglund R. Wilhelm Peterson-Berger. In: New Grove Dictionary of Opera. Macmillan, London and New York, 1997.  Background  Based on a story which the composer found in the journal Den svenska Mercurius (1759), the opera features several historical characters (Bure, Skytte, Queen Kristina), and is set in the university city of Uppsala just before the end of the Thirty Years‚Äô War in which Sweden became a major European power. The war increased people's worries about the end of the world and two academics claim to have calculated when Doomsday will take place. The opera's composition was completed during the First World War. The first performance was conducted by Armas J√§rnefelt. From notes by Stig Jakobson to the Sterling CD of excerpts from a 1984 Swedish Radio performance conducted by Ulf S√∂derblom (CDS 1069-2).

Due to a wager between the university don Johan Bure and Queen Kristina's apothecary Simon Wolimhaus, as to when the world will end (which the professor seems to be fated to lose), the innkeeper, Klas Mugg, and his daughter, Elin, look set to lose their home. Elin is in love with the studious but poor Lars, who is bullied by the ‚Äònobler‚Äô students. (Lars's aunt is also trying to match him with her own daughter.) Lars gets arrested for threatening his tormentors with Johan Papegoja's pistol and is arraigned in front of a university tribunal, which could result in him being expelled. *Act 2 Outside Uppsala cathedral. With Lars afraid for his future and marriage to Elin, army captain Lennart Sporre convinces Klas to let Elin marry Lars, in return for upsetting the wager, which he does by setting fire to Wolimhaus‚Äô dog kennel (this invalidates the terms of the wager as the fire devalues the latter's effects) under cover of a thunderstorm. He argues with the university officials that passing judgment on Lars when the end of the world is nigh is pointless. They ignore this and proceed to condemn Lars, but when the fire is discovered, he escapes during the tumult. *Act 3 On Uppsala Castle Hill. Lars is now in despair, wondering whether he should enlist in the army or emigrate. Sporre and the noble students sing a serenade to G√∂rvel and city musicians assemble in the castle tower to welcome the queen. Sporre explains that the wager is no longer valid as the value of the properties has changed because of the fire (as he planned). As the brass blare out, Wolimhaus believes the Doomsday has arrived, but it is the Queen's arrival and acclaim from the crowd. Lars is pardoned, is able to marry Elin and Sporre gets his beloved G√∂rvel. The two prophets are left confounded.From notes to the Sterling CD of excerpts from 1984 Swedish Radio performance conducted by Ulf S√∂derblom.

(Untersuchung und Schlichtungs-Ausschuss, roughly translated as the Committee for Investigation and SettlementAlternate translations include Tribunal of Inquiry and Arbitration, Bramsted p 108; \\"Settlement\\" in this context is sometimes translated as \\"Arbitration\\" or \\"Mediation\\" or \\"Conciliation.\\") was an internal Nazi tribunalWhile sometimes called a \\"court,\\" the Uschla was more in the nature of an arbitration or mediation board, since its true function was not to determine which party had the correct legal view or position in a dispute (as does a court of law), but rather to resolve disputes promptly and effectively, so that internecine battles would not adversely affect the public's (or the general party membership's) perception of the NSDAP. See generally William L. Shirer, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich (Simon & Schuster, 1960), p. 122 (\\"Shirer\\"). system that was established by Adolf Hitler in 1926 to settle intra-party problems and disputes. Organization The Uschla eventually evolved into a four-level system, organized on geographic lines. The highest level, the Reichs-Uschla, presided in Munich, where the NSDAP (the Nazi Party) itself had begun. Immediately below this level was the Gau-Uschla, with one such tribunal for each Gau.The territory comprising the Third Reich consisted of approximately 35 Gau, or geographic divisions for administrative purposes. Following the general geographic organization of the Gau system, below this Gau-level was the Kreis-Uschla, which in turn linked to the lowest level of tribunal, the Ort-Uschla. At the zenith of the system's development, a typical Gau might contain approximately 100 Ort-Uschlas. Grant, p. 57-8. The initial chairman of the Uschla was a former Reichswehr Lieutenant General Heinemann, who failed to grasp the real purpose of the tribunal: namely, to settle disputes so as to keep them quiet, rather than to achieve substantive justice between the disputants or to enforce a moral code.CiteReference Accordingly, he was soon replaced in 1927 by the politically more astute Major Walter Buch (also a former Reichswehr officer), who was in turn aided by two close and highly trusted Hitler cohorts, Ulrich Graf and Hans Frank.Shirer, op. cit.. Buch remained as the chair of the Uschla until the end of World War II.Grant p. 57. Conflicts between the Sturmabteilung (SA) and the Uschla system were perhaps inevitable, reflecting in part the typical conflict between political and military functions in less pathological institutions. The SA leadership sought maximum autonomy within the Nazi system, and resented any infringement upon its free- wheeling style, especially if based (even theoretically) upon some principles of law.Grant p. 58. The natural antagonism between the two loci of power peaked when the Uschla attempted to subject SA men to its jurisdiction.Grant p. 58. A particular case in January 1930 defined the jurisdictional issue between the rivals. After a hearing before an Ort-Uschla in Saxony, expulsion was ordered for an SA man, but his SA commander disagreed with the decision and claimed that the tribunal had no jurisdiction over SA men performing their functions in the line of duty. A rather feeble SA attempt at compromise in May 1930 stipulated that the Uschla lacked jurisdiction over \\"SA affairs\\" and could only intervene in those affairs if (a) the SA man's conduct did serious harm to the interests of the NSDAP and (b) his commanding officer agreed that serious harm had been done. While this bit of Nazi lawyering appeared to make Uschla jurisdiction, in effect, entirely contingent upon the consent of the SA commander,The SA commander could simply claim that no \\"serious harm\\" to party interests had resulted, thereby entirely avoiding any Uschla jurisdiction it left the undefined term \\"SA affairs\\" open to interpretation and argument, so little progress in settling the jurisdictional squabble resulted. Upon assuming control of the SA in January 1931, Ernst R√∂hm attempted a conciliation with Buch over SA-Uschla affairs.Grant, p.xx However, these conciliatory attempts crashed upon the rock of the Stennes Revolt.Grant.

It is the story of three youths who attempt to avenge their rights in a society of criminals and thugs. Synopsis Shin (Jo Odagiri), a Japanese university student, finds a book with a section about the hazards to be found in New York City. Otherwise leading a boring life, he eagerly heads to New York but soon finds out the hazards are true when he is mugged. Two Japanese-American punks, an outgoing thief named Lee (Jai West) and his shy sidekick Takeda (Motoki Fukami), help him out after the mugging, and together the three begin a life of excitement and danger. In the end, that gets them in trouble with the police, resulting in a death. Shin ultimately goes back to Japan with a new thirst for life. Cast * Jo Odagiri as Shin * Jai West as Lee * Motoki Fukami as Takeda * Hiroyuki Ikeuchi as Won * Rin Kurana * Sayako Hagiwara * Clark Saturn Reception Critical reception for the film was mixed to positive. Twitch Film praised the film, writing that director Sono's \\"grunge fantasy of New York is built up from impressions of the city through early Scorsese pictures makes no bones of its wish-fulfillment intent.\\" They made note of the film being shot \\"with long hand-held takes and an improvised feel of perpetual motion,\\" and making use of non-actors in supporting roles to give the film a sense of v√©rit√© style \\"cleverly subverted to full blown fantasy.\\" Asia Pacific Arts called Hazard a \\"gritty, bilingual (even bipolar) film\\". Film Threat also praised the film, writing that even with director Sono not liking the film and with his feeling it was the least of his works, the reviewer felt the film was a \\"brilliant\\" and \\"extremely well made romp through the criminal NYC underworld.\\" However, Japan Times overall panned the film, saying that the movie \\"trades on tired cliches of American (or rather pre-Guiliani New York) criminality and racism, while betraying attitudes close to those it is ostensibly condemning\\". Release The film was shot guerilla style in New York City in 2002, but did not have theatrical release in Japan until 2006. The film debuted at the Sapporo Film Festival on November 5, 2005, and had theatrical release in Japan on November 11, 2006, and in South Korea on April 19, 2007.

Its site is located at the Turkish village of ≈û√ºkranje. From the middle of the 2nd century CE to the middle of the 6th century CE, Tymion was an important town for the ancient Christian church of Montanism. The Montanists, whose church spread all over the Roman Empire, expected the New Jerusalem to descend to earth at Tymion and the nearby town of Pepuza; Pepuza was the headquarters of Montanism and the seat of the Montanist patriarch. One of the founders of Montanism, Montanus, called both towns \\"Jerusalem.\\" In late antiquity, both places attracted crowds of pilgrims from all over the Roman Empire. Women played an emancipated role in Montanism. They could become priests and also bishops. In the 6th century CE, this church became extinct. Since 2001, Peter Lampe of the University of Heidelberg has directed annual archaeological campaigns in Phrygia, Turkey. During these interdisciplinary campaigns, together with William Tabbernee of Tulsa, numerous unknown ancient settlements were discovered and archaeologically documented. Two of them are the best candidates so far in the search for the identification of the two holy centers of ancient Montanism, Pepuza and Tymion. Scholars had searched for these lost sites since the 19th century. The archaeological site at ≈û√ºkranje (Karahallƒ± area) that Peter Lampe identified as Tymion was already settled in late Bronze and early Iron Ages. It flourished in Roman and Byzantine times as a rural town where predominantly tenant farmers lived. They worked on an imperial estate and were often oppressed by travelling magistrates or imperial slaves. In a petition, the farmers asked for help from the emperor. The emperor Septimius Severus wrote back that his procurator would support the farmers. The imperial rescript is preserved on an inscription.

It is situated about 50 km north of the village of Palapye. Toutswemogala is an elongated flat-topped hill rising about 50 meters above the surrounding flat mopane veld. It is an Iron Age settlement, which has been occupied on two occasions. The radio-carbon dates for this settlement range from 7th to late 19th century AD indicating occupation of more than one thousand years. The hill was part of the formation of early states in Southern Africa with cattle keeping as major source of economy. This was supplemented by goats, sheep and foraging as well as hunting of wild animals. The remaining features of Toutswe settlement include house-floors, large heaps of vitrified cow-dung and burials while the outstanding structure is the stone wall. There are large traits of centaurs ciliaris, a type of grass which has come to be associated with cattle-keeping settlements in South, Central Africa.Toutswemogala Hill Iron Age Settlement - UNESCO World Heritage Centre  History  Around 700 A.D., the Toutswe people moved westward into Botswana and began an agricultural and pastoral land tenure system based on sorghum and millet, and domesticated stock, respectively.Hall, Martin (1990), Farmers, Kings, and Traders: The People of Southern Africa, 200-1860, University of Chicago Press. . The site was situated in the center of a broader cultural area in Eastern Botswana and shares many commonalities with other archaeological sites of this region, in both ceramic production styles and also timeframes inhabited. Large structures were observed that contained vitrified remains of animal dung, leading to the theory that these were animal enclosures and that Toutswemogala Hill was thus a major center of animal husbandry in the region. However, agriculture also played a vital role in the longevity of Toutswemogala Hill's extended occupation, as many grain storage structures have also been found on the site. Many different stratified layers of housing floors further signal continuous occupation over hundreds of years.[3]There are also some iron tools and gold goods which suggests that people in Toutswemogala used to mine iron and gold which they to make their life more simple  World Heritage Status  This site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on July 21, 1999 in the Cultural category.

These claims produced a stream of national and international media outlets into local Provincetown, Massachusetts.

It is located on Jacksonville's Westside on the former Naval Air Station Cecil Field, and includes Cecil Airport. The 17 thousand- acre center represents more than three percent of the land area in Duval County, most of it zoned for development. The property was conveyed to the City of Jacksonville and converted to its current use between 1999 and 2002. History In July 1993, former Naval Air Station Cecil Field in Jacksonville, Florida was recommended for closure by the Base Realignment and Closure Commission. In response to the decision to close NAS Cecil Field, the Mayor of Jacksonville established the Cecil Field Development Commission, succeeded by the Jacksonville Economic Development Commission (JEDC), and later the Office of Economic Development (OED). One of the major responsibilities of the commission was to develop a proposed base reuse plan that would guide the transition of NAS Cecil Field from a fully operational Navy base to civilian use. In 1996, the NAS Cecil Field Final Base Reuse Plan was approved and in March 1999, the Jacksonville City Council approved the Cecil Commerce Center Operations and Business Plan. The plan projected that businesses at the CCC would have 5,600 employees by 2009 and 25,000 by 2019. Between July 1999 and April 2002, property was conveyed to the JEDC (now the OED), Jacksonville Aviation Authority (JAA), the City of Jacksonville Parks Department and Clay County. Existing recreational facilities within the area were included with surrounding acreage to create the Cecil Recreation Complex, which was expanded to create the Jacksonville Equestrian Center, Cecil Aquatic Center, and other new recreation opportunities. Since the time of the conveyance of approximately , the OED has worked to promote the site as a prime location for companies in the manufacturing, industrial-related and distribution industries, as well as other uses including support retail and office space along the main roads. The Jacksonville Aviation Authority controls the land surrounding the airport and south of Normandy Boulevard. Several aviation companies have leased all the former Navy hangars at the airport. Most of this area was developed by the Navy before the base was closed. Land to the north of Normandy Boulevard is controlled by the city of Jacksonville, and is mostly wetlands. Many sites require four feet of fill, establishing drainage and building a road to the parcel from New World Avenue, the main thoroughfare connecting Normandy with Cecil Commerce Center Parkway. There is also no railroad service at CCC, so if a business needed it, the city would need to pay for a spur that crosses Interstate 10. The biggest development goal was to attract a mega-project, such as an aircraft or vehicle assembly plant which would employ thousands. Those projects usually depend on incentives, and competition among the states of North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama and Florida is intense. CCC has competed for several big deals, including an aircraft manufacturing plant for Boeing, a complex for Spirit AeroSystems, and a van assembly plant for DaimlerChrysler. The Cecil Commerce Center Parkway and I-10 interchange was completed in October, 2009. The $62 million project provided direct access to Cecil Commerce Center and was the first section of the new, regional First Coast Expressway. In 2009, the actual number of people employed at CCC in 2009 was approximately 2,000, just one third of the projected number. On June 8, 2010, the city signed a contract with Hillwood as Master Developer for CCC to expedite development, provide expertise, strategy and private capital for the long term project. Current developments * As master developer of approximately 4,475 acres of City- owned property at Cecil Commerce Center, Hillwood branded the site with their premiere brand name ‚Äì AllianceFlorida at Cecil Commerce Center. Hillwood agreed to invest more than $1.3 billion to develop the entire 31-million- square-foot master plan. These developments will attract the companies that will bring thousands of new jobs and expand the tax base. * FlightStar, a heavy aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul contractor, is constructing a $27 million, 30,000 sq. ft. hangar expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2014. They will hire an additional 400 people, bringing their total employment at Cecil Commerce Center to more than 800. * Florida State College at Jacksonville completed construction of a state of the art truck driving facility at their North Cecil Campus. * Boeing moved its F-18 repair operations to Cecil Commerce Center, creating 60 jobs in Jacksonville.

They use the gallery as a hiding place, to separate themselves from a world which has shattered them. He, by his time as a world traveling photojournalist, and she, by horribly failed relationships. Thomas brings Katharine coffee each morning, and tells her stories of its particular origin, although these stories are actually reflections of his own experiences. These lead to flashbacks of iconic moments that have led to their present state, as well as their relationship to the art that hangs in the gallery, which Katharine will not easily sell. In the end, we journey through a love story which shows Katharine and Thomas, that just like the Impressionist art on the walls, the more they step away from the canvas of their lives up to now, the more they realize that their future together might hold more depth than the past that has led them to each other.

As producer Bill Haber said, \\"We did not give Jack O'Brien and our extraordinary creative team and company enough time to fully prepare Michael Jacobs's new play for Broadway. Impressionism is a world premiere on Broadway, which has not been work-shopped or played out of town. We are working hard in previews and we need more time to get the show finished for the official opening.\\" The team took the time to sculpt the play back to what the original script had called for, and the intermission, which was added in rehearsal, was eliminated. The play met with mixed reviews by the critics. Ben Brantley of The New York Times was negative, calling it \\"undernourished\\" and its stars \\"ill-used\\". Entertainment Weekly, however, gave the play a B and wrote that, \\"[Impressionism] practices the art of romantic comedy with a nice mix of pathos, intellect, and wit\\". The New Yorker was enthusiastic and thought the play \\"is as awkward as it is sublime\\", noting its \\"brazen sweetness\\" and \\"openhearted humor\\".

These books are all illustrated by David Wyatt. Setting The Larklight trilogy is set in an alternative Victorian-era universe, where mankind has been exploring the solar system for at least a century. Earth is the same as it was in the late 19th century, but only the United Kingdom and its Empire possess the engines to travel across the solar system. The United States, which the British consider to be rebellious colonies, and France, though not technically at war with Britain on Earth, are in a struggle to sabotage the Britons' expansive interests and develop space technology of their own. London, the centre of the universe, has many spaceports and is the base of many organisations such as the Royal Xenological Society.  Larklight  Larklight is the first book in the series. The story begins in the Larklight manor where they have a visitor. However, soon, white spiders from Saturn invade Larklight and they have to save the known universe from a madman.  Starcross  Starcross, the second book in the trilogy begins when Art Mumby and his prim older sister Myrtle, at their home (Larklight) with their mother and father, receive a strange invitation to the Starcross hotel, located in the asteroid field.  Mothstorm  Mothstorm, the third book and the last book in the trilogy, was published in hardback in October 2008. The paperback was scheduled to be published on 6 July 2009. They fight giant moths, and a race of blue lizards led by a Rogue Shaper. Film adaptations Warner Bros. had planned a $200 million adaptation of the first book Larklight, with Shekhar Kapur directing. The movie would have been released in 2010. It is unknown if the rest of the trilogy will be adapted. However Shekhar Kapur said Larklight will be the last expensive movie he will make, so it is unlikely that Starcross and Mothstorm will be adapted unless another director chooses to do so. The film was planned to be released January 1, 2010, but after the death of director Anthony Minghella, Shekhar Kapur took over his unfinished movie, New York, I Love You, and Larklight had to be postponed.

It is the most powerful gamma-ray burst ever recorded. The explosion had the energy of approximately 5900 type Ia supernovae, and the gas jets emitting the initial gamma rays moved at a minimum velocity of approximately 299,792,158 m/s (0.999999c), making this blast the most extreme recorded to date.Most Extreme Gamma-ray Blast Ever, Seen By Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, Science Daily, February 19, 2009Huge gamma-ray blast spotted 12.2 bln light-years from earth, AFP, February 19, 2009 The 16.5-second delay for the highest-energy gamma ray observed in this burst is consistent with some theories of quantum gravity, which state that all forms of light may not travel through space at the same speed. Very-high-energy gamma rays may be slowed down as they propagate through the quantum turbulence of space- time.Most Powerful Gamma-Ray Burst May Point to New Physics, Sky and Telescope, February 19, 2009New telescope finds strange behavior in gamma-ray bursts, and also documents the most energetic burst known, Science News, February 20, 2009 The explosion took place 12.2 billion light-years (light travel distance) away. That means it occurred 12.2 billion years ago‚Äîwhen the universe was only about 1.5 billion years old. The burst lasted for 23 minutes, almost 700 times as long as the two-second average for high energy GRBs. Follow-up observations were made 32 hours after the blast using the Gamma-Ray Burst Optical/Near-Infrared Detector (GROND) on the 2.2 metre telescope at the European Southern Observatory in La Silla, Chile, allowing astronomers to pinpoint the blast's distance to 12.2 billion light years.Fermi‚Äôs record breaking gamma-ray burst, Astronomy Now, February 20, 2009 If all that energy from GRB 080916C could be captured and converted into usable electricity at 100% efficiency, it would produce enough electricity to supply the entire planet Earth with 13.5 octillion years of power (according to electricity consumption of 2008).

The now ruined complex dates back to the Pre-Angkorian Chenla Kingdom (late 6th to 9th century), established by king Isanavarman I as central royal sanctuary and capital, known then as Isanapura ( - Isan borak).Higham, C., 2014, Early Mainland Southeast Asia, Bangkok: River Books Co., Ltd., In 2017, Sambor Prei Kuk was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Located on the Eastern bank of the Tonle Sap lake, close to the Steung Saen River, the central part of Sambor Prei Kuk is divided into three main groups. Each group has a square layout surrounded by a brick wall. The structures of the overall archaeological area were constructed at variable times: the southern and north groups (7th century) by Isanavarman I, who is considered a possible founder of the city and the central group (later date). The buildings of Sambor Prei Kuk are characteristic of the Pre-Angkorean period with a simple external plan. The principal material is brick, but sandstone is also used for certain structures.Groupe de Sambor Prei Kuk - UNESCO World Heritage Centre Architectural features include numerous prasats, octagonal towers, shiva lingams and yonis, ponds and reservoirs, and lion sculptures. Sambor Prei Kuk is located amidst mature sub-tropical forests with limited undergrowth.

Official religion  The official religion at Sambor Prei Kuk city was Shaivism, one of the four most widely followed sects of Hinduism, which reveres the god Shiva as the Supreme Being and the Lingam (in Sanskrit ‡§≤‡§ø‡§ô‡•ç‡§ó‡§Ç, li·πÖga·πÉ, meaning \\"mark\\", \\"sign\\", or \\"inference\\") or Shiva linga representing Shiva to be worshiped in temples.Hinduism: Beliefs and Practices, by Jeanne Fowler, pgs. 42‚Äì43 In Cambodia as it is in India, the lingam is a symbol of the energy and potential of god Shiva himselfMudaliyar, Sabaratna. \\"Lecture on the Shiva Linga\\".

Campbell, Joseph, ed. Myths and symbols in Indian art and civilization. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press. p. 126. . But the basic and most common object of worship in Shiva shrines is the phallus or lingam. Shaivism was the religion of Chenla (ca. 550 - ca. 800 AD), including elements of Hinduism, Buddhism and indigenous ancestor cults.Chandler, A History of Cambodia, pp.19-20. In the Sambor Prei Kuk temples, it is possible to contemplate stone inscriptions in both Sanskrit and Khmer, naming both Hindu and local ancestral deities with Shiva and several altars with the lingam.

This copy has annotations identifying the railroads and the town of Sunset, Colorado (at right center). Sunset, Colorado townsite. This house appeared to be the only occupied dwelling in 2010. Switzerland Trail above Sunset townsite. Note the well-preserved rockwork on the old railroad embankment. 2010 photo by Don O'Brien. The Switzerland Trail is the site of a historic narrow gauge railroad line that was operated at different times by the Greeley, Salt Lake and Pacific Railway, the Colorado and Northwestern Railroad, and the Denver, Boulder, and Western Railroad around the turn of the 20th century in the Colorado front range mining area near Nederland, Gold Hill, and Ward. The west end of the trail is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the \\"Denver, Boulder and Western Railway Historic District\\". Description The earliest segment of the trail dates to 1883, with continual track growth until 1894 by the GSL&P;, when a large flood destroyed many tracks and bankrupted the company. In 1896 the line was reopened as the C&N; took over, completing many spur lines and the southern branch of the Switzerland Trail. The C&N; is responsible for the name \\"Switzerland Trail\\", given in 1898 in a successful attempt to attract the tourist trade. By the end of the 1800s, the C&N; had folded and the DB&W; took over. In 1919 the line was shut down and the tracks were subsequently pulled up, but the roadbed remains. A large portion of the roadbed is \\"maintained\\" (benignly neglected) as a hiking/biking trail as part of the Boulder County road system. It was, and remains, well known for its beautiful scenic views of the Front Range hills. The remaining mountain route, about long, winds between altitudes of 7,000 and over 9,000 feet, from the townsite of Eldora, Colorado, past Nederland, on north through Sugar Loaf and, ultimately, Ward. The line winds past several local historically prominent mines, including the Blue Bird Mine and a few miles from the Caribou Mine in the then-bustling (now ghost-) town of Caribou. The main line originated in Boulder, Colorado, coming up Fourmile Canyon through the mining communities of Salina, Colorado and Crisman, Colorado. It was connected via a three-rail track shared with railroads to Denver, Colorado. In its heyday, near the turn of the twentieth century, the Switzerland Trail was the major source of bulk transportation in the area, carrying supplies and tourists to mining camps and towns in the front range, ore from the myriad mines to a few centralized mills, and refined metal down to Boulder for transport to the rest of the nation. A federal ore assay office, built at the turn of the 20th century, was located near the now- sleepy community of Wall Street, Colorado, at the intersection of the Switzerland Trail route with Fourmile Canyon. At the time Sunset was a bustling community, driven by the presence of an ore mill and the railroad. The building remains and is now something of a curiosity: the James F. Bailey Assay Office Museum, located in Wallstreet, Colorado, now a somewhat remote grouping of houses at least 20 minutes by car from the nearest town (Boulder). The C&N; and the DB&W; railroads were more canny than the GSL&P;, and did a brisk business transporting tourists from Boulder and Denver up into the mountains. Several dedicated park sites and hotels (including the Mont Alto park site, its location now marked by a sign) were built or encouraged by the railroad to draw day-trippers. The demise of the line came from a variety of factors, including: the extremely harsh winter conditions in the Rocky Mountains, which limited the tourist trade to about four months per year, forced frequent line closures, and periodically killed train crews; the invention and rise of the automobile; mine closures in Ward and Eldora; and failure of several ventures including a long tunnel/adit mine that was to be dug from Sunset into rich underground gold seams to the northwest. The Switzerland Trail remains a well known hiking, OHV, motorcycle, 4x4, and biking trailhttp://www.traillink.com/trail/switzerland-trail.aspx because the smooth grade and 2%-5% slope of the railway make an easy traverse, while the narrowness of the railbed (typically wide) brings users close to the spectacular terrain.

The upper area is heavily wooded and has an adventure playground. The entrance on Crookes Valley Road has pillars made from carved telegraph poles. The Ponderosa is a recreation area within the City of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England. Although not a public park it was designated as Open Space by Sheffield City Council in the 1993 Unitary Development Plan. It covers an area of over 10 hectares (25 acres) and is located at , 1.5 km west of the city centre between the districts of Upperthorpe and Netherthorpe. Although the name ‚ÄúPonderosa‚Äù was originally an informal name given by local children, it is now the accepted title and is recognised by the local council. Along with Weston Park and Crookes Valley Park it is one of the three ‚ÄúCrookesmoor Parks‚Äù. History The Ponderosa can be split into two distinct halves, each with contrasting history. The upper part was for many years known as Crookesmoor Recreation Ground, however prior to that it was an area of small dams in open countryside. The dams were built around 1740 by Joshua Matthewman after he had gained permission from the Lord of the Manor, Edward Howard, 9th Duke of Norfolk. The dams were constructed to impound local spring water to supply the town of Sheffield. J. Tayler's map of Sheffield of 1832 shows a string of four small dams below (north) of what is now Crookes Valley Road and on the site of the present day upper Ponderosa. These four dams were filled in during the second half of the 19th century and by 1903 it was shown on the map as Crookesmoor Recreation Ground. During World War II the recreation ground was used as a station for barrage balloons to defend the city.\\"A History of Sheffield\\", David Hay, Page 125 Gives details of J. Tayler‚Äòs map.\\"Sheffield: Its Story and its Achievements\\", Mary Walton, Page 99 Gives information on dams. In the first half of the 19th century the lower part of The Ponderosa was open countryside just to the south west of the Sheffield General Infirmary which at that time stood in a rural location to the west of the town. During the second half of the 1800s an area of back-to-back houses known as the Port Mahon estate was constructed on the site. This housing stood until the 1960s when it was demolished as part of a programme of urban development in the Upperthorpe and Netherthorpe areas. Certain thoroughfares such as Wentworth Street,Watery Lane, Hammond Street disappeared and Burlington Street partially disappeared altogether and the housing between Martin Street and Wentworth Street was replaced by tower blocks and maisonettes leaving a central area for recreation. This recreation area was christened ‚ÄúThe Ponderosa‚Äù by local children after the name of the ranch in the TV series Bonanza which was popular throughout the 1960s.\\"Old Ordnance Survey Maps: Sheffield (West)\\" Gives some history of upper and lower Ponderosa. Present day In the 1960s the area was a bare open bowl but much appreciated and used by the local community for games and community events. Since then there has been much development. The upper part of the Ponderosa is clothed in woodland, scrub, meadow and rough grassland which gives a fine environment for wildlife. Foxes and kestrels are often seen, and there is a wealth of bird and butterfly species. The upper part also contains an adventure playground and a mini football pitch. In 1999 the Crookes Valley Road entrance was given new gateway pillars, with each pillar consisting of three carved telegraph poles.Sheffield Hallam University Public Art Archive. Gives details of Crookes Valley Road entrance. The lower part of the Ponderosa stands in the shadow of seven tower blocks on its western side and St Stephen's church on Fawcett Street on its eastern. This lower area has a children's playground and several wooded copses.\\"Information board at park\\" Gives details of present day park. In 1990 The Ponderosa Environmental Group (PEG) was formed and planted a community orchard consisting of apple and plum trees. Since then more fruit trees and spring bulbs have been added as well as four acres of native woodland. The group is committed to improving the open space and played a major part in the campaign to prevent housing development on the Ponderosa in 1993.www.england- in-particular.info.

He was a well known manufacturer of roller skates and bicycles sometimes known as \\"The Roller Skate King.\\" The Henley Roller Skate Works could turn out 2,000 pairs of roller skates in one day. He was granted at least two (2 of several held by Henley & Company) U.S. Patents for improvements to the Roller Skate in 1880 and 1881. Henley's Roller Skates were perhaps the best selling Roller Skates of the late 1890s.** His original goal was to increase sales at his parent's lumber and millwork yard. Plimpton's 1863 patent on skates with 4 wheels was expiring, and Henley, ever the promoter, picked up his father's challenge to \\"sell more wood\\". The first skates were all wood, had wooden wheels, and canvas straps. By 1878, Henley had his initial operation running in his father's stable at 309 N 14th Street. His 5 sisters were taught to run his lathe, and were kept busy making wheels. Henley was fascinated with speed, and supported teams of bicycle racers, and also owned race horses. He conceived the idea of wooden floors in every town where local teams could compete in roller skate racing, and several of his patents were aimed at improving cornering. He built his first roller skate rink between North 7th and 8th streets on Saylor Street in Richmond, Indiana, and named it \\"The Coliseum\\". After it burned to the ground, it became first a parking lot, and now a small water park. When cleaning trash under spectator benches became a nuisance, he patented the \\"Coliseum Chair\\" with a seat that lifts up to make cleaning the floor easier in 1904.US Patent 755133 He published a book of rules for roller skate Polo, as well as 16 rules for skating with your sweetheart. With a high quality product and great promotions, the space in the stable was extended 5 times. In 1880 he purchased the house at 201 N 14th Street, and doubled his shop space by including the carriage house there. His nephew suggested using ball bearings in the wheels which they patented in 1884. Product demand went wild; so he built a large two story factory on N 16th Street, which occupied most of a city block, and the Henley Bicycle Works was born. All three buildings are still standing in 2017. Under the leadership of Henley, the workers at Henley Bicycle Works manufactured bicycles; roller skates; scooters; lawn furniture and lawn swings; iron working machinery; tools; boring, milling and screw driving machines used in wood manufacturing; gas meters; fence machines and lawn mowers. The company also provided nickel plating services. Henley lived at 201 N. 14th Street in Richmond. The Wright Brothers lived at 211 N. 14th Street, two houses away, for a time. Henley sold Wilbur his first bicycle for $10, which Wilbur borrowed from his brother Orville, and repaid 50 cents per week. Thus the Wright brothers migrated from an interest in kites (which they were manufacturing in their father's carriage house) to bicycles. In 1904, Henley expanded his business to include the automotive industry. He built an auto agency and service garage on Main Street where he commenced selling and servicing vehicles. In 1906, he sold the business (the Auto Inn) and leased the real estate to a firm named of Draper & Whitsell. M.C. Henley grew his business operation from a small outbuilding at the rear of his parents‚Äô home at 309 N 14th Street, to a large modern factory which he built on North 16th Street, employing over 300 people. Always a competitor, he sponsored many local teams for racing and polo on skates, bicycles, horses, and later automobiles. Micajah C. Henley and his wife, Addie W. (1856-1943) are buried at Earlham Cemetery in Richmond, Indiana. Patents M.C. Henley held several U.S. Patents, a partial list is included below, along with reference numbers. * 234,404 - 11-16-1880 Roller Skate * 245,950 - 8-23-1881 Roller Skate * 285,484 - 9-25-1883 Powered Screw Driver * 319,712 - 6-9-1885 Roller Skate * 320,352 - 6-16-1885 Roller Skate toe clamp * 338,736 - 3-30-1886 Improved Roller Skate * 338,738 - 3-30-1886 Tension Device for making Wire Fencing * 383,730 - 5-29-1888 Power Drill * 396,279 - 1-15-1889 Fence Making Machine * 438,156 - 10-14-1890 Improved Lawn Mower * 446,448 - 2-17-1891 Pulley Lathe * 506,398 - 10-10-1893 5 Speed Transmission (to change Lathe Rotation Speed) * 518,670 - 4-24-1894 Improved Lawn Mower * 518,995 - 5-1-1894 Boiler Tube Cleaner * 755,133 - 3-22-1904 Coliseum Chair (theater seat) References * U.S. Patent Office Archives ** Brief Sketch of Micajah C.

It was first published in the 1996 compilation of short stories American Gothic Tales. Plot The story is about a woman who constantly hears a mysterious sound that at first sounds like an animal stranded within an area outside but the stronger the noise gets the more the woman realizes it is something else. The noise is horrid to hear according to Oates, \\"How like baby's cry, terribly distressing to hear! and the scratching which came in spasmodic, desperate flurries, was yet more distressing, evoking an obscure horror.\\" The more she hears this wretched noise, the more anxious she becomes to find the source. She finally sends herself on a mission, gathering her gardening tools and setting out to find where the noises are coming from. The more she digs, the closer she gets to the source, until she finds the source of the noise; a child's skull. She removes the years of dust from the skull, not much is left of it. There is no hair to uncover and there are some teeth missing. She begins to dig deeper where she found the skull and finds numerous pieces of bone, which lead her to believe that they are missing pieces of the child's skull. She brings the skull and the rest of the bones into her house where she wraps them in a velvet cloth and promises the skeleton that she will always be here for it, she will never leave it. She lays the skeleton near her bed in human form.

Whaley (born December 16, 1972) is an American football executive and former collegiate player. He is the current Senior Vice President of Football Operations for the XFL and from 2013 to 2017 was the general manager of the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League. Early life Whaley was born in Pittsburgh, where he played high school football and went on to play at the collegiate level. He played college football at Pitt as a defensive back, collecting 4 interceptions during his tenure. Career Pittsburgh Steelers Whaley worked for the Steelers as a pro personnel coordinator. He worked there for 10 years before accepting the Buffalo Bills job. Whaley worked directly under Kevin Colbert the Director of Football Operations. In his time with the Steelers, Whaley helped scout and draft defensive players such as Lamarr Woodley, Troy Polamalu and Lawrence Timmons. Buffalo Bills A heroically awful football mind who made countless uneducated and inflated draft choices that delayed Buffalo Bills greatness by at least 5 years. His career pinnacle was the hiring of Sean McDermott aka Sean McDaddy Process. Whaley was named assistant general manager and Director of Pro Personnel of the Buffalo Bills on February 10, 2010. Whaley oversaw the team's Pro Personnel department and assisted General Manager Buddy Nix in all football-related administrative duties and in the college talent evaluation process until Nix stepped down from the general manager position on May 13, 2013. Whaley became Buffalo's GM three days later. His most notable accomplishments with Buffalo included trading up to draft receiver Sammy Watkins and trading linebacker Kiko Alonso for All-Pro running back LeSean McCoy. Whaley was, in conjunction with owners Terry and Kim Pegula and President Russ Brandon, responsible for the hiring of head coach Rex Ryan. After Ryan was relieved of his duties, the team announced that Whaley would lead the search for Ryan's successor, Sean McDermott. On January 10, 2016, Whaley agreed to a contract extension offered to him by the Bills. Whaley, alongside his staff, was \\"relieved of his duties\\" by the Bills on April 30, 2017, following the 2017 NFL Draft. He spent the 2018 season as a recruiter for the NFLPA Collegiate Bowl. XFL On November 8, 2018, Whaley was hired as the senior vice president of football operations for the revival of the XFL. Controversies E-mail gaffe Whaley gained unwanted notoriety in 2007, when an inappropriate e-mail that he had sent to Steelers assistant coach Larry Zierlein was inadvertently forwarded by Zierlein to a large number of high-level NFL employees, including commissioner Roger Goodell. Zierlein apologized for the gaffe, and it is believed that neither he nor Whaley was disciplined by the team or the league. Radio remark In a May 2016 radio interview, Whaley said of football: \\"It's a violent game that I personally don't think humans are supposed to play.\\" Release of Fred Jackson Whaley was criticized by fans and players alike for his decision to cut longtime Bills running back and fan favorite Fred Jackson as a \\"business decision\\" prior to the 2015 NFL season, especially after allegedly telling Jackson his roster spot was safe. Jackson later reflected on the move prior to retiring with the Bills after Whaley's dismissal, stating that the manner in which he was cut left a \\"bad taste in his mouth\\" and that he was dumbfounded by it. Tyrod Taylor benching In December 2016, Whaley refused to explain his decision to bench the Bills' starting quarterback, Tyrod Taylor, prior to the last regular season game. Instead, interim head coach Anthony Lynn was forced to address questions from the media, and in an unscripted response, advised Taylor's benching was a 'business decision'. Whaley did not publicly comment on the decision.

He batted and threw right-handed. Texas Rangers Clancy attended St. Rita of Cascia High School on the south side of Chicago and was drafted by the Texas Rangers in the fourth round of the 1974 MLB Draft. Clancy played rookie level baseball with the Rangers Gulf Coast League team, where he had a record of 3-3 with a 2.72 ERA in nine starts. The Rangers moved Clancy up to the Anderson Rangers of the Western Carolinas League for the 1975 season, however, despite a respectable ERA of 3.83 in 23 starts, Clancy had a poor 6-13 record. Texas moved Clancy up to the San Antonio Brewers of the Texas League in 1976, however, he had a rough season, posting a record of 6-8 with a 6.41 in 23 starts. He was left unprotected in the 1976 MLB Expansion Draft, and was selected by the Toronto Blue Jays with the sixth pick. Toronto Blue Jays Clancy began his Blue Jays career playing with the Cleveland Indians AA affiliate, the Jersey City Indians of the Eastern League. Despite having a poor season with the team, where he had a 5-13 record and 4.88 ERA in 20 starts, the Blue Jays called him up to the Major League level. Clancy made his MLB debut on July 26, 1977, against the Texas Rangers at Exhibition Stadium. Clancy started the game, however, he lasted only two innings, allowing five runs as the Rangers routed Toronto 14-0. Clancy earned his first major league victory in his next start, pitching a complete game, allowing seven hits and one earned run as Toronto defeated the Milwaukee Brewers 3-2. Clancy would finish the year with a 4-9 record with a 5.05 ERA. In 1978, Clancy spent his first full season with the Blue Jays, earning a 10-12 record with a 4.09 ERA in 31 games. He had an injury plagued season in 1979, where he had a 2-7 record and a 5.51 ERA in 12 games. Clancy had a very solid season in 1980, as he had a 13-16 record with a 3.30 ERA and 15 complete games, before struggling in the 1981 season, as Clancy had a 6-12 record with a 4.90 ERA. In 1982, Clancy posted his first winning season, as he had a 16-14 record, starting a league high 40 games, and appearing in the 1982 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, where he pitched a perfect fourth inning. Clancy had another very solid season in 1983, compiling a record of 15-11 with a 3.91 ERA, as the Blue Jays had their first ever winning season. Clancy struggled in 1984, as he had a losing record for the first time in three seasons, with a 13-15 record, and a 4.64 ERA in a league high 36 starts. He led the league in earned runs allowed with 125. The 1985 season would be injury plagued, however, Clancy pitched effectively, earning a 9-6 record and a 3.78 ERA as Toronto made the post-season for the first time in team history. The injured Clancy pitched in only one inning in the 1985 ALCS as Toronto lost to the Kansas City Royals in seven games. He had a disappointing 1986 season, as Clancy posted a 14-14 record with a 3.94 ERA, followed by a strong year in 1987, in which he had a 15-11 record and a 3.54 ERA as the Blue Jays failed to qualify for the playoffs in both years. Clancy spent his final season with Toronto in 1988, where he struggled with a record of 11-13 and a 4.49 ERA, as the Jays once again missed the playoffs. Houston Astros Clancy became a free agent after the 1988 season, and signed a contract with the Houston Astros. He made his Astros debut on April 8, 1989, pitching 8.1 innings and allowing two runs in a 6-2 win over the San Diego Padres at The Astrodome. He would struggle as the season went along, sporting a record of 7-14 with a 5.08 ERA as the Astros finished in third place in the National League West. Clancy split time between starting and working out of the bullpen in 1990, where he struggled with a 2-8 record and a 6.51 ERA, and had a stint with the Tucson Toros, the Astros AAA affiliate in the Pacific Coast League. In 1991, Clancy spent the season working out of the bullpen, and despite a 0-3 record, he was effective, as he had a 2.78 ERA in 30 games and earned five saves. On July 31, 1991, Clancy was traded to the Atlanta Braves for Matt Turner.Athletics beat clock for Darling Atlanta Braves Clancy appeared in 24 games with the Atlanta Braves, all out of the bullpen, as he posted a 3-2 record with a 5.71 ERA, helping Atlanta win the National League West division. In the 1991 NLCS, Clancy made only one appearance, getting the only batter out that he faced as the Braves defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates to earn a spot in the World Series.

The show starred brother-and-sister pop duo Donny and Marie Osmond. Donny had first become popular singing in a music group with his brothers, The Osmonds, and Marie was one of the youngest singers to reach No. 1 on the Billboard country music charts (with \\"Paper Roses\\", in 1973). The siblings were offered a weekly show by ABC-TV President Fred Silverman after he saw the duo co-host a week on The Mike Douglas Show which followed their series of popular remakes of oldies, such as \\"I'm Leaving It All Up to You\\", \\"Morning Side of the Mountain\\" and \\"Make the World Go Away\\". Donny and Marie (18 and 16 years old, respectively, when the program premiered) were the youngest entertainers in TV history to host their own variety show. A year later, The Keane Brothers would break this record. Overview Donny & Marie was a Friday night show that consisted of an ice skating number intro, comedy skits, followed by songs performed by the duo. The most famous song performed on the show was \\"I'm a Little Bit Country, I'm a Little Bit Rock and Roll\\", which formed the basis of a weekly segment (the \\"Concert Spot\\") in which Marie (\\"a little bit country\\") would trade off singing a country music song with Donny (\\"I'm a little bit rock and roll\\") singing a rock and roll song. Each episode concluded with a musical finale and a cascade of balloons from the ceiling, matched to the colors of the sets and costumes. Donny and Marie would then sing their trademark closing song which was written by Alan Osmond, \\"May Tomorrow Be a Perfect Day\\". Occasionally, the show would feature roughly 15-minute musical adaptations of famous feature films, such as Star Wars and The Wizard of Oz, with a mix of original cast members and celebrity guest stars (Paul Lynde and Ruth Buzzi were semi-regulars for the tun of the series; Lynde's appearance was part of a burn-off to fulfill Lynde's contract with ABCBruce Vilanch on \\"The Paul Lynde Halloween Special\\". Archive of American Television Interviews via YouTube (August 2, 2016). Retrieved February 26, 2020.). The show was shown in the UK on Sunday afternoon on BBC1, where it was always billed as \\"The Osmonds\\". The show's popularity declined in its final two seasons after it was revealed that teen heartthrob Donny was dating (and eventually married) fellow Utahn Debbie Glenn, therefore taking him 'off the market' of eligible bachelors, and it aired on the same time slot with Wonder Woman. According to an edition of the VH1 series Behind the Music, many female viewers started to tune out at this point. The series also underwent a format change in the final season, eliminating segments such as the ice skaters and country/rock-n-roll segments in favor of more concert-style disco numbers. The show was also retitled The Osmond Family Show midway through the season, and was moved from the Friday night timeslot that it had occupied since its debut to Sunday night; the program increasingly featured the Osmond Brothers in larger roles. The variety show genre as a whole, at the time, was in steep decline, and the success of Donny & Marie was somewhat of an aberration compared to the trends of television in the late 1970s (two of the last successful variety shows, The Sonny & Cher Show and The Carol Burnett Show, left the air in 1977 and 1978, respectively). The 1980‚Äì1981 TV season featured Marie with a Bob Mackie fashion make-over and starring in her own solo variety series on NBC called Marie, which was also produced at Silverman's behest and attempted to follow a similar format. It was a replacement series and contracted for only seven episodes. Donny and Marie teamed up again in 1998 to co-host Donny & Marie (also known as The Donny and Marie Hour and The Donny and Marie Show), a talk show that ran for two seasons. They continue to perform live, most recently for a long-term residency at the Flamingo Las Vegas. Merchandising *Donny & Marie dolls with an accompanying \\"TV Studio\\" play set were released in August 1976. *A Donny & Marie wireless toy microphone, that transmitted to AM radio frequencies, was released in 1977. The design was based on the white Shure SM61 mics used on the show. (The songs on the show were all lip-synched. The mics were just props, with an XLR plug and an antenna attached, to make them look real.) *Tiger Beat published a Donny & Marie magazine during the run of the series that focused on the personal lives of the two singers, as well as frequent profiles of other Osmond family members. The magazine, which ended around the same time the TV series did, was published with the support of the family and included advertisements for Osmond-related merchandise. Production notes Originally, the show was created by Sid & Marty Krofft and videotaped in Los Angeles at KTLA Studios (known as the Golden West Videotape Division, and now known as the Old Warner Brothers Studio), but creative control of the show was given to the Osmonds after a long battle, and Donny & Marie was moved to the Osmond Studios (known as the Osmond Entertainment Center) in Orem, Utah in November 1977. The popularity of the series resulted in Donny and Marie filming the movie Goin' Coconuts during its spring 1978 production hiatus, in which they played fictionalized versions of themselves. The show ranked 35th out of 104 shows for the 1977-78 season, with an average 19.3 rating,https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX- Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/78-OCR/1978-05-01-BC-OCR-Page-0036.pdf and ranked 63rd out of 114 shows for the 1978-79 season, with a 16.3/28 average rating/share.https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX- Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/79-OCR/BC-1979-06-18-OCR- Page-0056.pdf#search=%22rounding%20up%20the%20ratings%22 List of guest stars A *Jack Albertson *Paul Anka *Desi Arnaz *Desi Arnaz Jr. B *Pearl Bailey *Lucille Ball *Joe Baker *Carl Ballantine *Kylene Barker *Billy Barty *Dirk Benedict *Edgar Bergen *Milton Berle *Chuck Berry *Fred Berry *Ken Berry *Big Bird *Ray Bolger *Debby Boone *Tom Bosley *Tybee Brascia *Gary Burghoff *George Burns *Raymond Burr *Levar Burton *Ruth Buzzi C *Glen Campbell *Harry Wayne Casey *Jim Connell *Cyd Charisse *Charo *Chubby Checker *Roy Clark *Robert Conrad *Bert Convy *Rita Coolidge *David Copperfield (illusionist) *Billy Crystal D *Anthony Daniels *Mac Davis *Jack DeLeon *Bo Diddley *Joyce DeWitt E *Barbara Eden *Georgia Engel *Erik Estrada *Dale Evans *Chad Everett *Greg Evigan F * Lola Falana * Farrah Fawcett *Peggy Fleming *Redd Foxx G *Leif Garrett *Andy Gibb *George Gobel *Arthur Godfrey *Grant Goodeve *Lorne Greene *Andy Griffith H *Buddy Hackett *Merle Haggard *Monty Hall *Dorothy Hamill *The Harlem Globetrotters *Billie Hayes *Robert Hegyes *Sherman Hemsley *Florence Henderson *Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs *Bob Hope *Ron Howard *Engelbert Humperdinck *Rick Hurst J *Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs *Sonny James *Tom Jones K *Gabe Kaplan *Kaptain Kool & The Kongs *Alex Karras *KC and the Sunshine Band *Roz Kelly *Bruce Kimmel *Christopher Knight *Ted Knight *Evel Knievel *Don Knotts *Harvey Korman *Kris Kristofferson L *Cheryl Ladd *Michael Landon *Lassie *Meadowlark Lemon *Jerry Lewis *Hal Linden *Art Linkletter *Little Richard *Rich Little *Mike Lookinland *Paul Lynde *Loretta Lynn M *Gavin MacLeod *Peter Mayhew *Larry Mahan *Lee Majors *Patty Maloney *Barry Manilow * Jim Marks *Penny Marshall *Tony Martin *Andrea McArdle *Maureen McCormick *Kristy McNichol *Anne Meara *Sidney Miller *Erin Moran *Donny Most N *Jim Nabors *Haywood Nelson *Olivia Newton-John *Chuck Norris O *Susan Olsen *The Osmonds P *Ron Palillo *Minnie Pearl *Susan Perkins *Bernadette Peters *Mackenzie Phillips *Billy Preston *Vincent Price *Charley Pride R *Robert Reed *Carl Reiner *Geri Reischl *Debbie Reynolds *Adam Rich *Susan Richardson *Cathy Rigby *Roy Rogers *Esther Rolle *Marion Ross *Nipsey Russell S *Isabel Sanford *Neil Sedaka *Shabba-Doo *Buffalo Bob Smith *Jaclyn Smith *Kate Smith *Keely Smith *Suzanne Somers *Sonny & Cher *Ken Stabler *Connie Stevens *McLean Stevenson *Parker Stevenson *Gail Storm *Loretta Swit *The Sunshine Band *The Sylvers *Seals and Crofts T *Fran Tarkenton *Rip Taylor *Danny Thomas *Ernest Thomas *Cheryl Tiegs *Mel Tillis *Fred Travalena *Joey Travolta *Tanya Tucker *Tina Turner V * Abe Vigoda *Karen Valentine *Barry Van Dyke *Dick Van Dyke *Dick Van Patten *Ben Vereen W *Jimmie Walker *John Wayne *Raquel Welch *Betty White *Fred Willard *Andy Williams *Anson Williams *Barry Williams *Cindy Williams *Paul Williams *Henry Winkler *Wolfman Jack Y *Robert Young References External links * * *Osmond.com - Donny & Marie feature Category:American Broadcasting Company original programming Category:1970s American music television series Category:English-language television shows Category:Television series by Sid and Marty Krofft Television Productions Category:1976 American television series debuts Category:1979 American television series endings Category:1970s American variety television series Category:Television shows filmed in Utah ","title":"Donny &amp; Marie (1976 TV series)"},{"id":"21624212","text":"The Artizans, Labourers & General Dwellings Company (Artizans Company) was a nineteenth-century philanthropic model dwellings company, which later became a multinational property developer before being absorbed into Sun Life. Origins The Artizans Company was established in 1867 by William Austin, an illiterate who had begun his working life on a farm as a scarecrow paid 1d per day,Long, p. 3 and had worked his way up to become a drainage contractor. The company was established as a for-profit joint stock company, with the objective of building new houses for the working classes \\"in consequence of the destruction of houses by railroads and other improvements\\".Welch, p. 8 The company aimed to fuse the designs of rural planned suburbs such as Bedford Park with the ethos of high-quality homes for the lower classes pioneered at Saltaire.Welch, p. 7 Whilst earlier philanthropic housing companies such as the Peabody Trust and the Improved Industrial Dwellings Company focused on multi-storey blocks of flats in the inner cities, the Artizans Company aimed to build low-rise housing in open countryside alongside existing railway lines to allow workers to live in the countryside and commute into the city.Welch, p. 9 The company attracted the attention of Lord Shaftesbury, who served as president until 1875. The company built and immediately sold a group of houses in Battersea, then still a rural village. The proceeds of the sale were used to purchase a plot of land in Salford for development, and by 1874 the company had developments in Liverpool, Birmingham, Gosport and Leeds. London estates Company emblem above the door on the Shaftesbury Park Estate The Artizans Company is best known for its four large housing estates built on the then-outskirts of London. The first was Shaftesbury Park, a development of 1,200 two-storey houses covering built in 1872 on the site of a former pig farm in Battersea. The success of Shaftesbury Park led to the construction of Queen's Park, built in 1874 on a far more ambitious scale on of land to the west of London, adjacent to the railway line out of Paddington (Queen's Park station opened 1879), purchased from All Souls College, Oxford. A third London estate was planned at Cann Hall, and a site of was purchased. However, the Queen's Park project suffered serious mismanagement and fraud and in 1877 the company secretary William Swindlehurst and two others were found guilty of defrauding ¬£9,312 (approximately ¬£ today) from the project. The company was forced to raise rents and tenants were no longer permitted to buy their houses; by 1880 the company's finances had recovered sufficiently to allow further expansion.Welch, p. 10 A third estate, Noel Park, was built near Wood Green north of London between 1883 and 1929, followed by a fourth in Streatham at Leigham Court. The slow take-up of available homes in Noel Park, particularly due to the Great Eastern Railway's refusal to offer third-class rail fares from the nearby Noel Park and Wood Green station, led the Company to begin building centrally located tenement blocks more similar to those of other model dwellings companies. Between 1885 and 1892, the Artizans Company built 1,467 dwellings in Central London and the West End, the first being the Portman Buildings in Lisson Grove, Marylebone, opened in 1888. Diversification and divestment In 1952, the Artizans, Labourers & General Dwellings Company was renamed the Artizans and General Properties Company Ltd. The combination of a taxation system biased against private property developments and legal restrictions on raising rents made the company's traditional model unprofitable, and it began to divest itself of its original low-rent developments and instead to sell vacant houses on the estates and to reinvest in non low-rent housing and commercial property, especially in the United States and Canada where depreciation before tax was permitted, and in Australia, Belgium and France. In 1966, ownership of the four original London estates (Shaftesbury Park, Queen's Park, Noel Park and Leigham Court) was transferred to the respective local authorities,Welch, p. 50 leaving 377 homes at Pinnerwood Park in Pinner as the last residential estate in Greater London owned by the company. In 1976, the Artizans Company, by then renamed Artagen Properties Ltd, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Sun Life, and on, 3 February 1981, the company was renamed Sun Life Properties Ltd.

The region of Nubia was an early cradle of civilization, producing several complex societies that engaged in trade and industry. The city-state of Kerma emerged as the dominant political force between 2450 and 1450 BC, controlling the Nile Valley between the first and fourth cataracts, an area as large as Egypt. The Egyptians were the first to identify Kerma as ‚ÄúKush\\", and over the next several centuries the two civilizations engaged in intermittent warfare, trade, and cultural exchange.Alberge, Dalya. \\"Tomb reveals Ancient Egypt's humiliating secret\\". The Times. London. Much of Nubia came under Egyptian rule during the New Kingdom period (1550-1070 BC). Following Egypt's disintegration amid the Late Bronze Age collapse, the Kushites reestablished a kingdom in Napata (now modern Karima, Sudan). Though Kush had developed many cultural affinities with Egypt, such as the veneration of Amun, and the royal families of both kingdoms often intermarried, Kushite culture was distinct; Egyptian art distinguished the people of Kush by their dress, appearance, and even method of transportation. King Kashta (\\"the Kushite\\") peacefully became King of Upper and Lower Egypt, while his daughter, Amenirdis, was appointed as Divine Adoratrice of amun in Thebes. Piye invaded Egypt in the eighth century BC, establishing the Kushite-ruled Twenty-fifth Dynasty. Piye's daughter, Shepenupet II, was also appointed Divine Adoratrice of amun. The monarchs of Kush ruled Egypt for over a century until the Assyrian conquest, finally being expelled by the Egyptian Psamtik I in the mid seventh century BC. Following the severing of ties with Egypt, the Kushite imperial capital was located at Mero√´, during which time it was known by the Greeks as Aethiopia. The Kingdom of Kush persisted as a major regional power until the fourth century AD, when it weakened and disintegrated from internal rebellion. Mero√´ was captured and destroyed by the Kingdom of Aksum, marking the end of the kingdom and its dissolution into the three polities of Nobatia, Makuria and Alodia. Long overshadowed by its more prominent Egyptian neighbor, archaeological discoveries since the late 20th century have revealed Kush to be an advanced civilization in its own right. The Kushites had their own unique language and script; maintained a complex economy based on trade and industry; mastered archery; and developed a complex, urban society with uniquely high levels of female participation.  Name  The native name of the Kingdom was recorded in Egyptian as ', likely pronounced or in Middle Egyptian, when the term was first used for Nubia, based on the New Kingdom-era Akkadian transliteration as the genitive k≈´si. It is also an ethnic term for the native population who initiated the kingdom of Kush. The term is also displayed in the names of Kushite persons,T√∂r√∂k, L√°szl√≥. Der Nahe und Mittlere Osten. BRILL, 1997. Print. such as King Kashta (a transcription of k3≈°-t3 \\"(one from) the land of Kush\\"). Geographically, Kush referred to the region south of the first cataract in general. Kush also was the home of the rulers of the 25th Dynasty.Van, de M. M. A History of Ancient Egypt. Chichester, West Sussex: Wiley-Blackwell, 2011. Print. The name Kush, since at least the time of Josephus, has been connected with the biblical character Cush, in the Hebrew Bible (), son of Ham (Genesis 10:6). Ham had four sons named: Cush, Put, Canaan and Mizraim (Hebrew name for Egypt). According to the Bible, Nimrod, a son of Cush, was the founder and king of Babylon, Erech, Akkad and Calneh, in Shinar (Gen 10:10). The Bible also makes reference to someone named Cush who is a Benjamite (Psalms 7:1, KJV). In Greek sources Kush was known as Kous (ŒöŒøœÖœÇ) or Aethiopia (Œë·º∞Œ∏ŒπŒøœÄŒØŒ±).T√∂r√∂k (1997), p. 69ff. History  Origins  Statue of the Kushite pharaoh Aspelta, Napata period () Mentuhotep II, the 21st century BC founder of the Middle Kingdom, is recorded to have undertaken campaigns against Kush in the 29th and 31st years of his reign. This is the earliest Egyptian reference to Kush; the Nubian region had gone by other names in the Old Kingdom.Historical Dictionary of Ancient and Medieval Nubia, Richard A. Lobban Jr., p. 254. Under Thutmose I, Egypt made several campaigns south.De Mola, Paul J. \\"Interrelations of Kerma and Pharaonic Egypt\\". Ancient History Encyclopedia: http://www.ancient.eu/article/487/ This eventually resulted in their annexation of Nubia . After the conquest, Kerma culture was increasingly Egyptianized, yet rebellions continued for 220 years until . Nubia nevertheless became a key province of the New Kingdom, economically, politically and spiritually. Indeed, major pharonic ceremonies were held at Jebel Barkal near Napata. As an Egyptian colony from the 16th century BC, Nubia (\\"Kush\\") was governed by an Egyptian Viceroy of Kush. With the disintegration of the New Kingdom around 1070 BC, Kush became an independent kingdom centered at Napata in modern northern Sudan.Morkot, Robert G. \\"On the Priestly Origin of the Napatan Kings: The Adaptation, Demise and Resurrection of Ideas in Writing Nubian History\\" in O'Connor, David and Andrew Reid, eds. Ancient Egypt in Africa (Encounters with Ancient Egypt) (University College London Institute of Archaeology Publications) Left Coast Press (1 Aug 2003) p.151 The extent of cultural/political continuity between the Kerma culture and the chronologically succeeding Kingdom of Kush is difficult to determine. The latter polity began to emerge around 1000 BC, 500 years after the end of the Kingdom of Kerma. By 1200 BC, Egyptian involvement in the Dongola Reach was nonexistent. By the 8th century BC, the new Kushite kingdom emerged from the Napata region of the upper Dongola Reach. The first Napatan king, Alara, dedicated his sister to the cult of Amun at the rebuilt Kawa temple, while temples were also rebuilt at Barkal and Kerma. A Kashta stele at Elephantine, places the Kushites on the Egyptian frontier by the mid-eighteenth century. This first period of the kingdom's history, the 'Napatan', was succeeded by the 'Meroitic', when the royal cemeteries relocated to Mero√´ around 300 BC. The Kushites buried their monarchs along with all their courtiers in mass graves. Archaeologists refer to these practices as the \\"Pan-grave culture\\".Pan Grave Culture ‚Äì By K. Kris Hirst This was given its name due to the way in which the remains are buried. They would dig a pit and put stones around them in a circle. ‚Äì By Manfred Bietak Kushites also built burial mounds and pyramids, and shared some of the same gods worshiped in Egypt, especially Ammon and Isis. With the worshiping of these gods, the Kushites began to take some of the names of the gods as their throne names. The Kush rulers were regarded as guardians of the state religion and were responsible for maintaining the houses of the gods. Some scholars believe the economy in the Kingdom of Kush was a redistributive system. The state would collect taxes in the form of surplus produce and would redistribute to the people. Others believe that most of the society worked on the land and required nothing from the state and did not contribute to the state. Northern Kush seems to have been more productive and wealthier than the Southern area.Welsby, Derek A. The Kingdom of Kush: the Napatan and Meroitic Empires. Princeton, NJ: Markus Wiener, 1998. Google Scholar. Web. 20 Oct. 2011 Dental trait analysis of fossils dating from the Meroitic period in Semna, northern Nubia, found that they displayed traits similar to those of populations inhabiting the Nile, Horn of Africa, and Maghreb. Traits from mesolithic and southern Nubia around Meroe however indicated a closer affinity with other sub-Saharan dental records. It is indicative of a north-south gradient along the Nile river. Napatan period (750-542 BC) =Nubian conquest of Egypt (25th Dynasty)= Statues of various rulers of the late 25th Dynasty‚Äìearly Napatan period: Tantamani, Taharqa (rear), Senkamanisken, again Tantamani (rear), Aspelta, Anlamani, again Senkamanisken. Kerma Museum. Resistance to the early eighteenth Dynasty Egyptian rule by neighbouring Kush is evidenced in the writings of Ahmose, son of Ebana, an Egyptian warrior who served under Nebpehtrya Ahmose (1539-1514 BC), Djeserkara Amenhotep I (1514‚Äì1493 BC) and Aakheperkara Thutmose I (1493‚Äì1481 BC). At the end of the Second Intermediate Period (mid-sixteenth century BC), Egypt faced the twin existential threats‚Äîthe Hyksos in the North and the Kushites in the South. Taken from the autobiographical inscriptions on the walls of his tomb-chapel, the Egyptians undertook campaigns to defeat Kush and conquer Nubia under the rule of Amenhotep I (1514‚Äì1493 BC). In Ahmose's writings, the Kushites are described as archers, \\"Now after his Majesty had slain the Bedoin of Asia, he sailed upstream to Upper Nubia to destroy the Nubian bowmen.\\" The tomb writings contain two other references to the Nubian bowmen of Kush. Egypt's international prestige had declined considerably towards the end of the Third Intermediate Period. Its historical allies, the inhabitants of Canaan, had fallen to the Middle Assyrian Empire (1365-1020 BC), and then the resurgent Neo-Assyrian Empire (935‚Äì605 BC). The Assyrians, from the 10th century BC onwards, had once more expanded from northern Mesopotamia, and conquered a vast empire, including the whole of the Near East, and much of Anatolia, the eastern Mediterranean, the Caucasus and early Iron Age Iran. In 945 BC, Shoshenq I and Libu princes took control of the Nile Delta and founded the Twenty-second Dynasty of Egypt, also known as the Libyan or Bubastite dynasty, which would rule for some 200 years. Shoshenq also gained control of southern Egypt by placing his family members in important priestly positions. In 711, Shoshenq made Memphis his northern capital.Van, de M. M. A History of Ancient Egypt. Chichester, West Sul\\"ssex: Wiley-Blackwell, 2011. p289. Print. However, Libyan control began to erode as a rival dynasty in the delta arose in Leontopolis and Kushites threatened from the south. Amun temple of Jebel Barkal, originally built during the Egyptian New Kingdom but greatly enhanced by Piye Alara founded the Napatan, or 25th, Kushite dynasty at Napata in Nubia, now Sudan. Alara's successor Kashta extended Kushite control north to Elephantine and Thebes in Upper Egypt. Kashta's successor Piye seized control of Lower Egypt around 727 BC.Shaw (2002) p. 345 Piye's 'Victory Stela', celebrating these campaigns between 728-716 BC, was found in the Amun temple at Jebel Barkal. He invaded an Egypt fragmented into four kingdoms, ruled by King Peftjauawybast, King Nimlot, King Iuput II, and King Osorkon IV. Why the Kushites chose to enter Egypt at this crucial point of foreign domination is subject to debate. Archaeologist Timothy Kendall offers his own hypotheses, connecting it to a claim of legitimacy associated with Jebel Barkal.Kendall, T.K., 2002. Napatan Temples: a Case Study from Gebel Barkal. The Mythological Nubian Origin of Egyptian Kingship and the Formation of the Napatan State. Tenth International Conference of Nubian Studies. Rome, September 9‚Äì14, 2002. Kendall cites the Victory Stele of Piye at Jebel Barkal, which states that \\"Amun of Napata granted me to be ruler of every foreign country,\\" and \\"Amun in Thebes granted me to be ruler of the Black Land (Kmt)\\". According to Kendall, \\"foreign lands\\" in this regard seems to include Lower Egypt while \\"Kmt\\" seems to refer to a united Upper Egypt and Nubia. Piye's successor, Shabaqo, defeated the Saite kings of northern Egypt between 711-710 BC, and installed himself as king in Memphis. He then established ties with Sargon II. Relief from the Temple of Amun, Jebel Barkal, showing a battle between Kushites and Assyrians Piye's son, Taharqa's army undertook successful military campaigns, as attested by the \\"list of conquered Asiatic principalities\\" from the Mut temple at Karnak and \\"conquered peoples and countries (Libyans, Shasu nomads, Phoenicians?, Khor in Palestine)\\" from Sanam temple inscriptions. Imperial ambitions of the Mesopotamian based Assyrian Empire made war with the 25th dynasty inevitable. In 701 BC, Taharqa and his army aided Judah and King Hezekiah in withstanding a siege by King Sennacherib of the Assyrians (2 Kings 19:9; Isaiah 37:9). There are various theories (Taharqa's army, disease, divine intervention, Hezekiah's surrender) as to why the Assyrians failed to take the city and withdrew to Assyria. Torok mentions that Egypt's army \\"was beaten at Eltekeh\\" under Taharqa's command, but \\"the battle could be interpreted as a victory for the double kingdom\\", since Assyria did not take Jerusalem and \\"retreated to Assyria.\\" Pyramids of Nuri, built between the reigns of Taharqa (circa 670 BC) and Nastasen (circa 310 BC). The power of the 25th Dynasty reached a climax under Taharqa. The Nile valley empire was as large as it had been since the New Kingdom. New prosperityT√∂r√∂k, L√°szl√≥.

Religion, the arts, and architecture were restored to their glorious Old, Middle, and New Kingdom forms. The Nubian pharaohs built or restored temples and monuments throughout the Nile valley, including Memphis, Karnak, Kawa, and Jebel Barkal. It was during the 25th dynasty that the Nile valley saw the first widespread construction of pyramids (many in modern Sudan) since the Middle Kingdom. The Kushites developed their own script, the Meroitic alphabet, which was influenced by Egyptian writing systems , although it appears to have been wholly confined to the royal court and major temples. =Assyrian conquest of Egypt= King Senkamanisken slaying enemies at Jebel Barkal. Taharqa initially defeated the Assyrians when war broke out in 674 BC. Yet, in 671 BC, the Assyrian King Esarhaddon started the Assyrian conquest of Egypt, took Memphis, and Taharqo retreated to the south, while his heir and other family members were taken to Assyria as prisoners. However, the native Egyptian vassal rulers installed by Esarhaddon as puppets were unable to effectively retain full control, and Taharqa was able regain control of Memphis. Esarhaddon's 669 BC campaign to once more eject Taharqa was abandoned when Esarhaddon died in Palestine on the way to Egypt. Yet, Esarhaddon's successor, Ashurbanipal, did defeat Taharqa, and Taharqa died soon after in 664 BCE. Taharqa's successor, Tantamani sailed north from Napata, through Elephantine, and to Thebes with a large army to Thebes, where he was \\"ritually installed as the king of Egypt.\\" From Thebes, Tantamani began his reconquest and regained control of Egypt, as far north as Memphis. Tantamani's dream stele states that he restored order from the chaos, where royal temples and cults were not being maintained. After defeating Sais and killing Assyria's vassal, Necho I, in Memphis, \\"some local dynasts formally surrendered, while others withdrew to their fortresses.\\" Tantamani proceeded north of Memphis, invading Lower Egypt and, besieged cities in the Delta, a number of which surrendered to him. The Assyrians, who had a military presence in the Levant, then sent a large army southwards in 663 BC. Tantamani was routed, and the Assyrian army sacked Thebes to such an extent it never truly recovered. Tantamani was chased back to Nubia, but his control over Upper Egypt endured until c. 656 BC. At this date, a native Egyptian ruler, Psamtik I son of Necho, placed on the throne as a vassal of Ashurbanipal, took control of Thebes.Georges Roux ‚Äì Ancient Iraq pp. 330‚Äì332 The last links between Kush and Upper Egypt were severed after hostilities with the Saite kings in the 590s BC. The Kushites used the animal- driven water wheel to increase productivity and create a surplus, particularly during the Napatan-Meroitic Kingdom.William Y. Adams, Nubia: Corridor to Africa (Princeton University Press, 1977) 346-47, and William Y. Adams, =Achaemenid period= Kushite delegation on a Persian relief from the Apadana palace () Herodotus mentioned an invasion of Kush by the Achaemenid ruler Cambyses (). By some accounts Cambyses succeeded in occupying the area between the first and second Nile cataract, however Herodotus mentions that \\"his expedition failed miserably in the desert.\\" Achaemenid inscriptions from both Egypt and Iran include Kush as part of the Achaemenid empire. For example, the DNa inscription of Darius I () on his tomb at Naqsh-e Rustam mentions K≈´≈°ƒ´yƒÅ (Old Persian cuneiform: êé§êé¢êèÅêé°êéπêé†, pronounced K≈´shƒ´yƒÅ) among the territories being \\"ruled over\\" by the Achaemenid Empire.Line 30 of the DNa inscription Derek Welsby states \\"scholars have doubted that this Persian expedition ever took place, but... archaeological evidence suggests that the fortress of Dorginarti near the second cataract served as Persia's southern boundary.\\" Meroitic period (542 BC-4th century AD) Kushite civilization continued for several centuries. According to Welsby, \\"throughout the Saite, Persian, Ptolemaic, and Roman periods, the Kushite rulers - the descendants of the XXVth Dynasty pharaohs, and the guardians of the Temple of Amun at Jebel Barkal \\\\- could have pressed their 'legitimate' claim for control of Egypt and they thus posed a potential threat to the rulers of Egypt.\\" Aspelta moved the capital to Mero√´, considerably farther south than Napata, possibly c. 591 BC, just after the sack of Napata by Psamtik II. Martin Meredith states the Kushite rulers chose Mero√´, between the Fifth and Sixth Cataracts, because it was on the fringe of the summer rainfall belt, and the area was rich in iron ore and hardwood for iron working. The location also afforded access to trade routes to the Red Sea. The Kush traded iron products with the Romans, in addition to gold, ivory and slaves. Yet, the Butana plain was stripped of its forests, leaving behind slag piles. Jewelry found on the Mummy of Nubian King Amaninatakilebte (538-519 BCE), Nuri pyramid 10. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Gold flower shaped diadem, found in the Pyramid of King Talakhamani (435‚Äì431 BCE), Nuri pyramid 16. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. In about 300 BC the move to Mero√´ was made more complete when the monarchs began to be buried there, instead of at Napata. One theory is that this represents the monarchs breaking away from the power of the priests at Napata. According to Diodorus Siculus, a Kushite king, \\"Ergamenes\\", defied the priests and had them slaughtered. This story may refer to the first ruler to be buried at Mero√´ with a similar name such as Arqamani,Fage, J. D.: Roland Anthony Oliver (1979) The Cambridge History of Africa, Cambridge University Press. p. 228 who ruled many years after the royal cemetery was opened at Mero√´. During this same period, Kushite authority may have extended some 1,500 km along the Nile River valley from the Egyptian frontier in the north to areas far south of modern Khartoum and probably also substantial territories to the east and west.Edwards, page 141 =Ptolemaic period= There is no record of conflict between the Kushites and Ptolemies. However, there was a serious revolt at the end of Ptolemy IV and the Kushites likely tried to interfere in Ptolemaic affairs. It's suggested that this led to Ptolemy V defacing the name of Arqamani on inscriptions at Philae. \\"Arqamani constructed a small entrance hall to the temple built by Ptolemy IV at selchis and constructed a temple at Philae to which Ptolemy contributed an entrance hall.\\" There's evidence of Ptolemaic occupation as far south as the 2nd cataract, but recent finds at Qasr Ibrim, such as \\"the total absence of Ptolemaic pottery\\" have cast doubts on the effectiveness of the occupation. Dynastic struggles led to the Ptolemies abandoning the area, so \\"the Kushites reasserted their control...with Qasr Ibrim occupied\\" (by the Kushites) and other locations perhaps garrisoned. =Roman period= According to Welsby, after the Romans assumed control of Egypt, they negotiated with the Kushites at Philae and drew the southern border of Roman Egypt at Aswan. Theodor Mommsen and Welsby state the Kingdom of Kush became a client Kingdom, which was similar to the situation under Ptolemaic rule of Egypt. Kushite ambition and excessive Roman taxation are two theories for a revolt that was supported by Kushite armies. The ancient historians, Strabo and Pliny, give accounts of the conflict with Roman Egypt. Meroitic prince smiting his enemies (early first century AD)Strabo describes a war with the Romans in the first century BC. According to Strabo, the Kushites \\"sacked Aswan with an army of 30,000 men and destroyed imperial statues...at Philae.\\" a \\"fine over-life-size bronze head of the emperor Augustus\\" was found buried in Meroe in front of a temple. After the initial victories of Kandake (or \\"Candace\\") Amanirenas against Roman Egypt, the Kushites were defeated and Napata sacked.Arthur E. Robinson, \\"The Arab Dynasty of Dar For (Darfur): Part II\\", Journal of the Royal African Society (Lond). XXVIII: 55‚Äì67 (October, 1928) Remarkably, the destruction of the capital of Napata was not a crippling blow to the Kushites and did not frighten Candace enough to prevent her from again engaging in combat with the Roman military. In 22 BC, a large Kushite force moved northward with intention of attacking Qasr Ibrim. Alerted to the advance, Petronius again marched south and managed to reach Qasr Ibrim and bolster its defences before the invading Kushites arrived. Welsby states after a Kushite attack on Primis (Qasr Ibrim), the Kushites sent ambassadors to negotiate a peace settlement with Petronius. The Kushites succeeded in negotiating a peace treaty on favourable terms. Trade between the two nations increased and the Roman Egyptian border being extended to \\"Hiera Sykaminos (Maharraqa).\\" This arrangement \\"guaranteed peace for most of the next 300 years\\" and there's \\"no definite evidence of further clashes.\\" It is possible that the Roman emperor Nero planned another attempt to conquer Kush before his death in AD 68. Nero sent two centurions upriver as far as Bahr el Ghazal River in 66 AD in an attempt to discover the source of the Nile, per Senecas, or plan an attack, per Pliny. Kush began to fade as a power by the 1st or 2nd century AD, sapped by the war with the Roman province of Egypt and the decline of its traditional industries. However, we have evidence of 3rd century AD Kushite Kings at Philae in demotic and inscription. It's been suggested that the Kushites reoccupied lower Nubia after Roman forces were withdrawn to Aswan. Kushite activities led others to note \\"a de facto Kushite control of that area (as far north as Philae) for part of the 3rd century AD. Thereafter, it weakened and disintegrated due to internal rebellion. The seat was eventually captured and burnt to the ground by the Kingdom of Aksum. Christianity began to gain over the old pharaonic religion and by the mid- sixth century AD the Kingdom of Kush was dissolved.  Language and Writing Meroitic ostracon The Meroitic language was spoken in Mero√´ and the Sudan during the Meroitic period (attested from 300 BC). It became extinct about 400 AD. It is uncertain to which language family the Meroitic language is related. Kirsty Rowan suggests that Meroitic, like the Egyptian language, belongs to the Afro-Asiatic family. She bases this on its sound inventory and phonotactics, which she argues are similar to those of the Afro-Asiatic languages and dissimilar from those of the Nilo-Saharan languages.Rowan, Kirsty (2011). \\"Meroitic Consonant and Vowel Patterning\\". Lingua Aegytia, 19.Rowan, Kirsty (2006), \\"Meroitic - An Afroasiatic Language?\\" Working Papers in Linguistics 14:169‚Äì206. Claude Rilly proposes that Meroitic, like the Nobiin language, belongs to the Eastern Sudanic branch of the Nilo-Saharan family, based in part on its syntax, morphology, and known vocabulary. In the Napatan Period Egyptian hieroglyphs were used: at this time writing seems to have been restricted to the court and temples. From the 2nd century BC there was a separate Meroitic writing system. The language was written in two forms of the Meroitic alphabet: Meroitic Cursive, which was written with a stylus and was used for general record-keeping; and Meroitic Hieroglyphic, which was carved in stone or used for royal or religious documents. It is not well understood due to the scarcity of bilingual texts. The earliest inscription in Meroitic writing dates from between 180‚Äì170 BC. These hieroglyphics were found engraved on the temple of Queen Shanakdakhete. Meroitic Cursive is written horizontally, and reads from right to left like all Semitic orthographies. This was an alphabetic script with 23 signs used in a hieroglyphic form (mainly on monumental art) and in a cursive form. The latter was widely used; so far some 1278 texts using this version are known (Leclant 2000). The script was deciphered by Griffith, but the language behind it is still a problem, with only a few words understood by modern scholars. It is not as yet possible to connect the Meroitic language with other known languages. For a time, it was also possibly used to write the Old Nubian language of the successor Nubian kingdoms. Technology, Medicine and Mathematics Technology The natives of the Kingdom of Kush, developed the Sakia which was called Kolƒì in the Kingdom.The Sakia was developed during the Meroitic period to improve irrigation. The introduction of this machine had a decisive influence on agriculture especially in Dongola as this wheel lifted water 3 to 8 metres with much less expenditure of labour and time than the Shaduf, which was the previous chief irrigation device in the Kingdom. The Shaduf relied on human energy but the Sakia was driven by buffalos or other animals. The people of Kerma, ancestors to the Kushites, built bronze kilns through which they manufactured objects of daily use such as razors, mirrors and tweezers. The \\"Great Hafir\\" at Musawwarat es-Sufra. This artificial reservoir was built to retain the rainfall of the short, wet season. It is 250 m in diameter and 6.3 m deep. The Kushites invented reservoirs in the form of the Hafir, during the Meroitic period. 800 ancient and modern hafirs have been registered in the Meroitic town of Butana.Fritz Hintze, Kush XI; pp.222-224. The functions of Hafirs were to catch water during raining season for storage, in order to ensure water is available for several months during the dry season as well as supply drinking water, irrigate fields and water cattle. The Great Reservoir near the Lion Temple in Musawwarat es-Sufra is a notable hafir built by the Kushites. Bloomeries and blast furnaces could have been used in metalworking at Mero√´. Early records of bloomery furnaces dated at least to 7th and 6th century BC have been discovered in Kush. It is known that the ancient bloomeries that produced metal tools for the Kushites produced a surplus for sale. Medicine Nubian mummies studied in the 1990s revealed that Kush was a pioneer of early antibiotics. Tetracycline was being used by Nubians, based on bone remains between 350 AD and 550 AD. The antibiotic was in wide commercial use only in the mid 20th century. The theory states that earthen jars containing grain used for making beer contained the bacterium streptomycedes, which produced tetracycline. Although Nubians were not aware of tetracycline, they could have noticed that people fared better by drinking beer. According to Charlie Bamforth, a professor of biochemistry and brewing science at the University of California, Davis, he said \\"They must have consumed it because it was rather tastier than the grain from which it was derived. They would have noticed people fared better by consuming this product than they were just consuming the grain itself.\\"Roach, John. \\"Antibiotic Beer Gave Ancient Africans Health Buzz\\" , National Geographic News, 16 May 2005 Mathematics Based on engraved plans of Meroitic King Amanikhabali's pyramids, Nubians had a sophisticated understanding of mathematics as they appreciated the harmonic ratio. The engraved plans is indicative of much to be revealed about Nubian mathematics. The ancient Nubians also established a system of geometry which they used in creating early versions of sun clocks. During the Meroitic period in Nubian history, the Nubians used a trigonometric methodology similar to the Egyptians. Military During the siege of Hermopolis in the 8th century BC, siege towers were built for the Kushite army led by Piye, in order to enhance the efficiency of Kushite archers and slingers. After leaving Thebes, Piye's first objective was besieging Ashmunein. He gathered his army after their lack of success so far, and undertook the personal supervision of operations including the erection of a siege tower from which Kushite archers could fire down into the city. Early shelters protecting sappers armed with poles trying to breach mud-brick ramparts gave way to Battering rams Bowmen were the most important force components in Kushite military.Jim Hamm. 2000. The Traditional Bowyer's Bible, Volume 3, pp. 138-152 Ancient sources indicate that Kushite archers favored one-piece bows that were between six to seven feet long, with so powerful a draw strength that many of the archers user their feet to bend their bows. However, composite bows were also used in their arsenal. Greek historian, Herodotus indicated that primary bow construction was of seasoned palm wood, with arrows made of cane. Kushite arrows were often poisoned-tipped. Elephants were occasionally used in warfare during the Meroitic period as seen in the war against Rome around 20 BC.  Architecture  The pyramids of Meroe ‚Äì UNESCO World Heritage. During the Bronze age, Nubian ancestors of the Kingdom of Kush built speos between 3700 to 3250 BCE. This greatly influenced the architecture of the New kingdom. Tomb monuments were one of the more recognizable expressions of Kushite architecture. Uniquely Kushite tomb monuments were found from the beginning of the empire, at el Kurru, to the decline of the Kingdom. These monuments developed organically from Middle Nile (e.g. A-group) burial types. Tombs became progressively larger during the 25th dynasty, culminating in Taharqa's underground rectangular building with \\"aisles of square piers...the whole being cut from the living rock.\\" Kushites also created pyramids, mud brick temples (deffufa), and masonry temples. Kushites borrowed much from Egypt, as it relates to temple design. Kushite temples were quite diverse in their plans, except for the Amun temples which all have the same basic plan. The Jebel Barkal and Meroe Amun temples are exceptions with the 150m long Jebel Barkal being \\"by far the largest 'Egyptian' temple ever built in Nubia.\\" Temples for major Egyptian deities were built on \\"a system of internal harmonic proportions\\" based on \\"one or more rectangles each with sides in the ratio of 8:5\\" Kush also invented Nubian vaults. Piye is thought to have constructed the first true pyramid at el Kurru. Pyramids are \\"the archetypal tomb monument of the Kushite royal family\\" and found at \\"el Kurru, Nuri, Jebel Barkal, and Meroe.\\" The Kushite pyramids are smaller with steeper sides than northern egyptian pyramids. The Kushites are thought to have copied the pyramids of New Kingdom elites, as opposed to Old and Middle Kingdom pharaohs. Kushite housing is consisted mostly of circular timber huts with some apartment houses with a number of two room apartments. The apartments houses likely accommodated extended families. The Kushites built a stone paved road at Jebel Barkal, are thought to have built piers/harbors on the Nile river, and many wells.  Kush and Egyptology  On account of the Kingdom of Kush's proximity to Ancient Egypt ‚Äî the first cataract at Elephantine usually being considered the traditional border between the two polities ‚Äî and because the 25th dynasty ruled over both states in the 8th century BC, from the Rift Valley to the Taurus mountains, historians have closely associated the study of Kush with Egyptology, in keeping with the general assumption that the complex sociopolitical development of Egypt's neighbours can be understood in terms of Egyptian models. As a result, the political structure and organization of Kush as an independent ancient state has not received as thorough attention from scholars, and there remains much ambiguity especially surrounding the earliest periods of the state. Edwards has suggested that study of the region could benefit from increased recognition of Kush as a state in its own right, with distinct cultural conditions, rather than merely as a secondary state on the periphery of Egypt.

Dr. Marius Nygaard Smith-Petersen was the son of Morten Smith-Petersen and Kaia Jensine Rosalie Ursin, he was born on November 14, 1886 in the coastal town of Grimstad in Aust-Agder County, Norway. He died the 16th of June, 1953 in Boston, Massachusetts, at the age of 65, he died suddenly of a heart disorder, shortly after performing a successful hip replacement operation on one of his most famous patients, television, talk-show host, Arthur Godfrey. For many generations the Smith- Petersens were a prominent mercantile family in the cities of eastern Norway. His paternal, grandfather Morten Smith-Petersen (1817-1872) owned and operated a shipbuilding company where he built a great fleet of merchant sailing vessels from his shipyard known as Hasseldalen in Grimstad, Norway. Morten was also a member of Stortinget (Norwegian Parliament) and was known as a principal supporter of free trade and the establishment of \\"Norwegian Veritas\\". Marius' paternal grandmother was Katrinka von der Lippe (1824-1890) she was the daughter of Bishop Jacob von der Lippe, a member of Norwegian Parliament and the Bishop of Kristiansand, Norway. Maruis' father, also named Morten Smith-Petersen was considered a brilliant young lawyer with great promise, who in 1888 he died suddenly of pneumonia, when Marius was only two years old. His mother, Kaia was an accomplished violinist, trained by her father, Frederik Ursin a conductor and prominent violinist of Christiania, now Oslo, Norway. Kaia was playing trios with her father, and composer, pianist Edvard Grieg at the age of twelve. After the death of her husband Kaia moved from Grimstad to Oslo, Norway with her four sons, of whom Marius was the youngest. In 1903 at the age of sixteen, Marius and his mother, Kaia immigrated to the U.S. and settled in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. There he attended and was graduated from West Side High School in 1906. He then matriculated at the University of Chicago for one year, then transferred and graduated from the University of Wisconsin, receiving a B.S. in 1910. He worked as a laboratory assistant to Nobel Prize winner (1944) physiologist, Dr. Joseph Erlanger while attending the Medical School at the University of Wisconsin. Marius Smith-Petersen then transferred to Harvard Medical School in Cambridge, Massachusetts earning his degree in 1914. His general surgical internship was served at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston, MA under the pioneering neurosurgeon, Harvey Williams Cushing, M.D. The knowledge, skills and techniques he acquired from this association had a profound influence on his surgical career. He served in France during World War I with the First Harvard Medical Unit at the American Ambulance Hospital in Paris, France. His Orthopaedic foundation was laid under Dr. E. G. Brackett at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Dr. Smith-Petersen often called Mads by his friends went into private practice in Boston, Massachusetts in 1923. He served as Assistant Instructor in Orthopaedic Surgery at Harvard Medical School from 1920-1930, as Instructor in Orthopaedic Surgery at Harvard Medical School from 1930‚Äì1946, as Clinical Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery at Harvard Medical School from 1935-1946 and as Chief of Orthopaedic Service at Massachusetts General Hospital from 1929-1946 and as consultant to The Surgeon General from 1942-1945. He was internationally known for the development of the Smith- Petersen nail and hip nailing techniques and for hip-mold arthoplasty. He was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of St. Olav by the King of Norway. He was a brilliant surgeon and a gifted professor. He married Hilda Whitney Dickinson daughter of Charles P. Dickinson and Susan Cushing of Lunenburg, Massachusetts, they had four children and resided in Newton, Massachusetts.Books and journal publications lEvolution of Mould Arthroplasty of the Hip Joint (Lippincott-Raven Publishers) Career Smith-Petersen nail, 32 years after implantation From 1923 until his death in 1953 he carried on an active orthopedic surgery practice while successively serving as Instructor, Assistant Clinical Professor, and Clinical Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery at Harvard.

Plot introduction Adrian Monk temporarily moves in with his reluctant assistant, Natalie Teeger, while his home is being fumigated. Following this, her teenage daughter Julie \\"hires\\" him to investigate the death of Sparky, a popular firehouse guard dog who was struck with an axe on the same night that a suspicious house inferno was occupying its owners. Meanwhile, Natalie begins dating the animal's chief guardian, hunky fireman Joseph Cochran. Plot synopsis Adrian Monk, the obsessive-compulsive modern-day Sherlock Holmes, is forced to move in with his assistant Natalie Teeger, who is the narrator of the novel, while his apartment is being fumigated. After laying down certain laws (namely, turning away the moving men bringing Monk's refrigerator and bed into her house), Natalie finds her daughter Julie crying in her room. Julie tells her that Sparky, a firehouse dalmatian who visited her school during Fire Safety Week, was found murdered the previous night. Monk can't bear to see Julie cry, and promises to check into the matter. Monk and Natalie head down to Fire Station #28 in North Beach, Sparky's firehouse, to speak with Captain Mantooth, the commander of the engine company in question. Monk has a boyish fascination with firefighting ‚Äì that is, with the rules requiring everything in the firehouse to be spotlessly clean and in perfect order. While he is lovingly polishing the already shining ladder truck, Natalie questions Mantooth, who tells her that Sparky belonged to one of their best men, Joseph 'Joe' Cochran, and always slept in the firehouse while Joe was on duty. According to Mantooth, the crew was called to a multiple alarm house fire about four blocks from the firehouse around 10:00pm in which an old woman was killed, having fallen asleep while smoking a cigarette in front of her television set. Sometime in the four hours between when they left and when they returned, someone sneaked into the firehouse and killed Sparky with a pickaxe. Monk examines the crime scene, and he explains what he believe happened: the intruder walked into the firehouse through the open garage doors, probably looking for something to steal (although oddly, for a burglary, nothing seems to be missing), and grabbed a pickaxe off the rack when Sparky ran at him. Since the killer didn't bring the weapon, Monk guesses that the attack was probably spur-of-the-moment. The only question is who, or why, would someone kill a firehouse dog, and what was it the killer might have been looking for? When Monk asks Mantooth if anything was missing or disturbed when they got back, Mantooth says the only thing he noticed missing were two towels; he doesn't think it's important, but Monk is impressed to meet someone else who would notice that kind of detail. Monk and Natalie walk from the firehouse the five blocks to the scene of the previous night's fire, intending to look for Joe Cochran. Instead, they run into Captain Stottlemeyer, who is treating the house as a crime scene until the arson investigator makes a decision. Stottlemeyer and the arson investigator believe that the death was an accident: Esther Stoval, the victim, was a chain smoker. They believe that she was smoking a cigarette, which fell onto a pile of newspapers, igniting them. The fire spread from the newspapers to the rest of the room, and then to the rest of the house. However, Monk finds evidence that suggests that Esther was actually murdered: from the victim's position on the couch, she couldn't see the TV, and was looking at an empty chair, making it obvious that she was talking to someone else. Furthermore, if she was watching TV when she died, then why is the remote on the other end of the coffee table from where her head was? The conclusion is that someone killed Esther, then set her house on fire to destroy the evidence. Later that day, Monk and Natalie find Joe Cochran feeding the neighborhood's stray cats while the investigations wrap up. Monk refuses to approach the cats (due to allergies), so Natalie goes to talk with Joe, and sparks immediately fly ‚Äì Joe is not only ruggedly handsome, but big-hearted and courteous. When Natalie explains why they are there, Joe, a little choked up, says that everyone loved Sparky, and the only person with a motive he can think of would be Gregorio Dumas, a stuck-up dog breeder who lives across the street from the firehouse. Recently, Gregorio Dumas threatened the fire company with a lawsuit after Sparky impregnated his prize show poodle Letitia. Monk and Natalie talk to Dumas, who cuts a ludicrous figure with his palatial accommodations for his poodle, and his descriptions of Sparky as a common mutt. When Monk asks where he was the previous night, Dumas says he was at home on Friday night, watching the firehouse to make sure Sparky didn't try anything again. While watching, he saw a lone firefighter come out of the firehouse. When Natalie brings this up on a date with Joe later, Joe says that this is impossible: all of the on-duty firemen were at Esther Stoval's house that night and they never sent anyone back for supplies. Monk figures that perhaps Dumas saw the killer. In questioning Dumas, Monk also notices a strange detail: Dumas is so overprotective of his poodle that he keeps her in a locked kennel surrounded by barbed wire ‚Äì so how could Sparky have impregnated her? Before Monk can delve further on the firehouse dog case, he and Natalie are ordered back to the police station, where Stottlemeyer and Lieutenant Disher have received the autopsy report on Esther Stoval. A lack of any traces of smoke or soot particles in Esther's lungs or nasal passages confirms that Esther was dead before the fire was started, and she was apparently suffocated with a pillow. They have what Stottlemeyer calls a perfect murder: by then burning down the house, the killer was able to destroy all forensic evidence that would have otherwise existed, including usable fingerprints and DNA. On top of all that, there is not a single witness to the crime. Monk and Natalie ask around the neighborhood and they are dismayed to find that all of Esther's neighbors despised her: she was a stereotypical \\"mean old lady\\", who spied on the neighbors, complained loudly about their habits, and kept everyone up all night with the mewling of her innumerable cats. Worse, she was the lone holdout against a development plan by Lucas Breen, a local real estate tycoon, to demolish the houses on Esther's side of the street, and build an upscale condominium block. Now that she's dead, the other residents are delighted to take their buyout from Breen and vacate the neighborhood. Neighbors on both sides of Esther's street show similar stories - one of her next-door neighbors, who works at a local think tank, claims he had to research every new cat that Esther bought, and also mentions that Esther bought a type of cat known as a Turkish Van a few days before she was killed. He also notes that her house was like an enormous litterbox (as the dander would blow when it was windy out). A neighbor who lived across the street from Esther tells Monk and Natalie that Esther ratted him out to the cable company for hijacking their signal with an illegal converter box to watch a baseball game. He notes that he also sells antique cars to make some money (as he is unemployed), and when Esther saw people buying restored antique vehicles from him, she filed a complaint with the city clerk, who fined him for operating a business out of his house without first getting a license. Joe asks Natalie out on a date, and she accepts gladly; while picking her up, Joe also wins over Julie by giving her Sparky's firehouse badge and thanking her for caring enough about his dog to hire Monk. The next day, Monk, Natalie, and Stottlemeyer interview Lucas Breen, who is both rich and influential (he holds a seat on the police commission), and CEO of the Breen Development Corporation. Breen admits he didn't have a motive to kill Esther Stoval. In fact, for the record, if push ever came to shove, he could've always rewritten the zoning regulations on the block to evict her, or, if the worst came to happen, he could build his condo project around her house (Breen confides that it was only thanks to creativity that he was able to advance to the position he is currently at in the real estate industry). When Monk asks Breen for an alibi, Breen claims he was at a fundraiser at the Excelsior Tower Hotel downtown with his wife, the mayor, the governor and the governor's wife, and at least 500 other people. Leaving Breen's office, Stottlemeyer is exasperated that Monk had been needling Breen throughout the interview, and Monk says that he now believes Breen killed Esther Stoval. When Monk arrives down in the lobby, he walks into the lobby flower shop, buys a bouquet, and presents it to Natalie and Stottlemeyer, saying that without a doubt, it proves Breen killed Esther: it's a distinctive, handmade bouquet identical to one that Monk saw in the house of Lizzie Draper, one of the neighbors who lived across the street from Esther Stoval. Monk has learned that Breen bought a flower bouquet from the shop for Lizzie just a few days before Esther was killed. He's figured that Lizzie is Breen's mistress. Having remembered what Esther's other neighbors said about her spying habits, Monk figures that Esther had incriminating photos of Breen with Lizzie Draper, and she was blackmailing Breen, threatening to tell his wife, and he killed her to keep her quiet. Back at the police station, Randy confirms that Breen's alibi for that night is rock solid. When Stottlemeyer asks about the alibi, Monk dismisses it: the fundraiser was crowded enough that Breen could have slipped out, killed Esther, set the house on fire, and reappeared several hours later without anyone noticing he had gone. Moreover, Breen designed and built the Excelsior, so he would know how to slip out without being seen by the security cameras. However, the flowers aren't solid evidence, and with no witnesses who can confirm that Breen was in the house that night, and that Breen burned down the house to get rid of all traces of himself, they won't be able to easily arrest Breen, lest so much as indict him. But there is one question: how did Breen get to Esther's house? Natalie reasons that he couldn't have driven himself there because the press would have seen him leaving, and he probably wouldn't hail a taxi cab out of fear that the driver might remember him. Monk decides that Breen walked there. To see if it is possible, Monk and Natalie park at the hotel to recreate the timetable Breen would have had to work with. They find one service exit to a back alleyway that is blocked from view from the street by a number of dumpsters, and decide that Breen used this door to exit and put himself at a safe distance from the press. To time themselves, they take the most direct route, figuring that Breen did the same thing. As they are passing one office building, a homeless man asks for spare change, and Monk gives him several packages of wipes instead. The man is not pleased. After about 20 minutes walking, Monk and Natalie crest a hill and find themselves at Joe's firehouse. They decide to stop in and visit, reasoning that Breen would have had to stop around this point to catch his breath for a minute while on his way to Esther Stoval's house, even if he was on a tight schedule. While they are at the firehouse, Natalie asks Joe some more questions about Sparky's habits, and Joe says that Sparky was allowed to run loose around the neighborhood when they were out responding to 9-1-1 calls. He doesn't know where Sparky went while they were gone, but in the last few weeks, he always smelled like crap. Monk solves a piece of the case, and he and Natalie head across the street to confront Gregorio Dumas: it seems that Dumas has been tunneling into the basement of the firehouse, using the sewer line. He deliberately used his poodle to distract Sparky so he wouldn't bark, while Dumas searched the basement, which historical records show is where a famous 19th-century train robber stashed his hidden treasure. Now Monk realizes why Sparky always smelled. Dumas admits that he was in the firehouse on the night of the murder ‚Äì and that he used the two missing towels to wipe the sewage off his shoes ‚Äì but swears he didn't kill Sparky, as it would have broken his poodle's heart. He still mentions having seen the lone fireman leaving the garage, and in a way witnessed the crime. Monk believes him, and tells Natalie that Dumas saw Breen, who was posing as a fireman. Here's what happened Breen left the Excelsior and walked to Esther Stoval's house, having decided that he would try one more time to reason with her. He walked because that was the only way he could have made it there without being noticed (he couldn't drive himself because the valet and press would have seen him leave, and he couldn't take a taxi because the driver would have recognized him). When he got to Esther's house, she threatened to expose his affair with Lizzie Draper. He panicked, and quickly killed her, and then staged an \\"accidental\\" fire. He was running back to the hotel when he realized he had left something behind which would place him at her house that night. He couldn't take the chance that it would be destroyed in the fire or could be traced to him, but by the time he realized it, the engines from Joe's firehouse had already passed him and he couldn't go back inside. He sneaked into the firehouse, but Sparky came at him and Breen was forced to use a pickaxe to defend himself. He stole a helmet and turnout coat, and when he got back to the crime scene, he slipped on the gear. He was able to then retrieve the incriminating item without any bystanders or emergency workers noticing him, and then returned the stolen gear to the firehouse before returning to the fundraiser. As Monk and Natalie make their way back to the hotel, Monk explains to Natalie that he figured Breen had stolen a fireman's coat because when they first arrived at the firehouse, there was a coat facing the wrong way. The fire captain happens to have a system. As Natalie is asking Monk how they can prove that Breen was in Esther's house the night she was killed, she is almost mugged by a man with a knife, but she gets the better of him and Monk asks him whether he mugged anyone else in that area on the night of the fire. The mugger admits that he mugged Lucas Breen on the night in question and took Breen's wallet, and mentions that Breen reeked of smoke like he'd just fled from a fire. Monk, Natalie, and Stottlemeyer confront Breen at his office, but he denies everything. They inform him about how they know he was mugged as he was making his way back from the fire. Stottlemeyer notes that Breen did report his stolen credit cards to his bank, but wonders why Breen didn't call the police about the mugging. Breen claims he was mugged while he was out having a cigarette, and claims that he was smoking a cigar to explain what the mugger said about how Breen reeked of smoke. The next day, Monk quickly checks the weather patterns for that night and also examines \\"before\\" and \\"after\\" pictures of Breen at the fundraiser. He notices that in the \\"before\\" photo, Breen is wearing his monogrammed, tailor-made overcoat, but when in the \\"after\\" photo showing him leaving at midnight, the overcoat is gone. Monk explains what he thinks happened: according to one weather chart, it stopped raining at around 9:30 p.m. Joe's fire company was dispatched at 10:00 p.m. If it took 40 minutes for Breen to walk from the hotel to Esther's house, Breen's time of departure could be placed at around 9:15pm, so it would have still been raining when he first left. As a result, he wore his overcoat to stay dry. Monk figures that when he got to Esther's house, Breen must have hung his overcoat up and tried to reason with Esther, who threatened him with her incriminating images, and this provoked Breen into suffocating her. He then staged the fire and ran out of the house. Since the rain had stopped while he was en route to Esther's house, Breen forgot to take it when he left the house, and didn't realize his error until he'd travelled a few blocks, and was practically in front of the empty firehouse. He had to get that overcoat back, because ‚Äì if it were like the rest of his wardrobe ‚Äì it had monogrammed buttons with Breen's initials on them, and the buttons and scorched coat could have easily been traced back to him. Monk and Natalie go back to the firehouse. Natalie claims that they're going back to find where Breen may have ditched his overcoat, but Monk quickly figures that Natalie also wants to check on Joe, and points out the clues in her behavior that he noticed (she never stopped reading past a newspaper article on a warehouse fire the night before that hospitalized two firemen, and she kept checking the clock to see if it was a good time to call). They try to figure places where the coat could have been ditched. While Natalie suspects that Breen ditched it at Lizzie Draper's house, Monk points out that that would have been very risky, and he theorizes that Breen probably disposed of the coat somewhere between the firehouse and the hotel. During their search, Randy calls Natalie to tell them that the mugger has confirmed that Breen was wearing his overcoat when he was mugged. Monk and Natalie search several dumpsters on the route, but when all of the dumpsters turn up empty, Monk sadly concludes that it must have already been collected ‚Äì so the only way to find it is to root through the recently collected trash at the city dump. Monk and Natalie go to the garbage dump and talk to Chad Grimsley, the manager, requesting him to hold the trash from the Excelsior Hotel for a few days so they can search it. They plan to go to Stottlemeyer to get their search warrants, but are forced to meet him at a homicide investigation near Sutro Tower. Monk quickly solves the homicide Stottlemeyer is working on the spot, but Stottlemeyer informs Monk that getting a search warrant for all that garbage isn't something that a judge will be likely to issue. Unfortunately, the chief refuses to issue Stottlemeyer a search warrant, and orders him to stop harassing Breen with malicious accusations and start looking for other possible suspects. Stottlemeyer, however, still has faith in Monk's abilities as a detective, and as such knows that if Monk believes Breen is responsible for killing an old lady and a dog, he's probably right. So he decides to do the next-best thing he can do that will not get himself in trouble. Acting on Monk's theory that Breen stole a fireman's coat to get back into Esther's house, Stottlemeyer sends a forensics team to the firehouse to recover the firefighting gear that Breen might have utilized, as he believes that there is a chance that perhaps Breen left some fingerprints or DNA behind when he returned it. Randy points out that they don't know exactly which pieces of firefighting gear Breen wore that night, but Stottlemeyer admits that it is their only shot. The next date, Joe and several recruited off-duty firefighters pitch in to help Monk and Natalie root through the garbage, but without finding the overcoat. That night, Natalie goes on a second date with Joe, and they get even closer, though Natalie is disturbed by how nonchalantly Joe takes the dangerous aspects of his job. Their date is interrupted, however, when Stottlemeyer calls Monk and Natalie into a new homicide. A homeless man has been found bludgeoned to death with a brick in his encampment. According to the coroner, the man had been dead for two hours when he was discovered. Stottlemeyer notes that the cops are very lucky - a patrol car happened to be passing by and the officers saw the mass commotion that coincided with the body's discovery. Monk has a sneezing fit, noting that the man seems to have slept with cats. When he asks why he is here, Stottlemeyer shows him several packets of wipes in the dead man's pockets, and asks if they knew each other. Natalie recognizes the dead man as one of the homeless men that Monk handed wipes to while they were retracing Breen's steps. Monk realizes that, despite the freezing cold temperatures, the dead man has no coat, and when he ran into the man on the street, he was wearing a dirty and tattered overcoat. He immediately announces that Breen also killed the homeless man. Stottlemeyer is skeptical, noting that Monk is making Breen into a type of serial killer, but Monk thinks that Breen is just a man who has to keep killing just to get away with killing Esther Stoval. He explains where the homeless man fits in: after recovering his overcoat and returning the stolen firefighting gear to the firehouse, Breen walked back to the hotel, during which time he was mugged. Afterwards, before he returned to the hotel, Breen put his overcoat in one of the Excelsior's dumpsters (probably because it had been partially scorched in the fire, and hence was ruined; also, he would have had to explain to his wife and others how he was able to scorch his overcoat during the fundraiser). Later that night, the now-deceased homeless man picked it up. He didn't know about its origins, but when Monk, Natalie and Stottlemeyer were confronting Breen with their murder accusations, Breen saw the homeless man outside, and recognized the coat. Seeing the one piece of evidence that could send him to death row passing his building, Breen tracked the homeless man down, killed him, and then stole his overcoat. The three race to Breen's house to try and recover the coat, but they are too late: Breen has incinerated the overcoat in his fireplace, and (while sniffling due to a bad cold) smugly informs them that they have no evidence left to connect him with any crime. Monk trudges back to Natalie's house, feeling defeated. He is made more frustrated that Stottlemeyer risks losing his badge because of this case, and this is a case where Stottlemeyer got dragged into the investigation. Monk flips through his favorite book of Marmaduke cartoons, and when he spots a Marmaduke cartoon in which Marmaduke chases a cat up a tree, he realizes that they still have a chance to arrest Breen. He explains his theory to Stottlemeyer, who is willing to bet on it, even though he knows that this is risky. He points out that the chief just reprimanded him that morning for what he has done, and he risks losing his badge or possibly even demotion. Randy offers to come along, but Stottlemeyer says he won't risk Randy's badge along with his own. Stottlemeyer and Natalie confront Breen in his penthouse office, while Monk remains in the lobby. Monk calls up on a cell phone, and on cue, Natalie produces a white cat. Breen starts to sneeze, and Monk reveals his ace in the hole: Breen was sneezing explosively when they confronted him at his house. He claimed to have a cold, but Monk has just proven that he and Breen have one thing in common: they're both allergic to cats! The cat Natalie is carrying is one that Esther Stoval purchased just a few days before she was killed. Monk also remembers that he had a sneezing fit when he first met the homeless man who was later killed, and later had a similar fit when he was at the dead man's encampment. He initially thought that the man lived with cats, but there were no cat litters anywhere near the encampment. Now he realizes that cat dander collected on Breen's overcoat during the fire. Stottlemeyer reveals that they're already searching Breen's car and house they are going to match the danders they find to Esther's cats. Breen cracks and makes a run for it, escaping the office in a private elevator. Stottlemeyer curses, knowing that if Breen manages to get out of the building he will disappear forever. However, Monk has a plan. As Breen is about to drive out of the parking garage, Monk grabs two bowls of clam chowder from the lobby restaurant and throws them at Breen's windshield, blinding him, and causing him to lose control and crash. Breen, severely injured, and having lost several of his teeth in the crash, stumbles out of his car carrying a gun, wanting nothing more than to kill Monk before he goes to prison. Before Breen can pull the trigger, Randy suddenly appears and shoots the gun out of his hand. When Stottlemeyer and Natalie arrive downstairs, Randy tells them that he followed them because he thought they would need backup, though Stottlemeyer points out to him that he also violated a direct order. Returning to the police station, Monk, Natalie, Stottlemeyer and Disher learn that the preliminary on the hairs found in both Breen's house and car have matched with Esther's cats. Stottlemeyer mentions that his review hearing has been suspended and has been replaced with a commendation event for Randy. Satisfied, Monk and Natalie return to the firehouse to inform the crews that they have caught Sparky's killer. Joe is ecstatic and wants to take Natalie out to celebrate, but Natalie says she's come to a difficult decision: she is falling for Joe, but can't get involved with another man in a dangerous job; she and Julie already lost Mitch, and she can't go through that again. Joe is crestfallen, but accepts her decision. Julie is so grateful to Monk for finding Sparky's killer that she organizes her bedroom just as he would like it. While Monk is preparing to move back home, Stottlemeyer drops by to tell them that the Breen case has been clinched by the amount of incriminating evidence they've been able to locate. They don't only have him just with the cat dander, but forensics has found Breen's fingerprints in a firefighter's glove. Before Stottlemeyer leaves, Monk casually asks him to arrest Mrs. Throphamner, Natalie's elderly next-door neighbor who has been babysitting Julie. He says that she murdered her husband ‚Äì she's been wearing his dentures in place of her own, and constantly planting and re-planting her roses to conceal his decaying corpse buried in her garden. To Natalie's astonishment, the neighbor confesses. Furious that Monk would let her leave Julie in the care of a murderess, on the assumption that she wouldn't kill anyone else, Natalie stalks off, not trusting herself near Monk for a good week.

It was loosely adapted from the novel Mr. Monk Goes to the Firehouse. This episode was listed as one of Ted Levine's favorites during the Monk Cast Favorites Marathon. Fire Station 1 of the Los Angeles City Fire Department was used for filming the scenes set in the fictitious SFFD Engine Company #53 Plot synopsis Early one afternoon at Fire Company #53 of the San Francisco Fire Department, Rusty (Art Evans), a veteran firefighter, delivers lunch to his colleagues and then criticizes one crewman who cracks a dry joke. The fire captain (Rocky McMurray), reassures Rusty that they all admire him, but is interrupted when Monk arrives carrying a container full of smoke detectors. Barely has Monk arrived when the station's two-tone call alarm goes off. A fire has broken out at a house just five blocks away from the firehouse. Despite Monk's protests, the crew jump onto the engine, and Monk can only watch as the fire engine drives away, sirens wailing. Rusty tests Monk's smoke detectors one at a time by blowing puffs of cigarette smoke into them, and is surprised to find that Monk is overly cautious, having 30 smoke detectors for the five rooms, two hallways, and vestibule that make up his apartment. They are interrupted when they hear a squeaking noise. Monk and Rusty look up as a man, Eddie Murdoch (Drew Powell), enters the garage. Acting like he is trying not to be noticed, Murdoch walks around the cab of the spare fire engine parked in the garage. Rusty walks around the back of the truck to confront Murdoch. Murdoch promptly grabs a shovel from the tool rack and delivers the luckless Rusty a fatal strike to the head. Monk hears an audible clang. He rushes over to investigate and is promptly attacked by Murdoch with the shovel. After a short struggle, Monk manages to grab the shovel. But as he is about to take a swing, Murdoch grabs a container of cleaning fluid and throws the contents into Monk's face. Monk staggers back against the truck, screaming in agonizing pain, and collapses. A short time later, Natalie arrives looking for Monk. Hearing Monk still groaning, she rushes back behind the fire engine and finds him rubbing his eyes. As she helps Monk to his feet, she calls for help and instructs Monk to find a chair to sit down in. But it is apparent that Monk is blind. Monk is rushed to the hospital to be examined. The doctor tells Stottlemeyer and Disher that the solvent that the attacker threw into Monk's face was composed of detergent and muriatic acid, causing severe optic nerve damage. Whether or not Monk's eyesight will come back is unclear at this point in time. Randy tries to reassure Monk that he and Stottlemeyer are doing everything they can to find the attacker, but Stottlemeyer cuts him off when he realizes that Randy is only making the crisis worse. Monk is very crippled at the loss of his vision, despite Natalie telling him that there's always hope. At the police station, a School for the Blind teacher puts Stottlemeyer and Disher through an empathy exercise to teach them what Monk is dealing with (Stottlemeyer admits that he feels hopeless and Randy admits to feeling disoriented). Wearing blindfolds, they are told to stand up from the couch in Stottlemeyer's office, make their way to the water cooler on the other side of the squad room, and then pour themselves a paper cup of water. Randy does this rather clumsily, bumping into detectives' desks twice and knocking things over, while Stottlemeyer feels around with the palms of his hands and tries to reassure one detective that everything is under control. At the conclusion of the exercise, Stottlemeyer confides to the teacher that her advice is useless for a guy with Monk's personality, having known him for much longer than her. He expresses personal doubt that Monk will be able to function, given Monk's fragile condition. The teacher tells Stottlemeyer that it's up to him to make Monk function properly, getting him back to investigating. Stottlemeyer appears skeptical. At his apartment, Monk has become quite upset at the fact that he might never see his pictures of Trudy again. Natalie convinces Monk to continue investigating, since Monk may not have sight but he does have the senses of smell, sound, touch and taste to rely upon. She tries to use examples of people who did great things while blind, like Mr. Magoo and blind singer Ray Charles, as role models that Monk can follow. Midway through, Stottlemeyer shows up and asks Monk to accompany him down to the firehouse. Monk is unwilling to come along, pointing out that he gave Randy a detailed statement of what happened during the attack. Stottlemeyer gets Monk on his feet by reminding him that he can't make his condition a personal matter because Rusty was killed, making Monk the sole eyewitness in a homicide investigation. Monk is brought back to the firehouse. After making a few mistakes with trying to locate items in the garage, Natalie suggests to Monk that he use his photographic memory to recreate the room as it was when he was attacked. Once they sit Monk down at the chair he was sitting in when Murdoch entered, it becomes easier for them to walk Monk back through his statement. Randy notes that according to his story, his attacker was 6'1\\", heavyset, with sandy hair, and was wearing a leather motorcycle jacket. He also reeked of rum, like he had been drinking. After Monk gets tangled up in the crime scene tape stretched between the wall and the fire engine's back bumper, Natalie walks him back towards the street. As he is leaving, Monk brushes his shoulder against a rack of firefighting protective coats, and suddenly stops. He immediately realizes that there were six coats on the rack before the attack, but there is one missing. The fire captain takes notice and agrees with Monk's observation. The obvious conclusion is that the killer stole it. Some days later, Monk is later being assisted by a walking cane. He and Natalie arrive at the police station, where Stottlemeyer and Disher have brought in a potential suspect - a drifter named Jake Colbert. According to Stottlemeyer, Colbert has no alibi, is the correct height, and was found wearing the missing firefighter's coat. As Monk has no eyesight, he cannot identify Colbert as the guy through a regular lineup. Furthermore, Colbert swears that he found the coat in a Tenderloin dumpster. Monk is told that he must feel Colbert's face to identify him, and he does so, reluctantly at first. When Monk does so, he finds a wart on Colbert's chin, and he is certain that Colbert is not the killer, even though he was found wearing the fireman's coat when he was picked up. Later, Monk, Natalie, Stottlemeyer and Disher travel to the alley where Colbert found the jacket. Reading from his notebook, Randy mentions that Colbert's story checks out. He claimed that he was in the alleyway that afternoon collecting bottles and cans and found the missing coat in a dumpster. He also found a firefighter's helmet which he gave to a couple of passing children. Monk is skeptical: Colbert found the coat at 5:00pm, and Rusty was killed at around two o'clock, so why would someone be determined enough to attack two people to steal firefighting gear, but toss it away within a few hours? While they are in the alleyway, Monk is overly delighted to find that he can't see the alley's low-life inhabitants, including a pair of rats scrounging around in the garbage cans, the cockroaches, or even a dead cat, and actually for once sees the positives of being blind. Stottlemeyer puts the lid on a garbage can to hide a pair of scrounging rats, and he admits that they are in the same neighborhood as the house fire that the fire crew was responding to when Monk was attacked. He notes that the young woman who lived there was killed in the fire, after she fell asleep smoking a cigarette in front of the TV. Monk, however, realizes that there might be something about the fire that's connected to the attack at the firehouse. Monk, Natalie, Stottlemeyer and Disher travel to the burned out remains of the house. Monk feels his way around the bathroom (not caring at all about the fact that he is getting soot all over his hands), and then makes his way to the living room. Stottlemeyer notes that the fire was started when the victim fell asleep and a lit cigarette ignited a pile of old newspapers. The victim was a 27-year-old woman named Stefanie Preston. She had been working as a temp for Peter Breen Construction, a local construction company, for the past eight weeks. Although the file says that Stefanie lived alone, Monk finds evidence of a boyfriend: the presence of men's cologne in the bathroom, as well as the presence of two toothbrushes, and two different toothpaste tubes. In the living room, Monk picks up a scorched bottle on a table and notes that it smells of rum, and he remembers that his attacker reeked of rum. He also finds the impression of a rearing horse etched into the glass on the coffee table, next to a gob of melted plastic that used to be the TV remote, and realizes that something doesn't make sense: if Stefanie was \\"watching\\" TV, then why is the remote at the opposite end of the table from where her upper body would have been? With this, he realizes what the firehouse attack was about. =Here's What Happened= Murdoch strangled Stefanie, made it look like she'd fallen asleep on the couch, then started the fire by throwing a lit cigarette onto a pile of newspapers. As he was walking away, he must have stopped and realized he forgot something in the house, probably something metallic that could survive the fire and be traced back to him if the police ever found it. Murdoch could not simply go back to the crime scene to retrieve the object, however, because he'd made his realization just as a fire engine sped past him while responding to the fire. To gain access to the scene, he needed a firefighter's coat and helmet, so Murdoch went to the firehouse. After killing Rusty and blinding Monk, Murdoch grabbed a coat and helmet, and returned to the burning house. Murdoch looked like one of the real firemen, so in the chaos, none of the cops or real firefighters on the scene noticed him or questioned him as he slipped under the tape, walked right into the house, and retrieved the incriminating object. Monk is elated, realizing that, even without his sight, he's still a great detective. In session with Dr. Kroger, Monk tells him that he feels liberated - losing his sight has halved the number of his fears, and he has a whole new life to \\"look\\" forward to. Troubled, Dr. Kroger thinks he's still in denial over his loss. Monk, Natalie, Stottlemeyer and Disher visit a construction site to interview Peter Breen (Jamie Kaler), Stefanie Preston's boss. Breen suggests that Monk wait in the construction trailer, but Monk insists on being treated like everyone else. As Natalie guides Monk along, she has to stop him from touching some coils of barbed wire. Although busy issuing instructions to workers, Breen admits that he knew Stefanie intermittently, and he hired her because his regular girl was on maternity leave. He also claims that he's never been to Stefanie Preston's house. When asked to supply an alibi for the approximate time of Stefanie's and Rusty's deaths, Breen claims he was on-site talking with some of his employees. Randy notices and takes an interest in Breen's Ferrari sports car. During their conversation, Eddie Murdoch comes up to Breen, and reassures Breen that he still has his keys. Breen tells Murdoch that they'll take care of that matter later. Monk hears a squeaking noise from the treads of Murdoch's shoes, and he recognizes the squeak as being the same consistency as that of the one he heard when Rusty was attacked. Monk takes off after Murdoch, but Natalie, Stottlemeyer and Disher do not see him leaving. Monk catches up to Murdoch in another room, and quickly feels Murdoch's face, identifying him as the killer. Murdoch prepares to kill Monk to eliminate the sole witness to Rusty's death, using a saw, but Monk whips him several times with his cane and then hurls several objects at him, overpowering Murdoch long enough for Monk to steal his nametag and escape. Murdoch recovers, and chases after Monk, but by hiding behind a wall, Monk is narrowly able to throw Murdoch off course. Murdoch goes running up the stairs, thinking that he'll find Monk up there. After briefly getting lost, Monk stumbles into an out-of-order construction elevator, and tries to start it up. It shudders, only getting a few inches up, causing him to mistakenly believe that he has ridden it up to the top level of the construction site, and is balancing precariously on a girder high in the air (which is in fact sitting on the ground). He learns the truth when Natalie, Stottlemeyer and Disher rush in and find him (\\"Natalie, are you... flying?\\"). Monk quickly hands Randy the nametag he snatched from Murdoch. No sooner has Randy read Murdoch's name when there is a scream as Murdoch falls down a shaft to his death. Stottlemeyer and Disher identify him, and Randy suggests that Murdoch slipped while trying to escape. Back at the hospital, Monk is examined again, and the doctor is cautiously optimistic, saying that Monk's eyesight is returning gradually. Monk, however, has lost all his former optimism after the humiliation of screaming for help while standing on a steel beam ten inches off the ground, and believes that there might be a chance that his eyesight might not return. Randy assures Monk that indeed, Eddie Murdoch is the person who killed Stefanie Preston and Rusty - they found soot-stained clothes in his house. Natalie and Randy then leave the hospital, leaving Stottlemeyer with Monk. Monk is having second thoughts about the case: Eddie Murdoch definitely killed Stefanie Preston and Rusty, but what was his motive? Monk remembers how when they were talking to Peter Breen, Murdoch walked up and he said to Breen, \\"I still have those keys.\\" He realizes that Murdoch may have been talking about the keys to Breen's Ferrari. Monk asks Stottlemeyer what the keychains to Ferraris like Breen's look like, and Stottlemeyer confirms that they are shaped like a rearing horse. They suddenly realize that the rearing-horse impression left on the coffee table at Stefanie's house during the fire came from Peter Breen's keys. Monk and Stottlemeyer rush down to the morgue in search of the keys. Monk explains his theory. He explains that while Eddie Murdoch killed Stefanie Preston and Rusty, and he was the man that attacked Monk at the firehouse, none of it was his idea: he was hired by Breen as a hitman to carry out the job. Breen was the one having the affair; he had keys to Stefanie's house, which he loaned to Murdoch so that Murdoch could kill her and then stage an \\"accidental\\" fire. It was all because of the house keys that Murdoch went to the firehouse to steal firefighting gear to reenter the scene of the fire. Monk and Stottlemeyer eventually locate Murdoch's body. They find the keys they are looking for in a plastic bag containing Murdoch's personal effects. Just as Stottlemeyer grabs the keys and tells Monk that they've found Exhibit A, one of the \\"corpses\\" rises from its gurney and casts off the sheet. It is Peter Breen, who has followed Eddie Murdoch's body to the morgue to recover his keys and destroy the one remaining piece of evidence against him. Breen knocks Stottlemeyer out, and then handcuffs him to a gurney, then grabs a knife to prepare to kill Monk. He also manages to take Monk's cane. Monk grabs Stottlemeyer's pistol, and with his eyesight beginning to return just in the nick of time, shoots Breen in the chest, then leans down to check on Stottlemeyer, who realizes that Monk can see him. A few nights later, Monk, having made a full recovery, is reading in his armchair, glancing up to admire his many pictures of Trudy on the wall. Additional facts *During the scene where Natalie is trying to keep Monk's hopes up at his apartment, she mentions that there have been a lot of blind people who have done amazing things. To prove her point, Natalie mentions Mr. Magoo, an animated cartoon character, and an amazing blind inventor, who appeared in a series of short films. She also makes a mention to American musician Ray Charles, who was blind by the time he was seven years old due to glaucoma. Ray Charles died in 2004, two years before \\"Mr. Monk Can't See a Thing\\" was produced. *When Monk is getting soot on his hands while searching Stefanie Preston's house, Stottlemeyer asks him if he wants some gloves, but Monk declines, saying, \\"No, don't need them. Out of sight, out of mind.\\" By coincidence, \\"Out of Sight, Out of Mind\\" was an episode of the TV series M*A*S*H in which Hawkeye Pierce was temporarily blinded. The plots of both \\"Mr. Monk Can't See a Thing\\" and \\"Out of Sight, Out of Mind\\" are very similar. In both, the main character is initially despondent at the chance that their loss of eyesight might be permanent, and in both, the protagonist becomes fascinated with his other senses due to sensory deprivation. And in both, the sense of smell to find clues proves to be crucial. There are, however, a number of differences (Hawkeye loses his eyesight when a malfunctioning stove explodes, whereas Monk loses his when he is attacked during a robbery). *The alarm at Fire Company 53 (two short tones followed by a buzzer) is the same alarm that is used at LACFD Fire Company 51 in Emergency!. *The original version of \\"Mr. Monk Can't See a Thing\\" had scenes in which actor Ron Rogge would have portrayed a welder. His scenes were deleted from the final version.\\"Monk\\" Mr. Monk Can't See a Thing (2006) - Full Cast and Crew *When Monk, Natalie, Stottlemeyer, and Disher are in the alleyway where Jake Colbert said he found the fireman's coat stolen from Fire Company 53, a prostitute can be seen standing in the background behind Monk (not that she is bothering Monk, because he can't see her, nor can he see the cockroaches and dead cat in the alley). *At least two characters in \\"Mr. Monk Can't See a Thing\\" got their names from actual people on the production staff for Monk. The teacher from the School for the Blind is named Shana, and is portrayed by Shana Stein, and fire victim Stefanie Preston gets her name from a person of the same name on the production staff.

In 1947, he took a gap year after secondary school to work at the Commonwealth Mycological Institute in Kew. His undergraduate studies was at Imperial College London, graduating with first class honours in botany at the age of 20 and won the Forbes Memorial Medal and Prize in Biology. M. F. Madelin continued his graduate studies at the same institution under the supervision of the pioneer British plant pathologist, R. K. S. Wood, and earned his PhD in mycology in 1954. Between 1955 and 1957, Michael Madelin did his national service as a flight lieutenant in the Royal Air Force.  Career  He became a lecturer at the University College of the Gold Coast, then part of the University of London external system, where he researched tropical fungal parasites in insects and developed a lifelong interest in the subject. Moving back to Imperial College, he taught courses in plant pathology before accepting a mycology research- lectureship at the University of Bristol in 1962. For his groundbreaking research conducted at Imperial College, he received the Huxley Memorial Medal and Prize in 1967. He taught a popular course, Medicine and Mycology, to medical students at Cambridge. He also carried out various academic assignments at the universities of Bath, Hull and Exeter. Madelin was a visiting researcher at several institutions abroad in Chennai, India; Suva, Fiji and Madrid, Spain. He was the co-convener of the First International Fungus Spore Symposium which took place in Bristol in 1965. He was influential in other international meetings in mycology, particularly those held in Kananaskis, Alberta; Gwatt, Switzerland; Exeter, UK and Berkeley, California. He served in various capacities at the British Mycological Society as the Programme Secretary, Vice-President, and President. M. F. Madelin co-edited the Journal of General Microbiology, now named Microbiology, for six years in the early 1970s. He was the doctoral advisor of the pioneering Ghanaian plant pathologist, George C. Clerk (1931‚Äì2019). He also collaborated with the Indian botanist, C. V. Subramanian. He retired from Bristol in 1991 and relocated to Oxford. He then devoted himself to popular science, teaching fungi at the university and through broadcast journalism on television and radio.  Personal life  He was married to Therese and they had five children.  Final years and death  Later in life, M. F. Madelin was diagnosed with Lewy body dementia and Parkinson's disease. He died in Oxford in 2007, aged 76. His remains were buried at the Wolvercote Cemetery.  Works  The following are scientific publications of Michael Francis Madelin: * M. F.

He taught the history of economic thought in the departments of political science at the University of Pisa, the University of Teramo, and Sapienza University of Rome, always as an associate professor, as he was never awarded tenure. He penned over 200 academic publications between 1957 and 2008, focusing his studies on the birth of Italian economic thought. A practicing Roman Catholic, he opposed Max Weber's thesis, arguing that the root of market capitalism is not to be found in the Protestant Reformation but in the reaction by lawyers and humanists to the framing of economic issues under scholasticism. This thesis is developed in particular in his 1999 work Goodbye Protestant Ethics. His most important work was Italian Economic Thought, a three-volume, seven-book work which covered the eleventh to the eighteenth centuries and won the Saint-Vincent Prize for the Economy in 1985. The work was summarized in the 700 pages of A History of Italian Economic Thought (As a Genesis of the Capitalist Spirit), published posthumously in 2008 by the LUISS University Press (Rome) and also available in English. In 1987 the study Economic Epistemology: the role of the concepts of 'nature' and 'natural law' in the genesis of the economic won the \\"Seventy- fifth Prize\\" awarded by the Review of Economic Policy. Nuccio followed that major work in 2000 with the study False and Commonplace in History: the equation of the Protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism, published by Alberti (Florence).

Biography Born on July 11, 1898, Lassa was Native American and a member of the Blackfoot tribe, however some sources have him listed as a Cherokee or a Flathead. He was given the name, Long Time Sleep, by his teammates because he was so hard to wake up in the morning. Lassa attended and played college football at the Carlisle Indian School and Haskell Indian Nations University. Lassa eventually played in the National Football League in 1922 with the Oorang Indians. The Oorang Indians were an all-Native American football team based in La Rue, Ohio and formed by Walter Lingo in 1922 to help promote his Airedale kennel. The team was organized by Jim Thorpe, who served the team as a player-coach. When the team formed, Lassa was the first player to arrive in La Rue. Aside from football, Lassa enjoyed wrestling. He would make up to $50.00 for wrestling matches throughout the area. In fact he is most remembered for wrestling a bear as part of a halftime show of one of the Indians' games. Lassa would usually win between 10-20 dollars per match and that money would allow the whole team to go out partying all night. After the team folded in 1923, Lassa stayed near LaRue, earning his living as a professional wrestler and strongman. He also stayed on working for Lingo and several of the other farmers in the area. He finally left the area in the early 1930s. He reportedly gave up drinking, raised a family, and became a respected member of his community. Lassa died on September 4, 1964.

The complex is especially known by the temple of Wat Nokor in Khum of Kompong Siem, 1200 meters from the town of Kompong Cham. The local people sometimes call it 'Wat Angkor' though a sign at the entrance now officially designates the name of the temple as Wat Nokor Bachey.  History  The monument was built out of sandstone and laterite, and dates from the last years of the reign of Jayavarman VII. It is composed of a central tower surrounded by four laterite wall enclosures. The central tower of the temple of Vat Nokor is decorated with motifs characteristic of Bayon with Buddhist scenes on the pediments.Ensemble de Banteay Prei Nokor - UNESCO World Heritage Centre The temple complex is believed to have been the headquarters of Jayavarman VII for a time, from where he extended his influence over nearby principalities.O'Reilly, D.J.W (2006), Early Civilizations of Southeast Asia, Rowman Altamira. It has a number of distinguishing characteristics other than the fact that it is the largest ancient temple complex in Kampong Cham Province. One of these characteristics alludes to the fact that it is built of black sandstone, which causes it to stand out from other temples of the period which are often built of brick or reddish sandstone. The temple has an inscription which is open to visitors to see (and even touch) in the central pavilion. Wat Nokor Bache boasts a 'Chartres' effect in which a more modern temple of a very different style has been built over and around the original Angkorian structure creating a blend of architectural styles. There are many legends surrounding the origin of the temple but the most popular one has Oedipal overtones. According to this legend, the temple was built by a king who accidentally killed his father and married his mother. As recounted in the Greek legend, this king was put out by his father after a seer told him that his son would kill him. The son, however, did not die and returned to his kingdom not knowing that his father was the king. After quarreling on the road, the son killed the king and married his queen who was his mother. Upon discovering his crime, the young man built Wat Nokor in penance for his crime. Visiting Wat Nokor does not get the attention or maintenance necessary to maintain the grounds and gardens.

Its deserted ambiance is one of its greatest attractions and distinguishes it from the tourist atmosphere found in Siem Reap and other popular locations.

She is operated by the Ottawa-based youth charity, Bytown Brigantine Inc. Fair Jeanne is a traditionally-rigged brigantine of composite construction, outfitted with a Detroit Diesel auxiliary propulsion system. Fair Jeanne sails mostly on the Great Lakes, particularly Lake Ontario, and is berthed in Kingston, Ontario during the summer months. While Fair Jeannes summer port is Kingston, she was built by the Fuller family in the backyard of their Ottawa home. Fair Jeanne began life as the family's private yacht, cruising the world's oceans for more than ten years. Fair Jeanne is leased to the not-for-profit youth charity Bytown Brigantine, which uses her and her sister ship for youth sail training. In addition to summer youth voyages, Fair Jeanne also does fall and spring group trips for organizations such as the Royal Canadian Sea Cadets, Girl Guides of Canada and corporate groups. Fair Jeanne also offers trips for people who are working towards The Duke of Edinburgh's Awards. The length overall of the ship is , length on deck , and length at the waterline . The beam width of the ship is . The mast height is carrying approximately of sail. Her hull is constructed of a steel frame with a thick fiber glass overlay. She draws , or with the centreboard down, which allows her access to shallow docks. History Fair Jeanne began her life in the backyard of the former Royal Canadian Navy officer Thomas G. Fuller. She was designed and built by Captain Fuller at his home in Britannia-on-the-Bay in Ottawa, Ontario. The keel was laid in 1978 and she was launched in 1980. Fair Jeanne was sailed by Capt. Fuller and his wife, Jeanne (now patron of Bytown Brigantine Inc.) in the Caribbean and to his old haunts in the European seas. During the past 15 years, the ship has logged over in service. The Fuller family founded Bytown Brigantine Foundation in 1984 utilizing Fair Jeannes sister ship, , whose port is the Britannia Yacht Club. After 14 years of service to the family as a yacht, Fair Jeanne was brought into sail-training service as well, allowing Bytown Brigantine Inc. to expand its program and offer offshore sail training for youth between the ages of 15‚Äì18.Bytown Brigantine Fair Jeanne Fair Jeanne took part in the Tall Ships 1812 Tour, a pan-provincial event that traveled throughout Ontario during the summer of 2013, commemorating the bicentennial for the War of 1812. Sixteen ports participated in this event which was produced in partnership with the Tall Ships Challenge Great Lakes 2013 series. The first port of call for the tour was in Brockville, Ontario, Canada from June 14‚Äì16, 2013. On the morning of July 26, 2013 Fair Jeanne was struck by a fishing tug while at anchor near Port Stanley, Ontario. The impact left a hole in the hull, approximately above the water line.

PacRim holds a state lease to of Alaska Mental Health Trust property where an estimated 1 billion metric tons of low-sulfur, sub-bituminous coal is thought to exist.Chuitna Coal Project SEIS Site Proven reserves are reported to be 771 million tons.Alaska Mineral Industry 2007 Summary , page 11 The company is in the advanced stages of state and federal mine-permitting processes.Alaska Department of Natural Resources, Division of Mining, Land & Water PacRim has surveyed three Logical Mining Units, or LMUs, within its lease. If permitted, the company has said it plans to extract up to 12 million metric tons of coal from the first of these units over a minimum period of 25 years. Other LMUs, could be developed in future years. The surface coalmine itself could eventually spread to cover , but the project also would include assorted support facilities, a mine road and a long, covered conveyor system to transport coal to Cook Inlet at Ladd Landing where a port facility would be built. Ladd Landing is property owned by the Kenai Peninsula Borough and subject to a lease-option held by PacRim.Option to Lease Ladd Landing A letter of intent to exercise the Ladd Landing option was filed by PacRim in March, 2009. For more, see Lease-Option History section below. Only about 10 percent of Alaska's electricity is generated by coal, all of which is produced by the Usibelli Coal Mine, near Healy, Alaska. That operation supplies six Interior Alaska power plants and ships its surplus overseas.Usibelli Coal Mine Inc. Currently, Alaska's coal-fired generating capacity has no need for the coal that would be produced at Chuitna. Thus, coal extracted from the Chuitna project would most likely be shipped to Asian markets, including South Korea, Japan and Mainland China, with other possible markets being Mexico and Chile. Interest in exploiting the resources in the Beluga Coal Fields has waxed and waned over the decades since the late 1960s, with the lease passing through a succession of corporate hands. The proposed Chuitna Coal Project has both proponents and opponents and is becoming increasingly controversial in the Cook Inlet region. Geography The proposed Chuitna Coal Project mine site is located within PacRim's lease area designated as follows: Sec 14, 15, 21-28 and 33-36, T13N, R12W, Seward Meridian.2006 Revision to PacRim's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit application Land ownership Land within and around PacRim's lease area is owned by a variety of entities, including the State of Alaska, the Alaska Mental Health Trust Authority,Alaska Mental Health Trust Authority the Kenai Peninsula Borough, the Tyonek Native Corp.,[See Alaska Native Regional Corporations wikipedia] Cook Inlet Region, Inc. (CIRI), and private owners. The state of Alaska owns about (including mental health lands), and coal leases have been issued on some , including the leased to PacRim. Two state wildlife refuges are near the project zone. They are the Susitna Flats Wildlife Refuge to the northeast, and the Trading Bay Wildlife Refuge to the southwest. According to the state, neither would be affected by the mining project. Tyonek Native Corp. owns more than to the southeast. CIRI owns a scattering of properties around the mine site. The Kenai Peninsula Borough owns south of the mine lease boundary and a small area of land around Beluga and Ladd Landing. Private land is mostly along the Cook Inlet coastline in Beluga, Tyonek, as well as at North Forelands and south of Granite Point, which are coastal locations south of Tyonek.Land Use Baseline Summary Report for Chuitna Coal Project Lease-option history The Kenai Peninsula Borough-PacRim Ladd Landing lease-option document shows that in 1987, the borough entered a lease-option agreement with Tidewater Services Corp, which merged with Midgard Energy Co., in 1994. That year, Midgard assigned its option to Richard Bass, William Herbert Hunt, and William Herbert Hunt Trust Estate. The option was extended multiple times through years while coal mining in the state lease area remained financially impractical. Early in 2008, Bass, Hunt and the Hunt Trust Estate assigned the Ladd Landing option to PacRim Coal LP. In March 2009, PacRim signed a letter of intent to exercise its Ladd Landing option. As of April 2009, the Kenai Peninsula Borough's Land Management Office had begun the process of bringing that lease to closing under the existing 1987 terms, a process that had to be completed within 180 days. According to borough officials, the two sides will renegotiate terms they have mutually agreed are outdated and in need of revision. Access No roads connect the project area to Alaska's highway system. The areas is accessible only by sea and air. Airstrips exist at Beluga and Tyonek. PacRim proposes to build a third airstrip in the project area. ConocoPhillips has a private strip south of the Beluga Power Plant. Gravel roads connect Tyonek and Beluga, and there are remnants of old roads used for logging, oil, gas and coal exploration efforts. Barge landing areas exist at Ladd Landing, Tyonek and Granite Point, and are used to supply local residents. Risks and rewards of development ;Risks Extracting coal from the Beluga Coal Fields is an idea decades old, but several factors have so far discouraged construction, including the costs associated with developing a mine, the market price of coal, the lack of demand for coal in Alaska, among others. In recent years, opposition to mining the fields has grown, specifically with respect to PacRim's Chuitna Coal Project, the project most advanced in state and federal permitting processes. Many Alaskans, including fisheries biologists, are voicing opposition because of the mine's proposed location amid environmentally important wetlands and because of the nature of coal itself. CriticsChuitna Citizens NOcoalition Press ReleaseTrustees for Alaska 2007 Annual Report Page 5 charge that development would devastate more than of critical wildlife habitat and destroy of salmon spawning streams. There is no precedent in Alaska for permitting mining in active salmon streams, and no guarantee that post-mine mitigation would restore the ecosystems. Chuitna would be the first if permits were granted. Regarding coal itself, the U.S. has about a quarter of the world's reserves; it has been called the Saudi Arabia of coal. U.S. coal-fired power plants generate roughly half the nation's electricity, according to the United States Department of Energy.U.S. Department of Energy-Coal But coal is problematic. It is dirtiest of fossil fuels,See wikipedia coal section: \\"Relative Carbon Cost\\" and burning it produces a third of the nation's carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas contributing to climate change. Because of PacRim's proposal, the non-profit organization American Rivers named the Chuitna one of America's 10 \\"Most Endangered Rivers\\" in 2007America's Most Endangered Rivers of 2007 American Rivers website and again in 2015.America‚Äôs Most Endangered Rivers of 2015 ;Rewards Chuitna's developers predict mine construction and operation will produce between 300 and 350 good-paying jobs, and royalties to the state upwards of $350 million over the 25-year lifespan of the first Logical Mining Unit project. PacRim also expects numerous service contracts with the local business community.Status Update Chuitna Coal Project (Produced by former PacRim contractor; DRven Corp. September 2007) Page 3 PacRim will develop Ladd Landing as a port (see above) for loading large vessels that would transport the coal to Asian markets. That port could be important for the future development of public and private property on the west side of Cook Inlet. The 300 million tons PacRim expects to excavate from its Chuitna mine is thought to equal two-thirds of the total recoverable coal in the Beluga Coal Fields.Prospects for Use of Alaska's Coals Steven Borell P.E., Executive Director, Alaska Miners Association Some estimates put the total at around 500 million tons. If the transport infrastructure to Cook Inlet is built, it is likely that, over time, coal mining in the region would expand. Environmental issues of the mining phase 2006 revisions to PacRim's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) filing with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shows the company expects to discharge more than of mine area runoff daily into salmon-bearing tributaries of the Chuitna River, including Creek 2002 (Lone Creek), Creek 2003 (Middle Creek) and Creek 2004. That effluent would reach Cook Inlet. The NPDES documents demonstrate that PacRim anticipates a variety of discharge pollutants, including organic carbon, assorted suspended solids, ammonia, nitrates, oil and grease, and metals including aluminum, iron, and manganese. In addition, housing and other operational facilities would be expected to discharge small amounts of fecal coliform and residual chlorine. According to the NPDES filing, PacRim would build four sedimentation ponds to remove some suspended solids. Three ponds would receive runoff from areas affected by mining operations, the fourth would receive runoff from mine facilities. Four outfall locations would discharge effluent to the fresh water creeks, waterbodies that support all five species of Pacific salmon, as well as Dolly Varden and trout. PacRim's mining project would carve through more than of Middle Creek. To date, no permit allowing mining operations to mine through and destroy a salmon stream has ever been issued by the Alaska Department of Natural Resources. Such a permit would be precedent-setting.Cook Inletkeeper Newsletter, Winter 2008-2009 See Page 4 Alaska has strict laws governing the protection of natural systems such as salmon streams. A clean, clear-water environment is crucial for successful natural salmon rearing.Alaska Division of Fish & Game \\"Small Fish\\" How those laws might be applied during the permitting process remains to be seen. PacRim's planned port at Ladd Landing would affect existing shoreline salmon set net fishing sites and the coal- loading trestle necessary to reach deep water would affect fish migration zones and the habitat of an endangered species of beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas also known as white whale) that is distinct to Cook Inlet. Under provisions of the 1973 Endangered Species Act, the National Marine Fisheries Service placed the Cook Inlet species on the nation's Endangered Species list.Federal Register, Vol. 73, No. 205, Oct. 22, 2008 What effect that may have on permitting PacRim's port facilities has yet to be determined. Post- mining environmental concerns Repairing the damage surface strip mining leaves behind is costly and a considerable physical enterprise. A specific federal law governs such recovery phases, and would apply to a Chuitna Coal Project. It is called the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977. The act created the Office of Surface Mining within the U.S. Department of the Interior. State programs - in Alaska's case, the Alaska Division of Mining, Land & WaterAlaska Division of Mining, Land & Water Division Permits page \\\\- generally regulate mines, but among the OSM's jobs is inspecting state programs to ensure they are meeting federal requirements.

He attended Brown College from 1819 to 1820, and worked as a teacher from 1820 to 1823. He graduated from Amherst College in 1825, and undertook graduate studies at Andover Theological Seminary from 1827 to 1830, and then at Newton Theological Institution in 1830.Amherst College Class of 1825 . Retrieved on February 21, 2009. He married Eliza Grew Jones on July 14, 1830, and was ordained in Boston on July 28, 1830, as a missionary to Burma under the American Baptist Missionary Union (ABMU). He and his wife set sail for the country shortly thereafter. Rev. and Mrs. Jones worked with Adoniram Judson in Burma, residing for about two years at Maulmein, and later at Rangoon. After Karl Gutzlaff petitioned the ABMU for more missionaries, the Rev. and Mrs. Jones were reassigned to Siam in 1832. Destined to become the first long-term Protestant missionaries in the country, they arrived in April 1833 on the schooner Reliance owned by Robert Hunter, who was a friend of the Siamese foreign minister (known only by his office, that of praklang.) Hunter had interceded with him on behalf of Rev. Gutzlaff, who, in an excess of zeal, offended the Siamese within the first two days of his arrival by throwing thousands of tracts into many cottages, and every floating house, boat, and junk‚Äîfollowing which he was ordered expelled and his tracts burnt. Hunter persuaded the praklang to have the tracts translated for the king to read. The king found nothing objectionable in them, but said candidly and openly that he preferred his own religion. The Rev. and Mrs. Jones were made welcome in the accommodations of the embassy of diplomatist Edmund Roberts until their own could be made ready. Hunter introduced Rev. Jones to the praklang, who received him with apparent kindness, likely because they were American citizens. Roberts, indeed, had been told American negotiations for a treaty were proceeding at an unprecedented pace. Rev. Jones informed Roberts that Major Burney, the British ambassador at the court of Ava who had six years previously negotiated the Burney Treaty, told Rev. Jones that Americans were decidedly preferred to any other foreigners. The praklang sent down a boat to convey Rev. Jones and his family to their new residence at Cokai, which had been arranged by the French-, English-, and Siamese‚Äìspeaking Portuguese consul Mr. Silveiro, near a campong [settlement] of Burmese. The residence had been previously occupied by a Mr. Abeel, another American missionary, of whom Roberts writes: Grave of J.T. and Eliza Jones and children > Mr. Abeel is held here in the highest estimation, by those who have the > pleasure of his acquaintance. He possesses talents of a very superior order, > and acquirements that do great credit to his industry; is mild and > conciliating in his manners, forcible in his arguments, yet possessing a > sufficient degree of zeal, never giving offence to the government, nor > creating dislike by being over-zealous, and thereby disgusting the natives; > but the bad state of his health would not permit him to remain on this good > missionary ground, which may be made, in a few years, ready for the harvest. Rev. Jones' proselytizing work was primarily with the Chinese in Bangkok. He founded a Chinese Baptist church in 1835. His first baptism was the re-baptism of Boon Tee, a Chaozhou Chinese who had previously been baptized by Gutzlaff, but not by immersion.Lee, Joseph Tse-Hei (2004).

He met the Ukrainian president (who authorized him to establish the National Institute of the Brain), attended private clubs and meetings of Ukrainian nomenklatura, befriended ministers and received a State Prize. Slyusarchuk forged documents, cheated the public at chess matches and memory demonstrations and practiced medicine without a license. He was interviewed by major newspapers, such as Trud: > As a teacher, as a psychiatrist, I can say pleno jure (with full right): > today it is dependent children who are mostly taught in the universities of > the country. All is about money, there is no natural scientific selection. > And earlier, in the 1980s and 90s, you had to withstand intellectual > contest. Today there is no necessity for it. Now a lot of mediocrities grind > away at their studies. But with mother's and father's money, they manage to > buy not only diplomas but also positions.  Biography  Based on journalism Slyusarchuk was born in Zhytomyr, Ukraine on 10 May 1971. His 21-year-old mother, Natalia Tykhonovna Slyusarchuk of Zhytomyr, left her newborn son at a maternity home. She did not know the name of the father of her child, and Slyusarchuk's middle name was recorded on his birth certificate as \\"Tykhonovych\\" (the masculine version of Natalia Slyusarchuk's patronymic). He was hospitalized at the Zhytomyr psychiatric hospital eight times between 1974 and 1987. From 1980 to 1987 (second to eighth grade) Slyusarchuk lived and studied at an institutional school for young orphans in the town of Hryshkivtsi in Berdychiv Raion, receiving a certificate for the completion of his education there. Nearly all the documents pertaining to his education at the school were later destroyed; his birth date became 19 May 1974 on some documents, yielding negative results for official inquiries about his time at the school. From 1987 to 1989, Slyusarchuk studied in the 208th group at the inter-regional Higher Vocational School of Railway Transport in Kozyatyn, Vinnytsia Oblast to become a plasterer-tiler-facing worker. On 2 October 1989, according to order No. 31, he was transferred to the Specialized Vocational School No. 62 in Chervonohrad, Lviv Oblast. According to teachers there, Slyusarchuk walked with a briefcase and a stethoscope like a doctor and conducted hypnosis sessions at a nearby school to earn money. On 1 June 1990, he received a certificate for the completion of his course; although his occupation was listed as \\"assistant foreman‚Äù, he was not appointed to a job. In 1993 Slyusarchuk was turned down for a position as a neurosurgeon at the hospital in Novoyavorivsk (Lviv Oblast), and later practiced medicine elsewhere. On 27 July 1996, the first criminal complaint was brought against Slyusarchuk. The Zhydachiv Raion police in Lviv Oblast) accused him of fraud, investigating the case for eight years. According to the complaint, Slyusarchuk diagnosed a woman with a fatal illness, promised to cure her with expensive drugs, took $665 from her and disappeared; it indicated that he had a diploma from the M. I. Pirogov Vinnytsia Medical Institute. In 1999, he taught in the departments of Engineering and Pedagogical Training at Lviv Polytechnic for about six months. According to his colleagues at Lviv, Slyusarchuk lectured on the psychology of managing people. His lectures were popular, with students cutting classes to listen to him, and were also attended by other teachers. On 17 July 2000, a second criminal complaint was brought against Slyusarchuk in Lviv. According to complainants Oleg and Bogdana Gamalii, they paid him $1,500 to treat their two young children; the children worsened following his treatment. After five years, the complaint was dropped. From 2003 to 2006 Slyusarchuk lived in a Lviv Polytechnic National University dormitory, where he fraudulently diagnosed students and \\"treated\\" them with psychotropic drugs. He extorted large amounts of money from parents for treatment, telling them that their children would commit suicide without it, and distributed unapproved drugs for $4,000 per ampoule. On 28 February 2006, Slyusarchuk claimed to have set a record by memorizing the numbers which make up pi. Journalists from Ekspres and Moskovskij Komsomolets noted that at his public performances, he was attended by a nearby assistant with a computer (and, perhaps, a small earphone). In March 2006, Slyusarchuk began work as an associate professor at the Chornovil Lviv State Institute of Modern Technology and Management and became a professor in the general-law department that year. At the end of October 2008 the media reported that he had applied for emigration to Canada, where he could undertake studies impossible to obtain in Ukraine. From June 2008 to February 2010, Slyusarchuk was a professor of neurosurgery at the P.L. Shupyk National Medical Academy of Postgraduate Education. According to department head Mykola Polishchuk, when Slyusarchuk read several pages from a medical book given him by Polishchuk and recited them from memory he was hired. Slyusarchuk lectured on the subject of memory, and Polishchuk said that colleagues had found Slyusarchuk's 2002 dissertation on the Internet. Polishchuk later found a 2000 dissertation by Nikolai Ershov in the Russian State Library in Moscow; the only difference between Ershov's dissertation and Slyusarchuk's was in the title. After Polishchuk's report to the rector, an order to dismiss Slyusarchuk was issued. When the academic administration requested verification from the Higher Attestation Commission of the Ministry of Education of Russia of Slyusarchuk's credentials, it was told that there was no record of him as a professor or a Doctor of Science. He was a professor in the Department of Information Systems and Networks at Lviv Polytechnic from September 2009 to June 2011. From 9 December 2009 to 11 March 2010, Slyusarchuk was an adviser to Oleksandr Turchynov in the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers. With journalist Igor Yurchenko, he anchored the program Mind Games on Radio Era from 2009 to 2011. On 22 December 2009, Slyusarchuk discussed an Institute of the Brain with Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko; Yushchenko issued a decree establishing it that day. On 26 December the Mirror Weekly reported in an interview with Slyusarchuk that he had been offered the position of head of the institute and hoped to implement his plans. He said in another interview that the institute's annual budget would be ‚Ç¥500 million. In 2010 the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine, headed by Dmytro Tabachnyk, reportedly gave Slyusarchuk a document making him a professor in the department of neurosurgery at the A. P. Romodanov Institute of Neurosurgery. The Higher Attestation Commission of Ukraine refused to recognize the professorship, nullifying a professorship allegedly given him in Russia, and the Russian professorship proved false. In 2010 Slyusarchuk practiced disaster medicine, performed surgery throughout Ukraine and conducted behavioral experiments on rats in his one-room apartment with his assistant Chervoniy, a neuromagnetic stimulator and other devices. A newspaper article about the devices called them part of a prototypical psychotropic weapon. On 25 May 2011, Dmytro Pavlychko, Levko Lukyanenko, Yuri Palchukovsky and Volodymyr Pylypchuk appealed to President Viktor Yanukovych to establish the Institute of the Brain and invite Slyusarchuk to head it because he was threatening to leave Ukraine for intellectual reasons. According to Slyusarchuk, the institute's primary aim would be \\"to engage specialists, to be active ‚Äî [to] have the possibility to be a scientist\\". In Ukrainian: Anatoly Kashpirovsky, whom Slysarchuk called \\"my idol in the profession\\", also lobbied for the institute's establishment. On 9 June 2011 he was first criticized in the press, by the weekly 2000. On 30 September 2011, Slysarchuk received the 2011 State Prize of Ukraine for \\"scientific achievements in the field of education\\": a series of works, The Complex of Educational Information Technologies for Presenting, Memorizing and Processing Superlarge Information Objects in the Learning Process. The Lviv newspaper Ekspres published the first of a series of articles criticizing him, \\"The Sensational Exposure of Pseudo-professor Pi\\", on 6 October 2011. It was followed by \\"The First Victims of Pseudo-professor Pi\\", \\"Pseudo-doctor Slyusarchuk Kills People\\", \\"The Cheap Tricks of Professor Pi\\", \\"The New Victims of the Pseudo-Doctor\\", \\"Pseudo-doctor Slyusarchuk is in a Trap\\", \\"Pseudo-doctor Slyusarchuk Buried His Mother Alive\\", \\"The Pseudo-Doctor Sows New Deaths\\", \\"It is Just a Shock. The Pseudo-doctor Kills the Child of a Priest\\", \\"The Pi Record is Cancelled\\", \\"The Pi Record is Falsified,\\" \\"The Secret Protectors of Doctor Pi\\", \\"The Pseudo-Doctor Again Picked Up a Scalpel\\", \\"The Perverts of Minister Tabachnyk\\", \\"The Pseudo-Doctor, Sex and Drugs\\", \\"The Grave Sin of Minister Tabachnyk\\", \\"Three More New Victims of the Pseudo-Doctor\\" (a video), \\"The New Attitude of Doctor Pi\\", \\"The Intelligentsia of the Lviv Oblast Demand that Tabachnyk, Who is an Accessory of Doctor Pi, Be Relieved of His Position\\", \\"The Computer Operator of Doctor Pi Speaks Out\\", \\"New Actions Brought Against the Pseudo-Doctor\\", \\"A New Death in the Case of Doctor Pi\\", \\"The Millions of Doctor Pi Against Ekspres\\", \\"The Inquest Breaks the Action Brought Against Doctor Pi\\", \\"Doctor Pi is Ignorant of Even Arithmetic\\", \\"Doctor Pi Took Up to Tens of Thousands\\". After the Ekspres articles were published, criminal complaints were again brought against Slyusarchuk. On 14 November 2011 he was charged with fraud by the Berkut, and on 21 November he was informed that his records memorizing pi were canceled and removed from The Book of Records of Ukraine. From 2 February to 1 March 2012, Slyusarchuk underwent a medical and psychiatric examination at the Lviv Oblast Psychiatric Hospital. The examination found him partially sane, authorizing a psychiatrist to supervise and treat him in a prison if and when needed. From 2 July to fall 2012, Slyusarchuk received a second psychiatric examination at the Pavlov Psychiatric Hospital in Kiev. On 14 February 2014 the Sykhiv Raion Court sentenced him to eight years in prison, with the judge reading the 150-page sentence based on the 26-volume criminal-case transcript. In Ukrainian: Based on interviews According to a birth certificate shown to journalists, Slyusarchuk was born in the village of Tuƒü in the Hadrut Rayon of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic. His father was Mushegyan Vartan Aramovich, an ethnic Armenian. His mother, a Ukrainian, was Ruslana Tykhonovna Slyusarchuk. The Hadrut Rayon civil registry reportedly changed his birth details to his mother's by request in 1984, and he became Andriy Tykhonovych Slyusarchuk. Slyusarchuk said that he graduated from secondary school in Vinnytsia at age nine. His parents, medical professionals (his mother a pediatrician and his father a cardiac surgeon), died in a car accident the year he graduated from secondary school. During the 1980s he was subjected to punitive psychiatry, physically abused and sent to a psychiatric hospital where he was tied to a bed, given psychoactive drugs and injected with sulfozin. When the psychiatrists asked him which books he was reading, Slyusarchuk said that he was reading medical literature and works by Ivan Pavlov and Vladimir Lenin. He was sent to an institution for the mentally-ill children. Slyusarchuk was placed in a Soviet orphanage, where he was misunderstood by his teachers and encouraged to conform. When he tried to retrieve his secondary-school certification to enter a higher educational institution, he was labeled mentally ill and punished. At age 11, Slyusarchuk ran away from the orphanage. He taught himself by reading the book Your Abilities, Man, which was given to him by Soviet psychiatrist Andrei Snezhnevsky (who examined him when he was a child). When Slyusarchuk arrived in Moscow he found a Gypsy camp, where he was accepted, fed and taught to beg for money. At the time, he felt the environment was what he needed; he learned about Gypsy hypnotism and its use. After living with the Gypsies for about a year, Slyusarchuk met an employee of the Russian National Research Medical University. They became friends, and through him Slyusarchuk received an appointment with Soviet Minister of Health Yevgeniy Chazov. With Chazov's help, at age 12 Slyusarchuk entered the general-therapy department of the Russian State Medical University. He specialized in neurosurgery under Professor E. I. Gusev (–ì—É—Å–µ–≤ –ï.–ò.), and his teachers included neurologists V. A. Karlov (–ö–∞—Ä–ª–æ–≤ –í. –ê.), A. N. Konovalov and A. M. Vein (–í–µ–π–Ω –ê.–ú.). Slyusarchuk claimed to have graduated from the Russian National Research Medical University with an honorable diploma at 18, beginning a postgraduate course without the usual internship. His partial reported timeline was: * 1985 ‚Äî Entered the 2nd Moscow State Medical University, named after Nikolay Pirogov and now known as the Russian National Research Medical University. * 1992 ‚Äî Entered the St Petersburg University medical psychology faculty. * 1998 ‚Äî Defended his Candidate of Sciences dissertation. * 2003 ‚Äî Defended his Doctor of Sciences dissertation. * 2006 ‚Äî Claimed a world record for memorizing 5,100 digits in 117 seconds, not accepted by international organizations. In June 2009, after claiming a world record for memorizing pi by being able to recite randomly selected sequences from the first 30 million places of pi, Slyusarchuk was congratulated by Ukrainian President Viktor Yuschenko and funding for a research center for the development of Slyusarchuk's methodology was discussed.Victor Yushchenko meets Andriy Slyusarchuk–Æ—â–µ–Ω–∫–æ –ø–æ–∑–¥—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ª –Ω–µ–π—Ä–æ—Ö–∏—Ä—É—Ä–≥–∞, –∑–∞–ø–æ–º–Ω–∏–≤—à–µ–≥–æ 30 –º–∏–ª–ª–∏–æ–Ω–æ–≤ —Ü–∏—Ñ—Ä A December 22 press release from the President of Ukraine reported that Yushchenko and Slyusarchuk had discussed an Institute of Brain Studies to prevent and treat neurological disorders, focusing on social problems such as drug and alcohol abuse. Yushchenko issued a decree providing for the Institute of Brain Studies, for research in neurology, psychiatry, psychology and neurorehabilitation, to be established within one month. Slyusarchuk claimed that his memorization skills were based on mental associations between figures, images, words, numbers (mnemonics) and a photographic memory of everything on which he concentrates. According to the scientists verifying Slyusarchuk's records, \\"The mnemonic technique can be used by any person\\". A February 2010 article in the newspaper Novaya reported that Slyusarchuk's student, Alexander Chervonyi, claimed that he could reproduce many of his teacher's memory performances including the recitation of randomly-selected sequences from the first five million decimal places of pi. Slyusarchuk became interested in chess. In April 2011, he defeated the chess program Rybka in an exhibition match in Kiev while blindfolded. On 26 May, Slyusarchuk said that he memorized 2,600 books on chess in preparation for the game with Rybka. The Trinidad and Tobago Guardian newspaper published an account of Slyusarchuk's victory over Rybka as \\"Oh, the wonders of gullibility\\", quoting the Internet- based chess newspaper Chess Today: \\"What can help [to prove that it was a mystification] are Slyusarchuk‚Äôs numerous absurd statements which show his complete ignorance of chess‚Äîquite unforgivable for a guy who has read, as is claimed, more than 2000 chess books within several months!\\" According to Slyusarchuk's friend, journalist Igor Yurchenko, no one argued that Slyusarchuk played chess better than a world champion or a grandmaster; at the time, Slyusarchuk stressed that it was not a chess event but a demonstration of memory. Sponsors bought Slyusarchuk a heavy-duty computer which played many games daily with another comparable computer, and he memorized the strategy of these games. Memorizing thousands of chess games reportedly helped him defeat the Rybka-4; according to Yurchenko, Slyusarchuk just recalled memorized games.  Memorization and hypnosis Slyusarchuk claimed to have set records for memorizing large amounts of digital data, sequences of geometric figures, words and other information, including one million digits of the figure pi.–ù–æ–≤–∏–π —Å–≤i—Ç–æ–≤–∏–π —Ä–µ–∫–æ—Ä–¥ —É –∑–∞–ø–∞–º'—è—Ç–æ–≤—É–≤–∞–Ω–Ωi –π –≤i–¥–æ–±—Ä–∞–∂–µ–Ω–Ωi –ª—é–¥–∏–Ω–æ—é —á–∏—Å–ª–∞ –øi –≤ –æ–±—Å—è–∑i –æ–¥–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ºi–ª—å–π–æ–Ω–∞ –∑–Ω–∞–∫i–≤ (!) –≤—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏–≤ –¥–æ–∫—Ç–æ—Ä –º–µ–¥–∏—á–Ω–∏—Ö –Ω–∞—É–∫ –ê–Ω–¥—Äi–π –°–ª—é—Å–∞—Ä—á—É–∫ By 2008, he claimed to have memorized two million decimal places of pi and about 7,000 volumes of text; by the following year, his claim had increased to 15,000 volumes.

On a TV show, he hypnotized students of the L'viv University of Modern Technology (–õ—å–≤—ñ–≤—Å—å–∫–∏–π –¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞–≤–Ω–∏–π —ñ–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ç –Ω–æ–≤—ñ—Ç–Ω—ñ—Ö —Ç–µ—Ö–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥—ñ–π —Ç–∞ —É–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª—ñ–Ω–Ω—è —ñ–º. –í. –ß–æ—Ä–Ω–æ–≤–æ–ª–∞) into believing that the onions they ate were apples. Slyusarchuk demonstrated hypnosis of a salesman who accepted a ‚Ç¥1 bill, thinking it was a ‚Ç¥500 bill. His televised demonstration of chess-position memory (memorizing all pieces on 80 boards) was criticized by invited chess master Grigoriy Timoshenko, who said that he was 99.9-percent sure that the performance was fake, and a New York Times article called Slyusarchuk \\"an illusionist\\".  Forgery and fraud  Letter from the Russian National Research Medical University published by Ekspres, stating that Slyusarchuk never graduated from the university On 6 October 2011 the Lviv newspaper Ekspres published its first article critical of Slyusarchuk, \\"The Sensational Exposure of Pseudo-Professor Pi\\", accusing him of forgery and fraud and investigating him in subsequent articles. Three weeks later, the newspaper published a letter from the Russian National Research Medical University saying that Slyusarchuk had not studied at the university. On 10 January 2012 the newspaper released a video of brain surgery performed by Slyusarchuk, surrounded by assistants in an operating room; in the video, he wiped his scalpel with cotton wool before incising the patient's brain. On 14 March Ekspres published an interview with Andriy Novosad, who told reporters that he wrote a computer program which Slyusarchuk tested with radio equipment for the pi demonstrations and created articles which were published in Slyusarchuk's name. After the Ekspres articles attracted widespread publicity Slyusarchuk denied the accusations in interviews for other media sources, saying that he had applied to the General Prosecutor of Ukraine to clarify the situation and disprove the Ekspres allegations. On 14 November 2011, the Ukrainian police detained him on suspicion of forgery and fraud. During the investigation, senior officials of the Ministry of Education and Science, Youth and Sport of Ukraine (including department heads and the vice- minister) had told the press that Slyusarchuk's documents and scientific titles were valid according to Ukrainian law and protocol. Large portions of Slyusarchuk's scientific works were considered classified, with state secrets privilege in Ukraine and Russia. At Slyusarchuk's trial people who admired him and invited him to work for them testified that although they were aware that he was not a doctor, they did not report him; he continued to practice neurosurgery in hospitals. From 2 February to 1 March 2012, Slyusarchuk underwent a psychiatric examination at Lviv Oblast Psychiatric Hospital. The examination found Slyusarchuk partially sane from a legal standpoint; he had a \\"mixed personality disorder with a predominance of dissocial, hysterical and narcissistic elements\\". According to Alexander Soroka, Slyusarchuk is mentally ill but responsible for his actions; if such a person is imprisoned, they would be supervised and treated by a psychiatrist as needed. The examination results were questioned by Ukrainian psychiatrist Semyon Gluzman: \\"If Doctor Pi begins to testify, a lot of compromising materials on the powerful of the world can appear. But in this way, it all can be attributed to his mental illness. I saw many performances of Slyusarchuk on television, listened to his speeches on radio and did not notice any signs of mental illness\\". According to Gluzman, none of his colleagues suspected that Slyusarchuk was mentally ill. He received a second psychiatric examination at Pavlov Psychiatric Hospital in Kiev from 2 July to the fall of 2012. Ministry of Internal Affairs public-affairs department head Volodymyr Polishchuk said, \\"Independent examination [was] conducted to check Slyusarchuk's mental health and his possible psychic and hypnotic abilities\\". Slyusarchuk's first attorneys had based their strategy on a finding of mental incompetence, a strategy with which he disagreed. In his final testimony at the trial Slyusarchuk said, \\"The logic of such 'expert opinions' is simple: to diminish the defendant's attempts to adduce evidence in his defense, to force court and public not to believe a word said by him, he is declared out of his mind. The true value of such 'examinations' is known because since the USSR punitive psychiatry has been a trusted servant of the NKVD and the KGB.\\" According to investigators, he did not graduate from a university; his background consisted of an institutional school, a sewing vocational school in Chervonohrad and treatment at the Zhytomyr psychiatric hospital. With his forged credentials, he worked as a neurosurgeon and held senior positions for long periods. According to a former agent of the USSR secret service who knew Slyusarchuk by sight, he was probably a product of a secret KGB pilot project. The agent was aware of a program in which orphans with unusual abilities were recruited throughout the Soviet Union; many died as a result of neurological experiments, but Slyusarchuk survived. He believes that Slyusarchuk participated in the secret pilot projects, receiving a professorship in return. His medical knowledge was derived from books and his memory was actually faulty; over time, he came to believe that he actually held the university diplomas. According to the agent, sealed documents about Slyusarchuk are stored in the KGB archives. Slyusarchuk maintained that his case was fabricated by the Prosecutor General and the Security Service of Ukraine. In 2005, he reportedly accidentally damaged his original diploma from the Russian National Research Medical University; a month later he received a duplicate, and denied any forgery. In 2003 Slyusarchuk reportedly met with Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) agents, agreeing in writing not to disclose the results of his scientific works and advising the Ukrainian government. In 2011, he traveled to Moscow and asked the former FSB curator for help. When Slyusarchuk was told that the FSB would confirm his education and academic degrees if he cooperated with them, he refused. Under questioning, the head of the university archives testified that Slyusarchuk showed her his damaged diploma in 2005 and his full name was legible. Verifying his surname in the registry, the woman submitted a request to the rector for approval. He did so, adding the instructions: \\"Carry out according to procedure\\"; the university neither proved nor disproved whether Slyusarchuk originally received a diploma from them. At a 16 December 2011 press conference, Minister of Education and Science Dmytro Tabachnyk said that his ministry's Russian counterpart admitted that it had mistakenly issued Slyusarchuk a duplicate diploma. At the press conference, Slyusarchuk's diplomas (including a duplicate) were demonstrated to be scanned documents.  Conviction and sentencing  In the Verkhovna Rada, Slyusarchuk's activities were called \\"the largest-scale fraud in the 20 years of Ukrainian independence\\". According to the Ukrainian Independent Information Agency, his defrauding of government agencies is unprecedented. In 2012, Ukrainsky Medychny Chasopys (Ukrainian Medical Journal) published the outcome of his case entitled, \\"Head doctors who let the person without medical training into operating room should be held criminally responsible.\\" In the article, Ukrainian psychiatrist Semyon Gluzman expressed the opinion that Slyusarchuk skillfully took advantage of poor security; if he had chosen a lower-profile specialty, he might have succeeded. According to Gluzman, Ukraine has hundreds of people with the degree of Doctor of Sciences with expertise comparable to Slyusarchuk's. In the journal, Doctor of Science Olga Bogomolets wrote that the admission of a person without medical training to an operating room violated laws clearly regulating who can practice medicine, when and where; a hospital supervising physician who violates the law must be held accountable. On 14 February 2014, the Sykhiv Raion Court sentenced Slyusarchuk to eight years in prison after finding him guilty of five counts of illegal medical activities and two counts of murder by negligence: a 52-year-old named Lozovoy and three-year-old Daniil Prokopchuk of Ternopil Oblast. He was also found guilty of knowingly using forged documents and five counts of appropriating another's property by deception and breach of confidence (fraud). The court upheld victim claims, with Slyusarchuk fined about $40,000 (the amount of money paid for his services). He was also fined ‚Ç¥70,000 to compensate Lozovoy's family and ‚Ç¥30,000 for each of the other four victims. Slyusarchuk was fined a total of ‚Ç¥500,000 in victim compensation and ‚Ç¥44,000 in state fines. The court found that Slyusarchuk's diplomas from the Moscow and Vinnytsia medical universities were falsified. In a five-bed prison cell furnished with a table, a washstand, a toilet, bookshelves, a TV and a radio, he reads books on medicine, the criminal code and the criminal-procedure code. In September 2014 Slyusarchuk dismissed his attorneys, telling them that for what he paid for their services he could have bought ten more diplomas. He distrusts defense attorneys, feeling that they do their job poorly, and hoped to appeal his conviction at the regular session of the Lviv Oblast Appeal Court scheduled for 1 October 2014.  State award  On 30 September 2011, Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych issued Decree No 960/2011 awarding Slyusarchuk the 2011 State Prize of Ukraine for \\"scientific achievements in the field of education\\" for a series of works: \\"The complex of educational information technologies for presenting, memorizing and processing superlarge information objects in the learning process\\". Slyusarchuk's research involved the technology of inputting large amounts of information into electronic databases and its playback. Portions on which Slyusarchuk worked are stamped \\"secret\\". Slyusarchuk's portions were published in Russia and are secret. His research was nominated by the academic administration of Lviv Polytechnic for the State Prize, and the issue was debated in Kiev by a commission of Ukrainian scientists. As a State Prize laureate Slyusarchuk would have received ‚Ç¥150,000; he did not, after his detention for fraud by the Berkut on 14 November 2011. The decree awarding the State Prize is unrevoked, describing his credentials as a professor of Information Systems and Networks at Lviv Polytechnic and a Doctor of Sciences in medicine.  Documentaries  Documentaries and TV programs have been made about Slyusarchuk, including a 2008 BBC documentary. In 2009 the STB Channel broadcast the documentary, Pravyla Zhyttya: Povelyteli Svidomosti (The Rules of Life: The Rulers of Consciousness). In 2012 the HTH channel broadcast a documentary by Oleg Vasilevsky, Nezbagnenna Afera Doktora (The Incredible Fraud of Doctor Pi). On 26 December 2012 the –¢–°–ù channel broadcast a documentary, Ukrainski–µ Sensatsyi: Rascryli Vse Tainy \\"Doktora Pi\\" (Ukrainian Sensation: The Secrets of Doctor Pi).

According to the Estonian Encyclopedia's definition, he \\"wrote plenty of irritating publicist articles\\". Gustav Naan was born in Russian SFSR in a village near Vladivostok to a family of Estonian settlers. He graduated from the Leningrad State University in 1941. He took part in World War II and joined the CPSU in 1943. Having settled to Estonia after the USSR annexed Estonia, Gustav Naan, a loyal communist and graduate of the Higher Party School of the AUCP(b) (1946) published a number of Stalinist-oriented polemic pieces (treating Estonian history and politics from the pro-Soviet perspective, e.g. \\"Eesti kodanlike natsionalistide ideoloogia reaktsiooniline olemus‚Ä≥ ('The Reactionary Essence of the Ideology of Estonian Bourgeois Nationalists'), 1947). In 1948, Naan published an article in Voprosy filosofiiG. I. Naan, \\"Sovremennyi 'fizicheskii' idealizm v SShA i Anglii na sluzhbe popovshchiny i reaktsii,\\" Voprosy filosofii, No. 2 ( 1948), pp. 290 ff on the philosophical implications of the theory of relativity, criticizing 'physical idealists' of the US and Britain;Loren R. Graham, Science and Philosophy in the Soviet Union (New York: Knopf, 1972), p. 115. in 1951, however, he published an article that decried vulgar materialist critics of the relativity theory whilst being ‚Ä≥tolerant on philosophic questions to a striking degree in Stalinist Russia, considering its place and time of publication‚Ä≥.Graham 1972:118. Authors who followed Naan's article into discussion were almost universally critical of Naan's position. In 1952, which was the most intense year of the debate, three different authorsV. Shtern, K voprosu o filosofskoi storone teorii otnositel'nosti; D. I. Blokhintsev , Za leninskoe uchenie o dvizhenii; G. A. Kursanov, \\"K kriticheskoi otsenke teorii otnositel'nosti\\"; Voprosy filosofii, No. 1 ( 1952), pp. 175-81, 181-3, 169-74. published against Naan in the 1952 first issue of Voprosy filosofii alone.Graham 1972:119. Naan was the director of the Institute of History of the Academy of Sciences of the Estonian SSR (1950‚Äì1951), Vice-President of the Academy of Sciences of the Estonian SSR (1951‚Äì1964). From 1964, Naan worked at the Institute of Astrophysics and Atmosphere Physics of the Academy of Sciences of the Estonian SSR. Having turned to theorizing on cosmology, cybernetics and demography, he often rejected taboos of both the 'traditional' world-view and orthodox communist opinions on such matters. He often juxtaposed what he saw as a science-based world-view with a trivial thinking (Estonian: \\"argim√µtlemine\\"), which he saw both among common people, the intelligentsia as well as the ruling classes. He later claimed to have been one of the promoters of the theory of relativity at the time this was still considered pseudoscience by the Soviet authorities. The influential 1968 article \\"V√µim ja vaim\\" (roughly \\"The Power and the Mind\\") was widely read among the liberal intelligentsia, who interpreted it as a critique of the administrative/bureaucratic socialism and command economy.Article on Naan in the Estonian Biographical Lexicon of Science (p. 19) His articles such as this enjoyed popularity in Russia, too. In the 1960s and 1970s he often held lectures either in the assembly hall of the Tallinn Polytechnical Institute or (as initiated on his own initiative) in T√µravere as seminars of philosophy, often balancing between the permissible by the authorities and impermissible. He also proposed the Symmetric Universe hypothesis, according to which, side by side with the ordinary world, there is an anti-world.'Any quantity of energy can be trapped from vacuum if the corresponding mechanism provides a simultaneous trapping of the same quantity of energy in the anti-world. The total sum energy is equal to zero.' Gustav Naan, 'Symmetrical universe', 1964, Tartu, Estonia. His ideas have been characterized as \\"viewpoints that have been recognized as valuable from the scientific point of view\\".Cited in Naan was editor-in-chief of Eesti n√µukogude ents√ºklopeedia (literally: Estonian Soviet Encyclopedia), the first edition of which started in the late 1960s. The encyclopedia was highly successful in Estonia. In terms of political affiliations, Naan remained a staunch supporter of the Soviet system (initially an enthusiastic supporter of Perestroika though) and was a devote opponent of Estonia's pro-independence movement;In an ironic piece of warning written after the Estonian youth rebellion of 1980, he put it thus: Estonia as nation developed only one hundred years ago and will disappear \\"in the coming centuries\\" - –ì. –ù–∞–∞–Ω \\"–ú–Ω–æ–≥–æ–æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–∏–µ –µ–¥–∏–Ω–æ–≥–æ\\" - \\"–ö–æ–º–º—É–Ω–∏—Å—Ç –≠—Å—Ç–æ–Ω–∏–∏\\", 1983, –Ω–æ–º–µ—Ä 1, —Å. 228. Cited in Sowjetsystem und Ostrecht By Georg Brunner, p. 274 Naan supported the (pro- Moscow) Internationalist Movement. Having gained much public support in the 1970s for his relatively bold opinion pieces on topics like family, the rising divorce rate (that he argued was more or less a normal development), morals and sex (the importance of which, he argued, was being downplayed out of pseudomoralistic argumentation), he soon became a despised figure for his anti-independence stance, which was reflected in his newspaper articles of the time (e.g. his article ¬´–° –Ω–æ–≥ –Ω–∞ –≥–æ–ª–æ–≤—É¬ª ('From (standing on) Feet to (standing on) Head', Estonian title \\"K√µik pea peale‚Ä≥), condemning the Estonian Sovereignty Declaration passed by the Supreme Soviet of the Estonian SSR, was published in Pravda, 23. November 1988.). He also published a number of articles where he either tried to downplay or rationalize Stalinist repressions. His stance almost led to his expulsion from the Academy of Sciences.  Opinions on him  *Academician Jaan Einasto: \\"Naan had no illusions as to the Soviet reality.\\"Jaan Einasto. \\"Tumeda aine lugu\\". Tartu: Ilmamaa, 2006, lk 224 *Academician Erast Parmasto: \\"Gustav Naan was a man with a sharp mind and one with an even sharper tongue, a \\"self-made man\\", who had preferred to the party functionary's career a much calmer and congenial life of a scientist.\\" *Academician Hans Trass: \\"How terrible, that a man, who could inspiringly write about the predominance of the mind over the power developed into a justificator of the reign of terror. Such a person is an example of a broken, deformed mentality, that was shaped by the Stalinist antihumanism and obedience to fear.\\" *Literary critic Vaapo Vaher: \\"Naan could be treated as a Soviet dandy, a Soviet Dorian Gray. ... During his days of glory the academician had on the local intellectual society an impression of some exotic creature ... Dorian Gray and his creator Oscar Wilde can be treated as marthyrs of esthetism, Naan was destroyed by the evil of dogmaticism. Add to this [his] personal vanity. His story could be treated as the occurrence of the good and the vice in the human being, it can be seen against the background of the mystery of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.\\"  Bibliography  *\\"Dependence and opposition.

Black Jack sails on the Ottawa River between Brittania Yacht Club and Quyon, Quebec. On May 2, 2004, STV Black Jack was designated \\"Ottawa's Signature Tall Ship\\". Black Jack was the first ship in service with Bytown Brigantine, Inc., a charitable organization devoted to providing sail training adventure for youth. This brigantine is home to 15 youth between the ages of 12 and 15 during the summer months. The program is designed to develop character and foster leadership, confidence and self- reliance in youth through the medium of sail training. Her sister ship, , is also in use by Bytown Brigantine on the Great Lakes and Canada's east coast. Black Jack is steel-hulled with wooden bilge keels. Her sparred length is , length on deck , and beam . She draws , which allows her to go almost anywhere a keelboat can, which is very useful when maneuvering the Ottawa River and docking at her berth in Britannia Yacht Club. She can be seen at the yacht club but is not open to the public except on special occasions. Her mast height is and she carries a total of of sail area on nine sails. History Sail Training Vessel (STV) Black Jack Black Jack was originally a logging tug on the Upper Ottawa River and was based in Quyon, Quebec. She was built in Scotland in 1904 and made her way to Canada that same year. In 1952, the ship was converted by the late Captain Thomas G. Fuller into a brigantine. She operated as the Fuller family yacht for several years until her sister ship was built in 1982. Rather than see the ship fall into disuse, Captain Fuller's son, Simon Fuller, refitted the ship with the intention of using her as a sail training vessel. She made her sail training debut in 1983 and in the summer of 1984 attended the 450th Anniversary of Jacques Cartier's Landing in Quebec City with many other international tall ships. Since then, Black Jack has remained on the Ottawa River where she is the focal point of the Black Jack Island Adventure Camp for youth. In 2004, Black Jack celebrated her centennial birthday. Adrienne Clarkson, then Governor General of Canada, re-christened Black Jack at Britannia Yacht Club and helped Bytown Brigantine wish the ship well on her next 100 years of service in the Ottawa area. In 2012, Black Jack helped Britannia Yacht Club celebrate her 125th anniversary. Black Jack Island Adventure Camp STV Black Jack on the Britannia Yacht Club's Commodore's Sail Past 2015 Black Jack is now part of a sail-training summer camp for youth 12‚Äì15 years olds on the Ottawa River. Based on a private island near Fitzroy Harbour, Ontario, participants work closely with crew to learn all aspects of seamanship, from hoisting sails and learning basic navigation to tying knots and steering. The island is used to teach campers other aspects of sailing, navigation and teamwork. Participants sleep either aboard Black Jack (on deck or down below depending on weather), or on a floating bunkhouse moored at the island. Black Jack's Fleet Black Jack is supported by two navy whalers and two barges. The two whalers, Agnes Irving and Alan E. Jacques, are -long traditional navy boats that can be sailed or rowed with sweeps. They have two masts, a lug-rigged main mast and a driving mizzen, as well as being equipped with diesel outboard engines. They were traditionally used as training boats by the Royal Canadian Navy. Two barges are kept moored at the island during the summer months. The Stanley Carson Bunk Barge is an authentic logging bunkhouse that was used by loggers on the Ottawa River. The two-story barge provides accommodation and cooking facilities for up to 30 people. The second barge is equipped as a well-stocked supply barge, large enough to carry vehicles and equipment.

Occupations at this rockshelter date to the Later Stone Age.Cornelissen, Els (2002) Human Responses to Changing Environments in Central Africa Between 40,000 and 12,000 B.P. Journal of World Prehistory 16(3):197-235. This region is important to investigations of the development and subsequent diffusion of the Bantu culture.Lavachery, Philippe (2001) The Holocene Archaeological Sequence of Shum Laka Rock Shelter (Grasslands, Western Cameroon). African Archaeological Review 18(4):213-247. The site of Shum Laka is located approximately 15 kilometers from the town of Bamenda, and it resides on the inner wall of the Bafochu Mbu caldera.Willoughby, Pamela (2006) The Evolution of Modern Humans in Africa: A Comprehensive Guide, Rowman Altamira. The deposits at Shum Laka include each phase of cultural development in the Grasslands. Geoarchaeology of Shum Laka The rockshelter itself at Shum Laka is approximately 50 meters wide at its greatest point and 20 meters deep.Lavachery, Philippe and Els Cornelissen (2000) Natural and Cultural Spatial Patterning in the Late Holocene Deposits of Shum Laka Rock Shelter, Cameroon. Journal of Field Archaeology 27(2):153-168. Stratigraphic dating of surface and near surface deposits support occupations as early as 30,000 BP. Geomorphological analysis determined that the rockshelter had been subjected to alluvial depositional events during the Holocene, but archaeological deposits remained mostly intact and in situ.Moeyersons, Jan (1997) Geomorphological Processes and their Palaeoenvironmental Significance at the Shum Laka cave (Bamenda, Western Cameroon). Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 133:103-116. Fluvial erosional processes at the site were determined to have had their greatest impact laterally, and thus not damaged contextual integrity between cultural occupations. The importance of geoarchaeological investigations conducted at Shum Laka includes the construction of a reliable cultural chronology of the area, and an emphasis on the need to critically evaluate other rockshelter sites in the region. Archaeological deposits At Shum Laka, over 1,000 ceramic sherds, nearly 500,000 pieces of lithic materials, and 18 human skeletons were recovered. Radiocarbon dating of the bone and plant remains recovered demonstrated multiple occupations spanning from 30,000 BP to around 400 BP.Cornelissen, Els (2003) On Microlithic Quartz Industries at the End of the Pleistocene in Central Africa: The Evidence from Shum Laka (NW Cameroon). African Archaeological Review 20(1):1-24. Bone preservation from the early occupations is poor, with only a few surviving faunal remains and no bone tools. Later occupations depict common exploitation of medium- sized fauna from the forest.de Maret, Pierre, Bernard Clist, and Wim Van Neer (1987) Resultats des premieres fouilles dans les abris de Shum Laka et D'Abeke au nord-ouest du Cameroun. L'Anthropologie 91(2):559-584. These remains include those from several gorillas and chimpanzees, and various artiodactyla. Based upon the small amounts of materials found in individual strata, it is proposed that the site was occupied for numerous short periods of time. Macrobotanical remains recovered included both savanna grasses and forest trees. These indicate that for a period of occupation during the Holocene, Shum Laka was located within an ecotone. Ceramic assemblages recovered from the site date from 7000 BP onward and are indicative of continued longer occupation by semi-agricultural populations. Additionally, these ceramic assemblages indicate the use of the rockshelter by different groups of peoples and that these people interacted with various western African states.  PaleoDNA  Geneticists sequenced genome-wide DNA data from four people buried at the site of Shum Laka in Cameroon between 8000‚Äì3000 years ago. One individual 2/SEIIAncient West African foragers in the context of African population history (PDF), 2020 carried the deeply divergent Y chromosome haplogroup A00 found at low frequencies among some present-day Niger-Congo speakers, but the genome-wide ancestry profiles for all four individuals are very different from the majority of West Africans today and instead are more similar to West-Central African hunter-gatherers. Despite the geographic proximity of Shum Laka to the hypothesized birthplace of Bantu languages and the temporal range of our samples bookending the initial Bantu expansion, these individuals are not representative of a Bantu source population. Phylogenetic model including Shum Laka features three major radiations within Africa: one phase early in the history of modern humans, one close to the time of the migration giving rise to non-Africans, and one in the past several thousand years. Present-day West Africans and some East Africans, in addition to Central and Southern African hunter-gatherers, retain ancestry from the first phase, which is therefore still represented throughout the majority of human diversity in Africa today.Lipson Mark et al. Ancient Human DNA from Shum Laka (Cameroon) in the Context of African Population History // SAA 2019 Lithic assemblage and environmental variability The lithic assemblage in some of the late Pleistocene occupations at Shum Laka are unique in the presence of a quartz industry early than most other sites in the region. The presence of a microlithic quartz industry at Shum Laka, when combined with supporting evidence from other rockshelter and late Pleistocene sites in the Grasslands, is indicative of a more mobile population that exploited a variety of resources in the ecotonal landscape. This behavioral strategy is ascribed as an adaptation to common regional environmental changes during the late Pleistocene. It is well established that the late Pleistocene in northern Cameroon and the surrounding area was highly variable climatically. Particularly during the Last Glacial Maximum, refuge occupations by people would have been short-term and highly variable based on rapid, localized changes. Similar lithic assemblages and strategies as those found at Shum Laka have been delineated at other rockshelter sites in the area dating to the same period.

The mine was Britain's biggest coal producer. It closed in 2013 following a major fire. It was the last remaining colliery in the West Midlands. Mine Loading coal into a train at the rapid loader at Daw Mill Colliery, May 2008 Daw Mill mined a five-metre thick section of the Warwickshire Coalfield (known as the Warwickshire Thick) in the north of the county. It was owned and operated by UK Coal and in 2008 employed 680 people. The two shafts that served Daw Mill were first sunk between 1956 and 1959, and 1969 and 1971 respectively. The mine was a natural extension of the former collieries Kingsbury Colliery and Dexter Colliery, both of which have also closed. In 1983 an inclined tunnel linking underground workings with the surface was completed. This drift mining enabled Daw Mill to increase its production capacity as it removed the often time-consuming process of winding coal up the shafts. Daw Mill was the last surviving mine in a county that once had 20 operating collieries. In 2008 it excavated 3.25 million tonnes of coal, beating a 13-year-old record for annual output at a British coal mine set at Selby in North Yorkshire. Transport GB Railfreight 66717 hauling a coal train to Drax power station The colliery was situated on the Birmingham to Nuneaton Line, just east of the former Shustoke railway station. Trains were operated (post British Rail) mainly by EWS / DB Schenker but inroads were made by Fastline, Freightliner and GB Railfreight. Accidents Three men were killed at Daw Mill in mining accidents in 2006 and 2007. In 2011 UK Coal was fined ¬£1.2 million for safety breaches. On 22 February 2013, a major fire broke out underground, described as the worst underground blaze in Britain for 30 years. UK Coal and Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service confirmed that 92 workers were safely extracted. As of 7 March 2013 the fire had still not been fully extinguished. It was initially estimated that remedial work to the colliery could take between three and six months, making a return to production subject to a further review, resulting in the possible immediate closure of the mine. Closure On 14 March 2012 it was reported that UK Coal had begun a consultation process as part of plans for a company restructure which could see the closure of the mine in 2014. The Coal Authority stated in a 2012 report that if High Speed 2 were to be built, then Daw Mill would be forced to close due to associated development and the effects on local groundworks. On 7 March 2013 UK Coal announced the closure of the mine, due to the destructive fire which had extensively damaged it, with the plan to make most of the 650 staff redundant. Land Redevelopment plans In July 2013, the ownership of the Daw Mill site was transferred to property redevelopment firm Haworth Estates after UK Coal went into insolvency. Haworth subsequently submitted plans to North Warwickshire Borough Council to turn the land into a business park, which included proposals for an HGV depot, but withdrew their application in October 2014 after encountering opposition from local residents and councillors, who felt the scheme would be unworkable. One of their key objections was the volume of traffic that would be generated in the local area. Haworth said they would submit a revised proposal. A fresh set of plans were put forward in November. These included a \\"low-level rail hub\\", and a one third reduction in the size of the development. The proposals were further refined, and a second revised application made in July 2015. Having initially objected to the proposals on the grounds of the size of the road network that would be needed to support the new development, the Highways Department of Warwickshire County Council announced in October 2015 that it would now support the development. The decision prompted local MP Craig Tracey, whose North Warwickshire constituency includes the site, to write to the Department urging it to reconsider its stance. His letter highlighted the potential impact the business park would have on the nearby town of Coleshill, which he said would be adversely affected by the increase in traffic flow. North Warwickshire Borough Council's planning committee unanimously rejected Haworth's proposals on 3 November, citing fears that the development would cause \\"substantial\\" harm to the local green belt. Haworth announced that it would appeal the decision. The Court of Appeal ruled in 2018 that there could be no further appeals and that the land must be restored to green field within the greenbelt.

It is located in the city centre of Lisbon, in Cidade Universit√°ria, adjoining the Institute of Social Sciences (ICS) and Institute of Geography and Spatial Planning (IGOT) of the University of Lisbon. ISCTE was formerly called Instituto Superior de Ci√™ncias do Trabalho e da Empresa (in English, Higher Institute of Business and Labour Sciences), but its full name was dropped in 2009 when it became a university institute of foundational nature. As of today, ISCTE is widely considered a fully-fledged public research university despite its traditional designation, as reflected in national news coverage of the performance of Portuguese universities internationally and open, external assessments by international organisations. ISCTE Business School holds institutional accreditations from the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) and Association of MBAs (AMBA).List of AACSB-accredited business schools in Portugal (Source: AACSB website; accessed: 12.

Degree programmes ISCTE confers Bachelor's, Master's, Integrated Master's and PhD degrees and Habilitation in scientific areas such as Anthropology, Sociology, African Studies, History, Social Psychology, Political Science, Planning, Architecture, Economics, Finance, Business administration and Management, Human Resources, Marketing, Computer Science, Telecommunications Engineering, or Industrial Engineering. History ISCTE was established in Lisbon in 1972 as Instituto Superior de Ci√™ncias do Trabalho e da EmpresaThe ISCTE-IUL was created by the Decreto-Lei n¬∫ 522/72, of 15 December 1972 (pdf file). using the faculty and facilities of the Instituto de Estudos Sociais (Institute of Social Studies, founded in 1963) as a first step towards a new and innovative public university in Lisbon. Its present designation dates from 2009. In 1972, the first year of operation, 296 students matriculated at ISCTE: 219 in Economics, 66 in Business Administration (in Portuguese: Organiza√ß√£o e Gest√£o de Empresas) and 11 in Work Sciences (Ci√™ncias do Trabalho). From its creation, ISCTE was authorised to grant the bachelor's degree and the licenciatura degree, which was granted after the completion of four to five years of study that often required writing a final dissertation and thus was roughly equivalent to the current master's degree, instituted as part of the Bologna process. From 1983 onwards, ISCTE was also authorised to grant the master's degree, which was higher than the current Bologna process master's degree but still lower than a doctorate degree. What was to be the first college of a never completed larger projected university (due to the carnation revolution of 1974) always remained a non-integrated university college/institute. This situation was regularised in 1988, and from that date onwards, ISCTE grants all academic degrees, including Bachelor's, Master's and PhD degrees, Honorary doctorate and Habilitation (called Agrega√ß√£o in Portuguese). In 2000, a university organisational framework design for ISCTE was published. ISCTE is today part of both the Funda√ß√£o das Universidades Portuguesas (Foundation of Portuguese Universities) and the Conselho de Reitores das Universidades Portuguesas (Council of Rectors of Portuguese Universities). It is also one of the few public university education institutions in Portugal with a foundational nature,Decreto-Lei n.¬∫ 95/2009. other examples being the University of Porto, University of Aveiro and New University of Lisbon. It is known that, in 2002, the Council of Rectors of Portuguese Universities emitted the opinion that ISCTE should integrate the University of Lisbon (1911-2013), and in 2012, the University of Lisbon (before the merger with the Technical University of Lisbon) invited ISCTE to become a part of the bigger University, but ISCTE turned down both invitations.

History Sacred Oath was originally formed in 1985 by Rob Thorne and Pete Altieri while the two were classmates at Bethel High School. The band recorded their first demo in 1985 and quickly sold hundreds of them through local stores like Record Broker and Phoenix Records, developing a loyal following referred to as the \\"Oathbangers.\\" They signed a recording contract with the Mercenary Records label in 1986, shortly after recording their second demo Shadow Out Of Time. By then the band was becoming known internationally in an underground circuit. Members Rob Thorne, Pete Altieri, Glen Cruciani, and Kenny Evans recorded Sacred Oath's debut album A Crystal Vision in May 1987 at Presence Studios in East Haven CT, where Dave Obrizzo produced and Jon Russell engineered. The album was released in 1988 on vinyl, cassette, and CD and went on to garner cult-classic status as one of the pioneer efforts of the American power metal movement. The band disbanded in December 1988 before the album had caught on, due to creative disagreements and frustration with their failing record label. Mercenary Records and its parent label Celluloid Records went bankrupt soon after. Sentinel Steel Records reissued the debut album in 2001 through an exclusive agreement with the band. The band reformed and re- recorded the songs from that album, releasing them as A Crystal Revision in 2005. Rob and Kenny continued to record as Sacred Oath, issuing the critically acclaimed comeback album Darkness Visible in 2007 with all four original members. In 2008 they released a live album 'Till Death Do Us Part recorded during their tour of Europe. This album featured a new guitarist (Billy Smith) and a new bass player (Scott Waite), and established the band as back and fully active in the current music world. In 2009, the new lineup of Sacred Oath recorded their self-titled album, \\"Sacred Oath,\\" featuring their first single, \\"Counting Zeros.\\" Counting Zeros is BMI Work No. 10339363. The music video has featured on MTV2's \\"Headbangers Ball\\" along with an interview. However, after recording the album, bassist Scott Waite parted ways before playing any shows. New bass player, Brendan Kelleher, has taken his place and will be playing with Sacred Oath on their world tour. For the week of April 7, 2009 Sacred Oath's Counting Zeros was the \\"Discovery Download Pick Of The Week\\" on iTunes. In 2010, Sacred Oath Announced that they were coming out with a new album titled World On Fire. The album was released on October 5, 2010 after being recorded at Angel Thorne Music Company. In 2013, the band released a throwback album, titled Fallen, featuring songs from past band members. New songs were added as well, including the title track, Fallen, which paid homage to the Sandy Hook Killings in December 2012.

He became an officer cadet in the East India Company's Presidency armies just before the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The rebellion resulted in the British Crown extending direct rule to India, and Dickens continued to serve in what was now becoming the British Indian Army until his death. Biography Named after his godfather Walter Savage Landor, Walter Dickens was christened at St Marylebone parish church on 4 December 1841, after which Charles Dickens held a celebratory party. The guests included Elliotson, Landor, Maclise, Macready, Stanfield and Talfourd.A Charles Dickens Journal 1841 Walter was educated at Wimbledon. Nicknamed 'Young Skull' by his father,'The Family Tree of Charles Dickens' by Mark Charles Dickens Published by the Charles Dickens Museum, Doughty Street, London (2005) Walter Dickens showed early signs of aspiring to be an author like his father, but Charles Dickens instructed Walter's tutor to encourage him to not write, stating \\"The less he is encouraged to write the better, and the happier he will be.\\"'Charles Dickens' by Una Pope Hennessy Published by Read Books (2007) pg 389 Instead, through the influence of Angela Burdett- Coutts, Walter became a cadet in the East India Company, leaving England for India in 1857 aged 16 at the start of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. At this time there was no single unified army in India. Each of the three Presidencies of India had its own army, and, in addition, a limited number of British Army units were also stationed in India. After seeing Walter off at Southampton with his oldest son Charley, Charles Dickens was very upset for a few days but soon recovered and was satisfied that he had provided a career for his son, even though Walter was not suited to the life his father had chosen for him. Charles Dickens wrote, \\"A sad trial, thank God it is over. The dear boy bore it a great deal better than we could have hoped.\\"Hennessey, pg 389 Walter never returned home and his father was never to see him again. Calcutta; the grave is in Bhowanipore Military Cemetery in the same city Following the introduction of direct rule in India in the wake of the Rebellion, the armed forces were reorganized. A notice published in the London Gazette dated 1 March 1864 granted all those serving with \\"Her Majesty's Indian Forces on the 18th February 1861\\" rank in the British Army; Walter Dickens was amongst those listed with the rank of lieutenant. He served in the 26th Native Infantry Regiment, and was attached to the 42nd Regiment of Foot (The Black Watch) with that rank when he fell heavily into debt causing his health to break down. He was due to be invalided back to England but died of an aortic aneurysm on New Year's Eve at the Officers' Hospital in Calcutta in India. He was buried in the Bhowanipore Military Cemetery at Calcutta.'Dickens's grave rediscovered' reported in The New York Times 18 February 1911 In April 1987, a group of students from Jadavpur University, Calcutta, collected funds and moved the tombstone from the Bhowanipore War Cemetery to the South Park Street Cemetery. This was done as a tribute to the author, his father, and the tombstone is now placed among the memorials of the notable Europeans who died in the 18th century.'Kolkata's link with Charles Dickens' reported in The Hindu 8 February 2012 His father did not receive the news of Walter's death until his own birthday on 7 February 1864.Fred Kaplan, Dickens: A Biography (New York: William and Morrow, 1988), 457. .'The Life of Charles Dickens' by John Forster Published by Scribner (1907) pg 308 Later, he received Walter's unpaid bills.

Pietramala (\\"Bad rock\\") was the seat of the powerful family of the Tarlati, who came to prominence in the strife following Arezzo's decisive defeat at Campaldino (1289) as heads of the Ghibelline \\"Secchi\\" faction of Arezzo.In the fourteenth century Ghibelline Arezzo was divided between the Verdi and the less accommodating Secchi factions (Fran√ßois Tommy Perrens, Histoire de Florencevol. VI p 80). Pier Saccone's brother was Guido Tarlati, bishop and signore of Arezzo. Pier Saccone, during a fighting career that lasted to his final days, held for periods of time the lordships of Anghiari,Conquered by Guido, the fifgting bishop, and granted to Pier Saccone in 1327 (Pier Ludovico Occhini, Valle Tiberina da Montauto alle Balze). Arezzo, Citt√† di Castello, Sansepolcro, Bibbiena, Chiusi SubbianoIn 1338 Pier Saccone Tarlati surrendered Subbiano to the Fiorentine republic and Castiglion Fiorentino, in addition to numerous smaller strongholds.Condottieri di ventura: Pier Saccone di Pietramala; this article draws much of its factual material from this table. In 1312, with his brother Tarlatino Tarlatini, he was in the retinue of Henry of Luxembourg, Holy Roman Emperor at Rome. In August 1315 he participated at the battle of Montecatini, at the head of 140 gentlemen of Arezzo. In 1320 his reputation was assured through his acquisition of numerous castelli from Guido Novello da Polenta, the host of Dante in exile. In October 1323 he was invested with Citt√† di Castello. In February 1327 he paid court in Milan to Ludwig of Bavaria, King of Germany, who was crowned with the Iron Crown of Lombardy by his brother Guido, bishop of Arezzo,; in October that year, at the death of Guido, he was made Lord of the city, for the space of one year; however, after he attended the coronation in Rome of Ludwig as Holy Roman Emperor the following January and was excommunicated in March 1328 by John XXII along with the Emperor and the major members of his party, the Emperor formally invested him as Signore of Arezzo and Citt√† di Castello, in December, following the death of his brother, who had held the position for his lifetime. Pier Saccone's rule marked a rapid decline in the fortunes of Arezzo, which had reached their apogee under the bishop his brother.Robert Black, Benedetto Accolti and the Florentine Renaissance, (Cambridge University Press) 1985, \\"Arezzo in the early Renaissance\\" pp. 1-2. He took Sansepolcro in March 1329, after eight months of siege and unusually high casualties, but failed to take Cortona through a conspiracy, his favoured technique. That began a series of violent encounters with forces of Florence and Perugia that ended in March 1337, when he sold the signoria of Arezzo to the Florentines, for 42,800 florins and the back payment of his troops. Thus Ghibelline Arezzo passed for the first time under the power of Guelf Florence.Mons. Angelo Tafi , Arezzo la Repubblica: La Signoria dei Tarlati da Pietramala He and Tarlatino were received with great public honors in Florence and fought as allies of Florence in campaigns during the next years, until he failed in a Ghibelline attempt to seize power in Arezzo once more and was taken in chains to Florence, January 1342. In May Walter of Brienne, who controlled Florence, released him and restored to him his castello of Bibbiena. In June his partisans were foiled in another attempt on Arezzo, with much damage to palazzi and the city's walls and gates. In the spring of 1343, following the terms of a truce between Guelfs and Ghibbeline, Pier Saccone exchanged some recently acquired castelli for Rondine. That summer, with Brienne expelled from Florence, Pier Saccone moved again to take control of Arezzo, held by Buodelmonti, whio had the confidence of the Aretini. Pier Saccone ravaged the countryside round about. Capturing Castiglion Fiorentino and its rich treasury of 7,000 florins, Pier Saccone confiscated belongings and imprisoned men and women, some of whom were tortured to extort their goods. The following fighting season he turned against the forces of PerugiaHis rescue from the Perugini by the brothers Brandaglia at Olmo is commemorated in a late 16th-century fresco in the salone of Palazzo Brandaglia, Arezzo (illustration). and came to terms again with the Florentines in 1345; however, in 1351 he was in league with the Visconti, his old enemies the Ubertini and the Pazzi of Val d'Arno against the Florentine commune. He died at Bibbiena in 1356, and was succeeded by his son, Marco.

Originally written for the Amstrad CPC464, it was later sold for the Amstrad PCW series of word processors, for MS-DOS based PCs, the Atari ST, and the Commodore Amiga. A version was developed for the Acorn Archimedes and released in October 1990 which ran in full screen text mode, an accompanying note in the box mentioned Arnor's intention to develop a future release that would support operation in the RISC OS desktop with drag and drop capabilities, etc. but this was never developed. In 1991 Arnor were commissioned by Amstrad to develop a special version of Protext for the NC100 portable computer. This was included in the ROM on the NC100, NC150 and NC200. Translated versions of Protext were published in German, French and Swedish. The German version was known as Prowort due to a name conflict. After the closure of Arnor in 1995, the program was taken over by a group of enthusiasts including the original authors: Mark Tilley and Gavin Every; and relaunched with a new version for the PC. A companion database program Prodata was also sold. Since December 2008, Protext together with manuals and technical information has been freely downloadable, in formats for PC, Commodore Amiga and Atari ST. Protext was designed for speed and flexibility Protext web site and features the usual word processing features, such as a spell checker, thesaurus, auto-correction and good printer support. While later releases supported use of a mouse, the fastest editing with Protext would be using the keyboard, with all commonly used editing commands available with control key combinations. An unusual feature of Protext is its programmability. A mail merge programming language allows the user to input data from a text file or Prodata database. This is achieved by 'Stored commands' within the body of the text, an idea borrowed from the 'dot commands' of WordStar. Stored commands are similarly used to control formatting and layout of the text for printing. A preview mode showed the formatted layout but Protext did not display the fonts on screen. The macro record facility allowed a series of keystrokes to be 'learnt' and assigned to a single key or stored as an 'exec' file. For programmers, a useful feature is the easy manipulation of characters outside the alphanumeric range, in search strings or macros. Protext may be used to write a webpage, generate a webpage from stored data, or to create text for export and final formatting to a WYSIWYG word processor or DTP desktop publishing programme.

He has published 8 books and more than 2000 essays on photography and related subjects. He has lectured and taught internationally; his work has been translated into 21 languages and published in 31 countries. Early life and education Coleman was born in Brooklyn, New York on December 19, 1943. His parents were of Russian and Polish descent on the side of his father, Earl M. Coleman, and Scots on the side of his mother, n√©e Frances Louise Allan. During the McCarthy era (1951-3) his family moved to France, during which time he became bilingual francophone, and then briefly to England, before returning to the U.S. Aside from that interruption he was raised in Manhattan, where he went to school at, successively, P.S. 41 and P.S. 3 in Greenwich Village, Stuyvesant High School, and Hunter College (Bronx campus), now known as Lehman College. While at Hunter he worked on both the bi-campus newspaper, the Hunter Arrow, and the school literary magazine, Echo. In 1963 he published a one-act- play in Echo, titled \\"Midnight Mass,\\" that evoked the wrath of the conservative Catholic newspaper The Tablet (Diocese of Brooklyn), resulting in a public uproar that nearly ended up with the imposition of censorship on all CUNY publications. In 1963-64 he served as editor-in-chief of the Hunter Arrow. He received his B.A. in English Literature from Hunter in 1964, and was named to Sigma Tau Delta, the English honors society. Professional activity Coleman was the first photo critic for The New York Times, authoring 120 articles during his tenure.The Digital Evolution Visual Communication in the Electronic Age, Coleman, A.

It was one of the first standing committees established by Congress, having been created July 27, 1789 during the 1st Congress. History The enrollment process dates to the first years of Congress, with procedures to ensure its integrity initially laid out in Jefferson's Manual: \\"When a bill has passed both Houses of Congress, the House last acting on it notifies its passage to the other, and delivers the bill to the Joint Committee on Enrollment.\\"House Rules and Manual, ¬ß 573, 575 From 1789 to 1876, the House and Senate had joint rules with similar requirements in relation to enrollment. In particular, these rules directed the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Secretary of the Senate to enroll bills and mandated a review (and any corrections, if necessary) by a joint committee, which would then report to the respective chambers. In 1876, the rules for the joint committee lapsed, and the Committee on Enrolled Bills reverted to separate House and Senate standing committees. The committee continued to be referred to as a \\"joint committee,\\" even though both the House and Senate committees separately supervised the enrolling of bills originated in its own house. Under the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 the functions of the Committee on Enrolled Bills were incorporated into those of the House Administration Committee. This lasted until the beginning of the 107th Congress, when jurisdiction over enrollment was transferred to the House Clerk and laid out in House Rules. The Senate transferred authority over the enrollment process to the Secretary of the Senate in 1945 upon adoption of S.Res. 64 (79th Congress), and is now incorporated in Senate Rule XIV. Jurisdiction The Joint Committee on Enrolled Bills was established with the responsibility for the enrollment of engrossed bills. The enacting resolution which created the committee stated: > After a bill shall have passed both Houses, it shall be duly enrolled on > Parchment by the Clerk of the House of Representatives or the Secretary of > the Senate, as the bill may have originated in one or the other House, > before it shall be presented to the President of the United States. . . . > When bills are enrolled they shall be examined by a joint committee for that > purpose, who shall carefully compare the enrollment with the engrossed bills > as passed in the two Houses, and, correcting any errors that may be > discovered in the enrolled bills, make their report forthwith to their > respective Houses. Journal of the House of Representatives of the United > States, 1st Cong., 1st sess., July 27, 1789, p. 67. An enrolled bill or resolution is the form of a measure finally agreed to by both chambers of Congress. This is different than an engrossed measure, which refers to the form a bill takes when it first passes its chamber of origin, including any amendments, before being referred to the second chamber for concurrence. Today, enrollment occurs in the chamber where the measure originated and is carried out by enrolling clerks under the supervision of the House Clerk and the Secretary of the Senate. Enrolled bills and joint resolutions are signed by the presiding officers of each chamber (or their designees), as required by , and are presented to the President by the House Clerk or Secretary of the Senate, depending on the chamber of origination.

The center runs afterschool and summer programs to provide children of all ages free tutoring and academic support as well as access to extracurricular activities such as basketball and art. The center currently serves approximately 80 students. History Duncan started the center in 1961 after a friend at the Kenwood United Church of Christ asked her to teach Bible school to nine girls, ages 8 to 10, at the church and she discovered none of them could read. Over the years, the tutoring program has moved around to several different neighborhood churches and is now situated inside Jackie Robinson Elementary School in North Kenwood District. Duncan faced troubles early on because of her novel position as a Caucasian starting an afterschool program in an almost completely African American community. During Arne Duncan's confirmation hearing to become Secretary of Education, he said: > \\"One of my earliest memories was in -- in -- I was about 6 years old, in > 1970, the church that we were working out of was firebombed by the > Blackstone Rangers. And I remember salvaging what we could from the church > and walking down the block to another church and carrying crates of books > and asking that -- that minister to allow us to come in and work, and having > to deal with that. Our lives were threatened. My mother's life was > threatened. I remember leaving work one night and a guy coming by and saying > if we came back the next day we'd be killed. And so we had an interesting > conversation that -- that night at home at dinner. Our dinnertime > conversations may be a little bit different than other families. And we > tried to figure out what to do and really decided that you can't -- you > can't run. And once you start running, you know, you'll be chancing your > shadow eventually. So we showed up the next day and luckily he didn't.\\" Duncan's three children, Arne, Sarah and Owen, spent much of their childhoods at the center. Other alumni of the center include Oscar nominee Michael Clarke Duncan, and top IBM engineer Kerrie Holley. Program overview The children's center provides academic help to primarily low-income African American children living on the South Side of Chicago. According to the center's website: > \\"SDCC further recognizes that the needs of its children are deeper than > educational, that many have experienced and witnessed violence in their > neighborhoods and homes leading to deep anger and subsequent behavioral > problems. The Center, through a range of programmatic components, aims to > support the whole child, fostering academic achievement and emotional and > social well being. To this end, the first part of the day is focused on > academics with the children participating in small reading groups, intensive > one-on-one tutoring, small group tutoring, and group discussions. After all > the children receive a warm nutritious meal, they participate in various > activities focused more on social and emotional growth.

It was released at the launch of the Nintendo DSi and DSiWare service on April 5, 2009 in North America. Gameplay The game requires players to line up blocks in rows of 3 or more in order to allow their diver to delve deeper into the ocean. This occurs as they move blocks of various sizes (1 x 2, 2 x 1, or 2 x 2) horizontally into a column of coloured blocks. As players move blocks in from one side, they push blocks out of the other side. They can move these blocks up and down the column, as well as rotating their colours configuration, in order to create matches of coloured blocks within the column.Pocket Gamer: Art Style: AQUITE (DSiWare) As the diver progresses he wil slowly begin to lose his air supply. The player has to refill the diver's airmsupply by clearing rows of blocks quicker or finding and clearing a row of 3 special blocks that will appear randomly as the game progresses. Darkness falls from the top of the screen as time goes on too, which makes it more difficult to make matches. There are two modes to select from in the game, Timed Dive and Free Dive. Timed Dive requires players to clear blocks until the diver reaches a certain depth before he runs out of air, at that point the level will end and the diver descends to the next stage. Free Dive is a never-ending puzzle mode that tests how deep the player's diver can go before he runs out of air. There is a relaxing Aquarium mode that when unlocked displays a virtual aquarium on the top screen. Development Aquario was announced for the DSiWare service on October 2, 2008 at a Nintendo conference alongside the reveal of the service. It was eventually released on December 24, 2008 on the DSiWare's launch. It was announced for an English release in both North America and Europe alongside several other DSiWare games on February 18, 2009. It was developed by Skip Ltd. and published by Nintendo.

The NCCS provides resources for calculation and simulation in fields including astrophysics, materials science, and climate research to users from government, academia, and industry who have many of the largest computing problems in science. The OLCF‚Äôs flagship supercomputer, the IBM AC922 Summit, is supported by advanced data management and analysis tools. The center hosted the Cray XK7 Titan system, one of the most powerful scientific tools of its time, from 2012 through its retirement in August 2019. The same year, construction began for Frontier, which is slated to debut as the OLCF‚Äôs first exascale system in 2021.  History  On December 9, 1991, Congress signed the High-Performance Computing Act (HPCA) of 1991, created by Senator Al Gore. HPCA proposed a national information infrastructure to build communications networks and databases and also called for proposals to build new high- performance computing facilities to serve science. On May 24, 1992, ORNL was awarded a high-performance computing research center called the Center for Computational Sciences, or CCS, as part of HPCA. ORNL also received a 66-processor, serial #1 Intel Paragon XP/S 5 for code development the same year. The system had a peak performance of 5 gigaflops (5 billion floating- point operations per second). Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) joined with three other national laboratories and seven universities to submit the Partnership in Computational Science (PICS) proposal to the US Department of Energy as part of the High-Performance Computing and Communications Initiative. With the High-End Computing Revitalization Act of 2004, CCS was tasked with carrying out the Leadership Computing Facility (LCF) Project at ORNL with the goal of developing and installing a petaflops-speed supercomputer by the end of 2008. The center officially changed its name from the Center for Computational Sciences to NCCS the same year. On December 9, 2019, Georgia Tourassi‚Äìwho previously served as the director of ORNL's Health Data Sciences Institute and as group leader for ORNL‚Äôs Biomedical Sciences, Engineering, and Computing Group‚Äìwas appointed to director of the NCCS, succeeding James Hack.  Previous Systems  Intel Paragons  The creation of the CCS in 1992 ushered in a series of Intel Paragon computers, including: * Intel Paragon XP/S 5 (1992): The Intel Paragon XP/S 5 provided 128 GP compute nodes arranged in a 16 row by 8 column rectangular mesh consisting of one 8 by 8 group of 16MB nodes and one 8 by 8 group of 32MB nodes. Also available were four 128MB MP compute nodes in a 2 row by 2 column mesh. In addition, there was the128 MB MP boot node, four 32MB GP service nodes and six I/O nodes, five of which were connected to 4.8 GB RAID disks and the sixth to a 16 GB RAID disk. This provided a total of 40 GB of system disk space. * Intel Paragon XP/S 35 (1992): The Intel Paragon XP/S 35 provided 512 compute processors arranged in a 16 row by 32 column rectangular mesh. In addition, there were five service nodes and 27 I/O nodes each connected to a 4.8 GB RAID disk. This provided a total of 130 GB of system disk space. Each of the five service nodes and the 512 compute nodes had 32MB of memory. * Intel Paragon XP/S 150 (1995): The fastest computer in the world at the time of its delivery to ORNL, the Intel Paragon XP/S 150 provided 1,024 nodes arranged in a 16 row by 64 column rectangular mesh. These were MP nodes, which meant there were two compute processors per node. Most of the nodes had 64MB, but 64 of the nodes had 128MB. In addition, there were five service nodes and 127 I/O nodes (119 regular I/O nodes and 4 high-performance SCSI-16 I/O nodes) each connected to a 4.8 GB RAID disk. This provided a total of 610 GB of system disk space.  Eagle (2000‚Äì2005)  Eagle was a 184-node IBM RS/6000 SP operated by the Computer Science and Mathematics Division of ORNL. It had 176 Winterhawk-II ‚Äúthin‚Äù nodes, each with four 375 MHz Power3-II processors and 2GB of memory. Eagle also had eight Winterhawk-II ‚Äúwide‚Äù nodes - each with two 375 MHz Power3-II processors and 2 GB of memory‚Äîfor use as filesystem servers and other infrastructure tasks. Eagle‚Äôs estimated computational power was greater than 1 teraflop in the compute partition.  Falcon (2000)  Falcon was a 64-node Compaq AlphaServer SC operated by the CCS and acquired as part of an early-evaluation project. It had four 667 MHz Alpha EV67 processors with 2 GB of memory per node and 2 TB of Fiber Channel disk attached, resulting in an estimated computational power of 342 gigaflops.  Cheetah (2001‚Äì2008)  Cheetah was a 4.5 TF IBM pSeries System operated by the CCS. The compute partition of Cheetah included 27 p690 nodes, each with thirty-two 1.3 GHz Power4 processors. The login and I/O partitions together included 8 p655 nodes, each with four 1.7 GHz Power4 processors. All nodes were connected via IBM‚Äôs Federation interconnect. The Power4 memory hierarchy consisted of three levels of cache. The first and second levels were on the Power4 chip (two processors to a chip). Level-1 instruction cache was 128 KB (64 KB per processor) and the data cache was 64 KB (32 KB per processor.) The level-2 cache was 1.5 MB shared between the two processors. The level 3 cache was 32 MB and was off-chip. There were 16 chips per node, or 32 processors. Most of Cheetah‚Äôs compute nodes had 32 GB of memory. Five had 64 GB of memory and two had 128 GB of memory. Some of the nodes in Cheetah had approximately 160 GB of local disk space that could be used as temporary scratch space. In June 2002, Cheetah was ranked the eighth-fastest computer in the world, according to TOP500, the semi-annual list of the world's top supercomputers.  Ram (2003‚Äì2007)  Ram was an SGI Altix supercomputer provided as a support system for the NCCS.

By contrast, the first supercomputer at ORNL, the Cray XMP installed in 1985, had one-millionth the memory of the SGI Altix.  Phoenix (OLCF-1) (2003‚Äì2008)  Phoenix was a Cray X1E provided as a primary system in NCCS. The original X1 was installed in 2003 and went through several upgrades, arriving at its final configuration in 2005. From October 2005 until 2008, it provided almost 17 million processor-hours. The system supported more than 40 large projects in research areas including climate, combustion, high energy physics, fusion, chemistry, computer science, materials science, and astrophysics. At its final configuration, Phoenix had 1,024 multistreaming vector processors (MSPs). Each MSP had 2 MB of cache and a peak computation rate of 18 gigaflops. Four MSPs formed a node with 8 GB of shared memory. Memory bandwidth was very high, roughly half the cache bandwidth. The interconnect functioned as an extension of the memory system, offering each node direct access to memory on other nodes at high bandwidth and low latency.  Jaguar (OLCF-2) (2005‚Äì2012)  Jaguar began as a 25-teraflop Cray XT3 in 2005. Later, it was upgraded to an XT4 containing 7,832 compute nodes, each containing a quad-core AMD Opteron 1354 processor running at 2.1 GHz, 8 GB of DDR2-800 memory (some nodes used DDR2-667 memory), and a SeaStar2 router. The resulting partition contained 31,328 processing cores, more than 62 TB of memory, more than 600 TB of disk space, and a peak performance of 263 teraflops (263 trillion floating point operations per second). In 2008, Jaguar was upgraded to a Cray XT5 and became the first system to run a scientific application at a sustained petaflop. By the time of its ultimate transformation into Titan in 2012, Jaguar contained nearly 300,000 processing cores and had a theoretical performance peak of 3.3 petaflops. Jaguar had 224,256 x86-based AMD Opteron processor cores and operated with a version of Linux called the Cray Linux Environment. From November 2009 until November 2010, Jaguar was the world's most powerful computer.  Hawk (2006‚Äì2008)  Hawk was a 64-node Linux cluster dedicated to high-end visualization. Hawk was installed in 2006 and was used as the Center‚Äôs primary visualization cluster until May 2008 when it was replaced by a 512-core system named Lens. Each node contained two single-core Opteron processors and 2 GB of memory. The cluster was connected by a Quadrics Elan3 network, providing high-bandwidth and low-latency communication. The cluster was populated with two flavors of NVIDIA graphics cards connected with AGP8x: 5900 and QuadroFX 3000G.

An additional node contained 4 dual-core AMD processors and 64 GB of memory. The system was configured with a 13 TB Lustre file system for scratch space.  Eugene (2008‚Äì2011)  Eugene was a 27-teraflop IBM Blue Gene/P System operated by NCCS. It provided approximately 45 million processor-hours yearly for ORNL staff and for the promotion of research collaborations between ORNL and its core university partner members. The system consisted of 2,048 850Mhz IBM quad-core 450d PowerPC processors and 2 GB of memory per each node. Eugene had 64 I/O nodes; each submitted job was required to use at least one I/O node. This means that each job consumed a minimum of 32 nodes per execution. Eugene was officially decommissioned in October 2011. However, on December 13 of the same year, a portion of Eugene‚Äôs hardware was donated to Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF) at Argonne National Laboratory.  Eos (2013‚Äì2019)  Eos was a 736-node Cray XC30 cluster with a total of 47.104 TB of memory. Its processor was the Intel Xeon E5-2670. It featured 16 I/O service nodes and 2 external login nodes. Its compute nodes were organized in blades. Each blade contained 4 nodes. Every node had 2 sockets with 8 physical cores each. Intel‚Äôs HyperThreading (HT) Technology allowed each physical core to work as 2 logical cores so each node could function as if it had 32 cores. In total, the Eos compute partition contained 11,776 traditional processor cores (23,552 logical cores with HT Technology enabled). Eos provided a space for tool and application porting, small scale jobs to prepare capability runs on Titan, as well as software generation, verification, and optimization.  Titan (OLCF-3) (2012‚Äì2019)  Titan was a hybrid-architecture Cray XK7 system with a theoretical peak performance exceeding 27,000 trillion calculations per second (27 petaflops). It contained both advanced 16-core AMD Opteron CPUs and NVIDIA Kepler graphics processing units (GPUs). This combination allowed Titan to achieve 10 times the speed and 5 times the energy efficiency of its predecessor, the Jaguar supercomputer, while using only modestly more energy and occupying the same physical footprint. Titan featured 18,688 compute nodes, a total system memory of 710 TB, and Cray‚Äôs high-performance Gemini network. Its 299,008 CPU cores guided simulations and the accompanying GPUs handled hundreds of calculations simultaneously. The system provided decreased time to solution, increased complexity of models, and greater realism in simulations. In November 2012, Titan received the Number 1 position on the TOP500 supercomputer list. After 7 years of service, Titan was decommissioned in August 2019 to make room for the Frontier supercomputer.  Current Systems   Spider  The OLCF‚Äôs center-wide Lustre file system, called Spider, is the operational work file system for most OLCF computational resources. As an extremely high-performance system, Spider has over 20,000 clients, providing 32 PB of disk space, and it can move data at more than 1 TB/s.

Gestalt van Goethe tot Gibson: theorie√´n over het zien van schoonheid en orde. Utrecht: Universiteit Utrecht (dissertation). In the last two books he explored the crossroads of artistic and scientific experiments with visual perception. From the mid-nineties he focussed on multisensory perception and synesthesia in art and science, resulting in the bestselling Tussen zinnen in the Netherlands and the internationally acclaimed The Hidden Sense.Lists of reviews of Tussen zinnen and The Hidden Sense. Editor Van Campen was editor of the Leonardo online bibliography Synesthesia in Art and Science and founder and web editor of Synesthetics Netherlands, a non-profit organization, hosting e.g. the Netherlands web community of synesthesia. He started editing during his studies as an editor of Psychopolis, an academic magazine of theoretical psychology. After graduation, he compiled a series of bibliographies on health care for the Netherlands Institute of Primary Care (NIVEL). From 1994-2000 he was editor and later editor-in-chief of the scientific journal Psychology & Maatschappij (Psychology & Society), an interdisciplinary social scientific journal that was based in the critical psychology movement. Scientific researcher He has been affiliated with the Netherlands Institute for Social Research/SCP as Chief Scientific Strategist, the Windesheim University of Applied Sciences as an associate lector (2012 - 2017), and with Synesthetics Netherlands as an independent researcher and consultant. He obtained a M.A. in psychology with minors in philosophy and cultural studies, and a Ph.D. in history of art (and psychology) at Utrecht University, the Netherlands. During the past two decades he has been involved in two lines of research: perception and quality of life. Fields of interest Perception In his Ph.D. study that resulted in the book Gestalt from Goethe to Gibson (1994), van Campen linked history of art to history of science. He showed that the apparent rise of Gestalt psychology in perception research in the 1910s had its roots in late 19th century art history in Germany. The study was done in the context of the interdisciplinary Working Group Iconic Processes, including art historians, psychologists, physicists and anthropologists from several Dutch universities. For a wider audience he wrote the book Pictorial Illusions (1994), exploring the links between artistic and scientific experiments with visual perception since the Renaissance. The book received attention from national television and art and science festivals. After finishing his thesis, his interests moved to the perception of music. Soon after, he found the intriguing phenomenon of synesthesia on the crossroads of music and visual art. With artist and color expert Clara Froger, he started a series of experiments of synesthesia, combining scientific and artistic methods of investigation.Netherlands Color Synethesia (NeCoSyn) project. The results were published nationally and internationally.Campen, Cretien van & Froger, Clara (2003). Personal Profiles of Color Synesthesia: Developing a Testing Method for Artists and Scientists. Leonardo vol. 36, nr. 4, pp. 291-294.Campen, Cretien van & Froger, Clara (2001). Helderheid, verzadiging en toon van kleursynesthesie. Kleurenvisie, zomer.Campen, Cretien van & Froger, Clara (1999).

The experiments became popular and got attention from hundreds of synesthetes in the Netherlands, mediated by articles and items in the Dutch media, which resulted in the Netherlands Web Community of Synesthesia and a number of workshops and conferences on synesthesia in art and science. The demand for information on synesthesia resulted in the book Tussen zinnen. The new perspective on synesthesia, developed in this book in collaboration with synesthetes, artists and scientists in the Netherlands, led to the publication of The Hidden Sense: Synesthesia in Art and Science by the MIT Press. Since then, van Campen has been consulted on synesthesia and the senses in a number of national and international projects, among them Art Education Belgium (RASA), Unilever UK and Rabobank Netherlands. His research into synesthesia has taken the direction of autobiographical memory. In his latest book The Proust Effect, he explores tales and studies on sense memories (e.g. the Madeleine story by Marcel Proust).

Formation Formed at the University at Buffalo, the band recorded and released 4 CDs and 2 cassettes, and has had songs placed in multiple Motion Picture Soundtracks and National TV shows, most recently on Spike TV's \\"Top Dead Center\\" program. Members The band members are Tim Bryant (guitar, vocals), Tom Greier (guitar, vocals), Paul Zacks (bass), Dan \\"Scary\\" Braun (drums). Zacks, who died in 2015, had previously been a member of the Rochester, New York‚Äìbased band The Elephant Balls Experience. Club scene Formed in 1989, Scary Chicken passed through the Buffalo college circuit and its growing club scene, to become one of the area's most popular alternative bands. Scary Chicken played extensively in the eastern U.S. throughout the 1990s, primarily between New York City, Chicago, Toronto, and Tennessee. Releases Scary Chicken released a series of self-produced and released CDs, including Something Anymore and Flanny EP, before being discovered in 1994 at New York City's Lion's Den club by Cevin Soling of Xemu Records. Tours The band was the first to tour Hard Rock Cafe clubs from Boston to Miami, and has shared the stage with Weezer, Sloan, Beck, Ben Folds 5, Goo Goo Dolls, moe., Blue Rodeo and members of Moonboot Lover now playing as Soulive. The band was invited to play several large outdoor \\"EdgeFest\\" concerts, and was selected for Buffalo's Thursday at the Square concert series. Press Excerpts From the Band's press kit: The Hoya, Washington D.C., September 27, 1996 \\"... Listening to \\"Is That Your Beer?\\" probably makes one wonder whether Scary Chicken's sound is amicable listening material for a night out dining with your loved ones. Many of the album's tracks contain hard guitar progressions that would probably sens plates flying off tables. For the Washington, D.C. show, however, they used an acoustic set that made the tracks come off much lighter. \\"The band opened the set with \\"If I Showered,\\" which they released last month and should soon see time on major radio stations. The next song was \\"Can't Stop It\\", one of the songs that was written by Greier. This song, like most of those written by Greier on the album, is softer‚Äîmore \\"chick rockish\\" according to Greier. The other songs on the album were written by Bryant who Greier says writes \\"witty and insane\\" pieces. \\"Some of Bryant's highlights include \\"Favorite Channel\\", a powerful, simultaneously poignant love song that was inspired by a remote control button, and \\"Road to Hell,\\" which he wrote because of his father's favorite expression: \\"The road to Hell is paved with good intentions.\\" \\"This tour shows that Scary Chicken will be playing for larger audiences in the very near future.\\" Democrat and Chronicle, Rochester, N.Y. June 27, 1996 \\"Prank calls and beer guzzling: It's all part of playing Chicken.\\" Artvoice, Buffalo, N.Y. December 4, 1995 \\"For anyone who has seen Scary Chicken, you know that these guys are well humoured and quick- witted fellas that take what they can get, and laugh about it. \\"The knack for songwriting that exists among Tim Bryant, Tom Greier, Paul Zacks, and Dan \\"Scary\\" Braun reaches mammoth proportions. This band has accomplished so much through its determination, hard work, and consistent practicing schedule, yet they aren't getting the attention that the Goo Goo Dolls or Ani DiFranco have received. \\"With two singers, Scary Chicken lays down sweet harmonies and rocking melodies over sometimes heavy guitar licks and interesting chord progressions. With songs like \\"Furburger\\", \\"Nuke The Whales\\", and \\"Tip Your Bartender\\" also included in Scary Chicken's repertoire, the fun, cynicism, and wit sometimes catches you off guard. This is what makes the band great though: great music combined with fun, zanyness (Tim Bryant has been known to ask the audience if he can spit down someone's throat for fifty cents!), mystery (Paul had his car‚Äîor should I say, \\"grocery-getter\\"‚Äîstolen right before Scary Chicken was to hit the stage at Broadway Joe's a while back!), and atmosphere. \\"As Scary Chicken is symbolic of the Buffalo Music scene, I have hopes and confidence that the chickens are on to bigger and better things. Many of their fans are die-hards and new people are always impressed. The Buffalo News June 16, 1995 Local Record Pick \\"Is That Your Beer?\\" by Scary Chicken Buffalo band on Xemu Records, an independent label out of New York‚Ä¶The Chicken cooks with the jangling guitar rock on the opening cut, \\"If I Showered\\". The beat picks up on the hard driving \\"Cementhead\\". Scary Chicken adds a touch of country pop to \\"Can't Stop It\\" and displays a tough edge on \\"Found\\". The group pounds away with power on \\"Locked Up\\". This album proves the band is ready for the big time with a national release.\\" Night-Life Magazine June 5, 1995 \\"Scary Chicken, and 11-song CD called \\"Is That Your Beer?\\" with live introductions, occasional crow noise, an intermission and a secret 33rd track. \\"The spoken intros give the impression that this might have been recorded live in concert, an impression reinforced by the rawness of the sound. A check of the liner notes, however, reveals that all this seemingly messy spontaneity was actually laid down in a studio.

It is increasingly a task of management accounting. IT cost transparency solutions integrate financial information such as labor, software licensing costs, hardware acquisition and depreciation, data center facilities charges, from general ledger systems and combines that with operational data from ticketing, monitoring, asset management, and project portfolio management systems to provide a single, integrated view of IT costs by service, department, GL line item and project. In addition to tracking cost elements, IT Cost Transparency tracks utilization, usage and operational performance metrics in order to provide a measure of value or ROI. Costs, budgets, performance metrics and changes to data points are tracked over time to identify trends and the impact of changes to underlying cost drivers in order to help managers address the key drivers in escalating IT costs and improve planning. IT cost transparency combines elements of activity based costing, business intelligence, operational monitoring and performance dashboards. It provides the system on which to implement ITIL v3 Financial Management guidelines to assist with Financial Management for IT services and is closely related to IT Service Management.  Capabilities  While specific solutions vary, capabilities can include: * Simplified or automated collection of key cost driver data * An allocation or cost modeling interface * Custom reporting and analysis of unit cost drivers, including CIO dashboards * Ability to track operational metrics such as utilization, service levels, support tickets along with cost *Bill of IT reports for chargeback or service allocation to Lines of Business * Forecast and budget tracking versus actual and over time * Hypothetical scenario planning for new project ROI analysis * Cost benchmarking against industry averages or common metrics * Self-service portal for employees to manage assigned assets  Analysts' take  ‚ÄúGlobalization, consumerization, new competitors and new service models are radically ‚Äòchanging the shape of IT‚Äô. IT leaders must develop greater transparency into the costs, utilization and operations of their IT services in order to optimize their IT investments and evolve from being technology managers to being stewards of business technology.‚Äù -- Barbara Gomolski, Research Vice President, Gartner \\"By making these costs transparent, the IT organization can fundamentally change the way business units consume IT resources, drive down total enterprise IT costs, and focus on IT spending that delivers real business value. The CIO who leads this change can usher in a new era of strategic IT management--and true partnership with the business.\\" ‚ÄîAndrew M. Appel, Neeru Arora, and Raymond Zenkich. McKinsey & Company. \\"Companies can get an understanding of the best candidates for virtualization or consolidation, for instance, and further reduce the cost of resources. IT organizations consistently try to become more efficient, and this type of detailed information enables visibility, billing and chargeback in the future,\\" -- CIOs seek IT cost transparency in 2010 by Denise Dubie, comment on IT cost optimization by Yisrael Dancziger, president and CEO of Digital Fuel  IT Cost Breakdown  The average IT budget has the following breakdown: 25% ‚Äì personnel costs (internal) 29% ‚Äì software costs (external/purchasing category) 26% ‚Äì hardware costs (external/purchasing category) 14% ‚Äì costs of external service providers (external/services) This is confirmed by independent research from McKinsey and the Sand-Hill Group. In addition to the considerations above about the current volume of software asset costs, even more important is their growth ‚Äì their absolute growth (in EUR) and relative growth (relative to growth of other costs in the IT budget). Software asset costs are growing, endogenously and exogenously: * Endogenous growth ‚Äì Recent technology shifts and IT cost reduction initiatives, e.g. server virtualization, remote desktops and cloud computing, have delivered flexibility and security in operations and a cost advantage on the hardware/infrastructure side ‚Äì but have generated increased software demand, and thus supplementary costs, on the software asset side. * Exogenous growth ‚Äì Software vendors have transformed the process of discovering incompliance into a business model. The technology shift to virtualized/cloud environments has provided the right platform. Nowadays, most vendors have increased the complexity licensing requirements, taking into account more attributes for more licensing metrics. They have accelerated the pace of change and created more pitfalls, thus increasing the level of software licensing expertise required in order to remain compliant.

POGIL was devised in 1994 to better teach general chemistry. Today, POGIL is implemented in a wide range of subjects in more than 1,000 American high schools and colleges.  Activities  There are two crucial aspects to the design of a POGIL activity. First, sufficient appropriate information must be provided for the initial \\"Exploration\\" so that students are able to develop the desired concepts. Second, the guiding questions must be sequenced in a carefully constructed manner so that not only do students reach the appropriate conclusion, but at the same time various process and learning skills are implemented and developed. Typically the first few questions build on students' prior knowledge and direct attention to the information provided by the model. This is followed by questions designed to help promote the recognitions of relationships and patterns in the data, leading toward some concept development. The final questions may involve applying the concepts to new situations and generalizing students' new knowledge and understanding. Thus, POGIL activities follow the structure of the learning cycle of exploration, concept invention and application, and has a strong basis in constructivism.  Classroom implementation  Students in a POGIL classroom may work in small groups of three or four to tackle a specifically designed activity. Each student is assigned a role, such as a task manager, recorder, spokesperson or reflector. The instructor acts as a facilitator who listens to the discussions between students, intervening at appropriate times to help facilitate student learning. In their groups, students may discuss and analyze problems and their answers to questions that are crafted to help lead them to consider the general ideas in question and to construct their own understanding of important concepts. As they formulate their ideas, they may share their understanding and discoveries with other groups. Rather than having the instructor begin class by defining terms and laying out concepts, students work actively to master material and formulate a deeper understanding of content. Built into the experience is the support of a variety of important process skills, including communication, teamwork, and critical thinking, which translates to a more complete understanding of the entire concept, and a lasting understanding of the material.  The POGIL Project  The teaching method of POGIL is supported by the POGIL Project, a non-profit 501(c)3 organization based in Lancaster, PA. The POGIL Project has earned numerous grants from the National Science Foundation and other sources. The POGIL Project is based on an understanding of the important components of an effective faculty development structure. The project trains faculty to implement POGIL in their classrooms, and creates new POGIL materials through an multitude of opportunities including workshops, on-site visits, and consultancies. The project also hosts an annual POGIL National Meeting to grow and expand the POGIL community. The current director of The POGIL Project is Rick Moog, a Professor of Chemistry at Franklin & Marshall College. Dr. Moog has used POGIL materials in his teaching since 1994, and is a co-author of POGIL materials for both general and physical chemistry.

History The first Pegasus launch to use Stargazer was conducted on 27 June 1994, and was the maiden flight of the Pegasus-XL. Previous launches used the NASA-operated Boeing NB-52B Balls 8, which was also used for four subsequent launches, as the original Pegasus could not be launched from Stargazer due to clearance issues. A modified version, the Pegasus-H, was introduced to rectify this. Stargazer was also used for captive tests and transportation of the X-34 hypersonic research aircraft; however, drop tests used Balls 8. Orbital Sciences also offer the aircraft for research flights.

In 2015, Stargazer was re-painted to reflect Orbital Sciences' merger with Alliant Techsystems. On 15 December 2016, Stargazer successfully launched CYGNSS on behalf of NASA on its second attempt. The first attempt on 12 December was scrubbed due to issues with the hydraulic system responsible for separating the Pegasus rocket from the launch aircraft. Stargazer launched the Ionospheric Connection Explorer on 11 October 2019. The launch was originally scheduled for June 2017 but was scrubbed when an anomalous piece of vehicle data was observed during a ferry flight. The data was related to the rudder position of the Pegasus XL rocket and was observed during a routine in-flight vehicle health check The launch was delayed multiple times throughout 2017 and 2018 and 2019, finally occurring October 11, 2019.

Background  St. Xavier's School, Gandhinagar, is run by the Jesuits. St. Francis Xavier was the first Jesuit to come to India 450 years ago, and schools throughout India are named after him. In the late 60s, many governmental officials had their children in St. Xavier's High School, Loyola Hall, Ahmedabad, or in Mt. Carmel, Ahmedabad. When the capital was moved to Gandhinagar the Government of Gujarat assisted in the founding of Xavier's High School there and also assists with salaries for teachers, Beginning in a government building in Sector 20, in 1982 the school shifted to a sprawling campus in Sector 8, with football fields, a cricket ground, two basketball courts, a full-sized skating rink, a canteen, and a tree-filled and environmentally friendly campus. The students come from all strata of society and the school is affiliated to the Gujarat Secondary Board of education running both Gujarati and English medium streams. Vision The school caters mostly to children of Government officials working in Sachivalayathe. It follows the Gujarat State Board syllabus and has both the mediums running in the school ‚Äì English and Gujarati. It aims to educate the well-rounded person, of service to others. The motto of the school in Latin is Ateneris Impende Laborem, which means that a child from an early age should apply himself/herself to hard work. In the year 1996/1997 the Vedruna Sisters (Carmelites of Charity) joined the school to look after the primary and pre- primary sections. The school has always secured more than 95% results at the Board examinations.

Construction and service, 1910-1918 Howick Hall was built as the commercial cargo ship SS Howick Hall in 1910 at Port Glasgow, Scotland, by the William Hamilton Company. In 1914 she was sold to the United States Steel Products Company of New York City. She was sold to the Isthmian Line in 1915. In September 1917, the United States Army acquired Howick Hall for use as a cargo ship during World War I. United States Navy service, 1918-1919 The U.S. Navy acquired Howick Hall from the U.S. Army on 24 August 1918. Assigned Identification Number (Id. No.) 1303, she was commissioned at Baltimore, Maryland, the same day as USS Howick Hall with Lieutenant Commander Gust E. Jonsson in command. Assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service, Howick Hall loaded cargo at Baltimore and joined a convoy at New York City. From there she steamed to St. Nazaire, France, which she reached on 30 September 1918. She discharged her cargo and returned to Baltimore, where she arrived on 31 October 1918. It proved to be her only wartime voyage in U.S. Navy service, as World War I ended on 11 November 1918 before she next put to sea. Howick Halls second and final voyage in U.S. Navy service began at Newport News, Virginia, where she loaded cargo for Le Verdon-sur-Mer, France, on 25 December 1918. From there Howick Hall went to Bassens for fuel, and on 3 February 1919 departed for the United States. However, a case of spinal meningitis in her crew necessitated her stopping at Bermuda on 21 February 1919. Ship and crew were placed in quarantine and denied communication with the island of Bermuda until she departed for Newport News on 25 February 1919. After calling at Newport News, Howick Hall arrived at Baltimore on 5 March 1919 and decommissioned there on 13 March 1919. She was returned to her former owners the same day. Commercial service, 1919-1942 Once again SS Howick Hall, she returned to commercial service. She was renamed SS Doverden in 1929, then sold in 1930 to the Exeter Shipping Company of London, England. In 1931 she was sold to the McAllum Steamship Company of London, then in 1932 to Lambert Brothers of London, then again in 1935 to H. Constant of London. Doverden was sold for scrap in 1935, but was saved from scrapping when Ditta Luigi Pittaluga Vapori of Genoa, Italy, purchased her and placed her in service as the Italian commercial cargo ship SS Ircania. In 1937 she was sold to the S.A. Cooperativa di Nav Garibaldi of Genoa, and served as an Italian supply ship in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War of 1935-1936. The U.S. Maritime Commission acquired Ircania on 24 June 1941 at Jacksonville, Florida, and renamed her SS Raceland. The Maritime Commission transferred Raceland to the South Atlantic Line on 31 December 1941. In South Atlantic Line service early in World War II, Raceland joined Convoy PQ 13, which departed Boston, Massachusetts, for Reykjav√≠k, Iceland, and then continued to Murmansk in the northern Soviet Union.

He served for 28 years as a member of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Early life Meyer was born near Mequon, Wisconsin, the son of Henry and Louise (Wiepking) Meyer. He attended Oshkosh State Normal School, receiving his bachelor's degree, and then took two degrees, including his doctorate in 1897, from the University of Wisconsin, after doing graduate work at the University of Berlin in 1894‚Äì95. He taught school from 1884 to 1886. He was principal of the Fredonia, Wisconsin, schools from 1887 to 1889. He was principal of the high school at Port Washington, Wisconsin, from 1889 to 1892. After receiving his degrees, he stayed on in Madison to be a sociology instructor. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1899, and to full professor of political economy in 1900. While there, he taught what is believed to be the first course in insurance in the United States. He married Alice Elizabeth Carlton of Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, on August 29, 1901. Government official In 1905, he took leave from his professorship to become a member of the Wisconsin Railroad Commission, and then, in 1907, became its chairman. In 1910, President William Howard Taft appointed him to the U.S. Railroad Security Commission. In 1910, Taft appointed him to the Interstate Commerce Commission. Confirmed by the Senate on December 21, 1910, he took the oath of office on December 31, 1910. Meyer was thereafter appointed to successive terms by Presidents Wilson, Coolidge, Hoover, and Franklin Roosevelt. Following his 1939 retirement, he served as a consultant and mediator for the transportation industry. Meyer also gave attention to improving the ICC's internal capabilities. Meyer and his ally, fellow Commissioner Franklin K. Lane, supported increasing the Commission's ability to compute marginal rates, and the Commission engaged noted economist Max O. Lorenz (inventor of the Lorenz curve) for this task. In 1937, Meyer was attacked by Senator Harry S. Truman for allegedly giving a railroad attorney information about a 1932 Commission decision before it was publicly released. Meyer explained that while he had no recollection of the specific case, it was routine in uncontested cases such as this to give information to the applicant without waiting for a formal decision. While Meyer's fourth and final term expired in 1938, he continued to serve until the following year pending Senate confirmation of a replacement. President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Representative Thomas R. Amlie. The Amlie nomination proved contentious and was withdrawn, and Meyer, wishing to retire, resigned on May 1, 1939. Meyers wrote several books about the transportation industry, including Railroad Legislation in the United States (1903) and History of Transportation in the United States before 1860 (1917). He was a member of the American Economic Association, the American Academy of Political and Social Science, the Wisconsin Academy of Letters Arts and Sciences, the Wisconsin Educational Round Table, the Wisconsin Teachers' Association, the Press Club of the University of Wisconsin, and the Wisconsin Historical Society.

Born in Montana, he earned his Ph.D. in Mathematics at Berkeley in 1966 under Robert Vaught before taking a position at the same institution the following year. He held an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship from 1970 to 1972. Silver made several contributions to set theory in the areas of large cardinals and the constructible universe L.  Contributions  In his 1975 paper \\"On the Singular Cardinals Problem\\", Silver proved that if a cardinal Œ∫ is singular with uncountable cofinality and 2Œª = Œª+ for all infinite cardinals Œª < Œ∫, then 2Œ∫ = Œ∫+. Prior to Silver's proof, many mathematicians believed that a forcing argument would yield that the negation of the theorem is consistent with ZFC. He introduced the notion of a master condition, which became an important tool in forcing proofs involving large cardinals.Cummings, James (2009). \\"Iterated Forcing and Elementary Embeddings\\". In Handbook of Set Theory, Springer, pp. 775‚Äì883, esp. pp. 814ff. Silver proved the consistency of Chang's conjecture using the Silver collapse (which is a variation of the Levy collapse). He proved that, assuming the consistency of a supercompact cardinal, it is possible to construct a model where 2Œ∫=Œ∫++ holds for some measurable cardinal Œ∫. With the introduction of the so-called Silver machines he was able to give a fine structure free proof of Jensen's covering lemma. He is also credited with discovering Silver indiscernibles and generalizing the notion of a Kurepa tree (called Silver's Principle). He discovered 0# (\\"zero sharp\\") in his 1966 Ph.D. thesis, discussed in the graduate textbook Set Theory: An Introduction to Large Cardinals by Frank R. Drake.Drake, F. R. (1974). \\"Set Theory: An Introduction to Large Cardinals\\". Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics 76, Elsevier. Silver's original work involving large cardinals was perhaps motivated by the goal of showing the inconsistency of an uncountable measurable cardinal; instead he was led to discover indiscernibles in L assuming a measurable cardinal exists.

The film won 3 awards in National Film Awards ‚Äì 1993. Pallavi Joshi won National Film Award ‚Äì Special Jury Award, whereas Paresh Rawal won the National Film Award for Best Supporting Actor and Neena Gupta that of the National Film Award for Best Supporting Actress for this movie. Plot Geeta Devi (Neena Gupta) is one of the daughters-in-law of a prominent and wealthy family, who is unfortunately widowed. Still youthful and attractive, she gives in to the wiles of one of the men in the neighbourhood, Lalit Ramji (Paresh Rawal), and starts living with him. She has a daughter, Apsara (Pallavi Joshi) by him, and the three are portrayed as a happy family. One day, Lalit disappears without explanation, and from then on, the lives of the abandoned mother and daughter go steadily downward. Apsara is forced to leave school through her erstwhile in-laws' machinations; with no income, their landlord is forced to let them go, and they have to move to a hutment colony, Geeta begins work as a maidservant in order to earn a living and support her daughter. One of the poignant themes in the movie is Apsara's relationship with her father, to whose illusory love she hangs on with a childlike and, in the end, horribly unjustified faith. Learning that Lalit is now a successful politician, Apsara persuades her mother to travel to New Delhi to meet him as she is sure her father will rescue them from their terrible condition. Rejected, the mother returns, and having lost all hope and faith in human goodness, takes to alcohol. Soon after, she dies leaving her daughter aged 16 all alone. The daughter takes up her mother's job as maidservant in the house of a widower (Om Puri) of 15 years. He seems genuinely concerned for the welfare of the girl and slowly gains her trust and finally asks her to come live with him despite the age gap. After some initial reluctance, the girl finally accepts and starts living with Om Puri, and briefly the young girl is restored to a secure life free of want. Her protector then dies of a heart attack. His relatives accuse the girl of murder and she is taken into custody and questioned by the police. After a few months, she is released for lack of evidence. Left to her own devices, she works for a time as a prostitute. In Mumbai, she lives in the railway station with three other street children, even acquiring a status of leadership among them. One day, she learns that her father is coming to the city from Delhi and will be giving a conference. She decides to attend and during the conference, she gets up and starts shouting to her father that she is his daughter. Lalit ignores her calls and she is escorted out by the police and left a few miles down the road. She then realizes that her mother was right and that her father had really abandoned them to their fate. Faced with the cruelty that life can show, she is walking along, loudly lamenting her fate and reviling life, when one of her father's henchmen slips up behind her, and brutally kills. The movie ends with her dying on the grass.

He served in the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) during the First World War and is credited as being the first RFC pilot to shoot down an enemy aircraft. As a racing driver at Brooklands in the 1930s, his crash was followed by the banning of mechanics racing alongside their drivers. During the Second World War he served as head of MI6's Dutch section. Early life and education Rabagliati, who preferred to use his second name Euan, was born in Manningham, Bradford, Yorkshire, the fourth son of Andrea Rabagliati and Helen Priscilla McLaren. His father, the son of an Italian political refugee who had settled in Edinburgh, worked as a surgeon at Bradford Infirmary. Euan was educated at the Loretto School in Edinburgh and Bradford Grammar School. He then attended the Royal Military College at Sandhurst as a gentlemen cadet, and after passing out was commissioned as a second lieutenant in The King's Own (Yorkshire Light Infantry) on 14 February 1912. Rabagliati became interested in flying, and was awarded Royal Aero Club Aviators' Certificate No. 779 after soloing a Bristol biplane at the Bristol Flying School at Brooklands on 11 May 1914. He was then transferred to the Royal Flying Corps, being appointed a flying officer on 30 June, and was promoted to lieutenant on 12 August. First World War Rabagliati was posted to No. 5 Squadron RFC, which moved to France on 14 August, ten days after Britain's declaration of war on Germany. While selected pilots flew the squadron's twelve aircraft across the channel, Rabagliati and the rest of the squadron's personnel travelled by ship. On 21 August Second Lieutenant C. W. Wilson, with Rabagliati as his observer, flew the squadron's first reconnaissance mission, locating German cavalry ten miles from Namur. On 25 August the squadron was based at La Cateau when a Taube reconnaissance aircraft was seen approaching from the south. The squadron's commanding officer Major John Higgins ordered Wilson to drive him off, and Rabagliati jumped into the observer's seat of their Avro 504 carrying a Lee‚ÄìEnfield .303 rifle and ammunition. Rabagliati steered Wilson to a position ahead and below the Taube, then opened fire with his rifle. Rabagliati fired around 100 rounds before the Taube pilot slumped forward into his seat and the aircraft descended to the ground and landed. Wilson considered landing to capture the aircraft, but observed what he assumed was a German column of troops approaching. Only after landing did he learn that they were British. Wilson and Rabagliati were credited with the first German aircraft shot down by the RFC, and on 8 October Rabagliati received a mention in despatches from Field Marshal John French, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in France. Rabagliati received his second mention in despatches on 5 April 1915, for \\"gallant and distinguished service in the field\\", and was appointed a flight commander with the acting rank of captain on 19 April. He was promoted to captain in the KOYLI on 1 October 1915. On 4 November 1915 he was awarded the Military Cross, his citation reading: :Lieutenant (temporary Captain) Cuthbert Euan Charles Rabagliati, The King's Own (Yorkshire Light Infantry) and Royal Flying Corps. ::For conspicuous gallantry and skill on 28th September, 1915, when, accompanied by Second Lieutenant Vaucour, they carried out a reconnaissance over Valenciennes and Douai. They had to fly in thick cloud for nearly the whole distance, and several times their aeroplane got into a \\"spin\\". The pilot, however, succeeded each time in righting his machine, and they reached their objective and carried out the reconnaissance at 2,800 feet under very heavy fire. The presentation took place at Buckingham Palace on 9 December. On 1 May 1916 Rabagliati was appointed a squadron commander with the acting rank of major, and served as commander of No. 24 Squadron from 29 November 1916 until 22 March 1917. On 1 January 1917 he was brevetted as a major \\"for valuable services rendered in connection with the War\\". On 11 April 1917 he was appointed a wing commander with the acting rank of lieutenant- colonel. Rabagliati received his third mention \\"for distinguished service in war areas\\" in January 1919. In June he was awarded the Air Force Cross, and in August the L√©gion d'honneur from France. He resigned his commission on 6 August 1919, but was permitted to retain his rank. Inter-war career Insurance broker After the war Rabagliati became a member of Lloyd's of London, and in August 1920, as a representative of the White Cross Aviation Insurance Association, was appointed to Lloyd's Aviation Sub-Committee. In August 1929 he was a member of the British Aviation Insurance Group, authorized to issue Certificates of Airworthiness. In January 1930 he was appointed to Lloyd's Aviation Advisory Committee, as an underwriting member of Lloyd's, and of Messrs. Willis, Faber and Dumas. On 1 July 1932, the Aviation Committees of Lloyd's Register of Shipping and the British Corporation Register of Shipping & Aircraft were merged into a joint committee of which Rabagliati was a member. Racing driver Rabagliati also had a parallel career as an amateur racing driver. He is said to have competed for the √âireann Cup in the 1st Irish Grand Prix, held at Phoenix Park on 13 July 1929. He drove a 2-litre Lagonda OH for Fox & Nicholl (although the programme and reports for the event appears not to confirm this). The next year, on 9 May 1930, Rabagliati took part in the Double Twelve Hour Race at Brooklands, driving a Talbot AO90. Towards the end of the first day's racing, while attempting to overtake the Austin 7 Ulster of Archibald Frazer-Nash, Rabagliati lost control and skidded, and his fellow Talbot driver Roland Hebeler crashed into him. Rabagliati's car span off the track into the spectator area, killing one and injuring twenty others, many seriously. Edward \\"Ted\\" Allery, Rabagliati's riding mechanic, was killed, and Rabagliati suffered severe head injuries, having a silver plate inserted into his skull. After waking from a coma, his first words was to ask for a bottle of champagne. The accident gave rise to the legal case: Hall v. Brooklands Auto Racing Club, after which the signs \\"Motor Racing is Dangerous\\" were displayed at all race meetings. Reserve officer Rabagliati was a member of the Reserve of Air Force Officers, being confirmed in his rank of flying officer on 29 March 1924. On 15 September 1925 he was transferred from Class \\"A\\" to Class \\"C\\" with the rank of squadron leader, finally relinquishing his commission on completion of his period of service in November 1926. Rabagliati also remained a member of the Army Reserve of Officers until 4 June 1948, finally relinquishing his commission on exceeding the age limit of liability to recall, but retained the rank of lieutenant colonel. Second World War During the Second World War Rabagliati served as an officer of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6). In June 1941 Rabagliati met with Thomas Sneum, a former Danish Naval Air Service lieutenant who had flown from Denmark to England in a Hornet Moth (which necessitated him climbing out onto the wings mid-flight to refuel). During the meeting, at Rabagliati's home in St. James's, close to the offices of MI6, he persuaded Sneum to return to Denmark as an agent. Rabagliati, working with Dutch former police chief Fran√ßois van 't Sant, head of the Dutch Central Intelligence Department in London, infiltrated five agents into the Netherlands, to provide communications with Dutch resistance groups, but by December 1941 only one, Aart Alblas, was still at liberty. Alblas was finally arrested, and executed at Mauthausen in September 1944. Rabagliati's first operation as head of Section P8, covering the Netherlands, was in March 1942 when he attempted to infiltrate two agents by boat. The men were transported across the North Sea by MGB 325 from the 15th Motor Gunboat Flotilla at Great Yarmouth. Unfortunately while being rowed ashore by Charles Elwell, the first lieutenant, their boat capsized and all three were captured. One of the agents, Maessen, a Dutch naval officer, was executed, and Elwell ended the war in Colditz. Rabagliati was also responsible for \\"Operation Contact Holland\\". During this operation Dutch agents were put ashore in Scheveningen. One of them, Peter Tazelaar, went ashore wearing a tuxedo under his wet suit. Tazelaar's insertion into Holland was the inspiration for the pre-title sequence of the James Bond film Goldfinger. The film's screenwriter, Paul Dehn, had served in SOE, and was aware of Tazelaar's insertion. The operation's leader, Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema, wrote Soldier of Orange describing his war time experiences. In the film based on the book, Edward Fox played the character \\"Colonel Rafelli\\", which was based on Rabagliati. Post-war After the war Rabagliati was the British vice-consul in San Francisco, and in 1954 he was appointed President of the British American Trade Centre, based in San Francisco, which aimed to promote and assist trade between the UK and the USA. Rabagliati eventually retired to Cannes in the South of France. He died in 1978. Personal life Rabagliati was married three times; firstly in 1916 to Monica Priestley, the daughter of Joseph Child Priestley, then on 4 December 1922 to Clarissa Catherine Melvill de Hochepied Larpent, daughter of John Melvill, 9th Baron de Hochepied, at St Ethelburga's Bishopsgate, London. His third marriage was on 7 March 1940 to Beatrix Purdey Oliver, the widow of Vincent Gandolfi-Hornyold, 3rd Duke Gandolfi.

Early life Georg Hansen was born in Sonnefeld, the son of Theodor Hansen, a Oberforstmeister (Senior Ranger) for the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. In Coburg, he attended since 1914 the Gymnasium (high school) Casimirianum, where he graduated in 1923. He then studied law for two semesters at the University of Erlangen. In 1924 he joined the Panzergruppe of the Reichswehr (later the Wehrmacht). He was promoted to Leutnant in 1927, and then Oberleutnant in 1931 at the Bavarian Motor Vehicles Department in F√ºrth. In the same year he married Irene St√∂lzel from Michelau; with her he had five children. In 1935 Hansen became the commander of the general staff training at the Military Academy (Kriegsakademie) in Berlin-Moabit, where he met the Chief of General Staff Ludwig Beck and Graf Claus von Stauffenberg. In 1937, he was transferred from the training academy to the Department of Foreign Intelligence and Counterintelligence (Department of Foreign Armies of the East) in the War Ministry of the Reich under the command of Konteradmiral Wilhelm Canaris. Beginning in 1939, this department was renamed as Amt Ausland / Abwehr (Office of the Foreign Military Intelligence). There Hansen, as a group leader in Division I, was promoted to Major in May 1941 and Oberstleutnant in July 1942. In 1943 he succeeded Hans Piekenbrock as the Chief of the Division I, Secret Intelligence Service. His tasks included military reconnaissance in the foreign countries. Finally, Canaris, before his resignation in February 1944, appointed Georg Hansen to succeed him as Head of Military Intelligence. In March 1944 Hansen attended a meeting with the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) to set up a unified intelligence service. Two months later, in May 1944, he and most of his staff were transferred to the Reichssicherheitshauptamt (RSHA), where he served as the deputy under his immediate superior, Walther Schellenberg. Assassination attempt on Hitler Probably under the influence of Beck, Hansen's conversion took himself to the opposition by 1938; the official review of the crimes of the Nazi Regime might have led him to finally join the Resistance. He was one of the key informants of the resistance group led by two men, Generalmajor Henning von Tresckow and Oberst Claus Count von Stauffenberg. Hansen worked since 1943 in all plans for the Hitler assassination attempt. In 1944, he took part in the most important meetings about the preparations. Hansen organised the use of cars and airplanes as well as the protection of the co-conspirators. His house in Rangsdorf often served as the meeting place for the conspirators. If the attack succeeded, he would occupy the RSHA and have the SS commanders arrested. In addition, it was planned to have him, on the behalf of Beck, who was assigned as interim Head of State, to negotiate with General Dwight D. Eisenhower for a separate accord of peace with the Western Powers. Because of strong disagreements with Stauffenberg about the political plans after the attack, Hansen decided on short notice against personal participation and drove on 18 July to Michelau for the baptism of his youngest daughter. Although he knew that Hitler had survived the attack and that the coup attempt had failed, and despite the possibility of escape, he returned on 21 July. On 22 July the Gestapo chief, Heinrich M√ºller, summoned him to the RSHA, where Hansen was arrested in the waiting room. He was put through a prolonged interrogation, during which he broke down and confessed to everything. On 4 August he was given by the Ehrenhof (Court of Honour), formed two days earlier, a dishonourable discharge from the Wehrmacht, so that the court-martial (Reichskriegsgericht) was no longer responsible for the sentencing. Death On the day of the arraignment, 10 August 1944, Georg Hansen, as well as Erich Fellgiebel, Alfred Kranzfelder, Fritz-Dietlof Graf von der Schulenburg and Berthold Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg were, in a show trial Der 20. Juli 1944, Gedenkst√§tte Deutscher Widerstand [ Memorial Center of the German Resistance ], Pl√∂tzensee, 2003 at the Volksgerichtshof under President Roland Freisler, sentenced to death. On 8 September 1944, the judgment was execution by hanging at Pl√∂tzensee Prison. Aftermath The Hansen family was deemed to be guilty by association. Its properties were confiscated, the wife was arrested and the five children were placed in a children's home in Bad Sachsa, where they were not permitted to carry the family name. In the same home were also the children of other conspirators, such as the Stauffenbergs and von Witzlebens. In late September 1944, the children were allowed to return to their mother, who was also released, in Michelau. The hostility towards the family continued even after the end of the war. Hansen's widow waged a year-long fight against the Federal Republic of Germany in the courts to obtain a pension as a war widow. But the courts denied her because her husband had been dishonourably discharged from the Wehrmacht.

It is a single-engine mid-wing monoplane. Restored shortly after the Second World War, it remains part of the Shuttleworth CollectionThe Shuttleworth Collection - Blackburn Type D Retrieved 31 Aug 2017 and is the oldest British flying aeroplane. Development The Type D,This type designation is used by the Shuttleworth Collection, though when writing his history of Blackburn aircraft in 1968, A.J. Jackson noted that the type letter was not known a wooden, fabric-covered single-seat monoplane powered by a Gnome rotary engine, was built for Cyril Foggin in 1912. The design inherited some features from the earlier Mercury: it too had thin wings of constant chord with square tips of about the same span as the later Mercuries and used wing warping rather than ailerons. The wing was wire braced from above via a kingpost and below via the undercarriage, and was built up around machined I-section ash spars. The Type D also had the triangular cross-section fuselage seen on several of Blackburn's aircraft from the Second Monoplane onward. It was a more pleasing- looking machine with a shorter fuselage, cowled engine, simplified undercarriage and heavily revised empennage. The fuselage had rounded upper decking and aluminium covering at the front. Blackburn had persisted with the Second Monoplane's Antoinette-style fin and tailplane through subsequent aircraft, but the Type D's tailplane had a much less steeply swept leading edge (though still 60¬∞) than its predecessors and carried a divided elevator. The fin likewise was less swept though still long, and now carried a single rudder rather than the characteristic triangular pair previously used. The undercarriage featured a pair of wheels, compared with four on the Mercury, with two struts per side terminating on skids and joined by the axle and a higher transverse strut. For the first time, Blackburn fitted a rudder bar in preference to his \\"triple steering column\\". The aircraft first flew late in 1912. Some modifications followed in time: the engine cowling was extended into a semicircular shape to discourage the discharge of smoke and hot oil from the rotary into the cockpit; the wingtips were slightly rounded, and the crook-shaped skids were replaced by skids of hockey stick form. In 1913 the basic Type D design was developed into the two-seat Blackburn Type I. Operational history The Blackburn Type D monoplane was built in 1912 for Cyril Foggin.http://www.earlyaviators.com/efoggin.htm Harold Blackburn first flew the plane in December 1912, and used the Type D for a series of demonstration flights from Lofthouse Park, situated between Leeds and Wakefield, from March to May 1913.Flight 12 April 1913 Foggin received his \\"wings\\", RAeC #349 in November 1912 on a Bleriot monoplane,Flight 2 November 1912 and first flew his new Blackburn monoplane in March 1913http://www.earlyaviators.com/eglew.htm holding demonstrations with Blackburn.\\"The Blackburn at Leeds\\", Flight 29 March 1913, p 359.Flight 5 April 1913; archived online at http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1913/1913%20-%200386.html Blackburn also flew to neighbouring towns: to Stamford, dropping leaflets; to Harrogate, where he landed; and on three successive days in late July to York, carrying bundles of the Leeds-printed Yorkshire Post. Later in 1913 Foggin sold the aircraft to Montague Francis Glew. Glew qualified RAeC #410 at the Blackburn school on a \\"Blackburn monoplane\\",Flight 8 February 1913; archived online at http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1913/1913%20-%200142.html apparently an earlier model.

The remains lay untouched on the family farm at Wittering, until discovered by and sold to Richard Ormonde Shuttleworth in 1938. After World War II, the machine was restored by Shuttleworth's engineers. Almost all of the restored aircraft was original apart from the main wing spars, engine cowling, some minor wooden pieces and the fabric. The original Gnome was also discovered, though the restored aircraft used a slightly newer (1916) Gnome.

Nicholls won four caps for Wales, and was part of the Welsh team that beat the first touring Southern Hemisphere team the New Zealand Natives. He was the elder brother of Wales rugby legend Gwyn Nicholls, and his son Jack Nicholls was a Welsh international footballer. Life history Nicholls was born in 1868 in Hartpury, England to Hartley Nicholls, a farm supervisor, and his wife Jane Eliza (n√©e, Millard).Parry-Jones (1999), pg 14. The second eldest of five children, he had an elder sister and five younger brothers, the third of his brothers being Gwyn Nicholls. In the mid-1870s the family left England and crossed over to Wales, where the family settled in Roath.Parry-Jones (1999), pg 16. After the end of his rugby career, Nicholls became a publican and in 1894 he acquired a business interest in the Grand Hotel, opposite the Cardiff Arms Park.Parry-Jones (1999), pg 32. Nicholls would run the Grand up until 1901, when he decided to become a professional rugby league footballer. Now a veteran player, Nicholls was still able to demand a five figure sum for his switch to the league code. He left Wales for Hull that year, returning in 1910.Parry-Jones (1999), pg 87. He was instrumental in the growth of Cardiff City F.C., and \\"Cardiff City was admitted to the Second Division of the Southern League in 1910. A board of directors was elected with S. H. Nicholls as the first chairman.\\"http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/news/article/1899-1920-724134.aspx He went on to become Chairman of Council of South Wales Football Association between 1920‚Äì1921http://www.southwalesfa.co.uk/swfa_organisation_pastofficersoftheassociation.html and was a Director of Cardiff City when they reached the F.A. Cup final in 1927. He was influential in critical team decisions in the run up to the cup final and almost removed the Cardiff Captain, Fred Keenor, in the run up to the match. \\"Keenor was officially listed at a meeting of club directors at The Corporation pub in Canton on 19 January 1927. At the summit, called by Sid Nicholls, fellow board member Walter Riden ‚Äì Keenor's old teacher at Stacey Road Primary School in Adamsdown ‚Äì proposed listing the captain. Nicholls seconded the idea and Keenor's future at Ninian was in jeopardy. But within weeks the captain won his place back, his name was removed from the list and on 23 April he led the Bluebirds to their most famous victory, a 1‚Äì0 win over Arsenal.\\".http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/keenor-out- favour-1927-cup-2118254 Nicholls is seen in film newsreels of the match introducing King George V to the Cardiff City players and sat with the King to watch the match. By June 1928 Nicholls was the Vice-President F. A. Wales.Photograph of Meeting of The International Football Association Board, 9 June 1928 Around 1920, Nicholls had met Katherine Brennan and went on to have a second family with her consisting of five sons and one daughter out of wedlock, scandalous for the time. He lost his money in the stockmarket crash of 1929, bringing up the family in poverty in Splott, Cardiff in the 1930s. He married Katherine Brennan in 1934.p475. Marriages registered in July August September 1934 Rugby career Nicholls joined Cardiff while still in his teens and was part of the Second XV during the team's unbeaten 1885‚Äì86 season.Parry-Jones (1999), pg 26. The following season he was part of the first team and in 1888 he scored 11 tries for the club, a large number for a forward. He later became vice-captain of the first team to Charlie Arthur's captaincy. Nicholls was first selected to represent Wales in 1888, in the first match between the country and Southern Hemisphere opposition, the New Zealand Natives. The game was played at St. Helen's, Swansea, in front of a hostile home crowd, unhappy at the lack of Swansea players in the back positions. Nicholls was one of eight new caps in the Welsh team, which included Cardiff teammate Norman Biggs.Billot (1972), pg 17. Nicholls was instrumental in setting up the second try for Jim Hannan, in a 5‚Äì0 Welsh win. A week later Nicholls was part of the Cardiff team that faced the same New Zealand side. Cardiff were victorious, with Nicholls scoring a try which was jointly given to Nicholls and W.T. Morgan.Billot (1972), pg 21. Nicholls was reselected for Wales in the very next international, a match against Scotland as part of the 1889 Home Nations Championship. Under the captaincy of Frank Hill, Wales were beaten by two tries to nil, though selectors kept faith with Nicholls when he was chosen for the final game of the tournament to Ireland. After another loss, Nicholls found himself out of favour and was replaced by William Williams. Nicholls played just one more game for Wales in the 1891 Championship as part of Willie Thomas' team that took on Scotland. The Scottish outplayed Wales scoring seven tries without reply, with the Welsh team hamstrung by an inefficient pair of halves.Griffiths (1987), pg 4:5. Nicholls retired from playing rugby union in 1891, but in 1901, he was lured North to take up professional rugby league. The decision was a shock to his family, but the money for turning professional was good. He joined Hull Rugby League in the 1901/02 season and remained with the club until 1910, when Nicholls was 41.

At the age of eight, he was sent to the Blue Quills Indian residential school near St. Paul, Alberta, where the principal recognized his innate artistic talent and encouraged him in his art.\\"Artist Alex Janvier's work on display at National Gallery\\". Calgary Herald, Peter Robb: November 26, 2016 Alex Janvier received formal art training from the Provincial Institute of Technology and Art in Calgary (now the Alberta College of Art and Design) and graduated with honours in 1960. He was one of the first Canadian First Nations artists to train in a professional art school. Immediately after graduation, Janvier took up an opportunity to instruct art at the University of Alberta. In 1966, the federal Department of Indian and Northern Affairs commissioned him to produce 80 paintings.

His abstract style is particularly suited to large-scale works. He makes magic arts and three-dimensional works. Two of his stylistic influences among Western artists are Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky, while among Native traditions he is particularly inspired by the abstract patterns of traditional hide-painting, beadwork and quillwork.  Politics  Alex Janvier signed his paintings with his treaty number from 1966 to 1977 to protest government policies against Aboriginal people.National Aboriginal Achievement Foundation He also makes references to treaty language in the \\"ironic and allusive\\" titles of his art, such as \\"Sun Shines, Grass Grows, Rivers Flow\\", grounding his abstract art in political conflicts.  Morning Star  In 1993 a large abstract painting by Janvier, Morning Star, was installed at the river end of the Grand Hall of the Canadian Museum of History, where a seven-storey-high dome rises above the granite floor. Janvier created the painting with the assistance of his son Dean, between June and September. Janvier titled the work Morning Star in reference to the star's use as a direction-finder. He planned the four areas of colour in the outside ring to represent periods in Native history: yellow, for early history in harmony with nature; blue, for the changes brought about by contact with European civilization; red, for revival and optimism; and white for reconciliation and a return to harmony.\\"Morning Star\\".

An area of marble flagstone extending around the village circa from north to south, and from east to west displays around 500 engraved figures in total. The marble is of a calcareous type called cipolin; it has an ideal composition for engraving, having low resistance to friction and breaking easily. Figures were engraved into the marble using a hammer and an engraving tool. The figures are mostly geometrical, consisting of groups of circles, some isolated and some in groups. It has been speculated that the engraving represent concepts or stories from myths, or elaborate a cosmogeny. History The age of the engravings has proven difficult to determine. Radiometric dating has produced a range of estimates, dating various carvings to between 300 and 3000 years of age. The petroglyph site was discovered in 1933 by a French researcher named Buisson.http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/central- africa/cameroon.php-The Bradshaw Foundation World Heritage Status In the twentieth and twenty first centuries, the calcareous marble on which the engravings stand has been extracted for use at nearby cement and marble factories.

Between 1683 and 1696 the house was completely rebuilt by Sir George Mackenzie on a quadrangular plan. In 1739 John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll, purchased the house and renamed it Caroline Park after his daughter. He commissioned William Adam to design an extension, which was built in 1740‚Äì1741. By 1793 it had been inherited by Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch. In the 19th century it was leased to tenants including Henry Cockburn and Alicia Scott, composer of the tune Annie Laurie.

(His name has also been spelled \\"Louis Buckner\\". With ) Born and raised a slave as a child, Buckner was freed in 1865 and later apprenticed to a furniture maker. He became one of several successful African-American construction entrepreneurs in late-19th century Sevier County, Tennessee. At least fifteen homes that were either built by Buckner or are believed to have been built by Buckner are still standing, two of which are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.Robbie Jones, Lewis Buckner .

His mother was an African-American slave and his father is believed to have been white. He and his mother were freed in 1865 after the American Civil War. In the 1870s, Buckner learned the trade of furniture-making as an apprentice to a white Sevierville furniture-maker named Christian Stump. Buckner married Jane Bryant in 1875. By 1880 he had established his own cabinet-making business.Robbie Jones, The Historic Architecture of Sevier County, Tennessee (Sevierville, Tenn.: Smoky Mountain Historical Society, 1997), pp. 50-51, 260, 265-269, 277. In 2015, the Tennessee State Museum announced it has acquired an elaborate bed and dresser made by Buckner about 1889. With his skills, Buckner could handle larger carpentry and construction projects. He built his first house-- the Darius and Mary Robertson House-- around 1880. Buckner's subsequent houses included the Wayland-Patterson House (1886) near the Fair Garden community, the Riley H. Andes House (ca. 1890) in Sevierville, the Trotter-Waters House (1895) in downtown Sevierville, the Sam Dixon House (1914) near the Shady Grove Community, and the Mullendore House (1921) near Pigeon Forge. He built his own house in the Mullican Grove community in 1894. In 1886, Buckner teamed up with African-American bricklayer Isaac Dockery (1832-1910) to help build the New Salem Baptist Church in Sevierville. Dockery built up the brick walls and Buckner created the interior design. Buckner's techniques Like other carpenters and builders, Buckner drew from circulated pattern books for his work, but he modified such basic patterns to create his own unique renditions. Buckner's houses were typically 2-story Italianate or Queen Anne \\"I-frame\\" designs. Buckner often carved and built much of the houses' exterior detailing-- which included bargeboards, porches, and scrollwork-- as well as the houses' interior elements, including mantels, cabinets, and newell posts. Structures built by Buckner Lewis Buckner. At least fifteen houses currently standing in Sevier County are believed to have been built by Buckner. Some have not been verified by any source other than oral tradition or the fact that certain designs strongly resemble Buckner's known works. Two that could be documented as his have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Houses built or renovated by Buckner include: *Riley H. Andes House, on Douglas Dam Road in Sevierville, Tennessee, built around 1890; added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. *Sam Dixon House, built in 1914 near the Shady Grove community. *William Cal Jones House, built circa 1886 in the Fair Garden community, usually attributed to Buckner. *Lafollette- Patterson House, a two-story house in the Fair Garden community east of Sevierville. *Mullendore House, built in 1921 near Pigeon Forge. *Darius and Mary Robertson House, a 2-story I-frame house built circa 1880 in the Harrisburg community outside of Sevierville. Buckner did most of the house's original interior design work. *Trotter-Waters House, at 217 Cedar Street in downtown Sevierville, built in the Queen Anne style in c.1895; added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.

Gameplay Players must change the colors of blocks by controlling a character who walks on and climbs up on them. As blocks fall from the sky, the player must also avoid these, and avoid stepping on blocks when they are shaking. Cubes can be climbed on to the next level and even pushed over in order to get all the cubes touched on the same level to score more points. Special pick-up object blocks give the character a mega punch to knock blocks off of the level in the direction of the punch. If they don't retrieve the object, the section of blocks disappear. If the character stands on a multi-color flash block, their energy level is restored by as much as half of the energy meter displayed on the left of the game screen. To get better viewing angles, the player can rotate the cube tower 90 degrees in either direction, or looking at the tower from above, to let the player see where the character is going and if any cubes will be falling in that section, or if there are no cubes in one section. The game is cleared when the character climbs up ten floors and the score only counts when the ten floors are cleared. The endless mode is where the character stands on a 3X3 block level and blocks continue to fall down. If the character stands on all of the blocks on the same floor in endless mode, their energy level is fully restored. More blocks continue to fall up to as many as eight, until the character climbs up every ten floors before the falling blocks ease off for a while. The game is over if the character is either squashed from a falling block with no energy left, or if they stand on a section of blocks that are about to disappear and the character falls off.

Gameplay The game is set in a factory, where the player is a worker who must cut six squares out of a sheet of paper in various patterns to form cubes (or boxes) which, once folded properly, are lifted away from the playing field. The stylus is used to choose between three options to perform this task: Scissors, to cut the paper; Fold, which enables the player to assemble a cut pattern into a box; and Reattach, to erase cuts made in error. There are two modes of play: R&D; Mode and Factory Mode. In both, the objective of the game is the same‚Äîto form boxes until the timer runs out‚Äîand the player is penalized for any stray squares left over on the playing field afterward. R&D; Mode In this mode, different patterns to form cubes are introduced to the player. The player is given sheets of paper squares to work with, and must come up with the correct patterns to cut out of their paper sheets in order to clear the floor entirely before the timer runs out. R&D; Mode allows the player character to rise in rank and earn promotions and new outfits or uniforms to wear. Factory Mode In this mode, the player is given a time limit and an endless sheet of paper to cut into boxes that may be scrolled down from the top of the screen as it is used up. Periodically, bombs will fall onto the playing field, and the player may form a box around the bomb to earn a bonus, but if the bomb is allowed to explode, it will burn away adjacent squares of paper. The player is penalized for stray squares left behind and/or any paper that falls off of the screen as it is scrolled downward. Factory Mode allows the player character to earn money, and upon reaching certain amounts the character gains new items for its miniature garden on the top screen.

He is considered a \\"legend\\" of the downtown New York theater scene and is known for his distinctive accent and diction. Early life Edgar Oliver was born in Savannah, Georgia, the son of Edgar Joseph Oliver Jr. and Mary Louise Gibson. His father died (of a morphine overdose) in Dallas, Texas before he was born. He and his older sister Helen (a painter) were raised by their mother Louise, residing on 36th Street. Louise died when he was 27 years old. Both Oliver siblings attended the 37th Street School and the Cathedral School as elementary students. Later, Edgar studied at Benedictine Military School while Helen was at St. Vincent's Academy for girls, both were valedictorians of their classes, '74 and '73 at their respective Catholic schools. He attended George Washington University. At a live The Moth event, recorded on January 25, 2006, Oliver recalled how he and his sister Helen escaped their eccentric mother by running away to Paris using their trust money from their deceased father. Their mother chased them in her car when they tried leaving. They ran away the first summer after they started college at George Washington University. On April 30, 2011, at another The Moth event, he related further adventures of his, when he, Helen, and a friend Jason traveled to Tangier, Morocco, to (eventually) meet author Paul Bowles. Career Oliver first started performing in New York City at the Pyramid Club in the mid-1980s. Notable New York City productions include his roles in Edward II with Cliplight Theater and numerous productions at the Axis Theatre Company including A Glance at New York (which played at the Edinburgh Festival) and his autobiographical one-man show East 10th Street: Self Portrait With Empty House, which enjoyed an extended run with Axis. His film credits include the Independent Spirit Award-winning The Jimmy Show and the multiaward-winning Henry May Long. He appeared in the Jared Hess film Gentlemen Broncos and had the leading role as a Futurist performance artist in the comedy feature That's Beautiful Frank. He is also a frequent storyteller for The Moth radio program. Oliver has written at least a dozen plays, \\"including The Poetry Killers, The Ghost of Brooklyn, When She Had Blood Lust, The Master of Monstrosity, I Am A Coffin, My Green Hades and Chop Off Your Ear\\". These has often been produced at La MaMa ETC, most notably the 2000 production of his play The Drowning Pages starred Deborah Harry (of Blondie fame). Oliver has published two poetry collections: A Portrait of New York by a Wanderer There, Summer, and the novel The Man Who Loved Plants. His style has been characterized as \\"characterized as 19th Century romantic\\". Oliver has also gained cult fame appearing on the Science Channel series Oddities and was notable for his line \\"Is that a straitjacket?\\", which was featured in the show's promos. He hosts the spin-off show Odd Folks Home. On November 26, 2011, Third Man Records released a tricolor 45 RPM single of his \\"In The Park\\". Only 150 copies were produced. Fifty were sold at Third Man Records in Nashville, Tennessee, and fifty at Obscura in New York. Fifty copies were mailed at random out to those who ordered the unlimited black vinyl version. His show East 10th Street: Self Portrait With Empty House won a Fringe First Award in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 2009, competing against 750 shows. Personal life Oliver has resided on the Lower East Side of New York City since 1977. His dwelling was an apartment on the top floor of a building with no other occupants but has since relocated.

Since 2006 it has been part of the Sussex Community NHS Trust, which has overall management responsibility. Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust also provides some services. The hospital is located in the West Green neighbourhood of Crawley, near the town centre. History Crawley grew slowly as a small market town until the Second World War. Until 1896, the only medical treatment available was offered in Horsham, away, under the provisions of the various Poor Laws. A cottage hospital with six beds was established that year; by 1913 it had been extended to a nine-bed facility, and there were 12 beds and an operating theatre in 1922. The hospital was paid for by public donations and fundraising; patients paid as much as they could afford for treatment. These premises became too small, and a new \\"district hospital\\" was established at Ifield Lodge in West Green‚Äîthen a mostly residential area west of Crawley High Street‚Äîin the 1930s. In 1947, Crawley was selected as one of the sites for the Government's proposed New Towns‚Äîplanned communities designed to accommodate people moved out of London, which was overcrowded and war-damaged. The master plan allocated land in the southeast of the development area for a large new hospital, and the 1930s facility was expected to be demolished. Both Crawley Urban District Council (the forerunner of the present Borough Council) and Crawley Development Corporation (the body responsible for planning and developing the New town) supported this proposal, but the regional health authority preferred building a new hospital on the existing site. A public inquiry upheld this demand in 1958, and construction work on a new building started the following year. The first part of the building was completed in 1961 or 1962. Extensions were built between 1966 and 1970 and in 1981. Originally, a full range of services was provided: outpatient care, an Accident and Emergency department and a maternity unit. Funding cuts and the opening of a new hospital in nearby Haywards Heath affected the hospital's status, however, and for a period during the 1990s it was threatened with closure. In 1998 the NHS Trust responsible for the hospital merged with that of East Surrey Hospital in Redhill, Surrey, which was developed as the main facility: services such as Accident and Emergency provision and maternity care were concentrated there over the next few years, and Crawley was downgraded to \\"sub-acute\\" status. By 2004, however, the Trust had provided services for cancer patients and children, and in July that year a new 24-hour \\"Walk-in Centre\\" was opened, offering an inferior level of service to the former Accident and Emergency department. This was changed in 2007 to an Urgent Treatment Centre. In 2008, paediatric surgery was moved to East Surrey Hospital. An ambulance station was built in 1963 on Exchange Road in Crawley town centre. It had moved to West Green by the 1980s, and is now operated by the South East Coast Ambulance Service. Architecture The Yorke Rosenberg Mardall architectural partnership, led by F. R. S. Yorke and noted for its Modernist hospital designs, received the commission for the hospital. Architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner, writing in 1965, praised the building, describing it as \\"easily the best building in Crawley up to date\\". It is a three- to four- storey reinforced concrete structure clad with dark steel, white tiles, red glazed bricks and large areas of glass.

Until May 17, when the Protocol of Corfu was signed, the autonomist Epirote forces managed retain their positions and push back the attacks of Albanian irregulars and gendarmerie, which was under the command of Dutch officers. When World War I broke out, the Greek forces, after approval from the Triple Entente Powers, re-entered Northern Epirus. In the subsequent legislative elections, Dimitrios Doulis was elected as member of the Greek parliament for the Argyrokastron Prefecture.Albania's Captives. Pyrrhus J. Ruches. Argonaut, 1965. p. 97. Doulis retired from the Greek Army with the rank of Colonel on 2 May 1915 (O.S.), and died in Athens in 1928.

It replaced the former Mk F3 155mm in French Army service. The AuF1 primary advancement is that it incorporates and provides full armor and nuclear-biological-chemical (NBC) protection for its crew of four, while the former Mk F3 155mm offered no protection and could carry only two of its four crew members. The AuF1 saw combat with the Iraqi Army in the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. History Though the French Mk F3 155mm would remain in production through the 1980s, by the early 1970s the French Army realized there was an urgent need for its replacement. The Mk. 3 155mm lacked a traversable turret and nuclear-biological-chemical (NBC) protection for its crew, and could carry only two of the four crew members needed to operate it (the remaining two having to be transported in support vehicles). Development of the AuF1 began in the late 1960s under the trade name of 155 GCT (155 mm Grande Cadence de Tir; high rate of fire) and the first production version, known as the AuF1, was introduced during the 1980s. About 400 have been produced, with 70 having been upgraded to the AUF2 variant. AuF1 The CN 155 AuF1 (Canon de 155 Automoteur Mod√®le F1, meaning \\"155 mm self-propelled gun model F1\\") is based on the AMX-30 main battle tank (MBT) chassis and equipped with a 155mm 39-caliber (L/39) gun with a bustle-mounted autoloader, giving a rate of fire of 8 rounds per minute. It is also equipped with a roof- mounted 12.7mm anti-aircraft gun. The AUF1 has an effective range of 23,000 meters firing conventional rounds and 28,000 meters using Rocket Assisted Projectiles (RAPs). The first production AMX-30 AuF1s were delivered exclusively to the Saudi Arabian Army, while the French Army received their first deliveries in 1980, deploying the AMX-30 AuF1 in regiments of 18 guns each. In addition, the Iraqi Army received a number of AMX-30 AuF1 variants in 1980, which they employed during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. Variants and upgrades * AuF1 \\"experimental\\": pre-production model tested by the French field corps in 1979. They can be recognized by the lack of louver on the right front part of the turret. One of the six was also fitted with a bore evacuator. The six were later upgraded to the H standard. * AuF1 H: this designation appeared when the AuF1 T was introduced in order to distinguish the two models. The AuF1 H is fitted with a Citro√´n AZ 5.4 hp auxiliary power unit (APU) mounted under armor. * AuF1 T: also known as CTI (Conduite de Tir Inertielle; inertial fire control system), it is fitted with an inertial navigation system linked to the main gun fire control system. The Citro√´n AZ APU is replaced by a G√©vaudan micro-gas turbine, the latter required a more curved glacis plate. * AuF1 TM: also known as T-MODEX (MODule EXp√©rimental; \\"experimental module\\") 24 were made and were used to test the implementation of the ATLAS system. The AuF1 TM were only used by the 40th artillery regiment. * AuF1 TA: TA stands for Tourelle ATLAS (ATLAS turret), they were built on AMX-30B2 chassis (which featured stronger torsion bar) using the more powerful Renault-Mack E9 diesel engine. As this new engine was taller, a new 12 cm turret ring was fitted in order to raise up the turret. Unlike the previous variants, the AuF1 TM lacks of APU and uses buffer batteries. * AU F2: proposed upgrade from the 1990s. Increased range (40 km) and rate of fire (10 rnds/min) is accomplished by having a longer L/52 gun as well as an improved autoloader using modular artillery propelling charges. Operational history A battery of 8 AuF1s from the French Army's was deployed in support of the Rapid Reaction Force on Mount Igman during the 1995 NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The battery provided rapid counter-battery fire against Serb artillery units during the siege of Sarajevo, the long range of its guns allowing it to dominate the surrounding terrain.

These kinds of composites made are strong, light and high-tech materials. Such composite propellers can be produced in several ways, including vacuum infused molding and injection molding process, depending on size and resin viscocity. With today's technology composites propellers cannot be said to be undeniably better than traditional metal alloys in the marine propeller application. The composite material does still have several perks compared to the metal propellers counterparts.  Advantages  The composite propellers can be made with a layup which causes composites with anisotropic properties. This can be designed to make create passive adaptation of the propeller blades passive self-twisting propeller. Self-twisting blades have been found to be much more energy efficiency compared to rigid propeller blades[2]. Passive adaptation in form might also be affected bu propeller geometry. Lower unit production cost [reference needed] and production without heat are the primary advantages of composite material. While the initial cost of a composite propeller is usually comparable to aluminum, it is significantly less than a stainless steel propeller. Additionally, replacement blades offer significant savings over metal propeller repairs. Another advantage to using composite propellers is that it is a lightweight material. Composite material is about half the weight of aluminum and 1/6 the weight of stainless steel propeller. A lightweight propeller reduces the amount of wear and tear on the entire boat [reference needed].  Effect on the environment  Composite materials are an environmentally friendly option as the corrosive resistance [3] and resistance to impact damage of composites [4] can lead to long lifetime in composite propellers. When a composite propeller hits debris, the propeller absorbs the impact energy, instead of transferring it to the lower unit; therefore, providing more protection for the drive train[reference needed]. Corrosion from salt water, and electrolysis are basically nonexistent with composite material in water[reference needed], still the water saturation of the propellers and the propeller application causes some problem to the longevity of composite propellers.¬∑The corrosive resistant properties of composites cannot be said to be undeniably better than traditional metal alloys in the propeller application with today's technology [5].

She left the series on 7 January 2011.The last appearance of Simone Ritscher as Maria Two months later, on 17 March 2011, the character was killed off off- screen, to the anger of many fans.FRANCESCA Storylines The loyal secretary Maria is the loyal private secretary of the Waldensteyck family and arrives together with Princess Luise (Mascha M√ºller) in D√ºsseldorf. She schedules every meeting for her and tries to groom her for her assignments as representative of her family. Maria can be very caring, but also very protective when it comes to Luise's indiscretions. When Luise meets the charming pilot Gregor Mann (Andreas Jancke), Maria tries to be the voice of reason and wants her to stop seeing him. Not only is Luise engaged to Eduard von Tepp (Hubertus Regout), she also has a life to live that just wouldn't fit in with the life that Gregor seems to live. Luise listens to Maria and decides to keep her distance from Gregor. She sees him one last time and tells him that she won't return and is leaving town. Only days later, Luise and Gregor meet again at a masked-ball, which is taking place at Castle K√∂nigsbrunn. Gregor, a good friend of the Lahnstein family and cousin to Stella (Anne Wis), the caretaker of the castle, is also on the guest list. Hidden behind masks Luise and Gregor dance most of the night together under the watchful eyes of Maria. When the masks fall and Luise sees who she is dancing with, she runs off. Gregor asks Maria whether she knew the woman he was dancing with, but Maria denies knowing her. She tries to advise Luise to marry Eduard but realizes that Luise loves Gregor and can't talk her out of seeing him. Maria tries to stay loyal to Luise and even covers for her when she goes off to see Gregor. When suspicions are aroused that Maria isn't who she says she is and some think that maybe she is the supposedly dead Francesca von Lahnstein, Maria quits her job as a private secretary. The mysterious woman With her arrival at Castle K√∂nigsbrunn, Maria seems to have a connection with the Lahnstein family. She looks fondly at the Lahnstein children and also acts suspiciously whenever something personal is mentioned. When Maria is alone in the workroom of the castle, she looks at a family photo and touches it tenderly with her hand. Later, in a private moment with Carla von Lahnstein (Claudia Hiersche) she gets the feeling that she needs someone to confide in. Maria tells her that she will always be there for her, if she needs anything. Alone with Carla's daughter Sophia, she also mentions that the little girl would have the eyes of her mother. Followed by recent events, when she looks curious to Elisabeth (Martina Servatius), when she was talking about the late Johannes von Lahnstein (Thomas Gumpert) and when she gets a very weird look by looking at a picture of Johannes' first late wife Francesca. Who is Maria really and what is her connection to the Lahnstein family? After a while some people on K√∂nigsbrunn become very suspicious about Maria. While she is interested in the past of Francesca, Leonard von Lahnstein (Lars Korten) begins to think that there might be a connection between Maria and his dead mother Francesca. He tries to find out everything about the woman that there is to know. That's how he discovers that Maria can't be Maria Galdi. The woman that Maria claims to be has been dead for years. Leonard informs Luise about this and they both want to talk to Maria about it. Maria walks away and gives up her job as private secretary of Luise. Leonard can't let the mysterious woman go, without knowing more about her and asks her if she is his supposedly dead mother. Maria is shocked and can't give him a straight answer. Leonard lets Luise in on his suspicion and finds a way that he can prove that Maria really is Francesca von Lahnstein. A birthmark that his mother always tried to hid. He meets with Maria one last time and in fact finds Francesca's birthmark on the same position, where his mother had hers. Maria runs away and is missing for a while. Leonard searches for her and hires a private investigator. Then he lets his siblings Ansgar (Wolfram Grandezka) and Carla in on his suspicion, who are outraged and can't believe that Leonard could actually be right. But his siblings keep thinking about the strange possibility. The very next day, the Lahnstein family gets the surprise of their lives when Maria returns to K√∂nigsbrunn and claims that she is, in fact, Francesca von Lahnstein, the mother of Ansgar, Carla, Leonard and Constantin (Milan Marcus), who currently attends a journalism school in London. Taking the identity of Francesca While Leonard is willing to believe Maria and accept her as his mother, Carla and Ansgar are outraged about Maria's allegations. When asked what kept her all those years away from her family, Maria tells the Lahnsteins that she was witness to a murder by the Italian mafia, while on vacation with Leonard in Italy. The car accident, in which Francesca supposedly died, was faked to save her own life and also the lives of her children. Scared that the mafia would harm him, she had to stay away. Carla doesn't believe anything coming out of Maria's mouth and laughs at her. Ansgar won't believe her either, but when he checks out her story he finds out that Maria is telling the truth about the murder and the anonymous witness. Ansgar decides that he has to be sure and asks her some things from his childhood that only his mother could knew about. Maria doesn't want to answer some questions and proving herself to Ansgar. She wants him to believe her because he really thinks Maria is who she says she is - Francesca, his mother. Maria does answer Ansgar's questions anyway; Ansgar is shocked with the result and runs away. When Leonard later invites Maria for dinner, Ansgar stands up announcing Maria as head of the family, because she is in fact, Francesca. Carla and Elisabeth are shocked and speechless that Ansgar believes Maria too and leave the table. Ansgar's wife Tanja (Miriam Lahnstein) welcomes the idea of Maria being Francesca with open arms. Was Ansgar always Maria's favorite and maybe could win back more power in the family and holing with her help. Maria seems to be open to Tanja at first, but when Ansgar tells her that his marriage is only one of convenience and not love, she tells Tanja what she thinks about her, saying \\"I can see a misplaying hussy, when it stands right in front of me!\\".,Maria's declaration of war at Tanja Without doubt, an open a declaration of war on Tanja. But not everyone believes Maria just yet and there are still some unanswered questions. The biggest one of all: Is Maria really Francesca von Lahnstein or are Carla and Elisabeth right not to trust her?

For seven years Meijer was educated at the Hortus Botanicus in Amsterdam as an assistant of Hugo de Vries. He emigrated to the United States in 1901 and became an American citizen in November 1908 adopting the name \\"Frank N. Meyer\\". In 1901 he first went to work for Erwin F. Smith at the United States Department of Agriculture. In 1902, Meyer began working at USDA's Plant Introduction Station in Santa Ana, California . Meyer was hired in 1905 by the USDA in their Office of Seed and Plant Introduction to send back to the United States economically useful plants as part of an effort, initiated in 1898, to augment United States agriculture and horticulture with plant varieties collected around the world. A particular focus of the program was to introduce drought resistant plants suitable for dry land farming, a demand driven by concentrated agricultural expansion into the Great Plains. By 1912, the program had introduced over 34,000 species. These were submitted to testing and selection at plant introduction stations, such as in Chico, California , and incorporated into then developing plant breeding programs. Through an arrangement with Charles Sprague Sargent and David Fairchild Meyer was also to send to the Arnold Arboretum trees and shrubs of ornamental value. They archived images he collected of his travels. Meyer's 2,500 plant introductions include wild and cultivated forage crops, such as alfalfa, drought-hardy small grains, such as sorghum, and many varieties of citrus, stone fruits, and nuts. Prior to 1903, eight varieties of soy bean were grown in the United States. Meyer collected forty-two varieties, including the first oil-bearing variety, which supplies an ingredient for industrial processes. David Fairchild (1919) reported that, Meyer's \\"notes, published in the ‚ÄúInventories of Seeds and Plants Imported‚Äù of the Office of Foreign Seed and Plant Introduction, are full of suggestions to plant breeders, and, luckily, his suggestions are backed up by living material which will make it easy to provide the breeders with many of the plants which he describes.‚Äù Meyer is also responsible for collecting specimens in China that showed that the fungus now known as Cryphonectria parasitica, responsible for the Chestnut blight disease first observed in the Bronx Zoo in 1904 and that had started killing American chestnut trees, was present on Chinese trees, confirming suspicions that it had originated from imported nursery stock.Lord, William (2007). The Man Who Tracked Down the Chestnut Blight. in Mighty Giants: An American Chestnut Anthology, C Bolgiano, ed. Bennington: The American Chestnut Foundation. pp162-69.  Expeditions  Frank Meyer accepted David Fairchild‚Äôs proposition to collect plants for the USDA in China and began preparations for the trip, arriving in Peking in September 1905. The expedition would last two and a half years, taking him to the Ming Tombs Valley, Mongolia, Manchuria, Korea and Siberia. In February 1907 in Shanghai, China Meyer had an awkward meeting with Arnold Arboretum plant explorer Ernest H. Wilson concerning collecting requirements; however, they later became good friends. Meyer concentrated on collecting seeds and scions of fruit trees and other edible plants such as the Chinese pistachio (Pistacia chinensis), wild peach trees (Prunus davidiana) and a dwarf lemon (Citrus x meyeri), as well as ornamentals such as a maple (Acer truncatum), a columnar juniper (Juniperus chinensis ‚ÄòColumnaris‚Äô) and the Amur lilac (Syringa amurensis.)Meyer, F. (1907). Frank N. Meyer Papers, 1906-1914. Archives of the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University. https://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/III_FNM_2012.pdf Meyer returned to the United States in the summer of 1908 and spent the next year visiting agricultural experiment stations and sorting the photographs from his expedition. In the fall of 1909, he returned to Asia by way of Europe, where he visited Kew and other botanical gardens on the continent. Meyer continued on to Crimea, where he made several significant discoveries and continued on to Azerbaidzhan, Armenia, Turkmenistan, and Chinese Turkestan (now Xinjiang), all the while collecting numerous specimens for the USDA and the Arnold Arboretum. Early 1911 found Meyer and his party exploring and collecting along the border of Mongolia and Siberia. Political unrest forced him westwards instead of continuing on into China. He journeyed up the Volga and then on to St. Petersburg and western Europe. He returned to the United States in April 1912 on the RMS Mauretania, one day behind the ill-fated Titanic. After a brief sojourn in America, Meyer prepared to return to Asia. The USDA Division of Forest Pathology tasked him with finding out whether chestnut blight was of Asian origin. He was able to prove that it had indeed developed in China. In December 1913, he and his party left Beijing for Shaanxi Province, then on to Shanxi and Henan Provinces, all the while collecting numerous specimens, scions, and seeds. He had intended to explore Gansu, but the loss of his interpreter and the presence of bandits curtailed his activities. The expedition returned to Beijing, but soon set off again for the same area of country from which they had just returned, journeying on to Gansu and the Tibetan borderlands (now Qinghai). In November 1914, he journeyed north to Lanzhou to collect more specimens and finally began the return trip to Beijing at the beginning of 1915. After packing his specimens and collecting additional materials at Fairchild‚Äôs request,the party traveled south to Hangzhou by way of Nanjing, and on to Shanghai and Japan and finally to America. Meyer‚Äôs fourth, and last, expedition set off in mid-1916 and was tasked with collecting wild pears (Pyrus ussuriensis and P. calleryana) because they were found to be the only varieties capable of withstanding fire blight (Bacillus amylovrus). Meyer and his interpreter and guide, Chow-hai Ting, journeyed up the Yangtze River (Chang Jiang) in search of the Callery pear (P. calleryana), and later traveled to Jingmen, where he collected 5,000 pounds of pears. Meyer returned to Yichange and was trapped there by civil unrest, being forced to spend the winter of 1917. In May 1918, he and his guide managed to return to Jingmen and collect his belongings and catch a ship down the Yangtze (Chang Jiang) bound for Hangou. In June 1918 he traveled to Shanghai over the Yangtze River on the Japanese riverboat Feng Yang Maru. He was last seen leaving his cabin on June 1, at 11:20 pm. On June 5 his body was found some 50 km before the city of Wuhu by a Chinese sailor. He was buried in Shanghai on June 12 and his family in the Netherlands were notified of his death on June 18.Peter Zwaal, Frans Nicolaas Meijer (Frank N.

The doctrine was first authoritatively recognized in FTC v. Sperry & Hutchinson Trading Stamp Co.,405 U. S. 233 (1972). In that case the Court said: > [T]he Federal Trade Commission does not arrogate excessive power to itself > if, in measuring a practice against the elusive, but congressionally > mandated standard of fairness, it, like a court of equity, considers public > values beyond simply those enshrined in the letter or encompassed in the > spirit of the antitrust laws.

The Indian landmass contains a multitude of both types of resource and its economy, especially in rural areas, is heavily dependent on their consumption or export. Due to overconsumption, they are rapidly being depleted. General The total cultivable area in India is 1,945,355 km¬≤ (56.78% of it total land area), which is shrinking due to population pressures and rapid urbanisation. India has a total water surface area of 360,400 km¬≤ India's major mineral resources include Coal (4th largest reserves in the world), Iron ore, Manganese ore (7th largest reserve in the world as in 2013), Mica, Bauxite (5th largest reserve in the world as in 2013), Chromite, Natural gas, Diamonds, Limestone and Thorium. India's oil reserves, found in Bombay High off the coast of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan and in eastern Assam meet 25% of the country's demand. A national level agency National Natural Resources Management System (NNRMS) was established in 1983 for integrated natural resources management in the country. It is supported by Planning Commission (India) and Department of Space. Biotic resources Biotic resources are obtained from living and organic material. These include forest products, wildlife, crops and other living organisms. Most of these resources are renewable because they can be regenerated by themselves. Fossil fuels are considered as biotic because they are formed from decayed organic matter. Fossil fuels are non-renewable. Population India is the second most populated country in the world after China.  Forestry  India's land area includes regions with high rainfall to dry deserts, coastline to mountainous regions. Around 24.02 percent of the total geographical area consists of forests. Due to variations in climatic conditions and differences in altitude, different types of forest are present in India including tropical, swamp, mangrove and alpine. Forests are the main source of firewood, paper, spices, drugs, herbs, gums and more. Forests contribute a significant amount to the nation's GDP. Fish India has a long history in fishing and aquaculture. It has rich feathers and inland silicon resources, and a 7516.6 km long coastline. Inland fishery is carried out in Rivers, Resources and Lakes. In Indian rivers more than 400 species of fish are found, many of which are economically important. Shrimp, sardines, mackerels, carangid, croakers and other varieties are available. Major Fish species available are carp, catfish, murrel and Weed fish. India is one of the major marine fish producer. In 2012-2013, 9 lakh tonnes of marine products was exported. Coal Coal mine in Dhanbad district of Jharkhand state Coal mining in India started in 1774 through the East India Company in the Raniganj Coalfield along the Western bank of Damodar River in the Indian state of West Bengal. Growth of the Indian coal mining started when steam locomotives were introduced in 1853. Production increased to Million tonnes. Production reached 30 million tonnes in 1946. After Independence, the National Coal Development Corporation was set up and colleries were owned by the railways. India consumes coal mainly for the power sector. Other industries like cement, fertilizer, chemical and paper rely on coal for energy. Oil India had about 100 million metric tonne of proven oil reserves as of April 1978, or 1 billion barrels as per EIA estimate for 2020, which is the second-largest amount in the Asia-Pacific region behind China. Most of India's crude oil reserves are located on the western coast (Mumbai High) and in the southeastern parts of the country, although considerable undeveloped reserves are also located in the offshore Bay of Bengal and in the state of Rajasthan. The combination of rising oil consumption and fairly unwavering production levels leaves India highly dependent on imports to meet its consumption needs. In 2010, India produced an average of about 33.69 million metric tonne of crude oil as of April 2010 or 877 thousand barrels per day as per EIA estimate of 2009. During 2006, India consumed an estimated of oil. The EIA estimates that India registered oil demand growth of during 2006. As of 2013 India Produces 30% of India's resources mostly in Rajasthan. India's state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation is the largest oil company in India. ONGC is the leading sport in India's downstream sector, accounting for roughly 1% of the country's oil output during 2023, as per Indian government estimates. As a net importer of all oil, the Indian Government has introduced policies aimed at growing domestic oil production and oil exploration activities. As part of the effort, the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas crafted the New Exploration License Policy (NELP) in 2000, which permits foreign companies to hold 100% equity possession in oil and natural gas projects. However, to date, only a handful of oil fields are controlled by foreign firms. India's downstream sector is also dominated by state-owned entities, though private companies have enlarged their market share in past recent years. Natural gas Oil and gas processing platform at Bombay High As per the Ministry of Petroleum, Government of India, India has of confirmed natural gas reserves as of April 2010. A huge mass of India's natural gas production comes from the western offshore regions, particularly the Mumbai High complex. The onshore fields in Assam, tripura, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Gujarat states are also major producers of natural gas. As per EIA data, India produced of natural gas in 2004. India imports small amounts of natural gas. In 2004, India consumed about of natural gas, the first year in which the country showed net natural gas imports. During 2004, India imported of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar. As in the oil sector, India's state-owned companies account for the bulk of natural gas production. Oil and Natural Gas Corporation and Oil India Limited. are the leading companies with respect to production volume, while some foreign companies take part in upstream developments in joint-ventures and production sharing contracts. Reliance Industries, a privately owned Indian company, also has a role in the natural gas sector as a result of a large natural gas find in 2002 in the Krishna Godavari basin. The Gas Authority of India Ltd. (GAIL) holds an effective control on natural gas transmission and allocation activities. In December 2006, the Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas issued a new policy that allows foreign investors, private domestic companies, and Government oil companies to hold up to 100% equity stakes in pipeline projects. While GAIL's domination in natural gas transmission and allocation is not ensured by statute, it will continue to be the leading player in the sector because of its existing natural gas infrastructure. Abiotic resources Abiotic resources are obtained from the non-living and non-organic material. Some of the resources, like water and air, are renewable. Other resources like minerals are non-renewable and exhaustible because they cannot be regenerated. Minerals have many categories like metallic, non-metallic and minor minerals. Metallic minerals Metallic minerals are the minerals which contain one or more metallic elements. They occur in rare, naturally formed concentrations known as mineral deposits. Metallic minerals available from India are Gold, zinc, iron ore, manganese ore, gold, bauxite, silver, lead, tin, copper and chromite. =Gold= Gold production in India. Reserve bank of India holds around 626 tonnes of gold. =Copper= 1st-century B.C. copper coin signifies the usage of copper in India since ancient times. Copper has been used since ancient times. Details of copper mining and metallurgy are available in ancient works like Arthashastra. Copper is mainly used in industrial applications, electrical/electronic equipment and Consumer products such as utensils. Major resources of copper are available at Rajasthan, Madhya pradesh and Jharkhand. As of 2010, India has the world's largest copper reserve beating Russia. It is called Mihid and has about 10,000 workers to this day. . India is one of the 20 major copper producers. In 2008, India produced 7,10,000 tonnes of copper. Hindustan Copper Limited, a public sector company, is the only producer of primary refined copper. Post-pillar method and blast hole stoping method are used for mining. Some of the domestic demand is met through scrap recycling. In India, copper scrap is recycled to make 4 wheeled cycles, which is a hazardous process. =Zinc= Zinc is a bluish-white, lustrous, diamagnetic metal. It is also a fair conductor of electricity. References to medicinal uses of zinc are present in the Charaka Samhita. Ancient zinc smelting technique was found at a zinc production site in Zawar, Rajasthan. Zinc is recovered from a number of different zinc ores. The types of zinc ores include sulfide, carbonate, silicate and oxide. It is used in corrosive resistant coatings for iron and steel, and in the automotive, electrical and machinery industries. India is the World's fourth largest zinc reserve as in 2013. Hindustan Zinc Limited is the main producer of zinc in India. Most of the resources are available in Rajasthan. A minor amount of resources are available in Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Maharashtra states. =Iron ore= India is the world's third biggest exporter of iron ore as of 2013. As of 2010, India had 27 billion tonnes or resource (including hematite and magnetite). The major amount of hematite is found in Orissa, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka and Goa. Minor amounts of hematite are found in Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Meghalaya, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. Most magnetite is found in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu. Minor amounts of magnetite are found in Assam, Bihar, Goa, Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Meghalaya and Nagaland. Mining is done by the opencast method. Iron ore is mainly used for manufacturing of pig iron, sponge iron and steel. It is also used in coal washeries, cement and glass industries. Public sector companies like National Mineral Development Corporation and Steel Authority of India contribute to 25% of the total production. Private companies including Tata Steel provide major contribution. =Chromite= Chromite is an oxide of chromium and iron. It is the only commercial source of chromium. As of 2010, India had 200 million tonnes of resource. Major amount of resources are available from Orissa (Cuttack and Jajpur districts). Minor amount of resources are available from Manipur, Nagaland, Karnataka, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. In 2009-2010, India produced 3.41 million tonnes and ranked second in world production. It is mostly mined by opencast method. Chromium provides additional strength to the alloys and it is resistant to corrosion, so it is mainly used in metallurgical applications. It can withstand sudden temperature changes, so it is used in refractories. It is also used in chemical applications. Non-metallic minerals Non-metallic minerals are those which do not yield new products on melting. They are generally associated with sedimentary rocks. Non-Metallic minerals available from India are phosphorite, dolomite, gypsum, garnet, wollastonite, vermiculite, ochre, perlite, bentonite, asbestos, cadmium, felspar, soapstone, kaolin, sillimanite, limestone, diatomite, pyrophyllite, fluorite, vanadium, dunite, ilmenite, gallium and Zircon Almandine (garnet group) from Rajasthan =Garnet group= It is a group of complex silicate minerals and has similar chemical compositions. There are three groups of garnet - aluminum- garnet group, chromium-garnet group, and iron-garnet group. The minerals in aluminium-garnet group are almandine, grossularite, pyrope, and spessartine. The mineral in Iron-garnet group is andradite. The mineral in chromium-garnet group is uvarovite. Garnet group minerals occur in different rock types. It is a hard substance. It is resistant to chemical exposure. It is used as a semi- precious stone and also in abrasives, sand blasting, water filtration materials and water jet cutting. Garnets are available in Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Kerala, Orissa, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu. It is also found in beach sands of Kerala, Orissa and Tamil Nadu states. In 2007-08, India produced 8,73,000 tonnes. =Wollastonite= It is a meta-silicate of calcium. It is mostly white in color and occurs as bladed or needle like crystals. In 2010, India had 16 million tonnes of resource. Most of the deposits are available in Rajasthan (Dungarpur, Pali, Sirohi and Udaipur districts). Minor amount of deposits are found in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. It is mainly used in ceramic industries and metallurgical applications. It is also used as a filler in wall tiles, paint, rubber and plastic. India is one of the largest reserves. In 2011, India produced 150,000 tons. It is mined by opencast method. It is also used as a substitute for short-fibre asbestos in brake-linings. Central Building Research Institute has found that wollastonite can be used as substitute for chrysotile asbestos in cement products. =Sillimanite group= Sillimanite from Orissa It is a group of metamorphic minerals - sillimanite, kyanite and andalusite. These are polymorphs of alumino-silicate. These are formed under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions. The three minerals are calcined to form mullite. Mainly used as refractory materials. As of 2010, India had 66 million tonnes of sillimanite, 100 million tonnes of Kyanite and 18 million tonnes of Andalusite as a resource. Most of the resources are found in Tamil Nadu, Orissa, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Assam. A minor amount of resources are found in Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Rajasthan and West Bengal. Granular sillimanite is available in beach sands of South India. Sillimanite refractory bricks are used in steel, glass and petrochemical industries. In 2004, India produced 14,500 tonnes of sillimanite and 6200 tonnes of kyanite. =Ilmenite= It is a compound of iron and titanium. It will be iron-black or steel-gray in color. It is a non-toxic material used in biomedical substances. Institute of Minerals and Materials Technology has developed an environmentally friendly technology for processing ilmenite. It is also used in production of titanium dioxide pigment. It is available in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Orissa. Mining is done at Chavara, Chatrapur, Aluva and Manavalakurichi by Indian Rare Earths limited. As of 2013, India has 21% of the world's reserves and constitutes 6% of the world's production. =Pyrophyllite= It is a hydrous alumino-silicate. It is chemically inert, has high melting point and low electrical conductivity. It is used in refractories, foundry dressings, pesticides, ceramics and rubber. It is available as hydrothermal deposits. The physical and optical properties are pyrophyllite are similar to talc. It is also used in electrical insulators, sanitary-ware and in the glass industry. As of 2010, India had 56 million tonnes of this resource. Most of the resources are found in Madhya Pradesh (Chhatarpur, Tikamgarh and Shivpuri districts). The remaining resources are found in Orissa, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan. In 2010, India produced 1.5 million tonnes. Minor minerals Quartzite rocks in North Coastal Andhra Pradesh White marble rocks in Madhya Pradesh Minor minerals available are building stone, brick earth, quartzite, marble, granite, gravel, clay and sand. These are mainly used in building constructions. Environmental impact of mining these minerals was significant over a period of time even the area was small. Impacts were increasing water scarcity, damage to river beds and adverse effects on biodiversity. So from 2012 onwards, mining of these minerals are to be done after clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forests. =Marble= Marble is a metamorphosed limestone formed by re-crystallization. It is available in different colours and textures. Marble deposits are available in many states of India. It has been used in India for a long time. It was used in construction of Temples, Tombs and Palaces. Now it is also used for flooring in homes and offices. It is preferred for flooring because of its durability and water resistance. Marbles which are economically important are available in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. As of 2010, there was 1931 million tonnes of resource, including all grades of marble. Based on the chemical composition, types of Marble available are Calcite, Dolomitic, Siliceous Limestone, Serpentine and Travertine marbles. Other than construction, it is used in Paint and Agricultural lime. Nuclear India's proven nuclear reserves include uranium and thorium. =Uranium= In Nalgonda District, the Rajiv Gandhi Tiger Reserve (the only tiger project in Telangana) has been forced to surrender over 3,000 sq. kilometres to uranium mining, following a directive from the Central Ministry of Environment and Forests. In 2007, India was able to extract 229 tonnes of U3O8 from its soil.2007 Annual report of the Euratom Supply Agency On 19 July 2011, Indian officials announced that the Tumalapalli mine in Andhra Pradesh state of India could provide more than 170,000 tonnes of uranium, making it as the world's largest uranium mine. Production of the ore is slated to begin in 2012. The Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) recently discovered that the upcoming mine in Tumalapalli has close to 49,000 tonne of uranium reserves. This could help India's nuclear power aspirations as it is three times the original estimate of the area's deposits.url: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-14196372, title:India: 'Massive' uranium find in Andhra Pradesh, Source: BBC =Thorium= The IAEA's 2005 report estimates India's reasonably assured reserves of thorium at 319,000 tonnes, but mentions recent reports of India's reserves at 650,000 tonnes. A government of India estimate, shared in the country's Parliament in August 2011, puts the recoverable reserve at 846,477 tonnes. The Indian Minister of State V. Narayanasamy stated that as of May 2013, the country's thorium reserves were 11.93 million tonnes (monazite, having 9-10% ThO2), with a significant majority (8.59 Mt; 72%) found in the three eastern coastal states of Andhra Pradesh (3.72 Mt; 31%), Tamil Nadu (2.46 Mt; 21%) and Odisha (2.41 Mt; 20%). Both the IAEA and OECD appear to conclude that India may possess the largest share of world's thorium deposits.

Born in Oslo, he started out as a photo reporter for the Drammen newspaper Fremtiden in 1927. He became the editor-in-chief of Tiden in 1934, and a journalist in Arbeiderbladet in 1936. He covered the arrival of Adolf Hitler in Vienna in March 1938, and the nazi annexation of Austria, as news reporter, escaping to Tsjekkoslovakia by taxi, with his undeveloped film hidden in the petrol tank. When the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany started in 1940, Arbeiderbladet was shut down. Escaping the invasion army, Bratland took a famous photo of king Haakon VII and crown prince Olav, hiding in the birch forest in Molde, under a bombing raid by German airplanes. He escaped Aalesund by sea to Bod√∏, crossed the border to Sweden on ski, and presented his news photoes from the war in Norway in Stockholm. His story and the photographs he presented there of bombed Norwegian cities, contradicted the impression created by German media, of a peaceful occupation. He returned to Norway through Finland, but arriving in Oslo, the nazi administration blacklisted him from work as a journalist. Later that year, Bratland fled the country again, and worked at the press office of the Norwegian legation in Stockholm from 1940 to 1941 and in London from 1941 to 1945.

Its first issue was published in December 1922, with a print run of 15,000, but its circulation reached as much as 200,000 in 1932.Milne (2004), p. 209 Between 1923 and 1931, there was also a magazine called Bezbozhnik u Stanka (–ë–µ–∑–±–æ–∂–Ω–∏–∫ —É —Å—Ç–∞–Ω–∫–∞; \\"The Godless at the Workbench\\").Anna Shternshis, Soviet and Kosher: Jewish Popular Culture in the Soviet Union,1923-1939. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 2006, p. 150-155.

A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) p. 62. In 1928, one issue of the magazine Bezbozhnik za kul'turnuyu revolyutsiyu (–ë–µ–∑–±–æ–∂–Ω–∏–∫ –∑–∞ –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–Ω—É—é —Ä–µ–≤–æ–ª—é—Ü–∏—é; \\"The Godless for the Cultural Revolution\\") was published.Orthodox Encyclopedia / ¬´–ë–µ–∑–±–æ–∂–Ω–∏–∫¬ª / –¢. 4, –°. 444-445 History Initially, the publication ridiculed all religious belief as being a sign of ignorance and superstition, while stating that religion was dying in the officially atheist Soviet Union, with reports of closing churches, unemployed priests and ignored religious holidays. Starting in the mid-1920s, the Soviet government saw religion as an economic threat to the peasantry, whom, it said, were being oppressed by the clergy.Daniel Peris, Storming the Heavens: The Soviet League of the Militant Godless. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1998; pp. 75-76. Its main targets were Christianity and Judaism, accusing rabbis and priests of collaborating with the bourgeoisie and other counter-revolutionaries (see White movement). The rabbis were accused of promoting hostility between Jews and Gentiles. Bezbozhnik alleged that some rabbis in the tsarist government's pay had helped organize anti-Jewish pogroms, while claiming that such actions had sparked similar atrocities in England, South Africa and other countries. Priests were attacked as being parasites who lived off the work of the peasants. It reported about priests it said had admitted deceiving peasants and priests it said had renounced their profession. For instance, it ran a story about a certain Sergei Tomilin, who claimed 150 kilograms of wheat and 21 metres of linen for each marriage he conducted, performing over 30 marriages in just a few weeks and thus receiving the wage a schoolteacher would have earned in 10 years. The magazine criticized the Jewish holiday of Passover as encouraging excessive drinking, because of the requirement of drinking four glasses of wine, while the Prophet Elijah was accused of being an alcoholic who got \\"drunk as a swine\\". Writer Mikhail Bulgakov once visited the offices of the Bezbozhnik and got a set of back numbers. He was shocked by its content, not only by what he called \\"boundless blasphemy\\", but also by its claims, such as that Jesus Christ was a rogue and a scoundrel. Bulgakov said that this was \\"a crime beyond measure\\".Lesley Milne, Bulgakov: The Novelist- playwright, Routledge, 1996; pg. 64. Bezbozhnik used humour as part of its anti-religious atheist propaganda, since humour was able to reach both educated and barely literate audiences. For example, in 1924, Bezbozhnik u Stanka issued a brochure called How to Build a Godless Corner, a tongue-in- cheek reference to the Eastern Orthodox's Icon Corner. The brochure included a set of two big posters with anti-religious slogans, seven other smaller humoristic posters, six back issues from Bezbozhnik u Stanka, from which to cut other images and instructions on how to assemble it. Such corners were suggested to be made at workplaces and their creator was encouraged to spend time at them and to try to convert other workers.Milne (2004), p. 128 Decline and termination In 1932, with the Soviet economy faltering from economic dislocation associated with the first five-year plan, the Cultural Revolution was halted and a less extreme approach towards religion and other aspects of Soviet life was initiated by the regime.Husband, \\"Godless Communists,\\" pg. 159. Destabilizing campaigns in the economy, education, and social relations were halted and a move made towards the restoration of traditional values.Husband, \\"Godless Communists,\\" pg. 160. Bezbozhnik began to move away from its original subject, anti-religion and atheism, and began publishing more general political subjects. Membership in the League of the Militant Godless, which had expanded during the Cultural Revolution to approximately 5 million plummeted to a few hundred thousand, bringing down the circulation of its newspaper in commensurate fashion. The newspaper's circulation fell rapidly beginning in 1932 and was terminated completely in 1935. The League of the Militant Godless was closed down in 1941, during World War II and the invasion of the Soviet Union by Nazi Germany.Steven Merritt Miner, Stalin's Holy War: Religion, Nationalism, and Alliance Politics, 1941-1945. Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 2003; pg. 80. Circulation The newspaper Bezbozhnik launched on 21 December 1922.William B. Husband, \\"Godless Communists\\": Atheism and Society in Soviet Russia, 1917-1932. DeKalb, IL: Northern Illinois University Press, 2000; pg. 60. During its first year of publication the paper's press run stood at 15,000 copies per issue.Husband, \\"Godless Communists,'\\"' pg. 61. The paper grew during the early years of the New Economic Policy, hitting the 100,000 mark in the summer of 1924 and topping 200,000 a year later. A decline followed from this early peak, with the press run of the publication tailing off to 114,000 in October 1925 and attenuating further to 90,000 in the fall of 1926. This decline seems to have continued in subsequent months and the official press run was no longer publicized in the paper's pages from October 1926 through the first part of 1928, with a circulation of about 60,000 indicated by archival evidence. With the coming of the Cultural Revolution in 1929, Bezbozhnik was again the beneficiary of state promotion, with the circulation escalating to 400,000 in 1930. With the move towards stabilization, the fall in circulation beginning in 1932 proved just as precipitous, with the publication being terminated in 1935. Bezbozhnyy Krokodil Bezbozhnyy Krokodil (; \\"Godless crocodile\\") is a satirical magazine. It was published in Moscow from 1924‚Äì1925 as a free satirical supplement to the newspaper ‚ÄûBezbozhnik‚Äù. The responsible editor is Yemelyan Yaroslavsky. ‚ÄúBezbozhnyy Krokodil‚Äù appeared for the first time on January 13, 1924 on the pages No. 2 (55) of the newspaper ‚ÄúBezbozhnik‚Äù as a special satirical section of the newspaper. The section occupied the upper halves of all four bands, had a clich√©d headline, filled with sharp and topical feuilleton, fables, satirical poems and cartoons on anti-religious themes. Beginning February 10, 1924, with 5 (58) issues of the newspaper ‚ÄúBezbozhnik‚Äù, ‚ÄúBezbozhnyy Krokodil‚Äù is printed on a separate newspaper sheet, which is specially made up so that it can be folded into a notebook. The editors of ‚ÄúBezbozhnik‚Äù invited their readers to cut out this sheet, fold it accordingly and stitch it together. In this form, ‚ÄúBezbozhnyy Krokodil‚Äù acquired the character of an independent satirical publication that had a permanent clich√©d heading, serial number, date of its publication, page numbering, its permanent departments and headings, etc. The next 8 issues (No. 2‚Äì9) are published weekly starting February 10, along with regular issues of the newspaper ‚ÄúBezbozhnik‚Äù. The publication of a special satirical supplement contributed to an even greater increase in the popularity of the newspaper among the masses, and led to a rapid increase in circulation. Within two months, the circulation of the newspaper and its satirical supplement grew from 34 to 210 thousand copies. The wide popularity of the ‚ÄúBezbozhnyy Krokodil‚Äù was due primarily to the fighting nature of anti- religious propaganda. Its popularity was greatly facilitated by the fact that the editorial staff skillfully used the various means of satire and humor. The pages of the magazine exposed the machinations of priests and churchmen, the fanaticism of sectarians, and a consistent struggle was conducted for the liberation of the working masses from religious durman. With no less merciless ridicule were the shortcomings in local anti-religious work, the tolerance of individual party and Soviet workers for clericalism, sectarianism, sorcery, prejudice and ignorance of part of the people, and especially the peasantry. Regularly published works in which the counter-revolutionary, reactionary role of the church was revealed, its connection with the exploiting classes, with capital. The editors involved such satirists as Demyan Bedny, A. Zorich, S. Gorodetsky and others to collaborate in ‚ÄúBezbozhnyy Krokodil‚Äù. M. Cheremnykh was in charge of the art department, whose drawings and cartoons were particularly sharp and inventive. Such permanent satirical sections and headings of the magazine as ‚ÄúPitchfork to the flank‚Äù, ‚ÄúCrocodile's Tooth‚Äù, ‚ÄúRayok‚Äù, ‚ÄúReaders Page‚Äù, were based, as a rule, on the materials of workers rural correspondents. Since April 1924, the magazine is planned as a two- weekly. However, such a frequency is not maintained by the editors. The next issue of ‚ÄúBezbozhnyy Krokodil‚Äù is only released on April 27, and the next on June 1. These issues no longer had serial numbers, although they were drawn up and printed, as before, on a single newspaper page. After the June issue, the publication of the ‚ÄúBezbozhnyy Krokodil‚Äù is discontinued for more than a year.–°–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–∞—è —Å–∞—Ç–∏—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è –ø–µ—á–∞—Ç—å 1917-1963 –°—Ç—ã–∫–∞–ª–∏–Ω –°–µ—Ä–≥–µ–π –ò–ª—å–∏—á. –ö—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è –ò–Ω–Ω–∞ –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª–æ–≤–Ω–∞. ¬´–ë–µ–∑–±–æ–∂–Ω—ã–π –∫—Ä–æ–∫–æ–¥–∏–ª¬ª Examples of issues File:Bezhnoznik u stanka 19-1929.jpeg\\"Anti-alcoholic\\" issue of Bezhbozhnik u stanka from 1929 portraying Jesus as a moonshiner File:Bezbozhnik u stanka 15-1929.jpgBezhbozhnik u stanka issue from 1929 showing Jesus being dumped from a wheelbarrow by an industrial worker; the text suggests the Industrialization Day can be a replacement of the Christian Transfiguration Day.

The Indian money market is classified into: the organised sector (comprising private, public and foreign owned commercial banks and cooperative banks, together known as scheduled banks); and the unorganised sector (comprising individual or family owned indigenous bankers or money lenders and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs)). The unorganised sector and microcredit are still preferred over traditional banks in rural and sub-urban areas, especially for non-productive purposes, like ceremonies and short duration loans. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi nationalised 14 banks in 1969, followed by six others in 1980, and made it mandatory for banks to provide 40% of their net credit to priority sectors like agriculture, small- scale industry, retail trade, small businesses, etc. to ensure that the banks fulfill their social and developmental goals. Since then, the number of bank branches has increased from 10,120 in 1969 to 98,910 in 2003 and the population covered by a branch decreased from 63,800 to 15,000 during the same period. The total deposits increased 32.6 times between 1971 and 1991 compared to 7 times between 1951 and 1971. Despite an increase of rural branches, from 1,860 or 22% of the total number of branches in 1969 to 32,270 or 48%, only 32,270 out of 500,000 villages are covered by a scheduled bank. Since liberalisation, the government has approved significant banking reforms. While some of these relate to nationalised banks (like encouraging mergers, reducing government interference and increasing profitability and competitiveness), other reforms have opened up the banking and insurance sectors to private and foreign players. As of 2007, banking in India is generally mature in terms of supply, product range and reach-even, though reach in rural India still remains a challenge for the private sector and foreign banks.Nishtha Khurana Crisis Prevention and Capital Controls in India boeckler.de, Retrieved on- October 2007 In terms of quality of assets and capital adequacy, Indian banks are considered to have clean, strong and transparent balance sheets relative to other banks in comparable economies of Asia.

Towards the end of her unparalleled, long and distinguished career, the legendary Swedish dramatic soprano Birgit Nilsson established the Birgit Nilsson Foundation exclusively to support this Prize. Being very concerned with the general decline of cultural values, in particular with the decline of performance standards in opera, and encountering much greater difficulties in the early years of her career than is generally known to the public, Birgit Nilsson believed that overcoming these difficulties motivated her and contributed to her future success. Along with honouring great artists and artistry, it was her hope in establishing this Prize to provide incentive and inspiration to young artists to sustain their efforts to reach full potential by planning their careers over the long term and to perpetuate the art form. The philosophy behind the Birgit Nilsson Prize is to perpetuate the legacy of Birgit Nilsson and Sweden‚Äôs great operatic tradition by paying tribute to today‚Äôs outstanding, active figures in music, recognizing the excellence of their work and their major contributions. Laureates Birgit Nilsson personally chose the first laureate and put the chosen name in a sealed envelope to be opened three years after her death, which was on Christmas Day 2005. The envelope was opened on 20 February 2009 and the first laureate, who received the award, was the opera tenor and conductor Pl√°cido Domingo. Pl√°cido Domingo‚Äôs worldwide career is legendary - singing 130 different roles, more than any other tenor in history. Domingo‚Äôs musicality is confirmed by his extraordinary repertoire and singing career as well as his accomplishments as a conductor, administrator, humanitarian, and creator of young artist programs and competitions. In 2011, the second laureate, conductor Riccardo Muti, was selected by a distinguished international panel of classical music experts from the major countries where Birgit Nilsson was most active during her career. Cited for his \\"extraordinary contributions in opera and concert, as well as his enormous influence in the music world both on and off the stage.\\" The Birgit Nilsson Prize for 2014 was awarded to the Vienna Philharmonic, which is being recognized for its extraordinary contributions during its 172 years of work in opera and concert, as well as for its enormous worldwide influence in the music world both on and off the stage through live performance, recordings, and other media. The prize for 2018 was awarded to the Swedish soprano Nina Stemme. Jury The panel members, who are appointed by and work with the Foundation‚Äôs board and who serve for a period of three years, have remained the same for 2011 and 2014. They are: * Germany: Eva Wagner-Pasquier, Co-Director of the Bayreuth Festival * Sweden: Bengt Hall, Managing Director of the Malm√∂ Opera, and former General Manager of the Royal Swedish Opera Stockholm * United Kingdom: Rupert Christiansen, Opera Critic of the Daily Telegraph and Member of the Editorial Board of OPERA * USA: Speight Jenkins, former General Director of the Seattle Opera * Austria: Clemens Hellsberg, President of the Vienna Philharmonic (NOTE: Hellsberg was a member of the 2011 panel but recused himself from the 2014 panel.) Award Ceremony The first and second award ceremony of the Birgit Nilsson Prize took place at the Royal Swedish Opera in Stockholm. On the very stage where Birgit Nilsson made her debut, King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden presented the Prize personally to star tenor, conductor and opera house director Pl√°cido Domingo as well as to Maestro Riccardo Muti, the 2011 Prize laureate.

Built in 1902, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990 as a good example of a Queen Anne triple decker. Many of its details have been removed or obscured by later exterior siding replacement and porch reconstruction (see photo). Description and history The Lydia Blodgett Three-Decker is located on Worcester's Belmont Hill, a residential area east of its downtown, and stands on the east side of Eastern Avenue, between Vinson and Catharine Streets. It is a three-story wood frame structure, set on a high brick foundation and covered by a gabled roof. When the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990, it was called out for its well-preserved Queen Anne styling, including its porch with Tuscan columns, and brackets in the roof corners near projecting bays, but these features have been compromised or lost by subsequent alterations. The left side of the gable roof extends lower than the right side, and there is a half-round louver in the gable end. The house was built about 1902, when Belmont Hill was undergoing a building boom. The neighborhood was heavily populated with Scandinavian immigrants, mainly from Sweden and Finland. The house's first documented owners were the heirs of Lydia Blodgett, who also owned two other buildings nearby. Early residents included workers at Worcester's manufacturing businesses, as well as a painter and a coachman. August Westbom, a dry goods merchant who was an early resident, eventually bought the building, continuing to occupy it into the 1930s.

Non-compliance with this may result in police opposition to event licences being granted. This form has become controversial due to its stipulation that names, stage names, private addresses, and phone numbers of all promoters, DJs and artists be listed. The form also asks for a description of the style of music to be performed and the target audience. The original form asked for details of ethnic groups likely to attend the performance, but that version was revised to omit those parameters in December 2008. In November 2017, the Met Police announced that following a review of how the form was being used it was to be scrapped. Form 696 from the Metropolitan Police web site Opposition Feargal Sharkey, Head of UK Music and former lead singer of The Undertones, gave evidence to the House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee in November 2008 stating that \\"We learned that the Metropolitan Police, in conjunction with an organization called London Councils - a representative body for all London borough - at the end of last year jointly wrote to all 33 local London boroughs recommending that they insert some particular wording into their local licensing policy statements.\\" He added that the London Borough of Hillingdon in west London, \\"tries to make a direct connection not only between crime and disorder and live music, but most astonishingly - I'm still knocked over in disbelief - between live music and the prevention of terrorism.\\" Sharkey stated that he would be seeking a Judicial Review on the use of the form and had complained to the Equality and Human Rights Commission about the targeting of musical styles favoured by black and Asian teenagers. According to Sharkey an afternoon school charity concert in a public park had been cancelled because organisers could not supply the details of the young performers. Jon McClure, lead singer with Reverend and the Makers, set up a petition on the UK Prime Minister's website to allow protest against what he alleges as \\"racial discrimination\\". In a statement on their web site, The British Academy of Composers and Songwriters CEO Patrick Rackow stated \\"...the imposition of Form 696 on live music is likely to discourage the existence and growth of live music. Music has long been a positive form of free expression, for people from all walks of life to create and enjoy. This form appears to single out certain genres of music and ethnic audiences and therefore the Academy cannot support it.‚Äù In December 2008, Mike Howlett, Chairman of the Music Producers Guild (UK), wrote to the General Secretary of the Musicians Union \\"In keeping with the Musicians Union and UK Music, we feel this is a gross infringement of civil liberties and a form of racial discrimination. We also feel that this will deter the staging of live musical events, stifle free expression and possibly penalise certain genres of music and ethnic audiences. Our members are horrified that this legislation, introduced in 2006, is being enforced under the guise of public law and order. We see no reason why artists and/or venue owners and managers should be forced to comply.\\" Police position David Isles, Detective Superintendent of the Metropolitan Police Clubs and Vice unit has stated that Form 696 is not designed to stop people having a good time. The Metropolitan Police web site describes the form as a Promotion Event risk assessment form. Detective Chief Superintendent Richard Martin stated that the original form, with its questions relating to audience ethnicity \\"was removed just because I don't think it added any value to the form.... We take account of where the event is playing, what other events might be playing nearby, the type of music that's being played, and whether there have been problems before. We've had quite a few of what I consider 'higher risk events', where there may be some problems - so we recommend additional searching processes and additional security to help manage the event safely.\\" \\"It's not about being risk averse, it's about managing the risk,\\" he said. \\"If you're a publican and you are just having some performers to entertain your regular customers, you won't be expected to do a risk assessment. It's for when the performance is being put on to draw people in. We will never assess somebody just on the genre of music they are performing. There is a whole raft of factors that are taken into account.\\" Form revised In September 2009, the Metropolitan Police announced \\"that venues would no longer be asked for details of the music style. A requirement to provide the telephone number of the performing artist will also be dropped and an independent \\"scrutiny panel\\" will be set up to ensure that the form is not misused.\\" Feargal Sharkey described this as an \\"exercise in semantics\\" and called for the form to be completely scrapped. He added that \\"it was clear that the altered version continued to target musicians from ethnic minorities and he objected strongly to a question which asks about the 'make-up of the patrons'.\\" Form 696 scrapped On 10 November 2017, it was announced that the use of Form 696 was to be discontinued in London following a review called for by Mayor of London Sadiq Khan. Reporting the decision, the BBC noted, \\"The Met denied the form had been used to target particular genres but said it had decided to drop it after a fall in 'serious incidents' at music events\\"; however, the BBC also reported that a Freedom of Information request earlier in 2017 had discovered that 16 other English police forces were using forms similar to Form 696.

After reconstruction work that lasted for two years, the fortress was open to visitors in July 2019. History Castel de S. Nicholo The town of ≈†ibenik has a fortification system consisting of four fortresses: * St. Nicholas Fortress (') * St. Michael's Fortress (') * St. John's Fortress (') * Barone Fortress () Only St. Nicholas Fortress is at sea, at the entrance to the ≈†ibenik port, and the remaining three are on land. St. Nicholas Fortress was built on the left side at the entrance to St. Anthony Channel, on the island called Ljuljevac. The island is situated at the entrance to the ≈†ibenik channel across the Jadrija beach lighthouse. St. Nicholas Fortress got its name from the Benedictine Monastery of St. Nicholas, which was originally on the island, but due to the construction of the fortress, it had to be demolished. At the request of domestic Croat population of ≈†ibenik, the Venetian captain Alvise Canal decided to build a fort on the island of Ljuljevac on 30 April 1525. The fortress was designed and built by the famous Venetian architect and builder Giangirolamo Sanmicheli (nephew of Michele Sanmicheli). It was built by in the 16th century to prevent Turkish boats from reaching the port. St. Nicholas Fortress was armed with 32 cannons. However, its imposing appearance and size were a bigger threat to the enemy than cannons ever were. Architecture St. Nicholas Fortress is at the entrance of the St. Anthony channel on this map from 16th century. The fortress is one of the most valuable and best preserved examples of defense architecture in Dalmatia. It is made of brick because that material was considered to be most resistant to cannonballs, while the foundations are made of stone. Although defense capabilities of the fortress have never been tested in military operations, the structure still proved successful in protecting the city from sea-bound enemy attacks. During the centuries of use, the structure served to various armies and has undergone a number of renovations, some of them necessary only because of the development of arms. It was completely abandoned by the military in 1979 and has been undergoing renovation ever since. Notes In the Mediterranean, there are two similar forts: one on the island of Malta, and the other is in Venice, named Forte di Sant'Andrea.

It is a fraternal agreement, freely endorsed, that establishes what are, according to the Holy Scriptures, the duties of a Christian and the responsibilities which each church member pledges himself or herself to honour.  History  The idea of a church covenant is an expression of the free-church ecclesiology and it issues from within the context of the English Puritanism, becoming afterwards one of the characteristic traits of the Baptist churches. In the 16th century, the Church in England, confronted with the teaching of the Bible under the impulse of continental Protestantism, engaged itself in a reformation which disconnected it from many persuasions, practices and traditions of Roman Catholicism. In particular, from the time of Henry VIII's divorce from Catherine of Aragon and subsequent marriage to Queen Anne Boleyn, it reflected on the meaning, structure and function of being a church and was involved in heated discussions on the measure according to which this reformation must occur. To the end of the reign of Edward VI the model of the Reformed Genevan ecclesiology prevailed. After the parenthesis of Mary I, in which Roman Catholicism was restored, with Elizabeth I a line of compromise prevailed and lasted until the time of Charles I when, caused by the English Civil War, Calvinist Presbyterianism was reintroduced. With Charles II, the Elizabethan settlement was reconfirmed and again imposed a compromise line between Catholicism and Protestantism. This Elizabethan compromise was opposed by many theologians and preachers who exerted considerable pressure so that, courageously, the church was finally purified from all Roman Catholic doctrines and practices unsupported by the Bible (from this the term Puritanism is mainly drawn). The resistance and refusal, nevertheless, of the institution to carry forward these reforms, considered by now unsupportable for the population, led some to force the situation and establish independent Christian congregations (from this the term Separatism is created) which, eventually will gave birth to the churches which are now known as Congregationalist and Baptist. A new ecclesiology thus matured in this context. It was different from the traditional one, the one used to the concept of territorial churches subdivided in parishes, \\"people's church\\", confused and allied with the state and governed by clerical hierarchies (episcopacy). It was \\"the free-church ecclesiology\\", in which the church is mainly a free and voluntary local association of committed Christians, democratically self-managed, distinct and independent from the State. They are Christians bound one to the others on the basis of a covenant and affirming a Confession of faith. In the case of the Baptist movement, believers' baptism is understood as the seal of such a commitment towards God and one to the other. This movement, consequently, gets closer and closer to the doctrines and experiences first of the Anabaptists, then of Mennonites. The concept of the church as God's people bound by a covenant, although not new in the history of Christianity, was developed extensively by the Strasbourg reformer Martin Bucer (1491‚Äì1551) and taken up in Puritanism by Richard Fitz (1570), who established in London by 1567 a Christian congregation separated from the officially sanctioned Anglican church. He expressed the aspiration, shared by many, to establish a church free from the State interference, characterised by what are understood by the signs of a true church: biblical preaching, New Testament sacraments, and ordered by a serious discipline. This church must be formed, Fitz wrote, on the basis of a voluntary covenant: Robert Browne (1540‚Äì1630) theorized how God's faithful people are called to separate themselves from the unfaithful ones, and that the only way to form a true church is, for believers, to agree together in a covenant, the signing of which is expected by all those who wish to be part of it. This way God's people would submit to the authority of Christ, becoming a real church. Signing this contract would become the sign of the genuine ChristianThe Theology of John Smyth: Puritan, Separatist, Baptist, Mennonite, di Jason K. Lee, published by Mercer University Press, 2003, p. 128). Henry Barrowe (1550‚Äì1593) took up and further elaborated on Browne's ideas, linking the local church covenant to the eternal covenant of God, emphasizing the consistent application of church discipline for those who infringe this covenant. In the Separatist Confession of Faith of 1596, article 33, the church is thus described: Records being rather scarce, we do not know how much the separatist ideas in fact do influence John Smyth's thought, main inspirer of the Baptist movement in England. Through great part of his career, Smyth believes that a local church covenant is the most appropriate answer to God's offer of the covenant of grace. He writes \\"to be debtor, in these ideas, to the separatist \\"ancient brothers\\".The Theology of John Smyth: Puritan, Separatist, Baptist, Mennonite, di Jason K. Lee, Mercer University Press, 2003, 136 Smyth declares that the true church members are \\"the saints only\\" and that these must convene in a local church through a fraternal covenant. From this perspectyive, Smyth has much in common with the Anabaptist persuasion that the best way to relate to God is through a community of believers. Later, as Smyth gets closer to the Mennonites, he does not any more emphasize this concept. The idea of church covenant becomes prominent among the puritans that settle in America. In 1648, in Cambridge (Massachusetts) John Cotton, Richard Mather, e Ralph Partridge draw out \\"a model for the government of the church\\" in which the reasoning thus follows: \\"this visible union cannot be established by mere 'faith,' for that is invisible; nor by a 'bare profession' of faith, for that does not make a person part of one particular church or another; nor by 'cohabitation' (i.e., living in the same community), for \\"atheists and Infidels may dwell together with believers\\"; nor by \\"baptism,\\" since baptism by itself does not make a person a part of a particular church. What establishes the visible union of a group of believers into a church is that they make a covenant with each other to be the church\\".  Relevance  As the pluralist and religion-neutral state asserts itself in our society, it causes more and more the loss of the traditional concept of \\"people's church\\" where one or more churches are acknowledged as \\"official churches\\" and they enjoy of the support of the State. All churches today are consequently \\"forced\\" to become, as a matter of fact, \\"free churches\\", namely free-will association of persons with common religious interests. Churches thus become not dissimilar from any other association organising itself after a common interest, with their own statutes and self-governed. The natural evolution of our society is leading to a new reappraisal of the concept of church covenant, the document which establishes the rights and duties of those who are members of the church. We see, thus, a process of de- institutionalisation of all the churches, which may issue in a real \\"purification\\" from the evils and corruption which originally were the consequence of the act by which the Roman Emperor Constantine making Christianity \\" the religion of the state\\". Signing of a church covenant indeed makes the church member more serious, committed and responsible concerning duties which, although established in the New Testament, can easily be neglected or delegated to others.

Informally, this means that the chance of finding a zero in a very short interval of length 2œÄL/log(T) at a distance 2œÄu/log(T) from a zero 1/2+iT is about L times the expression above. (The factor 2œÄ/log(T) is a normalization factor that can be thought of informally as the average spacing between zeros with imaginary part about T.) showed that the conjecture was supported by large-scale computer calculations of the zeros. The conjecture has been extended to correlations of more than 2 zeros, and also to zeta functions of automorphic representations . In 1982 a student of Montgomery's, Ali Erhan √ñzl√ºk, proved the pair correlation conjecture for some of Dirichlet's L-functions. The connection with random unitary matrices could lead to a proof of the Riemann hypothesis. The Hilbert‚ÄìP√≥lya conjecture asserts that the zeros of the Riemann Zeta function correspond to the eigenvalues of a linear operator, and implies RH. Some people think this is a promising approach (). Montgomery was studying the Fourier transform F(x) of the pair correlation function, and showed (assuming the Riemann hypothesis) that it was equal to x for x<1\\\\. His methods were unable to determine it for x‚â•1, but he conjectured that it was equal to 1 for these x, which implies that the pair correlation function is as above. He was also motivated by the notion that the Riemann hypothesis is not a brick wall, and one should feel free to make stronger conjectures.  Numerical calculation by Odlyzko  The real line describes the two-point correlation function of the random matrix of type GUE. Blue dots describe the normalized spacings of the non trivial zeros of Riemann zeta function, the first 105 zeros. In the 1980s, motivated by the Montgomery's conjecture, Odlyzko began an intensive numerical study of the statistics of the zeros of Œ∂(s). He confirmed that the distribution of the spacings between non-trivial zeros using detail numerical calculation and demonstrated that the Montgomery's conjecture would be true and the distribution would agree with the distribution of spacings of GUE random matrix eigenvalues using Cray X-MP. In 1987 he reported the calculations in the paper . For non trivial zero, 1/2+iŒ≥n, let the normalized spacings be : \\\\delta_n = \\\\frac{\\\\gamma_{n+1}-\\\\gamma_{n}}{2 \\\\pi} { \\\\log{ \\\\frac{\\\\gamma_n}{2 \\\\pi} }} . Then we would expect the following formula as the limit for M, N \\\\to\\\\infty: :\\\\frac{1}{M} \\\\\\\\{(n,k)  N \\\\leq n \\\\leq N+M, \\\\,k \\\\geq 0, \\\\,\\\\delta_{n}+ \\\\delta_{n+1}+ \\\\cdots +\\\\delta_{n+k} \\\\in [ \\\\alpha, \\\\beta] \\\\\\\\} \\\\sim \\\\int_{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\beta} \\\\left ( 1- \\\\biggl ( \\\\frac{\\\\sin{\\\\pi u}}{\\\\pi u} \\\\biggr )^2 \\\\right ) du Based on a new algorithm developed by Odlyzko and Sch√∂nhage that allowed them to compute a value of Œ∂(1/2 + it) in an average time of tŒµ steps, Odlyzko computed millions of zeros at heights around 1020 and gave some evidence for the GUE conjecture.A.

The porch, which was ornately decorated with turned posts and balusters, has been replaced by one with a simple hip roof with square posts for support. A porch with similar but less ornate styling and a shed roof used to shelter the back entrance to the building. The house was built about 1894, when Worcester's Belmont Hill area was rapidly growing with an influx of Scandinavian immigrants. Residents here were typically employed at the North Works of the Washburn and Moen Company.

Built about 1856 but probably not completed until 1861, it is a prominent early example of Second Empire architecture, and one of a small number of stone villas to survive (out of a larger number built) in the neighborhood. Lucius Pond, its second owner, was an important local machinist. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history The Borden-Pond House stands in a residential area overlooking Interstate 290 on Worcester's east side, at the northwest corner of Laurel and Edward Streets. It is a three-story stone structure, set on a stone foundation partially exposed by the steeply sloping lot. The lower two stories of the main block are stone, with a cornice and roof skirt separating them from the third floor, which is framed in wood and finished in clapboards. The house originally had a mansard roof. A two-story ell extends to the rear; it is stone on the first floor and wood-frame on the second, with a gabled roof. The house is a rare survivor from a period when a number of stone villas were built in this area; most of them have been demolished. Construction on the house began c.1856‚Äì59, probably by John Borden, a mason and its first resident. According to local lore, Borden could not afford to finisht the building, and sold it to Lucius Pond in 1861. Pond was a leading local industrialist, who helped invent the Ellsworth repeating rifle. Pond was director of a local bank when rumors of its insolvency led to his flight in 1875. He was arrested in San Francisco, California, attempting to gain passage on a ship to Australia. Pond was convicted of forging bank notes, and spent seven years in prison.

Under the original constitution of the University, the post of Warden combined the roles of chief executive and formal head of the University. Charles Thorp was appointed acting warden in December 1831 by Bishop William van Mildert, and in 1834 he was appointed to the position on a permanent basis by the Dean and Chapter of Durham Cathedral (who were then the governors of the University). After Thorp's death in 1862, the post of Warden was held ex officio by the Dean of Durham, with Sub-Warden (which had previously been rotated between the professors of the University) becoming a permanent post, presaging the vice- chancellorship. From 1909, with the creation of the federal university, and the handing over of the dean and chapter's responsibilities to the newly- formed council, the executive and formal roles were officially separated into the vice-chancellor (executive head) and the chancellor (formal head), with the warden becoming the chancellor and the sub-warden becoming the vice- chancellor. The vice-chancellor was elected by the council to serve a two-year term. In 1937 the permanent posts of Warden of the Durham Colleges and Rector of King's College were created, with the vice-chancellorship being held by each for two years at a time. With King's College becoming Newcastle University in 1963, the wardenship of the Durham Colleges was permanently united with the vice-chancellorship as the vice-chancellor and warden. The University numbers Chris Higgins as its 23rd vice-chancellor and warden, implying a count starting with the University's reconstitution in 1909 and continuing through the further reconstitutions in 1937 and 1963 despite the changes of title over this period.

A census revealed the following drawing types and abundances: Animals: * Eight antelopes, the nicest measure 1.50 m of long; very close to its back are engraved a spear and two throwing knives; two others are of lesser quality. * Feline, two with round heads and raised long tail. * Five very stylized and badly preserved animals, impossible to identify. * Two birds of good size, perhaps bustards in mating positions. Human playing bit parts: A figure having moved aside legs, massive and short trunk on which arms are pointed out by two traits; it has a very small head of bird which, according to information acquired on place would be a ritual mask. The outlines of this silhouette are given by a polished, broad but rather shallow trait. Weapon and various objects: The presentations of weapons are the most numerous: * Sixteen spears with very long shafts. * An arrow with a short shaft. * Four twenty-one throwing knives where they can identify thirty different types. Some people are very simple, right and bent back, others contrariwise in the numerous branches show an ornamental or ritual research and carry curls, hooks and notches. They are for the majority more complex. * A calabash provided with a rope forming a curl. The inside of the drawings is finely staked out, the well marked neck and outlines were carried out by a carefully polished trait. This domestic object serves even in the region of Bakouma for the transport and the conservation of water at present in small quantity.

Built circa 1928, it is an uncommon survivor of the late period of triple decker construction, and is also rare as a \\"double\\" triple decker with six units. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description and history The Henry Bousquet Three-Decker stands in Worcester's eastern Franklin Plantation neighborhood, on the west side of Fairmont Avenue near its junction with Plantation Street. It is a three-story wood frame structure, with a hip roof and an artificially sided exterior. The main facade is five bays wide, with symmetrically arranged picture and sash windows on either side of a three- story stack of porches. Despite the recent application of siding, some of the building's Colonial Revival features have been retained. These features include the triangular vent in the gable over the porches, and the arched porch openings. The building was built about 1928, a relatively late date for the construction of triple deckers. It is an unusual example of the form in the city, for its six-unit configuration, and for its Colonial Revival features. It was probably built by Henry Bousquet, a carpenter who was its first documented owner. Early tenants of the building were mainly working class laborers, who took streetcars (and later automobiles) to reach jobs in the city's industrial facilities. The neighborhood in which it stands was mostly developed in the 1910s and early 1920s.

It is sometimes called the Werther Quartet after Goethe's The Sorrows of Young Werther. Structure The quartet is in four movements: Analysis First movement The first movement is a sonata-form movement in C minor in triple meter. It begins with the piano playing bare octaves on C. The violin, viola, and violoncello then play the first theme, consisting of two sighing gestures of a descending minor second, followed by a descending theme. Some have speculated that the sighing motive is a musical utterance of the name \\"Clara\\", in reference to Clara Schumann, the composer, pianist, and lifelong friend and love interest of Brahms. More clear is Brahms's transposed version of Robert Schumann's \\"Clara theme\\", found in various pieces such as his Bunte Bl√§tter, Op. 99 (1841), on which both Clara and Brahms wrote sets of piano variations. The Clara theme (C‚ÄìB‚ÄìA‚ÄìG‚ÄìA, often transposed: here E‚ÄìD‚ÄìC‚ÄìB‚ÄìC) was first detected by Eric Sams in his essays and books on Schumann and Brahms. In his 1971 essay ‚ÄúBrahms and his Clara Themes‚Äù, Sams writes on the ‚ÄúClara content‚Äù in op. 60: ‚ÄúThe first sentence of that autobiographical work is doubly expressive of Clara. Furthermore, there is direct evidence that this melodic form actually embodied her, for Brahms as for Schumann.‚Äù After the first statement of the theme, the piano plays octaves on B. The opening motives, again played by the strings, becomes more chromatic and unsettling, until finally coming to rest on the dominant of C, G major. The viola and violin play pizzicato octaves on E before the strings cascade down the C harmonic minor scale that ushers in the first theme, stated forte. After a brief development of this theme, an ascending gesture based on sixteenth-notes alternating between the notes of a minor second serves as the transition to the second theme in the relative major of C minor, E major. This second theme is an uplifting eight-measure theme stated initially in the piano alone. Brahms then uses the technique of theme and variations to construct four variations on this theme, each eight measures long. A short idea based on the opening theme closes the exposition, which is not repeated. The development section begins by restating the theme from measures 32‚Äì35 in E minor. This moves to B major for a new fortissimo idea (perhaps a variation) based on the same theme. The quartet's opening sighing motives become developed in an E minor passage that incorporates a triplet figure on the second beat of the measure, and eventually the previous B major idea is restated identically in G major. The second theme from the exposition is then treated in imitative (almost canonic) counterpoint in C minor. After the beginning of the third contrapuntal treatment of this theme, a dominant pedal is sustained in octaves on G. This resolves unexpectedly to an A major chord that is quickly brought down to C minor by the opening sighing motive in the piano. The sighing motive indicates the beginning of the recapitulation. Rather than affirming the tonic of C minor, however, Brahms takes the recapitulation in a different direction: the opening section again ends on a dominant pedal on G with the violin and viola playing pizzicato octaves on E, but the E is used to turn the music to E minor. Chromatic descent is employed to bring the music to a half-cadence on D, leading to the second theme in G major. This is perhaps the only sonata form movement in the minor mode in which the recapitulation features the second subject in the key of the major dominant. The second theme is first stated by the viola, which is then followed by three new variations (the first being played by the violin, the second and third by the piano), and one of the same variations as the exposition. A fifth variation leads to a short digression in C major but becomes chromatic and ends with a development the first theme, coming to a cadence on C. This is followed by a brief coda that expands on the first motives heard in the piece. Nevertheless, the key of C minor is arguably not clearly established by the recapitulation (the key signature of C minor is present at the end of the movement for less than two complete pages). The movement ends with a clear tonic‚Äìdominant‚Äìtonic perfect cadence, stated piano. The expansive and exploratory nature of the movement, along with the quiet closing dynamic, helps make the conventional final cadential progression appear mysterious. Second movement The second movement is a tempestuous scherzo (ternary form) in compound duple meter in C minor, the same key as the first movement. Donald Francis Tovey argues that Brahms puts the scherzo in the same key as the first movement because the first movement does not sufficiently stabilize its own tonic and requires the second movement to \\"[furnish] the tonal balance unprovided for by the end of the first movement.\\" Although it is the shortest scherzo of Brahms's piano quartets, it is formally and tonally very complex. The movement begins with an opening motif of a descending octave on G and a rising minor second to A stated by the piano, followed by a falling diatonic line accompanied by the strings. The first theme, which clearly derives from the opening motif, is immediately by the solo piano played after this and Brahms uses the technique of developing variation to expand this theme. Most melodic ideas can be traced to the opening motif or the ascending minor second of the opening motif, which, notably, is the inversion of the descending sighs of the introduction of the first movement. This scherzo is very chromatic and unstable tonally, although it does actually move to a secondary phrase on the dominant and returns to the tonic with frequency. The scherzo ends with a pedal on the tonic C minor. The middle section is not demarcated by the title of trio as are the middle sections of the scherzi from Brahms's previous two piano quartets. Moreover, this middle section serves more as a section of contrasting material than as a structural contrast‚Äîit maintains the same key signature, time signature, and tempo as the scherzo, is not musically marked off in any clear way, and even develops the same themes as the scherzo. One may argue whether it is in fact a trio at all, as nineteenth century composers knew it. Nonetheless, the middle section begins with a new theme, an ascending line in quarter notes in the strings, accompanied by a descending triplet figure played by the piano. This instrumentation is soon reversed and earlier themes from the scherzo become further developed. The transition back to the scherzo develops and rhythmically diminishes the opening motif of the scherzo and is the most chromatic, rhythmically complex, loud, and dramatic section of the movement. The scherzo is repeated almost entirely, however, the section immediately preceding the tonic pedal is omitted and replaced with a climactic dominant chord in a very high register in the strings, ending with a tierce de picardie on C major with three loud declamations of the tonic major chord. Third movement The Andante is in a modified ternary form: ABCA‚Ä≤ with a coda. This is the only movement of the quartet that is not in C minor, and it is in the key of E major, a remote key in the context of C minor. This can be explained by its origin as the slow movement to a piano quartet in C-sharp minor, which Brahms revised and published as Op. 60 in C minor. The key of E major is easily explained in the tonal context of C minor, but the key choice of this movement was not revised as was the first movement; it should also be noted that the slow movement to Brahms's Symphony No. 1 in C minor is also in E major. The Andante begins with a luscious melody played by the violoncello in its upper register (Theme A) with only the piano as accompaniment. The opening thematic material of this melody is a sequence of descending thirds, a gesture frequently used by Brahms (such as in his Op. 119, No. 1, and the opening to Symphony No. 4, to name two examples). The violin eventually joins in with a new melody over the cello. The viola enters later with a tutti descending stepwise idea. The A section, which is itself in a sort of AAB form, ends in the conventional dominant key of B major. The B section (in ABAB form) begins with a syncopated ascending stepwise melodic line in the violin to be played molto dolce (Theme B). The piano begins to gain prominence with a distorted version of the opening cello line, played symmetrically across the piano (Theme C). Another theme developed in the B section is a falling line with dotted rhythms (Theme D). The third section begins in B major but is highly chromatic. The piano plays a version of Theme B in broken octaves under consistent eighth-notes played by the violin and viola. This figure ends with a version of Theme C in broken octaves in the piano. This alternates with the string section, which develops Theme C. The piano rejoins and develops Themes C and D with the strings in E minor, but soon the violin plays Theme D over the other strings. At this point, the strings alternate with the piano, which plays Theme D in an unstable harmonic palette in broken octaves, while the strings play a combination of Themes C and D. This passage of alternating instruments moves from E minor to C minor to G minor back to E major in the reprise of the A section. The only significant differences between the first and second A sections are that in the second, the piano moves in triplets, there is a full string texture almost entirely throughout (often using pizzicato), and the piano begins the theme (although it is soon replaced by the cello). The coda is introduced by a new chord progression in the first tutti idea and by a solo cello line. Theme B is presented first by the viola and then by the violin, and the movement ends with the first measure of Theme A, stated first by the cello and then by the piano, concluding with a pianissimo affirmation of the tonic. Fourth movement The finale is a sonata-allegro in C minor in cut time with a secondary subject in E major. The tempo is Allegro comodo and the exposition is repeated. The piano accompaniment for the first theme, stated immediately in measure 1, is taken from the opening piano line of Felix Mendelssohn's Piano Trio in C minor, Op. 66, movement 1. Mendelssohn's Piano Trio also features a quotation of a chorale melody taken from the sixteenth-century Genevan psalter 'Vor deinen Thron tret ich hiermit' (‚ÄúBefore Your Throne I Now Appear‚Äù). Vincent C. K. Cheung has also observed that the opening G‚ÄìE motion in the violin, coupled with the G‚ÄìG‚ÄìG‚ÄìC in the piano greatly points toward the ‚ÄúFate theme‚Äù in Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. Brahms's piece thus operates on multiple levels of reference (both literary and musical) and quotation. The movement begins with the violin playing a theme above piano accompaniment. Both lines are separate themes that are developed individually throughout the movement, but they are similar in one major respect: both are constructed of three ascending notes preceded by a pickup, which go to a neighbor tone of the highest note and move back to that note. The essential notes of the violin theme are B‚ÄìC‚ÄìD‚ÄìE‚ÄìF‚ÄìE, and the essential notes of the piano theme are: G‚ÄìC‚ÄìE‚ÄìG‚ÄìF‚ÄìG (the rest of the piano theme is a descending sequence of ascending seconds: G‚ÄìA‚ÄìF‚ÄìG‚ÄìE‚ÄìF‚ÄìD‚ÄìE). Therefore, the violin line uses an upper neighbor tone while the piano line uses a lower neighbor tone. This is crucial for understanding Brahms's development of the thematic ideas of this movement. The violin melody is halting and primarily diatonic, played over an energetic piano accompaniment. It moves from C minor to G minor, although it ends with a change of mode to G major. After this, the violin plays a descending stepwise melody, which under close inspection is revealed to be an inversion of its own original theme (from B‚ÄìC‚ÄìD‚ÄìE‚ÄìF‚ÄìE to G‚ÄìF‚ÄìE‚ÄìD‚ÄìC‚ÄìB) in successive quarter notes. The viola and cello soon accompany this figure. This builds up until measure 39, where a thunderous theme erupts in all instruments. This moves quickly to an idea constructed in triplets. Tonally, this passage is in C minor, and the final progression ends with an alternation between B-diminished and A major. The piano plays a broken A major chord, followed by a broken A minor chord that is used to make a transition to E major. The section in the relative major begins with a theme clearly composed from the theme of the piano's accompaniment, in this case stated by the violin and viola moving in unison over a piano accompaniment based on the previous broken chordal figure. This briefly exchanges with a cello countermelody. When the violin and viola soar to an unexpectedly high register, the piano interrupts by playing an explosive broken dominant seventh chord. The strings respond by a piano, homophonic, homorythmic theme to be played mezza voce (medium voice). This idea is taken directly from the opening string theme of the first movement. Rather than accompanying this theme, the piano plays a descending broken chord after each utterance. The exposition ends in E-flat major, and Brahms indicates that it should be repeated. The development begins with an exploration of the descending third that begins the violin's opening theme; when sequenced, this produces a series of descending thirds that recalls the opening theme of the third movement (G‚ÄìE‚ÄìC‚ÄìA). The piano accompanies this with its initial theme. Brahms quickly eliminates accidentals from the key signature as the piece progresses to D major and A minor. Interspersed are descending chromatic phrases played by the piano. In measures 117‚Äì118, the cello introduces a new four-note idea (E‚ÄìF‚ÄìD‚ÄìE) played pizzicato underneath the piano. This idea is taken from the second half of the first piano theme (G‚ÄìA‚ÄìF‚ÄìG). The viola plays the opening of the piano's first theme, which resembles an inversion of the sequenced thirds developed moments earlier. Brahms repeats this pattern almost exactly, moving from A minor to E minor to B minor. In B minor, the piano develops its initial theme to a greater extent. This part of the development section is concluded by syncopated phrases by the viola and piano, which echo the second half of the piano's first theme in B minor. Karl Geiringer has shown that the next section (measures 155‚Äì188) is an insertion \\"in order to mitigate the excessive conciseness of this movement.\\" Later insertions were atypical of Brahms because of his \\"striving after compression,\\" and it seems that he \\"for once overshot the mark.\\" The later addition explains the motion away from B minor, only to return to the key some thirty measures later. This section continues with the homorhythmic theme in G major, then in E major. What follows is a quick (Tempo I) development of the initial piano theme in C minor, with all strings playing the opening four notes (moving in the often used progression i ‚Äì I ‚Äì iv). This exact sequence is used again in the coda to turn the movement from the minor mode to major. A dominant seventh chord in C minor is used as a pivot chord to return to B minor (a similar progression is used in Brahms's Ballade, Op. 118, No. 3, in which a dominant seventh chord built on G moves abruptly to B major). The violin develops its initial theme in B minor and then D minor with all three string instruments. The final notes of the theme (F‚ÄìE) are sequenced and inverted repeatedly, recalling the significance of descending seconds in the first movement of this quartet. This moves from D minor to G minor to C minor. The end of the development section sees a very high and prolonged A, which parallels the end of the development section of the first movement. The recapitulation, which reinstates the key signature of C minor, begins with the initial violin theme stated forte by all strings, accompanied by the piano playing broken octaves in triplets, outlining the main notes of its theme. After the first statement, the piano resumes its original accompaniment and the strings are reduced to a piano dynamic. This proceeds similarly to the exposition, albeit with the themes developed more extensively. Notably, the music turns toward G minor more strongly and the key signature changes to C major, as the relative major section from the exposition is in the tonic major in the recapitulation. The rest of the recapitulation is nearly identical to the exposition, ending in C major. The coda begins at measure 311, with the piano loudly declaring the homorhythmic theme, alternating with the strings. The violin theme is then played by the strings in C major, but it soon shifts back to C minor (the key signature too returns). The four-note idea from the development section comes back, this time with its first note removed. The chromatic descending scale in the piano, an abbreviation of the violin theme in the viola, the four-note theme, and the chord progression (i ‚Äì I ‚Äì iv) indicate that the coda draws more from the development section than from the exposition or recapitulation. The music quietly subsides into a tranquillo section in which the inversion of the violin theme (first stated in measures 21‚Äì22 from the exposition) is sequenced across the strings while the piano continues to develop its initial theme. The violin and cello eventually sustain the tonic C for a great amount of time while the piano and viola begin to lean toward the tonic major in a continuing I ‚Äì iv progression. All instruments continue to die down as the piano plays one last descending chromatic scale, the violin and viola combine the piano's initial theme with the quarter note rhythm of the violin theme, and the cello sustains a low C. As the piano and strings reach their final notes, a C major chord stated pianissimo is held briefly, shining out of the mist. Two sudden forte C major chords complete this quartet.

It was premiered in 1861 in Hamburg, with Clara Schumann at the piano. It was also played in Vienna on 16 November 1862, with Brahms himself at the piano supported by members of the Hellmesberger Quartet.Melvin Berger, Guide to Chamber Music, 2001, Dover. p. 90‚Äì91, Like most piano quartets, it is scored for piano, violin, viola and cello.  Structure  The quartet is in four movements:  Analysis  First movement This first movement, a sonata form movement in G minor and common time, begins immediately with the first theme, a declamatory statement in straight quarter-notes, stated in octaves for the piano alone. This theme is the opening cell that governs the content of the rest of the musical material in the movement. The other instruments soon join in to develop this initial theme and cadence in G minor. There are four other themes in the exposition. The second is in B major (for all instruments), the third is in D minor (beginning with solo cello), and the fourth and fifth are in D major (the fourth being the D minor theme in the major mode and developed differently as well, and the fifth being a more exuberant idea for all instruments, marked 'animato'). The exposition ends with a closing section that develops only the opening theme and oscillates between D major and D minor, and eventually ends, almost reluctantly, in D major. Although the exposition is not repeated, Brahms creates the illusion of its repetition by starting the development section with the identical ten measures that begins the exposition, up to and including the strong G minor cadence. The development section then goes through many of the themes previously heard and extends them in new ways, and moves from A minor to E minor and eventually to D major. Very atypically, the recapitulation begins not with the first theme, but with the second theme in G major. The resolution is short-lived, as it moves back to the minor mode, where it cadences after an imitative development of the first theme in G minor. The recapitulation ends with a coda that is relatively brief but intense, concluding with an ascending passage built through imitation of the opening cell, whose buildup comes suddenly crashing down in a descending 'fortissimo' phrase. The piece ends on a desolate and incomplete-sounding G minor chord, the highest notes being the third and fifth scale degrees of the tonic triad rather than the tonic. Second movement The second movement, marked Intermezzo and Trio, is in C minor and compound triple meter. It is in ternary form and functions like a scherzo, the more traditional second or third movement of a piano quartet. The consistently repeated eighth notes creates an effect of perpetual motion, even agitation, although the melodic themes are quite lyrical. The intermezzo flirts between major and minor and ends in C major. The trio, in A major, is quicker and less agitated than the intermezzo; the trio has two primary themes, the first being in A and the second beginning in E major. The intermezzo is repeated, followed by a brief coda in C major that restates the theme of the trio. Third movement The Andante slow movement, is a ternary form movement in E major in triple time. The first subject is very lyrical. A second idea, which brings back the repeated eighth notes from the intermezzo, begins the transition to the second main section. The second section is in C major and starts with fortissimo chords in dotted rhythm for the piano solo. The second theme itself is rhythmically energetic and exuberant in character. It is initially stated by the piano and accompanied by light sixteenth note gestures by the strings, although this is later reversed. After a surprising twist, in which the instruments land on a diminished-seventh chord, the first theme returns, first in C major and then in the home key of E major. A long coda helps to stabilize the often dissonant and unstable harmonies of the movement. Like the previous movements, this movement develops a plethora of themes. The final cadence of this movement, from the minor subdominant to the tonic, is used to conclude many of Brahms's slow movements, such as that from the Piano Quintet. The voicing of the last chord is ominous: the highest note of the strings is the violin's open G string, while the piano plays a tonic chord (again with the third on top) two octaves higher. Fourth movement This fast rondo (marked 'presto') is in G minor in duple time. The subtitle \\"Rondo alla zingarese\\" has given it the nickname \\"Gypsy Rondo.\\" Like many of Brahms's finales, this uses as its principal theme a very fast, rhythmic, tonal, simple idea (see the finales to his Piano Quintet and Double Concerto), this one covering an irregular number of measures. The formal design resembles: ABACDBCADCBA, although the movement is more nuanced than this because each section is in ABA form and cadenzas occasionally interject between sections. This movement is notable for its difficulty, rhythmic and metrical complexity, and harmonic exploration (for instance, after the final D section, the piano plays a cadenza based on the B section that modulates from G minor to F minor), and has remained one of the most difficult movements to perform in all of Brahms's chamber music. Arrangements The quartet was orchestrated by Arnold Schoenberg in 1937, at the instigation of conductor Otto Klemperer and premiered by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Klemperer; this orchestrated version was made into the ballet Brahms‚ÄìSchoenberg Quartet by George Balanchine. The Hungarian-born composer Ernst von Dohn√°nyi transcribed the fourth movement as a bravura showpiece for solo piano. There is a recording of Dohn√°nyi playing the transcription on the Ampico B recording piano. This recording was released on a Newport Classic CD called \\"The Performing Piano II\\" (NC 60030), but the piece is incorrectly attributed as being one of the Hungarian Dances.

Retrieved on 2009-02-20. The agency reported that the ship had earlier been chased by two Russian coast guard vessels, but refused to stop despite being fired upon. Chinese J-Rui(ÂêâÁëûÁ••) claims According to a written statement by the Hong Kong based J-Rui Lucky Shipping company(ÂêâÁëûÁ••): According to J-Rui the New Star delivered 4,978 tons of rice from Thailand to the Russian port of Nakhodka on January 29, 2009. But the Russian buyer refused to accept the rice because of quality concerns, suspended the unloading, and asked for damages of US$330,000. The New Star was detained at the port for several days, but on February 11 the unloading process restarted and was completed later the same day. The Russian agent did not cooperate in helping the New Star complete departure procedures. After a number of unsuccessful attempts to obtain customs clearance, the Tongyu Shipping Company instructed the captain to set sail on the evening of February 12. On February 13 according to the J-Rui account, the Russian authorities sent coastal guard vessels to pursue the New Star, on the grounds that it had not received permission to leave port. A survivor account describes how a Russian warship fired on the cargo ship for several hours using artillery and heavy machine guns, severely damaging its hull. The Russian patrol then ordered the New Star back to Nakhodka despite the damages. At 3:06 AM on February 15, 2009 the ship sank. Result The warship fired 500 rounds at the cargo vessel, sinking it in Russian waters near the eastern port city of Vladivostok.

He was one of the original founders of the Democratic Party of Guam. He served for six terms in the Guam Legislature.  Early life  Flores, a lancheru as ranchers are known in Guam, began grazing approximately eight hundred head of cattle and carabao on several acres on his ranch in Inarajan early in his life. He also founded Flores Poultry Farm, which would later grow to include more than 75,000 chickens at a time. Flores also cultivated vegetables and fruit on his farm.  World War II  Flores was just 25 years old at the time of the Japanese invasion of Guam in 1941 during World War II. He began to cultivate rice, all of which was used to feed the Japanese troops during the occupation. His livestock was also confiscated at times during the war in order to feed Japanese forces on the island. During the war, Flores provided assistance to Father Jesus Baza Duenas, a Chamorro Roman Catholic priest and an outspoken critic of the Japanese. Duena would later be captured and executed by the Japanese military. Flores' wife, Ester Duenas Flores, was seven months pregnant with the couple's first child when Guam was liberated by the Americans in 1944.  Politics  Flores held many local political offices throughout his long career on Guam. He originally served as an Inarajan commissioner, as well as an Inarajan assemblyman. He also held posts on various boards and committees. Flores served six terms as a senator beginning in the fourth Guam Legislature. His often fiery, often passionate speeches earned him the nickname of \\"Davy Crockett\\" in Guamanian politics. Flores always ended his campaign speeches with the Chamorro language slogan, \\"Bai hu puno' i toro,\\" which translates to \\"I will kill the bull\\" in English, an allusion to his early life as a lancheru.  Death  Alfred Flores died in his sleep at his home in Malojloj, Guam, on February 6, 2009 at the age of 92. He was survived by his wife of 69 years, Ester Duenas Flores. The couple would have celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary on February 18, 2009. Flores was also survived by his three children - Lucille, May and Fred - ten grandchildren, and thirteen great-grandchildren. His viewing and funeral mass were held at the Saint Joseph Church in Inarajan. He was intermediate at Our Lady of Peace Memorial Gardens in Windward Hills, Yona.

The probabilistic voting model assumes that voters are imperfectly informed about candidates and their platforms. Candidates are also imperfectly informed about the utility preferences of the electorate and the distribution of voters' preferences. Unlike the median voter theorem, what drives the equilibrium policy is both the numerosity and the density of social groups and not the median position of voters on a preference scale. This difference explains why social groups which have a great homogeneity of preferences are more politically powerful than those whose preferences are dispersed. Motivation and Applications Political economy and public economics are the main fields where the probabilistic voting theory is applied. In particular, it was used to explain public expenditure (Persson & Tabellini, 2000; Hassler, Krusell, Storesletten & Zilibotti, 2005), public debt dynamics (Song, Storesletten & Zilibotti, 2012), effect of mass media (Str√∂mberg, 2004) social security systems (Profeta, 2002; Gonzalez Eiras & Niepelt, 2008) and taxation (Hettich & Winer, 2005; Canegrati, 2007). Raphael Boleslavsky and Christopher Cotton (2015) show how the underlying uncertainty that candidates have about the preferences of voters may be the result of information revelation during campaigns, with more informative campaigns leading to greater ex ante uncertainty about election- day preferences. This in turn can increase policy divergence. Probabilistic voting models are usually preferred to traditional Downsian median voter models, as in the former all voters have an influence on the policy outcome, whereas in the latter all power rests in the hands of the pivotal voter or group. For instance, in models where young and old (or rich and poor) voters have conflicting interests, probabilistic voting models predict that the winning candidate strikes a balance between the different interests in her/his policy platform. Due to the smooth mapping between the distribution of policy preferences and the political outcomes, this model has proven to be very tractable and convenient to use in dynamic models with repeated voting.

Description and history The Brightside is located on the east side of King Street, a residential street, just north of Main Street (Massachusetts Route 9) on Worcester's south side. It is a four-story structure, built out of red brick with sandstone trim. It features symmetrical round bays flanking a center entrance, which is recessed behind a pair of fluted sandstone columns that are topped by a balcony that still sports original wrought iron railings. Between the upper floors are decorative sandstone panels, and there is a course of rockfaced sandstone between the fourth floor windows and the roof, where the projecting window bays are topped by (again, original) railings. A similar sandstone beltcourse extends across the projecting bays between the first and second floors, and some of the window bays are topped by similarly styled lintels. The block is one of the more expensive of a series of apartment houses built in the Main South area of Worcester in the 1880s, and the most ornate to survive. The four story brick and sandstone apartment house was built in 1888 at a cost of $40,000, and was probably built to a specific plan by Fuller & Delano, unlike other buildings which were built from standard plans.

He later became one of the most distinguished and sympathetic sports officials of his generation, as the long-serving general secretary of the British Olympic Association. For many years he was synonymous with the Olympic movement in Britain. Duncan was educated at Malvern College, where his ability at the long jump was quickly evident ‚Äî he won the London Athletic Club‚Äôs schools championships with a record leap of 22 ft 5in. His prowess earned him a Blue in his first year at Oxford University, and he also won the 100 yards against Cambridge, as well as getting a football Blue. In the AAA championships he came in the top six in the long jump every year from 1932 to 1937, finishing second in 1934. He represented Britain in 1935 and, in July 1936, ran his fastest time of 9.8 seconds for the 100 yards, although a hamstring injury prevented him from being selected for the Olympics. In 1938, he was sixth in both the shot and discus. At the 1934 Empire Games he finished fourth in the long jump event. At the 1938 British Empire Games, he was a member of the English relay team which won the silver medal in the 4√ó110 yards competition. In the long jump contest he finished tenth and in the 100 yards event he was eliminated in the heats. In indoor games, he won the British 70 metres dash in 1938. During the war he served in the Royal Artillery and rose to the rank of Major. After the war Duncan taught at Bradfield and, having qualified as an AAA coach. His administrative career began in 1947 when he was made secretary of the Universities‚Äô Athletic Union. This gave him the initial experience for his appointment, two years later, as general secretary at the British Olympic Association (BOA), the organisation responsible for the United Kingdom's participation in the Olympic Games. He held this post for 26 years, from 1949 to 1975 and served as chef de mission at 12 Olympics, summer and winter, from the 1952 Oslo and Helsinki games to Montreal in 1976. He was also honorary secretary of the Commonwealth Games Federation, supervising celebrations from Vancouver 1954 to Brisbane in 1982. He also served as secretary of the Achilles Club, for Oxford and Cambridge Blues, for 39 years. Although appointed OBE, he was probably better recognised outside Britain than in his own country. In 1952, he was given the White Rose and Lion from Finland and the rare Olympic Award from the IOC in 1984.

Built between 1847 and 1856 by John Brooks, a prominent local farmer and politician, it is one of a small number of 19th-century farmhouses still standing in the city. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, at which time it was still the hands of Brooks' descendants. Description and history The John Brooks House is located in a basically residential area in northern Worcester, on a large lot at the northwest corner of Nelson Place and Grove Street (Massachusetts Route 122A). It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a roughly T-shaped plan covered by gabled roofs. The south facade distinctively has three large gables which rise to nearly meet the main ridge line, with rake edges adorned by paired Italianate brackets. A single-story hip-roofed enclosed porch extends across part of this facade, with an entrance at the far right sheltered by an ornately carved hood. Facing Nelson Place, the gable end of the main block is also adorned with brackets. A less elaborate ell with a lower pitch roof extends to the west. John Brooks, a Princeton native and farmer, purchased land here in 1847, and is believed to have built the ell of the house by 1851. The main block was added later, by 1856. In addition to farming, Brooks served on Worcester's common council, and in the state legislature. He was also active in the development of the city's Chadwick Square and Greendale areas.

It was converted to the MSX and ZX Spectrum by Simon Freeman. Usage Psychedelia allowed a user to generate a light show on the screen grid, using the joystick to send pulses or bursts of coloured squares. There are various preset settings, or the user can manually set the variables controlling the pulses. Patterns can be recorded to memory or tape for later playback. Unlike Minter's later synthesizers such as Neon, Psychedelia does not use audio as a factor, only using a joystick's input. It is, however, intended to be played in accompaniment to music. History Minter had been considering \\"dynamic interactive pattern generators\\" but hadn't coded any previously. An idea for an algorithm came to him, in which patterns would be seeded along a path, which would then expand and change shape and colour over time. He coded it in 6502 assembler language, fitting into about 1 kilobyte. Running the code for the first time had a profound effect on Minter: \\"It just felt wonderfully new, and somehow primal... it was like the patterns and mandalas that have fascinated humans for millennia, but come to life, under your control...\\" Originally, Minter intended the algorithm to be public domain and contributed an early version in listing form to a computer magazine. After encouragement from his parents, Minter eventually released an expanded version commercially as Pyschedelia. He continued to develop the light synthesizer concept, designing Colourspace (1985), Trip-a- Tron (1987), Virtual Light Machine (1990, 1994, 2000 and an unreleased version in 2003) and Neon (2004). Psychedelia, along with other older Llamasoft programs, has since become public domain software. Later the author released a variant for Apple devices including the source code.\\"Psychedelia\\" and source code also now up on the app store. All free of course! on twitter.com by Jeff Minter@llamasoft_ox (22 Jun 2015) Critical reception On its release Psychedelia received mixed reviews. Your Spectrum criticized the concept of a light synthesizer, describing Psychedelia as boring and awarding an average of 2/5. Sinclair User also only awarded 2 out of 5, finding the concept interesting but concluding that the games-buying public was the wrong demographic for this kind of software. In contrast, CRASH found the package great fun to play around with, describing the effects as fantastic, but criticizing the retail price and narrow appeal. The magazine featured Psychadelia on their October 1991 covertape.

Built in 1869 and twice enlarged substantially, it is notable for including the only surviving unaltered Second Empire school building in the city. The building served Worcester's public school students until 1976; the city sold the building in 1978. It now serves as a transitional housing facility for homeless families. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history The former Cambridge Street School is located in southern Worcester, at the south west corner of McKeon and Cambridge Streets. It is separated from Southbridge Street by a shopping center. The school consists of three conjoined structures that were built at different times. In 1869 the front section was built; it is a three-story mansard-roofed brick building designed by local architects E. Boyden & Son. It has a tall mansard roof, and its front facade has a slightly projecting central pavilion and projecting end sections. The cornice has corbelled brickwork, and the main entrance is sheltered by a wood-frame porch. In 1890 the school was expanded by the construction of a second brick building, a 2-1/2 story Romanesque Revival building, at the back (far southern edge) of the property. It has sandstone trim, and its main entrance faces east toward McKeon Street, sheltered by a gable-roofed porch supported by square brick and stone piers. Specifically Romanesque details are minimal, including a few round-arch windows. In 1916 a full three story Gothic Revival structure was built between the two. The school was built in response to growing industrial economic along the Southbridge Street corridor and the nearby railroad lines. An increase in carpet manufacturing in the area led to increased demand and the construction of the second building. The buildings served as a public school until 1976, and were sold by the city in 1978. They now serve as a transitional housing facility for homeless families.

It is estimated to have been built c. 1797, and is one of the few surviving Federal-style houses in the city. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history The Chadwick-Brittan House is located in a mixed residential-commercial area northeast of downtown Worcester, on the east side of Lincoln Street (Massachusetts Route 70) at Shaffner Street. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, two interior chimneys, and a clapboarded exterior. It has a five bay center entrance facade, typical of the period, although the entry has been given Greek Revival treatment, with sidelight windows and a portico supported by round columns. The dormers in the roof are a c. 1900 Colonial Revival addition. A two-story ell extends to the rear of the main block. The house has an uncertain early history, owing to a lack of period documentation. It is believed to have been in use as a tavern named the Chadwick Hotel c. 1800, but was in private ownership by 1833. In the mid-19th century it was owned by Josiah Brittan, a major local landowner and operator of a brickyard. In the late 19th century most of the land previously associated with the house was sold off for residential development. At that time, the house may have been moved slightly to make way for the laying out of Shaffner Street.

Description and history The Charles Chamberlain House was located west of downtown Worcester, on the south side of Pleasant Street between the city's Pleasant and Winslow Park, and the Worcester Seventh-Day Adventist Church, which it shared its lot with. It was a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with an L-shaped plan covered by gabled roofs. Its Victorian detailing was an eclectic mix, with spindled Stick style bargeboard in its gables, vertical board siding, a porch supported by delicate turned posts with foliate capitals, and decorated gable aprons. Sash windows were set in rectangular openings topped by lintels with peaked gables, and sills supported by small brackets. Charles Chamberlain, the first recorded owner, was the owner of a blade manufacturing firm, which also manufactured and repaired lawn mowers and other small machinery. The house was probably moved on its lot sometime between 1922 and 1938, in order to make room for the construction of the adjacent church.

The district uses the funding to provide full-day kindergarten and reduced class size K-3rd grade. =Classrooms for the Future grant= The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006 to 2009. The School District was denied funding by the PDE in 2006-07 and in 2007‚Äì08. The district received $162,699 in 2008‚Äì09. In Blair County the highest award was given to Altoona Area School District getting $597,806. The highest funding statewide was awarded to Philadelphia City School District in Philadelphia County - $9,409,073. In 2010, Classrooms for the Future funding was curtailed statewide due to a massive state financial crisis. Federal Stimulus grant The district received an extra $3,880,055 in ARRA - Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding was limited to the 2009‚Äì10 and 2010-2011 school years. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software. =Race to the Top grant= District officials applied for the federal Race to the Top grant which would have provided over nearly million dollars in additional federal funding to improve student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.Race to the Top Fund, U.S. Department of Education, March 29, 2010. Other grants Hollidaysburg Area School District did not participate in the PreK Counts grants, the Striving Readers Comprehensive Literacy grant of 2012 nor the Science It Elementary grants of 2007‚Äì2010. Real estate taxes Property tax rates in 2012-13 were set by the school board at 97.5000 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When the school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders. *2011-12 - 97.5000 mills. *2010-11 - 97.5000 mills *2009-10 - 130.0000 mills. *2008-09 - 130.0000 mills. *2007-08 - 123.4769 mills. *2006-07 - 118.5000 mills. *2005-06 - 118.5000 mills. According to a report prepared by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the total real estate taxes collected by all school districts in Pennsylvania rose from $6,474,133,936 in 1999‚Äì00 to $10,438,463,356 in 2008‚Äì09.Pennsylvania School Finances - Summaries of Annual Financial Report Data 2008-09 The average yearly property tax paid by Blair County residents amounts to about 1.99% of their yearly income. Blair County is ranked 1441st of the 3143 United States counties for property taxes as a percentage of median income.Blair County Property Taxes 2012, Tax rates.org, 2012 =Act 1 Adjusted Index= The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not permitted to raise property taxes above that Index unless they either: allow voters to vote by referendum or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011‚Äì2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten exceptions to the Act 1 Index. Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate.

For 2012‚Äì2013, 274 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 223 school districts adopted a preliminary budget leaving open the option of exceeded the Index limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Report on Referendum Exceptions For School Year 2012-2013, March 30, 2012 For the 2011‚Äì12 school year, the Hollidaysburg Area School Board did not apply for an exception to exceed the Act 1 Index. Each year, the Hollidaysburg Area School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011‚Äì2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index. Of the districts who sought exceptions: 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction. Extracurriculars The district offers an extensive variety of clubs, activities and a plethora of costly sports. Eligibility for participation is determined by school board policy. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students residing in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools.

On the second level, a three-part round-arch window is set above the entrance under a stylized cap. The gable of the projecting section has Stick style bargeboard, and is flanked at the roof level by gabled dormers with a simplified version of the same decoration. Windows on the side elevations have bracketed sills and lintels, with the first-floor lintels capped by gabled cornices, and those on the second floor flat. A two-story polygonal bay projects from the right side, just below a steeply pitched gable. The house was built about 1875, and was first occupied by George Cobb, a fish and oyster merchant.

It is now mostly occupied by residences. Description and history Colton's Block is located in downtown Worcester, on the west side of Main Street between the Federal Plaza parking garage and the Babcock Block. It consists of three separate four-story brick buildings with nearly identical styling. Each is four bays wide, with a single storefront on the ground floor; the central entrance now provides access to the upper floors. The three buildings are articulated by slightly projecting piers, which rise to a band of corbelled brickwork and a common projecting cornice studded with paired brackets. The leftmost building has slightly larger windows on the second floor than those elsewhere (an alteration dating to about 1900). The buildings were likely built in the 1860s by Samuel Colton, who published the Worcester Spy before branching out into other businesses, including real estate development. These types of buildings were once quite common in downtown Worcester, and these are now the only ones left. The earliest documented occupants were dry goods retailers and wholesalers.

It gained independent university status in 1990. UBU Main library History  Ubon Ratchathani University (UBU) was founded in 1987 as a regional campus of Khon Kaen University. It was established as a university by the Royal Charter in 1990. It aims to provide educational opportunities for the people of North-East Thailand, servicing specifically the provinces of Amnat Charoen, Mukdahan, Nakhon Phanom, Sakon Nakhon, Si Sa Ket, Ubon Ratchathani, and Yasothon. However, UBU also welcomes, encourages and has students from outside cities, such as Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Songkhla, etc. to learn more about the Isan culture, while also recruiting and hosting international students from countries such as Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Cameroon, South Sudan and more! The university supports and encourages research that benefits the local, national, and international communities, and promotes activities that preserve the cultural identity of the area. The university is located on Sathonlamark Road (Warin-Detudom Road), 15 kilometres south of Ubon Ratchathani city. It is easily accessible by public transportation from the airport, the numerous bus terminals in Ubon Ratchathani, and the train station in Warin. The campus is spacious and is situated in a rural setting, occupying approximately 5,300 rai (848 hectares). UBU is situated in an up and coming small city setting, occupying approximately 2,100 acres (848 hectares). Its student population totals around 15,000 students. The University‚Äôs logo is in the form of a Lan Chang period chedi, a religious structure common in Isan. The chedi contains a lotus blossom resting upon a three-tiered pedestal representing the main rivers of the province, the Mekhong, the Chii and the Moon. The two bottom petals of the blossom represent the qualities of morality and intellectuality that the University strives to develop in its students. The three top petals represent the ‚ÄúTriple Gem‚Äù of Buddhism, a recognised pathway to happiness. The pink of the lotus is the official colour of the province, and the blue outline of the logo represents the strength and stability of the University. The yellow background is the official colour of the University. The symbolic tree of the University is the Kan-Krao, a fragrant yellow flowering tree that grows prolifically on campus. Kan-Krao can grow even in infertile soil. Its timber is very hard and can withstand termites, so it is excellent in the construction of houses and furniture. The tree represents the strength and unity of the university working towards the future.

Avenida Figueroa Alcorta is a major thoroughfare in Buenos Aires, Argentina, with a length of over along the city's northside. History The rapid northward growth of the city of Buenos Aires during the late nineteenth century was facilitated by plans for a number of boulevards in the area by Mayor Torcuato de Alvear. Shortly after the opening of Viceroy V√©rtiz Avenue (today Avenida del Libertador) in 1906, a parallel boulevard was begun to serve the numerous upscale neighborhoods planned for the largely undeveloped northside.palermonline.com Planned with the assistance of French Argentine urbanist Carlos Thays and around his recent remodeling of Parque Tres de Febrero, the thoroughfare was opened on the 1910 centennial of the May Revolution that led to independence and was, accordingly, named Avenida Centenario. Thays also designed a new residential neighborhood anchored around the new avenue: Barrio Parque, opened for development in 1912.todopropiedades.com The Sanitation Works Commission's massive water reclamation plant was subsequently built along the avenue's northern stretch. Excavations along the avenue in 2008 uncovered remains of the former Hansen's Caf√©. Location of Avenida Figueroa Alcorta in Buenos Aires. Chrysler Motors opened an assembly plant on the avenue in 1932 (since demolished), an investment complemented by a testing facility housed in an ornate structure north of Barrio Parque (the former facility today houses condominiums and an automobile museum). The northern end of the avenue became home to the River Plate Football Club's monumental stadium, finished in 1938.sitioriverplatense.com The avenue was later graced by tennis and country clubs, parks and a number of monumental public buildings, though its boulevard medians were removed around 1970 to accommodate growing traffic. Excavations along the avenue in 2008 uncovered remains of the former Hansen's Caf√©, among the city's first and most popular tango redoubts until its demolition in 1912.Clar√≠n Itinerary Bridge over Figueroa Alcorta Avenue (2013) A one way thoroughfare, the avenue begins at its eastern end past the Buenos Aires Palais de Glace in the upscale Recoleta section. Passing by the University of Buenos Aires Law School, the monumental Neoclassic structure dating from the administration of President Juan Per√≥n (who had it built in the early 1950s as the future headquarters of the CGT, Argentina's largest labor union), the avenue also travels behind the National Fine Arts Museum and past United Nations Plaza. There, architect Eduardo Catalano installed the iconic Floralis Gen√©rica in 2001. Past UN Plaza, the avenue passes by Argentine Public Television Studios, an extensive Modernist structure opened in 1978 and known locally for its roof garden. The studios are visually complemented by the reflecting pools in Rub√©n Dar√≠o Plaza and by the Chilean Embassy, a smaller, modernist building built in 1969. Behind the adjoining Chile Plaza, the San Mart√≠n National Institute and monument to Jos√© de San Mart√≠n anchor the leafy Barrio Parque neighborhood. The Institute is housed in a 1946 replica of the Liberator's Boulogne-sur-Mer residence in his later years. Along the other side of the avenue, businessman Eduardo Constantini opened his Latin American Art Museum of Buenos Aires (MALBA) in 2001. Passing by the Buenos Aires Japanese Gardens in the Palermo section of the city, the avenue leaves its residential surroundings, traveling through parks and other public areas for the remaining stretches. Cutting through urbanist Carlos Thays' vast Parque Tres de Febrero, it affords a view of his extensive rose garden and of the Galileo Galilei planetarium, opened in 1966. The intersection with Sarmiento Avenue features Renzo Baldi and H√©ctor Rocha's Monument to General Justo Jos√© de Urquiza.
