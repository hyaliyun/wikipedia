Four trains operate daily (two round trips) on this route: 311 and 313 westbound, and 314 and 316 eastbound. History The Missouri River Runner route was previously served by the Missouri Mules (known as the Kansas City Mule westbound and the St. Louis Mule eastbound) and the Ann Rutledge under the Missouri Service brand. The Missouri Service, in turn, ran along the former main line of the Missouri Pacific Railroad. Several of MoPac's St. Louis-Kansas City trains continued onward to Omaha and Denver. Missouri Pacific was acquired by the Union Pacific Railroad in 1983. When Amtrak took over nationwide passenger service in 1971, the route became the western leg of the National Limited, which originated in New York. This was the first passenger train on the route to originate at a point east of the Mississippi River. It was the successor of the famed Spirit of St. Louis, which was extended to Kansas City after Amtrak's formation and renamed later in 1971. When the National Limited was canceled in 1979, the only train serving the St. Louis-Kansas City corridor was the Chicago-Kansas City Ann Rutledge. Missouri officials pressed for the introduction of the Mules in order to maintain and improve service between St. Louis and Kansas City. Over the ensuing years of state subsidy, additional station stops were established at Washington, Hermann, Lee's Summit and Independence. The Ann Rutledge had previously been part of both the Missouri Service and Illinois Service, but had its eastern terminus cut back to St. Louis in 2006. This gave the St. Louis-Kansas City route two daily round trips on a schedule similar to the last pre-Amtrak MoPac service. The Chicago-St. Louis State House connected once per day with the Ann Rutledge to continue through service from Chicago to Kansas City. In 1984, Amtrak's Jefferson City depot and ticket office was moved from the former MoPac station to a renovated historic building east of the depot but closer to the Missouri State Capitol. It was hoped the relocated station would allow tourists and others easier access to the state government buildings. Jefferson City is not on an interstate highway; the nearest airport is in Columbia. The revived station stop at Hermann was instituted in similar fashion to encourage use of Amtrak for access the city's popular German festivals. In 2008, Amtrak and MoDOT decided to merge the Mules and Ann Rutledge into a single route. The name of the new route was announced in January 2009 as part of the \\"Name The Train\\" contest held by the Missouri Department of Transportation.Amtrak - Missouri River Runner The winning name was submitted by Keith Kohler of Glendale, Missouri; it reflects the fact that the route largely parallels the Missouri River. The other finalists were Missouri Rail Blazer, ShowMeMO, Truman Service and River Cities Corridor. The service is financed primarily through funds made available by the Missouri Department of Transportation. In November 2009, Amtrak and Union Pacific completed an $8.1 million siding near California, Missouri, designed to improve performance along the route. The siding, funded by the state of Missouri and the Federal Railroad Administration, was credited with helping improve Amtrak's on-time performance. Due to these improvements, on time performance has increased from less than 70% to 95%. During fiscal year 2015, the service carried a total of 178,915 passengers, a 5.5% decrease from FY 2014's total of 189,402 passengers. The trains had a total revenue of $5,108,200 during FY 2015, a decrease of 4.4% from FY 2014's total of $5,341,229. As of October 1, 2013, provisions of the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 prohibit Amtrak from using its federal operating grant to share the cost of the Missouri River Runner route; the 2008 act prohibits cost-sharing on any route shorter than . By 2020, the State of Missouri owed Amtrak $6.5 million in unpaid bills in addition to that year's contract amount for continued service. One daily Runner round trip connects with the Chicago-St. Louis Lincoln Service, successor of the State House.

History Rizzani was established in Udine, Italy in 1831. Over the following century, Rizzani developed its presence in Italy and ventured in several countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. In 1948 Riccardo De Eccher established the company bearing his name in the northern Italian region of Trentino Alto Adige engaging in real estate development. In 1970 Riccardo De Eccher takes over Rizzani. Ten years later, the construction of two segments of the Carnia-Tarvisio motorway marked the acquisition of technologies for prefabrication and launching of overhead bridges. These technologies will be constantly developed over the successive years and finally consolidated into Deal S.r.l., a group affiliate specialized in advanced bridge construction technologies. In 1982 the first important overseas project of Rizzani De Eccher was acquired - five schools in Algeria. In 1984 five landmark projects were acquired in what was then the Soviet Union, becoming the first registered Western contractor in the Soviet Union, and marking the beginning of a successful expansion in Russia. The following years were marked by a swift growth. The Group's consolidated revenues grew from 37 billion lira in 1986 to 228 billion lira in 1990. In 1994 the difficult conditions of the infrastructure and construction Italian market, generally related to mani pulite, the Company decided to focus towards overseas markets. In 2004 Rizzani de Eccher first appeared in the top ten Italian contractors and in the world's 100 largest contractors rankings compiled by Engineering News-Record. By 2005, through its established presence in many countries (Russia and other CIS countries, Middle East, Mediterranean Basin and North and Central America), the share of overseas revenues tops 70%. It operates in four areas of activity: general building, infrastructure development, equipment manufacturing and specialised engineering for bridges and viaducts and real estate development.

The airfield was renamed Vernam Air Force Base by the newly formed United States Air Force in 1948, but was closed in 1949. History The base was named in honor of First Lieutenant Remington de Bremont Vernam (March 24, 1896 – December 1, 1918), an American pilot who entered the French air service during World War I. Vernam was shot down behind German lines on October 30, 1918. After the Armistice he was found by American forces in a hospital in Longwey, France, with another wounded aviator, Lt. Arthur C. Dineen. Vernam died of his wounds on December 1. He is buried in the American cemetery at St. Mihiel in Thiaucourt, France, and was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross (United States). World War II The airfield has its origin in the 1940 Destroyers for Bases Agreement between Great Britain and the United States. For material support in the allied war effort, Britain agreed to lease as potential naval and air bases to the United States at several locations in the Americas. The development of Vernam Field was viewed initially by the Army Air Corps as a staging field for training and for the operations of Borinquen Field, Puerto Rico. It was given its designation on 14 June 1941, and a force of 200 officers and enlisted men (known as \\"Force Tuna\\") embarked from New York and arrived on 17 November as a survey party to establish the airfield. The design of the airfield was upgraded to that of a bomber airfield, and consisted of three runways: a 6000-foot concrete runway and two shorter asphalt runways to accommodate crosswind landings. When officially activated on 21 November 1941, the station was assigned to the 24th Composite Wing, Sixth Air Force, which controlled (in addition to this base) Atkinson, Beane, Coolidge, Ramey and Waller Fields in the Antilles Air Command. Constructions of airfield runways and a support station was ongoing throughout 1942, and the first operational unit did not arrive until September. With the United States entry into the war in December, the primary mission of Vernam Field was antisubmarine patrols in the Northern Caribbean. In addition, the Florida-based Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics would send student groups to Vernam for advanced base operations training in combat tactics, returning to Florida after completion. By 1944, the airfield had fallen into \\"backwater\\" status, as the anti-submarine war in the Caribbean had moved much further south towards South America and Panama. After the departure of the 35th Bomb Squadron, the remaining units assigned to the field were a detachment of the 10588th Ordnance Company and the 305th Signal Company, along with a medical detachment. On 30 June 1944, Eleanor Roosevelt visited the station. In early 1945, Vernam Field became the destination for many B-29 Superfortress aircraft from Second Air Force training flights originating from training bases in Kansas and Nebraska (approximately 2,000 miles distant). The B-29s would fly on cross-country training flights to Vernam and land at the airfield for refueling and maintenance before returning to the Midwest. It was, unfortunately, the site of several B-29 crashes. Postwar use With the end of the war, Vernam Field was reduced in scope to a skeleton staff. By the end of 1946 only two aircraft, a C-45 and a C-47 were assigned to the station with both aircraft being down for parts and minimal maintenance being undertaken. It was placed under the command of the 24th Composite Wing, Headquartered at Borinquen AFB, Puerto Rico. The airfield became a training destination for early jet aircraft cross country flights, with P-80 Shooting Stars, F-84 Thunderjets and early F-86A Sabres using its long wartime bomber runways. The airfield was redesignated Vernam Air Force Base on March 26, 1948, by Department of the Air Force General Order Number 10. The mission of the base was primarily weather reporting, with a detachment of the Military Air Transport Service (MATS) 6th Weather Squadron (Regional) being the primary unit on the base. It also became a destination for long-range Strategic Air Command fighter escort aircraft, with F-82 Twin Mustangs flying to Vernam from Kearney AFB, Nebraska then returning on cross-country training flights. President Harry S. Truman visited Vernam AFB on 30 June 1948 during a tour of the Caribbean. Vernam AFB closed on 28 May 1949 due to budgetary cutbacks. After closure, the base was essentially abandoned and all structures were removed or torn down. The facility has been derelict for decades. The only use of the former airfield area has been an automobile racetrack known as Vernamfield which uses some of the old runways and taxiways.

In September 2008 it was announced that as part of this development Jamaica's military, the Jamaica Defence Force (JDF), was to be moved to Vernam Field from its historic city centre site at Up Park Camp in Kingston. By June 2009 the JDF had secured the site and it was reported that the Vernam Airfield Development Project was to build an initial 10,000-11,000 foot runway and adjoining taxi ways capable of handling the largest contemporary aircraft including the Antonov An-124, Antonov An-225 and the Airbus A380.

The museum's mission is to demonstrate the history of scientific discovery through the preservation, restoration, and demonstration of the scientific instruments and technologies. The Niagara Science Museum houses a collection of over 2,000 scientific instruments and technologies dating from the 1700s to the present. Overview The Niagara Science Museum was founded by Nick Dalacu, a physicist who amassed a personal collection of hundreds of historically significant instruments and technologies over four decades. The museum presents its collection in 'living laboratories' in the style of the wunderkammern, or cabinet of curiosity, of Renaissance Europe. Its dozen rooms include laboratories dedicated to high-voltage electronics and galvanometers, a large collection of microscopes and optics, meteorological instruments, communication and media technologies, hydraulics and vacuum technologies, medical technologies, computing history, and others. It also houses the Charlie Troutman Printing Press Room, a working letterpress studio using a 1914 Chandler & Price press. The museum is housed in the former Union Carbide building, built in 1910, and restored to house the museum's collection, and is currently powered by an array of solar cells on its roof. The museum has offered public demonstrations of its collection, including as a part of Atlas Obscura's Obscura Day in 2010 and 2011, visits from regional schools, and has been invited to exhibit artifacts from its collection at the University at Buffalo and Buffalo State College. The museum is also open to the public for visits. In 2010, the museum received a large donation of historically significant artifacts from the early days of electrical production. In 2011, the Niagara Science Museum was certified as a not-for- profit educational corporation with a charter by the Board of Regents of the State University of New York.

Bosniaks in the camp were subject to killings, mistreatment, rapes, detention and murders. The camp Conditions at Vojno Camp were harsh and unhealthy, with overcrowding, insufficient food and water, poor ventilation, insufficient bedding and inadequate sanitation facilities. The HVO physically and mentally abused Bosniak men detained at the Vojno Camp on a daily basis. Herceg-Bosna/HVO forces killed at least thirteen Bosniak men while they were detained at Vojno Camp and injured many others. The HVO forces routinely beat Bosniak men with fists, feet, rubber batons and various wooden objects. Bosniak men were subjected to electrical shocks, often forced to beat each other and otherwise abused and humiliated. Bosniak detainees were forced to witness the summary execution of other detainees. Detainees were often subjected to particularly severe mistreatment in retaliation for ABiH military successes. Bosniak men detained at Vojno Camp, together with Bosniak men detained at the Heliodrom (who were often sent to Vojno Camp on a seven-day rotation) were used in forced labour in the Vojno area. The forced labour included building military fortifications, digging trenches, carrying ammunition to HVO soldiers, and retrieving killed and injured HVO soldiers, often along the confrontation line and in the midst of combat conditions. Bosniak men engaged in such labour were regularly exposed to mortar, sniper and other small arms fire, and at least thirty-nine Bosniak men were killed or wounded. The HVO detained approximately fifty civilian Bosniak women and girls (together with their small children) at Vojno Camp, from approximately June to December 1993. The Bosniak women and others were held without any genuine or bona fide effort by the HVO to determine their status or distinguish military detainees from civilians. Neither did the HVO provide for the civilians’ release or transfer to a safe location. HVO soldiers repeatedly raped and sexually assaulted approximately fifty civilian Bosniak women and girls detained at Vojno Camp. Such episodes of sexual assault were often preceded or accompanied by beatings or threats that non-compliance would result in the woman's child (or children) being killed. Bosniak children detained at the Vojno Camp were regularly exposed to cruel treatment, hunger and separation from their mothers, resulting in physical suffering and trauma to these, some of the younger victims of the Herceg-Bosna/HVO persecution and cleansing. Recent developments Marko Radić, Dragan Šunjić, Damir Brekalo and Mirko Vračević were found guilty of having participated, as members of the Croatian Defence Council in the killings, mistreatments, rapes, detention and murders of the detained Bosniaks. The Bosnian State Court sentenced Marko Radić to 25 years in prison, Dragan Šunjić to 21 years, Damir Brekalo to 20 and Mirko Vračević to 14. Their sentences were reduced in a second-instance verdict to 21, 16, 20 and 12 years respectively. The highest-ranking surviving leaders Jadranko Prlić, Bruno Stojić, Slobodan Praljak, Milivoj Petković, Valentin Corić, Berislav Pušić were charged with crimes against humanity, grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions and violations of the laws of war.

It is one of the first museums in Russia and one of the world’s largest naval museums, with a large collection of artefacts, models and paintings reflecting the development of Russian naval traditions and the history of the Russian Navy. The museum’s permanent display includes such relics as the Botik of Peter the Great, Catherine II’s marine throne, trophies captured in sea battles, and the personal belongings of prominent Russian and Soviet naval commanders. The collection includes paintings by Ivan Aivazovsky, Alexey Bogolyubov, Lev Lagorio and other marine artists, ship sculpture, navigational instruments, naval equipment and machinery from the 17th to 20th centuries and numerous models of ships. The main exposition consists of nineteen halls. There is a complex of six museum halls for exhibitions.  History   Imperial era  The museum originates from the St. Petersburg Model Chamber, used to store models and drawings related to shipbuilding. The Model Chamber was first mentioned in records on 24 January 1709, the date now used as the birthday of the museum. Peter I, who at the time was with his army in the Ukraine, sent instructions to Alexander Kikin, reading : “Take the Model Chamber out of my house and place it by the shipyard, wherever a proper place is available …”. The Model Chamber was located in the Main Admiralty, where ships of the Baltic Fleet were built. Dzhevetskiy submarine Botik of Peter the Great The Model Chamber's collection became the basis for a \\"Maritime Museum\\", which was created in 1805. By the end of the nineteenth century the Maritime Museum had become a significant Russian cultural and scientific centre, known throughout the world. The museum was renamed after its founder, Peter the Great, in 1908, before the celebration of the 200th anniversary of the museum. It was renamed several times in the following years, becoming the Central Naval Museum in 1924.  Soviet era  In August 1939 the Central Naval Museum was relocated to the Stock Exchange building. It opened in its new location in February 1941, but its work was interrupted four months later by the German invasion of the Soviet Union and the beginning of the Great Patriotic War. The museum's most valuable exhibits were evacuated to Ulyanovsk. In July 1946 the museum returned to its home in Leningrad and reopened to visitors. After the war work began on creating a modern network of branches of the Central Naval Museum. In 1956 a branch was opened using the cruiser Aurora, the first museum ship in Russia. In 1972 a second branch was opened in the village of Osinovets, on the shore of Lake Ladoga, dedicated to the \\"Road of Life\\". A third branch was opened in the Kronstadt Naval Cathedral in 1980, detailing the history of the fortress of Kronstadt. In 1994 the submarine Narodovolets was opened as a new branch of the museum, and the first submarine museum ship in Russia. I-16 fighter of Twice-Hero of the Soviet Union Lt. Col. Boris Safonov  The museum today  The museum supports business relationships and organizes joint exhibitions with dozens of Russian and foreign museums. During the three centuries of its existence, the museum has collected more than 700,000 objects that reflect the most important events in the history of the fleet. There are over 13,000 items of naval equipment, 11,000 weapons and firearms, 62,000 works of art, 56,000 uniforms, awards and decorations, flags and banners, and 44,000 documents and manuscripts, together with around 300,000 photographs and negatives, and sheets of drawings. The museum has one of the world's richest collections of model ships (about 2,000 models), covering the history of Russian and foreign military shipbuilding. In 2012 the Museum of the Baltic Fleet, in Baltiysk, and the retired Sverdlov- class cruiser Mikhail Kutuzov, in Novorossiysk, became branches of the Central Naval Museum. In 2013, the collection was moved from the Stock Exchange to a new building in the renovated complex “Kryukov (Marine) barracks”, at Ploshchad Truda in the Admiralteysky District of the city.

This site and the nearby Rock Prairie settlement outside Orfordville, Wisconsin served as centers for both Norwegian immigration and developments within the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.History of Clinton and the Surrounding Area (The Clinton Community Resources Guide. Village of Clinton, Wisconsin 1998) The unincorporated community of Bergen, Rock County, Wisconsin is in the vicinity of Jefferson Prairie Settlement. Background Ole Knudsen Nattestad and Ansten Nattestad, two brothers from the valley of Numedal in southeastern Norway, emigrated in 1837. Numedal is a traditional district located in the county of Buskerud, Norway. Together the Nattestad brothers played a key role in promoting immigration from Norway and for directing immigrants to southern Wisconsin and northern Illinois. Ole Knutson Nattestad first came to the Town of Clinton in 1838. Ansten Nattestad returned to Norway to have the letters of Ole Rynning published. Ole Rynning (1809-1838) had been an early immigrant living in Beaver Creek, Iroquois County, Illinois. Rynning's work was published as True Account of America (Norwegian: Sandfærdig Beretning om Amerika).Ole Rynning's true account of America (translated and edited by Theodore C. Blegen. Norwegian-American Historical Association, Minneapolis. 1926) The return trip of Ansten Nattestad to Norway was instrumental in promoting interest in America. Ansten Nattestad organized more than a hundred emigrants and led them to Wisconsin, arriving in September, 1839. Some joined Ole Nattestad at Jefferson Prairie; others settled in nearby Rock Prairie. The Jefferson Prairie Lutheran Church was organized in 1844. Pioneer Lutheran Minister, Claus Lauritz Clausen, accepted a call during 1846 from Norwegian- settlers at Jefferson Prairie. He relocated from the Muskego Settlement and made Rock County the center for his activities among the settlements in southern Wisconsin and northern Illinois, remaining until 1853. Clausen based part of his efforts from Rock Prairie, which he rechristened Luther Valley.\\"Luther Valley Has a Thriving Church\\". Janesville Gazette, November 9, 1929.Blaine Hansen. \\"The Norwegians of Luther Valley\\". Wisconsin Magazine of History, vol 28, no. 4 (June 1945): 422-430. During 1846, the Eielsen Synod, a Norwegian Lutheran church body, was founded at Jefferson Prairie by a group led by Elling Eielsen. In 1853, the Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (the \\"Norwegian Synod\\") was organized at Luther Valley. The organizing meeting of the Augustana Synod was held at Jefferson Prairie in June 1860.Nelson, E. Clifford, and Fevold, Eugene L.

He grew up in the Waterland, a marshy area in the Northwest Netherlands, and had a lifelong interest in aquatic plants. Career De Wit studied biology at the University of Amsterdam from 1931-1937. In 1937 he left for Pretoria, South Africa, where he worked as an agricultural research officer with the Department of Agriculture. In 1941 he obtained his Ph.D. with a thesis on the genus Setaria from the grass family (Poaceae). In the same year, he moved to the Dutch East Indies (nowadays Indonesia). During World War II de Wit worked in the 's Lands Plantentuin te Buitenzorg. After his return to The Netherlands in 1946 he worked for the Flora Malesiana Foundation. De Wit was a gifted teacher and on 20 September 1953 he became a lecturer at Leiden University where he taught plant taxonomy and morphology of flowering plants and on 1 November of the same year also at the Wageningen University and Research Centre, where he taught taxonomy and tropical and subtropical plant geography. In 1959 he left Leiden to become full professor in Wageningen and on 15 September 1969 he became the head of the Laboratory of Plant Taxonomy and Plant Geography there. De Wit retired in 1980, at which occasion a Festschrift was published in his honour. Scientific work De Wit was especially interested in the Aroid genus Cryptocoryne, as well as the closely related Lagenandra on which he published extensively. In all, he described 21 new species of Cryptocoryne and 6 species of the related genus Lagenandra. A lifelong hobby were freshwater aquaria and in the late 1950s he edited an encyclopaedia for aquarists in 15 volumes, 2 of which (volumes 5 and 6) dealt with aquarium plants and were written by himself. In 1966 these volumes were revised and published together as the first edition of his book Aquariumplanten was published. It was translated in English in 1964 and in German in 1971. After his retirement, he wrote a history of biology (Ontwikkelingsgeschiedenis van de biologie) in three volumes (1982–1989). A popularized version appeared in 1993 (Wat is leven? Een cultuurgeschiedenis van de biologie).  Primitiae Africanae  The first results of research workers in African botanical taxonomy, prepared under supervision of de Wit, were published in a series named Primitiae Africanae. Twelve articles were published in total, in different taxonomic journals.  Eponymous species  Several plant species were named in his honour, such as Begonia bonus-henricus J.J. de Wilde, Crudia dewitii Kostermans, Cryptocoryne dewitii Jacobsen, Homalium dewitii Kostermans, Bauhinia dewitii K.Larsen & S.S.Larsen, Rinorea dewitii Achound., and Lagenandra dewitii Crusio et de Graaf.

She was configured with a full length spar deck which was enclosed above the main deck.\\"American Lloyd's Register of American and Foreign Shipping\\", 1861.\\"Ship Registers & Enrollments of Providence, R.I.\\", Survey of Federal Archives, 1941. Curlew sank off of Point Judith, Rhode Island in May 1859 when a steam pipe burst and she began to fill with water. She was salvaged and a new boiler and engine were installed in 1860. Civil War service Curlew was purchased for $44,000 by the U.S. Navy in 1861 during the American Civil War for the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron.\\"Official Records of the Union and Confederate Navies in the War of the Rebellion\\", Series II - Vol. 1, p. 69. She was outfitted as a gunboat with armament consisting of a 30-pounder rifled gun on the foredeck and six 32-pounder smoothbores on the main deck. Curlew participated in the expedition to Port Royal, South Carolina under the command of Acting Lieutenant P.G. Watmough. When her machinery proved to be inadequate she was towed to New York by the transport Baltic arriving on 21 November 1861 to be returned to her owners before the sixty-day trial period expired.\\"Official Records of the Union and Confederate Navies in the War of the Rebellion\\", Series I - Vol. 12, p. 354. Curlew was chartered by the Quartermaster's Department in October 1862 and voyaged as far as New Orleans, Louisiana under Captain H.N. Parrish. In the panic over the commerce raider , Curlew was again chartered in June 1863 for use as a gunboat, this time by the Navy Department. She was returned in October of that year. Final voyage Back in commercial service Curlew inaugurated a freight service between New York and Baltimore, Maryland. She cleared Baltimore on 5 November 1863 and proceeded down the bay for New York with a full cargo. Near midnight on a dark, cloudy night she collided with the northbound steamer Louisiana near Point Lookout, Maryland hitting Louisiana near midships on the port side. Curlew sank but Captain Parrish and the crew rowed to safety at Point Lookout. Louisiana suffered damage and was towed to Baltimore. Notes on tonnage Curlew was listed in the Custom House Register in Providence at 343 tons burden. The register dimensions shown in the box also result in that number when entered in the contemporary tonnage equation. The New York Marine Register and the succeeding American Lloyds Register both show 380 tons. The Navy appears to quote 380 tons from those registers. In February 1862 the registration was changed to New York and the tonnage remeasured at 557. Other vessels A ferryboat Curlew of 392 tons, which was built in 1853, was purchased by the Quartermaster's Department for use during the Civil War.

It is located near the entrance of Icheri Sheher, not far from the Fountains Square. The museum is considered one of the greatest and richest treasuries of Azerbaijani culture. Main goals Collection, research and storage of scientific and other materials about Azerbaijani literature and culture, presentation of these materials on expositions and exhibitions is the main goal of the museum. There are carried out great scientific researches, published and written books and monographs. History of the museum View from the bottom. Sculptures in the upper floor. The building where the museum is located was built in 1850, as a one-storeyed caravanserais. In 1915, the building was given to “Metropol” hotel and the second storey was rebuilt. Then, in 1918-1920s, workers of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic lived and worked there; in 1920-30s the labor union soviet of Azerbaijan was located there. On November 1, 1939, according to the order of the Council of People’s Commissars of the Azerbaijan SSR under the number № 4972, a memorial museum named after Nizami was created in this building in connection with the 800th anniversary of the Persian poet Nizami Ganjavi. The building was overhauled by the project of architects Sadikh Dadashov and Mikayil Huseynov, were placed sculptures in the façade and reconstructed two floors. Later, the memorial museum was changed to the Museum of Azerbaijani Literature. Interior of the museum was designed by Letif Kerimov. During World War II, when the 800th anniversary of the Persian poet Nizami Ganjavi was celebrated in Leningrad Blockade, the placement work of the museum’s exposition was continued. On May 14, 1945, the museum opened its doors to its visitors only after the victory in the Great Patriotic War, in spite of that, the museum was established in 1939. Twice, in 1959 and 1967, the museum was overhauled, expanded and upgraded. In 2001-2003, the museum was changed again. In summer, 2005, after the visit of Ilham Aliyev-the President of Azerbaijan on December 30, 2004, were prepared new projects, on the basis of which the museum was overhauled and renewed. The Cabinet of Ministers of Azerbaijan Republic assigned 13 million manats for that reason. Area of the exposition was expanded 2500 square meters, and the number of halls upgraded to 30 main and 10 auxiliary. If there were demonstrated only 1000 of 120000 exhibits till the reconstruction, after the reconstruction the number of them reached 25000. The building The total area of the museum is 2500 square meters, the 1409 meters of which consists of exposition and 173 square meters of fond. There are more than 3000 manuscripts, rare books, illustrations, portraits, sculptures, miniatures, memories of poets and other exhibits in 30 general and 10 auxiliary halls of the museum’s exposition. Part of the museum is a book shop. The sculptures of the eminent Azerbaijani poets and writers were placed on the façade of the museum on the following way: Muhammad Fuzuli (sculptor: F. Abdurrahmanov), Molla Panah Vagif (sculptor: S. Klyatskiy), Mirza Fatali Akhundov (sculptor: P.Sabsai), Khurshidbanu Natavan (sculptor: Y. Tripolskaya), Jalil Mammadguluzadeh (sculptor: N.Zakharov), and Jafar Jabbarly (sculptor: S. Klyatskiy). There are 120000 exemplars of the museum exhibits stored in the fond of the museum. Exhibits A manuscript of Nizami’s Eskandar Nameh in Persian language, which was written in 1413, exemplar of a manuscript of Fuzuli’s “Bangu-Bade” (1569), “The Eastern poem about Pushkin’s decease” of Mirza Fatali Akhundov, personal autographs and other exhibits and expositions of great value are prides of the museum.

Details An example of EBL using a perfect domain theory is a program that learns to play chess through example. A specific chess position that contains an important feature such as \\"Forced loss of black queen in two moves\\" includes many irrelevant features, such as the specific scattering of pawns on the board. EBL can take a single training example and determine what are the relevant features in order to form a generalization.Black-queen example from A domain theory is perfect or complete if it contains, in principle, all information needed to decide any question about the domain. For example, the domain theory for chess is simply the rules of chess. Knowing the rules, in principle, it is possible to deduce the best move in any situation. However, actually making such a deduction is impossible in practice due to combinatoric explosion. EBL uses training examples to make searching for deductive consequences of a domain theory efficient in practice. In essence, an EBL system works by finding a way to deduce each training example from the system's existing database of domain theory. Having a short proof of the training example extends the domain-theory database, enabling the EBL system to find and classify future examples that are similar to the training example very quickly. The main drawback of the method---the cost of applying the learned proof macros, as these become numerous---was analyzed by Minton.  Basic formulation EBL software takes four inputs: * a hypothesis space (the set of all possible conclusions) * a domain theory (axioms about a domain of interest) * training examples (specific facts that rule out some possible hypothesis) * operationality criteria (criteria for determining which features in the domain are efficiently recognizable, e.g. which features are directly detectable using sensors) After stating the common definition, the paper actually argues against it in favor of more-refined criteria.  Application  An especially good application domain for an EBL is natural language processing (NLP). Here a rich domain theory, i.e., a natural language grammar---although neither perfect nor complete, is tuned to a particular application or particular language usage, using a treebank (training examples). Rayner pioneered this work. The first successful industrial application was to a commercial NL interface to relational databases. The method has been successfully applied to several large-scale natural language parsing systems, where the utility problem was solved by omitting the original grammar (domain theory) and using specialized LR-parsing techniques, resulting in huge speed-ups, at a cost in coverage, but with a gain in disambiguation. EBL-like techniques have also been applied to surface generation, the converse of parsing. When applying EBL to NLP, the operationality criteria can be hand-crafted, or can be inferred from the treebank using either the entropy of its or-nodes or a target coverage/disambiguation trade-off (= recall/precision trade-off = f-score). EBL can also be used to compile grammar-based language models for speech recognition, from general unification grammars. Note how the utility problem, first exposed by Minton, was solved by discarding the original grammar/domain theory, and that the quoted articles tend to contain the phrase grammar specialization---quite the opposite of the original term explanation-based generalization. Perhaps the best name for this technique would be data-driven search space reduction. Other people who worked on EBL for NLP include Guenther Neumann, Aravind Joshi, Srinivas Bangalore, and Khalil Sima'an.

Early life Alexander was born in Cradock, Eastern Cape, South Africa to David James Alexander, a carpenter, and Dimbiti Bisho Alexander, a schoolteacher. His maternal grandmother, Bisho Jarsa was an Ethiopian from ethnic Oromo, rescued from slavery by the British. He was educated at Holy Rosary Convent, Cradock, and matriculated in 1952. He spent six years at the University of Cape Town obtaining a BA in German and History (1955), completing his Honours in German a year later and an MA in German, his thesis was on the Silesia Baroque drama of Andreas Gryphius and Daniel Caspar von Lohenstein. Having been awarded an Alexander von Humboldt Foundation fellowship place at the University of Tübingen he gained his PhD in 1961 for a dissertation on style change in the dramatic work of Gerhart Hauptmann. The Apartheid years By 1957, Alexander was already radicalised and a member of the Cape Peninsula Students' Union, an affiliate of The Non-European Unity Movement of South Africa. He joined the African Peoples Democratic Union of Southern Africa (APDUSA) which was established in 1960. However he was ejected from APDUSA in 1961 and with Dulcie September, Ottilie Abrahams, and Andreas Shipinga, among others, formed a study group of nine members in July 1962, known as the Yu Chi Chan Club (YCCC); Yu Chi Chan is the Chinese name for guerrilla warfare, which Mao Zedong used. The YCCC disbanded in late 1962 and was replaced by the National Liberation Front (NLF), which Alexander co-founded. In July 1963, he, along with most members of the NLF, was arrested. In 1964, he was convicted of conspiracy to commit sabotage. From 1964–1974 he was imprisoned on Robben Island. Post-Apartheid After being released Alexander did pioneering work in the field of language policy and planning in South Africa from the early 1980s via organisations such as The Project for the Study of Alternative Education in South Africa (PRAESA), as well as the LANGTAG process. He was influential in respect to language policy development with various government departments, including Education. His most recent work was focused on the tension between multilingualism and the hegemony of English in the public sphere. He founded and was director of PRAESA from 1992 until the end of 2011 and a member of the Interim Governing Board of the African Academy of Languages. In 1981, he was appointed Director of the South African Committee for Higher Education (SACHED). At the time of his death, he had retired from being director of PRAESA at the University of Cape Town. In 1994, his Trotskyist Workers Organisation for Socialist Action contested the elections. Alexander received the Linguapax Prize for 2008. The prize is awarded annually (since 2000) in recognition of contributions to linguistic diversity and multilingual education. The citation noted that he had devoted more than twenty years of his professional life to defend and preserve multilingualism in the post-apartheid South Africa and had become one of the major advocates of linguistic diversity. Death Alexander died from cancer following a short period of ill-health on 27 August 2012, aged 75. His personal archive was donated to the University of Cape Town's Special Collections library. In 2014, the Neville Alexander Papers were included in the library's Manuscripts and Archives collections. The university has also named a building on its upper campus after him.

WorldCat. Retrieved 2012-09-10.  Plot introduction  The Changeover is set in a fairly new suburb of Christchurch called Gardendale; Mahy had renamed the suburb of Bishopdale for her book. It has a fairy-tale plot, with a devoted sister risking her life to save her bewitched brother. In some respects a coming-of-age story, it is also an unconventional romance between an aloof and difficult boy who happens to be a male witch and a strong-willed, psychically sensitive schoolgirl.  Plot summary  Laura Chant has one of her \\"warnings\\", a premonition that something is about to happen, but is forced to ignore it and go to school as usual. On the way home, she and her younger brother Jacko encounter the sinister Carmody Braque, who 'playfully' stamps Jacko's hand, the stamp appearing as an image of his face. As Jacko becomes increasingly ill, Laura believes he has been possessed. She seeks the help of Sorensen \\"Sorry\\" Carlisle, recognized by her as a witch in hiding though to others he seems just a painfully well-behaved school prefect who photographs birds as a hobby. She learns that Braque is an ancient being who consumes the life force of others to keep himself alive. Sorry's grandmother Winter, one of a long line of witches, recommends that Laura should \\"changeover\\" from her normal life, to become a witch or \\"woman of the moon\\" herself. She would then be in a position to trick an unwary Braque into putting himself in her power. Although warned that the changeover can be dangerous, Laura is determined to save her brother, now very near death. Laura experiences the changeover as a spirit journey through a dark forest, which is also at the same time Gardendale. The Carlisle witches help her through it, for their own reasons, and she emerges from the perilous passage with the power of nature and imagination awakened in her. Taking Sorensen along to mask her new power, Laura confronts Braque and succeeds in gaining power over him and breaking his hold on Jacko. At first intending to make the evil entity suffer, she rejects the dark temptation and instead ends his unnatural existence.

It is set in a humorous and still gruesome fantasy setting, and follows the lives of a party of goblin adventurers who started as monsters and declared themselves player characters. The tagline for the comic - \\"Life Through Their Eyes\\" - reflects the predominant theme of the comic: telling a heroic tale of creatures normally viewed only as evil and weak. Ellipsis Stephens cautions young readers about the comic, as it often contains scenes of strong violence. It won the Canadian Prix Aurora Award for \\"Best Graphic Novel\\" in 2011 and 2012. Background The comic debuted on June 26, 2005,The Webcomic List and updates presently occur at the rate of approximately 1-2 pages per month. The strip originally began in black and white, before converting to color in the thirtieth strip. The comic often employs humor related to metagaming in Dungeons & Dragons, such as a cleric praying to the all-powerful but nerdy Dungeon Master or characters arguing about whether or not they were subject to a random encounter. As the strip has progressed, the tone has become bleaker and the humor aspects have become less central than they were in early strips, although still present. In August 2006, Goblins joined Keenspot. In September 2006 it won Dragon Con's \\"Most Outstanding New Webcartoonist\\" award. A first bound volume of the webcomic is in print in North Americahttp://www.goblinscomic.com/Book1.html and Europe, and contains a foreword by Dungeons and Dragons game designer Monte Cook. A second volume was released in 2009. In August 2008, Ellipsis began a webcam channel to broadcast her drawing, first on JustinTV http://www.justin.tv/thunt and currently on Twitch. In October 2008, she made Goblins her full-time occupation. On August 10, 2010, Ellipsis left Keenspot and moved the comic to Blindferret, which also hosts Least I could do, Looking for Group, PvP and Ctrl+Alt+Del.http://www.goblinscomic.com In July 2011, Stephens switched from an ink and paper webcam approach to a digital format, using a Wacom Cintiq drawing tablet.

Character Class: All (\\"one-eleventh\\" of each) Plot  Book 1 Most of the characters and parties are all introduced. Minmax and Forgath are in league with The Drow Party, and they attack The Goblin War Camp. Chief, Big-ears, Thaco, Complains-of-Names and Fumbles must fight to protect their fellow warriors and a poorly locked treasure chest. Book 2 The Goblin Adventuring Party (GAP) is officially formed. Before returning to their village, the GAP intend to adventure and gain experience so that they can better protect their people. But on their way, Fumbles makes a tragic mistake, and his rash attempt to fix it leads GAP to Brassmoon City, the last place on earth any monster wants to be. Meanwhile, the powerful Dwarf paladin, Kore, whose only aim is to eliminate monsters, has his crossbow set on GAP's village. Dies Horribly meets and is enslaved by The White Terror, whose excavation of a valuable artifact draws a Hobgoblin attack. New friends are found and old enemies cross. Book 3 As GAP invades Brassmoon City, Captain Dellyn Goblinslayer believes an entire army of goblins is about to attack. When he announces a captured goblin is to be publicly executed in the town square, GAP is forced to take drastic action. Thaco confronts his nemesis. The White Terror gets closer to her goal, and Dies Horribly must venture with a specially selected team into a dungeon crawl. Some new alliances are born, while old ones are cut short by death. The Brassmoon City arc comes to a conclusion by the end of the book. Book 4 In the dungeon crawl, Well of Darkness, Dies Horribly's team discover and struggle with their ability to handle danger. The artificial arm Klik gave Dies makes some disturbing development. In Brassmoon City which has been left crippled after the incident with the goblins, Forgath and Minmax arrive looking for a ranger to help them track down GAP. Their recruiting effort does not go as planned. Meanwhile, together again and already at Level 4, GAP continue their journey home, but the dwarven paladin Kore intercepts. Great loss is suffered and The Blue Orb of Bloodlight arc comes to an epic conclusion at the end of this book. Book 5 After the climax of Book 4, the ex-Drow team is back, only to be slaughtered by a powerful, newborn force of evil. Meanwhile, Minmax, Forgath and Kin traverse the pocket-dimension dungeon crawl, The Maze of Many. The trio is locked in a deadly race against over two hundred alternate versions of themselves, ultimately confronting a Psion alternate of Minmax who is sabotaging the Maze. After defeating him, Minmax and Forgath teleport back to their home world to do a long-awaited battle with GAP. However the two teams must unexpectedly side with each other to deal with Kore. Tempts Fate and financial controversy In order to encourage donations, Ellipsis created a side comic featuring a goblin character named Tempts Fate, who is not connected with the main story.All Tempts Fate Stories At the beginning of each donation drive, Tempts Fate is faced with a series of obstacles and dangers; whether or not he survives, and how skillfully he does so, directly correlates with how much money the donation drive makes. Were the donation goal not met, Ellipsis has promised Tempts Fate will perish, never to be brought back again. Tempts Fate 11 has been implied to be the character's last and most expensive adventure, netting Ellipsis $37,151.67. Donation fees in this adventure were abnormally high and Ellipsis used all the money raised to help purchase a house. After over three years Ellipsis has yet to complete the page the donations were raised for. In 2008, Ellipsis started a donation drive to create an interactive game with Tempts Fate. This was called Tempts Fate 9. Fans could create their own goblin character and she would help each one through an adventure that would be a mass co-operative experience. Afterwards, she decided to postpone the idea until it could be re-launched as a self- contained game. This job of doing this was given to a programmer. Programmer talking about what happened This decision to postpone and retool the game was made after the donation drive started. The money gained was not refunded. Instead, it was rolled over into Tempts Fate 8.5.A discussion on the creation and shelving of Tempts Fate Game. By the time that the program needed to play the self contained Tempts Fate 9 game were completed, Ellipsis was no longer interested in running it, so the game was quietly canceled without an official announcement. Eventually, a new Tempts Fate 9 game was created, and all references to the original version were deleted from the website. A fan comic, made by the user name of Worst Case, was created after being inspired by the original Tempts Fate 9 donation game. Link to fancomic There is also a sequel to this on her photobucket account. Link to second fancomic In July 2013 a further donation drive was funded through Kickstarter raising an additional $177,850 towards the game. As of December 2014, after numerous revisions of the game, Ellipsis claimed that Evertide Games \\"has run away with all the money\\". In June 2015, Ellipsis made several allusions on her forums that a further donation drive may be necessary to attempt recovery of funds from Evertide Games. This game has been removed from Kickstarter. Kickstarter Page showing the removal of G:AR To date, Tempts Fate has survived eleven donation drives. On October 17, 2019, Ellipsis had an additional fundraiser to help cover costs of her transition to female. Instead of using a Tempts Fate donation drive, she opted to use Go Fund Me. After raising over $21,000 ($6,000 above the original goal), and having the surgery done, she deleted all mentions of the donation drive on her blog. As of May, 2020, her Go Fund Me is still accepting donations. Link to this is not available due to it being blacklisted by wikipedia, but the title of the drive is \\"Elli's Transition Surgery\\".

There were numerous illustrations to these, but they consisted of monochrome photographs attributed to Edward Connold. Locust myth Step created a myth of a mouse-eating grasshopper in his book 'Marvels of Insect Life (1915), where he wrote, \\"In the British Museum (Natural History) there is a specimen of one of the largest known locusts, which was received from a missionary in the Congo Free State a few years ago, who had taken it in the act of feasting upon a mouse it had caught.... The locust in question does not confine its attention to mice; large spiders, beetles and other insects, and probably small nestling birds serve it equally for food.\\" In fact no grasshopper is known to feed on mice.

The shock had a Richter magnitude of 7.1 and resulted in 12,225 fatalities. Qazvin Province lies in an area of Iran that experiences large earthquakes. The 1962 event originated on one of many faults in the area, called the Ipak Fault. Believed to have been reactivated multiple times, the fault is extensive and could still pose a threat to locals. Iran's building codes, renowned for performing poorly during earthquakes, were recently evaluated by multiple world organizations. Most hope that the Iranian government will implement a better quality of design, highlighting that Iran is among the most seismically active countries in the world.  Geology  Iran is a seismically active zone, lying between the converging Eurasian and Arabian Plates. Because it has both strike-slip and reverse faults, earthquakes often proceed so that if one fault is overwhelmed by movement, the movement will branch off to another fault, creating a separate earthquake.Berberian, Manuel, and Yeats, Robert S, pp. 120–139. Buin Zahra County lies within a zone of active thrust faults, complemented by folds, that extends south from the Alborz mountains. Despite the presence of faults, Qazvin Province does not regularly experience earthquakes. However, the space between earthquakes allows pressure to build up on faults, increasing the power – and magnitude – of the earthquakes. Specifically, the 1962 event originated on the Ipak Fault of northern Iran, along which it and aftershocks cut roughly of west-northwest trending surface faulting. A feature that extends for with its connected, smaller faults, the fault runs from the village of Ipak to Takhrijin. Iranian geologist Manuel Berberian's research indicates that the Ipak Fault is at least as old as the Carboniferous period, and has probably been reactivated several times since its formation. On the fault's south side, Carboniferous material is visible; this debris is not evident on the north side, which suggests that the fault was acting as a \\"dividing fault\\" while the area around it underwent sedimentation. Berberian could find no trace of Upper Guadalopian or Julfian sediments north of the fault. Another possible reason for this anomaly could be erosion; uplift could have exposed the northern portion of the fault but not the south.  Damage and casualties  Dutch people 12,225 fatalities resulted from the earthquake. An additional 2,776 people were injured, along with 21,310 houses either destroyed or too damaged to repair. 35 percent of domestic livestock was also killed, and several landslides and rock falls followed the rupture. 21,000 houses were destroyed, mainly because they were made up of mud and brick. Over 7,500 were buried in 31 individual villages, followed by reports from 60 additional villages. In these villages, however, 26,618 survived. One hospital in Tehran was \\"packed\\" with over 2,500 victims. Slight damage was experienced in Tehran, the nation's capital. Cities as far away as Tabriz, Esfahan and Yazd reported the tremor. Sandblows also formed along the rupture zone. The earthquake was also declared the largest rupture in the region since approximately 1630. Multiple reports came from the Rudak area of earthquake lights.  Relief efforts  Gholamreza Takhti and students organized relief efforts. Rescue operators suggested that an aerial and on-land search should be initiated to help victims. Officials expressed worries that people had gone for over a week with no aid. Iranian wrestling star Gholamreza Takhti gathered blankets, money, and food for victims and transported them by trucks. Because government response was slow, students at the University of Tehran took matters into their own hands. After gathering supplies, the students organized an effort to dispatch medical students and interns to the site of the disaster. Their teams were however blocked by Iranian National Guard members who had been commanded to kill any civilians who tried to help victims; writer Marcello di Cintio cites in Poets and Pahlevans: A Journey into the Heart of Iran that the \\"Shah was not about to let a crowd of students draw attention to his inept relief efforts\\".  Future threats  Since roughly 90 percent of Iran lies within seismically active land, the threat from earthquakes is high. In 2002, an earthquake in Buin Zahra killed more than 250 people and left roughly 25,000 without homes. In addition to its geological threat, Iran has poor earthquake engineering. In a 2004 report by ScienceDaily, it was listed as \\"the worst offender\\" globally for poor earthquake engineering. Professor Roger Bilham of the University of Colorado at Boulder, a geophysicist who specializes in earthquake-related deformation and hazards, blames construction practices for the fact that since the start of the 20th century, 1 in 3,000 Iranians has died in an earthquake-related incident. Bilham adds, \\"Most of Iran needs rebuilding. If the population of Iran had a choice between spending oil revenues on munitions or houses that won't kill them, I suspect they would choose a safe home. It's all a matter of earthquake education.\\" A Common Country Assessment by The United Nations for Iran has similar results, stating that, \\"While adequate building regulations exist for large cities, it is generally believed that they are not rigorously adhered to... most of those who have suffered in recent major earthquakes have lived in small towns and villages. Earthquake-proof construction is very rare in those areas and adequate building regulations are not yet in place\\".

Located in George Town, Grand Cayman, the structure stands on the corner of Harbour Drive and Fort Street. Although in present-day there is very little remaining of the original structure, its remains have been donated to the National Trust for the Cayman Islands in perpetuity. Fort George was one of the first fortifications built on the Cayman Islands during the early colonial period. Construction and dimensions In 1662, the then Governor of Jamaica, Lord Windsor, received royal instructions to protect the \\"Caimanes Islands ... by planting and raising Fortifications upon them\\"; the fortification, however, was not constructed until 1790. Fort George was built using local coral rock and limestone ironshore with its design being based largely on the English fortifications of the time. The oval base of the Fort measured approximately 57 feet by 38 feet. There were eight embrasures for cannons around the sides of the fort and a mahogany gate on the fort's landward side. The walls of Fort George ranged in thickness from two feet on its landward side to five feet on its seaward side, with the walls being about five feet in height. In 1802, when Edward Corbet came to Grand Cayman to compile a report for the Governor of Jamaica, he found the Fort \\"by no means well equipped\\" with only \\"three guns, four to six pounders\\", rather than the eight required by the original scheme. Fort George in the 20th century By the beginning of the 20th century, the fort was no longer in use. During World War II, a tall silk cotton tree growing within the fort was used as a lookout post. Members of the Home Guard, whose barracks were located next to the fort at Dobson Hall, would climb up into the tree's branches to watch for German submarines, many of which patrolled Caribbean waters hunting for merchant ships setting out to cross the Atlantic with supplies bound for English ports. In 1972, the Cayman Islands Planning Authority and a local developer were embroiled in a disagreement over the fort's future. The developer started the demolition of the structure, however, because of the objections raised by the local public, destruction of the site was halted. What remained of the structure was donated to the National Trust for the Cayman Islands in 1987.

F. Salahuddin Ahmed (24 September 1924 – 19 October 2014) was a Bangladeshi historian, humanist and rationalist thinker.  Early life and education  Ahmed was born in Motihari, Bihar. He came from a Bengali Muslim family. His father Abu Ahmed Faizul Mohi, paternal grandfather Moulvi Ahmed, one of the early Bengali Muslim high-ranking administrators in British India, and maternal grandfather Azizul Haque, (who is credited with having a major contribution to the development of Henry Classification System of fingerprint method) were all students of Presidency College, Calcutta. He received his I.A. from Surendranath College, (formerly Ripon College), and B.A. (Hons.) in history from Presidency College (now Presidency University). He completed his first M.A. in history from Calcutta University, and then a second M.A. in history from University of Pennsylvania, and his PhD in history from the School of Oriental and African Studies at University of London (1961). Professional career Ahmed started his teaching career in 1948 as a lecturer at Jagannath College, Dhaka. Later, he was a lecturer, reader, and then professor of history at Rajshahi University. He was also a professor of history at Jahangir Nagar University and Dhaka University, the job from which he retired in 1984. In 1963, Ahmed was invited by the American Historical Association as a visiting lecturer in South Asian history at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Chicago. He was also UNESCO Cultural Fellow at Kyoto University, Japan in 1956. Ahmed was also associated with Independent University, Bangladesh as Professor of National Culture and Heritage, and served as the president of the National Association of Social Sciences of Bangladesh, and chairman of the United Nations Association of Bangladesh. Personal life Ahmed married Hamida Khanom, who was one of the very few early Muslim graduates (I.A. and B.A.) from Bethune College, Calcutta. She completed her M.A. from Calcutta University, and then a second B.A. (Hons.) from University College London. She retired as Principal of Home Economics College, Dhaka. Hamida provided support and inspiration to Ahmed in his professional career throughout their long 60 years of married life. Publications The following quote from the review of one of Ahmed's book: Perspectives on History, Society and Politics published by Readers Service, Kolkata, 2001, aptly captures his views and reputation In 2012, Ahmed contributed a chapter, entitled \\"Bangladesh, Present, and Future Prospects\\" in a memorial book in honor of his younger deceased brother, Fakhruddin Ahmed, a career diplomat,and twice Foreign Secretary of Bangladesh, titled, Regional Cooperation and Globalization: Bangladesh, South Asia and Beyond edited by Dr. Zillur Rahman Khan and Dr. Meghna Guha Thakurta, where he makes a case for appreciating historical perspectives of social and political events: In 2004, Ahmed in collaboration with Bazlul Momin Choudhury, published a comprehensive editorial volume on the history of Bangladesh, entitled Bangladesh:National Culture and Heritage: An Introductory Reader, which gives an overview of the land, society, culture and religions, and history of the peoples of Bangladesh. Some other notable books in English and Bengali written by Ahmed are: * Social ideas and social change in Bengal 1818-18-35 * Bangladesh Tradition and Transformation,Bengali Nationalism and the Emergence of Bangladesh * Itihash O oitijjo Bangalir Sadhana O Bhangalir Muktijuddha * Bangladesh Jatiyabad, Swadhinata, Gonotantro He has also contributed many articles in professional journals. Social activities Ahmed's interest and involvement in social service is reflected by his work for the Red Cross during the turbulent period of Partition of India, and his association with the Radical Democratic Party founded by M.N.Roy, and his active involvement in Ahmed Memorial Foundation established by family members dedicated to the educational and social welfare of their ancestral village of Bashbaria in Faridpur, Bangladesh. He maintained an active life until the day he died, serving as the National Professor, writing and publishing articles, giving media interviews. He maintained worldwide contacts with his students, and professional acquaintances, as well as with their children and grandchildren, as many of them continued to seek him out for advise and support, as did his own family, and his house served as intellectual, social, and family gathering place during his lifetime.

The United States Navy purchased Yorktown on April 21, 1898, to be commissioned as the second USS Resolute, an auxiliary cruiser and transport that saw naval service during the Spanish–American War 1898–1899. The United States Department of War acquired the ship on January 22, 1900, for service as the United States Army Transport (USAT) Rawlings. The ship was sold to the Merchants and Miners Transportation Company of Baltimore, Maryland on July 27, 1901, and renamed Powhatan. Powhatan was wrecked in 1916 and in 1919 rebuilt as the world's first turbo-electric propelled passenger ship Cuba for luxury passenger and express freight service between Florida and Cuba with the Miami Steamship Company beginning service in 1920. Renamed Seneca, the ship burned and sank December 30, 1927, at Hoboken, New Jersey then refloated September 2, 1928, and scrapped. Over the ship's career she went aground at Santiago, Cuba, then two months later burned and sank at Brooklyn in 1901, collided and sank in 1916 in Chesapeake Bay and finally burned and sank in Hoboken, in 1927. Construction Yorktown, an iron-hulled passenger ship, was launched on February 10, 1894, by Delaware River Shipbuilding and Engine Works at Chester, Pennsylvania for the Old Dominion Steamship Company. Yorktown was the last ship on order, and when completed the company warned it would be forced to close for the first time in its history unless new orders were placed, putting the 100 men, down from 1,500 a few years before, out of work with depressive impact on the town of Chester. Old Dominion Steamship Company service, 1894–1898 The company served ports in the Chesapeake Bay with weekday, overnight freight and passenger service between New York, pier 26, North River, and Norfolk (Old Point Comfort) with routes extending to Richmond, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. Service by Yorktown and sister ship Jamestown was planned to begin April 10, 1894. On March 19, 1898, Yorktown was advertised by the company as the most comfortable way to travel from New York, sailing at 3 p.m. on March 22 and arriving the next morning for a $13 fare that included berth and meals, to see the \\"Launching of the Great Twin Battleships and \\" on March 24, 1898, at Newport News. United States government service, 1898–1902 The U.S. Navy purchased Yorktown from the Old Dominion Steamship Company on April 21, 1898, for Spanish–American War service commissioning the ship as USS Resolute on May 11, 1898, with Commander Joseph G. Eaton in command. United States Navy service, 1898–1899 Resolute departed New York City on May 25, 1898, assigned to cruise between Môle-Saint- Nicolas, Haiti, and Santiago de Cuba, Cuba, in search of the Spanish Navy squadron commanded by Admiral Pascual Cervera y Topete. After calling at Key West, Florida, on June 8, Resolute returned to the southeast Cuban coast to assist the U.S. fleet in scouting, relying on her high speed for protection. She was present on July 3 at the Battle of Santiago de Cuba, steaming eastward to warn United States Army transports of the Spanish squadrons emergence from the harbor of Santiago de Cuba. Subsequently, Resolute transported Spanish prisoners-of-war to the United States, departing the Cuban coast on July 8 for Charleston, South Carolina; Newport News, Virginia; Tompkinsville, New York; and New York City. Resolute returned to the Cuban war zone late in July engaging Spanish shore batteries at Manzanillo, Cuba, on August 13, but sailed for the United States carrying returning Marines from the First Battalion who had made the first assault landing at Guantánamo Bay. The ship reached New York on August 23 and after inspection continued to Portsmouth Harbor the next day, where the First Marine Battalion was disembarked. In October, Resolute embarked the Evacuation Commission at Nuevitas, Cuba, for transportation to Havana, Cuba, and Key West, and again to Havana. Then she returned American troops home to the U.S. Portsmouth, New Hampshire, probably while serving as a marker ship for the sea trials of the new battleship in May–September 1899.The suggestion at the U.S. Naval Historical Center Online Library of Selected Images that the photo possibly shows Resolute in July 1898 while transporting Spanish prisoners-of-war captured during the Spanish–American War does not appear possible, as the ship operated off Portsmouth only during the Kearsarge trials of 1899. Resolute was out of service until December, while being fumigated following an outbreak of yellow fever on board. She then steamed between Havana and Key West on transport missions through March 1899. Her final service was as a marker vessel for the steam trials of the new battleship at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, from May–September 1899. The ship arrived at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on October 2 for decommissioning effective on December 15, 1899, at League Island Navy Yard. United States Army service, 1900–1902 Resolute was transferred to the United States Department of War on January 22, 1900, for service with the Army Transport Service as the United States Army Transport (USAT) Rawlins. The ship was aground on a coral reef at Santiago, Cuba when on the way to embark the troops of the Tenth United States Infantry destined for New York. Then, on April 10, 1901, Rawlins was to have sailed from New York to Havana, Cuba with miscellaneous cargo, largely horse feed, but caught fire in the engine room with the result of a two alarm fire bringing six engines, two trucks and three fireboats and so much water pumped aboard by 9:30 a.m. that she rolled over, flooded and sank with deck awash at the Army's pier at Pacific Street, Brooklyn. There was no loss of life but four men were overcome by smoke and damage was estimated at $20,000 to refloat and $50,000 to repair. Rawlins was sold to the Merchants and Miners Transportation Company of Baltimore, Maryland on July 27, 1901, for $200,000. Later career, 1902–1928 The ship was returned to mercantile service in 1902 and operated under the names SS Powhatan, SS Cuba, and SS Seneca. Powatan Renamed Powatan the ship began Norfolk, Virginia—Boston, Massachusetts service with the Merchants and Miners Transportation Company. The company is shown in a 1908 railway guide with twenty-four ships and routes extending from Boston to Savannah, Georgia. At about 8:14 p.m. December 15, 1916, outbound Powatan collided with the inbound British ship southeast of Thimble Shoal Light in the deep channel of the lower Chesapeake Bay.Dates of December 8 and 13 were found in other references; however, presumption is that a formal court record would have the most accurate date of such an incident. Both ships were damaged with Powatan beached with ship and cargo a total loss. Court findings were that Powatan, in confused signals, had cut across Telenas course rather than pass port to port with the responsibility for the collision resting entirely with Powatan. On appeal of that decision the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the case and found it \\"unnecessary to add anything to the full and fair discussion\\" of the case in the lower court. SS Powhatan shortly after being brought to the surface. Powhatan was declared a total loss by both owners and underwriters and remained unsalvaged for months until World War I demands for shipping and skyrocketing ship values resulted in the hulk being raised and taken into Norfolk, Virginia until a rehabilitation plan was established. Powatan, described as \\"rusted, wasted hulk of a ship\\" that \\"shipping men\\" described as \\"the most hopeless\\" after two years on mud flats, was \\"yanked\\" off the mud and towed to New York by Morse tugs escorted as far as Barnegat, New Jersey by osprey with two eggs in a nest in the masthead lamp.The photo of the hulk in this reference shows the vessel stripped of all superstructure and deck houses with a stream of water being ejected from the port side. At the Morse Dry Dock and Repair Company Brooklyn yard damaged and corroded plates and frames were removed along with all machinery and there \\"was scarcely a whole shell\\" by the time the rebuild that converted the ship into the world's first electric drive passenger ship, SS Cuba, began. Cuba—world's first electric drive passenger ship December 4, 1920, advertisement in New York Evening Post. The rebuilt Powhatan, renamed Cuba, underwent trials and began operation in late 1920 as the world's first passenger ship with turbo-electric drive and all lighting and auxiliary machinery also being electric. On trials with the propulsion motor delivering full 3,000 horsepower, the ship attained a speed of 17.28 knots. Cuba was a relatively small ship of 3,580 tons displacement at draft, length overall and was not intended by the owners, Miami Steamship Company, to carry any cargo other than automobiles on deck, express freight and some refrigerated fruit with emphasis put of passenger accommodations and spaces—so that Cuba could \\"well be called a luxurious yacht rather than a passenger steamship\\". The rebuilding into Cuba was sponsored by Charles L. Dimon, grandson of John Dimon, partner in the firm Smith & Dimon that had designed and built 1845 clipper and the 1846 clipper , backed by the General Electric Company which Dimon had selected to furnish electrical equipment including the main propulsion. Initial references are for first-class-only service between to Florida ports and Havana, Cuba but later advertisements are for \\"New York direct to Miami\\" service leaving New York every Saturday. =Accommodations= Verandah Café. Passenger staterooms, with double berths and private baths, were in the forward superstructure with the dining room furnished with tables seating four. To aid in handling passenger's automobiles the vessel's side auto port was designed to allow the largest limousines then built to be driven, rather than hoisted, aboard. Among the passenger spaces were a card room on the boat deck aft of the officer's quarters and radio room; a smoking room with a large mahogany bar and end-to-end skylight aft of the card room and the Verandah Café aft of the smoking room. The Verandah Café was designed to imitate a typical verandah with running vines and trellis work, furniture in ivory and green and large windows opening to the sea breeze. =Engineering= 3,000-horsepower, 1,150-volt, 1,180-ampere electric propulsion motor installed in Cuba. Electric power was provided by a steam plant of four Scotch boilers, each with three oil-fired furnaces, driving a General Electric eight-stage turbo-generator set which in turn provided power at 1,100 volts, 1,234 amperes rated at 2,350 kilowatts delivering 50-cycle alternating current to the General Electric synchronous- type electric motor with a rated 3,000 horsepower running at 1,150 volts and 1,180 amperes driving the shaft and , four-bladed propeller with pitch of of the built-up type with cast-iron hub and manganese bronze blades. Motor control was by two levers, one for motor speed and another for forward or reverse. Two 150-kilowatt General Electric turbo-generator sets provided lighting and power for auxiliary machinery with a half-kilowatt Holtzer-Cabot Electric Company generator providing power for wireless communication with an emergency lighting generator set driven by a gasoline engine on the upper deck. Capstans and winches were all-electric, including the windlass for the two bower anchors of each. Steering gear, not electric, was steam driven, as were various engineering pumps; main boiler feed pump, auxiliary feed, circulating and air pumps. Two eight ton refrigeration plants were installed forward. Seneca On December 30, 1927, Seneca burned and sank at Hoboken, New Jersey. She was refloated on September 2, 1928, and subsequently scrapped.

The term was applied by later editors to the original two sonatas as Handel wrote them, and was also expanded to encompass several other sonatas for various instruments included in the Handel autograph manuscripts held by the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. History The two sonatas used by Dart for his edition were probably written between 1724 and 1726,Terence Best, \\"Handel's Chamber Music\\", Early Music 13, no. 4 (November 1985): 476–99. The citations are on p. 479 and in the table on p. 485. but were not likely intended to be associated, either as a pair or together with the other four recorder sonatas by Handel. They were first associated in 1948, when Thurston Dart named them after the Fitzwilliam Museum at the University of Cambridge, where the autograph sources are kept.George Buelow, A History of Baroque Music, sixth edition (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2004): 622 \\"Notes to pages 489-498\\" (accessdate = 21 February 2009). . Said autographs were part of the bequest that founded the museum, made in 1816 by Richard FitzWilliam, 7th Viscount FitzWilliamIan Chilvers, \\"Fitzwilliam Museum\\", in The Oxford Dictionary of Art, 3rd edition (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2004), . (not related to the Earls Fitzwilliam), who had bought them at auction following the death of J.C. Smith the Younger (1712–95), from the portion of his collection remaining after a major gift to King George III. In 1974 a new edition of three recorder sonatas under the same name was made by the German musicologist Klaus Hofmann.Georg Friedrich Händel, Fitzwilliam-Sonaten für Altblockflöte und Generalbaß, edited by Klaus Hofmann, 3 vols. (Neuhausen-Stuttgart: Hänssler- Verag, 1974). This edition restored the D minor sonata to its original seven- movement form, and added as no. 3 the Sonata in G Major, HWV 358, probably composed much earlier than the other two Fitzwilliam recorder sonatas, at some time between 1707 and 1710.Terence Best, \\"Handel's Chamber Music\\", Early Music 13, no. 4 (November 1985): 476–99. The citation is in the table on p. 485. Even with correction of an evidently defective, very high passage at the end of the third movement, Hofmann admits that \\"Handel must have been counting on a superlative instrumental soloist\\", and suggests that \\"perhaps an instrument in g' ought also to be kept in mind\\" (as opposed to the usual alto recorder in f').Georg Friedrich Händel, Fitzwilliam-Sonaten für Altblockflöte und Generalbaß, edited by Klaus Hofmann, vol. 3: Sonate G-dur (Neuhausen- Stuttgart: Hänssler-Verag, 1974), p. 2. The attribution of this sonata to the recorder is contested, however. Both David Lasocki and Terence Best assign it to the violin,David Lasocki, \\"New Light on Handel 's Woodwind Sonatas\\", American Recorder 21, no. 4 (February 1981): 169; Terence Best, \\"Critical Commentary\\", in G.

Ltd.; New York: G. Schirmer Inc.; Auckland: Roderick Biss Music Ltd., 1983), 50, although Best concedes that the extremely high notes at the end of the last movement which, in his opinion, rule out the recorder, \\"are difficult even for a modern player\\" of the violin, and \\"do not fit the bass comfortably: it is possible that Handel made a mistake in notation\\", as Hofmann contended. whereas Jean- Claude Veilhan endorses Hofmann's view,George Frideric Handel, Sonate en sol majeur pour flûte à bec alto et basse continue (Fitzwilliam MS 261), transcription Jean-Claude Veilhan, réalisation de la basse, Danièle Salzer (Paris: Alphonse Leduc, 1990). and Winfried Michel acknowledges the possibility.George Frideric Handel, Die Sonaten für Altblockflöte und B.c. , edited by Winfried Michel, 2nd edition (Münster: Mieroprint, 1992) is a facsimile edition including HWV 358, though in his transcribed edition, George Frideric Handel, Sonaten für Altblockflöte und Basso Continuo / Sonatas for Treble Recorder and Basso Continuo, edited by Winfried Michel, Camera Flauto Amadeus 122 (Winterthur: Amadeus Verlag/B.

The second movement was re-used in his Organ Concerto in F major, Op. 4, No. 4 (HWV 292). The third movement was used in the Violin Sonata, Op. 1, No. 3 (HWV 361). Modern scholars agree that the B major sonata must have been written for the recorder, despite there being no mention of this on the autograph.Martha Bixler, \\"A Handel Sonata Roundup: Editions, Then & Now\\", American Recorder 39, no. 5 (November 1998): 9–16; the cited passage is on p. 12. One of the reasons for this is that, \\"when Handel used the third movement again in his A major violin sonata, he changed the key to A major, which would seem to eliminate the possibility that the B major version is for the violin.\\"David Lasocki, \\"New Light on Handel 's Woodwind Sonatas\\", American Recorder 21, no. 4 (February 1981): 163–70; the cited passage is on p. 167. In addition, the key and range were unsuitable for the oboe, according to one source, though another writer claims that, although \\"the key would be suitable for the oboe, but less so for the flute,\\" nevertheless \\"The range is too high for the oboe, and all of Handel's genuine flute and oboe sonatas go significantly below f′ (flute sonatas to d′, oboe sonatas to c′ or d′)\\".David Lasocki, \\"New Light on Handel 's Woodwind Sonatas\\", American Recorder 21, no. 4 (February 1981): 163–70; the cited passage is on pp. 167–68. The second and third of Dart's sonatas were originally a single sonata (HWV 367a), and was broken into two parts by Thurston Dart in his edition of 1948. The sonata designated by Dart as No. 2 consists of movement 7 of this D minor sonata followed by an earlier version of movement 6 of the same work, concluding with an unrelated minuet by Handel, together with a double (variation) composed by Dart.Terence Best, \\"Handel's Chamber Music\\", Early Music 13, no. 4 (November 1985): 476–499, citation on 486.

It premiered in Dahan's native France on April 7, 2010 and in the United States at the Tribeca Film Festival between April 21 to May 2, 2010. The soundtrack contains music written by Bob Dylan, including Zellweger singing a cover of \\"Life Is Hard\\" from his 2009 album Together Through Life. Plot In Marysville, Kansas, a paralyzed former singer, Jane, argues with her stuttering friend Joey about his belief that he can talk to the invisible world. One day, during her physiotherapy treatment, he messes up her house while searching for a book about angels that he has lent her. He is taken by the police to a hospital, where an angry Jane visits. The following night, Joey escapes and comes back to Jane's house to clean up. He finds a letter from her young son inviting her to his communion in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where he lives with his adoptive family. Joey spends the night on the couch. In the morning, the police ask her if Joey is in her house, but he has already left. Joey begs Jane to go to New Orleans, where an author writing about angels is holding a conference. On the drive, the engine heats up and the car explodes. They buy a new car, but it is stolen. They board a coach and while Jane sleeps, Joey meets Billie by helping her find her wedding ring on the floor. She tells him her husband has disappeared without giving an address. The three dine at Billie's sister's house. The next morning, Joey, Jane and Billie are driven to a restaurant by a relative, but Jane forgets her purse in the car, so Joey elaborates a plan to get them to the bus without paying. The plan does not work but they eventually get into the bus, where they argue about what they've done. The bus driver abandons them in the middle of nowhere. Jane decides to go back home and Joey reveals her son's letter. At night, the three hear music and meet Caldwell, an old musician with whom they share some cake enhanced with drugs. The following day, Caldwell gives them a lift, as Jane agrees to replace a singer. Shortly before the show, Jane argues with Joey about his mothering her. She leaves the group and meets fellow travelers going to Iowa. The woman of the couple is ill and they are going there on their last trip to visit their children. This inspiring meeting persuades Jane to perform the show. She arrives on stage while Joey prays for her to come back. She sings \\"This Land Is Your Land\\" accompanied by Caldwell on electric guitar, to applause from the club. As they drive towards New Orleans, they notice their stolen car on the road and chase the thief. An accident ensues and everybody is arrested and subsequently freed except Caldwell, who is taken to prison. Jane gives him a song written for him, about the beauty of birds. In New Orleans, Joey attends the conference about angels, but discovers the author is a racist and a liar. He does not believe in what he writes and hates his Black and Mexican readership. Joey punches him in the face and the three travelers are expelled from the conference. They get to the train station and are bound to Baton Rouge when Billie receives a call. Her husband is on the phone and seems ready to come back home. She leaves Jane and Joey before their train departs. In Baton Rouge, as they reach Jane's son's communion, she is afraid that she will not recognize him seven years after her accident and subsequent coma. Joey tells her to sing, so that he will find her. She listens to his advice, and her son, who was about to leave, stops in front of her. The final scene is set later back in Kansas. Joey and Jane are sitting in front of a lake. Her son and his adoptive parents arrive for a visit. Jane and Joey hold hands as the three approach.

Its membership consists of both nonprofit women's organizations and individuals. About NYWA Founded in 1992 by Elinor Guggenheimer, NYWA is a nonprofit organization dedicated to bettering the lives of women and children of New York. NYWA's members represent the diversity of New York City and include community-based groups; religious, ethnic, and political groups; professional associations; and issues-based groups. Through NYWA, these groups unite to work on issues of common interest and to advocate for public policy. Agendas NYWA is involved in various activities which focus on a broad range of public policy issues that affect the quality of life of women and their families. These are grouped into three main areas, or \\"agendas\\" that are the focus of NYWA's work each year. * Governmental Affairs Agenda: Their most recent success was the Fair Pay Forum held at Hunter College in December 2008 featuring Lilly Ledbetter which stimulated passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009. \\"The legislation expanded workers’ rights to sue in this kind of case, and relaxed the statute of limitations, restarting the six-month clock every time the worker receives a paycheck.\\" \\"Times Topics\\" The New York Times. For the most current information, go to NYWA/EPCNYC BLOG: www.nywaepcnyc.org * Economic Security Agenda: Most recently, NYWA has developed the Strategic Business Leadership program with the School of Continuing and Professional Studies, New York University, Department of Leadership and Human Capital Management. This program is tailored specifically towards women leaders of profit and nonprofit organizations and government agencies who are looking to improve their leadership skills and increase their organization’s effectiveness. Participants in this program receive an Executive Certificate in Strategic Business Leadership. * Quality of Life Agenda: focuses on what may improve living conditions for New York women and their families, including affordability of housing, the physical environment, recreation, health, safety, culture, and the sense of community. Programs * Financial Literacy: Financial literacy was first addressed in 1998 when Muriel Siebert was NYWA president. Now, in conjunction with the Manhattan Chamber of Commerce NYWA created The New York City Financial Literacy Guide for Girls and Women. \\"Women are in a special need of becoming financially literate. Yet women often do not want to admit their problems in money management. This Guide provides numerous different resources including self-study possibilities as well as workshops, courses and events.\\" The Manhattan Chamber of Commerce. * New York Breaks the Silence Together: This program was begun by Linda Fairstein, former chief of the Manhattan District Attorney's sex crimes unit because, \\"We lose the victims before the trial...The victims withdraw, choose not to prosecute, some because of fear of reprisal, some because of the psychological feelings involved. The perception has been nationally...that these cases don't do well in the system\\" by George James, The New York Times, 12/6/95. *New York Reads Together: This is the first citywide book discussion project to foster literacy. Supported by the New York City school system and nationally known newscaster Roz Abrams, it is one of NYWA's most successful programs. At its 2005 commencement, Pace University President David A. Caputo honored Roz Abrams's work on this program, \\"You serve as cochair of the New York Reads Together Program, a program of New York’s Women’s Agenda that aims to foster citywide discussions based on people all reading the same book at the same time.\\" David A Caputo, Pace University.

His compositions included duets for Shadia and Abdel Halim Hafez. He played the leading roles in a few Egyptian films, the most famous being \\"Of the Good Day\\" (Naharak Sa'id).Film Database His father Ibrahim Zaki Mourad Mordechai was a famous Jewish Egyptian singer,elaph musician and composer in the early twentieth century, his mother was a Jewish Egyptian called Gamilah Ibrahim Roushou, the daughter of Ibrahim Roushou, a local concert contractor in the early 20th century who regularly booked Zaki Mourad to sing at concerts and wedding parties. Mourad was born in Cairo. When Mounir was growing up, his sister, the artist Leila Mourad was already famous and singing on Egyptian radio. In 1939, Mourad left his French college (Collège- des-Frères (Bab-El-Louk)) took various jobs, then entered the field of cinema, firstly as a script supervisor (Klaket), and then as an assistant director to Kamal Salim in about 24 films in the 1940s. Mourad attempted to compose and present jazz music that was popular at that time in the West, but faced difficulties in promoting it and to convince anyone to produce it. His big breakthrough, however, came when he composed his first popular song \\"One Two\\" (\\"Wahed .. Etneen\\") sung by Shadia which then opened the way for the singers and film-makers to entrust him to compose songs in many movies. Mourad was a pioneer in dance music and musical shows. He composed and developed much of Egypt's most famous dance music, performed by the leading dancers of the time, Tahiya Karioka, Samia Gamal, and Naima Akef. His association with singer Shadia was a milestone in the history of Egyptian music as their songs have become classic songs of romance in Egypt. In addition, songs for Abdel Halim Hafez served as a special aspect of the Halim experience. Mounir Mourad composed music for several other singers from Egypt and some Arab countries with the same method, which is characterised with successive rapid rhythm.

In their attempts to disband the crowd, officers tear gassed, hosed and finally fired their riot guns, leading to 50 injuries, but no deaths.Hilo Massacre . University of Hawaiʻi - West Oʻahu Center for Labor Education & Research. Accessed 21 February 2009. These protesters were from a number of ethnicities, including Chinese, Japanese, Native Hawaiian, Luso and Filipino Americans, and from many different unions, including the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union. The different groups, long at odds, put aside their differences to challenge the Inter-Island Steam Navigation Company. The unions, led by longshoreman Harry Kamoku, demanded equal wages with workers on the West Coast of the United States and closed shop or union shop. Strikes began on 4 February 1938, and culminated on 1 August when 200 workers gathered to protest the arrival of the SS Waialeale, a steamship owned by the Inter-Island Steam Navigation Company. The protesters were ordered to disband, but refused to comply. Force was used, resulting in hospitalizations. Background As part of the New Deal, Congress in 1935 passed the Wagner Act, legalizing workers' right to join and be represented by labor unions. Hawaii — not yet a State — had been, starting in the 1920s, virtually controlled by the \\"Big Five\\": Alexander & Baldwin, C. Brewer, Castle & Cooke, American Factors, and Theo. Davies. Furthermore, the Hawaii labor force had been divided up into racial blocs, which helped keep wages low. Harry Kamoku (1905–1957) was the primary organizer and leader of the first real union in Hawaii to be legally recognized. Kamoku was a Chinese-Hawaiian and a longshoreman, born in Hilo. On November 22, 1935 Kamoku and about 30 longshoremen of every ethnicity formed the Hilo Longshoremen's Association. This successful, and other unions were created or came into Hawaii from other states or countries, including the Inland Boatmen's Union (IBU), the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union (ILWU) and the Metal Trades Council (MTC). The strikes On 4 February 1938, strikes began. The strikers demanded equal wages with workers on the West Coast and closed shop or union shop. Strikes continued well into July and August. The SS Waialeale, owned by the Inter-Island Steamship Company, which in turn was owned by the Big Five, was due to come into port on 1 August. On that day, protesters from different unions arrived to protest the ship's docking. Witnesses estimated the crowd anywhere from 80 to 800, with the newspapers reports saying around 500 to 600. It is likely, however, that there were only around 200 protesters. The incident After the ship docked, the crowd advanced down the dock. The police had set up a \\"dead line\\" that the protesters were not supposed to cross. The protesters, however, crossed it. The police threw about a dozen tear gas grenades into the crowd. Among the protesters were members of the Hawaii Territorial Guard who took action and threw tear gas grenades back at the police or away from the crowd. They were also instrumental in providing the unions police plans on how the police were going to react to the strike. The tear gas did cause some protesters to leave and temporary confusion, but after regrouping, the crowd kept on advancing. Meanwhile, the police were getting ready to bring out fire truck hoses. The police sprayed the crowd with water. During this, the police made no attempt to make any arrests, being unsure whether or not they had jurisdiction. The protesters eventually regrouped. The protesters remained peaceful the vast majority of the time, sitting down and refusing to leave when confronted by police officers. Sheriff Henry K. Martin ordered the police officers to change out their ammunition from buckshot to birdshot to disperse the crowd without fatalities. Police warned the demonstrators they would fire on them if they did not disperse voluntarily; few heeded the warning. At 10:20 a.m., Lieutenant Charles Warren stabbed one of the protesters in the back with a bayonet. The police then opened fire for five minutes on the crowd with birdshot, and with buckshot from police officers who failed to hear the orders. At least 16 rounds of ammunition were fired, and at least 50 people were shot, including two women and two children. Aftermath Later that day, a larger crowd gathered to be addressed by Harry Kamoku. Estimates of the size of the crowd range from 500 to 3000 people. Kamoku said, \\"The only reason we know for them shooting at us like criminals is that we are members of our chosen unions. The order to shoot came while we were sitting down.\\" Joseph V. Hodgson (1899–1973) was appointed Attorney General of the territory by Governor Joseph Poindexter a few weeks before the Hilo Massacre. Hodgson later released the Hodgson Report, which reported on the Massacre. In October 1938, injured protester Kai Uratani filed a lawsuit against the officers responsible for the shooting. He lost, and instead had to pay for the officers' defense costs. Legacy Despite the injuries, the strike did not achieve any immediate major gains for the unions. However, within ten years, Hawaii unions had become very powerful, and the August 1 anniversary of the Hilo massacre was regularly commemorated at the Hilo docks.

The purpose of the fortress was to provide a secure naval base for the Russian Baltic fleet and to protect Helsinki and block routes to Saint Petersburg from a possible German invasion. Krepost Sveaborg was part of Peter the Great's Naval Fortress, a coastal fortification system protecting access to Saint Petersburg by sea. The central part of Krepost Sveaborg was the old fortress of Suomenlinna where the fortress headquarters were located. Due to technological advances in artillery the old fortress was no longer capable of providing a sufficient protection, and a new main defensive line was built well beyond the old fortress boundaries. New coastal artillery guns built on outlying islands protected Krepost Sveaborg from the sea, while fortified lines constructed around Helsinki were intended to stop any attacks on land. The primary coastal guns were model 1891 guns and model 1892 Canet guns. Older model 1877 guns were also used. In summer 1917 the fortress had two hundred coastal or anti-landing guns, of which 24 were 10-inch guns in six batteries, 16 were 6-inch Canet guns in four batteries and twelve were 11-inch guns in three batteries. The artillery used in land fortifications included older coastal guns, old fixed carriage guns and newer light field guns. In March 1917, Krepost Sveaborg had a total of 463 guns, although many of them were obsolescent. Krepost Sveaborg was still partly incomplete in 1917 when the February Revolution halted most of the construction work. Some further construction work was carried out during the remaining year, but all work halted during the October Revolution. Following the Finnish Declaration of Independence, parts of the land fortifications were used in the Finnish Civil War. The coastal fortifications were later taken over by Finland to protect Helsinki, while the land fortifications were mostly abandoned and disarmed. Background Sweden had ceded Grand Duchy of Finland to Russian Empire as the result of the Finnish War of 1808—1809 and along with it the fortress of Sveaborg, , the present day Suomenlinna. The fortress protected the southern Finland and became a naval base for the Russian Baltic Fleet. After the end of the Napoleonic Wars many new buildings were built to improve the living conditions on the fortress, but the fortifications were neglected. After the start of the Crimean War in 1853 construction of new fortifications began on the other nearby islands and on the southern shore of Helsinki peninsula. In 1854 an Anglo-French naval fleet entered the Baltic Sea, hastening the work. These fortifications protected the flanks of the fortress and provided depth to the defence, but the problem of obsolescent artillery was not solved. Thus when the fleet attacked the fortress on the 6th of August 1855 they were able to bombard the fortress for two days from a distance of while the best Russian guns had a maximum range of . After Crimean War fortifications of Viapori were improved by building artillery casemates and new bomb-proof buildings. Vallisaari just east of Suomenlinna was the site of the first new construction works. The harsh suppression of the Polish January Uprising of 1863 and the resulting criticism soured the relationships between Russia and western Europe and hastened the fortification works. Between 1863 and 1864 redoubts were built on Vallisaari, Kuninkaansaari and Santahamina islands. In 1860s and 1870s Russia purchased and then built under license new Prussian Krupp rifled breech loading guns which were also used in Viapori. A total of 32 new bomb- proof stone powder cellars were built by the beginning of the 1870s, further improving the defences. The Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878 was the next crisis that threatened the peace between Russia and England, with new batteries being built at Viapori on Kuninkaansaari and older ones improved or rebuilt. New technology in the form of telegraph, railway lines and searchlights began to be used. Improvements in artillery and ammunition forced improving the gun positions by covering the old walls and fortifications with a thick earthen walls. With high-explosive shells appearing at the end of the 19th century earth and stone were no longer sufficient and first concrete fortifications with steel doors were built in Viapori. Continually improving guns resulted increased range, necessitating rangefinders, while heavier guns and ammunition required improving piers, roads, cranes and ammunition carts to transport the guns or move ammunition from magazines to guns. Despite the improvements the funds and resources allocated to the fortress were not sufficient to keep pace with the evolution of military technology. While parts of the fortress or were improved and new weapons or equipment were received, the overall condition of the fortress became ever more obsolescent, and the vulnerability of the flanks and rear were a lasting problem. By the end of 1880s and early 1890s Viapori could no longer be considered a proper fortress but only a coastal position, capable of defending only against an enemy coming directly from the sea. The primary role of the fortress became more one of internal politics, as it helped the Russians maintain control of Helsinki. Krepost Sveaborg In the 1890s the priority of the fortification works in the Baltic Sea had been the protection of the ice-free port of Liepāja, and the Kronstadt fortress protecting Saint Petersburg, relegating Viapori to a secondary status. After the losses during the Russo-Japanese War and in light of the rising might of the Imperial German Navy, Liepāja was considered too vulnerable for a main fleet base, and the decision to build Peter the Great's Naval Fortress was made. In the new plans the main line of defence against the enemy was at the Porkkala-Tallinn line with Tallinn also the new main base for the Russian Baltic Fleet. Helsinki was to be a base for torpedo boat flotillas. The construction of the Tallinn naval base was delayed however, and with the new ships being constructed to replace the losses suffered against Japan the Russian Navy was forced to rely more on Helsinki despite the obsolete armament and inadequate fortifications at Viapori. As the threat of war in Europe grew, it became essential to expand the fortress to provide a necessary protection for the naval base. Until 1910, when the first 152 mm Canet guns arrived, the only modern weapons at Viapori were 57 mm quick fire guns with the rest of the artillery designs dating from the Russo-Turkish War. The first new 254 mm guns arrived in 1913, but it was not until early 1914 that construction of the first new batteries began on Melkki and Isosaari. During the First World War the new Krepost Sveaborg was built to substantially expand the old fortress. A new main line of defence was constructed on the outlying islands, pushing the defensive line several kilometers southward, thus providing a secure outer anchorage south of the old fortress for larger warships without the need to navigate the narrow straits leading to the inner anchorage at Kruunuvuorenselkä. The older parts of the fortress became a second line of defence and the main storage areas. The rear of the fortress was finally protected by land fortifications, at first field fortifications on the Helsinki peninsula built in 1914, and, later, an outer line of fixed fortifications. Troops and organization At the start of the First World War Krepost Sveaborg was subordinated to the Russian 6th Army. In summer 1916 Krepost Sveaborg was subordinated to Baltic Fleet. At the start of the war Krepost Sveaborg was divided into three defensive areas, with the sea front forming one defensive area and the land front divided to Pasila and Laajasalo- Herttoniemi areas. The sea front was further divided into six sectors, with sectors 1–4 at the old fortress, sector 5 at Melkki and sector 6 at Isosaari. The sea front was divided into main line of defence from Melkki to Isosaari and second line of defence from Lauttasaari to Santahamina at the end of 1914. As the new batteries were constructed Melkki was relegated to second line of defence and Lauttasaari to land front in spring 1915. At the land front new defensive lines were constructed from 1915 onward further away from the city center. The new land front was divided into three sectors: eastern, northern and western. Krepost Sveaborg was also responsible for a larger fortification district that included coast line west of the fortress until Hanko. At the start of the war the fortification artillery units manning the fortress were organized into nine artillery companies and a machine gun detachment. In April 1915 the fortification artillery units were reorganized into a single fortification artillery regiment with three battalions and a machine gun company. Four companies manned the coastal forts at sea front. In June 1916 the regiment was divided in two, with 1st regiment responsible for the seaward defence and the 2nd for the landward defence. Both regiments had ten companies in three battalions. The 1st regiment was divided into three defence detachments, with south-western and south-eastern detachments responsible for the main line of defence on the outlying islands with the newest guns, while the third detachment manned the second line on the old fortress. The artillery regiments had a common supply unit responsible for the weapons, ammunition, transportation between islands etc. A signals company built and maintained the communication lines. The minefields around the fortress were built by the Krepost Sveaborg mine company, from 1915 a mine battalion. In 1916 the fortress was reinforced by the mine battalion from Vladivostok fortress. Construction and engineering department of the fortress headquarters organized the construction works of the fortress with engineering and sapper units as well as the civilian workers. Infantry units at the fortress manned the landward defences and provided detachments on the coastal forts for anti- landing and close defence duties. The peacetime Krepost Sveaborg fortress infantry regiment was reinforced by conscript units, which in 1915 were organized as the 427th and 428th infantry regiments to a new 107th infantry division which was sent to front line after a training period. In spring 1916 regiments from the new 116th division manned the fortress. At the autumn of 1916 units from different fortresses were brought to Krepost Sveaborg and organized into the 128th infantry division. In July 1917 the fortress was manned by the fortress infantry regiment and the 428th Lodeynoye Pole infantry regiment of the 128th division. In October 1917 the 128th was replaced by the 29th infantry division, badly mauled at the front and brought to Krepost Sveaborg for rest. At January–February 1918, when Finland gained its independence, Krepost Sveaborg had six infantry regiments: the 696th revolutionary regiment, the fortress infantry regiment and 113th, 114th, 115th and 116th regiments of the 29th infantry division. Construction workers included Russian soldiers but also Finnish civilian workers and forced labour using prisoners transported from far east. Finns were exempt from conscription, and thus there was available manpower for fortification works. The payment for fortification works was slightly above average for manual labour, and made it an attractive option particularly for many rural workers. In 1915 when large scale construction of fortifications around Finland began Russians instituted a work responsibility for Finns based on wartime emergency law to obtain the necessary labour force. To ease the manpower shortage Russians brought convicted prisoners from far east to Finland in summer 1916 as forced labour. Approximately 2000-3000 men, including Chinese, Kyrgyz and Tatars, were employed as lumberjacks around Espoo and Sipoo. Kyrgyz were mainly guards. Asian workers were transported back to Russia already in 1917 however, citing the workers to be unaccustomed to the northern climate and possible threat of rebellion. The total number of workers in not known, but an estimated 10 000 to 15 000 men were used in construction works around Helsinki and up to 100 000 total in Finland. Complicated bureaucracy delayed the construction works, and the supervision of the works was also poor, leading to a widespread graft. Armament Coastal guns The most powerful coastal guns used at Krepost Sveaborg were the 45 caliber model 1891 guns. They had a maximum range of but suffered from primitive mountings: the heavy guns, weighing , were completely hand-operated resulting in slow traverse and elevation rates and exhausting the gun crews. The rate of fire was only one shot every two minutes and they were also not capable of penetrating the armour of newer warships: at the range of they could penetrate of armour at 90° angle. First four guns were transported to the fortress in 1913 from Kronstadt fortress, two guns each from Constantin and Obrutshev forts. Twelve guns were transported from Vladivostok in 1914 and eight more arrived in 1915, with a total of 24 guns in six four-gun batteries. These guns formed the primary armament of the sea front main line of defence. The batteries were located on Rysäkari, Katajaluoto, Kuivasaari, Isosaari (two batteries) and Itä-Villinki. The 45 caliber model 1892 guns supplemented the 10 inch guns of the sea front main line of defence. These guns were French Canet guns and had a maximum range of . Unlike the 10 inch guns, the 6 inch guns had a modern counter-recoil system and achieved a rate of fire of five shots per minute. The six inch guns were intended against destroyers and other smaller vessels. They were installed in four batteries of four guns each at the sea front on Miessaari, Harmaja, Isosaari and Santahamina. A fifth battery was under construction on the mainland at Skatanniemi cape. The guns for this battery arrived, bringing the total sea front number to twenty, but the construction was not completed before the war ended. Further seventeen guns on lower ship deck mountings with lower maximum elevation were used on the land front. The guns used at Krepost Sveaborg included both Russian Obukhov licence-produced guns and French Schneider guns. The older heavy coastal artillery pieces, the and model 1867 and 1877 guns and the and model 1877 coastal mortars, were mostly transferred to land front or placed in reserve. Three batteries (twelve guns) of 11 inch model 1877 guns were used throughout the war at the sea front second line of defence at Kustaanmiekka, Kuninkaansaari and Vallisaari. At the start of the war 11 inch guns were also used at the main line of defence on Isosaari before 10 inch model 1891 guns replaced them. Two batteries of 11 inch coastal mortars remained in use until 1916 in Vallisaari and Kuninkaansaari. The mortars were also capable of firing to the rear of the fortress and were intended to keep the citizens of Helsinki loyal. The heavy shells of the mortars were considered to have a \\"suitable moral effect\\" () on civilians. 22 caliber siege gun model 1877 was primarily an army weapon used on wheeled carriage on land front, but some guns mounted on fortification mounts were also used on sea front at the start of the war. Light coastal guns used at Krepost Sveaborg included 57 mm Nordenfelt guns, fifteen guns at the beginning of the war and twenty by the end of the war. 50 caliber model 1892 Canet guns were similar to the six inch model 1892 gun. First of these guns arrived at 1914, and twelve coastal guns were used at Krepost Sveaborg, with another eighth anti-aircraft gun versions with a 50° maximum elevation. It was planned in 1916 to build four two-gun batteries of 52 caliber model 1907 guns at Krepost Sveaborg, but the work started in 1917 never progressed beyond building gun mount foundations and some ammunition and crew shelters. The batteries were to be built on the mainland, with guns in single open positions capable of firing on both land and sea targets. The batteries were located at Munkkiniemi, Haaga, Oulunkylä and Koskela. The 305 mm guns were used later to protect Helsinki however, as Finland built an armoured twin turret on Kuivasaari between 1931 and 1935 and two guns in open positions at Isosaari during the Second World War in 1941–1944. { border=1 + Changes in coastal guns at Krepost Sveaborg - !

Gun models included both older fixed carriage guns and more modern weapons with counter-recoil systems. The most common models were the 6 inch siege gun model 1877 with a 190 pood version used on both field and fortress mounts and a lighter 120 pood barrel version on field carriage. 42 line () battery gun model 1877 and 34 line () light field gun model 1877 were other older field artillery pieces used at the fortress. 76 mm model 1902 gun was a newer rapid fire field gun with a counter recoil system. The 76 mm model 1902 gun was also used as an anti-aircraft gun on a modified \\"Rosenberg\\" mount. The land front weaponry also included a variety of smaller caliber anti-storming guns, caponier guns and other mixed artillery pieces. The reserve guns included different older models up to bronze-barrelled mortars. Mines Naval mines were also used to protect Krepost Sveaborg from an attack from the sea. An outer line of contact mines was laid approximately outside the main line of defence. Shore detonated controlled mines were used to create an inner mine barrier to protect the entrances to the outer anchorage. These mines were laid typically in three rows with separation between rows and between mines in a row. Controlled mines required an extensive cabling system to the shore stations where the command to detonate the mines was given. Fortified electrical stations provided the necessary electricity for the mine control network. Electricity was also used for communication systems, searchlights, electrical ammunition lifts and in barracks and crew shelters. Equipment Rangefinders Vertical based rangefinders, where the known base length is the height of the rangefinder from sea level, were first used at Viapori in the 1880s. Vertical based rangefinders required only one instrument, but they were susceptible to interference from vibration caused by firing of the guns. Vertical based rangefinders also required a substantially high measurement site that was a problem on the low islands. To measure distance with reasonable accuracy to a target away the rangefinder had to be at least 10 fathoms () and preferably 20 fathoms () high - often impossible to achieve. Measurement sites had usually the rangefinder on a stone or masonry column high lying on a granite foundation. The measurement pavilions had simple wooden walls and sheet metal roof protecting them from the elements and were in size. Vertical rangefinders were no longer used on the new forts built on the outer islands. Distance measurement at the model 1891 batteries was based on horizontal triangulation from two different points, a primary and secondary, on separate islands. The rangefinders used were general von der Launitz's models 1903 and 1905–07. The average distance between the two points at Krepost Sveaborg was . Target information was sent from the primary point to the battery command point. If the primary point was located away from the battery or directing a different battery a rangefinder converter designed by colonel Kovanko was used to calculate the firing solution. A weakness in using two measurement points was that any malfunctions in either of the rangefinders or in the telephone system would render the system inoperable. Target indication between the primary and secondary points could also pose problems, as there would often be several similar target ships. The system was also not capable of measuring distances to targets in the rear of the battery; a maximum measurement sector was 140°. On the smaller model 1892 Canet gun and anti-aircraft batteries wide Zeiss stereoscopic rangefinders were used. Maximum distance that could be reliably measured with three meter rangefinders was , while the maximum range of the six inch guns was . A single rangefinder was used by the commander of the artillery in a central fire control station at Kuivasaari. Six meter rangefinders were also planned for the 10 inch batteries later in the war but never obtained. Searchlights Searchlights were first used at Viapori during the Russo-Turkish War in 1878, and they were originally intended for guarding the controlled mine barriers. During the First World War fortified searchlight positions were part of the coastal forts. The main line of defence had larger two searchlights at Rysäkari and Kuivasaari and an additional six smaller searchlights beside them and on the other islands. Miessaari 150 cm searchlight position was not completed during the war. In the second line 150 cm searchlights were used on Kuninkaansaari and Vallisaari, while other forts had or searchlights. Diesel generators provided the necessary electrical power to operate the searchlights. Searchlights were used in disappearing positions, where the searchlight was normally in a shelter and only exposed when needed for illumination. The disappearing positions had two types: either the searchlight was raised from the shelter by a lifting mechanism, or it was moved by rails from the shelter to position. Communications Telephone and telegraph system linked the various parts of the fortress. Krepost Sveaborg had both a regular telephone system and a second, independent telephone network dedicated for fire control. The primary telephone exchange was located on Iso Mustasaari. The various island forts had their own telephone exchanges, while Kuivasaari and Isosaari had central coastal telephone exchanges with links to other main line of defence forts. The telephone cabels on main line of defence were usually buried, while second line used overhead lines. Besides telephone optical telegraphs, signal lamps and signal flags were also used. Land front To protect Krepost Sveaborg and the naval base in particular from a German attack from land the fortifications were built to protect the fortress. The first fortifications were hastily built in 1914 to block access to the Helsinki peninsula and to guard the eastern flank of Laajasalo and Santahamina by a scarce line of fortifications at Ruskeasuo-Pasila-Käpylä-Koskela-Viikki-Herttoniemi- Roihuvuori. Lauttasaari, Meilahti and Laajasalo were also fortified to some extent. It was also planned to fortify Kulosaari and Vartiosaari. These first fortifications were field fortifications located from the city center, with the defence concentrated at fortified hilltop redoubts. In early 1915 it was decided to build new defenses further away from the city center. The new defenses were stronger fixed fortifications with positions quarried into rock or dug into ground. Fortifications were built from wood and stone masonry as well as concrete. New fortifications had a network of defensive structures, with trenches, rifle pits, machine gun nests, barbed wire obstacles, shelters and roads. Artillery batteries were located behind the front line, often located on reverse slope. Artillery batteries had 2–6, typically four, guns. Heavily fortified caponiers providing flanking fire were built on places of the front line. First a northern line was built at Leppävaara-Kaarela-Pakila- Pukinmäki-Myllypuro-Vartiokylä. Construction on a western line from Leppävaara to Westend via Tapiola began shortly afterwards. In late 1915 it was decided to build an outer line of defence on the northern and eastern sectors, extending the fortifications northward and in the east from Pukinmäki to Malmi, Mellunkylä and Vuosaari. Fortification works continued until the February revolution of 1917, and some work was done until early 1918. The land front was divided into three sectors, eastern, northern and western with 36 bases, numbered I-XXXVII. The bases were usually centered on hilltops with the strongest defences. The basic front line fortifications were open or covered machine gun nests, rifle pits, observation posts and shelters. Most of the structures were designed to be covered with a concrete roof poured on wooden planks occasionally reinforced with railway tracks. Some of the positions were built with stone or logs. Many of the fortifications have been left uncovered however, built only to a point where adding the missing roof could be accomplished quickly. The basic fortified types are a type A square machine gun nest, type B square rifle or machine gun pit, type C rounded rifle or observation pit, type D oval rifle pit with several firing ports and types E and F large rifle positions for multiple shooters. There is considerable variation between individual structures among the basic types, with newer positions generally built larger and stronger. Naval front Coastal fortifications on the naval front protected Krepost Sveaborg from an attack from the sea. During the war new fortifications were built on the outlying islands pushing the defences outward to protect the ships in the harbour from new modern guns. During the First World War the naval front of the fortress was modernized almost completely. The new gun batteries can be divided into four types: heavy long range batteries, close range batteries, anti-landing batteries equipped with field guns and anti-aircraft batteries which appeared during the war for the first time. The naval front was divided into six sectors at the start of the war with sectors 1-4 comprising the old fortress, sector 5 Isosaari and sector 6 Melkki. The central fire control post was located in Vallisaari. As the new coastal forts were completed the organization changed and the naval front was divided into two parts: an outer main line of defence from Melkki to Isosaari and an inner second line of defence from Lauttasaari to Santahamina. The naval front command post was located in Vallisaari and the main artillery command post in Kuivasaari. The long range batteries of and guns included ten batteries with six 10 inch batteries and four 6 inch batteries, with one more under construction. The basic shape of the batteries is four guns in a row protected from the front by a concrete parapet of approximately thick with traversal walls between the gun positions. The batteries had no rear protection. Shelter for crew and ammunition cellars were built into and under the front parapet and the traversal walls. While the basic plan is similar, each battery is unique depending on the terrain. For the 10 inch guns the average distance between guns is , but on smaller island such as Katajaluoto the guns are only apart while the larger Isosaari battery (No 1) has guns apart. Similarly the 6 inch batteries have guns apart on average, but in the very cramped Harmaja battery the distance between guns is only and the battery is not built on straight line but in a crooked L-shape. Many batteries have an icon closet framed with granite. Main line of defence The main line of defence was the outer seaward defence of Krepost Sveaborg. The main line of defence had the newest fortifications and the heaviest and most modern armament. At the end of the war, it comprised (from west to east): Miessaari and Pyöräsaari, Rysäkari, katajaluoto, Harmaja, Kuivasaari, Isosaari, Santahamina and Itä-Villinki islands and Skatanniemi cape. The living conditions on the small, exposed islands were often poor, and the food supply was arranged from the older parts of the fortification with a week's supply of canned food, sugar and other compact food products stored on the islands. Construction of bakeries on the outer forts began after the February revolution as a result of the demand of an artillery regiment committee formed by the soldiers. =Miessaari and Pyöräsaari= Miessaari and the small Pyöräsaari formed the western reach of the naval front main line of defence. They are located near the coast of Espoo, and protected the coastal routes on the western flank of the fortress. Miessaari naval front battery number 40 had four Canet guns, while Pyöräsaari had two two-gun batteries of light 57 mm guns. Pyöräsaari was connected to Miessaari by a bridge in 1917. The construction of the Canet gun battery began in spring 1915, the guns were installed in May 1916 and the construction was mostly finished by early 1917, though some work on the interior shelters continued until summer 1917. Pyöräsaari 57 mm gun positions were quarried in late autumn 1915 and completed in June 1916. The islands also formed the seam between naval and land fronts, and Miessaari had also a land-facing battery number 115 of six 190 pood model 1877 siege guns, supporting the base XXXIV in Haukilahti-Westend area. =Rysäkari= Rysäkari island had the westernmost 10-inch battery, and could command the western sea routes up to south-western shores of Porkkalanniemi peninsula. Construction of the battery located in the middle of the island began shortly after the war broke up, in October 1914. The guns, transported from Vladivostok, were installed by January 1915 and the entire battery with ammunition cellars and concrete command tower was finished in spring 1916. The island had two searchlights, larger 200 cm and a smaller 150 cm one. =Katajaluoto= Katajaluoto island is a narrow, north–south oriented island located approximately half way on the line between Rysäkari and Harmaja. A 10-inch battery built on the widest part divides the island into northern and southern parts. The construction of the battery began in October 1914 and the guns were placed on their foundations in early 1915 with the parapet and traversal walls completed in autumn 1915. Katajaluoto battery is the narrowest of the 10-inch batteries. The northern shore of the island has a heavily fortified concrete bunker used as mine control bunker, telephone exchange and electrical station. The island had a 150 cm searchlight. There is also a unique fortified concrete latrine on the eastern shore. Harmaja =Harmaja= Harmaja is a small island with a lighthouse south of Suomenlinna between Katajaluoto and Kuivasaari. The island has been used as a pilot station and the current lighthouse was built in 1883. At the start of the war two guns were placed on the island. These were relocated in October 1914 when construction of a 6-inch Canet battery began. The small island did not have the necessary building materials, and sand, gravel and cement had to be brought in with barges. The guns were installed in February 1915 and the battery was finished in September 1916. Harmaja battery is the smallest of the long range batteries and the guns are not located in straight line but in an L-shaped formation. A breakwater surrounds the southern end of the island. =Kuivasaari= Kuivasaari island is located west of Isosaari. Construction of a 6-inch Canet battery was planned in spring 1914, but the guns were located in Isosaari instead. After the war began construction of a 10-inch battery began on the western shore of the island. The guns, transported from Vladivostok, were placed on their foundations in February 1915 and the battery was finished in early winter of 1915. The main fire control station of the fortress with the only rangefinder was located in Kuivasaari. The island also had a 150 cm searchlight. Kuivasaari telephone exchange was also the central gunnery telephone exchange. A four-gun 75 mm anti-aircraft battery on wooden platforms was located on the northern part of the island. =Isosaari= Isosaari is the largest of the outlying islands. The island's central location and size made it the most heavily armed coastal fort and it was part of the plans for expanding Krepost Sveaborg already in 1909. In May 1914 construction of four concrete fortified batteries began: one 10 inch battery, one 11 inch battery and two 6 inch batteries. The start of the war hastened the consctruction works that had progressed slowly, and three 10 inch guns were placed on temporary wooden platforms. The concrete batteries were finished by autumn 1915, but a change in plans resulted in the second 6-inch battery being located in Santahamina instead. In January 1916 work began to modify the 11-inch battery (battery number 2) for 10-inch guns, with the modifications complete in 1916. The first 10-inch battery is located on the south-western tip of the island, while the other two batteries are on the south-eastern shore. A 150 cm searchlight was located near the first 10-inch battery and a 200 cm searchlight near the two other batteries. A narrow gauge military railway was built on the island to transport supplies and ammunition. =Santahamina= Santahamina was the largest single island in Krepost Sveaborg, and is located south of Laajasalo. Because of the size of the island Santahamina could be considered to belong to both main line of defence and the second line of defence. Santahamina was fortified during the Crimean War, and several gun batteries were built on the island during the decades between Crimean War and First World War. Most of the older guns, including eleven 6 inch 190 pood siege guns and thirteen 9 inch coastal mortars, were transported to the land front of the fortress shortly after the start of war. The remaining batteries were a 6-inch Canet battery, originally intended for Isosaari, at Itäniemi on the south-eastern part of the island and a 75 mm battery on the eastern shore. These batteries covered the sea east of Isosaari. Santahamina had a large garrison area and a substantial number of troops and supplies were located on the island. =Itä-Villinki= Itä- Villinki is located just east of the larger Villinki island. The island was a summer house district and the land had to be expropriated from the owners. Resistance by the land owners delayed the process, and was still not fully complete by late 1916. Fortification works for an 11-inch battery began in April 1915, but the battery was changed to 10 inch guns in autumn of the same year. 10 inch battery is built on a rock hilltop at the centre of the island. In July 1915 construction of a smaller battery for 75 mm guns (originally planned for 57 mm guns) on the eastern tip of the island began. =Skatanniemi= Skatanniemi peninsula in Uutela is the only place of the main line of defence on the mainland. Construction of a 6-inch Canet battery began in late 1916. The battery fortifications, the parapet and traversal walls, were finished but the command points and most other auxiliary structures were not. The guns had arrived at the battery but were never installed and were reported stored nearby on the shore and pier in 1918.Manninen 2000, pp. 81–81. Second line of defence The second line of defence included the older parts of the fortress and contained most of the storage and supply areas and other rear line functions. The fighting power of the second line was limited to quick-firing 75 mm and 57 mm guns and old 11 inch cannons and mortars. The primary combat objective of the batteries on the second line was to prevent enemy ships from passing through Kustaanmiekansalmi or Särkänsalmi straits to the inner anchorage on Kruunuvuorenselkä. The second line included Lauttasaari, Melkki, Pihlajasaaret, Harakka, the central citadel at Suomenlinna, Lonna, Vallisaari, Kuninkaansaari, Nuottasaari and Vasikkasaari. =Lauttasaari= Lauttasaari was fortified during the Crimean War, but had been disarmed in 1895. During the First World War the only battery was a land front battery number 116 at Vaskiniemi, armed with four model 1867 guns in March 1915. This battery supported base XXXVII located in southern Espoo at Tapiola—Otaniemi area. The only naval front connection Lauttasaari had was an unfinished searchlight station in Länsiulapanniemi and bakery constructed between 1916 and 1917 near the land front battery that was also used to supply the coastal forts on the nearby islands. Lauttasaari was officially delegated to land front already in spring 1915. =Melkki= Melkki is located south of Lauttasaari. Construction of a 6-inch Canet battery and 11 inch model 1877 battery began in May 1914, but the work was halted after the war began. The Canet battery was relocated to Harmaja, and the 11 inch guns were used only for a short period on temporary wooden platforms. A 75 mm anti-aircraft battery was located on the island in October 1914. In summer 1916 the guns were removed and the island was turned over for use as part of the naval base harbour facilities with machine shops and a naval mine depot. =Pihlajasaaret= Pihlajasaaret is a group of islands south of Jätkäsaari. In summer 1916 the 75 mm anti-aircraft battery on Melkki was relocated to Itäinen Pihlajasaari . The guns were on temporary wooden platforms, and the battery was relocated already in August as construction of new fortified concrete anti-aircraft positions and shelters began. The fortification work was completed but the guns were not installed before the war ended. =Harakka= Harakka is located near the coast of Helsinki, south of Kaivopuisto. In the years before First World War the island had three batteries with five model 1867 guns, four 6 inch 190 pood guns and two 57 mm quick-firing guns. As the war began the 6 inch guns were relocated to the land front while the 9 inch guns were decommissioned and left in their positions. The two 57 mm guns and two more guns from Vallisaari were relocated to a new field fortified battery on the southern tip of the island. Additionally the island had 2-4 antiaircraft guns of 75 mm or during the war. The island had also a 110 cm searchlight. Suomenlinna =The central citadel= The central citadel of Krepost Sveaborg was formed on the old Swedish fortress of Sveaborg, modern Suomenlinna . It included the islands of Kustaanmiekka, Susisaari, Iso Mustasaari, Pikku Mustasaari, Länsi-Mustasaari, Särkkä and the skerry of Pormestarinluoto. Except for the smaller Särkkä and Pormestarinluoto the islands were connected by bridges or joined together. The islands housed the fortress commander and headquarters along with the main telephone exchange and the largest dry dock in Finland at the time. The citadel also had weapons and ammunition depots and other storage areas. Most of the fortification works were concentrated on other islands, and of the older armament only one battery of three 11 inch guns remained in active service in Kustaanmiekka island. To guard Kustaanmiekansalmi strait two batteries of 57 mm guns were built, one on Kustaanmiekka and one on Iso-Mustasaari island. A third battery of 57 mm guns on Länsi-Mustasaari guarded Särkänsalmi strait. =Lonna= Lonna is a small island north of Iso Mustasaari that was used as the main naval mine depot of Krepost Sveaborg. The island had three masonry and one wooden mine storage magazines and workshops, living quarters and equipment storage for mine company ships. At the end of the war the magazines had nearly 500 mines stored with another 650 mines in the open. =Vallisaari, Kuninkaansaari and Nuottasaari= Vallisaari and Kuninkaansaari are located between Suomenlinna and Santahamina. The two islands were joined by a causeway across Kukisalmi strait at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. From the late 19th century until the First World War Vallisaari was the most heavily fortified island of the fortress. Construction of a 6-inch Canet battery on the island began in 1912, but the guns were relocated to the outer islands on the new main line of defence at the beginning of the war. Of the older guns a five-gun battery of 11 inch model 1877 guns and six-gun battery of 11 inch mortars were still used during the war. Two of the mortars were transported to the land front in early 1915, and the rest were decommissioned and abandoned on their positions in 1916. A six-gun battery of 6 inch model 1877 siege guns on fortress carriages were transported to the land front by the end of 1914. Newer artillery included two 57 mm guns that were replaced with four 75 mm guns in October 1914. Of the Kuninkaansaari batteries one four-gun battery of 11 inch model 1877 guns was kept in service. Two of the five 11 inch mortars were also in use until 1915. The rest of the guns - five 9 inch model 1867 guns, four 6 inch model 1877 siege guns, two (possibly four) 9 inch mortars and three 11 inch mortars were moved to the land front shortly after the start of the war. Both Vallisaari and Kuninkaansaari had a 150 cm searchlight stations. Small Nuottasaari island north of Haminasalmi strait between Kuninkaansaari and Santahamina was armed with four 8 inch model 1867 guns in 1887, but the island had been disarmed by 1914. =Vasikkasaari= Vasikkasaari was used as a fuel and ammunition depot of Krepost Sveaborg. The island is located in Kruunuvuorenselkä where the inner anchorage of the fortress was, between Suomenlinna, Santahamina and Laajasalo. Three large fuel oil tanks served the naval base and two smaller diesel tanks provided fuel for the mine company (later battalion) ships of the fortress. A pumping station powered by steam engine was connected to the tanks. Eight storage magazines housed weapons, ammunition, mines and torpedoes with a narrow gauge railway built on the island connecting them to the main pier. At the start of the war a 57 mm quick fire battery was located on the island, replaced by a 75 mm anti-aircraft battery in spring 1915. The anti-aircraft battery was relocated in summer 1916. A 90 cm searchlight was also located on the island. Finnish Civil War Krepost Sveaborg never did see action against Germany in Russian hands. After the Russian revolution the treaty of Brest-Litovsk ended Russia's participation in the First World War. The treaty affirmed the independence of Finland and required Russian troops to leave from the country. Of the approximately 35 000 Russian soldiers and sailors who were around Helsinki in January 1918 most were demobilized and sent home or simply left by 15 March. Around one thousand joined the Finnish Red Guards in the Finnish Civil War. The Soviet leadership ordered Krepost Sveaborg headquarters to begin preparations to abandon the fortress and destroy what could not be evacuated in case it would fall into German hands. Some field guns were transported to Russia, but all the coastal guns were left. On 3 April 1918 German Baltic Sea Division landed in Hanko, after being requested by the White Senate of Vaasa to participate in the Finnish Civil War against the Reds. Russian Baltic fleet officers had made an agreement with the Germans allowing a safe departure for the warships and disarming the fortress. Most of the Russian ships left by mid-April, but the last ships left only in May–June 1918. The disarmament - removing locks from the guns, cutting the cables controlling the mines and destroying the mine control stations - had to be done in secret as an agreement between Soviet government and Finnish Red Guards had promised the latter all the fortifications. When the Germans arrived in Helsinki the Red Guard could only use some of the land front fortifications in Leppävaara and Ruskeasuo, and the Germans with a well equipped and trained numerically superior force quickly captured Helsinki between 11th and 13 April. The Russian guards ceded the coastal forts to Germans according to their agreement. The disarmament of Krepost Sveaborg, denying the Reds from using it, was used in White propaganda by how Allan Staffans had duped the Russians and removed the locks without authorization; but actually the disarmament occurred with the order of the fortress commander and with the knowledge of naval headquarters. On 12 May Krepost Sveaborg was renamed Suomenlinna to celebrate the new independency. Later history After First World War the fortifications of Krepost Sveaborg were taken over by Finland. Most of the land front fortifications were disarmed, stripped of useful equipment and abandoned. Much of the land front fortifications with steel reinforcements were destroyed in the inter war period and the steel sold as scrap. During the Second World War an inventory of the land front fortifications was conducted regarding their usefulness, with the larger shelters quarried into the rock under particular interest as facilities for war industry, emergency hospitals or storage. Some of the land front shelters are still used as storage space. As settlement spread during the urbanization after the Second World War many of the fortifications were destroyed as new suburbs were constructed. The coastal fortifications were used by the Finnish coastal artillery to protect Helsinki. Most of the islands remained in military use and were thus spared from vandalism. All structures of the Krepost Sveaborg fortifications around Helsinki, both land and sea fronts, were declared protected historical sites by the Finnish National Board of Antiquities in 1971. Present day condition While much of land front fortifications have been destroyed, many areas have been more or less preserved and some sections have been partly restored. In Vantaa Länsiniemi and Rajakylä areas have been cleared from rubbish and vegetation. In Espoo Laajalahti, Mäkkylä, Ormberget and Ruukinranta areas have also been cleared. In Helsinki trees threatening the structure of one of the older 1914 redoubts in Rajakallio have been cut, and the city planning department has made a plan regarding the maintenance of the cleared areas and restoring new ones. Of the coastal forts, all main line of defence islands except Pyöräsaari and Harmaja are still in military use and forbidden from civilians, and Harmaja is used by the Finnish Maritime Administration as a pilot station. A coastal artillery museum has been built on Kuivasaari and the island is no longer in active military use, but still officially restricted area. Visitors are allowed but only in organized tours. It is planned to transfer Kuivasaari, together with Rysäkari, into civilian authorities. Skatanniemi cape is the only area of the main line of defence that is easily visited. The central citadel of Suomenlinna is a major tourist attraction and UNESCO World Heritage Site with regular ferry connection. The islands of Vallisaari and Kuninkaansaari are also currently being transferred to civilian authorities, with military tentatively scheduled to leave the islands by 2012. Pihlajasaaret is a Helsinki city recreation area open to public with regular ferry connection during summertime. Vasikkasaari and Lonna are also civilian areas open to visit, but more difficult to reach.

It was the home of Colonel Joseph \\"Pleasant Gardens\\" McDowell, the founder and namesake of McDowell County. It is currently undergoing extensive renovations, and is closed to the public. History The McDowell House was built in 1787, and is one of the oldest surviving frame houses in western North Carolina. Along with the nearby Carson House, it is an important piece of McDowell County history, and is currently in the process of major restoration. Built by Colonel Joseph McDowell, an American Revolutionary War hero who fought at the Battle of Kings Mountain. Joseph McDowell was a member of the Overmountain Men, traveling with Col. Charles McDowell’s regiment to the Watauga settlements in September, 1780 and on to Kings Mountain in pursuit of British Major Patrick Ferguson’s Loyalist regime. McDowell County is named in his honor. It is the last standing home place in North Carolina for which a county was named. In addition to fighting at the Battle of Kings Mountain, Colonel McDowell served in the 3rd U.S. Congress of 1793-95. He was a son of \\"Hunting\\" John McDowell, who received a Royal Land Grant from Governor Tryon on December 22, 1767 for on the Catawba River, a portion of which is the site of this home. The McDowell House was identified in the 1982 Comprehensive Management Plan for the Overmountain Victory National Historic Trail as one of only 34 non-federal historical resources which are directly or indirectly related to the Trail. In early 2008, the home and grounds were purchased and steps are being taken to create a restoration and use plan. Also in 2008, the McDowell House was officially added to the Overmountain Victory Historic Trail. Upon completion of the home restoration, this historic home will continue to serve to interpret the McDowell family history, and the history of McDowell County. Joseph McDowell Historical Catawba Greenway Construction of the Joseph McDowell Historical Catawba Greenway was completed in Summer 2010 and Phase I opened to the public in September 2010. Phase I of the Greenway offers a one-mile recreational trail, picnic area, fishing pier, wildlife observation deck, and access to the Little Round Hill Trail. In 2014, the McDowell Trails Association completed the paving of the 0.5 mile Little Round Hill Loop Trail located off of Phase I of the Greenway. Phase II of the Greenway was completed in March 2015 and extends an additional 0.7 miles to the Joseph McDowell House on US Highway 70 West and beyond. Phase II includes a paved greenway trail, paved driveway and parking lot at the McDowell House property, an amphitheater, fitness stations and a canoe launch off of US Highway 221 North Business. If you start on one end of the Greenway, walk to the other end, walk once around the Round Hill Loop and come back to the beginning, you will have walked approximately 3.2 miles and have completed a 5K.

It is classified by the Ministry of Culture as one of the Remarkable Gardens of France. The park is 17 hectares in size. It adjoins the Jardin botanique E.M. Heckel.  Description Parc Borély has three different gardens; a Garden à la française, facing the bastide, composed of a two lawns, a circular basin and a rectangual basin, and double rows of trees, between the avenue du Prado and the gates of the park: An English landscape garden, on the east side of the park, surrounding a lake, and decorated with statues, fountain, a cascade, and a playground. It also featured a miniature of the basilica of Notre-Dame de la Garde. A recently renovated race track. The other two parts of the garden connect to the sea by a promenade and to the neighboring botanical garden.  History  The park was created in the 17th century by a French ship owner and merchant, Joseph Borely, who bought land for a country house, the Château Borély, in the area of Marseille called Bonneveine. The estate was enlarged in the 18th century by Joseph Borély, who constructed a bastide, or Provençal country house, on the domaine. When Louis-Joseph Borély inherited the domaine in 1770, he commissioned the landscape architect Embry to create a Garden à la française. In the middle of the 19th century, the land passed first to Paulin Talabot, director of the new PLM railroad which connected Paris to Marseille; and then the land was acquired by the city of Marseille. The city commissioned landscape architect Adolphe Alphande to design a park with three distinct parts; a French garden, an English landscape park, and a track for horse racing by the side of the sea. A number of wooden pavilions were constructed; just one remains, the former pavilion by the lake, which had also served as a botanical laboratory of the Institut Colonial. From 1880 until 1915, the park was the site of a botanical garden, which moved to a different site adjoining the park. In 2002, a promenade of two hectares was laid out between the park and sea.

At the age of ten she obtained a divorce, breaking with the tribal tradition. In November 2008, the U.S. women's magazine Glamour designated Nujood Ali and her lawyer Shada Nasser as Women of the Year. Ali's courage was praised by prominent women including Hillary Clinton and Condoleezza Rice. Ali's lawyer Shada Nasser, born in 1964, is a feminist and specialist in human rights, whose involvement in Ali's case received much acclaim. Ali has also written a book together with French journalist Delphine Minoui called: I Am Nujood, Age 10 and Divorced. Biography Nujood Ali was nine when her parents arranged a marriage to Faez Ali Thamer, a man in his thirties. Regularly beaten by her in-laws and raped by her husband, Ali escaped on April 2, 2008, two months after the wedding. On the advice of her father's second wife, she went directly to court to seek a divorce. After waiting for half a day, she was noticed by a judge, Mohammed al-Għadha, who took it upon himself to give her temporary refuge, and had both her father and husband taken into custody.. Note: Apart from other details, this website names the judge. Shada Nasser agreed to defend Ali. For the lawyer, it was the continuation of a struggle begun with the opening of her practice in Sana'a in the 1990s as the first Yemeni law office headed by a woman. She built her clientele by offering services to female prisoners. Yemeni law at the time set the minimum age for marriage at fifteen, but families had been allowed to marry off younger girls, by stipulating in the marriage contract that sex with these young brides is forbidden until an undefined time when they are considered \\"ready.\\" In court, Nasser argued that Ali’s marriage violated the law, since her husband raped her. Ali rejected the judge's proposal that she resume living with her husband after a break of three to five years. On April 15, 2008,Ali 2010, p. 107 the court granted her a divorce. After the trial, Ali rejoined her family in a suburb of Sana'a. She returned to school in the fall of 2008 with plans to become a lawyer. Ali's memoirs, ghostwritten by Delphine Minoui, were published in 2009, and royalties from international sales of the book were intended to pay for her schooling; but she did not attend school regularly.Hersh, Joshua (4 March 2010), A TEN-YEAR-OLD’S DIVORCE LAWYER, The New Yorker, retrieved March 4, 2010. Because of negative world press coverage about Yemen resulting from the case, Ali's passport was confiscated in March 2009 and she was prevented from attending the ceremonies for the Women's World Award in Vienna, Austria. Media reports also questioned whether proceeds from the book were in fact coming to the family. In 2010, Ali's family was living in a new two-story residence bought with the help of her French publisher and running a grocery store on the ground floor of the building. At this time, Ali and her younger sister were attending private school full-time. Because the publishers were not able to pay Ali directly under Yemeni law, they agreed to give $1000 a month to her father until she was 18 to provide for her and her education. The English- language version of the memoir was published in March 2010. Introducing the work, New York Times op-ed columnist Nicholas Kristof praised the work done to raise awareness regarding such societal problems as terrorism, associated with polygamy and child marriage, saying, \\"little girls like Nujood may prove more effective than missiles at defeating terrorists.\\" Indeed, publicity surrounding Ali's case is said to have inspired efforts to annul other child marriages, including that of an eight-year-old Saudi girl who was allowed to divorce a middle-aged man in 2009, after her father had forced her to marry him the year before in exchange for about $13,000. In 2013 Ali reported to the media that her father had forced her out of their home, and has withheld most of the money paid by the publishers. Her father has also arranged a marriage for her younger sister, Haifa. He used the money earmarked for Ali's education to buy two new wives for himself, and, according to haaretz.com, sold Haifa into marriage with a much older man. Ali's ex-husband only pays her $30 a month alimony. As of June 2015, Ali, now sixteen, has unofficially changed her name from Nujood, which means \\"hidden,\\" to Nojoom, which means \\"stars in the sky.\\" According to the Huffington Post, she married in 2014 and now has two girls. Her education wasn't advanced as originally planned. Her family has been said to have pressured her to demand more money.https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/yemen-hillary- clinton_us_581e13dce4b0aac62484ca95  Bibliography  2010 - I Am Nujood, Age 10 and Divorced, New York, 2010 () References Further reading *Rozenn Nicolle \\"La petite divorced of Yemen\\", Libération, 31 January 2009 *\\"A Yemeni 10 years among women of the year,\\" Le Nouvel Observateur, 11 November 2008 *Delphine Minoui, \\"Nojoud, 10 years, divorced in Yemen\\", Le Figaro, 24 June 2008 *Cyriel Martin, \\"Yemen: a girl of 8 years gets a divorce,\\" Le Point, 16 April 2008 *Carla Power, \\"Ali & Nujood Shada Nasser: The Voices for Children,\\" Glamour, December 2008 External links *'I Am Nojoom, Age 10 and Divorced' tackles tradition *On Child Brides and Other Syrian Horrors *Untold Stories: Wedlocked Pt 1 CNN documentary about Nujood Ali's case. *Untold Stories: Wedlocked Pt 2 Category:1998 births Category:Living people Category:Child marriage in Yemen Category:Marital rape Category:Violence against women in Asia Category:Yemeni women's rights activists Category:21st-century Yemeni women Category:21st-century Yemeni people ","title":"Nujood Ali"},{"id":"21640526","text":"Courtney Knight is a Canadian Paralympian athlete competing mainly in category P13 discus throw events.

Signs and symptoms Renal oncocytoma of the right kidney at CT. Renal oncocytomas are often asymptomatic and are frequently discovered by chance on a CT or ultrasound of the abdomen. Possible signs and symptoms of a renal oncocytoma include blood in the urine, flank pain, and an abdominal mass. Pathophysiology Renal oncocytoma is thought to arise from the intercalated cells of collecting ducts of the kidney. It represent 5% to 15% of surgically resected renal neoplasms. Ultrastructurally, the eosinophilic cells have numerous mitochondria. Histologic appearance An oncocytoma is an epithelial tumor composed of oncocytes, large eosinophilic cells having small, round, benign-appearing nuclei with large nucleoli and excessive amounts of mitochondria. Diagnosis Gross appearance of a renal oncocytoma (left of image) and a slice of a normal kidney (right of image). Note the rounded contour, the mahogany colour and the central scar. In gross appearance, the tumors are tan or mahogany brown, well circumscribed and contain a central scar. They may achieve a large size (up to 12 cm in diameter). The main differential diagnosis of renal oncocytoma is chromophobe renal cell carcinoma oncocytic variant, which like the renal oncocytoma has eosinophilic cytoplasm, but has perinuclear clearing and, typically, some degree of nuclear atypia.

There are some familial cases in which these tumors are multicentric rather than solitary.Robbins pathology, page 1015 However, they may be resected to exclude a malignant tumor, e.g. renal cell carcinoma.

A study was conducted on the reproductive biology of the cockfish by Melisa A.

Another aspect of this study had discovered that the relative fecundity rate of the C. callorynchus population was significantly low because the females were in the resting stage of their reproductive cycle. Also, the males in the population weren't mature, thus the population was found to not be highly reproductive.

Syed is a British Pakistani and is the eldest son of Masood Ahmed (Nitin Ganatra) and Zainab Masood (Nina Wadia), and older brother of Tamwar (Himesh Patel), Shabnam (Zahra Ahmadi) and Kamil Masood (Arian Chikhlia). Syed's storylines see him fall in love with a man, Christian Clarke (John Partridge), and his eventual acceptance that he is gay. Syed initially marries girlfriend Amira Shah (Preeya Kalidas) but later comes out, and enters a relationship with Christian, despite the pressures of his family and his Muslim faith. In 2009, it was announced actor Marc Elliott would be joining the EastEnders cast. In an interview with Digital Spy, Elliott described his arrival: \\"It is so exciting to join the cast of EastEnders and to be working with actors such as Nina Wadia and Nitin Ganatra who I have admired for many years. \\"The Masood family have really made a name for themselves in the Square and it will be interesting see how Syed plans to stir things up!\\" In September 2012, it was announced that Elliott would be leaving EastEnders alongside John Partridge. He departed on 15 November 2012. Storylines Backstory Syed is a British Pakistani and is the eldest son of Masood Ahmed (Nitin Ganatra) and Zainab Masood (Nina Wadia), and brother of Tamwar (Himesh Patel) and Shabnam (Zahra Ahmadi). Prior to the Masoods' arrival in Walford, Syed was estranged from his family for four years. He stole from the family business, almost bankrupting them. His father took the blame, but exiled Syed from the family. Syed moved to the north of England and worked in the property industry. 2009–2012 Syed resumes contact with his family when he experiences financial difficulties. Although Masood reveals his previous theft, Zainab forgives her son, and invites him to move into the family home when he is evicted for failing to pay his rent. Syed introduces his family to his girlfriend, Amira Shah (Preeya Kalidas), who soon moves to Walford to be near him. He begins working for his parents' catering company, and develops an attraction to his colleague, Christian Clarke (John Partridge). The two have sex, and Syed admits that he has had one-night stands with men before. Conflicted by his Muslim faith, Syed proposes to Amira. He continues to see Christian, whose niece Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield) sees them kissing and blackmails him. Christian and Syed declare their love for one another, but when Masood is involved in a car accident, Syed believes he is being punished and terminates their relationship. A hurt Christian tries to move away from Walford, but is unable to forget about Syed, and returns in an attempt to deter him from marriage. On his wedding day, Syed admits to Christian that he is gay and in love with him, but feels unable to come out because of his family and faith. Zainab discovers the truth, but implores Syed to go through with his marriage. He does so, but is initially unable to consummate it. He tells his mother that the thought of sex with Amira makes him feel physically sick. He wishes to confess his sexuality, but Zainab warns him against shaming the family and threatens to disown him. Syed attempts to commit to his marriage; he has sex with Amira, and suggests starting a family. Despite his intentions, Syed resumes his relationship with Christian. Amira becomes pregnant but it was her misunderstanding and not real (but finally she will at the time she leaves, although she will not tell it to Syed). Syed intends to continue the affair, to Christian's displeasure. Syed accidentally ends up revealing to Amira that he is gay. Amira's father Qadim Shah (Ramon Tikaram) becomes very mad at him. Amira terminates their relationship and leaves Walford. Christian is attacked by Qadim, and rejects Syed when he visits him. He calls him a coward for trying to appease his family. Syed is later told to find a new mosque to attend, and implored to leave Walford by Christian's best friend Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons). He takes an overdose, and regains consciousness to hear Zainab telling him it would be better if he was dead. She burns his belongings and attempts to evict him from the family home, but is stopped by Masood. Syed begins attending therapy which he believes will cure him of his homosexuality, though it proves unsuccessful. Syed knows Christian still has feelings for him, but when he visits Christian, he rejects Syed again. The following day, Syed tells Christian he chooses him and needs his help, and that he is both gay and Muslim. The two move in together, and Syed is disowned by his parents. Syed becomes Christian's personal assistant and finds a new mosque. His parents help him escape from a fire, but they return to ignoring him in the aftermath. Trying to move on with his life, Syed starts his own massage business. He discovers that his father almost had an affair, and threatens to tell his mother, but decides against it. He is hurt when Christian kisses another man at a party, but is able to forgive him. They decide to have a child, although Syed is at first against the idea. A drunken Roxy offers to be the surrogate mother and although Syed tells Christian that it is happening too quickly, Roxy has already impregnated herself with Christian's sperm. The insemination is unsuccessful however. Syed rents a room at Roxy's salon for his massage therapy business, but steals her client list and plans to go into business with Roxy's manager, Tanya Branning (Jo Joyner). He and Christian attend Tamwar's engagement party together, much to the disgust of his parents. The roof of their restaurant collapses and knocks Syed unconscious, Christian and Yusef Khan (Ace Bhatti) come to his aid. Zainab is led to believe his condition is critical and visits him in hospital, but rejects him once he is discharged. Zainab visits Syed after being urged to by Yusef, but she leaves after a while admitting it was a mistake. However, when Masood lets Zainab down, she contacts Syed and they meet in a café. Masood discovers them but Syed says he cannot stop them seeing each other. Syed confronts Zainab and Masood in The Queen Victoria, telling them that if they do not accept Christian as Syed's lover then there is nothing more to say. Syed calls Masood a hypocrite for gambling and tells Zainab that they are in no position to judge him. He then tells them to live their lives and he will live his. Eventually, Syed and Zainab make amends. Christian and Syed try to pursue an adoption and Christian finds a new flat for them. However, Syed almost changes his mind and the couple split up until Syed realises that he does want a child. Syed tells his family he and Christian are engaged at a family meal, but they do not take the news well. Syed decides to find Amira so he can get a divorce, but has trouble finding her and Christian worries about Qadim getting involved in their lives again. It is revealed Amira is practically being held hostage by her father and that she had Syed's baby, a girl called Yasmin. Eventually Amira comes to Walford and wants Syed to be part of Yasmin's life as long as Christian is not part of it. Syed and Christian agree that their relationship comes first and they will go through the courts to gain access. However, when Christian is asleep, Syed sneaks out to meet Yasmin. Syed continues to secretly see Yasmin and Amira, but when Christian learns of this, he confronts Syed and declares that Syed has to choose between him and the baby. However, he relents and gives Syed his blessing to see his child. Once Zainab knows about Yasmin, she and Amira both try to manipulate Syed into spending more time with his daughter, at the expense of Christian. Christian reveals that he had a paternity test performed, which proves that Syed is not the father of Yasmin. Syed is devastated, but Amira continues to claim that he is the father. It later emerges that it was Yusef who falsified the paternity test. Syed and Christian then let Amira and Yasmin stay with them, as they have nowhere else to go. When Christian is falsely accused of touching 15-year-old Ben Mitchell (Joshua Pascoe), Syed and Christian argue, which leads to Christian breaking up with Syed and leaving Walford. Amira tells Syed that she has a business opportunity in Pakistan, and invites Syed to join her and Yasmin there. Syed is initially reluctant, but after Christian's sister Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) says that Christian is unlikely to reunite with him, Syed considers the move. Christian returns to Walford at Christmas, and when he sees Syed and Amira, he mocks them for behaving like a couple. However, Syed is determined to win Christian back and insists on a divorce, though Amira refuses, so he brings Qadim back to convince her. Christian and Syed then reunite, and Amira agrees to a divorce, but tells Syed that she will not leave Walford with Qadim. Amira then starts a brief relationship with Anthony Moon (Matt Lapinskas), and Syed and Amira start their business. However, Amira soon tires of Walford without a husband, and leaves her daughter Yasmin in the care of Syed and Christian. Syed is relieved when Christian finally reconciles with the Masood family, and Zainab invites Christian to a family dinner and to the mosque. Syed's business ventures fail and he is in debt to a supplier. When Zainab puts Syed in charge of Tamwar's restaurant, he forges Tamwar's signature on a cheque to pay off his debt, but leaves the restaurant in debt with the mortgage unpaid. Syed meets Danny Pennant (Gary Lucy), and they are attracted to each other. Syed invests money with Danny and borrows £500 back, but eventually the investment falls through, and Zainab also lends Syed money, taken from Kamil and Tamwar's trust funds. Syed and Danny kiss, but Syed regrets it and goes on to marry Christian in a civil ceremony after confessing the kiss. However, after the wedding, which takes place in the restaurant, bailiffs arrive as four months' mortgage is overdue. Syed tries to leave but eventually decides to stay, revealing that the debt is his fault and the money taken from the accounts was for him. Christian stays with him, saying they can sort the debts together. Syed is, however, under pressure from Danny to return the £500. Christian sees texts from Danny on Syed's phone and meets Danny, and Danny tells Christian he had sex with Syed. Christian punches Danny. Syed later sees Christian covered in blood and bruises. Christian lies that it was a homophobic attack, and Syed calls the police without Christian's knowledge. However, Christian is arrested for the assault on Danny. Danny tells Syed he will only retract his police statement if Syed returns £500 he owes. However, Masood threatens to tell the police about Danny's dodgy investments, so Danny withdraws the allegations. Christian asks Syed for his reassurance of their love and marriage or he will end their relationship. Syed cannot give it, so Christian moves out. Amira returns, wanting to take Yasmin to live with her and her new fiancé in Birmingham. Syed allows Amira to take her, not telling Christian, who is angry when he finds out. Christian plans to move to America to live with Jane. Syed discovers this through Masood, and brands Christian a hypocrite. Zainab and Lucy lock the pair in the Masoods' restaurant where they reunite. Refusing to leave without Syed, Christian has Jane book them both tickets and they leave together to go to America, planning to live closer to Amira and Yasmin once they return to the UK. Creation Syed had been mentioned regularly since the Masoods arrived in Walford in 2007, but was not introduced on-screen until April 2009. Elliott was cast in the role after a successful reading with Ganatra and Wadia. Eliott was told he had been successfully cast just before Christmas 2008. In an interview with entertainment and media website Digital Spy, Elliott commented on his casting, and the \\"responsibility\\" with regard to playing a character that viewers already had preconceived images about: \\"I hope I'm what everyone expects! I was given a biography when I got the part [...]. It's a process all characters go through to decide what they'd do in certain situations, given certain choices and basic things, for example who they'd like or dislike on [Albert] Square. That helped to cement the character in my head [...]. He's such a complex character. It's such a collaborative experience. I'm discovering things about Syed at the same time as the rest of the team.\\" To prepare for the role, Elliott watched documentaries such as A Jihad for Love which focus on the ways in which gay Muslims reconcile their faith with their sexuality. Characterisation Elliott's character is apparently a smooth-talking natural charmer who knows how to get ahead in business. He is also described as \\"handsome, suave and sophisticated\\". Executive Producer Diederick Santer described Syed as \\"Entrepreneurial, reckless, dashing and complicated, [he's] set to bring surprises and chaos to the Masood family.\\" Elliott revealed that the character is driven by money: \\"It's all about the cash. His drive is to be successful and there's nothing really Machiavellian about him — well, there potentially is — but he just wants the money because he believes he can use it to make more. [Syed]'s very cocksure and confident about himself but the absurd thing is that he hasn't learned from his past mistakes.\\" He also says that \\"Syed manipulates people to his own ends. He's charming, confident and reckless.\\" Wadia described the character as a \\"dark horse\\", saying, \\"What I like about the way they've introduced him is that you get to see the gentle side of him first — the repentant side. Then you see what he's really like over the subsequent weeks.\\" Development Shortly after his arrival, Syed's girlfriend, Amira Shah, was introduced played by Preeya Kalidas. Elliott has described the relationship between the characters and Syed's motivation: \\"Well, she's a rich daddy's girl and it's hard not to make the association between Syed and money. There's certainly an honest attraction there and I think he does love her. But the money that her father has might be an additional aspect of their relationship. Amira comes in and ruffles a few feathers, especially Zainab's. Obviously with Syed being a mummy's boy, she has to have her say. I don't think Zainab would be happy with anyone that Syed's with — they'd have to be absolutely perfect. Mummy Masood will be doing a lot of meddling and locking horns with Amira.\\" In June 2009, Syed begins an affair with gay character Christian Clarke, played by John Partridge, a storyline that will see Syed \\"torn between his feelings and [his] faith\\". The storyline is said to be controversial, as homosexuality is strictly forbidden in Islam. However, Santer explained that the storyline will not be a moral tale, but one of human interest, adding: \\"In this regard, it's not dissimilar to the story we told when Dot Cotton's deeply-held Christian beliefs came into conflict with her desire to alleviate Ethel's suffering [in a euthanasia plotline]. To all intents and purposes, Syed is a 'good' Muslim man: he doesn't drink, smoke or engage in sex before marriage. But he struggles with his sexuality when he finds himself drawn to Christian and he believes this goes against his faith. This is not a story about Syed and Christian's physical relationship — we don't see anything beyond one kiss. It's more about the inner turmoil and conflict Syed endures trying to remain true to his faith while questioning his sexuality. Syed has already been ostracised from his family and community once and if he's true to his heart he risks losing his family again.\\" Santer also said that EastEnders always tries to \\"reflect modern life in multicultural Britain and [tell] social issue stories relevant to [its] diverse audience.\\" Elliott commented on the storyline, saying: \\"I think EastEnders would be doing the programme a disservice if they didn't give a voice to various communities. I think that's really important because I think London is a very ethnically diverse multicultural place, and EastEnders has a job to reflect that in the story lines it gives people and the characters they have on board.\\" This plot was researched with help from academics, gay Muslim support groups and members of the Muslim Council of Great Britain, and will contain a \\"balance of opinions\\" from various other characters, including Syed's mother Zainab. When asked in a BBC interview in September 2009 if Syed is gay or bisexual, Elliott answered: \\"I think at this stage there's confusion about his sexuality. He knows he likes Christian but it hasn't really been stipulated. He wants to settle down and have children with Amira because that's what's expected of him, but he finds himself unavoidably attracted to Christian so that's what's going on in his head.\\" He went on to say that Syed is still attracted to Amira but only because \\"that's what he’s meant to do\\", adding that \\"he's probably conning himself.\\" Christian's friend James Mackie, played by Paul Keating arrives and when Syed refuses to break up with Amira, Christian starts a relationship with James to forget Syed. Elliott says that this is the moment when Syed realises his feelings for Christian go beyond sexual attraction. Elliot explains that Syed and Amira have never been intimate, in theory because of their religion, but adds that Syed is probably scared to get intimate with her and is merely hiding behind his religion. In December 2009, Santer was asked what his favourite story line of the year had been. He replied \\"I'm really pleased with the Christian/Syed story line. It's bold and we thought long and hard before we did it to make sure we got it right and I'm really proud with what we've done. Marc [Elliott] and John [Partridge] have absolutely stepped up to the plate and like all good EastEnders stories, we're not even half done with it yet. There's miles to go.\\" Syed and Amira's wedding takes place on screen on 1 January 2010. They have a traditional Pakistani wedding featuring horses, drummers and dancers. Scriptwriters researched by watching videos of a real British Pakistani wedding. BBC Asian Network reporter Shabnam Mahmood also advised on the wedding. The wedding and its build-up were filmed over a two- week period and Elliott required three two-hour riding lessons before he could film the horseback scenes. He revealed: \\"I was quite proud of myself, though, as I managed to canter although I don't do that around the Square as it's not that big. During rehearsals the horse, Storm, was really well behaved and it all went fairly smoothly. But as soon as it came to the actual filming and all the drums and banners came out, it wasn't so easy. I think she walks sideways for quite a bit of the time. But I'm just pleased that I didn't end up impaled on the railings in Albert Square. I think avoiding that was quite an achievement.\\" John Partridge choreographed the dance scenes and Elliott took six weeks to learn the dance, saying: \\"I couldn't have done it without him [Partridge]. He had me practising in every spare moment, even in the hallways by myself as he wanted to see a marked improvement on my routine. Preeya kept getting occasional glimpses of me practising in the hallways and she didn't look too impressed with what she saw. Johnny did a great job with that routine, although I added in the back flip myself! By the end of it, I ate, slept and dreamt that dance.\\" Before the wedding, Syed's affair with Christian is revealed to his mother Zainab and he admits to her that he is gay. She urges him to go ahead with the wedding and only a small number of people know about Syed and Christian. Elliot said he was pleased that the affair came out this way, as \\"it's far more realistic this way\\". He added that the writers would have \\"done the story a disservice\\" if Syed and Christian had ended up with their 'happily ever after', saying \\"they need to show the life after the wedding and show how Syed will cope living with a wife who he loves, but not in the way he loves Christian. He has to live with the fact that he's not being true to himself over his sexuality.\\" Elliott noted a change in Syed's personality, saying \\"Syed's starting to show signs of being quite a cruel character but it's only through his own bitterness and resentment that he starts acting the way he does – it's the way he deals with it. Poor Amira's none the wiser, so Syed's not acting right and she has no idea why.\\" In 2011, a same-sex parenting storyline which sees Christian and Syed finding a surrogate mother was reported by the Daily Mirror. If true, it will form one of the year's biggest plots, expected to controversial and a ratings hit. In March 2011, it was reported that a Syed would be among characters sustaining injuries when the roof of his parents' restaurant, The Argee Bhajee, collapses. The scenes, to air in April 2011, were filmed in February, and a spokespoerson said \\"Despite the ill-feeling between him and his parents, Syed is in the building when the disastrous party takes place. But what the accident could mean for the family feud remains to be seen.\\" The plot could see Syed and Christian share more screentime with the rest of the Masood family, as Partridge commented that the issues may start to be resolved, though not necessarily leading to the outcome viewers will want. A scene showing Syed and Christian naked in bed together prompted over 100 complaints to the BBC. EastEnders executive producer Bryan Kirkwood was forced to defend the scenes. The mixed response from viewers to the scenes confirms the findings of a BBC survey last year, which showed that gay relationships are still a divisive issue. On the other hand, some other viewers praised the BBC for showing \\"the fabulous portrait of the relationship between Syed and Christian\\". The viewer said the gay bed scene was a \\"big step towards equality\\". The BBC stated in response The BBC's statement said: \\"EastEnders aims to reflect real life, and this means including and telling stories about characters from many different backgrounds, faiths, religions and sexualities\\". Civil partnership It was confirmed that newcomer Danny Pennant (Gary Lucy) would be romantically linked to Syed, who is embroiled in a serious relationship with Christian Clarke (John Partridge). Elliott revealed Danny would return, saying: \\"He returns – he can't be punched in the face in the Argee Bhajee and leave without his dignity! He's got to come back and get some sort of revenge, and he does.\\" Elliott also stated that Christian would get involved with the city banker, stating: \\"Christian becomes involved in a storyline with him, which involves the police and possibly arrests.\\" Finally Elliott expressed his happiness on his parents accepting his relationship with Christian, explaining: \\"I think that's been really important. Obviously there's been a three and a half year build to them getting married, and I think there has been a huge shift. But then I think when we started the story, we were surprised by how accepting the audience was and how ready they were to see something like that. It's been brilliant.\\" Departure On 7 September 2012, it was announced that Syed and Christian would be departing in November 2012 in an explosive storyline that bosses did not reveal at the time. Executive producer Lorraine Newman said: \\"Marc and John have been a fantastic part of the show and their characters have been a huge success. Their storylines have broken boundaries that have not been seen in a soap before and the love for them by the viewers can be seen in their 'Chryed' fans. When Marc announced he had decided to move on, we had a tough decision to make. After numerous conversations, which included John, it was decided that there is only one outcome for Syed and Christian. We wish them both all the best for the future.\\" Reception Critically, both Syed's gay storyline and Marc Elliott's acting were well received, with Elliott winning Best Newcomer at The British Soap Awards in 2010. From its inception, however, Syed's gay storyline was criticised by Asghar Bokhari of the Muslim Public Affairs Committee, who said \\"The Muslim community deserves a character that represents them to the wider public because Islamophobia is so great right now. There's a lack of understanding of Muslims already and I think EastEnders really lost an opportunity to present a normal friendly Muslim character to the British public.\\" One British Muslim fan of EastEnders reportedly told the Al Arabiya news channel that the storyline \\"is not a true reflection of the majority of Muslims in the United Kingdom.\\" Another British Muslim said \\"I think it's bad, it is going to give a bad impression about Islam. The type of people that watch EastEnders are going to be very naïve about such a portrayal of Muslims,\\" but added that Muslims probably would not boycott the show as \\"generally practicing Muslims don't really watch EastEnders.\\" Diederick Santer responded to the criticisms of Muslim viewers by saying \\"It's really important that [...] we give the Masoods big stories. Sometimes there's a danger of being too careful with black or Asian characters that we might go into territories that might offend. But it seems to me if we steer away from any controversy, they don't stand a chance of being a great EastEnders family — they'll just be in their kitchen unit making curries for years and years and that's not going to be very interesting.\\" Yusuf Wehebi from LGBT Muslim advocacy group Imaan said: \\"It is high time that the invisible minority became a visible minority. It is entirely possible to be Muslim and gay and there [are] many of us in Britain today. It is great that the BBC have had the courage to raise such an important social issue in our society today.\\" The kiss between Syed and Christian was watched by 7.9 million viewers. Elliott told Soaplife magazine that he has received no negative feedback from the show's fans for the storyline. The 1 January 2010 episode in which Syed marries Amira in a Pakistani wedding received overnight ratings of 11.64 million viewers, an average audience share of 39.3%. The ultimate five minutes of the episode, in which Christian and Syed share an emotional goodbye, received a peak of 12.34 million viewers. The wedding was criticised by a writer for Asian Image, who said \\"With so much resources at hand they couldn't even get a Muslim wedding right. It was colourful and noisy but the priest couldn't speak the lingo properly and the wedding vows were all wrong. What was the priest doing sat between the bride and groom? At least attempt to make it as realistic as possible. It was Indian and then Pakistani – what on earth was going on! For a prime-time show which was watched by millions at least try to get as close to a real Pakistani Muslim wedding as possible. The whole thing reminded me of one of 1960s botched jobs put together by some middle- aged white man who 'thought it happened this way so it must!'\\" A Channel Five retrospective on soap weddings in 2010, however, deemed the \\"dramatic Bollywood-style wedding\\" to be \\"spectacular\\". In July 2010, viewers complained after Syed was seen dropping his Qu'ran in frustration. The BBC responded by saying \\"It was not intended to be a disrespectful act, rather a totally spontaneous one, symbolic of Syed's utter confusion and frustration at what feels like an impossible situation. It wasn't our intention to cause any offence.\\" Additionally, Ofcom received 23 complaints from viewers who said the gay Muslim storyline was offensive to their faith. In the same month, the Syed-Christian storyline was commented on in Stonewall research, which found that positive and realistic gay characters appear in just 0.6% of broadcast television. Stonewall noted the romance storyline was a predominantly violent and unhappy one. Among readers of Inside Soap, Syed and Christian came second in a poll of characters favoured to marry on-screen in 2011. In January 2011, Elliott was nominated for Serial Drama Performance at the 2011 National Television Awards for his portrayal of Syed. Inside Soap readers voted Syed their favourite member of the Masood family. Kate White from Inside Soap ran a feature on what Christmas presents she would give to soap characters. White said she would buy Syed a backbone in the hope he would stand up for himself, as his \\"lack of will power\\" drove Christian away. Following the storyline where Syed causes his family to lose their restaurant, Heat called him \\"clinically stupid\\". Response from previous cast members Syed, along with the rest of the Masood family, was criticised by actor Deepak Verma, who played Sanjay Kapoor between 1993 and 1998. He said that EastEnders had failed to portray Asian families in a realistic manner, branding the family \\"two- dimensional and ill-conceived\\". A BBC spokesperson responded by saying \\"It's a shame Deepak feels that way but that's clearly his personal opinion. The Masood family have proved to be hugely popular with EastEnders viewers.\\" During Syed's gay storyline, actor Jimi Mistry, who played gay Asian character Fred Fonseca in EastEnders between 1998 and 2000, expressed surprise in October 2009 at another gay Asian storyline in the programme. Mistry said \\"It's amazing, isn't it? It was ten years ago when we did it and they're still going down that path. I can't really comment though. I did my stint and I did see they were going along that road again but it's their choice. They must think that people have forgotten the last time they did it, so maybe they're just redoing it in a different way.\\" See also * List of EastEnders characters (2009) * List of LGBT characters in television and radio * List of soap operas with LGBT characters * List of soap opera villains References Category:Ahmed family Category:Television characters introduced in 2009 Category:EastEnders characters Category:Fictional businesspeople Category:LGBT and Islam Category:Fictional Islamic people Category:Fictional gay males Category:Male villains Category:Fictional market stallholders Category:Fictional attempted suicides Category:Fictional LGBT characters in television Category:Male characters in television Category:LGBT villains ","title":"Syed Masood"},{"id":"21640847","text":"Reformation 01 is a box set by VNV Nation that was released on April 24, 2009 in Europe and May 12, 2009 in North America containing; a 12 track live CD, a 13 track Bonus Disc of remixes and previously unreleased material, and a DVD with 8 videos of live footage recorded from 2005 - 2008.

Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 167 U.S. 43 (1897), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States sustained a conviction of a man for making a speech on Boston Common in violation of an ordinance that forbade the making of a public address there without a permit from the mayor.  Facts of the case  Section 66 of the Revised Ordinances of the City of Boston (1893) reads as follows: > 'Sec. 66. No person shall, in or upon any of the public grounds, make any > public address, discharge any cannon or firearm, expose for sale any goods, > wares or merchandise, erect or maintain any booth, stand, tent or apparatus > for the purposes of public amusement or show, except in accordance with a > permit from the mayor.' It was alleged by the prosecution that Davis made a speech on Boston Common without a permit. Davis was brought before the Municipal Court of the City of Boston and convicted of violating section 66.  Prior history  The proceedings were removed to the Superior Court of the county of Suffolk, where Davis renewed a motion which he had interposed in the municipal court to quash the complaint. There were seven reasons argued to support the motion; among these was the assertion that the ordinance violated the rights alleged to be secured to the accused by the constitution of the state, and by the Fourteenth Amendment. The motion to quash being overruled by the Superior Court, Davis was tried before the court and a jury. At the trial the government put in evidence the ordinance heretofore referred to, and called the attention of the court to sections 35 and 39 of chapter 448 of the acts passed by the legislature of Massachusetts in the year 1854. Davis was convicted and subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court.  Decision  Davis' conviction was upheld by a unanimous decision of the Supreme Court.

Minichiello and Cooke won the gold medal in the two-woman event at the FIBT World Championships 2009 in Lake Placid, New York. The pair finished seventh at the same event in St Moritz in 2010, despite some difficulty with Cooke's prototype racing suit, which split open in the seat, seconds before the start of her bobsleigh run.http://www.metro.co.uk/sport/oddballs/809721-british-female-bobsleigh- riders-spandex-bum-flash-is-a-youtube- hithttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYIxwM7GVik At the 2010 Winter Olympics, they crashed out during the third run of the two-woman event and did not start the final run as a result. Following Minichiello's retirement from the sport, Cooke became brakewoman for Paula Walker, Minichiello's successor as British no. 1 driver. Rebekah Wilson replaced Cooke as Walker's partner and took the GBR1 slot for Sochi in 2014. Following her non-selection Cooke retired from bobsleigh and returned to athletics, attempting to obtain selection for the Scottish team in the long jump at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. However, she did not make the squad after she achieved the qualifying standard once, rather than twice as required, although her second longest jump was only 3 cm short of the standard.

Built presumably in the 4th century by the King Mirian III, and reconstructed in the 11th century by the King George I and Catholicos-Patriarch Melchizedek I, Samtavro is an important Early and High Medieval historical and architectural monument, protected by UNESCO. Samtavro church is cross-in-square temple, with and other decorations typical for the 11th century Georgian architecture. The famous Georgian Saint monk Gabriel is buried in the yard of Samtavro Church. History The monastery was constructed in the northwestern part of the old town of Mtskheta. Unfortunately, no inscriptions remain to tell about its construction time. According to the Georgian hagiographic sources the monastery was established in the 4th century, during the reign of the King Mirian III of Iberia, when a small church was built here by Saint Nino in connection with conversion of Georgia in Christianity. Mirian and his wife Nino were buried in the monastery. The tombs of Mirian and Nana The name \\"Samtavro\\" can be translated from the Georgian language as \\"ruler's place\\" (მთავარა [mtavara], meaning \\"ruler\\"). The main temple is stylistically dated to the first half of the 11th century, and was probably built or rebuilt soon after Svetitskhoveli cathedral, with Catholicos-Patriarch Melchizedek I. Its dome was destroyed in 1283 by earthquake, and restored some time between the end of 13th and the beginning of 14th century. From around the same time dates the altar iconostasis. Minor renovations have also been done for the facades. The wall, surrounding the monastery, was built in the Late Middle Ages, with the bell-tower added in 16th century. Original frescos did not survive, and the new were painted in 16-17th century. Other renovations were made in 17th century and later. The wall was constructed in 18th century. Grave stones for the burials of Mirian and his wife Nana were made in 19th century. Architecture Samtavro church is a typical example of a cross-in-square temple. Its dome rests on two pillars and the projecting walls of the altar apsidal. Being a later reconstruction, the dome does not fit into general proportions and the style of the 11th century. The church has two entrances: southern, with the portal, and western. The facades are made of yellow and brown stones. The portal, decorated in arches, also has rather fine ornamental carvings on plafonds. Open interior is well illuminated from windows, both on the dome and on all four walls of the church. Decorations of the southern facade and the dome In accordance with the standards of 11th century, putting accent on decorations, the facades are richly decorated, but variously, considering difference in the illumination. Such dualism is not common for that period.Джанберидзе Н., Мачабели К. (1981) Тбилиси. Мцхета. Москва: Искусство, 255 c. (In Russian) Accent was made on southern and northern facades. Decorations of the southern facade are rather fine, but rougher on the northern. The architect's idea was to express the effect of line movement. Eastern facade is more reserved. Most of the contrast here is created by triangular niches. Arches and windows have the signs of later alterations, including addition of the cross of the wall. Decorations of the western facade are even more simple. Portal here is more recent. Fragments of frescos remain in the dome and altar. Apart from the main temple, the monastery includes a small church, the bell-tower, a cylindrical tower, remnants of palace and some modern structures, all surrounded by the wall. St. Nino's Church The bell- tower, situated in the north-west corner of the wall, has three floors. The ground floor incorporates the entrance to the territory, the first floor was served both for observation and for living, and the second floor is an open belfry. A small church, standing to right from the entrance, was rebuilt several times. It was said to be originally built by Saint Nino of Cappadocia, who converted Georgia into Christianity. Burials The tombs of King Mirian III and his wife Nana, are found inside the church in the south-west part.

Schulte (April 27, 1890, in Cincinnati, OH – June 7, 1975, in Cincinnati, OH) was an architect who designed a number of mid-twentieth- century churches notable for their blending of a modern idiom with traditional function. Inspired by an encounter with Ralph Adams Cram, he devoted himself to building church buildings, designing over 88.Heavenly City, p. 142, Denis R. McNamara, James Morris (Liturgy Training, 2005) He served as president of the Cincinnati chapter of the American Institute of Architects.The Spirit of Mediator Dei, Denis McNamara, Sacred Architecture, Vol. 4 (2000) Schulte had a sole practice after 1912, then practiced with Robert E. Crowe from 1921–1923, and practiced alone after that to 1967. Early life and education Edward Schulte displayed a talent for drawing early on and was encouraged to pursue it by the nuns in the parochial school he attended as a child. His father, a building contractor, wanted him to take up architecture instead, suggesting him to the firm of Werner and Adkins, who had designed a Carnegie library for Norwood. (Schulte’s father was one of three trustees to build it.) Schulte began working for Werner and Adkins during the day while attending classes at the Art Academy at night, eventually becoming a valued member of the firm with a special skill for watercolor renderings of proposed projects for client presentations. Before long, however, Werner and Adkins began to suffer from financial problems, temporarily loaning Schulte out to another firm before bringing him back upon securing a new partner – H.E. Kennedy – and several new commissions, among them an office building for New Orleans. Early career Kennedy was awarded the commission to design the Harris Theater in downtown Pittsburgh and had Schulte design it – a task that required him to spend long nights in the library researching precedents for the relatively new building typology. Among the draftsmen for the project was Robert E. Crowe, who would later become Schulte's partner and most important collaborator. Upon the success of the Harris Theatre project, Kennedy moved his office to Pittsburgh, bringing Schulte along with him. It was during this time that Schulte attended a candlelit lecture by Ralph Adams Cram at the Hall of Architecture in the Carnegie Museum, inspiring him to focus on churches over the remainder of his career. Schulte was the only architect of the Twentieth Century to design four cathedrals. He also renovated St. Peter in Chains Cathedral in Cincinnati.http://www.thecatholictelegraph.com/symposium-honors-legacy-of- local-church-architect/490 List of buildings designed or overseen This list of Schulte's work was compiled by Donald A.

Helsingborgs Dagblad referred to the album as \\"pre-school pop\\" that \\"too often veer into accordion-circus-music on drugs\\". Still the review stressed that \\"the joy of the music is contagious\\" and that the best part of the album is its \\"melancholic, french sound\\". The review summarized the album as \\"a 40 minute long lullaby for three year olds\\".

Playing career He began playing for the Moose Jaw Warriors of the Western Hockey League in 1991-92, and stayed there until the 1995-96 season when he moved to the Brandon Wheat Kings (also of the WHL). Following this season he moved on to the Wichita Thunder of the Central Hockey League, before his move to the South Carolina Stingrays for the 1998-99 season. This was a successful spell for Lehman, who in his 4 seasons for South Carolina won a Kelly Cup (2000–01) and also received a call up to the Rochester Americans of the AHL.Jody Lehman's Statistics at hockeydb.com URL accessed 2009-03-01 But following the 2001-02 season Lehman moved across the Atlantic to play for the British side the Coventry Blaze. His first season was very successful as the Blaze won major honours, winning the league and the playoffs (the team went unbeaten winning the playoffs). The next season the Blaze and Lehman moved into the newly formed Elite Ice Hockey League(EIHL) finishing 3rd in its inaugural season. The next season (2004–05) was a highly successful season for both Lehman and the Blaze as they dominated the league backed by the outstanding netminding of Lehman who had his best season for the Blaze. They went on to win the Grand Slam, winning the league, playoffs and the challenge cup. The goaltending of Lehman had been a key to this success, which was demonstrated in the playoff finals, where the Blaze won a tight game in overtime beating the Nottingham Panthers. Following the Grand Slam season, Lehman decided to move to fellow EIHL side the Sheffield Steelers. His first two season there were far less successful both stats wise and in terms of trophies (collecting just the British Knockout Cup, after beating the Blaze over two legs). Things turned around in the 2007-08 season as the Steelers made a late challenge for the League title, only to fall just short after a tremendous late season surge in results. They did, however, go on to win the Playoff championship. In the quarter-finals they beat the Manchester Phoenix 9-8 over two legs to qualify for the Playoff finals weekend. Here Lehman played some of the best hockey of his career, first holding the Cardiff Devils to a single goal, and saving a penalty shot in a 2-1 win. Then in the final, the Steelers beat the League champions the Coventry Blaze (2-0), with Lehman shutting them out in a tremendous performance, particularly in the closing stages as the Blaze poured on the pressure. After speculation that Lehman would sign with another European side, he eventually re-signed for his fourth season with the Steelers. After a shakey start to the season, in which they were knocked out of both the Challenge Cup and Knockout Cup early, the Steelers settled down. After a long season, the Sheffield Steelers won the Elite League for the first time in 5 years, thanks largely to Lehman's outstanding performances throughout the season. At the Steelers' final home game of the season on 21 March 2009, Lehman broke the British ice hockey goaltending record for most shutouts in a season. The 4-0 shutout of Basingstoke Bison was Lehman's 9th of the season. In April 2009, Lehman announced that he felt he had achieved everything possible in the British game, and saw his move to Denmark as a fresh challenge. Lehman now resides in his hometown of North Battleford, Sask., with his wife and children.

This condition falls between chronic and acute, sometimes transitioning into a chronic condition. Many people experience a recurrence of the condition after periods of remission. Middle-aged patients are the most prone age group to this condition. Presentation The most common prurigo simplex symptoms are skin nodules resembling insect bites that are intensely itchy. These nodules are frequently scratched open, becoming lesions that continue to itch. Sometimes the skin thickens and becomes discolored around the nodules. The scalp, arms, legs and trunk of the body are the most frequent sites of the bumps and lesions. Itching can become severe and habitual, worsening the condition and possibly causing infections in the open sores. Treatment Treatment is challenging, with narrow band UVB or pimozide sometimes helpful. Prognosis Sometimes the nodules become less itchy and eventually disappear leaving a discolored area or scar tissue. The same nodules can persist for months or even years, though, without healing. Patients may experience a remission but then relapse with new nodules forming. The condition might also become chronic, with no periods of improvement and relief.

It was founded in 1988 by Tim Slade and Jules Leaver as a business selling T-shirts at ski resorts. The company opened its first retail shop in 1993; there were 209 Fat Face stores in the UK and Ireland. History The business was founded in 1988 in French ski resort Méribel by Tim Slade, a former policeman, and business graduate Jules Leaver. The pair bought T-shirts wholesale, had them printed with designs specific to the resort, and sold them to other skiers on the slopes - at first using the proceeds only to fund their own skiing. They spent the following years travelling to different ski resorts, where they continued to produce and sell ski and outdoor-related clothing. In 1993 they opened their first shop, on London's Fulham Road; they named it \\"Fat Face\\" after the Face de Bellevarde slope in Val-d'Isère. In 2000, they sold 40% of the company to Livingbridge for £5 million. In 2005 Advent International, a private equity company, bought Livingbridge's interest in FatFace. In 2007 Fat Face was acquired, for £360 million, by private equity group Bridgepoint Capital; the sale netted Slade and Leaver £90 million. The company's sales were badly hit by the Great Recession, forcing Bridgepoint to write off half the company's value, but improved in 2010 and again in 2011, and Fat Face returned to a small profit in 2012. Bridgepoint planned to float a quarter of the company on the London stock exchange in 2014, hoping to raise £110 million, but later cancelled the flotation due to lack of confidence by prospective stockholders. The Chief Executive is Liz Evans, who joined in March 2019 replacing Anthony Thompson. Evans had previously run Oasis/Warehouse. In 2013 Bridgepoint hired former Marks and Spencer Chief Executive Stuart Rose to be FatFace's Chairman; Rose replaced Alan Giles as Chairman.

The Autotrain was a type of passenger train used in the early 20th century, where the steam locomotive could be remotely controlled from the rear of the train. This meant that the engine would not have to run-around at the end of a journey before returning. These trains were also known as motor trains or railmotors at the time, but the term railmotor is now used to refer to trains where the steam engine was integrated into the coach. A driving cab in the rearmost coach (known as an autocoach or auto trailer) has controls to allow the driver to operate the regulator, brake and whistle when driving the train 'in reverse'. The fireman would remain on the engine in order to stoke the fire and to take off the brakes, as the driver could only apply them. Autotrains could operate with one or two coaches: either with the locomotive at the front or rear of the formation, or sandwiched between the two driving coaches. Autotrains were being used by most rail companies in Great Britain by the 1920s, and were particularly common on branch line services. They remained in widespread use until the 1950s and 1960s, when they were replaced by diesel multiple units (DMUs). They were in effect the ancestor of the modern driving trailers.

History The board, established by Congress on 10 April 1869, authorized the president to organize a board of not more than ten persons \\"to be selected by him from men eminent for their intelligence and philanthropy, to serve without pecuniary compensation.\\"United States Statutes at Large, XVI, 40. It remained an all-Protestant, male bodyFritz, Henry E. Board of Indian Commissioners. Answers.com. Accessed 21 February 2009. until 1902, when President Theodore Roosevelt appointed two Roman Catholics to fill vacancies.Thirty-Fourth Annual Report of the Board of Indian Commissioners, 1902 (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1903), 22-23. The Board of Indian Commissioners established what an \\"Indian\\" was, and the rights that they were given, through the different laws and regulations for educating Indians that the board established. An Indian was determined based on their physical appearances. However, legally, it was difficult to determine what rights to give Indians, as according to the board, they weren't aliens or foreigners, however, they weren't citizens by birth. The board therefore determined how to go about treating Native Americans. The members of the board all held semi-official positions within the government, unlike other humanitarian boards. However, the amount of work that the board was able to accomplish was rather compromised, because Congress held the board responsible for funding, and didn't give sufficient powers to enforce either their fundings or recommendations. Grant's Indian peace policy Beginning in 1869, and in concert with the board, President Ulysses S. Grant attempted to formulate a new humane policy towards Native American tribes that was free of political corruption. Known as the Peace Policy, it aimed to place Native Americans on reservations where, in collaboration with Christian Church organizations, the Office of Indian Affairs would provide Native Americans with moral and competent Indian agents, establish churches and schools, teach agriculture and civilized pursuits and provide high-quality supplies at reasonable prices. In 1872, the implementation of the policy involved the allotting of Indian reservations to religious organizations as exclusive religious domains. Of the 73 agencies assigned, the Methodists received fourteen; the Orthodox Friends ten; the Presbyterians nine; the Episcopalians eight; the Roman Catholics seven; the Hicksite Friends six; the Baptists five; the Dutch Reformed five; the Congregationalists three; Christians two; Unitarians two; American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions one; and Lutherans one. In the same year, 1872, Presbyterian, Methodist, and Episcopal missions converted more than 600 Sioux, Chippewas, Nez Percés and other Native Americans to these religions. In order to join these Christian religions, the Native Americans were required to shave their hair, adopt civil clothing, and go to work for his living. In essence, the conversion of Native Americans to these Christian religions was an attempt at assimilating Native Americans to the white man's society. The distribution caused immediate dissatisfaction among many groups who claimed that they had been slighted or overlooked. The selection criteria were vague and some critics saw the Peace Policy as violating Native American freedom of religion. Among the Roman Catholics, this dissatisfaction led to the establishment of the Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions in 1874. The Peace Policy remained in force until 1881, when the government heeded the protests of religious organizations whose missionaries had been removed from reservations on which they had not been assigned.Francis Paul Prucha, American Indian Policy in Crisis, Christian Reformers and the Indian, 1865-1900, (2014) , 30-71.  The Board after 1900  Although the Board of Indian Commissioners began to lose influence in 1900, the appointment of new members quickly revived it. The introduction of Warren K. Moorehead to the Board led to the Board becoming aware of diseases that existed on reservations, as Moorehead was dedicated to this. The fight against diseases on reservations was continued by the board member Charles Burke in 1923, when he began a health drive. Although the Board of Indian Commissioners continued to accomplish its goals of fighting disease on reservations, assimilating Native Americans into popular society, and making citizenship available to Native Americans throughout the Progressive Era and well into the 1920s, the Board was terminated by John Collier in 1933, as there was no funding for the Board in the New Deal.

The film is the sequel to Rich and Famous but was released first due to its appeal as an action film. Summary The movie begins in 1980. Lee Ah- chai (Chow Yun-fat) has slowly become passive with his focus on family life. Meanwhile, Yung (Alex Man) is now out of jail and is now a rising power within Chu Lo-tai's gang. They run into each other at a gangster's funeral. Ah-chai shakes his hand and Yung reminisces sarcastically about how he was once taught a lesson by Ah-chai. (Ah-chai shot Yung in the hand, after Yung killed a friend of Chai's for money; this is addressed in the prologue of the movie, and shown in full in Rich and Famous.) Yung's sister, Wai-chui (Pauline Wong) picks up their father, who is going to visit with his stepson Kwok (Andy Lau) in Malacca. Kwok is now married to a local woman and has adopted many children. His father tells Kwok that Ah-chai might be in danger of being killed by Yung. Ah-chai meets with Chu Lo-tai (Ko Chun-hsiung), his previous rival, now his business partner. Ah-chai warns Chu Lo-tai that perhaps Yung is becoming too powerful. Chu Lo-tai acknowledges this threat and plots to have Yung assassinated. Chu Lo-tai and his gang meet for dinner and Chu confronts Yung angrily after another one of Yung's rude outbursts. Two of Chu's men draw their guns at Yung. Yung reaches for an oyster shell. At that signal, most of Chu Lo-tai's gang turn against him and Yung stabs Chu Lo-tai to death with a broken bottle. Yung now leads Chu's gang. Ah-chai's wife Po-yee (Carina Lau) goes to the mall with her son where she runs into Yung and his men. Yung flirts with Po-yee, who refuses his advances. He then orders his men to attack Number 6 (Shing Fui-On) and Chuan (Ng Hong-ming), who valiantly fight against 8 men and lose. Ah-chai arranges to have a meeting with Yung at a club. The meeting goes badly for Chai as Yung takes opportunities to insult him, while he realizes their mutual police ally is not totally on his side against Yung. Yung provokes Ah-chai into splashing water into his face. Later that evening, Ah-chai and his two lieutenants, Number 6 and Big Eye (Lam Chung) discuss what to do about Yung. They both note the need to take action and strike first. Ah- chai says that he will call a meeting with the other remaining gangs to wipe Yung out. Ah-chai is then interrupted and told that his son is ill and that he will need to take him to the hospital. His two lieutenants are disappointed that their boss has grown soft. Yung is then unexpectedly visited by Kwok who begs for Yung not to kill Ah-chai. Yung humiliates his step brother by forcing him to beg for forgiveness and serving him tea on one knee. Yung then stops the embarrassment and hugs Kwok, telling him that he will oblige as long as Ah-chai does not attempt anything first. The following morning, Kwok is driven to the airport by his step sister Wai-chui and Kwok has Wai-chui swear to secrecy that no one knows that he has come to talk to Yung. She promises to. Kwok then jokes that Wai-chui is now almost 30 and still works for Ah-chai and that she should settle down. Wai-chui admits that she loves Ah-chai too much and cannot bear to leave his side. Kwok jokingly promises to keep that a secret but says that if she doesn't move on after 2 years that he's going to tell Ah-chai about it. The scene switches back to Number 6 as he decides to take matters into his own hands. Big Eye tells him to be careful, while Number 6 notes that a fortune teller told him that he would live past 70. Number 6 puts on a bulletproof vest and proceeds with his plot to assassinate Yung. That afternoon, Number 6 masquerades as a window washer at an office building. He hangs outside an office where Yung is practicing putting golf balls. Yung pretends to ignore him. Yung's men then come into the room with flowers, and suddenly draw guns and shoot Number 6 many times. Number 6 is badly wounded but then bursts through the window and almost kills Yung before his men shoot Number 6 multiple times in the neck and face. Yung taunts the dead Number 6 and is enraged. He is hell bent on killing Ah-chai and disregards his step brother's request. Ah-chai receives the news that Number 6 is dead. He tells Wai-chui that it was due to Big Eye's betrayal, and he can hardly trust anyone besides her. Chai and Big Eye get in the car to go to the meeting with other gang leaders. The driver, Chuan, purposely causes a flat tire and they pull over. Ah-chai questions Big Eye about how Yung's men knew about Number 6's assassination plot. He says that Big Eye must've betrayed Number 6 to Yung since Number 6 is very tight lipped and he would only tell Ah-chai or Big Eye of his plans. Big Eye admits to his betrayal and Ah-chai shoots him in the arm. Big Eye explains that Ah-chai growing soft over the years has doomed them all and he was only trying to save himself from the same fate. Ah-chai realizes Big Eye is right and spares him. Big Eye attempts to get out of the car and is killed by the driver Chuan with a knife. Chai looks despondently at Big Eye sprawled against the window as he is sad to see his old friend die, but then is dismayed to realize, as Big Eye's body slumps down against the car, that Big Eye had pulled a gun and wanted to kill him even after Chai forgave Big Eye. Ah-chai goes to his meeting, but he realizes they've been betrayed, their plans having been tampered with the Big Eye. The other gangsters have all brought illegal weapons and now they hear police sirens coming to raid them. They are completely trapped and one of fellow gang leaders attempts to run to the car to get Ah-chai out of there. The gang leader is wounded badly and Ah-chai gathers all their weapons. He walks out to surrender to the police, claiming all the guns are his, and demand the police to get an ambulance there for the wounded. Ah-chai is driven away in police custody. Yung drives by the police car and taunts Ah-chai that he no longer has any allies on either side of the law. Ah-chai's wife Po-yee comes to the police station to visit Ah-chhai. Yung takes this opportunity and meets with her in one of the rooms. He then attempts to force himself onto her until she bites his lip and he backs off. He tells her that she was his woman and that he gave her to Ah-chai. After Ah-chai gets out of custody, he arranges a meeting with his longtime police ally to find out how his meeting got busted. Wai-chui is suspicious and lurks about outside the window with a gun. The police ally notes that Ah-chai is a nobody now and that everybody wants to bring Ah-chai down. They argue, with Chai threatening to testify against the corrupt policeman in court. He handcuffs himself to the wall and uses a blade to cut himself. Having staged what looks like an attack, he then shoots Ah- chai. Wai-chui shoots the police ally and then jumps in to check on Ah-chai. The police ally shoots Wai-chui in the back of the head and kills her. Ah- chai, in a fit of rage, gets up and shoots the police ally to death, not before taking 2 more bullets himself. He then escapes out the window to a boat with the help of Chuan as the police coming pouring in to shoot at Ah-chai. Ah-chai and his family escape to Malacca and visit Kwok. They reminisce about the past and he tells Kwok about Yung's actions. Ah-chai and Kwok seem content in Malacca until Yung decides he needs to finish the job. He sends assassins to Malacca to leave a bomb in the house. Ah-chai and Kwok are barbecuing away from the house. Kwok and Yung's father is lured away from the house to the airport. A bomb kills everyone inside, including Kwok's wife, his adopted children, and Ah-chai's family. Chai and Kwok are filled with anguish and swear revenge on Yung. Yung is then called into the police station in regards to the killings. Inspector Cheung (Danny lee) tells Yung that he is the number one target of the police. He then receives a phone call from Chai and dismisses Yung. Ah-chai apologizes for the way that he treated Inspector Cheung in the past, having arranged for his demotion to a faraway post. He praises Cheung for his principles and notes that Yung's lawyers will protect him too well from the justice system. Chai says he has returned to Hong Kong to destroy Yung, intending to go down together with him. He asks Cheung to keep the police out of the way and to take his body away when he's done. Inspector Cheung agrees. Meanwhile, Yung is celebrating now that he rules supreme. He has one of his lackeys keep tabs on his father in the event that Ah-chai and Kwok attempt revenge. His lackey reports that Yung's father has gone crazy, crying endlessly at his daughter's grave, sitting and mumbling for hours at the docks and has no contact with his step son, Kwok. Yung is anxious and asks whether his father has been seen cohorting with Ah-chai and Kwok. The lackey does not know. The father shows up and confronts Yung about whether he killed Ah-chai and Kwok's family in Malacca. Yung denies it and then lies to him that someone else did it. Another lackey then reports that Yung's father was seen in the same area as Ah-chai and Kwok. Yung is enraged that his father has openly betrayed him and admits to the killings. His father attacks him and Yung tells his lackeys to beat his father. The lackeys hesitate but do so and throw him out of the house. Yung's father gets in a waiting taxi. A lackey approaches the back of the car and is shot in the face. Ah-chai and Kwok jump out of the car and kill everybody in the vicinity. Chuan gets out and grabs a large of bag of heavy weaponry. They reach the mansion and it is quiet. Chuan goes out to inspect the pool area and is shot to death. A number of men show up and Ah-chai and Kwok are completely surrounded. They quickly pull out their heavy weaponry and blow up the mansion with grenades and rockets. They rush into the house and kill many of Yung's men. At one point, Ah-chai is wounded by Yung's right-hand man and they become trapped in the fire at the house. Yung kills his right-hand man for suggesting the idea of retreating. Yung has gone completely mad. He wounds Ah-chai more and has a gun pointed at his face. Kwok charges out and knocks Yung over. Yung attempts to shoot Ah-chai and Kwok takes the bullets and is seriously wounded. Again, Yung has Ah-chai at gunpoint and suddenly Yung's father appears and shoots Yung. Yung shoots his father down. Ah-chai gets up and beats up Yung to the point where Yung is now hanging onto the edge. Ah-chai taunts Yung and throws Yung into the fire below. Yung blows up due to all the ammunition he had strapped onto his vest. Ah-chai falls down in exhaustion and Inspector Cheung shows up to save them. Chai tells Cheung that he alone killed all those people, and that Kwok and Kwok's father are innocent onlookers. Cheung says he will try to help Kwok at trial. Ah-chai and Kwok are carried out on stretchers as the movie ends.

The Tasang dam's location will be northeast of Rangoon and west of Mongtong. The Tasang Dam will be the first dam on the Salween River and will be the largest hydroelectric dam in Myanmar and the tallest dam in Southeast Asia if completed. The Tasang will cost more than US$6 billion and is planned for completion in 2022. The groundbreaking ceremony was in March 2007, but construction has been stalled, and there has been little activity at the dam site as of 2008. Substantial domestic and international controversy surrounds the Tasang Dam project. The Tasang dam is one of five dams the Myanmar Government plans to build on the Salween River. Background Since the late 1990s, the Burmese Government proposed to build the Tasang dam but was unable to implement the construction plan until this decade because of civil unrest. Nippon Koei, a Japanese company conducted studies for the dam in 1981 and subsequent studies were done in 2002. Thailand's MDX Group agreed in 2002 to develop the project. Thailand is the main investor in the dam project and the trade of the TaSang's electricity is expected to help relations between Thailand and Burma. 85% of the hydro-electricity produced is expected to be transmitted to Thailand. Design The Tasang concrete-faced rockfill dam is designed to be 228 meters tall and house a hydro-power station with a 7,110 MW capacity to produce 35,446 GWh annually. Tasang's reservoir will bisect a large portion of Shan State, preluding serious social and environmental problems. Construction Construction on the dam is being led by the Thai MDX Group along with the China Gezhouba Group Co., Sinohydro Corporation, China Southern Power Grid Company, China Three Gorges Project Corporation and the British Malcolm Dunstan & Associates. The groundbreaking ceremony for the dam was in March 2007, but since the ceremony, actual construction of the dam has been stalled, and there has been little activity at the dam-site. Social Impact Since 1996, as many as 300,000 villagers, mostly Shan people have been displaced to make room for the Tasang Dam's reservoir. Thousands more relocations are expected as construction progresses. The dam's reservoir will dissect Shan State in half –almost to the Chinese border – and will negatively impact the local communities and ecosystems. Myanmar's Junta is responsible for the relocations and there have reports of serious human rights violations including executions.Mizzima News:Dam construction endangers lives of locals: report , August 5, 2009, Retrieved on April 28, 2011 References Category:Dams in Myanmar Category:Dam controversies Category:Proposed hydroelectric power stations Category:Salween River ","title":"Tasang Dam"},{"id":"21641419","text":"thumb Lambert Daneau (c. 1530 – c. 1590) was a French jurist and Calvinist theologian. Life He was born at Beaugency-sur-Loire, and educated at Orléans. He studied Greek under Adrianus Turnebus, and then law in Orléans from 1553. He moved to Bourges in 1559; he was particularly influenced by François Hotman, and by Anne du Bourg, who was executed in that year for heresy.Oliver Fatio, Lambert Daneau 1535-1590, p. 69 in rian P.

After eight fruitful further years in Geneva from 1572, he made a reputation as preacher and theological writer. He left for a position in the University of Leiden. He taught also in Ghent, Orthez, Lescar, and Castres.Donald K. McKim, David F. Wright, Encyclopedia of the Reformed Faith (1992), p. 95. Views Scott Manetsch describes Daneau as a \\"champion of Calvinist orthodoxy, with the expansive vision of expanding and extending the domains of secular knowledge... on the basis of Scripture through the use of the scholastic method of dialectic.\\" Daneau wrote on many subjects, including a commentary on Peter Lombard's Sentences, and a political treatise justifying armed resistance against tyranny. Daneau wrote a book on witchcraft, Dialogus de veneficiis (1564). His views on the topic of hunting witches caused trouble for him in Leiden.Bengt Ankarloo, Stuart Clark, William Monter, Witchcraft and Magic in Europe: The Period of the Witch Trials (2002), p. 81.

It is a part of the area covered by Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA). Liluah has a railway junction, which is the first station after Howrah station under the Eastern Railway (India). Its history dates back to the British era when the Liluah Carriage and wagon Workshop was set up to release pressure off Howrah. Location Liluah is located at at an elevation of 13 m from MSL. It is located between Salkia and Belur.Map and weather of Liluah Transportation Air Nearest airport is Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport in Dumdum, Kolkata. Road Liluah is well connected with round the clock buses and auto-rickshaws and toto also. Grand Trunk Road (part of State Highway 6), crosses through the eastern half of the town. The eastern half is well linked to the western half by a rail overbridge. It can also be accessed by Benaras road (the route followed by the Bhattanagar–Esplanade Minibus). Liluah can be accessed by Private Bus route number 51, 54 and 56. It can also be accessed by Minibuses on Satyabala-Ruby Hospital, Bally Khal-Khidirpur, Belur Math-Esplanade, Malipanchghara-Sealdah/Rajabazar, Bhattanagar-Esplanade and CSTC Bus (S32A) on Belgharia (Rathtala)-Howrah Station (via G.T. Road). =Inter-town road transportation= Auto-rickshaw, e-rickshaws as well as cycle-rickshaws are available for inter-town transport. Worth mentioning is that the western part of Liluah relies largely on autos and totos for public transportation, due to the absence any major bus route. Though the Bhattanagar-bound Minibus plys through that part, its frequency is quite low and its route goes through the southern fringes of western part (Gadadhar Bhatta Road, Jheel Road, A Road). As for the eastern part, large number of public buses ply along the G.T. Road throughout the day. Railway Liluah railway station is part of the Kolkata Suburban Railway. It also has a Railway Carriage and Wagons Workshop: one of the three in the Eastern Railways. The other two being at Kanchrapara and Jamalpur. The Liluah Railway station has 5 platforms with 3 mainly being used for the Howrah-Bardhaman main line and the other two for the Howrah-Bardhaman chord line. The Belur Math Line branches off between Liluah and Belur. There is also Bhattanagar railway station which is present at the extreme western outskirts of Liluah (in the farmlands of Chakpara, to the west of Bhattanagar locality). There is also a line connecting Liluah and Andul in the South Eastern Railways, used by Goods trains and few Express trains. It takes 8 minutes to travel from Howrah to Liluah (a distance of 5 km) by a suburban local train.cost of ticket is Rs.5 one-way. But the same journey takes 10 minutes when going from Liluah To Howrah due to bulk railway traffic coming in and out of Howrah station which is the oldest and biggest railway junction in India. Administration Liluah falls under the jurisdiction of Howrah Municipal Corporation since 10 July 2015. Before July 2015, Liluah was under the former Bally Municipality which was later merged with the HMC. There are two police stations in Liluah under Howrah City Police. All areas of Liluah west of the western side of Howrah- Bardhaman railway line (i.e. Howrah-Bardhaman chord line and Howrah-Bardhaman main line) fall under the Liluah Police Station, situated on the Liluah station road. It also has jurisdiction over some areas beyond the town, while the eastern part of Liluah was earlier under the Bally Police Station until 2013. After that, it came under the new Belur Police Station, which also has jurisdiction over some areas of Belur. It also has an outpost near Belur Math. It is located in The Liluah Railway Colony. There are two post offices in Liluah: in the eastern parts of the town Liluah Post Office PIN Code - 711204 and in the western parts of the town Liluah Shibtala Sub Post Office PIN Code - 711204 and Bhattanagar Post Office PIN Code - 711203, for the eastern and western parts of the town respectively. Some of the western parts of the town are also served by Belur Math Post Office. The town The railway line divides Liluah into 2 parts (eastern part and western part). Until 2008 these two halves were connected by a level crossing near the Liluah railway station, since 2008 both these parts were joined by a rail overbridge constructed above Liluah railway station. The town once used to be an industrial hub, with many small industrial units (mainly iron and steel rolling mills) dotting the small town due to its proximity to Howrah, an industrial city and Calcutta, being a major city of that time, a condition similar to any other suburb of Calcutta during the British Raj these industrial units dominated the locale of the town throughout the mid-20th century, when Liluah was known only for industries, factories and workshops. Since the mid 1990s many of the factories in the eastern and western parts of the town were gradually closed. They were gradually replaced by residential or commercial buildings. Until the first decade of the 21st century, most of the factories in the eastern halve of Liluah had disappeared and the eastern part of the town now a primarily commercial, residential and educational area, dominated by markets, shops, schools and malls. This part of Liluah has rapidly evolved since the last two decades, as you pass through G.T. Road from Howrah, you come across glittering shops and restaurants of 'Don Bosco Area' and RD Mall, further north, there is the century-old Liluah Railway Colony, made by the British in the first decade of the 20th century, this part has the 'four' big schools of Liluah (namely Don Bosco Liluah, M. C. Kejriwal Vidyapeeth, Agrasain Balika Siksha Sadan and Sudhir Memorial Institute Liluah). Although Liluah still has many industries remaining, but some are also being gradually replaced by residential buildings. History Liluah, or Lillooah as it was then written, was the depot of the former East Indian Railway [EIR]. The case of unfortunate shipwreck bringing EIR's first loco and mis-despatch of ship carrying EIR's first coaches for inauguration of first railroad in Eastern India led the E.I.R. authorities to consider manufacture of rolling stock in India (read the history of ER). Initially EIR had set up in 1853 a locomotive and carriage workshop near the Howrah Station (somewhere near the salt gola) with the idea of maintenance of assets after inauguration in 1854 and was later shifted to its present site in the year 1900 as the site did not meet the requirement in terms of magnitude of work. The locomotive portion was shifted to a new and much bigger workshop at Jamalpur in 1862 and the Howrah works was upgraded to a carriage and wagon workshop in 1863. As the Howrah location was found unsuitable for further expansion, the facility was finally shifted to its present site. The Liluah Carriage and Wagon Workshop is located in the suburbs of Howrah about 7 km. from Howrah. It is the largest combined carriage and wagon workshop of Indian Railways. The prime responsibility of this workshop was to manufacture rolling stock. This excluded locomotives. Only carriages and wagons were initially manufactured. During the last century Liluah had efficiently discharged the duties. Manufacturing of coaches were done till 1972, and Liluah has 3000 coaches to its credit. Wagon manufacturing was, however, discontinued in the post independence era, and coach manufacturing was also stopped when sufficient infrastructure was built throughout the country to cater for the ever-growing demand. Another interesting fact which is less known is that apart from rolling stock manufacture Liluah made immense contribution to the war machinery of Allied Forces during the Second World War. Apart from rolling stock required for transport of military equipment, Liluah also produced hundreds of Ambulances, Water Cars, tanks, armoured vehicles and lorries. Ammunitions were also produced for the British Army, the Indian Army and Royal Air force. Minor items like tent pegs etc. were also in thousands. All the above illustrates the technical expertise and skill developed within the workshop. An essay published in 1945 in East Indian Railway Magazine by D.K. Whitworthlogo of various railway divisions and workshops describes how great a job was done by railwaymen at Liluah between 1938 and 1942. Like other leading Indian railways, the EIR provided a full regiment for the Railway Units of the Auxiliary Force (India). Liluah, or Lillooah as it was written then, was the home of the 1st Bn., the East Indian Railway Regiment. Fateh Chand Badhwar OBE, MBE (Mil.) (1900–1995) the first Indian to become the chairman of the Railway Board had a stint at the Liluah Carriage and Wagon Workshop, during its early days. A township was planned near the workshop for the British officers, working in the workshop, which gradually, until 1913 became The Liluah Railway Colony. The roads in the colony still bear the names of the British engineers who worked in the workshop. Until the mid-1900s, Liluah had become a dusty industrial town. The Colony is commonly used by locals for their morning walks now. Post- independence, Liluah saw the development of many small industrial units and thus rapid expansion beyond the western half of the town, areas which were earlier farmlands, resulting in unplanned development. As a result of which, many people came to Liluah from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh as labourers in the small industrial units and gradually settled here; these people came to Kolkata in search of job opportunities, a condition experienced by all suburbs of Calcutta during the early post independence era; this resulted in significant ethical change in Liluah, which resulted in the majority Hindi- speaking population of Liluah since the late 1990s, in a contrast to the early 1990s, when most of the population was Bengali-speaking. Education The area of Eastern Liluah has been the educational hub of Howrah since the early 1990s, owing to a number of good n reputed schools, an Engineering College and a Science, Arts and Commerce College present there. Which contribute to it being the Educational hub having the highest concentration of Educational institutions in Howrah City. Schools The most famous and reputed of all institutions in Liluah is the Don Bosco High and Technical School Liluah or Don Bosco Liluah (abbreviated as DBL) which was established in the year 1937 as a Catholic institution by the Salesians of Don Bosco, along with the Agrasain Balika Siksha Sadan (ABSS) and the M.C. Kejriwal Vidyapeeth an institution run and operated by the MCKV group of Institutions, the group which also runs the MCKV Institute of Engineering. These three schools comprise the THREE BIG schools of Liluah, often seen as competitors. Apart from these three schools, the Sohanlal Deoralia Balika Siksha Sadan, established in the year 1962 is one of the oldest n most reputed girls educational institution in Howrah, with the medium of instruction there primarily being Hindi. Apart from these, the Sunrise Eng. Med. School, which was established in the year 1975, run and operated by the Sunrise Society, the I.P. Memorial School and the Rosebud School, both established in 1967 are also some of the oldest n most reputed institutions in Liluah. Sudhir Memorial Institute Liluah(SMIL), Little Wits (Pre-Primary Segment of Sudhir Memorial Institute Liluah) established in 2011 is another reputed CBSE School run and operated by SNR MEMORIAL TRUST, this school is also one of the competitors along with (MCKV,ABSS,DBL). Other schools like the Agrasain Boys' School the Bharatiya Higher School and the Gurukul School are all located within a radius of less than 2 kilometers within the 'Don Bosco Area' (Abhay Guha Road Commercial Area) of Eastern Liluah. The Florence Day School (Privately run), The Eastern Railway Hindi High School and the Eastern Railway Bengali High School are Central Government schools under the Ministry of Railways, affiliated to the CBSE, present in the Liluah Railway Colony. Apart from these, institutions like the Holy Family Convent School, Swaika Girls High School, Liluah T.R.G.R. Khemka High School and the Bhattanagar Kulokamini Vidyamandir are located in western Liluah. Apart from these schools, the Mirpara Don Bosco Self Employment Research Institute (D.B.S.E.R.I) is also located in Western Liluah, which is an institution also run by the Salesians of DonBosco and it provides training in various Self-Employment skills to people. Motion Howrah which is a renowned institutions which provides Engineering and Medical exams classes and also conducts MTSE (National level test), other than this also provides classes for cracking WBJEE, JEE (MAIN+ ADVANCE), KVPY, NTSE etc. is also located in eastern liluah on the side of G.T. Road. It is also operated by the same management which operates Sudhir Memorial Institute Liluah. Other schools like the Belur Janta High School, the Belur Boys School, Belur Girls school and the Belur High School are located within half a kilometer off Liluah. Apart from that there are around a dozen more registered and unregistered primary schools in Liluah. Don Bosco High and Technical School Liluah *Don Bosco High and Technical School Liluah. Commonly abbreviated as DBL, was set up in 1937 by the salesians of Don Bosco mainly to train the local Christian population so that they could get jobs at the Liluah Railway Carriage and Wagon Workshop. The school has won the Telegraph School of the Year awards three times and is only the fourth school ever in Kolkata to enter the Hall of Fame. DBL celebrated its Platinum Jubilee on 8 December 2012, a lavish event which had eminent personalities from around India(many of its Alumni) visiting the school, including former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. *Agrasain Balika Siksha Sadan is a girls school, affiliated to the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE Board).

The rectangular fort was built in 1634-36 by Jakub Sobieski using the labor of enslaved Crimean Tatars. The Sobieski castle comprised solid walls in a then-current Dutch style, with four pentagonal towers at each corner, and the so-called \\"grand palace\\". The Chinese Palace, a diminutive mauve-colored rotunda flanked by one-storey wings, was added later in the century as John III's gift to his French-born wife, Queen Marie. In 1672, the castle was taken after a 6-days siege by the Turks under Kapudan Pasa. Three years later, it survived a new siege by the Ottoman army. After Jakub Ludwik Sobieski's death in 1737, the castle passed to the Radziwiłł princely family and then (in 1801) to Count Łukasz Komarnicki-Pawlikowicz (of the House of Sas), whose heirs sold it to the Austrian crown in 1834. In the 19th century, the castle was adapted for use as a hospital and barracks. It was turned into a prison in 1872 and continued in use after the September Campaign. There's a chapel commemorating the victims of the NKVD on the grounds of the castle. Since 1985, the complex has been supervised by the Lviv Art Gallery and under restoration. Recently it began to open its grounds for visitors.

Investigating methods of sterilisation of the surgeon's hands resulted in his invention of a type of rubber glove that was widely adopted by his medical colleagues. World War I required him to fight with the German army and he successfully brought a typhus epidemic in a Prisoner of War camp under control by delousing 10.000 Russian POWs in a few days. He was awarded the Iron Cross and received decorations from several other countries. After the war, Blumberg resumed his surgical practice and organised many prenatal care clinics in Berlin, one of which was the Beulah Clinic which Blumberg personally directed. He also began working in the new fields of radiology and radium therapy and founded an X-ray and radium institute in Berlin. With the rise of the Nazi Party he left Germany and moved to Belsize Park, London, England where he successfully continued his medical work and where his portrait was painted by the renowned artist Arthur Pan.

It formed on January 18, 2009 in the Mozambique Channel, and rapidly organized as it remained nearly stationary. Fanele ultimately turned toward the southwest Madagascar coastline, reaching peak winds of 185 km/h (115 mph), according to the Réunion Météo-France office (MFR). It weakened before moving ashore in Menabe Region southwest of Morondava, and rapidly weakened over land. Fanele briefly re-intensified after reaching open waters, only to become an extratropical cyclone by January 23\\\\. The cyclone caused heavy damage near where it moved ashore and along its path, resulting in ten deaths. Fanele struck Madagascar just two days after Tropical Storm Eric brushed the northeastern portion of the country. The two storms affected over 50,000 people, of which at least 4,000 were left homeless. Fanele struck the country during a series of government protests, and consequentially relief efforts were hindered. Meteorological history For several days in the middle of January 2009, a very weak low-level circulation persisted in the Mozambique Channel, accompanied by intermittent and disorganized convection, or thunderstorms. By January 17, an area of convection persisted about west- southwest of Antananarivo, Madagascar. Early on January 18; the circulation rapidly consolidated and organized while the thunderstorms developed into tightly-curved rainbands. Environmental conditions favored further development; an anticyclone formed over the disturbance, an approaching trough provided favorable outflow, and the system benefited from both light wind shear and warm water temperatures. At 0600 UTC on the 18th, the Réunion Météo- France office (MFR) initiated advisories on Tropical Disturbance 07, noting its intensification as it drifted southwestward. Six hours after being declared a tropical disturbance, MFR upgraded it to tropical depression status, and the agency predicted the system would eventually reach peak winds of 130 km/h (80 mph) before moving ashore. Its track was expected to follow that of another tropical cyclone east of Madagascar, which would become Tropical Storm Eric. Late on January 18, the system briefly became disorganized, only to re-organize and attain tropical storm status on January 19; upon doing so, the Malagasy Weather Service named it Fanele. Around the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began issuing advisories on the storm. The agency noted uncertainty in the future track of the storm, due to interaction with Tropical Storm Eric east of Madagascar, and Fanele was located within an area of weak steering currents. Tropical Storm Fanele quickly strengthened, developing an eye feature, and late on January 19 the JTWC estimated sustained winds of 120 km/h (75 mph); the agency predicted further strengthening to peak winds of 140 km/h (85 mph). Around that time, Fanele began rapid deepening under very favorable environmental conditions, and the MFR upgraded the storm to tropical cyclone status with winds of 150 km/h (95 mph). Upon attaining tropical cyclone status, the MFR forecast Fanele would intensify further to peak winds of 185 km/h (115 mph). Early on January 20, Cyclone Fanele began a northeast motion, tracking along the eastern periphery of a ridge located over Mozambique. Later it turned southeastward under the influence of another ridge further to the east. The thunderstorms organized further around the eye, and at 1200 UTC on January 20 the MFR estimated Fanele attained peak winds of 185 km/h (115 mph) about west- northwest of Morondava along the Madagascar coast. At the same time, its atmospheric pressure was estimated at 927 hPa (mbar), and peak wind gusts were estimated at 261 km/h (162 mph). The JTWC also assessed peak winds of 185 km/h (115 mph). As it approached the coast, the cyclone became slightly less organized, with weaker convection and a less distinct eye; the weakening was due to an eyewall replacement cycle. At around 0215 UTC on January 21, Fanele made landfall on the western Madagascar coastline, to the southwest of Morondava. Cyclone Fanele weakened quickly over land; within four hours of moving ashore, its winds decreased to 150 km/h (95 mph), and its wind field expanded. The eye feature dissipated as the system weakened to tropical storm status, and increased wind shear contributed to further weakening. By January 22, the poorly defined circulation moved over open waters, by which time its winds weakened to about 45 km/h (30 mph). Upon reaching the ocean, convection began to reform near the circulation, and Fanele re-attained tropical storm status. Cooler waters caused convection diminish near the center, which began the process of extratropical transition. Late on January 22, the JTWC issued its last advisory on the storm. By January 23, Fanele completed the transition into an extratropical storm as it accelerated toward the south-southeast. It persisted as a distinct tropical cyclone until later that day. Impact Cyclone Fanele two days before landfall; Moderate Tropical Storm Eric, to the northeast, is also skirting Madagascar Though the cyclone developed quickly, authorities were prepared for the storm; earlier in the year, Madagascar's National Office for Natural Disasters Preparedness implemented a plan for localized storm warning. Officials deployed warnings via radio to citizens in the path of Fanele, as well as to fishermen who were told to avoid leaving port. Cyclone Fanele made landfall on western Madagascar in Menabe Region, where it destroyed many buildings, flooded large areas, and left thousands of people isolated. In the city of Morondava near the landfall location, the cyclone flooded 80% of buildings and damaged about half of the houses, leaving 3,000 people homeless. Throughout the region, the winds damaged 158 classrooms attended by 9,000 children. Further inland, the cyclone damaged bridges and roads, leaving some areas isolated. The outer rainbands of the storm produced heavy rainfall in the northwest portion of the country, resulting in flooding that left about 250 people homeless in Sofia Region. The passages of Cyclones Eric and Fanele affected 54,802 people, leaving 4,102 without shelter. At least 28,000 people were affected directly by Fanele, and the cyclone killed a total of ten people. The cyclone disrupted work to rebuild areas that were affected by Cyclone Ivan in February 2008. Cyclone Fanele struck the country during a series of government protests, and consequently the national government provided little response to the storm. Instead, United Nations (UN) agencies quickly provided relief to affected citizens. The World Food Programme prepared 87 metric tons (MT) of cereal and 13 MT of various types of pulses. Five United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) trucks arrived in Morondova on January 25 with various supplies. In the days after the storm, contaminated floodwaters resulted in cases of dysentery. To prevent the spread of disease, UNICEF provided vaccines, de-worming tablets, and water cleaning devices. Within three days of the storm's landfall, the agency also began distributing health kits and bed nets. As many schools were affected, UNICEF set up temporary classrooms in tents, while workers began fixing and cleaning the damaged buildings. Despite the quick response by the UN, thousands of people were left without aid. The Malagasy Red Cross deployed its volunteers to affected areas, although disrupted transportation services and the political situation hindered relief efforts.

An initial slowdown in economic growth amid the international financial crisis of 2007–08 greatly intensified in late 2008 and the country fell into recession for the first time since the 1980s. Emigration, as did unemployment (particularly in the construction sector), escalated to levels not seen since that decade. The Irish Stock Exchange (ISEQ) general index, which reached a peak of 10,000 points briefly in April 2007, fell to 1,987 points—a 14-year low—on 24 February 2009 (the last time it was under 2,000 being mid-1995). In September 2008, the Irish government—a Fianna Fáil-Green coalition—officially acknowledged the country's descent into recession; a massive jump in unemployment occurred in the following months. Ireland was the first state in the eurozone to enter recession, as declared by the Central Statistics Office (CSO). By January 2009, the number of people living on unemployment benefits had risen to 326,000—the highest monthly level since records began in 1967—and the unemployment rate rose from 6.5% in July 2008 to 14.8% in July 2012. The slumping economy drew 100,000 demonstrators onto the streets of Dublin on 21 February 2009, amid further talk of protests and industrial action. With the banks \\"guaranteed\\", and the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) established on the evening of 21 November 2010, then Taoiseach Brian Cowen confirmed on live television that the EU/ECB/IMF troika would be involving itself in Ireland's financial affairs. Support for the Fianna Fáil party, dominant for much of the previous century, then crumbled; in an unprecedented event in the nation's history, it fell to third place in an opinion poll conducted by The Irish Times—placing behind Fine Gael and the Labour Party, the latter rising above Fianna Fáil for the first time. On 22 November, the Greens called for an election the following year. The 2011 general election replaced the ruling coalition with another one, between Fine Gael and Labour. This coalition continued with the same austerity policies of the previous coalition, as the country's larger parties all favour a similar agenda, but subsequently lost power in the 2016 General Election. Official statistics showed a drop in most crimes coinciding with the economic downturn. Burglaries, however, rose by approximately 10% and recorded prostitution offences more than doubled from 2009 to 2010. In late 2014 the unemployment rate was 11.0% on the seasonally adjusted measure, still over double the lows of the mid-2000s but down from a peak of 15.1% in early 2012. By May 2016, this figure had fallen to 7.8%, and had returned to a pre-downturn level of 4.5% by June 2019https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/er/mue/monthlyunemploymentjune2019/ Background and causes The economy of the Republic of Ireland expanded rapidly during the Celtic Tiger years (1995–2007) due to a low corporate tax rate, low ECB interest rates, and other systemic factors (such as soft surveillance of banking supervision including against observance of Basel Core Principles, underdeveloped public financial management and anti-corruption systems and adoption of poor policies including a corporate tax system that fostered non-tradable goods and services through the construction industry). At the end of the third quarter of 2010, German banks had between US$186.4 billion and $208.3 billion in total exposure to Ireland with $57.8 billion in exposure to Irish banks. This led to an expansion of credit and a property bubble which petered out in 2007. Irish banks, already over-exposed to the Irish property market, came under severe pressure in September 2008 due to the global financial crisis of 2007–08. The foreign borrowings of Irish banks rose from €15 billion to €110 billion in 2004–08. Much of this was borrowed on a three-month rollover basis to fund building projects that would not be sold for several years. When the properties could not be sold due to oversupply, the result was a classic asset–liability mismatch. At the time of the bank guarantee the banks were said to be illiquid (but not insolvent) by €4 billion; this turned out to be an enormous underestimate. Impact The economy and government finances began to show signs of impending recession by the end of 2007 when tax revenues fell short of the 2007 annual budget forecast by €2.3 billion (5%), with stamp duties and income tax both falling short by €0.8 billion (19% and 5%) resulting in the 2007 general government budget surplus of €2.3 billion (1.2% of GDP) being wiped out. An imminent recession became clear by mid-2008. Subsequently, government deficits increased, many businesses closed and unemployment increased. The Irish Stock Exchange (ISEQ) fell and many immigrant workers left. Anglo Irish Bank Anglo Irish Bank was exposed to the Irish property bubble. A hidden loans controversy in December 2008 led to a further drop in its share price. The ISEQ dropped to a 14-year low on 24 September 2009, probably triggered by the unexpected resignation of former Anglo Irish Bank director Anne Heraty from the board of the Irish Stock Exchange the night before. Property market Due to the ending of the bubble, the residential and commercial property markets went into a severe slump with both sales and property values collapsing. Developers such as Liam Carroll began to fall behind on their loan repayments. Due to the financial crisis, banks such as ACC pushed for their revenue recovery and requested liquidation of the development firms. A 'ghost estate' in Ireland Economy The Irish economy entered severe recession in 2008, and then entered into an economic depression in 2009. The Economic and Social Research Institute predicted an economic contraction of 14% by 2010. In the first quarter in 2009, GDP was down 8.5% from the same quarter the previous year, and GNP down 12%. Unemployment rose from 8.75% to 11.4%. The economy exited recession in the third quarter of 2009, with GDP growing by 0.3% in the quarter, but GNP continued to contract, by 1.4%. The economy grew by 1.9% in Q1 and by 1.6% in Q2 of 2011 but contracted by 1.9% in Q3. Unemployment The unemployment rate rose from 4.2% in 2007 to reach 14.6% in February 2012.CSO figures reveal unemployment levels - Inside Ireland, 7 March 2012 Emigration The Central Statistics Office estimated that 34,500 people left the country from April 2009 to 2010, the largest net emigration since 1989. However, only 27,700 of these are Irish nationals, an increase of 12,400 since 2006. It's also notable that more people went somewhere other than the UK, EU or US, traditional destinations for Irish emigrants. Downturn 2008: Cowen government 160px Following the May 2008 appointment of Brian Cowen as Taoiseach, the ruling Fianna Fáil party had been polling close to their 41% levels of the 2007 election but the party began to fall in the polls from September 2008. Their support fell to third place for the first time ever behind both leading opposition parties in a national opinion poll published in The Irish Times on 13 February 2009, polling only 22%. A 27 February poll, indicated that only 10% of voters were satisfied with the Government's performance, that over 50% would like an immediate general election. They gained about 24% of the vote in the June 2009 local elections and continued to languish as the crisis intensified during the remainder of the year, reaching a new low of 17% support in September 2009. During the 2009/2010 period opposition calls for an early election intensified and some of their own TDs resigned from the party supporting the calls and reducing the Government majority to single digits. The Government was urged by the courts to hold a long-delayed Donegal South by-election. By December 2010, following the IMF intervention, their support reached a further record low of 13% and their coalition partners, the Green Party, announced that they would withdraw support from Government in January 2011 once the 2011 budget had been passed. The Government announced that an election would take place in Spring 2011 but the intended date had to be brought forward to 25 February 2011 following a widely criticised cabinet reshuffle. Taoiseach Cowen was replaced as party leader by Micheál Martin. At the election, Fianna Fáil received 17% of the vote and their seats collapsed from 71 outgoing to a record low of 20. The Fine Gael and Labour opposition secured record seat gains but no overall majority and formed a coalition government. =Government emergency budget of October 2008= Ireland officially declared it was in a recession in September 2008. Before this declaration, the Irish government announced, on 3 September 2008, that it would bring forward the 2009 government budget from its usual December date to 14 October 2008. In a statement, the government claimed that this was largely due to a decrease in the global economy. The budget, labelled \\"the toughest in many years\\", included a number of controversial measures such as a proposed income levy which was eventually restructured, and the withdrawal of previously promised HPV vaccines for schoolgirls. Other results of the budget included a new income levy being imposed on all workers above a specified threshold and the closure of a number of military barracks near the border with Northern Ireland. An unexpected public outcry was invoked over the proposed withdrawal of medical cards and the threatened return of university fees. A series of demonstrations ensued amongst teachers and farmers, whilst on 22 October 2008, at least 25,000 pensioners and students descended in solidarity on the Irish parliament at Leinster House, Kildare Street, Dublin. Some of the pensioners were even seen to cheer on the students as the protests passed each other on the streets of Dublin. Changes to education led to a ministerial meeting with three Church of Ireland bishops who were assured by O'Keeffe that religious instruction would be unaffected by the budget changes. Rebellion within the ranks of the ruling coalition government led to a number of defections of disenchanted coalition members. County Wicklow TD, Joe Behan resigned from the Fianna Fáil party in protests at the proposed medical card changes after suggesting that past taoisigh Éamon de Valera and Seán Lemass \\"would be turning in their graves at the decisions made in the past week\\". Independent Deputy Finian McGrath then threatened to withdraw his support for the government unless the plan to remove the overs 70s automatic right to a medical card was withdrawn completely. Taoiseach Brian Cowen postponed a planned trip to China, sending Minister for Education and Science Batt O'Keeffe ahead to lead the delegation. Behan, alongside McGrath and former government minister Jim McDaid, later voted against his former colleagues in two crucial Dáil votes on medical cards and cancer vaccines. These defections reduced the Irish government's majority of twelve by one quarter. A supplementary budget was delivered in April 2009 to address a fiscal shortfall of over €4.5 billion. =Bank guarantee= On 29 September 2008 the government issued a 2-year unlimited guarantee of all debt (the Credit Institutions Financial Stabilisation Act, or CIFS guarantee) in favour of 6 banks.NTMA about the 2008 bank guarantee It was approved at the time by the European Commission. The CIFS \\"blanket guarantee\\" of Irish domestic banks covered debts estimated at around €440 billion at the start. It covered all debts of the 6 banks protected, was non-renewable, and was never called on. As such, the guarantee itself did not directly cost the State anything—and since the protected banks paid levies in exchange, it can technically be described as having made money. However, preventing the guarantee from being called on committed the Irish government to preventing the collapse of any of the participating banks, which would have resulted in the calling on of the guarantee at a time when the banks had large debts, bank assets were of little value for lack of buyers, and the government's finances were already under heavy strain. The CIFS blanket guarantee was never renewed. An ancillary guarantee, the Eligible Liabilities Guarantee, was passed in 2009. This second guarantee scheme applied only to specified new debt (but applied to that debt until maturity), and was renewable on a six-monthly basis. It is this second guarantee that was renewed several times after the expiry of the CIFS guarantee. =Comment by the American embassy= Despite the bank guarantee in September, by December 2008 the American ambassador was reporting to Washington that no clear plan was in place, after an interview with John McCarthy of the Irish Department of Finance and two other officials. McCarthy was quoted as saying that \\"forecasting anything in the current uncertain environment is almost impossible\\" and that the government could \\"only react given the fast pace of the downturn\\". The interview was published in 2011 as a part of the WikiLeaks disclosures. 2009: NAMA, strikes and industrial unrest Workers march through Dublin against the government's response to the financial crisis, 2009 =Sit-ins and strikes= On 5 January 2009, Waterford Wedgwood entered receivership. On 30 January, workers at the Waterford Crystal plant in Kilbarry were told they would be losing their jobs. A statement issued by the receiver, Deloitte's David Carson, confirmed that, of the 670 employees, 480 of them would be laid off. The workers responded angrily to this unexpected decision and at least 100 of them began an unofficial sit-in in the visitors' gallery at the factory that night. They insisted they would refuse to leave until they had met with Carson. Following the revelations, there was a minor scuffle during which the main door to the visitors' centre was damaged. Local Sinn Féin Councillor Joe Kelly was amongst those who occupied the visitors' gallery. A meeting held the following day did little to resolve the conflict, with the sit-in continuing for almost two months until 22 March. On 18 February 2009, 13,000 civil servants voted for industrial action over a proposed pension levy. They effected this action on 26 February. Days earlier, as many as 120,000 people, had protested on the streets of Dublin on 21 February. This was followed by a further march through the capital by gardaí on 25 February and a lunch-time protest by 10,000 civil servants on 19 March 2009. This was followed by two separate taxi drivers' protests in Dublin on 20 March 2009. Labour leader Eamon Gilmore said at the time that a national strike would serve the country no good. =National Asset Management Agency= In April 2009, the government proposed a National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) to take over large loans from the banks, enabling them to return to normal liquidity to assist in the economic recovery. NAMA's first appraisal was in September 2009, fortuitously timed just before the issue of the second one-year bank guarantee. =Increasing debt spiral= The costs of the bank rescues, NAMA and government deficits over the period look set to push Irish National Debt up to a ratio of 125% of GDP by 2015.\\"The euro area's debt crisis - Bite the bullet\\"'The Economist' London, 13 January 2010 However, there have been a number of misleading estimates of debt statistics relating to the Irish financial crisis. Ireland, like Luxembourg, is home to a disproportionately large number of international financial services providers. Many statistical calculations include the debts of all banks located in Ireland without separating foreign owned banks from Irish banks. The liabilities of the Irish banks represent a figure equivalent to approximately 309% of GDP, the third highest in the EU.\\"Irish Banking Liabilities\\" Davy Stockbrokers Dublin, 17 February 2009 =Croke Park Agreement= The Irish Government and Irish Public Sector unions, including IMPACT, negotiated the Croke Park Agreement which provided for increased productivity, flexibility and savings from the public sector in exchange for no further pay cuts, and no lay offs. 2010: Bank bail-outs and protests Joe Higgins, MEP, speaking during 2010 banking crisis protest against bailout of Anglo Irish Bank, Dublin =Economic Adjustment Programme for Ireland= In April 2010, following a marked increase in Irish 2-year bond yields, Ireland's NTMA state debt agency said that it had \\"no major refinancing obligations\\" in 2010. Its requirement for in 2010 was matched by a cash balance, and it remarked: \\"We're very comfortably circumstanced\\".The Irish Times, 28 April 2010, p.18. On 18 May the NTMA tested the market and sold a €1.5 billion issue that was three times oversubscribed.Irish Times, 19 May 2010, p.15. By September 2010 the banks could not raise finance and the bank guarantee was renewed for a third year. This had a negative impact on Irish government bonds, government help for the banks rose to 32% of GDP, and so the government started negotiations with the ECB and the IMF. On the evening of 21 November 2010, the then Taoiseach Brian Cowen confirmed that Ireland had formally requested financial support from the European Union's European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a request which was welcomed by the European Central Bank and EU finance ministers. The request was approved in principle by the finance ministers of the eurozone countries in a telephone conference call. Details of the financial arrangement were not immediately agreed upon, and remained to be determined in the following weeks, though the loan was believed to be in the region of €100 billion, of which approximately €8 billion was expected to be provided by the United Kingdom. Following criticism of the action, the Green Party leader John Gormley signalled that his party would seek a General Election in January 2011, with the implicit threat being that they would pull out of Government; with the addition of a number of Independent government TDs declaring that they would not continue to support the Government and speculation mounting, Brian Cowen called a press conference in which he announced that the Government intended to introduce and pass that year's Budget, and its constituent parliamentary bills, before having the 2011 election. However, on 23 November, rebel members of Brian Cowen's ruling Fianna Fáil party and opposition leaders sought no-confidence vote for the Government and dissolution of the Oireachtas before a crucial budget vote on 7 December 2010, that should open the way for adopting the rescue package. On 28 November, the European Union, International Monetary Fund and the Irish state agreed to an €85 billion rescue deal made up of €22.5 billion from the IMF, €22.5 billion from the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), €17.5 billion from the Irish sovereign National Pension Reserve Fund (NPRF) and bilateral loans from the United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden. Eurogroup President Jean-Claude Juncker said that the deal includes €10 billion for bank recapitalisation, €25 billion for banking contingencies and €50 billion for financing the budget. =Protests against austerity= 2010 saw several notable protests against austerity in Ireland. 2011: Government collapse =Collapse of the Cowen government= On 6 February 2011, it was revealed that Ireland had received a first €3.6 billion of the rescue package from the EFSF. This is a slightly higher amount than was previously expected mostly due to the better than expected auction of the EFSF bonds in January 2011. Later that month the coalition government of Fianna Fáil and the Green Party lost the 2011 general election and were replaced by a coalition made up of Fine Gael and the Labour Party. In April 2011, despite all the measures taken, Moody's downgraded the Irish banks' debt to junk status. Debate continues on whether the new government will need a \\"second bailout\\". By August 2011 the largest of the six state-guaranteed banks, Bank of Ireland, had a market capitalisation of €2.86 billion, but loans to the six by the ECB and the Irish Central Bank were about €150 billion. Consumer research by British discount retailer Poundland found that the term \\"eurozone\\" had negative associations. When expanding to the Republic in 2011 the company branded its stores as \\"Dealz\\", despite the CEO stating that \\"Euroland\\" would be \\"the obvious choice\\". =Student actions= As the year went on students became increasingly concerned about the honesty and integrity of the pledge signed by Ruairi Quinn before the election that the Labour Party would oppose increased tuition fees. On 16 November 2011, thousands of students, their parents and families, descended on Dublin from around the country and marched on Government Buildings amid concerns about the reintroduction of third-level fees. A small group also engaged in a sit-down protest outside the Fine Gael office on Dublin's Upper Mount Street. At around 16:00 on 29 November 2011, three student union presidents (of Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, University College Cork and IT Carlow) under the leadership of Union of Students in Ireland (USI) President Gary Redmond occupied a room at Department of Social Protection on Dublin's Store Street as part of a continued effort to have the Labour Party clarify its position on tuition fees. Police broke down the door of the room in which they were stationed and led them away. The students came armed with a chemical toilet and supplies of food that could have lasted them weeks. Ten student union presidents also attempted to occupy a room at the Department of Enterprise on Kildare Street for the same reasons. Nine students, also seeking clarification on the government's view on third- level fees, participated in a peaceful sit-down protest by occupying the constituency office of Fine Gael TD and former mayor Brian Walsh in Bohermore, Galway, around midday on 30 November 2011. They unfurled a banner on the roof with the message, \\"FREE EDUCATION NOTHING LESS\\". They were imprisoned by the police and released a short time later. On 2 December 2011, eight students from the National University of Ireland, Maynooth (NUIM), including the university's student union president Rob Munnelly, began occupying the Naas constituency office of Fine Gael TD Anthony Lawlor. They did so with sleeping bags, clothes, a chemical toilet and a week's supply of food and were supported by other students on Facebook and Twitter. During the occupation Munnelly debated with Lawlor live on Kildare TV, USI President Gary Redmond visited the revolting students and a banner with the slogan \\"SAVE THE GRANT\\" was erected at Lawlor's entrance. =Other protest actions= Occupy Dame Street outside Leinster House on 6 December 2011 The closure of the Accident & Emergency Department at Roscommon hospital led to continued protests by the Roscommon Hospital Action Committee. Occupy Dame Street began on 8 October 2011, a Saturday afternoon. On 26 November 2011, thousands of people marched against austerity in Dublin. On 1 December 2011, Roscrea District Court solicitors staged a walkout over the courthouse's closure. Hundreds of people from County Donegal converged on Buncrana on 3 December 2011 to protest against austerity and to tell the government that \\"Inishowen and Donegal says no to further cuts and austerity\\". The Vita Cortex sit-in began in Cork on 16 December 2011. There was also rebellion within the ranks of government. On 15 November 2011, Willie Penrose resigned as Minister of State for Housing and Planning due to his opposition to the Government's decision to close the army barracks in Mullingar. He also resigned the Labour parliamentary party whip. Tommy Broughan TD was expelled from the Labour Party on 1 December 2011 after voting to reject a government amendment to extend the bank guarantee for another year. Later that month, Patrick Nulty, another Labour TD, also voted against the government. 2012: Occupy and Fiscal referendum In January 2012, Taoiseach Enda Kenny denied Ireland would need a second bailout but admitted \\"very significant economic challenges\\" were ahead. =Industrial action= The Vita Cortex sit-in continued in Cork. On 27 March, 2,104 jobs were lost as video games retail company Game closed 277 stores. Staff began a sit-in. =Occupy= The Occupy Dame Street camp in Dublin. Occupy Dame Street continued in Dublin. In January, Occupy Cork occupied a building in the city, while Occupy Belfast took over the Bank of Ireland in the city. =Protests= While attending a buffet at a Letterkenny hotel on 24 February 2012, Transport Minister Leo Varadkar was heckled and booed by local residents who repeatedly shouted \\"Shame on you\\" at him. On 25 February 2012, demonstrators protesting against the downgrading of schools in Bunbeg, County Donegal, marched on the office of their local TD, Fine Gael Junior Minister Dinny McGinley. There were also protests in County Mayo on the same day. On 31 March, Ireland was reported by international media to be facing a popular revolt after government figures indicated less than half of the country's households had paid the new property tax by that day's deadline as thousands of people from across the country marched on the governing Fine Gael party's Ard Fheis at the Convention Centre Dublin. The previous evening, Justice minister Alan Shatter was involved in controversy after telling those who objected to the government's Household Charge to \\"get a life\\", remarks made on his way into the Fine Gael annual conference at the Convention Centre. In April 2012, the ruling Labour Party held its centenary conference in the Bailey Allen Hall at NUI Galway. Gardaí used pepper spray to hold back anti- austerity demonstrators after they broke through a Garda barrier while protesting against government. In October 2012, the ministerial car of Tánaiste Eamon Gilmore was subjected to eggings and kickings by protesters against cuts in Dublin. =Referendum on Fiscal Stability Treaty= In 2012 the government sought to ratify the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union. The Attorney General advised that a referendum was required to ensure consistency with the constitution. Consequently, the Thirtieth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland was passed on 31 May with 60.3% in favour on a turnout of 50%. This enshrined the Fiscal Treaty into Article 29 of the constitution. 2013: IBRC and bailout exit =Liquidation of IBRC= Logo of IBRC On the night of 6–7 February 2013, the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC) was dramatically liquidated after the Fine Gael/Labour coalition passed emergency overnight legislation through the Oireachtas while President Michael D. Higgins was flown home from the three-day official visit to Italy upon which he had embarked that very morning. This was the night before the Irish Supreme Court was due to hear an appeal by a Dublin business man, David Hall, against the High Court's ruling that he did not have the standing or locus standi to challenge the legality of the €3.06 billion promissory note payment that was due at the end of March. Hall's original argument before the High Court was that the payment of the €31 billion in promissory notes in respect of the now defunct Anglo Irish Bank was illegal as their issuing in 2010 was not approved by a Dáil vote. Every IBRC employee had their employment terminated with immediate effect, with many learning of this as it was announced on national television station TV3. Dáil Éireann was called into session for 22:30 on 6 February 2013. The Opposition did not have a copy of the proposed legislation to debate with five minutes before this. They had received copies by 22:32 and the Dáil session was then delayed until 23:00. Fine Gael TD Jerry Buttimer tweeted a photo of the Bill at 22:35. Minister Michael Noonan blamed the rush on a leak to foreign media. Ursula Halligan said on TV3 that the \\"leak came from Frankfurt's end\\". The proposed legislation eventually passed in the Dáil by 113 to 35 at 03:00. In Seanad Éireann it passed by 38 to 6. President Michael D. Higgins rushed home from his visit to Rome and signed the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Bill 2013 into law at Áras an Uachtaráin early on 7 February 2013. The Opposition criticised the suddenness with which the legislation was rushed through. Many deputies did not have time to read it. The range of opposition TDs critical of it included Joe Higgins, Catherine Murphy, Richard Boyd Barrett, Luke 'Ming' Flanagan, Mick Wallace, Thomas Pringle and Mattie McGrath. According to Independent TD Stephen Donnelly in a speech addressed to Minister Noonan in the chamber, Donnelly also warned that Section 17 of the Bill \\"could be ruled unconstitutional\\" and described the Bill and the manner of its attempted introduction as \\"very, very dangerous\\" and \\"a fundamental erosion of parliamentary democracy.\\" He suggested that Noonan withdraw the bill and return to the Dáil \\"before the courts open for business in the morning, with the minimal legislation needed to protect state assets.\\" Ireland's mainstream media overwhelmingly supported the legislation, though Vincent Browne called it \\"lunatic stuff\\" on TV3. On 7 February, RTÉ lunchtime newsreader Sean O'Rourke described it as a \\"breakthrough in Ireland's attempt to lift the debt burden\\". The 8 February edition of The Irish Times contained a section dedicated to the issue, which was described as resembling \\"a press release from the Department of Finance\\". Much of the media focused on the funny little tweets which members of the public contributed to the #promnight hashtag, with some saying they had, in common with many of the politicians in the Dáil, fallen asleep. On 17 February 2013, the Chief Financial Officer of Anglo Irish Bank, Maarten van Eden, tendered his resignation writing that \\"I have no confidence whatsoever in the ability of government to do the right thing for the financial sector.\\" and describing the government's actions on the prommissory note as \\"pure window dressing\\". =Exit from bailout= Ireland officially exited the Troika bailout in December 2013. Taoiseach Enda Kenny gave an address to mark this official end, in which he said the country was moving in the right direction and claimed the economy was starting to recover. Commentators, including Gene Kerrigan and Vincent Browne, questioned its significance to the Irish economy, and many viewed it as a cosmetic public relations exercise. On 13 March 2013, Ireland managed to regain complete lending access on financial markets, when it successfully issued €5bn of 10-year maturity bonds at a yield of 4.3%. After having ended its bailout programme as scheduled in December 2013, there was no need for additional bailout support. Signs of recovery since 2014 After the bailout exit, the economy started to recover, recording growth of 4.8% in 2014. National debt fell to 109% of GDP and the budget deficit fell to 3.1% in the fourth quarter of 2014. However, opinion polls for the Fine Gael-Labour coalition in 2014 showed that approval ratings for government policies continued to drop and after numerous allegations of Gardaí malpractice resulted in the Minister for Justice Alan Shatter resigning and Taoiseach Enda Kenny awarding himself the office of Minister of Defence. As well as this the Government had formally established Irish Water, a company to charge people for water usage and had begun to install water metres in front of every property across the country, which caused huge controversy and protest throughout Ireland. During 2015, unemployment fell from 10.1% to 8.8%, while the economy grew by an estimated 6.7%. In November 2015, it was reported that exchequer receipts were €3 Billion ahead of target and that the government's tax revenues had risen by 10.5% throughout 2015. During 2015, Fine Gael rose in the opinion polls, while their coalition partner Labour struggled to rise above 10%. In 2016 there was significant attention on the accuracy and reliability of figures that indicated economic recovery. CSO figures—which seemed to indicate that Irish GDP rose by 26.3 per cent year-on-year 2015 to 2016—were acknowledged as being skewed by the profits of a small number of multinationals and some shell companies. The term \\"Leprechaun economics\\" was coined to describe this phenomenon.

Gameplay Lightning strikes The player controls the hero Telos on his winged horse Pegamis and has to explore two caves within a large scrolling playfield. While exploring the caves the player is threatened by flying creatures called \\"Nemesides\\" that appear occasionally. The player must also avoid obstacles such as striking lightning, exploding volcanoes, and falling rocks. If the player runs into any of these obstacles strength points are deducted. The player can replenish strength by collecting strength symbols. Dangling vines slow the player's movement, but not that of the Nemesides. The player can shoot and destroy Nemesides, but this is optional. The game doesn't award any score. To advance, Telos must collect and use different items in the caves. The ultimate goal is to collect three crown pieces which are scattered around the caves and bring the completed crown to King Arud near the game's starting point. In one-player-mode, it's only possible to shoot in the most recent direction moved, whereas in two-player mode one player moves the hero and the other player shoots. The game has three difficulty levels which differ in the amount of strength deducted when running into adversaries and in the frequency of the appearance of Nemesides. Reception Cavelord received a positive review in the March 1985 issue of German magazine Happy Computer.

It houses the Musée des beaux-arts and Muséum d'histoire naturelle de Marseille. The surrounding Longchamp Park (French: Parc Longchamp) is listed by the French Ministry of Culture as one of the Notable Gardens of France. History The Palais Longchamp was created to celebrate the construction of the Canal de Marseille, which was built to bring water from the Durance River to Marseille. Although the foundation stone was laid by the Duke of Orleans on 15 November 1839, the building took 30 years to complete, partly because of the enormous expense and partly because of difficulties with local regulations. Designed by the architect Henri-Jacques Espérandieu, the building was centered on the structure and elaborate fountain known as the château d'eau (\\"water castle\\").  Description  The Palais Longchamp at night The Palais Longchamp has three main parts: * The château d'eau * The east wing, which houses the Musée des Beaux-Arts * The west wing, which houses the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle  Park  Longchamp Park was opened in 1869, at the same time as the palace; in addition, the art and natural-history collections, which had been housed elsewhere, moved into the palace at this time. The park also contained a zoo, which was run by the city from 1898 until 1987, when, because of public disaffection with traditional zoos, it was closed. At the summit of the fountain are sculptures of four large bulls and three women—a central figure representing the Durance flanked by one who represents grapes and one who represents wheat and fertility. Behind the women, within the central structure of the palace, is a manmade stone grotto decorated with carved stalactites and nymphs. From beneath the three women and from the bulls, water flows into a secondary basin, and then into an artificial pond. The water drains out of the pond into underground pipes, from which it emerges in a waterfall-like structure, and in twelve ornate bronze fountains lined alongside it, flowing into a second, larger pond. The central feature of the garden behind the palace is a classic garden à la française, which is known as the Jardin du plateau. The garden also includes an English landscape garden, with winding alleys and many notable trees, including a 150-year-old plane tree and an oak and a Siberian elm that are both 120 years old. The area that was occupied by the 19th-century zoo still contains many of its picturesque buildings in fantastic styles, including oriental pavilions for the giraffe and elephant, cages ornamented with Turkish tiles, and bear cages and seal dens decorated with rocaille, or rock-work. In popular culture The music video of Soprano's single, \\"Ils Nous Connaissent Pas\\" was filmed at Palais Longchamp in 2014.

He became player-manager and continued in that role at Cesena. Having retired from playing, Magni went on to manage Pro Patria, Bari, Varese, Pavia and Salernitana. Career Magni began his career with Varese in 1937 and made 53 appearances in Serie C over the next three years, scoring nine goals. He joined Serie B club Liguria in 1940 – who would later become Sampdoria – and helped the club win promotion to Serie A in his first season, scoring 11 goals in 31 games. Having scored 12 times in 45 games for Liguria, Magni was transferred to Juventus in 1942. He scored ten league goals in his first season with Juventus, including four in one match – a 6–2 win against Triestina. He spent six years with the club, but only took part in four league campaigns due to the Second World War, which cancelled competitive football in Italy for two years. Magni scored 27 goals in 106 games for Juventus. Having left Juventus in 1948, he spent a year with Lucchese and then another with Genoa – amassing 73 more appearances in Serie A. Magni dropped down to Serie C in 1951 to join Lecce, where he began his managerial career. Having made ten appearances in his first season with the club, he was appointed as player-manager for the 1952–53 campaign. Lecce narrowly avoided relegation to Serie D – Magni played in four matches – and he left the club in 1953. He finished his playing career with Cesena, where he also served as player-manager, and appeared in Serie D for the first time, scoring once in 16 appearances. Magni left Cesena in 1954 and did not manage again for another four years. Magni returned to management in 1958 with Serie C side Pro Patria and the club won promotion to Serie B in the 1959–60 season under his stewardship. Having guided them to top-half finishes in Serie B over the next two years, Magni joined Bari in 1962. The club won promotion to Serie A during his first season in charge. Magni left the club in 1963 and spent the next two years away from management. He returned to Varese in 1965, who were now a Serie A club. The club finished bottom of the table during the 1965–66 season and were relegated. He joined Pavia in 1966 and managed them for a season before spending another two years away from the job. He finished his managerial career with a brief stint at Serie C side Salernitana in 1969.

Located within the heart of Mahsud land in Waziristan, Kaniguram is the principal place associated with the Ormur or Burki tribe. It was the hometown of the sixteenth-century Pashtun revolutionary leader and warrior-poet Bayazid Pir Roshan, who wrote the first known book of Pashto language. Today the locals in the town speak Ormuri as well as the Waziristani (Maseedwola) dialect of Pashto. Demographics The Burki primarily inhabit Kaniguram, the most populous settlement in South Waziristan, at around above sea level. This has been their tribe's focal point for over 800 years. Kaniguram has historically been off limits to outsiders except for the Burki and, more recently, the Mahsuds. Common store-front signs are \\"Burki knives\\" and \\"Burki pharmacy\\" and are indicative of the Burki's dominant position in Kaniguram despite being significantly outnumbered by Mahsuds. Relations between the Burki/Urmar and the Mahsuds are as complex as they are intimate. They are generally on good terms except for occasional skirmishes/war between the two. Despite living in an enclave within what has become Mahsud territory, the Urmar/Baraki/Burki have stubbornly retained their mother tongue/identity/traditions in Kaniguram. Kaniguram's layout is distinctive from other hamlets/settlements in the FATA in that the homes are adjacent or interconnected. Land in and around Kaniguram is exclusively in Burki, and to a lesser degree Mahsud, ownership or control. Bayazid Pir Roshan, a Burki/Urmar, fought a major insurgency against the Mughal Emperor Akbar in the early sixteenth century. They are considered as the armory of the Mahsuds due to their small-arms cottage industry, which, however, does not rival Darra Adam Khel's. Kaniguram's daggers once rivaled those of Damascus. Kaniguram is accessible from the north via the Razmak road and from the south from Wana on a narrow metalled road that is one of the few roads in South Waziristan. Access from this main \\"road\\" is limited to a suspension footbridge across a wide ravine that separates Kaniguram from the main road and is easy to guard, as behind it are mountains (Preghal and Jullundur) which limit access from the north. This footbridge has, more often than not, been unusable due to sabotage, damage etc. The people of this settlement often have to climb down the steep ravine from the road during harsh winter months and then climb back up to the Kaniguram side. Many of Kaniguram's Burki spend winters in second homes in Dera Ismail Khan, where some work at the airport, or as traders. They are very involved in Pakistan's trucking and construction industries based primarily out of Karachi and are enterprising businessmen and traders. Like other Pashtun tribes, the Burki seek self-segregation from the outside world: thus the importance of Kaniguram as the historical focal point of the tribe and the continued effort to retain their native tongue (Urmar), which predates Pushtu. Bayazid of the Urmars/Baraks became widely known as Pir Roshan or Rokhan, which in Pashto stands for \\"the Enlightened Sufi Master.\\" He was the first local leader to lead a major insurgency against the Mughal Emperor Akbar. Kaniguram's most famous resident was Bayazid Pir Roshan, whose descendants moved to Basti Baba Khel in the seventeenth century. Real name Bayazid, became known as Pir Roshan (the enlightened pir) and was an advocate for learning and equal treatment for women, a revolutionary concept for the times and even today in South Waziristan. From his base in Kaniguram, he started his insurgency movement, which was carried on by his children and then his grandchildren. The major focus of the movement was to create equality between men and women, including the right to learn and listen to lectures of scholars and to fight against Akbar after his proclamation of Din-i-Ilahi. Language and demographics Ormuri and Pashto (Masidwola) are spoken in Kaniguram; today, all Ormuri-speakers are also bilingual in the local Pashto dialect of Maseedwola. Most can also converse in Urdu and some in English. Burki are still found in Baraki Barak in Logar and outside Ghazni, Afghanistan; however, Pashto and Dari have replaced Ormuri language there. History The exact origin of Baraki/Burki/Ormur tribe has been widely contested by multiple historians. Captain (later Major) Robert Leech researched the Barki Barak (Logar) dialect of the Ormuri language. He said in 1838 that Henry Walter Bellew's book (1891) \\"An Enquiry into the Ethnography of Afghanistan\\", Bayazid's people — currently referred to as \\"Burki\\" but who until the early twentieth century were known as Barak or Baraki—were found in large numbers during the Greek period in their present environs (p. 62). On page 8 of this seminal work, Bellew refers to the Baraki's origins as \\"mysterious\\" but not of Arab/Ansari descent. On page 62, he writes of the Baraki: \\"After the time of the Greek dominion, the Baraki increased greatly in numbers and influence, and acquired extensive possessions towards the Hindu Kush in the north and the Suleman range in the south, and eastward as far as the Indus. During the reign of Mahmud Ghaznavi (2 November 971 – 30 April 1030), the Baraki were an important tribe, and largely aided the Sultan in his military expeditions. The reputation then acquired as soldiers they still retain, and the Afghan monarchs always entertain a bodyguard composed exclusively of Baraki. . . . In Afghanistan though their true origin is not suspected, the Baraki are a distinct people. The Baraki pretend descent from the Arab invaders, but this is a conceit of their conversion to Islam. They are a fine, tall and active people, with fairer complexions than the generality of Pashtuns, and are held in consideration as a respectable people. They have no place in the Pashtun genealogies by that name, being generally reckoned along with the Tajik population. Yet it is not altogether improbable that the present ruling tribe (Barakzai) of the Durrani/Abdali in Afghanistan and Pakistan is originally derived from the Baraki.\\"An Enquiry into the Ethnography of Afghanistan, pg 62, Bellew) George Grierson has given a detailed account of the language in the \\"Memoirs of the Asiatic Society of Bengal\\" 1918 [9], along with history of the tribe and the language. This work has been revised by including more information on the subject and published in his well-Known \\"Linguistic Survey of India Vol. X\\" in 1921. According to him: \\"Ormuri is a West Iranian language, and its nearest relatives are the dialects of western Persia and Kurdish. Another interesting point is that Ormuri, although a West Iranian language, contains manifest evidence of contact with the Dardic languages whose present habitat is the hill country south of the Hindu Kush. At the present day these languages are being gradually superseded by Pashto, and are dying out in the face of their more powerful neighbour. Those of the Swat and Indus Kohistans are disappearing before our eyes. There is reason to believe that this has been going on for several centuries. In historic times they were once spoken as far south as the Tirah valley, where now the only language heard is Pashto, and the fact that Ormuri shows traces of them leads to the supposition that there were once speakers of a Dardic languages still further south in Waziristan and, perhaps, the Logar country before they were occupied by the Pashtuns.\\" Notable people from Kaniguram Bayazid Pir Roshan 1525–1585 Pushtun warrior and intellectual, founder Roshaniyya (Enlightenment) movement.

Recent books and research  The invading armies in present Afghanistan and north west Pakistan seem to have paid significant attention to Kaniguram and the Barakis/Burkis. During the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan, Saint Petersburg State University Institute of Oriental Studies seemed to have been the institution tasked to study the Roshaniyya movement, in order to understand their foe (see reference section below). Following the 2002 invasion, some scholars into the field to study and understand this movement Sergei Andreyev, (Chief Joint Mission Analysis Center, United Nations), an Oxford academic was sent on UN assignment to Afghanistan, while at the same time he was funded by the Institute of Ismaili Studies to research and write a book on the movement.

His music has been broadcast on BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 3, BBC Radio 6 Music, and Resonance FM. Originally from Coalville, Leicestershire, he moved to London and trained at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama from 1997 to 2001. Work as Simon Bookish To date, Chadburn has released three solo albums under the name Simon Bookish. The first two, Unfair/Funfair (2006) and Trainwreck/Raincheck (2007), combined his voice with synthesizers and laptop computers. His use of spoken word on Trainwreck/Raincheck and in live performances drew comparisons with \\"Bowie and Baudrillard, Burroughs and Byrne\\". His third album, Everything/Everything (2008) featured an ensemble of brass instruments, saxophones, Farfisa organ, piano and harp. Chadburn describes this album as \\"a big band song cycle about science and information\\". Chadburn's most recent release as Simon Bookish was Red and Blue EP (2015), an experimental piece based on correspondence between Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. He has provided remixes of songs for bands and artists such as Grizzly Bear, Franz Ferdinand, The Organ, Owen Pallett, Seb Rochford and Late of the Pier. He has also contributed tracks to the compilation albums Worried Noodles (2007), a compilation of songs with lyrics by artist David Shrigley, and The Wall Re-built! (2010), which celebrated the 30th anniversary of Pink Floyd's The Wall, for Mojo Magazine. Work as Leo Chadburn Classical works Chadburn has written a number of works for classical music groups.

Chadburn is currently an associate composer of the London Symphony Orchestra, who performed his piece Brown Leather Sofa in 2013.  Albums (as Leo Chadburn)  Chadburn has released two albums under his own name, Epigram / Microgram (2013), an instrumental album which utilises the Casio CZ-101 synthesizer as its only sound source, and The Subject / The Object (2020), which comprises two 20-minute long tracks of spoken word stream of consciousness and drone music. Collaborations Chadburn has collaborated on a number of projects with visual artists. In 2009, he wrote the score for Richard Grayson's video installation The Golden Space City of God (exhibited at Matt's Gallery, London and Artpace, San Antonio), which featured a choir shot on location in Texas singing cult religious texts. In 2012 he collaborated with the artist Tanya Axford on a piece entitled The Path Made by a Boat in Sound (Three Down) for the Whitstable Biennale, and with video artist Jennet Thomas, on her work School of Change, a \\"sci-fi musical film\\", again exhibited at Matt's Gallery.

Background Formed around 1991, Scocha became established as a performing duo after the release of the album Bordering On in 2001. The band was founded by Iain Scott and David 'Chappy' Chapman (hence 'Sco' + 'Cha'), sharing guitars and vocals, who were later joined by Phil Clayton (bass guitar), then Alan Brydon (multiple instruments) and Dougie Anderson (drums). In 2012 Alan Brydon left, Dougie Anderson moved to guitar and Ross Walsh took over on drums. In 2014 Neil Jackson replaced Phil Clayton on bass. Since forming they have steadily grown in popularity and are now a well-known band in the Scottish Borders and beyond. They have released a number of albums as well as a live DVD that captures the atmosphere of one of their gigs, and two CD singles, The Borders and Turnbull Songs. Border poet Will H. Ogilvie (1869–1963) has provided words and inspiration for songs such as 'Raiders', 'Ho for the Blades of Harden' and 'The land we love'. In June 2019, a restructured band consisting of David Chapman, Dougie Anderson, Ross Walsh and Neil Jackson was established with the name of Harden Blades, following Scocha's disbandment in January 2019. The new name is a reference to Ogilvie's inspiration. Performances Scocha has performed before 15,000 people at the Glengarry Highland Games, the biggest highland games in North America in July 2008, where they returned to headline again in July 2010..

It is the most prominent landmark of Lutsk, Ukraine and as such appears on the 200 hryvnia bill. (Another city castle, called Lower Castle, built by the Czartoryski family since the 14th century, is now a ruin.) The Kievan town of Luchesk had a wooden wall as early as 1075, when Boleslaus the Bold laid siege to it for six months. Yury Dolgoruky failed to take Lutsk after a six-weeks siege in 1149. In 1255, the walls of Lutsk were stormed by Khan Jochi's grandson Kuremsa. The current castle, towering over the Styr River, was built mostly in the 1340s, although some parts of the earlier walls were used. It repelled sieges by numerous potentates, including Casimir the Great (1349), Jogaila (1431), and Sigismund Kęstutaitis (1436). It was there that the Lutsk Conference of 1429 took place, attended by Emperor Sigismund, Vasily II of Moscow, Jogaila, Vytautas the Great, and the voivode of Wallachia. During the long reign of Vytautas, Lutsk Castle was further fortified to guard against artillery and gunfire. The principal entrance, now bricked in, was from the west and adjoined a bridge over outer moat. Three main towers, now named \\"Lubart\\", \\"Švitrigaila\\" (both after Lithuanian princes) and the \\"Bishop\\", were built up in the course of the 16th and 17th centuries. The walls of the castle formerly enclosed St. John's Cathedral, a palace of the grand dukes, and an episcopal palace. Of these buildings, only the Neoclassical palace of the bishops still stands. On 2 July 1941 1,160 Jews were murdered within the walls of the castle.Timothy Snyder: The Life and Death of Western Volhynian Jewry, 1921-1945. In: Ray Brandon, Wendy Lower: The Shoah in Ukraine.

The band features two former members of Savatage, namely vocalist Zachary Stevens and drummer Jeff Plate. Zachary Stevens is also the vocalist for Circle II Circle and Jeff Plate is the drummer for the Trans-Siberian Orchestra, Metal Church and violinist Mark Wood. The band plays varied genres of hard rock including; heavy metal, acoustic rock and melodic metal. History For a period of eight years, from 1992 until 2000, Zachary Stevens and Jeff Plate were members of Savatage. After four albums and several world tours with the group, Zachary left citing family reasons. During the winter of 2002 Zak started his own band called Circle II Circle, co-writing with former Savatage lead singer Jon Oliva and guitarist Chris Caffery. The remaining members of Savatage eventually turned into the Trans-Siberian Orchestra, of which Jeff Plate is a founding member and is currently the east coast band's drummer. Zak and Jeff played in a band called Wicked Witch previously. With Mark Stewart on bass Boston native guitarist Matt Leff. Matt and Zak first met while attending Musicians Institute in Hollywood California. Upon graduating they moved to Boston Massachusetts and met Jeff. These three musicians have reunited under the band name \\"Machines Of Grace\\". When it was time to bring in a bassist, Chris Rapoza was called. Matt and Chris played together for several years in the Boston area metal band \\"Trigger Effect\\". Trigger Effect was chosen as one of the top unsigned bands in the United States by Sam Goody Record Stores, worked with Grammy winning producer Neil Kernon, and toured the Northeast as an opening act for Iron Maiden, Queensrÿche and Rob Halford. When 13 songs were ready to be recorded for the Machines Of Grace album, producer/engineer Paul David Hager was brought in. Paul previously mixed Wicked Witch live and in the studio. Paul has worked with many artists including The Goo Goo Dolls, Pink, Butch Walker, Megadeth, Miley Cyrus and Letters to Cleo. The album was recorded at Pyramid Sound in Ithaca, New York, Studio Metronome in Nashua New Hampshire, Red Room Recorders in Tampa, Florida and 37' Productions in Rockland Massachusetts. It was mixed at Skip Saylor Studios in Hollywood California and mastered at Sterling Sound in New York City. The band released their debut album, featuring 13 songs, worldwide in the summer of 2009 and plays live sporadically.

It is named after the Egmond Abbey, to which it was given by Dirk II, and where it remained for six centuries. It is most famous for being the earliest surviving manuscript showing scenes with Dutch people and buildings, and represents one of the oldest surviving Christian art treasures from the Netherlands. The manuscript has been owned by the Royal Library of the Netherlands since 1830. Codicological information The manuscript consists of 218 vellum folios measuring 232 by 207 mm. Its Latin text is written in a single column of Carolingian minuscule of 20 lines measuring 156 by 126 mm. Its original binding was made of oak boards covered in gold and set with gemstones, which is described in the \\"Rijmkroniek van Holland\\" (Rhyming Chronicle of Holland) that was written around 1300. In another description from 1805, Hendrik van Wijn describes a binding of wooden boards covered in brown leather, unmarked except for the date 1574. This is likely the year when the valuable binding was removed. The binding was replaced again in 1830 when it was acquired by the Royal Library of the Netherlands, and once more in 1949 with a calfskin parchment after it appeared that the previous hard-glued spine caused damage. Its current binding is made of white goat's skin and dates to a restoration in 1995. History St Adalbert to intercede for them with Christ The manuscript was written in the third quarter of the 9th century in northwestern France, likely in Reims.Beschrijving Meermanno It is not known who commissioned it. Around 900, eight folios were added to the manuscript, two at the beginning of each gospel. On the verso side of the first folio is the evangelist's symbol, and on the recto side on the second is his portrait. The second folio's verso side displays the incipit. The text on the following page was adjusted to reproduce the first letters of the text in large, decorative letters. It is still possible to see places where the original text was taken out, for example folio 19 recto, at the beginning of the Gospel of Matthew in the Liber Generationis. A space above the first line 'XPI FILII DAVID FILII ABRAHAM' is clearly visible, where the text has been removed and brought to the preceding pages. The page likely originally began: ‘INC EVANG SCDM MATTHEUM / LIBER GENERATIONIS / IHU XPI FILII DAVID FILII ABRAHAM'. The removed text was rewritten in decorative letters on the added folios 17v, 18r, and 19v. At this time the manuscript's current canon tables were also added. These seven folios precede the Gospel of Matthew and may have replaced the original canon tables, or have been the first ones themselves. The manuscript later came into the hands of the Frisian count Dirk II, who had its binding richly gilded and decorated with gemstones. He also added two miniatures paintings, in a diptych, in the back of the manuscript. These depict him and his consort, Hildegard of Flanders, giving the manuscript to the Egmond Abbey. The miniature paintings were likely added in Ghent between 975-988, while the gift itself took place in 975.Koninklijke Bibliotheek, 'Evangeliarium van Egmond', in: Patrick de Rynck (red.), Meesterlijke middeleeuwen: Miniaturen van Karel de Grote tot Karel de Stoute, 800-1475, Zwolle en Leuven 2002, p.123. The left miniature on folio 214 verso shows Dirk and Hildegard underneath an arched structure with the open gospel book lying on an altar. The exterior of the abbey (certainly a fictional representation) is depicted as an architectural frame for the event. The text in the upper lefthand corner indicates what is happening: :Hoc textum dedit almo patri Teodricus habendum :Necne sibi coniuncta simul Hildgardis amore :Altberto quorum memor ut sit iure per evum (This book was given by Dirk and his wife Hildegard to the merciful father Adalbert, so that he will think of them in eternity.) The recto side shows Dirk kneeling and Hildegard lying in proskynesis before Adalbert, the patron saint of the abbey, who pleads on their behalf to a Christ in Majesty. The accompany text reads: :Summe Deus rogito miserans conserva benigne, hos tibi quo iugitur formulari digne laborent The circular space around Christ likely suggests a Byzantian dome. The manuscript was kept at the Egmond Abbey until the Dutch Revolt. It was recorded in the abbey's inventory in 1571. In 1573, the abbey was looted and destroyed, but the Egmond Gospels had already been transported to safety in Haarlem by Godfried van Mierlo, the abbot of Egmond and bishop of Haarlem.Hendrik van Wijn, Huiszittend leven, Vol II, Amsterdam, 1817, p.340.J.H. Hofman, Iets Nieuws met wat Ouds, over Egmonds Graaflijk Evangelieboek in: Dietsche Warande. Nieuwe reeks. Deel 2. C.L. van Langenhuysen, Amsterdam 1879 The manuscript was handed over in 1578 to Pieter van Driel, the tax collector of Haarlem, along with a number of other valuable items. In 1583, Van Mierlo transferred its possession to Hendrik Bercheyk, from the Dominican monastery in Cologne. The Egmond Gospels remained in Cologne with the Dominicans until 1604. In that year Van Mierlo's successor, Sasbout Vosmeer took it into his possession after he was made apostolic vicariate of the diocese of Haarlem. The manuscript was likely kept at the seminary Vosmeer founded in Cologne. The manuscript returned to the Netherlands between 1656 and 1688, namely to Utrecht. In 1688, it was in the possession of the Geertekerk according to a note written by Joannes Lindeborne. Lindeborn was the pastor at St. Nicolaas and had been a student and rector at Vosmeer's seminary in Cologne. It is likely that Lindeborn brought the manuscript to Utrecht after the seminary was closed in 1683. In 1802, the Utrecht council member and archivist Petrus van Musschenbroek rediscovered the manuscript in the possession of Timot de Jongh, the pastor of the Old Roman church in Utrecht's Hoek. Van Musschenbroek's colleague, Hendrik van Wijn, had described the manuscript in his 1805 book \\"Huiszittend Leven\\" (\\"Domestic Life\\"). The manuscript had also been identified in 1720 by a previous pastor of the Old Roman church, Willibrord Kemp. In 1830, King William I purchased the Egmond Gospels for 800 guilders and donated it to the Royal Library.

The company went public in May 2012 on the NASDAQ exchange under the symbol ADNC.https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/audience-inc-ipo-- aec57dc4#section-details They specialized in improving voice clarity and noise suppression for a broad range of consumer products, including cellular phones, mobile devices and PCs. They were bought by Knowles for $130 Million in 3Q15 who changed their name to Knowles Intelligent Audio.https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1326532 Audience was the first company to have reverse-engineered the human hearing system and model its processes onto a chip, enabling computers and mobile devices to use the same kind of “auditory intelligence” that humans employ. By using this technology in conjunction with two or more microphones, background noise is suppressed, improving the quality of the remaining voice and reducing distraction for the listener.http://phandroid.com/2010/01/11/nexus-one-voice- quality-victory-via-audience-a1026-voice-processor/ This technology mimics the “cocktail party effect”. In 2010, Audience partnered with HTC to integrate their noise suppression technology into the Google Nexus One smartphone. The next year AT&T; introduced eight different handsets powered by Audience's earSmart technology including the Samsung Galaxy S III Skyrocket and the HTC Vivid. In 2013, Audience unveiled its eS515, a combination voice processor and audio codec. This single slot solution enables device manufacturers to streamline their designs, negating the need for a separate voice processor and codec.http://www.anandtech.com/show/6554/audience-announces-3rd-generation- sound-processor-es515 Background The company’s core technology reduces background noise and improves voice clarity on smartphones, computers and tablets. The company’s technology has shipped in more than 140 devices including the Nexus One, Samsung Galaxy S, Galaxy S 4, Galaxy Note, the iPhone4 and 4S, and the LG G2. Audience also works with other mobile phone manufacturers such as Huawei, Google, HTC, Sharp, Pantech, ZTE and others. In 2010, the company announced a collaboration with AT&T; to deliver its advanced voice capabilities to AT&T; devices and is engaged with multiple operators around the world. Most recently the company announced its first design implementation in the PC space with the Dell Vostro 5460. Products  They had two lines of processors, Advanced Voice and Smart Sound, both branded as \\"earSmart.\\" Advanced Voice processors come in a variety of models, the eS110 (supports 1 microphone), eS305 and eS310 (supports 2 microphones) and the company’s latest generation eS325 (supports 3 microphones), which was announced at Mobile World Congress 2013. Smart Sound processors combined the Advanced Voice processor feature set (HD call quality, wideband noise suppression, bandwidth expansion, acoustic echo cancelation, and improved performance for Automatic Speech Recognition) with a stereo audio codec. The company introduced its Smart Sound processor category at Consumer Electronics Show 2013 with the launch of the eS515. Technology The company’s technology was built around the foundation of Computational Auditory Scene Analysis (CASA) -- a field of study that builds on the concept of Auditory Scene Analysis (ASA), a term first coined by psychologist Albert Bregman. ASA enables humans to accurately group sounds—even when composed of multiple frequencies, as in music, or when heard simultaneously –- and avoid blending \\"sources.\\" As a result, ASA allows the listener to correctly distinguish and identify a sound of interest, like a voice, from other noise sources. CASA attempts to recreate sound source separation in the same manner as human hearing, but in machines. Using the principles of CASA, Audience’s earSmart processors act like a human cochlea and group different sounds, based on a diverse list of cues such as pitch, onset/offset time, spatial location and harmonicity. These simultaneous sounds are evaluated and grouped by source. In doing this, the microphones of a mobile device, together with Audience's proprietary \\"Fast Cochlea Transform\\" technology, can identify and group sounds which are classified as noise, remove or at least reduce them, and leave the remaining clear voice signal intact. Applications Beyond voice and video calls, this technology has been proven to improve the reliability and task completion rate of ASR (automatic speech recognition) in noisy environments as well as improve the quality and usability of media capture functions. Outside of the smartphone, tablet and mobile PC space, Audience is said to be targeting the Smart TV and Automotive markets where voice is becoming more commonplace as a form of user interface. Awards Audience was the Silver Winner in the 2008 Wall Street Journal Technology Innovation Awards and the Winner of the Semiconductor category.

Arrival in America and rise to power  Boris Nayfeld arrived in the United States in the late 1970s as a Soviet Jewish refugee under the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. He became a small- time criminal and was arrested in Nassau County for grand larceny, pleaded guilty to petty larceny and was placed on probation. He later became a bodyguard and chauffeur to Brighton Beach mob boss Evsei Agron. According to the NYPD, Nayfeld remains the prime suspect in the 1983 murder of Moldovan writer turned gangster Yuri Brokhin. After Agron's murder in 1985, Nayfeld became an enforcer for Ukrainian mob boss Marat Balagula who ruled the neighborhood rackets before being convicted of gasoline bootlegging in 1991. In the aftermath, Nayfeld took over the remnants of Balagula's organization and began to branch out on his own.  Heroin ring  Together with Italo–Polish gangster Ricardo Fanchini, Nayfeld ran a successful heroin- smuggling operation that transported China White from Thailand to the United States. After being smuggled into Singapore, the drug was hidden in television picture tubes and shipped to Poland via a Belgium-based import-export company. From there, couriers flew it via plane to Brighton Beach.Friedman, Robert I. Red Mafiya: How the Russian Mob Has Invaded America.

As of March 2012, the game has grossed ¥8.1 billion from arcade machine sales, equivalent to more than $100 million. *Fiscal year ended March 31, 2010: ¥3.3 billion () *Fiscal year ended March 31, 2011: ¥2.5 billion () *Six months ended March 31, 2012: ¥2.3 billion () * **¥3.3 billion = $40.7317 million **¥2.5 billion = $30.8542 million **¥2.3 billion = $28.6371 million Gameplay The game focuses on robot battles through network connectivity between arcade cabinets. Two teams of ten robots battle across different landscapes, which include cities, towns, and facilities. In each map, each team's goal is to destroy the opposing team's energy reactor core, marked in red and blue respectively. At the end of each match, Class Points will be given to the player to level up their current rank. The class point also affects the rank of the player. Generally, players who have just started the game will start playing in a series of cooperative battles against a computer-controlled \\"bots\\" team. The player will start facing actual opponents once when they have attained the rank of D4. Development Operating support of RingEdge arcade system has allegedly ended with the planned EOL being planned at the end of 2018. The arcade version of Border Break may end the service, but no official announcement has been made, and thus there is reason to believe that service and support has been extended for systems running Border Break, especially since the 2018 port of the game to the PlayStation 4 arrived rather late in comparison to it's arcade original.  PlayStation 4 port  In January 2018, Sega announced that it would port Border Break to PlayStation 4. A beta test was conducted a few times in February, and the final release was done in Japan in August. The port is free-to-play. Merchandise Kotobukiya released a series of model kits featuring the mecha from the game. The nine were the Cougar I, released in January 2010, the Heavy Guard II, released in March 2010, the Shrike I, released in May 2010, the Cougar I(A class color) with heavy armament, released in June 2010, the Shrike I with assault armament, released in July 2010, the Zebra 41, released in September 2010, the Cougar S (S class color), released in November 2010, the Saber II, released in January 2011, and the Shrike V, released in March 2011. A model kit of the mecha, Yaksha Rei released by Wave in July 2016.http://www.hobby- wave.com/LINE_UP/kit/borderbreak/01_yaksharei/ A CD soundtrack was released in November 2009 in Japan. The majority of music from Border Break is a fusion between electronica and rock. A CD single by Japanese pop artist Mechanical Panda, was released separately and contains the opening theme song, \\"Last Brave~Go To Zero\\". A second CD soundtrack titled, \\"Border Break Airburst\\", was released on 12/22/10. The music contained on this release is from the 2.0 upgraded version of the game. A third soundtrack titled \\"Border Break Airburst 2\\", was released on 10/03/12. This expanded soundtrack was a digital only release. A fourth and fifth soundtrack, titled \\"Border Break Union GRF\\" and \\"Border Break Union EUST\\" were released on 11/21/12. These expanded soundtracks were digital only. A fifth soundtrack, titled \\"Border Break Scramble\\" was released on 5/14/14 in Japan. The release was again digital only and contained music from the latest version of the game. Four walkthrough guides and an artbook have been released. The Border Break Art Book was translated in English by Udon Entertainment, and released in 2015. Two novels have been released, Border Break Nemesis Day (2012) and Border Break Historica (2014). A manga began in 2012.

It is located on the approximately thick Ekström Ice Shelf several kilometres south of Neumayer-Station II.DB mobil, Ausgabe 11, 2008 The station's assembly kit was transported to its current position early in November 2007. It is moving with the shelf ice at about 200 meters per year towards the open sea. After almost ten years of work on the project, beginning in October 1999, including conception, environmental impact assessment, planning and construction phases, regular operation of the station began on 20 February 2009. The station replaces the Neumayer-Station II and the Georg-von- Neumayer-Station that preceded it. The expected lifespan of the station is 25 to 30 years and the entire project is estimated to cost €39 million.  Construction phase  The station was constructed above ground on a temporary two-level platform, and it now rests on 16 hydraulic columns set on a solid snow surface. A garage and further technical equipment are located within a subsurface snow cavern at the front of the station. The moving concrete supporting feet are powered by hydraulic machinery. Through an annual lifting procedure of it is expected to prevent new snow from causing the platform to sink. The station runs all year round and includes of laboratory surface, divided into 12 compartments. It has twice the floor area of previous stations. Within the 15 living compartments there is room for 40 occupants to sleep. All inner rooms of the platform are built as self-contained units, some of which have aligned connecting passages, depending on their size. The compartmentalized interior of the station is enclosed in sheet metal with an interior polyurethane rigid foam insulation. The green metal girders in the “structure section” image indicate snow level; they are not part of the final structure. All items below the girders will later be embedded in the Antarctic snow. The above-surface construction method of Neumayer III is predominant in the Antarctic, seen at other new stations such as the American Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station and the Belgian Princess Elisabeth Base.  Assembly  A majority of the construction materials and the heavy steel frame were delivered by the end of January 2008. The plan specified that the last of the construction equipment had to leave Ekstrom Ice Shelf by March 2009. A crew of about 90 worked on construction. By mid-January 2009, the exterior work on the station was completed, so that further improvement to the 99 interior containers could continue unaffected by the weather.  Interior  In addition to the previously mentioned laboratories and accommodation areas, there is a south-facing lounge with many windows, a laundry room containing two washing machines and two dryers, a sauna, an information technology room, shower and washrooms, a dining room with a serving window connected to the kitchen, a conference room, medical treatment rooms, operating rooms, storage rooms, a refrigerated area, a dressing room, a room for the heating system, a planning and training room, and a water-treatment room.

Magnetic, seismic, trace element, and acoustic research are the chief research missions of these remote stations.  Research  Previous Neumayer stations have been the center of continuous research since 1981, especially with respect to their observatories. In addition to the main research areas of meteorology, geophysics and atmospheric chemistry, which have been studied on the stations since the 1980s, infrasound has been studied for five years and marine acoustics since 2005.  Climate  Neumayer Station experiences a dry-summer ice cap climate (Köppen EFs). In the winter, it is not shielded from the cold air masses of the interior, and as a consequence, on average the temperature drops to or below 10.3 times per year. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on July 8, 2010. It also experiences strong catabatic winds. On average, the wind speed reaches or surpasses 9 times per year. The highest wind speed ever recorded was on July 16, 2013. In that moment, the temperature was , decreasing the felt temperature to . There are 1430 sunshine hours per year. {{Weather box  location=Neumayer-Station III (2005-2015)  metric first = yes  single line = yes  Jan high C = -1  Feb high C = -5  Mar high C =-9  Apr high C = -14  May high C =-15  Jun high C = -18  Jul high C = -20  Aug high C = -19  Sep high C = -19  Oct high C = -13  Nov high C = -6  Dec high C = -2  Jan low C = -8  Feb low C = -13  Mar low C = -18  Apr low C = -24  May low C = -25  Jun low C = -29  Jul low C = -31  Aug low C = -29  Sep low C = -29  Oct low C = -22  Nov low C = -13  Dec low C = -9  Jan precipitation mm = 17  Feb precipitation mm = 18.7  Mar precipitation mm = 30.1  Apr precipitation mm = 34.1  May precipitation mm = 53.6  Jun precipitation mm = 35.2  Jul precipitation mm = 40.9  Aug precipitation mm = 32.2  Sep precipitation mm = 26.8  Oct precipitation mm = 47.9  Nov precipitation mm = 40.1  Dec precipitation mm = 18.9  source = Time and Date  Gallery  File:Stahlgerüstansicht Neumayer-Station III mit Beispieldämmelementen und Beispielkontainern.jpgAn image of a part of the station's steel structure as well as two ship containers in Bremerhaven during an open-house day Image:Hydraulikaufhängung mit Grundplatte aus Stahl Neumayer-Station III.jpgHydraulics attached to a concrete foot Image:Gerüstschnitt Neumayer-Station III mit simulierter Schneeoberkante.jpgStructure section See also *Neumayer-Station II * List of Antarctic research stations * List of Antarctic field camps * List of airports in Antarctica  References   External links  * The New Centre of German Research in Antarctica - Neumayer Station III * realnature.tv Video-, Foto-, und Textberichte über den Aufbau der Station in der Antarktis * A 2019 episode of Tomorrow Today, the English-language science programme of Deutsche Welle Television, which depicts the station and interviews residents * Video über die Station im Planet-Erde-Blog * Animierte Infografik zur deutschen Antarktisstation Neumayer III, Tagesschau, 20.

The Basel museums encompass a series of museums in the city of Basel, Switzerland, and the neighboring region. They represent a broad spectrum of collections with a marked concentration in the fine arts and house numerous holdings of international significance. With at least three dozen institutions, not including the local history collections in the surrounding communities, the region offers an extraordinarily high density of museums compared to other metropolitan areas of similar size. They draw some one and a half million visitors annually. Constituting an essential and defining component of Basel culture and cultural policy, the museums are the result of closely interwoven private and public collecting activities and promotion of arts and culture going back to the 16th century. The public museums of the canton of Basel-City arose from the 1661 purchase of the private Amerbach Cabinet by the city and the University of Basel and thus represent the oldest civic museum collection in continuous existence. Since the 1980s, a number of collections have been made public in new purpose-built structures that have achieved renown as acclaimed examples of avant-garde museum architecture.  Museum landscape  The main focus of collecting among Basel museums is the fine arts – painting, drawing and sculpture. More than a dozen museums cover a spectrum that extends from antiquity up to the present and includes historic and established works of art as well as pioneering creations. In particular, the latter category has been made increasingly accessible to the public over the past two decades in a series of newly opened museums. There are collections with more of a local and regional character, yet a number of area museums, especially the larger institutions, are noted for their international orientation and reach. In addition, Basel benefits from a long tradition of collecting that, in contrast to many other museums in Central Europe, was not disrupted by the wars of the 20th century, as well as from the city's well-established connections to the market of art dealers and art collectors – such as through Art Basel.

The museums continue to be oriented to the scholarly tasks of collecting, conserving and exhibiting as well as research and educationEspecially in the case of the major cantonal museums in Basel-City: \\"The museums have the task of collecting, preserving, documenting, researching and communicating cultural assets.\\" Museums Act (Museumsgesetz) from 16 June 1999, § 3. or at least view these as part of their activities. Consistent with museological trends seen elsewhere, however, the traditional self-image has evolved since the 1960s. Alongside the new forms of public outreach (museum education and didactics), institutional hybrid forms have arisen that actively embrace a sociopolitically relevant role and in which museum operations constitute just one facet, albeit a highly important one, of a more comprehensive cultural institution.

The Basel museum landscape can also be said to extend to the museums of the greater metropolitan area, such as those in the neighboring towns of Lörrach, Saint-Louis and Weil am Rhein, with the latter included in the annual Basel Museum Night through the participation of Vitra Design Museum in Weil. In view of the numerous municipal, regional and national administrative units that come together here as well as the broader agglomeration,See the overview of different territorial definitions and perimeters on the website of Eurodistrict Basel . it is difficult to produce a conclusive figure for the number of Basel museums. Yet even when taking a narrowly drawn perimeter, the total comes to at least three dozen institutions that house collections and make them accessible to the public. The Basel museums are also part of the German-French-Swiss \\"Upper Rhine Museum Pass\\" that was introduced in 1999. This covers a much wider area than the Basel region, however, extending via Strasbourg up to Mannheim.Map showing the area covered by the Upper Rhine Museum Pass.

A striking number of exhibition structures have incorporated a vocabulary of postmodern and deconstructivist forms. In and around Basel, new buildings, additions or renovations have been constructed from designs by nationally and internationally renowned architects (Renzo Piano, Zaha Hadid, Frank O. Gehry, Wilfried and Katharina Steib, Herzog & de Meuron, Mario Botta) and celebrated as examples of avant-garde museum architecture. In other area museums, by contrast, the building fabric is old to very old, consisting of former residential and commercial buildings or monasteries and churches that have been converted for exhibition purposes.

A number of Basel's museums are public institutions but the majority are privately sponsored, backed in most cases by foundations. Helping to generate the high density of museums compared to other cities and metropolitan areas of similar size,\\"Up until now, the label 'Museum City of Basel' was primarily associated with the valuable collections and numerous special exhibitions of the public and private museums that are present here in a unique density.\\" (Suter, Raphael (1995): \\"Ist das erste Museologie-Studium der Schweiz bereits am Ende?\\" Basler Jahrbuch 1994, p. 109.) \\"Cities with a comparable number of inhabitants typically possess an art gallery of regional significance at best. As a location for art museums, measured in terms of its size, Basel is unmatched.\\" (Becker, Maria (2 June 2008): \\"Die kleine Stadt der grossen Kunstschiffe\\". Neue Zürcher Zeitung.) these private collections have also made a substantial contribution to the high level of museum quality. The private collections nearly all came into being after the Second World War. Most of the public museums, by contrast, date from before the war. In fact, the collections of the five publicly run museums of the canton of Basel-City have histories that go back several centuries.  Development of the museums   Museums in the city  = Early collections = Caricature of the University of Basel professor Johann Jakob d’Annone (1728–1804), who bequeathed his cabinet of natural curiosities and antiquities to the public collection in the Haus zur Mücke. The origins of the first public collection are closely linked to the University of Basel and the early modern era collections of books, art and natural curiosities, of which there were quite a few in Basel. Prominent among them, the Amerbach printer family (founded by Johann Amerbach) had collected a substantial number of books, paintings, goldsmith works, coins and natural objects during the 16th century. In 1661, the Amerbach Cabinet was on the verge of being disbanded following a purchase offer from Amsterdam, then the European center for the trade in collector's items. At the urging of the mayor Johann Rudolf Wettstein, the city and university decided to jointly purchase the collection in order to keep it in Basel. Installed in the Haus zur Mücke just off Cathedral Square in 1671, the collection did not operate like a museum. It principally served as a library for university scholars, with only a few parlors on the first floor reserved for works of art and natural objects. Two librarians were in charge of administering the overall collection.Bonjour, Edgar (1960). Die Universität Basel 1460–1960. Helbing & Lichtenhahn, Basel, pp. 320–322. Cathedral Square with Haus zur Mücke (center of drawing, to the left of number 18) and the former monastery on Augustinergasse, the site of the first actual museum building from 1849 (at the bottom, by number 12) Beginning in the late 18th century, Basel saw an acceleration in the growth of collections of books and objects inspired by Enlightenment-era ideals of education and refinement. Significant holdings of antiquities, coins, fossils and natural curiosities made their way into the Haus zur Mücke through purchases, gifts or bequests by private collectors. An especially important addition came in 1823 with the contents of the Museum Faesch, a Basel collection from the 17th century. The first coherent ethnological collection was formed from the \\"Mexican cabinet\\" that had been assembled by the merchant Lukas Vischer from 1828 to 1837 during his travels in Central America. In 1821, the natural objects and artifacts were separated out from the collections in the Haus zur Mücke and an independent museum of natural history was established at the Falkensteiner Hof, likewise located right off Cathedral Square, which also included the instrument cabinets of the physics and chemistry institutes.Mathys, F. K. (1980). \\"Basels Schatzkammern. Zur Entstehung und Entwicklung unserer Museen.\\" Basler Stadtbuch 1979, pp. 151–164. The city's official repository for art was the Basel Town Hall (Rathaus) whose rich ornamentation and upkeep represented a constant undertaking for the city and a source of commissions for numerous artists from the early 16th century onward.Kreis, Georg; von Wartburg, Beat (2000). Basel. Geschichte einer städtischen Gesellschaft. Christoph Merian Publishing, Basel, pp. 395–396. The city armory likely had a \\"museum corner\\" starting in the 16th century. Following common practice, weapons that had become unfit for war were decommissioned for disposal. In Basel, however, a substantial number of them were preserved, which means that the armory caretakers wished to store the obsolete medieval or early modern militaria for the sake of memory value. The most prominent examples were the real and supposed trophies of the Burgundian booty from 1476, which had fallen to Basel and remained on display to curious onlookers centuries later.Historisches Museum Basel (1994): Historisches Museum Basel. Führer durch die Sammlungen. Merrell Holberton, London, p. 87. In contrast, the care and storage of the Basel Cathedral Treasury that had lost its liturgical value in the Reformation did not bear the character of a museum. Locked away in the cathedral sacristy for three centuries, the reliquaries and other religious objects remained inaccessible and out of view until 1833 and were merely listed as book value in the state budgets. = First museum building = The Museum on Augustinergasse in Basel, view toward Cathedral Square, 19th century In 1767, the university professor Johann Jakob d’Annone had the paintings and other objects moved to the previously empty ground floor of the Haus zur Mücke to create more space for the books on the first floor, and also provided for a more systematic organization. A few decades later, however, the building and its infrastructure no longer accommodated the increased volume of visitors (with the facility open four days of the week starting in 1829) and the modern culture of knowledge established through the Enlightenment. Moreover, a comprehensive index of the holdings was lacking, having been \\"altogether impossible heretofore in the inadequate premises where some pieces lay buried in darkened recesses for decades beneath an inch-thick layer of dust.\\"Publication commemorating the dedication of the museum in Basel on 26 November 1849. Basel 1849, p. 3. The need for space was resolved in 1849 with the removal of the collection to the multi-purpose building by Melchior Berri on Augustinergasse – simply named the \\"Museum\\" – on the site of the former Augustinian monastery. It was financed with a one-time contribution from the canton along with citizen donations. The late classicistic monumental edifice with decorative painting and frescoes by Arnold Böcklin is a comparatively early example of a civic museum and the first major museum in Basel. While taking clear inspiration from Karl Friedrich Schinkel and his Academy of Architecture in Berlin, the allocation of spaces and functions here combined university facilities with a library and natural history and art collections.Huber, Dorothea (1993). Architekturführer Basel. Die Baugeschichte der Stadt und ihrer Umgebung. Architekturmuseum Basel, Basel, pp. 112–114. This also served the institutional requirements of the university. Further examples of collections could be found in most of the subsidiary institutes – i.e., facilities with demonstration objects for instruction and research purposes. These included the instruments of the chemistry and physics institutes and the utensils of the anatomical institute. = Division of the public collections into state museums = Former Sculpture Hall of the Public Art Collection, today home to the “Stadtkino Basel” cinema Parallel to the specialization of the educational and research disciplines that took hold at the beginning of the 19th century, Basel's wide- ranging holdings of objects evolved into institutional collections divided according to various scientific fields. They were very different from the cabinets of curiosities that, according to the Basel professor Wilhelm Wackernagel, had merely involved \\"[mindless grabbing] at curiosities with a half-pedantic, half-childish zeal\\".Wackernagel, Wilhelm (1857): Über die mittelalterliche Sammlung zu Basel. Basel, p. 3. The Natural History Museum (Naturhistorisches Museum) founded in 1821 was the first step in this new direction. In 1836, the art collection was made legally independent from the university library with a separate publicly funded art commission to oversee it. In 1856, the \\"medieval collection\\" took up residence in auxiliary rooms and annexes of the Basel Cathedral (Bishop's Court, St. Nicholas Chapel), having been established earlier that year with inventories from the Museum on Augustinergasse based on the model of the German National Museum in Nuremberg. In 1887, castings of ancient sculptures were put on display in the Sculpture Hall of the Basel Art Association (Basler Kunstverein). Meanwhile, in 1874, the chemistry and physics institutes had moved into the new Bernoullianum building for the study of the natural sciences, whereupon their holdings of objects shed their collection character in favor of laboratory facilities.The Voluntary Museum Association of Basel (Freiwilliger Museumsverein) ended its support of the Bernoullianum in the 1870s, in contrast to the University Library, which remains a beneficiary of gifts and donations.Bonjour, Edgar (1960). Die Universität Basel 1460–1960. Helbing & Lichtenhahn, Basel, pp. 461–472. The canton had difficulty amassing funding and support for the creation of another museum for its collections. The Museum on Augustinergasse had represented a formidable beginning, yet remained the only one of its kind for nearly fifty years. University Library of Basel, 1896 In 1892, the \\"antiquarian collection\\" (small artifacts of antiquity, excluding ethnological objects) was joined with the medieval collection of the Basel Cathedral and historical weapons from the Basel Armory to form the Historical Museum Basel (Historisches Museum Basel), with exhibition space in the reconverted Barfüsser Church from 1894 onwards. Today this museum houses the Upper Rhine's most comprehensive collection of cultural history, showing artisanal crafts (Cathedral Treasury, goldsmith works, stained glass) and objects of everyday culture (furnishings, tapestries, coin cabinet). Major emphasis is placed on the Late Middle Ages, Renaissance and Baroque periods. The entire inventory of books was incorporated into the collection of the new University Library in 1896. The \\"ethnographic collection\\", which was given the title Collection of Ethnology (Sammlung für Völkerkunde) in 1905, moved into new space created by an addition to the Museum on Augustinergasse in 1917, where it became the Museum of Ethnology (Museum für Völkerkunde). With holdings of approximately 300,000 objects and a comparable number of historical photographs, it is the largest ethnological museum in Switzerland and one of the largest in Europe. The collection includes objects from Europe, Ancient Egypt, Africa, Asia (Tibet and Bali Collections), Ancient America and Oceania. In 1944, the federal administration distinguished its European holdings as the Swiss Museum of Ethnology (Schweizerisches Museum für Volkskunde). However, since 1997 this division no longer exists; non-European and European collections are now joined in the Basel Museum of Cultures (Museum der Kulturen Basel), whose name intentionally expresses a change in emphasis from the presentation of “foreign” cultures to intercultural dialogue.History of the Basel Museum of Cultures. The Natural History Museum Basel (Naturhistorisches Museum Basel), which features most areas of the natural sciences (anthropology, mineralogy, paleontology, vertebrates, insects including the Frey Collection of Beetles and other invertebrates), has not only remained in its original location since 1849 but has also retained its traditional name. Its collections, comprising nearly eight million objects which are also dedicated to scientific research, bear the title \\"Archives of Life\\". Basel Museum of Ancient Art and Ludwig Collection, rear annex with roof lighting The public art collection was installed in the upper story of the Museum on Augustinergasse in 1849. Its continuing growth led to increasing spatial demands that could not be met at that location. In 1936, after a planning period of roughly three decades, the art collection moved into the Kunstmuseum Basel. Satellite locations had already been established in 1922 at the Augustinerhof on Augustinergasse (collection of prints and drawings) and at the Bachofenhaus on Cathedral Square (Bachofen Collection with additional holdings). The greater part of the art collection was temporarily housed in the Kunsthalle from 1928 until 1936.History of the Kunstmuseum Basel. The Kunstmuseum's gallery of paintings and collection of prints and drawings comprise the largest and most significant public art collection in Switzerland. With an emphasis on paintings and drawings by artists of the Upper Rhine from 1400 to 1600 (Holbein family, Witz, Cranach the Elder, Grünewald) and art of the 19th to 21st centuries (Böcklin, van Gogh, Cézanne, Gauguin, Cubism with Picasso and Braque, German Expressionism, postwar American art), it also ranks as one of the leading international museums of its kind. Since the removal of the art collection to new quarters, the Museum on Augustinergasse has served as the exclusive domain of the Natural History Museum and the Museum of Cultures/Museum of Ethnology (Völkerkundemuseum/Museum der Kulturen). A major expansion of the public museum collections occurred in 1961 with the founding of the Basel Museum of Ancient Art and Ludwig Collection (Antikenmuseum Basel und Sammlung Ludwig). This new institution combined previous holdings from the Historical Museum (small artifacts of antiquity) and Kunstmuseum (sculptures) with acquisitions from private collections, which are displayed in two neoclassical villas located opposite the Kunstmuseum. The Museum of Ancient Art opened in the first villa in 1966 and expanded into the adjacent structure, also built by architect Melchior Berri, in 1988. It is the only Swiss museum devoted exclusively to the art of the Mediterranean area (mainly Egyptian, Etruscan, Greek, Italic and Roman cultures, as well as Levante and the Near East) from the 4th millennium B.C. to the 7th century A.D. The collections of Greek vases, Antique sculptures and Ancient Egyptian artifacts occupy a central position within its holdings.Departements of the Antikenmuseum Basel und Sammlung Ludwig. = Satellite locations of the state museums = Haus zum Kirschgarten, Museum of Domestic Life, satellite of the Historical Museum Basel The growing spatial needs of the collections that were housed in the Museum on Augustinergasse led to the incorporation of neighboring buildings. Similarly, the other museums also expanded. The Historical Museum in Barfüsser Church acquired the following satellite locations: the Museum of Domestic Life (Wohnmuseum) in the Segerhof (1926–34) and its successor in the Haus zum Kirschgarten since 1951, the Museum of Domestic Culture in Basel (Museum der Basler Wohnkultur); the Museum of Music (Musikmuseum), featuring five centuries of European musical history based on the musical instrument collection founded in 1943, which has been displayed since 2000 in the former prison Lohnhof; the carriage and sleigh collection in Brüglingen, established in 1981.Historisches Museum Basel (1994): Historisches Museum Basel. Führer durch die Sammlungen. Merrell Holberton, London, pp. 10–16. Replica casts of ancient sculptures that were originally on display in the Sculpture Hall (Skulpturenhalle), but moved into storage in 1927 due to a lack of public interest, became part of the Museum of Ancient Art (Antikenmuseum) in 1961 and again received their own exhibition space in 1963 in the new Basel Sculpture Hall (Skulpturhalle Basel). It features the world's only complete reconstruction of architectural sculpture from the Parthenon in Athens.History of the Basel Sculpture Hall. The Public Art Collection (Öffentliche Kunstsammlung) also expanded into a second building in 1981 with the Museum of Contemporary Art (Museum für Gegenwartskunst) in St. Alban-Tal. As the first public exhibition building project in Europe, it is devoted exclusively to the presentation of contemporary works and artistic production since 1960. In addition to classic media such as painting and sculpture, its acquisitions also include video art. = Defunct and semi-public museums = Kleines Klingental Museum, former City and Cathedral Museum The Museum of Applied Arts (Gewerbemuseum) was founded in 1878 by the Society of Trades and Craftsmen as a forum for the presentation of local arts and crafts. It became a semi-public institution in 1886 before coming under full public sponsorship in 1914. Renamed the Museum of Design (Museum für Gestaltung) in 1989 due to its broadening thematic spectrum, it was closed in 1996. Affected by the same cuts in public funding was the architecturally oriented City and Cathedral Museum (Stadt- und Münstermuseum), established in 1939 under the auspices of the public agency for the preservation of historic monuments in the former convent of Kleines Klingental. The holdings of the Museum of Design were distributed among other institutions, with the transferral of its library and poster collection to the School of Design (Schule für Gestaltung).History of the Museum of Design (Museum für Gestaltung) The museum was initially continued on a private basis in Weil am Rhein and then in Basel as an exhibition firm. The School of Design (Schule für Gestaltung) still mounts exhibitions with holdings from the poster collection. Thanks to the support of a foundation, the City and Cathedral Museum remains on the same premises under the present name Kleines Klingental Museum. The Swiss Firefighting Museum (Schweizerisches Feuerwehrmuseum), founded in 1957 as the Basel Firefighting Museum, is housed on the premises of the cantonal Fire Brigade but does not have the status of a public museum and is not administered by the canton. Its collection, which includes permanent loans from the Historical Museum, features documents that date back to the 13th century.Mathys, F. K. (1980). \\"Basels Schatzkammern. Zur Entstehung und Entwicklung unserer Museen.\\" Basler Stadtbuch 1979, p. 162. The Hörnli Cemetery Collection (Sammlung Friedhof Hörnli) operates under similar conditions: It has been located on the property of the canton's Central Cemetery since 1994 but is funded and run by a private association. On display are burial objects such as urns, documents on the history of cremation, hearses, coffins, cemetery regulations, graveyard crosses, glass pearl chains and memorial keepsakes. = Additional museums = Kunsthalle Basel, rear façade with interior courtyard The first museum that was not supported and administered by the canton of Basel-City was established in 1860 in a large room at the Basel Mission. It presented ritual and cultural objects from the countries and ethnic groups among which the Basel Mission was active, as well as a portrait gallery of its missionaries. However, parts of this exhibit were later sold to the canton and the gallery space was closed.Mathys, F. K. (1980). \\"Basels Schatzkammern. Zur Entstehung und Entwicklung unserer Museen.\\" Basler Stadtbuch 1979, p. 159. The concept of a multi-purpose building, following the example of the Museum on Augustinergasse, was embraced by the Basel Art Society (Basler Kunstverein), which erected the Kunsthalle on Steinenberg between 1869 and 1872. In addition to exhibition space and administrative offices, this building housed a library and studio space for sculptors. A building wing added in 1885 accommodated the Sculpture Hall (Skulpturhalle), where the previously mentioned casts of Antique statues from the Museum on Augustinergasse were displayed from 1886 to 1927. The former Artists House (Künstlerhaus) now defines itself “as a hub between artists and art agents and as a place that brings together local and international developments.”History of the Kunsthalle The next privately initiated museum was the above-mentioned Museum of Applied Arts (Gewerbemuseum); founded in 1878, it came under cantonal administration just eight years later.Mathys, F. K. (1980). \\"Basels Schatzkammern. Zur Entstehung und Entwicklung unserer Museen.\\" Basler Stadtbuch 1979, pp. 159–160. The Anatomical Museum (Anatomisches Museum) of the University of Basel dates back to the acquisitional activities of Carl Gustav Jung in the 1820s. As the Collection of Pathology and Anatomy (Pathologisch-Anatomische Sammlung), it moved into its own building in 1880. Two especially significant objects in this collection are the oldest anatomical specimen in the world (prepared by Andreas Vesalius in Basel in 1543) and a skeleton prepared by Felix Platter in 1573.Bonjour, Edgar (1960). Die Universität Basel 1460–1960. Helbing & Lichtenhahn, Basel, pp. 465–466. The Museum of Pharmacy (Pharmazie- Historisches Museum, originally the Historical Apothecary Collection) followed in 1924 after the donation of a private collection to the University of Basel. It is one of the world's largest collections on the history of pharmacy, encompassing old pharmaceuticals and early apothecary objects, laboratory utensils, ceramics, instruments, books, arts and crafts. The Swiss Gymnastics and Sports Museum (Schweizerische Turn- und Sportmuseum), established in 1945, was renamed as the Swiss Sport Museum in 1977. Sponsored by a foundation (Stiftung Sportmuseum Schweiz), its major focus is on ball sports, cycling, gymnastics and winter sports. The shipping museum Transport Hub Switzerland (Verkehrsdrehscheibe Schweiz) emerged from a 1954 exhibition by the Swiss Shipping Company (Schweizerische Reederei) in the Rhine ports of Basel, entitled “Our Path to the Sea.” It is also supported and run by an association of private citizens. The Swiss Historical Paper Collection (Schweizerische Papierhistorische Sammlung) was an affiliate of the Museum of Ethnology (Museum für Völkerkunde) from 1954 to 1979 before moving into independent quarters in the Gallician Mill, located in the former industrial district of St. Alban, in 1980. Now known as the Swiss Museum for Paper, Writing and Printing (Schweizerisches Museum für Papier, Schrift und Druck), it is sponsored by the Basel Paper Mill Foundation (Stiftung Basler Papiermühle). The Jewish Museum of Switzerland (Jüdisches Museum Schweiz), which presents the cultural history of Jews in Switzerland and in Basel including documents from the First Zionist Congress held in Basel in 1897, was founded by the Society for the Jewish Museum of Switzerland in 1966.Mathys, F. K. (1980). \\"Basels Schatzkammern. Zur Entstehung und Entwicklung unserer Museen.\\" Basler Stadtbuch 1979, pp. 160–163. Klingental Exhibition Gallery on the premises of the Kaserne Basel cultural center Like the Kleines Klingental Museum, the Klingental Exhibition Gallery (Ausstellungsraum Klingental) is located in the building complex of the former Klingental convent. Opened in 1974, the gallery serves as a presentation platform for the current work of artists living in Basel and aims to support emerging artistic talents. It is sponsored by the Klingental Gallery Society (Verein Ausstellungsraum Klingental). The Caricature and Cartoon Museum Basel (Karikatur & Cartoon Museum Basel), by contrast, was initiated by an individual, the collector and patron Dieter Burckhardt. Founded in 1979, it is devoted to caricatures, cartoons, comics, parodies and pastiches. The eponymous foundation (Stiftung Karikatur & Cartoon Museum Basel) is a dependent affiliate of the Christoph Merian Foundation. The exhibition galleries have been located in a structure from the Late Gothic period since 1996, following the completion of renovations and a new building addition by the architects Herzog & de Meuron. The Swiss Architecture Museum (Schweizerisches Architekturmuseum), founded in 1984, has resided since 2004 in the building complex of the Kunsthalle, which was completely renovated and redesigned by the architectural offices Miller & Maranta and Peter Märkli.Swiss Architecture Museum (Schweizerisches Architekturmuseum) The Architecture Museum opens its new premises in the Kunsthalle. The museum, sponsored by the Architecture Museum Foundation, presents alternating exhibitions on topics of international architecture and urbanism. An advantageous factor is the unusual concentration of internationally renowned architectural firms in Basel; Herzog & de Meuron, in particular, have made significant contributions to regional museum architecture. Opened in 1996, the Tinguely Museum features a permanent exhibition on the life and work of the artist Jean Tinguely. The museum's temporary exhibitions present works by friends and contemporaries of Tinguely, as well as other modern artists. Designed by Mario Botta, the museum is financed entirely by the Basel pharmaceutical company Hoffmann-La Roche. The Dollhouse Museum (Puppenhausmuseum) was founded in 1998 by its patron and owner Gigi Oeri, who built up the collection herself. In addition to dolls, dollhouses and miniature shops from the 19th and 20th century, it displays the world's largest collection of teddy bears. The media art space [plug.in] opened its doors in 2000 with the backing of the Forum for New Media Association (Verein Forum für neue Medien), which had been founded the previous year. It realizes exhibitions and projects, provides artists with international networking opportunities and helps convey works of media art to the general public. With one of the world's most extensive collections of photographs (around 300,000 works with an emphasis on industrial society in the 19th century), the Herzog Foundation has exhibited its holdings since 2002 in a “Laboratory for Photography”. Located in the Dreispitz industrial sector, the warehouse converted by Herzog & de Meuron encompasses the collection along with a reference library on the history of photography and two additional rooms for study, teaching and research purposes.Website of the Herzog Foundation.  Museums in surrounding communities  Many of the small and mid-sized municipalities around Basel have museums of local history and cultureSee the corresponding entries on the Basel-Country website: \\"Museums in the Municipalities\\" (in German) that are not presented in the following. Mention is given to institutions whose scope extends beyond the local level and which are generally open to the public several days a week. = Collections of natural, cultural and technological history = The oldest museum in the Basel region outside the city is the Museum of Canton Basel-Country (Museum des Kantons Basel-Landschaft) in Liestal, nowadays called Museum.BL. It was founded in 1837 as a \\"Cabinet of Natural Curiosities\\" (Naturaliencabinett) and up through the 1930s primarily took up objects of natural history into the collections. Since then, the emphasis has shifted toward cultural history. The diversity of the collection allows the museum to address wide-ranging themes related to the environment, history and the present day. The Museum am Burghof in Lörrach traces its origins to the Lörrach Antiquities Association (Lörracher Altertumsverein) founded in 1882, which bequeathed its collection to the town of Lörrach in 1927. Commencing operations in 1932 as the Museum of Local History (Heimatmuseum), the current permanent exhibition “ExpoTriRhena” presents the history, present-day culture and divisions and similarities within the \\"Dreiländereck\\" (Three-Countries Corner) border region where Germany, France and Switzerland meet.History of the Museum am Burghof. The amphitheater of the open-air museum Augusta Raurica Opened in 1957, the Roman Museum at Augst (Römermuseum Augst) is an open-air museum on the grounds of the former Roman city of Augusta Raurica, which has been the subject of excavations going back to the Renaissance. The exhibits feature numerous archaeological finds, including the largest silver treasure from Late Antiquity. The adjacent reconstruction of a Roman House (Römerhaus) was a gift of the Basel patron René Clavel while the museum and the entire archaeological park constitute a departmental division of Basel-Country. Located in the Brüglinger Plateau, the Mill Museum (Mühlemuseum) of the Christoph Merian Foundation is housed in the water mill of the former Brüglingen farming estate. The structure was converted into a museum in 1966 and presents the history of the mill and the work of millers from the Bronze Age up to the 20th century. The mill is still functional, allowing periodic demonstrations of the operational sequence from the water-powered mill wheel to the rotating millstone. Opened to the public in 1972, the Toy Museum and Village and Wine Cultivation Museum (Spielzeugmuseum, Dorf- und Rebbaumuseum) in Riehen complements its exhibits of village history and wine growing with one of the most significant collections of European toys. The toys are drawn from private collections as well as loans from the Museum of Cultures (Museum der Kulturen). The museum is operated as a division of the municipal administration of Riehen.Monteil, Annemarie (1977). Basler Museen. Birkhäuser Publishing, Basel, p. 300. The Museum of Music Automatons (Museum für Musikautomaten) in Seewen, located on the outermost periphery of the Basel museum territory, houses one of the world's largest and most well known collections of Swiss music boxes, disc music boxes, musical timepieces and jewelry and other mechanical musical automatons. It opened to the public in 1979 as a private museum of the collector Heinrich Weiss and was gifted to the Swiss Confederation in 1990. A newly remodeled and expanded facility for presentation of the exhibits was completed in 2000.History of the Museum of Music Automatons. Finally, the Museum of Electricity (Elektrizitätsmuseum) of the electric utility Elektra Birseck opened its doors in Münchenstein in 1997. Exhibits explore the history and development of power production and its use. The collection contains rare historic equipment and is complemented by a laboratory in which visitors can experiment with electric power. = Emphasis on art collections = Vitra Design Museum, front view (architect: Frank O. Gehry) Since the late 1980s, the Basel region has seen a proliferation of new museums addressing themes of art and design, especially concerning works from more recent years. The Vitra Design Museum in Weil am Rhein presents a broad range of design topics, with a special emphasis on furniture and interior design. Though originally based on the private collection of chairs and other furniture assembled by Rolf Fehlbaum, the owner of the Vitra furniture company, the museum was established as an independent institution. The Vitra building complex has made notable contributions to the body of avant-garde architecture in the Basel region. In addition to the 1989 museum by Frank O. Gehry, the grounds feature structures by Zaha Hadid, Nicholas Grimshaw, Tadao Ando and Álvaro Siza. In 1982, the Beyeler Foundation assumed ownership of the art collection of Hildy and Ernst Beyeler, which the couple had built up over half a century. Since 1997, the works of classical modern art have been exhibited in a building designed by Renzo Piano in the town of Riehen. Featured artists include Degas, Monet, Cézanne, van Gogh, Picasso, Rothko, Warhol, Lichtenstein and Bacon. The trees in the park surrounding the highly acclaimed building were wrapped by Christo and Jeanne-Claude in 1998. Sculpture by Nigel Hall in Schönthal With the creation of the Basel-Country Art Museum (Kunsthaus Baselland) in Muttenz, the Basel-Country Art Association (Kunstverein Baselland) was given its own dedicated exhibition building in 1997. The Art Museum is devoted to contemporary art and presents temporary exhibitions of current projects by regional and international artists.Informations about the Museum and the Art Association. Opened in 1998, Riehen Art Space (Kunst Raum Riehen) is another public institution with a similar thematic orientation. It serves the municipality of Riehen and its art commission with exhibitions of contemporary works of art from the region.Informations about the Riehen Art Space. Established in 2001, the Sculpture at Schoenthal Foundation in the former Schönthal monastery presents over twenty works by international and Swiss artists in a permanently accessible sculpture park under the motto “Art and Nature in Dialogue”. A Romanesque-era church has been converted into a gallery for temporary exhibitions of contemporary artists.Website of the Sculpture at Schoenthal Foundation In 2003, the Schaulager (or “viewing warehouse”) of the Emanuel Hoffmann Foundation was opened in Münchenstein. Centered on the avant-garde art collection of the foundation, the institute functions as a mix between public museum, art storage facility and art research institute. The polygonal building is a design by the architects Herzog & de Meuron. The Fernet Branca Contemporary Art Space (Espace d’Art Contemporain Fernet Branca) in Saint- Louis, the Alsatian town just across the border from Basel, is located in the former Fernet-Branca spirits distillery that was decommissioned in 2000. Since 2004, the museum has presented temporary exhibitions on contemporary art themes and artists. The museum's operations are supported by the Association for the Fernet Branca Contemporary Art Museum (Association pour le Musée d’Art Contemporain Fernet Branca).Museum history (French)  Museum promotion and museum policy   Primacy of the library  Visitors to the art collection in the Haus zur Mücke, 1837. The guided tours were given by the caretaker. Many museums can be traced back to courtly collections – at least in terms of the original set of holdings. Since the 19th century, in contrast, Basel has embraced a culture of remembrance of having created the oldest existing civic museum collection through its purchase of the Amerbach Cabinet in the year 1661.There are older though no longer existent municipal collections. For instance, the Zurich Citizens’ Library (Zürcher Burgerbibliothek) was founded back in 1629 with an affiliated coin cabinet and art collection but closed its doors in 1780. The acquisition of a collection from the 16th century fits with the historical and documentary interest in art that was prevalent at the time. In fact, however, the purchase was chiefly prompted by a desire to enhance the university's inventory of books with the extensive book holdings of the Amerbach Cabinet.Meier, Nikolaus (1999). Identität und Differenz. Zum 150. Jahrestag der Eröffnung des Museums an der Augustinergasse in Basel. Offprint from volume 100 of the Basler Zeitschrift für Geschichte und Altertumskunde, p. 133. The Haus zur Mücke community hall that housed the university- administered collection was called the “Library” in recognition of its primary function. The role as the city's art repository did not shift from the Basel Town Hall (Rathaus) to the Haus zur Mücke until the latter half of the 18th century. The Passion Altarpiece by Holbein that had been one of the main visitor attractions since the Reformation was moved over in 1770, followed by several additional paintings from the town council's inventories in 1771 and Holbein's organ doors from the Cathedral in 1786.Kreis, Georg; von Wartburg, Beat (2000). Basel. Geschichte einer städtischen Gesellschaft. Christoph Merian Publishing, Basel, p. 397. Despite this weighting of the collections, the official legal status remained unchanged for quite some time. The natural history holdings and art collection were not split off from the library until 1821 and 1836, respectively. At the end of the 18th century, civic museum culture was still in the early stages of its development, as illustrated by the very limited opening hours of the Haus zur Mücke (Thursday afternoon from two to four in the afternoon, otherwise on requestMeier, Nikolaus (1999). Identität und Differenz. Zum 150. Jahrestag der Eröffnung des Museums an der Augustinergasse in Basel. Offprint from volume 100 of the Basler Zeitschrift für Geschichte und Altertumskunde, p. 136.). The first records of regular gallery visits by city residents and outside visitors date to this period. In the three centuries before and after 1800, most of the collection activities involved objects of natural history, with a substantial number of acquisitions and gifts in this area. The numerous top-level art objects that made their way to Basel in the 1790s from Revolutionary France, on the other hand, did not find a wide audience of buyers and in most cases were resold.Kreis, Georg; von Wartburg, Beat (2000). Basel. Geschichte einer städtischen Gesellschaft. Christoph Merian Publishing, Basel, p. 398.  Transfer to the state and popular education  For the republican and monarchical civic states of the 19th century, collections in the form of public museums became emblems of self-determination. The carting off of large numbers of artworks to Paris during the Napoleonic Wars had created an awareness of the identity-shaping power of art. Institutional role models were the “Musée français” in the Louvre and the “Musée des monuments français” in a former Augustinian convent, which closed in 1816. The maintenance of programmatic museum collections and the construction of museum buildings became one of the most prominent and defining national functions.Meier, Nikolaus (1999). Identität und Differenz. Zum 150. Jahrestag der Eröffnung des Museums an der Augustinergasse in Basel. Offprint from volume 100 of the Basler Zeitschrift für Geschichte und Altertumskunde, pp. 121–122. In the case of Basel, however, it was the increasing need for space in the Haus zur Mücke that prompted deliberations regarding construction of a new building. The discussion concerning the right location for the public collection took on a political dimension following the division of the canton into city and regional sections. The University Act (Universitätsgesetz) of 1818 had made the corporatively autonomous university a cantonal educational establishment, with the university holdings thus owned indirectly by the state. According to the arbitral decision governing the cantonal split, two-thirds of the university's collection belonged to the regional canton and had to be purchased by the city canton. The ensuing consternation in the city led to the Administration and Use of University Holdings Act (Gesetz über Verwaltung und Verwendung des Universitätsgutes) of 1836 that such goods were indissolubly tied to the locality of the city of Basel for the purposes of education. This provision has remained in effect to the present day.The university holdings constitute “the indivisible property of the canton of Basel-City, indissolubly tied to the locality of the city of Basel and never to be alienated from the stipulations of the foundations and the function of the institutions of higher education.” University Holdings Act (Gesetz über das Universitätsgut) from 16 June 1999, § 2.Meier, Nikolaus (1999).

Offprint from volume 100 of the Basler Zeitschrift für Geschichte und Altertumskunde, pp. 124–125. The middle section of the frieze on the Museum on Augustinergasse. The city goddess Basilea and the river god Rhenus are not adjoined by figures from the academic arts or sciences, but by emblems of modern civic life: Libertas as an allegory of political freedom and Mercury as the god of commerce and trade. A functioning smokestack can be seen in the background to the right of Basilea. These occurrences led to the founding of the Voluntary Academic Society of Basel (Freiwillige Akademische Gesellschaft) in 1835, which began supporting the collections in financial terms and through purchases and gifts as part of its general promotion of the university. Yet the greatest momentum for the museum building came from natural science circles centered on the physics and chemistry professor Peter Merian, who was likely responsible for securing a dedicated annual budget for the Natural History Museum – the only state collection with this distinction. A combination of academic institution, library and laboratories, the establishment of the Natural History Museum at the Falkensteiner Hof also provided a model for the museum building. The fact that a primary museum building was ultimately created instead of a university- affiliated building was due to the university's poor standing among wide sections of the merchant and industrialist classes. In these sectors, the university was considered a backward-looking institution. The museum, by contrast, was seen as a driving force for practical popular education and the community was willing to support its construction with private contributions as part of a wider process of renewal in the city.Meier, Nikolaus (1999).

Museum on Augustinergasse, gallery of the Old Masters, 1907 At the instigation of Christian Friedrich Schönbein, the Voluntary Museum Association of Basel (Freiwilliger Museumsverein) was initiated in 1850 as the successor to an earlier association founded in 1841 for the construction of the museum. Modelled after the Royal Institution in London, it was established to “stimulate the appreciation of science and art”.Bonjour, Edgar (1960). Die Universität Basel von den Anfängen bis zur Gegenwart. 1460–1960. Helbing & Lichtenhahn, Basel, p. 409. Open to all residents of Basel, the association promoted the collections with financial means and sought to generate interest in the museum through public lectures to which women were also admitted. It was unable to sustain the initial enthusiasm, however, and experienced losses in membership despite Basel's rapid population growth in the latter half of the century. The museum did not embrace the function of popular education that had been promoted by its founders and supporters. The ideational socialization role of the museum was very slow to proceed, with the museum long holding onto former organizational structures. The art collection furthermore did not get an academically trained conservator until 1887. In addition, the renewed University Act of 1866 discontinued regular state appropriations for the antiquarian, medieval and art collections and left them dependent on proceeds from entry fees and the support of associations and private individuals, the most significant of these being the Birrmann Foundation and the Emilie Linder Foundation on behalf of the art collection. It was this support that enabled an active collection policy that went beyond the receipt of inherited cultural assets.Bonjour, Edgar (1960).

Civic culture of remembrance and modernism  Poster for the opening of the Historical Museum Basel in 1894. The advertising targeted a sophisticated bourgeois public. From the outset, the museum authorities charged the collections with a federal mission, wanting them to exert a “beneficial and salutary influence on the entire Fatherland”.Meier, Nikolaus (1999).

Offprint from volume 100 of the Basler Zeitschrift für Geschichte und Altertumskunde, p. 179. grew over time, primarily through acquisitions of Swiss works of art. When negotiations got underway in 1883 regarding the establishment of a federal museum, the canton of Basel-City sought to be chosen as the location for the new institution and proposed its collections of cultural history as the nucleus of the museum, systematically expanding them in light of its candidacy. While the Swiss National Museum (Schweizerisches Landesmuseum) ended up in Zurich, plans were nevertheless realized for a history museum that was no longer generally Swiss but specifically related to Basel, located in the historic former Barfüsser Church from the High Gothic period. The establishment of the Historical Museum “was a self-assured display of Basel’s art-mindedness and craftsmanship, a mix of educational corridor and enfilade of stalls”.Huber, Dorothea (1993). Architekturführer Basel. Die Baugeschichte der Stadt und ihrer Umgebung. Architecture Museum Basel, Basel, p. 193. The transfer of the Museum of Applied Arts (Gewerbemuseum) to the state a few years earlier as an arena of contemporary achievements can likewise be seen under the aspect of civic pride and reinvented sense of commonality in which the citizenry understood its ideals and capabilities as a foundation of state and society. Postcard with interior view of the Barfüsser Church, 1894. The permanent exhibition of the Historical Museum is designed as an overflowing medieval guild and weaponry exhibition. While the collections had clearly established their international standing, this appreciation did not become rooted in the cultural awareness of a broader range of social classes until the end of the 19th century. The historic culture of remembrance that was growing in importance and impact at the time was strongly linked with the medieval collection and the many Late Medieval and Renaissance works of the Upper Rhine in the Kunstmuseum. In the years since, Basel has also cultivated its claim of possessing the oldest municipal art collection in continuous existence through its acquisition of the Amerbach Cabinet.Meier, Nikolaus (1999). Identität und Differenz. Zum 150. Jahrestag der Eröffnung des Museums an der Augustinergasse in Basel. Offprint from volume 100 of the Basler Zeitschrift für Geschichte und Altertumskunde, pp. 122, 133. On the occasion of two major public celebrations in 1892 (500th anniversary of Greater Basel's acquisition of Lesser Basel) and 1901 (Basel's 400th anniversary as part of the Swiss Confederation), Basel presented the civically minded portion of the population (and hence the base of support for the museums) with a series of identity-shaping historical and patriotic gestures that borrowed from the store of images from the past available in the museums. File:Franz Marc-The Franz Marc: Animal Destinies, 1913. The painting was offered by the German Reich in 1939 as “degenerate art” and purchased by the city of Basel. With the epochal break of the First World War and in light of societal and cultural developments, the Basel museums became concerned with the citizenry's assertions of legitimacy and quest for recognition and their representation within these very same institutions. The discussions regarding the relationship of the museums to modernism took on particular relevance in the area of the fine arts. The construction of a dedicated museum for Basel's art collection ignited a “monumentality debate” in the late 1920s, in which the proponents of functionally oriented New Building (Neues Bauen) rejected the timelessly classic palatial form that was ultimately chosen as a demonstration of power by a conservative and “intellectually spent” notion of culture.Huber, Dorothea (1993). Architekturführer Basel. Die Baugeschichte der Stadt und ihrer Umgebung. Architecture Museum Basel, Basel, pp. 301–302. In contrast to the form of architectural expression and the general anti- modernistic spirit of the 1930s, the acquisitions from the 1920s up to the outbreak of the Second World War took a decisively modern tack. In 1934, the public art collection added its first painting by Vincent van Gogh along with an ensemble of 134 drawings by Paul Cézanne. Founded in 1933, the Emanuel Hoffmann Foundation supported the Kunstmuseum in these efforts and took up residence in the facility with its works of contemporary art in 1940. The breakthrough in altering the overall profile came with the special funding credit provided by the Basel-City parliament in 1939 at the instigation of museum director Georg Schmidt for the purchase of German museum holdings that the National Socialists had vilified as “degenerate art”.Not obtained from private collections, none of the 21 acquired pieces had to be restituted after the war. Kreis, Georg (1997). Die Schweiz und der Handel mit Raubkunst im Zusammenhang mit dem Zweiten Weltkrieg. Homme aux bras écartés on Picasso Square behind the Kunstmuseum, 2008The naming of the square followed a gift of four paintings by Pablo Picasso in appreciation of the positive referendum vote on the city’s purchase of two of his paintings. The establishment of classical modernism at the Kunstmuseum continued with ongoing acquisitions of postwar-era art, in particular with works by American artists. In Basel's claim to being a “Museum City”, the highly controversial and unsuccessful referendum against the purchase of two Picasso paintings in 1967 holds considerable importance and constitutes a key moment in Basel's culture of remembrance in regard to the fusing of society and museum.Monteil, Annemarie (1977). Basler Museen. Birkhäuser Publishing, Basel, pp. 13–14.  Democratization, popularization  Despite the affirmation by voters, traditional museums found themselves in a prolonged crisis beginning in the late 1960s. Not limited to Basel, this crisis originated in the profound sociopolitical reevaluation of culture of the era. The acquisitions of the State Art Credit and the 1967 Christmas exhibition at Kunsthalle Basel set off fierce protests among the loosely organized association of rejected artists, which became known as the Farnsburg Group (Farnsburgergruppe). Even the cantonal parliament got involved in addressing the concerns. The events raised the question of whether Basel was “just a museum city” – here meant in a derogatory sense – and prompted a broadly cast debate over the fostering of young artists and the functioning of the museums. The establishment of the Klingental Exhibition Gallery (Ausstellungsraum Klingental) several years later was a direct consequence of the shortcomings that had been identified. Historical Museum: The hall of the Barfüsser Church open to passers-by, 2008 The democratization that took hold in the 1960s meant doing away with the elite in favor of the egalitarian, dispelling fears of the new and unknown. With a focus on the constructivist works of the 1960s associated with the “New Tendencies” (Nouvelles Tendances) movement, the short-lived Progressive Museum (1968–1974) set out to “establish a modern collection that would be accessible to the public from the very beginning” and wanted to avoid any sort of “secularized ceremony”.History of the Progressive Museum The expansion of education and communication, likewise a mandate stemming from this era, could only be achieved through an increase in funding. Since the mid-1970s, however, increasingly tight budgets and persistent financial difficulties in the public sector have exerted a palpable impact on museums. The museum studies program at the University of Basel could only be offered from 1992 to 1994 due to funding shortages. In the mid-1990s, a government resolution cut the budget of the state museums by ten percent, leading to the 1996 closure of two museums, the Museum of Design (Museum für Gestaltung) and the City and Cathedral Museum (Stadt- und Münstermuseum).Suter, Raphael (1996). \\"Die Schliessung zweier Museen stösst auf Widerstand.\\" Basler Stadtbuch 1995, pp. 158–161.Suter, Raphael (1996). \\"Ist das erste Museologie-Studium der Schweiz bereits am Ende?\\" Basler Stadtbuch 1995, pp. 109–111. The ensuing debate and the pressure from a public referendum in support of the city's museums led to the adoption of the Basel-City Museums Act (Museumsgesetz) of 1999, which placed the holdings of the remaining five state museums (Museum of Ancient Art, Historical Museum, Kunstmuseum, Museum of Cultures, Natural History Museum) in the hands of the parliament. As a central component of cultural expenditures,The museums of Basel-City make up around a third of the canton’s annual culture budget of approximately a hundred million francs. See the 2009 Basel-City Culture Budget. the museums have also been included in the intensified negotiations over the past several years between the two Basel cantons regarding payment for the city-provided services within the framework of a fiscal equalization scheme. Vitra Design Museum – Fire Station (architect: Zaha Hadid) Since the 1980s, the museums have experienced simultaneous trends toward popularization and aestheticization. The ensuing decades have been marked by a wave of new museum buildings whose avant-garde architecture has achieved international prominence. Contributing considerably to popularization was the exhibition concept of the Musée Sentimental, which focuses on the world of un-prosaic everyday culture and experience and led to a 1989 exhibition of the same name at the Museum of Design (Museum für Gestaltung). The annual Basel Museum Night tallies around a hundred thousand museum visits while the museums attract a total of approximately 1.4 million visitors throughout the year (as of 2006).Visitor figures of the museums in the canton of Basel-City According to the Statistical Office of Canton Basel- City, the Basel museums have the following visitor figures: 1,745,142 in 2004, 1,202,959 in 2005, 1,334,031 in 2006. The general population credits the museums with “a leading role in providing leisure-time opportunities for education and learning”.Governing Council of Canton Basel-City: Politikplan 2008–2011, p. 9. Museums operate in an environment that is increasingly subject to the conditions of both the leisure market and the free market, and are recognized as an important economic and locational factor.Visitors figures of the museums in Basel-City. Attracting 600,000 visitors, the Tutankhamen exhibition at the Museum of Ancient Art boosted overnight hotel stays in Basel hotels by around 6% in 2004.Study by the Human Geography Institute (Humangeographisches Institut) of the University of Basel By conservative estimates, the Basel museums generate added value of at least 41 million francs per year (up to just under 55 million francs including the Museum am Burghof and the Vitra Design Museum). In contrast to the state, the use of private funds in the museum field has grown considerably. Funding from patrons or sponsors plays an increasingly significant role in the financing of exhibitions, parts of collections or entire museums and is thus highly sought after. This competitive situation is further reflected in the considerable institutional autonomy of the Basel-City museums, which are the only governmental enterprises in the canton operating under the private-sector influenced method of New Public Management.Museums Act (Museumsgesetz) from 16 June 1999, §§ 6, 9, 14.

Birmingham Museum of Art, Birmingham, Alabama Helen Venetia Vincent, Viscountess D'Abernon (née Duncombe; 6 March 18661939 England and Wales Register – 16 May 1954) was a British noblewoman, socialite and diarist. Early life Lady Helen was born at 20 Grosvenor Square, Mayfair, London, the daughter of William Duncombe and Mabel Violet Graham. The family seat was at Duncombe Park in Helmsley, North Yorkshire, England. Her father was elevated to the peerage as Baron Feversham in 1867 and again as Earl of Feversham in 1868. She and her sister, Hermione, Duchess of Leinster, were renowned as leading beauties in their circle. Marriage Helen married Sir Edgar Vincent, then a governor of the Imperial Ottoman Bank in Constantinople on 24 September 1890. In 1899 he was elected a Member of Parliament for Exeter. Lady Helen, in that period, was \\"the most celebrated hostess of her age and was 'by reason of her outstanding beauty, intelligence and charm, one of the most resplendent figures'\\".Rintoul, M. C. (1993) Dictionary of Real People and Places in Fiction. London: Taylor & Francis. p. 919.

She is believed to have been the model for the characters of Lady Thisbe Crowborough in Max Beerbohm's story Hilary Maltby and Stephen Braxton in Seven Men (1919) and for Lady Irene Silvester in Maurice Baring's story \\"A Luncheon Party\\" (1925). In 1904 during an extended visit to Venice, Lady Helen's portrait was painted by John Singer Sargent.

Many letters describing her war work were sent to her friend Teresa Hulton, later the 8th Lady Berwick of Attingham Park. Lady Helen accompanied her husband (created 1st Baron D'Abernon in 1914) as he served on the Interallied Mission to Poland and as the British Ambassador to the Weimar Republic in the early 1920s.

It celebrated the 50th anniversary of the passing of the Nineteenth Amendment, which effectively gave American women the right to vote.Gourley, Catherine. Ms. and the Material Girl: Perceptions of Women from the 1970s to the 1990s. 1st. Minneapolis, MN: Twenty-First Century Books, 2008. 5–20. Print. The rally was sponsored by the National Organization for Women (NOW). About 50,000 women gathered for the protest in New York City and even more throughout the country. At this time, the gathering was the largest on behalf of women in the United States. The strike, spearheaded by Betty Friedan, self-stated three primary goals: free abortion on demand, equal opportunity in the workforce, and free childcare. The strike also advocated for other second wave feminist goals more generally, such as political rights for women, and social equality in relationships such as marriage. Historical context At the time of the protest, women still did not enjoy many of the same freedoms and rights as men. Despite the passage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963, which prohibited pay discrimination between two people who performed the same job, women comparatively earned 59 cents for every dollar a man made for similar work. Women were also restricted in terms of their access to higher education. For example, Harvard University did not admit women until 1977. And regardless of education, women were generally channeled into one of four occupational choices: secretarial, nursing, teaching, or motherhood. Sandra Day O'Connor, the first female Associate Justice of the US Supreme Court, who graduated at the top of her class from Stanford Law School, was offered only secretarial jobs in Los Angeles law firms despite her prestigious degree. In 43 states, women were limited in the number of hours they could work and the amount of weight they could carry (generally no more than , the size of a toddler, as some feminists noted). In many states, women were also unable to obtain credit cards, make wills, or own property without a husband.Douglas, Susan J. Where the Girls Are: Growing Up Female with the Mass Media. New York, New York: Three Rivers Press, 1994. 163–180. Print. The right to serve on a jury was denied to women in some states. Organization Feminist Betty Jameson Armistead sent a letter to Betty Friedan and others proposing the strike. Betty Friedan, writer of The Feminine Mystique, and a leader of second-wave feminism, then planned the protest to commemorate the anniversary of landmark legislation, and spotlight current battles. She said the movement was in need of \\"something big, something so big it will make national headlines\\". Friedan initially proposed the strike to the National Organization for Women, an organization which she had helped found. Members were hesitant, however, fearful that the protest would not be successful, and could create a mockery of their movement.\\"Nation: Women on the March.\\" Time Magazine September 7, 1970. Web. November 6, 2009. Friedan continued to develop a strategy, months in advance, despite the negative reception. The initial planning meeting was small and chaotic; planners sat in a circle and discussed possible strategies without a real leader or any formal organization. The meeting produced nothing tangible or relevant. As the plans progressed, so did the controversy. In the final month leading up to the event, the group was significantly divided into two factions: the young \\"radical, crazies\\" and the \\"bourgeoisie\\" founders. Eventually, Friedan prevailed, avoiding deep divisions by recruiting women and men, liberals and conservatives alike.Bazelon, Emily. \\"The Mother of Feminism.\\" The New York Times. December 31, 2006. Web. November 5, 2009. Friedan sought permission from the city of New York to close Fifth Avenue for the protest. The city refused. The strike Despite the setback, women gathered on the streets at around 5 pm (chosen so that working women could attend) and began protesting. The New York action included chanting and speeches by prominent figures (including Friedan), as well as signs and posters. Crowd estimates put somewhere between ten and twenty thousand people, mostly women, gathered on Fifth Avenue. Police attempted to keep the crowd restricted to one lane of traffic, but the sheer volume of people was impossible to control and they spread across the street from sidewalk to sidewalk. Thousands of politically and satirically charged signs dotted the crowd. \\"Don't iron while the strike is hot\\" set the stage as the protest's famous slogan. Others included: \\"Hardhats for Soft Broads\\", \\"I Am Not a Barbie Doll\\", \\"Storks Fly – Why Can't Mothers\\", \\"We are the 51% minority\\", and the sardonic \\"We have the right to vote for the man of our choice\\". Speeches were given to ignite the crowd and inform bystanders. Friedan spoke of the strength and ability of women to rise above their oppression. The strike's goals were to publicize the feminist movement and ideas and to expose the injustices experienced by women. In conjunction with the New York City action, individuals and groups throughout the nation staged protests, marches, and other various forms of revolt to honor the movement. One example occurred in Boston, where around 5,000 women gathered in Boston Common and 1,000 went on to march into downtown Boston. A noon rally also drew around 2,000 people in San Francisco's Union Square. About 125 women marched on City Hall in Syracuse, N. Y., and in Manhasset, L. I., women gathered signatures on a peti tion urging Senate passage of the Equal Rights Amendment. In Detroit, women staged a sit-in in a men's restroom protesting unequal facilities for men and women staffers. In Pittsburgh, four women threw eggs at a radio host who dared them to show their liberation. One thousand women in Washington, D.C. staged a march down Connecticut Avenue behind a banner reading \\"We Demand Equality\\"; in the same city, government workers organized a peaceful protest and staged a \\"teach-in\\", which educated people about the injustices done to women, mindful that it was against the law for government workers to strike. \\"Silent vigils\\" held in Los Angeles drew meager crowds of only 500. In Minneapolis, women gathered and staged guerrilla theater involving key figures in the national abortion debate, and stereotypical roles of women in American society. Women were portrayed as mothers and wives; doing dishes, rearing children and doting obnoxiously on their husbands, all while wearing heels and aprons.Larana, Enrique, Hank Johnston, and Joseph Gusfield. New Social Movements: From Ideology to Identity. 1st. Philadelphia, PA: Temple University, 1994. 250–275. Print. Approximately 100 women participating in the strike also marched down Kiener 5 Memorial Plaza in Saint Louis as well. Though gaining less media attention than the public demonstrations, another component of the protest was a one-day strike from work. Betty Friedan had asked that \\"the women who are doing menial chores in the offices as secretaries put the covers on their typewriters, [...] the waitresses stop waiting, cleaning women stop cleaning and everyone who is doing a job for which a man would be paid more stop [working].\\" Striking from work was intended to highlight unequal pay as well as limited job opportunities for women. In addition to refusing to perform paid labor on this day, women across the country were also asked to refrain from any household chores. By refusing to cook or clean, they were attempting to emphasize the unequal distribution of household work among the sexes. However, because of the nature of striking from unpaid labor, it is unclear how many women participated. Despite initial obstacles and setbacks, Friedan declared the event a success. Including the protests and demonstrations throughout the country, she proclaimed, \\"It exceeded my wildest dreams. It's now a political movement and the message is clear\\". Reactions and media coverage The strike received extensive local and national attention, both positive and negative. In opposition, some women called for the \\"National Celebration of Womanhood\\", a day dedicated to women dressing in \\"frilly\\", feminine clothing, singing while doing the laundry, and cooking breakfast in bed for their husbands. Other women simply watched the protest, unsure of its implications or what exactly the protest was about. One woman in the crowd was quoted as saying, \\"I don't know what these women are thinking of. I love the idea of looking delectable and having men whistle at me.\\" Many media outlets questioned the validity of the protest. CBS news quoted a poll that found two- thirds of American women did not feel they were oppressed. News anchor Eric Sevareid compared the feminist movement to an infectious disease and ended his report claiming that the women of the movement were nothing more than \\"a band of braless bubbleheads\\". Many feminists were angry and dismayed by the language used by major media outlets to describe their movement, as many claimed the reporting was biased and condescending, focusing primarily on the rage of the women in the march and not the overall message. ABC continued to fuel the anger when reporter Howard K. Smith publicly spoke against the movement, denying its credibility and claiming a lack of evidence for the cause. The women's movement subsequently engaged in a media backlash, boycotting the four major corporations whose advertising and broadcasting they found to be offensive and degrading. ABC eventually retracted Smith's statement. Smith later clarified that he did not support women's liberation because, in his view, women were already liberated. \\"Women dominate our elections; they probably own most of the nation's capital wealth; any man who thinks he, and not his wife, runs his family is dreaming,\\" he said. Not all media attention, however, was negative. President Richard Nixon issued a proclamation acknowledging the credibility of the movement and designated the anniversary of women's suffrage as \\"Women's Equality Day\\" at the behest of House Rep. Bella Abzug. Time Magazine also supported the cause and published a series of articles highlighting the issues of the movement. The significance of the protest was vast for its supporters. Feminists and scholars claimed that the strike was a significant spark for second wave feminism, owing to the protest's high profile in the media and the country.

History Between the 1890s and the 1910s, many new homes were constructed in the neighborhood for Bohemian immigrants. Areas with Bohemian owners included the 1500 block of North Durham Street, 1700 block of Crystal Street, 1700 block of North Register Street, 1100 and 1500 blocks of North Bradford Street, and 1700 and 1800 blocks of North Chapel Street. Czech-American building and loans associations helped Bohemians purchase these homes. Many of the Bohemians attended mass at St. Wenceslaus, a Bohemian Roman Catholic parish in the nearby neighborhood of Little Bohemia. During the 1950s, the area of the neighborhood surrounding North Milton Avenue and North Luzerne Avenue was primarily Polish, German, and Irish.

It officially took over these activities from the National Scrabble Association (NSA) on July 1, 2009. Mission statement and motto NASPA's mission statement is: :“We are a community of tournament, club and avid home players of the SCRABBLE® Brand Crossword Game. We foster an atmosphere for people of all skill levels to play their favorite game, improve their abilities and above all, meet people who share a similar love of the game.” Its motto is: :\\"Making words, building friendships\\"  Activities  NASPA has organized an annual National Scrabble Championship (NSC) since 2009, most recently held in Reno, Nevada in July 2019. In 2015 the championship was officially renamed the North American Scrabble Championship (NASC). Its committees and officers do a number of things, including: * Edit the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary * Edit the Official Tournament and Club Word List. * Edit the official Scrabble tournament rules. * Maintain the official rating system. * Sanction hundreds of tournaments each year * Act as the disciplinary body for players and directors. * Maintain a roster of officially sanctioned clubs, and certify club and tournament directors. * Determine policy that affects club and tournament play, and hears appeals to the decisions of other committees. * The Canadian Committee oversees matters that pertain solely to Canadian NASPA members, such as organizing the Canadian National Scrabble Championship tournament.  History  The National Scrabble Association (NSA) began promoting school, recreational and adult tournament Scrabble in the late 1970s with financial support from Hasbro. In 2008 Hasbro decided to stop supporting adult tournament Scrabble and clubs by the end of 2009. A meeting arranged by the NSA and Hasbro executives was held at Hasbro headquarters in suburban Springfield, Massachusetts in December 2008. It was attended by prominent Scrabble players, club and tournament directors, and others from across the continent, including John Chew, Chris Cree, Joe Edley, Ira Freehof, Matt Hopkins, Robert Kahn, Katya Lezin, Seth Lipkin, Mad Palazzo, Steve Pellinen, Mary Rhoades, John Robertson, Sherrie Saint John, Debbie Stegman, Alan Stern, and David Weiss. The attendees were offered the opportunity to form a new organization to preserve competitive adult Scrabble in North America, and encouraged to do so with Hasbro's blessing but without any funding. The NSA would continue to exist, but would largely focus on its school Scrabble program and promoting recreational play. (It ceased operations on July 1, 2013.) Most of the 16 attendees accepted Hasbro's challenge and formed the nucleus of the steering committee. An email vote by the steering committee's members determined the new organization's name: The North American Scrabble Players Association (NASPA). NASPA was registered in Texas as a not- for-profit corporation and headquartered in Dallas. Chris Cree of Dallas and John Chew of Toronto emerged as co-presidents. Hasbro gave NASPA until the end of 2009 to establish control of the competitive tournament scene, but it was ready for the transition six months early. Accordingly, the first NASPA tournament games were played on July 1, 2009, in three different cities. NASPA adopted a stricter Code of Conduct, with the goal of improving players' and officials' deportment at Scrabble events. Punishments for misbehavior and cheating at tournaments and clubs have been much swifter and harsher than in the past. NASPA receives no operational funding from Hasbro, relying on membership fees, as well as \\"participation fees\\" collected by tournament directors, calculated at a fixed rate based on the number of tournament games played. As of July 1, 2009, NASPA became the only group in North America permitted to use the registered Scrabble name and trademark in adult club and tournament play. Other organizations such as the Word Game Players' Organization have existed since 2010 and run tournaments, but are careful not to infringe. NASPA membership types NASPA membership is mandatory for anyone who wishes to compete in sanctioned NASPA tournament play. There are several categories of membership: * One-year regular adult * One-year youth (under 18) * Six-month trial * One-week * Life As of June 2013, NASPA had more than 2,500 dues-paid members.

People eat spring pancakes on the day called lichun to celebrate the beginning of the spring. The spring pancake took its rise from the Jin dynasty and has prospered since the Tang dynasty. The lichun was valued by both Chinese ancient kings and civilians. Unlike kings’ great celebrations, civilians celebrated the lichun by eating spring pancakes wrapped around fresh vegetables and meat, which is called bite-the-spring. Bite-the-spring implies that civilians are praying for a good harvest year through eating the fresh vegetables and meat at the beginning of spring. In the Qing dynasty, spring pancakes became a fried pancake wrapped around a filling that included ham, chicken, pork, black dates, scallions, walnuts and sugar. In addition, spring pancakes were one of the nine desserts for the regal banquet of Qing dynasty. The spring pancake is slightly larger than the pancake that is served with Peking duck. The wrapped, filled pancakes were in later times fried and served as what are called spring rolls.

The Society of Humanitarianism (Maatschappij van Weldadigheid) was a Dutch private organization set up in 1818 by general Johannes van den Bosch to help poor families, mostly from the big cities, improve their lot in the aftermath of the Napoleonic French occupation by granting them farming land. He petitioned William I of the Netherlands for its formation and bought uncultivated land in Drenthe for the poor to exploit. The Estate 'Westerbeeksloot' in what is now Frederiksoord was the society's administrative center. Free Colonies The Society then built permanent colonies consisting of small colony houses with a little ground. Those houses were regularly spaced along straight roads. The colonies I and II were later transformed into the village Frederiksoord, the other colonies to the villages Wilhelminaoord and Boschoord (in Southwest Drenthe) and Willemsoord (in Northwest Overijssel). Here were about 1400 families collected in the period 1818-1911. To educate the population and safeguarding of bad influences, the Society founded its own schools and they implemented “'colony money”. That money did not exist long, but the schools did. In addition to elementary schools, the Society also founded vocational training schools which operated from 1829 to 1859 as the 'Institute for Agriculture' in Wateren and the “Gerard Adriaan van Swieten” horticultural and forestry school in Frederiksoord and the ”Gerard Adriaan van Swieten” Agricultural School in 1884 in Willemsoord. The foundation of these schools was made possible by a donation from the former major of cavalry, F.H. L.van Swieten. [3]. The horticultural school moved to Meppel in November 2005. Trial Colony Johannes van den Bosch went energetically to work. On August 25, 1818 - one week after the purchase of the property by the Estate Westerbeeksloot - he laid the foundation stone for the first settlers home. On October 29, 1818, the first families arrived in the colony, which was still a “trial colony”. A total of 52 families from all parts of the country \\"chosen\\" to participate in the experiment of Johannes van den Bosch. After four and a half years, there were still 42 families under the care of the Society of Humanitarianism. A large part of them lived there until their death Their adventures are described by Wil Schackmann in \\"De Proefkolonie\\"[2]. Renegade Colonies Some, especially younger - ousted from the colony settled in the vicinity in hastily built sod huts and formed the so-called renegade-like colonies in near Nijensleek and Vledderveen (which originates from the renegate colonies), North or South Wolde-Marijenkampen (at Steenwijk) and Noordwolde. [5] Poverty reduction in the 19th century  The Netherlands was severely depleted in the early nineteenth century, after the French domination. Many families lived in the cities and in the countryside in sorrowful situations. It has been the merit of Johannes van den Bosch, he recognized this problem and that he actually took steps to try to eradicate poverty. Eventually his project suffered depletion, because he always had to borrow to keep the Colonies in state money because of the disappointing yields. For the settlers, being placed in the so-called \\"free colonies\\" meant a great intervention in their lives. Many were from the big city 'transplanted' in an unfamiliar environment to them as the Drenthe countryside. Some managed to save well but others went back to the place of origin.The settler Peter Arends found that life in the colony was mirrored as being better than it really was. When he complained about this in a letter to his sister the director in charge of the colony (Benjamin van den Bosch, brother of John) got to hear about this and gave him in a big scolding from called him \\"a big stupid sloth. Eventually Arends was still able to become a free farmer in Ommerschans. [6] Criticism of the colonies The initiative of Johannesvan den Bosch received the strongest criticism from conservative Christian angle. In particular, the Reveil movement felt that man was not allowed to intervene God’s designated plan. Dirk van Hogendorp, pupil of Willem Bilderdijk, who visited the colonies with his friend Jacob van Lennep, felt that the Society of Humanitarianism, because it was not a religious organization, would not last long. Also Isaac da Costa and Ottho Gerhard Heldringstraat were fierce fighters of the ideas of Van den Bosch. In their view, the poor and needy were a natural part of society so that the rich and wealthy could show their mercy as a token of Christian charity. Penal colonies Veenhuizen (second institution), now a museum in Veenhuizen and Ommerschans penal colonies were established. Vagrants and beggars were locked up here and put to work. But settlers could also settle here. The punishment was for alcohol abuse, sexual abuse, waste, brutality or desertion. In 1859 the colonies were taken over by the Dutch state. In 1890 Ommerschans was closed. Veenhuizen is now an ordinary prison. From 1896 to 1901 the description sheet was introduced in Veenhuizen. The creator of this system was the Frenchman Alphonse Bertillon (1853-1917). He was of the opinion that on basis of accurate measurements, the identity of the individual could be recorded. On this simple theoretical principle Bertillon built a complicated identification method, in which body measurements were central. Because human individuals cannot be described in numbers only, additional descriptions on the description sheet were necessary. Southern Netherlands Following the Drenthe colonies there were also colonies developed with similar initiatives in the Southern Netherlands . In Wortel a free colony in 1822 and in Merplas an unfree colony was founded by Johannes van den Bosch. The colony in Wortel was completely demolished after the Belgian Revolution. This location was a tramp institution established in 1881, which still has limited service as such today. The colony of Merksplas is now a prison and a center for rejected asylum seekers. Present Day In the 20th century residential schools for \\"unsocials\\" were established in the major cities. The Society for Humanitarians was transformed into a foundation, which is responsible for the management of 1400 acres of cultured and forestry land, including a part of the National Park Drents-Friese Wold. In the museum “De Koloniehof” in Frederiksoord the Society shows what life in the colonies was like. There is a database with the names of persons who lived as settlers or as officers in the colonies or who worked there. In Veenhuizen the National Prison Museum is located in a former work institution at Oude Gracht 1.

Rader (born 1938) is an American psychiatrist. After an early career treating eating disorders, he founded several offshore clinics administering injections of human fetal stem cells claiming clinically- unproven therapeutic benefits for a variety of illnesses. Rader's assertions about the effectiveness of his injections, coupled with high-pressure sales tactics, aroused intense criticism. Complaints by patients led to the revocation of his medical license in California. Biography Rader graduated with an M.D. from the State University of New York in 1967. He did his psychiatric fellowship at the University of Southern California Medical Center. He was a psychiatrist for the Navy's alcoholism treatment program from 1971 to 1973. Rader was married and had three children prior to marrying Sally Struthers, with whom he had a daughter. He co-wrote a 1977 episode of the television sitcom All in the Family and became involved with Struthers' negotiations with television executives. The couple divorced on January 18, 1983 in Los Angeles. Rader was a medical expert for KABC Eyewitness News in Los Angeles from 1977 to 1991. Newsweek described Rader as \\"a highly telegenic Beverly Hills psychiatrist\\" and called his five-part debut on KABC about compulsive overeating \\"riveting\\". In 1981, Rader published a book titled No Diet Program For Permanent Weight Loss. In 1984 he started The Rader Institute to treat eating disorders. In 1992, he started the Survivor Program to help victims of sexual abuse. He founded the Immune Suppressed Institute in 1993, an HIV/AIDS treatment center, in Mexico City. Stem cells Rader first observed the human injection of fetal stem cells in the mid-1990s at a Ukrainian clinic. In 1995, he began referring his own US patients to Ukraine for fetal stem cell treatment. Rader's first independent stem cell clinic was established in the Bahamas; the clinic reopened in the Dominican Republic after the Bahamian government asked Rader to leave in 2000 following a critical television report aired in the United States. Rader operated multiple stem cell marketing entities over the years including The Dulcinea Institute, Medra, Inc., and Stem Cell of America, Inc., continuing to maintain the latter's website and California office after he lost his medical license. In 2008, Rader claimed in a telephone interview that his stem cell product was obtained from a laboratory in the Republic of Georgia. Rader has never published studies or results of his treatments in medical journals. In 2009, the journal Science called Rader \\"particularly notorious\\" among unregulated offshore stem cell providers for his \\"extraordinary claims\\" and \\"refus[al] to share information on cell lines and techniques.\\" Vol. 323. no. 5921, pp. 1564-1565. \\"Medra became particularly notorious for the extraordinary claims made by its founder, psychiatrist William Rader, who has refused to share information on cell lines and techniques he claims can be used for treatment of conditions including spinal cord injury and Down syndrome.\\" Rader, who uses the same stem cell treatment no matter what the patient's ailment, said of his injection process, \\"I'm not telling a cell where to go, because I have no clue where it should go. This is nature, God's work. Whatever you want to call it.\\" Dr. Evan Snyder, director of stem cell research at the Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute in La Jolla, California, responded, \\"[t]hat's not a therapy, that's snake oil.\\" In 2009, the BBC's current affairs program Panorama aired an episode in which it investigated claims of Rader's high- pressure sales tactics.

It is now a maritime museum, housing the Dutch Navy Museum and the Nationaal Reddingmuseum Dorus Rijkers. In 2009 the replica of the Dutch East India Company ship Prins Willem which was located in a dock (visitable by the public) burned down.  Nieuwediep harbor: Origin of the naval base  The Nieuwediep with the dams that made it a deep harbor, also note the Nieuwe Werk of 1792 on the right. In the seventeenth and eighteenth century it became increasingly difficult for big ships to regularly sail to the Dutch cities on the Zuiderzee. Many ships therefore anchored in the Roadstead of Texel were a lot of Transloading was done by small ships that anchored safely in the Nieuwediep. The Nieuwediep was a stretch of deep water close to the coast near what would later become Den Helder, and was well protected by a shoal. The importance of a protected base for the Dutch navy was stressed again by the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War. The Nieuwediep was an ideal location, but not deep enough for warships and East Indies ships because there was a bump in the mouth of the Nieuwediep. A plan to make a useful and safe harbor for warships in the Nieuwediep was made by: Captain W. May equipage master of the Amsterdam Admiralty; C. Brunings, inspector general of the rivers; Surveyor B. Goudriaan, L. de Berge and P. Haage. They specified that such a harbor: should be big enough to lay ships at a sufficient distance from each other, should keep the ships safe from weather and Ice shove, should be deep 20 feet deep at ebb at the entrance, and 24 feet at ebb at the mooring places. The Nieuwediep only lacked the required depth. On 6 and 27 August 1781 a Commission was then mandated and ordered to execute this plan. On 5 September 1781 orders were given to create a stone dam east of the Nieuwdiep that would guide the ebb flow for 348,500 guilders. It was to be built in three parts (cf the map) The first part, the 'big stone and wood dam' (Groote Rijs en Steenen dam) was 475 meter long. The second part, a slate dam (Dutch: Lijdam) was 655 m long. The third part (Dutch: Keerdam) stretched east to catch the ebb flow and was 2260 m long. The second part was ready on schedule in June 1782. The delivery of the other parts was delayed by the difficulties in shipping the heavy stones required. In October 1782 the third part was finished, the first part following a few weeks later. Nevertheless, the first effects were shown when in August 1782 the bump in the mouth of the Nieuwediep was found to have been lowered by 1-1.5 feet. In October 1782 orders were then given to dredge out a way through the bump by December 1782. This became March 1783, but in April the depth had indeed reached 19 and more feet, and some armed warships had already anchored in the harbor. In June 1783 33,000 guilders were spent for a dam (lijdam) of 500 m stretching SSW from the southern entrance of the Nieuwediep, creating a funnel together with part 3. To facilitate ships, 8,800 guilders were spent on 7 dolphins (cf map). 58,000 guilders was reserved for further dredging, that (after delays) would be executed in 1784. Nieuwediep immediately became a harbor that was important for commerce. Traditionally many ships were reluctant to sail to the Zuiderzee in the winter, because ice would often block the harbors. Now they could sail to Nieuwediep, that was ice-free most of the winter. In the winter of 1783-1784 60-70 loaded ships wintered in Nieuwediep, safe from ice. It led to the creation of some more facilities for 30,000 guilders in 1784. A specific advantage was that ships from the south, loaded with perishable goods like fruits, could unload at Nieuwdiep. In the winter of 1784-1785 there were 150 ships at Nieuwediep, among them merchant men with a draft of 18–20 feet laying somewhat at the bottom of the harbor. The transloading business also changed. It became safer because it could now be done in port, but it also became cheaper, because it took less time. For big warships the depth was still not enough. Therefore, in 1785 the third part of the eastern dam was prolonged by 750 m, and then by another piece of 376 m stretching to the south west. In 1785 the ships of the line wintered in Nieuwediep. Still, Nieuwediep was nothing more than a harbor. It lacked facilities like stores and repair shops, that would make it a real naval base.  Nieuwediep becomes a naval base  The Nieuwediep with the Battery and the Nieuwe Werk in 1810.  Batteries  In 1792 small field fortications were made on the north side of the Nieuwediep. By 1793 there was a battery called Princes of Orange. It had 28 24-pounders and was situated on the Kaaphoofd, west of Den Helder. Between Den Helder and the Nieuwediep at the mouth of the Nieuwediep, there was a battery of 11 24-pounders called Erfprinses (later called 'Unie'). In 1793 there were also the guardship Prinses Louisa of 54 guns, the hulk Hyena with 20 18-pounders, and some gunboats.  The Nieuwe Werk  Also in 1792 a repair facility was founded called 'Het Nieuwe Werk'. It was also called the 'Kielplaats' (Dutch for careening place). It had a lock. Ships could get in at high tide, and be pulled on their side at low tide and remain so till careening was finished. This was a very sensitive project. Careening was one thing, it was often done in all kinds of places. The logical follow up would be a repair shop with stores, something that the cities on the Zuiderzee (incl. Amsterdam) vehemently opposed. Of course they feared that one thing would lead to another, first a naval base with facilities, and then commerce itself flowing to Nieuwediep. After the Batavian Revolution the national interest somewhat prevailed over local interests. On 20 July 1795 the national committee for the navy ordered the construction of a house, three wooden storehouses, and a building suitable for a smithy. All were to be erected within the confines of the Nieuwe Werk. Note that particular interests still succeeded in limiting the buildings.  The Anglo-Russian invasion  In 1799 the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland led to the capture of Nieuwediep and the Nieuwe Werk on 29 August after both had been evacuated. By then the English found 95 guns and many supplies in the Nieuwe Werk. They also captured many ships: the ships of the line: Verwachting (66), Broederschap (55) and Hector (44); the frigates: Helder (32), Jollock (24), Minerva (24), Venus (24), Alarm (24) and the two-decks East Indies ships: Duifje (12), Expeditie (16), Constitutie (12), Schoone Antoinette (12), Unie (12) and four single- deck ships, all of them without crew. Seeing the Orange flags in Nieuwediep probably had a big influence on the Vlieter incident of 30 August. A Dutch fleet of eight ships of the line and four frigates, now separated from its base, mutinied and surrendered without firing a shot.  Fortified base Nieuwediep   Den Helder gets fortified  The Dutch authorities now realized that a fleet could only be safe in Nieuwediep if it was also protected on the land side. Already in 1803 the old village of Den Helder was fortified. The tip of the Nieuwediep (including battery De Unie) was somewhat surrounded by walls, and field fortifications were erected to protect the other coastal batteries on the land side. The Nieuwe Werk also got some guns. This was not enough to protect the base against a serious attack, but funds were limited. The light fortifications did not protect against a siege, but they did protect against a raid. In 1807 king Louis Bonaparte visited the base and also saw the potential of the position. Meanwhile, operations continued in Nieuwediep. Warehouses were restored etc.  Napoleon visits Nieuwediep  In 1811 Napoleon Bonaparte visited Den Helder. He concurred with all previous authorities that Nieuwediep had great strategic potential as a base. The difference between him and previous authorities was that he could spend much more. He ordered Jan Blanken Jansz. to build the biggest naval base and maintenance shipyard of the Netherlands. This would later become Willemsoord. The total cost would be 6,000,000 francs for the fortifications, and the same cost for the base and part of the works in Hellevoetsluis. Fortifying the position was the easy part. In a few years a bunch of strong fortresses and fortifications was established centering on Den Helder. While work on a new base at what would later become Willemsoord was started in 1811, daily operations continued at the Nieuwe Werk. Napoleon gave an impulse to the Nieuwe Werk when he decreed that all repairs that could be done at Lorient (a harbor that like Nieuwdiep had a strong current and no dock) should also be done in Nieuwediep. That is ships should not be sent to Medemblik for such repairs. In 1812 the ships of the line Zoutman and Prince were repaired in Nieuwediep while the crew was lodged on board the old East Indies ship Constitution.  Siege of Den Helder  In 1813 the fortifications of Den Helder were so powerful that the French were able to maintain themselves in Den Helder when the Dutch threw of the French yoke. It led to the Siege of Den Helder in November 1813. At the time the Dutch fleet in Den Helder, the so- called squadron of Texel consisted of; the ships of the line: Prince (80), Zoutman (80), De Ruyter (80), Evertsen (80) and Doggersbank; the frigates Meuse (44) and Ijssel (44) (both with French crews); the corvette Venus and the Brig Irene, as well as the French brig Iréne. In port and not ready were the ships of the line: Amsterdam (80), Brabant (76), Jean de Witt (68) and Rotterdam (68), and the frigates Aurora / Dageraad (32) and Maria Reijgersbergen (32). When the Bourbons were restored, the squadron of Texel came into Dutch hands again.  Continued operation of Nieuwediep till 1822  When the independence of the Netherlands was re-established the base of Nieuwediep continued as one of the national naval bases. This meant that the harbor and the 'Nieuwe Werk' continued in operation while the works on Willemsoord were in execution. During its heyday the Nieuwe Werk would employ up to 700 men. It would continue in operation till about 1822. Part of it is now Fortress Oostoever.  Rijkswerf Willemsoord  Willemsoord in full operation (1920-1940), the Nieuwediep is on the top right The other part of Napoleon's orders encompassed the establishment of a much more serious naval base. Like Vlisssingen and Hellevoetsluis the new base would have a wet dock and a dry dock. It would be situated right on the exit of the Nieuwediep, and design was ready in 1811. After the Netherlands regained their independence construction continued, and the new base got the name Willemsoord. The base was generally known as 'Rijkswerf Willemsoord'. What set her apart from the other shipyards designated as 'Rijkswerf' was that she was primarily a maintenance and equipment shipyard. Ships that were built at the 'Rijkswerf Amsterdam' would receive their masts, rigging, provisions etc. etc. in Willemsoord. Only a few very minor ships would be built in Willemsoord. In 1822 the first buildings were ready: Dry Dock I, Wet Dock, Sea Sluice, Pump House (with steam engine) and Werfkanaal (Yard Canal). A second wave of construction took place between 1857 and 1866. It comprised the construction of Dry Dock II and a new Pump Building. In the first half of the 20th century the Workbench building, the Kettle factory, the shipmakers workplace, the rigging and sailmakers workshop, magazins and other workshops were built. Historic Docks and Buildings The wet dock The national yard, Dutch 'Rijkswerf' was constructed around a wet dock. The wet dock was dug out by hand from 1812 to 1823. The soil was used to elevate the surrounding grounds. In 1857 the north side of the wet dock was extended by another 30 meters. Nowadays the wet dock is 325 meters long and 135 m wide. Originally it was 8 m deep. The Sea Sluice connected the wet dock to the open sea. In 1972 it was replaced by a bigger sluice. Several notable buildings surround the wet dock. It connects to the two dry docks. Dry Dock I Floating door in Dry Dock I Dry Dock I was designed by Jan Blanken. It's made of stone and was built from 1812 till 1822. It's near Steam Engine Building I, that was built to empty the dry dock. The dry dock was closed by a floating door that has since been replaced. On 13 July 1822 the ship of the line Willem I (formerly Couronne) of 74 guns was successfully placed in the dry dock. After the water was pumped out, the Willem I stood on the bottom of the dock with all its weight. Authorities were very pleased that they had now proven that the foundation could withstand the weight concentrated in the keel, and did not rift and become leaky because of pressures like had happened in France and in England in such situations. These early reports would later prove to be way too optimistic. In reality Dry dock I faced many problems. Already in 1821 it was noted that lower terraces and foundations were getting pushed up. In 1826 a commission under J. Blanken started an investigation and advised to repair the dry dock for 59,297 guilders. In 1827 a contractor demanded 129,000 guilders to do the work, and so the repair was postponed. In 1829 a new estimate of 355,000 guilders was made. By 1830 the estimate had increased to 399,000. By 1834 the Dutch financial situation had become so desperate that nothing was done till 1853. In spite of leakages Dry Dock I continued in use till 1849. During the discussions about the 1855 budget the Secretary for the Navy proposed to follow the advice of a new commission. This advice was to make a stop-gap repair for 6,000 guilders, and then to realize two dry-docks in Nieuwediep for about 1,000,000 guilders. In the budget for 1857 there was 25,000 guilders for making a dam and pumping the water out of the dry dock. During 1857 old masonry of the floor was broken out, and the foundations of the dry dock were investigated. In 1859-1860 a new (and therefore smaller) dry dock was built inside dry dock I. Dry Dock I currently measures 85 by 25 meters on ground level and is about 4 meters deep. The width of the dock decreases incrementally till reaching the bottom of the dock. Dry Dock II Dry Dock II, photograph in the direction of the floating door The idea to create a new (and therefore) second dry dock in Willemsoord came about by the bad condition of Dry Dock I, and the fact that the dry docks in Hellevoetsluis and Vlissingen were too small for the new big ships. In April 1856 the minister for the navy Abraham Johannes de Smit van den Broecke proposed a budget law to raise the naval budget by 200,000 guilders in order to start the realization of dry dock II. This bill was defeated, because the house of representatives thought that a floating dock would be cheaper, nevertheless the minister stayed on by request of the king. De Smit van de Broecke's successor Johannes Servaas Lotsy had more political acumen and did succeed in acquiring the necessary funding. Dry Dock II, also known as the new dry dock, was built from 1857-1866. Just like Dry Dock I it was closed by a floating door, that has since been replaced. Construction of Dry Dock II was troublesome. In August 1860 it unexpectedly filled with water, causing much damage to the masonry. Delivery was then delayed till July 1862. In September, only a few months later, disaster struck. The bottom of the dry dock was pushed up, and many rifts opened, flooding the dock. It took four years to strengthen the construction and to repair the damage. In 1866 Dry Dock II was finally ready. On 27 May 1867 HNLMS Adolf van Nassau (1861) entered Dry Dock II in Willemsoord with all her guns on board, proving that it could handle the heaviest Dutch ships. In 1966 the floor of Dry Dock to was replaced by one made of reinforced concrete. The pumps of Dry Dock II were driven by steam engines, and were housed in 'Gebouw 56' (Building 56). Dry Dock II is 120 meters long by 25 meters wide. The depth of the dock is 8 meters. Steam Engine Building Stoommachinegebouw The steam engine building (stoommachinegebouw) was built from 1813-1823. It was designed by Jan Blanken in neo-classical style. The building was to house a steam engine. Its steam would drive 9 cylindrical pumps to quickly empty dry dock I. A subterraneous sewer connected the building to the dry dock. In 1862 the building became superfluous because of the construction of a new steam engine building for dry dock II. The building was converted to store ironware, and wheat for the naval bakery on the upper levels. In 1889 the lower levels were also converted to wheat stores. It earned it the name 'graanpakhuis', meaning 'wheat storagehouse'. Before and during world war II the building was strengthened with reinforced concrete. In 1942 the roof was also replaced by one of reinforced concrete. In 2004 the building was restored and designated to house the Tourist Office.

History World War II The squadron was originally formed as VMJ-1, and had origins in the earlier VJ-6M. On July 7, 1941 they were redesignated VMJ-152 at Marine Corps Air Station Quantico. They moved to San Diego a few months later and shipped out to the South Pacific on October 10, 1942. They joined Marine Aircraft Group 25 on October 25, 1942, and immediately began flying missions in support of Marines engaged in the Battle of Guadalcanal. In November 1942, the squadron became part of the joint-service South Pacific Combat Air Transport Command. Following this they made numerous supply drops during the New Georgia Campaign in 1943. The squadron was redesignated again to VMR-152 on June 3, 1944. In 1944, the squadron was flying in support of the Battle of Bougainville and would be based on Bougainville for the remainder of the war. From here the squadron also supported allied forces during the Philippines Campaign (1944–45) and the Battle of Okinawa. Following the surrender of Japan, the squadron flew in support of the 1st Marine Division during their occupation of Northern China from 1945 - 1947.

Gifford pioneered the \\"New Approach\\" to railway photography in the 1960s during the declining years of steam. This approach relies heavily on abstraction and sought to encapsulate the dirty working atmosphere of the railway. Early years Gifford was born in London in 1936, and grew up near King's Cross. As a child he had no particular interest in railways – though he lived within walking distance of King's Cross station, he was never a trainspotter. Instead, he positioned himself by the ticket barriers, to better watch the flow of travellers and the bustle of station business as much as the trains themselves. It was not until his student days in the late 1950s at Harrow School of Art that he found tangible expression for the visual possibilities that railways offered him. Though he was more interested in illustration than in photography, he began taking photographs of railway scenes around North London and especially along the Great Central Main Line that passed through Harrow, gradually moving further afield. Although Bill Brandt is often cited as a major influence, the style that made Gifford's name owed much to the work of a little-known Swiss avant-garde railway photographer Jean-Michel Hartmann, whose book Magie du rail (Editions Amart, 1959) () revealed an eye for pattern and form that had an impact on Gifford's pictorial approach. 1960s In the early 1960s Gifford joined Ian Allan Publishing as art editor and occasionally placed railway photographs in the magazines he designed. He took many of his well-known shots – including images of Bulleid pacifics at speed, captured from trains on adjacent lines – during his daily commute. Thirty years later, one of these images was featured on a Royal Mail stamp. At the publishing house, he redesigned the Combined Volume, Railway World and helped to transform Trains Illustrated into Modern Railways, a large-format monthly for transport professionals. He also designed some trompe l'oeil covers for Model Railway Constructor, including a speeding Trix 'Warship' and a 00 gauge BR Standard Class 9F seemingly emitting an enormous plume of smoke. Aside from his work at Ian Allan, Gifford continued to build a photographic record of every region of British Railways using a Rolleiflex medium-format twin-lens reflex camera. He also photographed the full length of the River Thames with the idea of one day making a book out of it. His work was predominantly in black and white. For 35 mm colour work he used cheaper, less sophisticated cameras such as the Russian-made Fed; in later years a Pentax SLR. In 1965 the Decline of Steam book was published. In place of front three-quarter views (with the sun always coming over the photographer's shoulder and the locomotive number clearly visible), Decline of Steam portrayed misty industrial landscapes, sweating railway workers, rain-swept nocturnal platforms, and sulphurous engine sheds. The trains themselves were often almost an afterthought in this vision of the railway as a totality; some images did not feature trains at all. By 1967, Gifford had left his job to focus on photographing the final years of British steam His work from this time influenced the British photographers John Tickner, Gordon Edgar, and Adrian Freeman in their work on steam trains in China. Each a Glimpse Each a Glimpse, his second book, which he also designed, was published by Ian Allan in 1970. Many of the pictures dated from 1967 to 1968 and the influence of Jean-Michel Hartmann – which was strong in Decline of Steam – was less marked in a book that showed how, in those final years of steam, Gifford had begun to experiment with new techniques and find his own visual language, less graphically dynamic and more pictorialist than before. And Gone Forever Although he had amassed a collection of some 18,000 negatives between 1958 and 1968, with enough unpublished material (including his rarely glimpsed colour work) for many more books, Gifford's fastidiousness about his work became something of a stumbling block. The Thames book failed to find a publisher, while sales of Steam Railways in Industry (Batsford, 1976) were disappointing, as was the reproduction quality. Meanwhile, a projected seven-part region-by- region study with Ian Allan ceased after the first volume, Steam Finale North (1976), had been published. Gifford was not pleased when Ian Allan subsequently published Steam Finale Scotland, which was superficially a continuation of the series but in fact contained nothing by Gifford. Things had looked more promising when, the previous year, Gifford had signed with New English Library to produce the companion-piece to Each a Glimpse, entitled And Gone Forever. With an eye on the export market and foreign co-editions, extensive use of colour was stipulated for the first time. A mock-up of And Gone Forever was presented at the 1976 Frankfurt Book Fair but the book never reached production, at least in the form Gifford and his publisher anticipated. Deadlines came and went and though most of the design work was eventually completed, the contract was terminated in 1978. A very different book of the same title finally appeared from Oxford Publishing Company in 1994, but without the colour photographs that had been promised 18 years earlier. Commemorative stamps for the Royal Mail Also in 1994, the Royal Mail published a set of five postage stamps featuring a selection of his photographs, chosen in collaboration with the designer Brian Delaney; as with all Royal Mail stamp issues, the designs were personally approved by the Queen. The stamps commemorate the sesquicentennial of a number of British train lines. There was an exhibition at the National Postal Museum (British Postal Museum) to mark the event, which included items such as Gifford's notebooks and treasured Rolleiflex camera. 2000s By the late 2000s there was talk of a new, revised edition of Each a Glimpse with enhanced, digitally scanned images taken from the original negatives and a significant number of minor alterations to the layout. The book was published in 2012, and a slipcased limited edition was also offered at a premium price. Gifford's introduction to the revised edition of Each a Glimpse alludes to a set of approximately 100 colour images that had been exhibited at Kidderminster Railway Museum in 2009 under the title In the Wink of an Eye. The book Transition was published in August 2018 to mark the 50th anniversary of the last steam workings on British Rail. Kidderminster Railway Museum was to be the publisher and the images would feature diesel and electric traction as well as steam. Gifford had been one of few photographers who, in the fast- changing railway scene of the 1960s, responded creatively to the new forms of traction, often depicting them side by side with steam power. Gifford was present in person at the opening of an exhibition of photographs from the book – held at Kidderminster Railway Museum on 4 August 2018 – but of the finished copies there was no sign whatsoever. Rather than the more costly gravure method generally used for high-quality monochrome work, the KLM's printer had been instructed to use a simple four-colour process which, while less expensive, is not primarily designed for black and white. The book finally went on sale in May 2019, after long-standing production difficulties.

In 1925 Superga invented the 2750 model, shoes with vulcanized rubber soles. From 1934, the firm diversified its production to new collections dedicated to other sports and daily life. After World War II, Superga restarted production specializing solely in high quality footwear. In 1951 the firm merged with Pirelli, which brought it new funds and made it possible to sharply increase the production of tennis shoes. In the 1970s, as the sales of the 2750 continued, Superga diversified to add sport shoes with technical attributes. In the 1980s, the firm launched the production of clothes. The original white Superga model Superga UK employs popular celebrities as their brand ambassadors, with whom they collaborate to create a collection of shoes designed by the ambassador each year, including Alexa Chung in 2012, Rita Ora in 2013, and Suki Waterhouse in 2014.

Barceló amassed a small fortune by capitalizing on the flow of American and Mexican traders involved with the nineteenth-century Santa Fe Trail. She became infamous in the U.S. as the Mexican \\"Queen of Sin\\" through a series of American travel writings and newspaper serials before, during, and after the war. These depictions, often intended to explain or justify the U.S. invasion of Mexico, presented La Tules as a madame and prostitute who symbolized the supposedly immoral nature of the local Mexican population. Early life Barceló may have been born in the state of Sonora, Mexico around 1800 but one correspondent of the time, Wilkins Kendall of the New Orleans Picayune, argued in his book Narrative of the Texas—Santa Fe Expedition that she was French, referring to her as Madame Toulouse. Not much is known about her early life or her family. Shortly after Mexico won its independence from Spain in 1821, Barceló, her parents, a brother, and two sisters moved to the remote northern territory of New Mexico. On June 23, 1823 Barceló married Manuel Sisneros at the Church of Tome. The priest who performed the ceremony referred to her as \\"Doña,\\" a title given to women of quality and high social standing. Much attention would later be given to the fact that she was four years older than her groom and four or five months pregnant at the time. The couple had two sons, both of whom died as infants.Alter, Judy. Extraordinary Women of the American West. Children's Press, 1999, p. 18-20 Fiercely independent, Barceló retained all of her own property throughout her marriage and was known by her maiden name. Early Gambling Career In 1825, Mexican authorities fined Barceló for operating a gambling salon for miners in the Ortiz Mountains. Sometime over the next ten years, Barceló relocated to Santa Fe and opened a more ambitious saloon at the center of Santa Fe, New Mexico. She went by the nickname \\"Tules,\\" a Spanish diminutive of \\"Gertrudis.\\" Some authors have connected this to the Mexican Spanish word tules, meaning \\"reeds,\\" with suggestions that it referred to \\"the curvaceousness of her figure\\" or possibly to \\"her thin frame.\\" Contact with Euro-Americans Because of its centrality in Santa Fe, Barceló's saloon entertained many Americans traveling the Santa Fe Trail. Susan Magoffin, grand-daughter of Kentucky's first governor and the bride of an American trader, was perhaps Barceló's greatest critic. She wrote the La Tules \\"made her living by running a house where open gambling, drinking, and smoking were enjoyed by all...with no thought of being socially degraded.\\" Some drank her liquor and gambled at her tables, but later reviled \\"Doña Tules\\" in writings sent to the Eastern U.S. Typical of many, Josiah Gregg's widely read Commerce of the Prairies described Tules as a woman of \\"loose habits.\\".\\" In addition to erroneous assertions that she was a prostitute, many also claimed that she was having an illicit affair with Manuel Armijo, the Governor of New Mexico. These sensational accounts were often embellished, if not totally fabricated. Most of the American descriptions of Tules Barceló contradicted each other. Some claimed she was astoundingly beautiful, while others wrote of her as old and toothless. Some said she had coal-black hair, while others said she had a shock of red hair. Some mistakenly claimed that she had been born in Taos, New Mexico rather than Sonora. The only real agreement among them was that Tules excelled at the card game monte, often winning vast piles of gold from the male customers in her saloon. Barceló probably did not know about her infamy in English-language publications. She carefully guarded her good name in Santa Fe. On two occasions in the 1830s, Barceló went to court to defend herself against slanderous comments from her Mexican neighbors. Despite her negative reputation among Americans and the alleged source of her \\"ill-gotten\\" fortune, the U.S. Army borrowed funds from Barceló shortly after the invasion of New Mexico in 1846. This loan paid the invading troops, making the continued occupation of Santa Fe possible. She's also been credited with exposing a conspiracy against the Army and thereby preventing a massacre. Under the terms of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Barceló, like the other Mexican citizens in the territory, automatically became a U.S. citizen in 1849 by simply having waited a year after the treaty's signing. Death Barceló died on January 17, 1852 in Santa Fe with a remarkable fortune of $10,000 and several houses. Her will and a deed dictated to a local magistrate are the only documents known to have been written by her. She left her residence and property to her brother, her sister, and two young girls who had lived with her. All of Santa Fe attended her elaborate funeral, which was criticized by some for being too fancy for a woman like her, and for being financed by \\"ill-gotten gain.\\" Legacy Novelists, historians, and even performers have been drawn to Barceló's legend. Far from being historically accurate, most of the representations of her since 1852 have been influenced by ahistorical or racist assumptions. Anna Burr presented Tules as a manipulative trickster in the 1936 novel, The Golden Quicksand. In 1948, Ruth Laughlin wrote the novel The Wind Leaves No Shadow with Barceló as the protagonist. While Laughlin clearly intended to be sympathetic to Barceló, racist assumptions nonetheless guided the novel's content. Except Barceló, the Mexicans in Laughlin's novel conform to stereotypes as jealous, superstitious, lustful, or even as outright murderers. The actress Katy Jurado appeared as Dona Tules in the 1962 episode \\"La Tules\\" of the syndicated television anthology series, Death Valley Days, hosted by Stanley Andrews. The life of Dona Tules has also been told in the musical Viva Santa Fe!, written by James Stewart, The musical was first presented in Hobbs, New Mexico in 1991, then represented the state of New Mexico at the 1992 World's Fair in Seville, Spain. The musical was the featured entertainment at the Music Teacher's National Convention, in Albuquerque in 1995. The concert performance begins Fall of 2019 in Las Vegas, New Mexico.

In Tahitian mythology, Oviri was the goddess of mourning and is shown with long pale hair and wild eyes, smothering a wolf with her feet while clutching a cub in her arms. Art historians have presented multiple interpretations—usually that Gauguin intended it as an epithet to reinforce his self-image as a \\"civilised savage\\". Tahitian goddesses of her era had passed from folk memory by 1894, yet Gauguin romanticises the island's past as he reaches towards more ancient sources, including an Assyrian relief of a \\"master of animals\\" type, and Majapahit mummies. Other possible influences include preserved skulls from the Marquesas Islands, figures found at Borobudur, and a 9th-century Mahayana Buddhist temple in central Java. Gauguin made three casts, each in partially glazed stoneware, and while several copies exist in plaster or bronze, the original cast is in the Musée d'Orsay. His sales of the casts were not successful, and at a low financial and personal ebb he asked for one to be placed on his grave. There are only three other surviving comments of his on the figure: he described the figure as a strange and cruel enigma on an 1895 presentation mount of two impressions of a woodcut of Oviri for Stéphane Mallarmé; he referred to it as La Tueuse (\\"The Murderess\\") in an 1897 letter to Ambroise Vollard; and he appended an inscription referencing Honoré de Balzac's novel Séraphîta in a drawing.Landy, 242, 244–46 Oviri was exhibited at the 1906 Salon d'Automne (no. 57)\\"1906 Salon d'automne\\".

They had been introduced by Félix BracquemondCampbell, 224 who, inspired by the new French art pottery, was experimenting with the form. During that winter of 1886–87, Gauguin visited Chaplet's workshop at Vaugirard, where they collaborated on stoneware pots with applied figures or ornamental fragments and multiple handles.\\"French Art Pottery\\".

Gauguin's response centred on Oviri: > I believe that my large statue in ceramic, the Tueuse (\\"The Murderess\\"), is > an exceptional piece such as no ceramist has made until now and that, in > addition, it would look very well cast in bronze (without retouching and > without patina).

Christie's, Impressionist and Modern Art (Day Sale), 9 November 2000. Retrieved 21 February 2015 It is not clear whether Oviri is smothering or hugging the cub, but her pose invokes ideas of sacrifice, infanticide and the archetype of the vengeful mother, influenced by Eugène Delacroix's 1838 painting, Medea About to Kill Her Children. A second animal, likely another wolf, is at her feet either curling in submission or dead.Taylor, 198–99 Art historians including Sue Taylor suggest the second animal may represent Gauguin.Taylor, 199 The association between the woman and a wolf stems from a remark Edgar Degas made defending Gauguin's work at the poorly received 1893 Durand-Ruel exhibition, when Degas quoted La Fontaine's fable The Dog and the Wolf, which is usually taken as implying that freedom should not be exchanged for comfort or financial gain: \\"You see, Gauguin is the wolf.\\"Brooks, 95 In Oviri, the mature wolf, the European Gauguin, perishes while the whelp, the Gauguin of Tahiti, survives.Taylor, 206 Siddharta Gautama, 8th century frieze, Borobudur The Tahitian myths had largely disappeared by Gauguin's time (he based his own accounts on other sources without acknowledgement), as had most artefacts associated with that culture. His representation of Oviri is largely a work of imagination, informed by a collection of what he described as his \\"little world of friends\\" and which he took with him to Tahiti on his first visit. These included Odilon Redon's lithograph La Mort, photographs of subjects such as a temple frieze at Borobudur, Java, and an Egyptian fresco from an 18th dynasty tomb at Thebes.Thomson, 143, 145, 152 Other sources that have been suggested include an Assyrian relief of Gilgamesh clutching a lion cub now in the Louvre, and a Majapahit terracotta figure from the Djakarta museum.Taylor, 197 Oviri's head seems based on mummified skulls of chieftains in the Marquesas Islands, whose eye sockets were traditionally encrusted with mother- of-pearl and worshiped as divine. Elements of her body may draw from Borobudur images of fecundity. Thus life and death were evoked in the same image.Gray, 65 In a letter to Mallarmé trying to raise a public subscription to purchase the work, Morice titled the sculpture Diane Chasseresse (\\"Diana the Huntress\\"), an allusion to the ancient Greek goddess Diana of the hunt, moon and childbirth. He made the same reference in his poems on Oviri. Barbara Landy interprets the life and death theme as indicating Gauguin's need to abandon his civilised ego in a return to the natural state of the primitive savage.Landy, 245–46 The work is related to the 1889 ceramic Black Venus, which shows a woman kneeling over a severed head resembling the artist.\\"The Eternal Feminine\\". Tate. Retrieved 23 August 2015 Nancy Mowll Mathews believes the creatures in her arms and at her feet are actually foxes, animals Gauguin had used in his 1889 wood carving Be in Love, You Will Be Happy and in his 1891 Pont-Aven oil painting The Loss of Virginity. In an 1889 letter to Émile Bernard, he described the Soyez amoureuses fox as an \\"Indian symbol of perversity\\".Barkan; Bush, 258 There is a long tradition in Asian folklore of foxes having the power to transform into women (for example in Japanese Yōkai or Kitsune folklore).Casal, 1–93 Gauguin depicts the Oviri figure in at least one drawing, two watercolour transfer monotypes and two woodcuts. It is possible that the woodcuts were created in Pont-Aven in the summer of 1894; before the ceramic.Brettell, 375–76 The last to appear is probably the drawing in what is apparently the first issue of Gauguin's Papeete broadsheet Le Sourire \\"(The Smile: A Serious Newspaper)\\" published between August 1899 and April 1900. It was accompanied by the inscription \\"Et le monstre, entraînant sa créature, féconde de sa semence des flancs généreux pour engendrer Séraphitus-Séraphita\\" (And the monster, embracing its creation, filled her generous womb with seed and fathered Séraphitus-Séraphita). Séraphitus- Séraphita is an allusion to Honoré de Balzac's novel Séraphîta which features an androgynous hero. In this first issue of Le Sourire, he reviewed a local Maohi author's play by that dealt with incest (among other themes), and invokes 'Séraphitus-Séraphita'. The review congratulated the play's \\"savage author\\" and ended with a plea for women's liberation through the abolition of marriage. The accompanying drawing is distinctly androgynous.Taylor, 215–18 File:Hero lion Dur-Sharrukin Louvre AO19862.jpgRelief from a façade in the throne room of Sargon II (Khorsabad, 713–706 BC), showing an Assyrian hero grasping a lion and a snake, Louvre File:Paul Gauguin, 1889, Pot Anthropomorphe, glazed stoneware, 28.4 cm, Musée d'Orsay, Paris.jpgPot Anthropomorphe, 1889, glazed stoneware, Musée d'Orsay File:Paul Gauguin, 1893-95, Objet décoratif carré avec dieux tahitiens, terre cuite, rehauts peints, 34 cm, Musée d'Orsay, Paris.jpgPaul Gauguin, 1893–95, Objet décoratif carré avec dieux tahitiens, terracotta, Musée d'Orsay File:Paul Gauguin - Oviri - Watercolor monotype F 31.jpgOviri, 1894, watercolour monotype, Fogg Museum, Boston Interpretation Art historians have put forward various theories as to the seeming multiplicity of meanings inherent in Gauguin's representation. Most obviously the figure invokes Tahitian legend and themes of death and superstition. It reflects the artist's view of female sexuality; a common motif in 19th century art was the connection between long, wild hair and evil femininity. Related is the delight Gauguin took from its alternative title \\"savage\\" and the implications of a brutal, bloodthirsty deity, which seems to refer as much to himself as the goddess.Gray, 245 Tahiti deity Gauguin's figure invokes the Polynesian goddess Hina, depicted by Morice as a Diana-like deity clutching a wolf cub, \\"monstrous and majestic, drunk with pride, rage and sorrow\\".Taylor, 211, 214 He titled an 1894 self-portrait in plaster as Oviri. The original is lost but a number of bronze casts survive. He used double mirrors to capture his familiar Inca profile, the result reprising his Jug in the Form of a Head, Self-Portrait. This was one of the earliest occasions Gauguin applied the term Oviri to himself.Cachin, 377\\"Sale 3022 Lot 49\\". Christie's. Retrieved 21 March 2015\\"Auction 932 Lot 130\\". Lempertz.

Oviri was the title of a favourite Tahitian song—a melancholy tune of love and longing that mentions the subject's \\"savage, restless heart\\". It recounts the love between two women for each other, both of whom have grown silent and cold. Gauguin translated the verse in his series of romanticised journal Noa Noa (Tahitian for \\"fragrance\\", a written project he undertook to examine his Tahitian experience, which he accompanied with a series of ten woodcuts);Ives, 103Paul Gauguin, Charles Morice, Noa Noa (full text online) the only one of his songs reprinted in the Tahitian newspaper La Guêpes when he became editor. Danielsson believes the song echoes Gauguin's dual attachment to his Danish wife Mette and his then vahine (Tahitian for \\"woman\\") Teha'amana, his young native wife and the focal point of Noa Noa.Danielsson, 115–17 Rave te iti aamu (The Idol), 1898. Hermitage Museum Noa Noa contains an account of a journey into the mountains with a young man whom he eventually understands as sexless, leading him to meditate on the \\"androgynous side of the savage\\" in his manuscript.Frèches-Thory, 371–72Solomon-Godeau, 321Eisenman, 113–19 Ben Pollitt notes that in Tahitian culture the craftsman/artist, neither warrior/hunter nor homemaker/carer, was conceived androgynously, an ambiguous gender position that appealed to Gauguin's subversive nature.Pollitt, Ben. \\"Gauguin, Oviri. Khan Academy, 2015. Retrieved 23 August 2015 Taylor believes Morice may have been describing Gauguin in his 1897 poem Shining Hina of the Woods as part of two long extracts from their collaboration on Noa Noa. Gray views the sculpture as representing \\"the expression of Gauguin's profound disillusionment and discouragement\\". Noa Noa is part of Gauguin's documentation of his experiences as a colonial visitor to Tahiti in 1891–1893. He first used the term \\"Noa Noa\\" to describe the scent of Tahitian women: \\"A mingled perfume, half animal, half vegetable emanated from them; the perfume of their blood and of the gardenia taitensis, which they wore in their hair\\".Nicole, 126 On his return to Paris in 1893, Gauguin was apprehensive about exhibiting his Tahitian works. Noa Noa was to provide the context necessary for the public to comprehend the new motifs presented at his Durand-Ruel exhibition. It was not completed in time for the opening of the exhibition.\\"Paul Gauguin's Noa Noa\\". The Cleveland Museum of Art. Retrieved 11 October 2015 Self portrait Gauguin asked that Oviri be placed on his grave, which seems to indicate that he saw the figure as his alter ego. According to Mathews, he saw the fox as changeable in its gender as he was, and thus symbolic of dangerous sexuality.Mathews, 208 A number of sources indicate that Gauguin was suffering a syphilitic rash that prevented him from travelling to Tahiti for several months. She suggests the orifice is a pars pro toto for the woman who infected him. The anthropologist believes Oviri was intended as an epithet to reinforce Gauguin's persona as a \\"civilised savage\\".van der Grijp, 126Gedo, 61 In his final letter to Morice, the artist wrote that \\"You were wrong that day when you said I was wrong to say I was a savage. It's true enough: I am a savage. And civilised people sense the fact. In my work there is nothing that can surprise or disconcert, except the fact that I am a savage in spite of myself. That's also why my work is inimitable.\\"Frèches-Thory, 371Browning Chipp, 84 Reception and influence Oviri presentation mount for Stéphane Mallarmé, 1895. Art Institute of Chicago Whether or not the sculpture was to be exhibited at the Salon de la Nationale, it was scheduled for the café proprietor Lévy at 57 rue Saint-Lazare, with whom Gauguin had concluded an agreement to represent him before his last departure for Tahiti. It failed to sell, and Charles Morice was unable to raise public money to acquire it for the nation. Gauguin had thought his only likely interested patron would be Gustave Fayet, who did eventually buy it for 1,500 francs, but in 1905, after Gauguin's death.Schackelford, 138 Gauguin was celebrated by the Parisian avant-garde after the posthumous retrospective exhibitions at the Salon d'Automne in 1903 and 1906. The power evoked by his work led directly to Les Demoiselles d'Avignon in 1907. According to David Sweetman, Picasso became an aficionado of Gauguin in 1902 when he befriended the expatriate Spanish sculptor and ceramist Paco Durrio in Paris. Durrio was a friend of Gauguin and held several of his works in an attempt to help his poverty-stricken friend in Tahiti by promoting his oeuvre in Paris.Sweetman, 562–63 Art historian John Richardson writes: > The 1906 exhibition of Gauguin's work left Picasso more than ever in this > artist's thrall. Gauguin demonstrated the most disparate types of art—not to > speak of elements from metaphysics, ethnology, symbolism, the Bible, > classical myths, and much else besides—could be combined into a synthesis > that was of its time yet timeless. An artist could also confound > conventional notions of beauty, he demonstrated, by harnessing his demons to > the dark gods (not necessarily Tahitian ones) and tapping a new source of > divine energy.Richardson, 461 Both Sweetman and Richardson point to the Gauguin Oviri as a major influence. First exhibited in the 1906 Salon d'Automne retrospective, it was probably a direct influence on Les Demoiselles. David Sweetman writes, \\"Gauguin's statue Oviri, which was prominently displayed in 1906, was to stimulate Picasso's interest in both sculpture and ceramics, while the woodcuts would reinforce his interest in printmaking, though it was the element of the primitive in all of them which most conditioned the direction that Picasso's art would take. This interest would culminate in the seminal Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.\\" In 2006, a bronze version of Oviri sold at Christie's New York for US$251,200.

He may have been a descendant of the Roman gens Cania. He is venerated on 25 May.  Life and persecution  The principal source of information on the life of Canius is the Passio San Canionis, a document preserved in Acerenza Cathedral. According to this, Canius was born in Iulia (near Carthage) in the first half of the 3rd century and later became bishop of Acerenza. During the Persecution of Diocletian he refused in the presence of the prefect Pigrasius to worship idols and to acknowledge the divinity of the Emperor. He was thereupon put to torture and then imprisoned, on the assumption that hunger and his injuries would erode his resistance. He continued nevertheless to proclaim the Gospel and with his words and long-suffering converted to Christianity all who came near him. When the prisoner's resistance was reported to him the prefect ordered him to be decapitated. A violent storm accompanied by an earthquake scattered the soldiers, and in the confusion Canius, with some of the faithful, was able to escape in a boat to Volturno. Miracles At Atella (on the site of the present hamlet of Sant'Arpino), where he preached the Gospel, many miracles were attributed to him. In the amphitheatre of Atella, a man was healed in the middle of a heart attack by the touch of Canius' hand; a blind woman named Eugenia regained her sight; and a boy was cured of demonic possession. When he was old and ill, Canius retired to a hermitage, where he died. Bishop Elpidius, when he learnt miraculously of Canius' death, built a little shrine on the site to protect the saint's body.  Veneration  In about 800 bishop Leone of Acerenza built a cathedral on the ruins of an old shrine and translated the body of Canius there from Atella. In 1080, according to the chronicler Lupo Protospata, the body of Canius was re-discovered, and the newly rebuilt cathedral and diocese were put under his protection. In 1543, on the occasion of a pastoral visit by Cardinal Saraceni it was observed that it was not possible to see the body of Saint Canius, because it was under a large altar. In the ambulatory of the present Acerenza Cathedral beneath the altar of Saint Canius his crozier is still preserved, a relic which is displayed and venerated, and considered as a testimony to the Diocese of Acerenza's calling to the mission of evangelisation. Saint Canius is also venerated in the parish that bears his name, San Canione in Sant'Arpino, in the province of Caserta, where an ancient structure, now known as the Romitorio di San Canione, is dedicated to him.

Remembered as both a main participant in the imposition of Socialist Realism in its Romanian form and a patron of dissenting modernist and postmodern literature, he began his career in politics during World War II, when he sided with the anti-fascist groups and the underground Romanian Communist Party in opposition to the Axis-aligned Ion Antonescu regime. During the first twenty years of Communist Romania, Georgescu assisted Leonte Răutu in exercising Stalinist control over local literature, but also published young nonconformist authors, beginning with Nichita Stănescu and Matei Călinescu, in his Gazeta Literară. Sidelined over his own incompatibility with the Socialist Realist dogma, and returning to public life during the 1960s liberalization enforced by Nicolae Ceaușescu, he became openly adverse to Ceaușescu's variety of national communism and clandestinely cultivated the prohibited ideology of Trotskyism. During the final part of his life, Paul Georgescu became especially known as an experimental novelist, among the first postmodernists on the local scene, and, although physically impaired, one of the most prolific Romanian authors of the late 20th century. His main works of the time, including the critically acclaimed Vara baroc (\\"Baroque in Summer\\"), deal with urban and suburban life on the Bărăgan Plain, creatively parodying the work of 19th and early 20th century writers. While admired for his contribution to fiction and his lifelong promotion of anti-dogmatic literature, Georgescu remains controversial for his political affiliations and his early participation in censorship. Biography Early life and World War II Georgescu was born in Țăndărei, a commune on the Bărăgan (presently included in Ialomiţa County). Both his parents were middle-class ethnic Romanians, Radu Cosaşu, \\"Paulgeorgescianul 'Mda' \\", in Dilema Veche, Vol. II, Nr. 94, November 2005 his father having set up practice as a physician.Horia Gârbea, Trecute vieţi de fanţi şi de birlici, Cartea Românească, Bucharest, 2008, p.94. From early on, he was alarmed by the rise of fascist groups, primarily the Iron Guard, adopting a Marxist perspective in reaction.Manea, p.206-207 Involved in anti- fascist circles during World War II, the future writer is believed to have joined the then-illegal Romanian Communist Party (PCR) as an adolescent, and reportedly fought against the Nazi-supported Ion Antonescu regime (see Romania during World War II).Manea, p.202, 206 Iulia Arsintescu, \\"Un scriitor uitat (?) şi o faptă bună (!)\\", at Editura LiterNet, May 15, 2003; retrieved February 18, 2009 Dan C. Mihăilescu, \\"Descumpănit şi fără plăcere\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 295, November 2005 Although affiliated with a party which followed a Stalinist and pro-Soviet line, the young activist may have been appreciative of Trotskyism, and this sympathy is known to have surfaced in his later years. Ştefan Agopian, \\"La România Literară (XIV)\\", in Academia Caţavencu, July 22, 2009Călinescu & Vianu, p.150; Manea, p.210 Georgescu was a political prisoner of the Antonescu regime, said to have been because he had given shelter to a Soviet spy. He was, according to legend, sentenced to death by the authorities before turning nineteen, but managed to evade execution.Manea, p.202 His later friend and fellow author Radu Cosaşu writes that \\"[Paul Georgescu] had been in danger of a court-martial\\". During the early stages of Soviet occupation, and before the official establishment of Communist Romania, Paul Georgescu took an active part in communization at a cultural level in general, and the establishment of a local Socialist Realist trend in particular. Researcher Ana Selejan thus lists him in the \\"first generation of creators, tailors and propagandists of the new literary order.\\"Selajan, p.154. Selejan's list also includes Maria Banuş, Aurel Baranga, Radu Boureanu, Marcel Breslaşu, Dan Deşliu, Geo Dumitrescu, Miron- Radu Paraschivescu, Traian Şelmaru, Cicerone Theodorescu and Ion Vitner. Political preeminence In the 1950s, Georgescu became an activist of the PCR Central Committee's Agitprop section, an office which reportedly led literary circles to perceive him as the éminence grise of chief ideologues Leonte Răutu and Iosif Chişinevschi. Valeriu Râpeanu, \\"Cea dintâi zi la Capşa\\", in Magazin Istoric, June 2001 Valeriu Râpeanu, \\"Ce roman, viaţa lui Zaharia Stancu\\", in Magazin Istoric, September 1998 After a restructuring of the education system, he also advanced hierarchically to the position of lecturer at the University of Bucharest Faculty of Letters. A member of the newly created Writers' Union of Romania, Georgescu was first elected to the head bureau of its Prose Section in October 1952.Selejan, p.148-149, 353 He was also rapporteur at the 1956 Writers' Union Congress, during which the Communist Party, using Stalinist rhetoric, condemned the cultural aspects of De-Stalinization as \\"formalism\\" and \\"vulgar sociologism\\".F. Mihăilescu, p.96-112 His texts, offering endorsement to the Romanian Socialist Realist current, were published as Încercări critice (\\"Critical Essays\\", 1957 and 1958). In March 1954, he was co-founder of Gazeta Literară, inaugurated as a Romanian equivalent to the Soviet Union's Literaturnaya Gazeta.Dimisianu & Elvin, p.94 The new publication was initially led by aging writer Zaharia Stancu, whose disagreements with the PCR leadership made the latter withdraw him from public life and assign him the honorary position of magazine director. Georgescu, who took over for Stancu as editor, published articles in the other venues of the Socialist Realist press: Contemporanul, Viaţa Românească and the PCR platform Scînteia. With Ovid Crohmălniceanu, Sergiu Fărcăşan and Petru Dumitriu, he contributed the sporadic literary chronicles at Scînteia (beginning 1953).Selejan, p.193-194 Paul Georgescu assumed a first-hand position in directing and promoting a young generation of writers during 1952, when he became one of the main lecturers at the newly founded School of Literature, a Writers' Union venture.Vasile, p.278-279 In 1954, Georgescu hired Valeriu Râpeanu, at the time a student and later known for his scholarly works on 19th century poet Mihai Eminescu, to a position at Gazeta Literară. Among the other essayists specialized in literary criticism who were promoted by Georgescu as head of the magazine were Gabriel Dimisianu, Ştefan Cazimir and Nicolae Velea (the latter of whom he also encouraged to become a short story writer).Dimisianu & Elvin, p.93 By 1957, he was also in touch with Matei Călinescu, future critic and novelist, whom he first employed as Gazeta Literară proofreader.Călinescu & Vianu, p.146-147 At that stage, Călinescu recalls, Georgescu developed a fondness for both him the young modernist poet Nichita Stănescu, as well as with their literary friends Cezar Baltag, Nicolae Breban, Grigore Hagiu, Modest Morariu and Petre Stoica.Călinescu & Vianu, p.149 Although the group soon after migrated toward Anatol E. Baconsky's Cluj- based rival magazine Steaua,Călinescu & Vianu, p.314 Georgescu is occasionally credited with having launched Stănescu by welcoming him among the prominent poets of his day.Călinescu & Vianu, p.149, 306; Dimisianu & Elvin, p.91, 93; Manea, p.215 Gabriela Adameşteanu, \\"Nu există cultură formată numai din genii\\" (interview with Ştefan Agopian), in Revista 22, Nr. 803, July 2005 Ovidiu Şimonca, \\" 'A fost o mare bucurie a mea să descopăr şi să inventez lumi'. Interviu cu Ştefan Agopian\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 310, March 2006 He is believed to have had a similar role in the careers of Matei CălinescuCălinescu & Vianu, p.336, 338; Dimisianu & Elvin, p.93-94 and Călinescu's Gazeta Literară companions,Călinescu & Vianu, p.306; Dimisianu & Elvin, p.91, 93-94 as well as in those of Ştefan Bănulescu and Marin Preda. Conflicts with other sections of the Socialist Realist cultural establishment surfaced in the 1950s, when the tolerance of modernism by Gazeta Literară was officially condemned as \\"escapism\\" by Crohmălniceanu.Călinescu & Vianu, p.336-337 In 1957, he further upset communist decision-makers by agreeing to publish article Incomparabilul (\\"The Incomparable One\\") by Constantin Ţoiu, which lampooned his fellow Socialist Realist author Dumitriu. Ioana Macrea-Toma, \\"Constantin Ţoiu şi poetica amintirilor\\" , in Apostrof, Nr. 10/2005, republished by the Romanian Cultural Institute's România Culturală Eventually, ideological disagreements with the communist apparatus made his colleagues subject him to a censure vote, and Georgescu was removed from his position at Gazeta Literară. Călinescu, who records both his disgruntlement and the definition he gave to his new condition: scriitor la domiciliu (\\"writer in residence\\"). His editorial office at Gazeta Literară was assigned to Aurel Mihale, himself succeeded by Tiberiu Utan.Dimisianu & Elvin, p.95 1960s transition With the rise to power of Nicolae Ceauşescu and the onset of relative liberalization, Romanian Socialist Realism came to an end. During that stage, although hostile to the new leadership, Georgescu adapted to the requirements, a change exemplified by his 1967 collection of essays, Polivalenţa necesară (\\"The Necessary Plurality\\"), and by his 1968 novel Coborînd (\\"Descending\\"). In parallel, he published two collections of short stories: Vîrstele tinereţii (\\"The Ages of Youth\\", 1967) and 3 nuvele (\\"3 Novellas\\", 1973), the latter of which featured his acclaimed story Pilaf (named after the Oriental dish). Bedros Horasangian, \\"Pilaf\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 90, November 2001 Gazeta Literară was itself a victim of the liberalization climate, and, in 1968, was closed down to be replaced with România Literară, edited by Geo Dumitrescu. Georgescu continued to play an important part in launching the careers of young writers. Beginning 1969, he helped novelist Norman Manea establish himself on the local scene.Manea, p.208-210, 216-217 Between 1976 and 1986, Georgescu was in correspondence with Ion Simuţ, an aspiring critic whom the educational system of the day had assigned to a schoolteacher's position in the remote commune of Ţeţchea, Bihor County.Daniel Cristea-Enache, \\"Paul Georgescu - Ion Simuţ. Manualul criticului literar\\", in Concert de deschidere, Editura LiterNet, 2004. (available online at the LiterNet site) He helped Simuţ publish his contributions in Bucharest journals, personally intervening with editors. He was in the meantime engaged in a rivalry with some main figures of the neorealist tendency, who were traditionally closer to the Ceauşescu regime: Preda, Eugen Barbu, Petru Dumitriu and Titus Popovici. During that time, he ended his collaboration with Scînteia and began contributing to România Liberă daily, which, under Octavian Paler's direction, took a certain distance from the official line.Manea, p.210, 216-217 According to Manea, Georgescu's contributions to România Literară, which also hosted writers diverging from the PCR-imposed course, were \\"never refused\\".Manea, p.216 He also published two other novels: Înainte de tăcere (\\"Before the Silence\\", 1975) and Doctorul Poenaru (\\"Doctor Poenaru\\", 1976), followed in 1977 by Revelion (titled after the common word for a New Year's Eve party). Ion Simuţ, \\"Vipie, zăpuşeală şi zăduf\\", in România Literară, Nr. 29/2007 Final years By the late 1970s, Georgescu had entered his most fecund stage as a prose writer, regularly publishing his novels at one-year intervals. At the same time, his life and career were being changed by disease.Manea, p.202-203 He had a malformation of the vertebral column and was already walking with a limp; in old age, his limbs were affected by ankylosis, which greatly reduced his mobility, and he developed a tendency for obesity.Manea, p.202-203, 209-210, 214-215 According to his friend Manea, \\"the assault of diseases and age\\", coupled with resentment from Ceauşescu's \\"functionaries of the Dogma\\", had physically isolated Georgescu from his peers. The acclaimed novels Vara baroc and Solstiţiu tulburat (\\"Troubled Solstice\\") saw print in 1980 and 1982 respectively. The former earned him the Writers' Union Prize for Prose in 1981, a ceremony which, due to his declining health, he could not attend in person.Manea, p.201-202 Vîrstele raţiunii (\\"The Ages of Reason\\"), a book of interviews Paul Georgescu granted to poet Florin Mugur, was also published in 1982.Manea, p.204 At that time, Georgescu was cultivating some apolitical or anti-communist authors of modernist or avant-garde literature, preferring them over the revival of nationalist and traditionalist literature in Ceauşescu's Romania. He became interested in the works of a new subversive and lyrical generation of writers, collectively known as Optzecişti, playing a special part in the promotion of their representatives Ştefan Agopian and Mircea Cărtărescu.Dimisianu & Elvin, p.93; Manea, p.215 Radu Cosaşu, \\"Candoare şi viclenie sub tiranie\\", in Dilema Veche, Vol. II, Nr. 82, August 2005 Agopian credits the review of his 1981 novel Tache de catifea (\\"Tache de Velvet\\"), published by Georgescu in România Literară, with having established his reputation on the literary scene. Georgescu also took a sympathetic view of Târgovişte School authors such as Radu Petrescu and Mircea Horia Simionescu,Manea, p.215 of poet Mircea Ciobanu, of independent literary critic Dan C. Mihăilescu, and of modernist novelist Virgil Duda.Dimisianu & Elvin, p.93; Manea, p.88, 201, 215 In 1984, Georgescu finished the first of his novels having for a common setting Huzurei (a joking allusion to his native Țăndărei, stemming from huzur, or \\"wanton\\"). Titled Mai mult ca perfectul—lit. \\"The More than Perfect\\", after a term most commonly used for the pluperfect in Romanian grammar—, it was followed two years later by Natura lucrurilor (\\"The Nature of Things\\"), in 1987 by Pontice (\\"The Pontics\\"), and in 1988 by Geamlîc (\\"Glass Partition\\"). Ioan Holban, \\"Țăndărei\\", in România Literară, Nr. 7/2008 Paul Georgescu died in October 1989, some two months before the Romanian Revolution toppled communism. He was buried on the outskirts of Bucharest, at the cemetery in Străuleşti. According to writer Bedros Horasangian, the funeral ceremony was interrupted in the hope that more people would turn up. Columnist and literary historian Nicolae Manolescu signed Georgescu's obituary in România Literară, voicing a call for moderation in assessing his colleague's career.Mircea A. Diaconu, \\"Spiritul critic în 1989 - Începînd cu sfîrşitul\\", in Idei în Dialog, Nr. 9(48), September 2008 A final volume of the Huzurei series, titled Între timp (\\"Meanwhile\\"), was published posthumously in 1990. Literary criticism and ideological contributions Early militancy Paul Georgescu's literary career, begun shortly after World War II and during the early stages of communization, was marked by the ideological debates of the time. Matei Călinescu judges his older colleague \\"a pretty typical intellectual for his generation, [which had been] polarized between a far right (the majority) and a far left (a small minority), united by a common hatred of democracy.\\"Călinescu & Vianu, p.150 A differing opinion is held by Norman Manea, who argues that, among the writers born in the same period, Georgescu and a few others, including the far right philosophers Mircea Eliade and Emil Cioran, stood out for compensating \\"the everyday banality and void\\", not just through literature, but also through the \\"collective explosion\\" of ideology.Manea, p.204-205 Călinescu, who recalls having once been \\"fascinated\\" by Georgescu, defines him as a \\"human puzzle\\", discussing his stance as a \\"peculiar combination of formal partisan religiosity and undissimulated cynicism\\".Călinescu & Vianu, p.148-149 These traits, he argues, made the censor an exponent of the \\"perverted form\\" and \\"deceitful fanaticism\\" he believes characterized all communist potentates, and, through extension, advocates of \\"the other secular religions [...]—fascism and national- socialism.\\"Călinescu & Vianu, p.148 In 1946, two years before the Romanian Kingdom's dissolution, the young journalist had written: \\"The critical spirit is the thermometer with which one can assess if a country's democracy is real or only verbal. The enemies of the critical spirit, and of irony, and of smiles are: stupidity, haughtiness and fascism.\\"Manea, p.206 Manea, who argues that the Soviet Union had by then also proven itself \\"a ferocious enemy of democracy and the critical spirit\\", believes Georgescu was using \\"the great ideas\\" of Humanism to entice the\\"fascination\\" of intellectuals, thus withdrawing support from the idea of liberal democracy. At the end of this process, the writer assesses, concepts such as those praised by Georgescu in his 1946 text became \\"irrelevant, if not also ridiculous, absurd, grotesque.\\"Manea, p.207 Communist censor Literary historian Florin Mihăilescu includes him among the \\"most vigilant ideological censors\\", a category also grouping Ovid Crohmălniceanu, Nicolae Moraru, Mihai Novicov, Traian Şelmaru, Ion Vitner and others.F. Mihăilescu, p.313 With them and others, Georgescu took part in campaigns to verify the commitment various writers maintained toward Socialist Realist guidelines. In one such case, occurring in 1952-1953, he joined the Scînteia editors in their campaign to silence criticism of debutant poet Eugen Frunză, condemning his own magazine Viaţa Românească and Anatol E. Baconsky's Steaua for their earlier reviews.Selejan, p.38-40, 199, 256 In early 1953, during the ideological crisis provoked by the death of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, Georgescu joined other communist activists in the cultural field in endorsing the condemnation of earlier proletkult guidelines on the basis of guidelines provided by Georgy Malenkov.Selejan, p.149, 154, 193-194, 197-199, 349 In his pieces for Viaţa Românească, Georgescu gave negative reviews to several young writers of the day: poet Nina Cassian, whom he argued was a \\"formalist\\" who had failed to rally with \\"combative poetry\\";Selejan, p.45-49, 136 Baconsky, whom, he argued, made recourse to \\"a high-flown style\\", used by the author to cover his \\"unfamiliarity with life and lack of ideas\\";Selejan, p.197 and Baconsky's colleague at Steaua, Mircea Zaciu, whose satirical works, he contended, popularized \\"unhealthy aspects\\".Selejan, p.198 Such comments, literary researcher Ana Selejan notes, contributed to Baconsky being \\"blacklisted\\" by the cultural establishment.Selejan, p.257 Cassian, who recalls that the book Georgescu reviewed was \\"my most proletkultist\\", and her attempt to recover from being marginalized by communist politicos, accuses the critic of having \\"compromised\\" her, of pursuing \\"an indication from the Party [...], coupled with his own well-known cynicism\\", and of resorting to \\"ad hominems\\". \\"Simţeam nevoia unei evadări într-o zonă în care se mai putea strecura feeria\\" (interview with Nina Cassian) at the Memoria Digital Library; retrieved February 22, 2009 According to political scientist Vladimir Tismăneanu, Georgescu stood alongside Crohmălniceanu, Baconsky, Geo Bogza, Geo Dumitrescu, Petru Dumitriu, Gheorghe Haupt, Eugen Jebeleanu, Mihail Petroveanu and Nicolae Tertulian as one of the few genuine left-wing intellectuals associated with the regime during the 1950s.Vladimir Tismăneanu, Stalinism pentru eternitate, Polirom, Iaşi, 2005, p.187. The researcher emphasizes their failure to join the pro-liberalization initiatives of Miron Constantinescu, Mihail Davidoglu, Alexandru Jar and Vitner, all of whom had called for De-Stalinization at a time when PCR general secretary Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej was refusing to enforce it. In Tismăneanu's view, the stance adopted by Georgescu and his colleagues, together with their silence during the repressive measures adopted following the Hungarian Revolution, helped Leonte Răutu and his subordinate Mihai Beniuc maintain a grip on the Writers' Union. A particularly controversial text Paul Georgescu wrote for a May 1956 issue of Gazeta Literară reaffirmed that the Communist Party had a moral duty to exercise its \\"guidance\\" (îndrumare) on literary matters.Vasile, p.58-59 At the Union Congress of 1956, Georgescu voiced the official condemnation of De-Stalinization in Romanian culture, calling attention to writers whose work, he argued, had strayed away from Socialist Realist guidelines and into \\"formalism\\", \\"idealism\\", \\"subjectivism\\", or \\"art for art's sake\\".F. Mihăilescu, p.108-109 In this context, the ideologue spoke of fellow critics who adopted \\"vulgar sociologism\\", which meant discussing the work of past authors independent of their social context.F. Mihăilescu, p.108 He called attention to supposed attempts at reviving the conservative and neoclassical tenets of the 19th century literary group Junimea through the works of its leader Titu Maiorescu, making similar claims about the legacy of post-Junimist and modernist critic Eugen Lovinescu, founder of Sburătorul review. Defining such interpretations as \\"reactionary\\" and \\"bourgeois\\", Georgescu called for a literary criticism subjected to \\"the sacred cause of our people, constructing socialism\\".F. Mihăilescu, p.109 Writing in 2002, Florin Mihăilescu reviewed the Congress report, concluding: \\"Thus, the replacement of aesthetic judgment with ideological control becomes glaring, spectacular and almost unimaginable, especially coming from a critic of unquestionable acuteness, as is Paul Georgescu.\\" According to Matei Călinescu, Paul Georgescu made special efforts to push Marxist-Leninist rhetoric and conclusions into the texts of non-communist authors he reviewed for publishing, in particular those of philosopher and critic Tudor Vianu. In his recollections, first published in 1998, Călinescu wrote: \\"In 1957-1958, [...] I could see with my own eyes how the magazine's editor in chief, Paul Georgescu, was in the printing house, adding the political clichés and the daily slogans into the galley proofs of Tudor Vianu's weekly articles.\\"Călinescu & Vianu, p.146 Călinescu focuses on one such instance, when Georgescu was reportedly so angered by a Vianu text on Renaissance humanism (lacking the obligatory mention of Marxist humanism), that he called him \\"bourgeois pig\\" and modified the piece to contain \\"five or six ritualistic expressions in the wooden tongue\\". Constantin Ţoiu also recalled that his own relationship with Georgescu cooled when the latter discovered that Ţoiu was frequenting banned author Ion Negoiţescu—this, Ţoiu claimed, explains why he was no longer given permission to publish in Gazeta Literară. Georgescu took a personal part in condemning and marginalizing Negoiţescu (who was ultimately arrested in 1961), describing him as a \\"reactionary\\" author who had failed in adopting \\"the judicious attitude\\". Ştefăniţă Regman, \\"Negoiţescu ameninţat cu evacuarea\\" , in România Literară, Nr. 6/2008 For comparison, Matei Călinescu also cites the case of academic Şerban Cioculescu, who was given conditional approval for publishing philological studies in Gazeta Literară, after a period during which the communist regime had denied him employment. The magazine was not allowed to host any of his articles in the periods before the state holidays, when any suspect or penitent author was unpublishable. Ştefan Agopian, \\"La România Literară (XV)\\", in Academia Caţavencu, July 29, 2009Călinescu & Vianu, p.147-148 Cioculescu had reportedly not realized the implications of this restriction, and, wanting to ensure continuity, contributed a festive piece on \\"socialist construction\\", sending it to the censor right before May Day. According to Călinescu, Georgescu \\"purely and simply exploded\\" when presented with the text.Călinescu & Vianu, p.148 Writer Ştefan Agopian, who befriended Georgescu after that date, nevertheless notes that the critic made a point of specifying that he had saved Cioculescu's life by preventing his arrest over political grounds, and that he had been responsible for allowing him to publish again. His role in the censorship process reportedly earned Georgescu personally the hostility of poet Ion Barbu, a modernist from Lovinescu's circle, whose political opinions and artistic tenets had made him virtually unpublishable. According to Valeriu Râpeanu, Barbu came up to the critic in Bucharest's Casa Capşa restaurant, and defiantly questioned the logic and effectiveness of censorship. Barbu's argument compared the regime with parents who fuss over the possibility of their child masturbating to the point where that child becomes determined to try it, and concluding: \\"That's what you communists are doing, by always telling poets not to imitate Ion Barbu, [and] 'don't follow up on Ion Barbu's poetry, be very careful because it's decadent poetry'. They will start to seek me out and read me.\\" Contradictory aspects The degree to which Georgescu's involvement with Socialist Realism affected his work, beyond a surface level, is judged minor by several commentators. Matei Călinescu, Gabriel Dimisianu and Agopian reserve favorable words for his literary taste, contrasting it with the cultural environment of the 1950s (which they define as the source of mediocrity).Călinescu & Vianu, p.149; Dimisianu & Elvin, p.93 Călinescu records how, during meetings with his friends at Casa Capşa and in other contexts, Paul Georgescu refused to talk official literature while openly discussing his admiration for foreign writers whose aesthetic choices or open rejection of Stalinism had made them unpublishable behind the Iron Curtain: André Gide, Arthur Koestler, André Malraux, Ignazio Silone and Paul Valéry.Călinescu & Vianu, p.149-150 According to a late memoir by Eugen Campus, one of his subordinates at Gazeta Literară during the early 1950s, the editor was \\"prudent\\", keeping \\"underneath the dreary ashes of an apparent conformism, the lively embers of his ideals.\\"Manea, p.209 Ţoiu sees Georgescu, Titus Popovici and Belu Zilber as advocating \\"the utopia of liberal socialism\\" during the 1950s, while Călinescu believes that his fellow critic \\"despised\\" Romanian communist leader Gheorghiu-Dej while respecting \\"the system which [Gheorghiu-Dej] had patronized\\", before the PCR refused De-Stalinization and accepted nationalism (implicitly marginalizing Georgescu's internationalism). Cosaşu also argues that Georgescu's own image as a \\"Stalinist\\" came from his refusal to equate Soviet and Nazi German totalitarianisms, and from his claim that Stalin \\"has saved all the capitalists\\" during and after World War II. The distance Georgescu took from the official tenets reflected on his literary choices, a process which ended with his own marginalization. In the 1989 obituary, Nicolae Manolescu noted that Încercări critice \\"are not the most 'purblind' [writings] of their time\\", their author being \\"on the side of valuable literature, as much as there was of that, [and] against underachievements\\". Literary chronicler and translator Iulia Arsintescu thus believes that, for all problems they raise, Georgescu's earliest critical essays can still be considered \\"frequentable\\" (the category, Arsintescu believes, even stretches to include Georgescu's pronouncements on the controversial Socialist Realist Alexandru Toma). Matei Călinescu places stress on the relationship between the enforcement of PCR directives at Gazeta Literară and Georgescu's promotion of modernism and young poetry. He notes how, in 1958, the editor published a \\"Zhdanovist\\" essay targeting directly Ion Barbu, which included negative comments on sampled poems, and how it was later revealed to him that this was a covert method to make Barbu's poetry somehow available to the general public.Călinescu & Vianu, p.306-307 This, Călinescu writes, was a \\"cynical lesson\\" in how to use ideological texts as \\"a verbal package with a minimal content.\\"Călinescu & Vianu, p.308 In reference to Cioculescu and his potential arrest, Agopian cited Georgescu saying: \\"He had done nothing wrong, so he was still usable, we could not afford to lose a guy like Cioculescu just so we could have our prisons filled. Cioculescu's luck was that the idiots upstairs listened to me.\\" The same commentator contends that, by not allowing his fellow critic to publish politicized texts, Georgescu may have intended to save his reputation. In addition, Călinescu cites Georgescu's reference to those writers who gave in to pressures and accepted to contribute propaganda as having paid their \\"entrance to the circus\\", as well as his belief that \\"keeping a private diary today [ca. 1957] is the equivalent of a denunciation.\\"Călinescu & Vianu, p.287-288 In Radu Cosaşu's account, although a \\"dogmatic Marxist\\", his older friend saw no link between the ideology and Socialist Realist guidelines, and never pressured him to write \\"for the party\\", while Dimisianu discusses Georgescu's \\"generosity\\" and \\"warmth\\" in respect to his friends and disciples.Dimisianu & Elvin, p.93-94 The positive accounts, conservative critic Dan C. Mihăilescu notes, gravitate around the perception that Georgescu discreetly criticized Stalinism from the Left Opposition camp, and was a covert adherent to Trotskyism. Mihăilescu records several currents in interpreting Georgescu's relationship with the regime: \\"The generation colleagues and communist party comrades remember the writer's unshakable faith in the socio-political ideals of Trotskyism, in parallel with his non-extinguishable idiosyncrasy toward all things on the Right [...]. The literary generations of the '50-'80 years remember the opportunistic-cynical figure of the party kulturnik, the aficionado of literary backstairs, the artisan of cabals compromising the entire realm of old aristocrats, the 'dictator' at Viaţa Românească, the man always in Leonte Răutu's shadow\\". In Matei Călinescu's view, the Gazeta Literară editor, whom he calls \\"an evil and intolerant man, but with aspects of genuine generosity\\", was in essence \\"an intellectual Stalinist [...] and, on top of it, sentimentally a Troskyist.\\"Călinescu & Vianu, p.150 He believes Georgescu to have been \\"hyper-intelligent\\", but argues that his cognitive skills were being harnessed \\"by the most dogmatic and brutal form of stupidity.\\" He also writes that episodes such as the promotion of Barbu's poetry through virulent criticism define \\"aberrant, downright schizophrenic forms [of behavior].\\"Călinescu & Vianu, p.306 The liberalization years Progressively after Nicolae Ceauşescu's arrival to power, an event which signaled the start of relative liberalization together with the open encouragement of nationalism, Georgescu responded to the official policies. Dimisianu mentions Georgescu, together with Miron-Radu Parashivescu, Marin Preda, Zaharia Stancu, Baconsky, Dumitrescu, Jebeleanu, Bogza, and Cohmălniceanu, among those who actively helped his generation, as \\"writers and literary critics who had initially paid a toll to proletkultism, and [...] were silently parting with it, returning to literature, to actual criticism\\".Dimisianu & Elvin, p.91 At that stage, Bedros Horasangian argues, Georgescu \\"played along\\", transforming himself from a \\"not at all naïve or innocent critic and literary ideologue\\" into a person who acknowledged the change in perspective. According to Horasangian, Georgescu himself was \\"joking that 'Winter and summer are different things'—he probably always knew, just like Leonte Răutu, who, the more vigilant he was (or appeared), the more intensely he was reading 'rightist' French newspapers and magazines\\". During a 2004 interview, reflecting on the value of literature produced under communism, literary historian Alex. Ştefănescu recalled: \\"Paul Georgescu had a saying he used when I was asking him with half-irony: 'Mr. Paul, how was it possible that you wrote so badly in the years of dogmatism?'. 'Forget that, dear—he would say—the problem is that I couldn't tell I was writing badly'.\\" \\"Dezbatere: Literatura Română în timpul comunismului de Alex. Ştefănescu\\", in România Literară, Nr. 21/2004 Former protégé Agopian assessed that, as late as the 1980s, Paul Georgescu had \\"the aura of an inffalible critic.\\" The new parameters of his criticism became evident in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Before the April Theses put an end to liberalization, Georgescu joined a new wave of anthologists and commentators openly engaged in the recovery of modernism, or calling for artistic innovation (among them were Alexandru Ivasiuc, Adrian Marino, Saşa Pană and Eugen Simion).F. Mihăilescu, p.125-126 He was also revisiting the legacy of Junimea, contributing the preface to a 1967 complete edition of Maiorescu's essays. The piece focused on Maiorescu's expansion of the \\"art for art's sake\\" principle, his belief that truth and beauty were opposed to each other, and his move from the rejection of literary patriotism to the praise of Romanian folklore as an aesthetic model.Ornea, p.28, 33, 38 Georgescu's colleague Z. Ornea called the study \\"excellent\\", commenting that it \\"has restored many truths about the great critic [Maiorescu]'s work.\\"Ornea, p.28 In a letter to Ion Simuţ, Georgescu defined himself as \\"an analyst\\", and his books as \\"psycho-social analyses\\". Using the Marxist terminology of dialectical materialism, he argued: \\"Destiny is the dialectical tension between temperament and the socio-historical structure.\\" Basing himself on an interpretation of French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, he also expressed his belief in \\"literary relativism\\". In Georgescu's own metaphorical definition, which he claimed to have outlined for the benefit of his fellow critic Manolescu, good criticism is characterized by how \\"structural obsessions\\" and \\"affixed ideas\\" that helped it avoid being \\"washed out into the Black Sea\\". He also saw a psychological benefit to writing: \\"[It] defends us internally, provides us with internal force. Wise guys manage things easily, but let's not envy them: they shall never know the great joys we experience through work. They are all poor human beings.\\" Georgescu's political options remained with the far left, and explicitly with Trotskyism.Călinescu & Vianu, p.149-150; Manea, p.210 Paul Cernat, \\"M.H.S. şi Comedia Lumii pe Dos\\", in Cuvântul, Nr. 378-379, December 2008-January 2009, republished by the Romanian Cultural Institute's România Culturală This process, Cosaşu writes, made Georgescu \\"a multi-faceted Leninist\\" with a secret sympathy for anarchism, who \\"had fought to bring into power a system which he justified, while despising virtually all of its officials\\". According to literary critic Paul Cernat, \\"[his] break with dogmatism manifested itself only on a strictly aesthetic level\\", while Agopian stated: \\"Paul Georgescu used to work for the PCR's C[entral] C[ommittee], where he was a martinet. He was, however, a man so extraordinary, that it was impossible to make an accusation of his militant Marxism. He was a Marxist, but he was not a Ceauşist.\\" Also according to Agopian: \\"The ferocious Marxist that he was always supplanted by the mocking essayist born in the south of the country\\". Cernat, who compares Georgescu with his generation colleague, the fantasy and experimental author Mircea Horia Simionescu, also notes that their main difference between them was the political choices as reflected in their individual works: while Georgescu continued to ridicule \\"bourgeois conventions\\", the anti-communist Simionescu, whose \\"incompatibility with the Party's ideology was irremediably total [...] forgave nothing.\\" Having been introduced to Georgescu during the final stage of the critic's career, Manea retold one of his confessions from the time: \\"I suppose what you heard about me is that I am a Stalinist. I'm not a Stalinist, Mr. Norman, know that. I was with Leiba Trotsky.\\"Manea, p.210 Manea also wrote: \\"What struck about [him] was the contradiction between the extraordinary mobility of spirit and the Affixed Idea. [...] How did he pacify his disappointments and regenerate his militantism after having seen with his eyes, and his mind, and his heart the nightmarish masquerade of the totalitarian state?\\" He added: \\"The socialist tension between the 'conserved' ideal and the putrid reality maintained in those who gave up neither contempt nor complicity a sort of narcissistic and megalomaniac blindness.\\"Manea, p.207-208 Ceauşescu-era disputes According to literary historian Mircea Martin, Georgescu was one of the intellectuals who, after the liberalization episode, were involved in the large debates over the interpretation of history and the nature of Romanian culture. In this interpretation, he stood among those who protected the ideals of Europeanism and cosmopolitanism, in the company of other communists dissatisfied with the official line (Crohmălniceanu, Savin Bratu, Vera Călin, Paul Cornea, Silvian Iosifescu), of former political prisoners of communism (Nicolae Balotă, Ovidiu Cotruş, Ştefan Augustin Doinaş, Adrian Marino, Ion Negoiţescu, Alexandru Paleologu), and of many younger figures who were just making their debut on the literary scene.Mircea Martin, \\"Cultura română între comunism şi naţionalism (II)\\" , in Revista 22, Nr. 660, October 2002 This community, Martin notes, resisted the ethnic nationalism and Protochronism promoted with acquiescence from the regime, by such figures as Paul Anghel, Eugen Barbu, Edgar Papu, Mihai Ungheanu and Dan Zamfirescu. Paul Georgescu's contemporaries describe his enduring passion for ideological conflict. Nicolae Manolescu, \\"Constantin Ţoiu, romancier şi memorialist\\", in Ramuri, Nr. 03/2008 He believed Romanian literature itself to have been shaped by the conflict between two stances, both exemplified by 19th century authors: on one hand, the pessimistic and emphatic Mihai Eminescu; on the other, the sarcastic and often absurdist Ion Luca Caragiale. Such confrontational stances were reportedly reflected in his regular activities: according to Cosaşu, Georgescu reacted to the power regained by the Securitate secret police under Ceauşescu, and ridiculed its tactics by circulating political jokes and gossip. He reportedly made no secret of his antipathy for Ceauşescu himself.Călinescu & Vianu, p.150; Manea, p.206 In parallel, he believed Romania had to choose between the Iron Guard's return as national communism and a consecrated form of Marxism-Leninism.Călinescu & Vianu, p.150; Manea, p.206-207, 221 During the mid-1960s, Norman Manea writes, the emerging nationalist press attacked Georgescu as a \\"dogmatic\\", being joined in this effort by some \\"who had asserted themselves, like Georgescu, through more than a few compromises and collaborations\\".Manea, p.208-209 Also according to Manea, Georgescu's fear that Ceauşescu would endorse neofascist terror resulted in a mental breakdown, for which he had to be hospitalized in the late 1960s. The writer also records how Georgescu had ceased his collaboration with Scînteia over this type of ideological differences, and how he showed contempt the radical nationalist discourse promoted by Eugen Barbu's Luceafărul and Săptămîna or by Adrian Păunescu's Flacăra.Manea, p.211-212, 216 Georgescu had an increasingly hostile relationship with Marin Preda, whom he allegedly suspected of having joined the nationalist circles after publishing the novels Delirul (1975) and Cel mai iubit dintre pământeni (1980).Manea, p.217-218 Manea cites Georgescu's portrayals of Preda as a promiscuous alcoholic, as well as his publicized and purposefully ambiguous definition of the younger author as a \\"national writer\\", but also recounts that the critic was moved to tears by Preda's 1980 death. In parallel, his encouragement of conflict intertwined with his definitions of ethics in relation to communist justice. In his dialogue with Florin Mugur, Georgescu dismissively qualified idealism and altruism as \\"vegetarianism\\". Călinescu notes that, although himself dissatisfied with life under Ceauşescu, Georgescu was \\"angered\\" by news that his former employee had defected and settled in the United States, and had come to see Călinescu's action as determined by his distant kinship with nationalist philosopher Mircea Vulcănescu. A similar story is told by Norman Manea, whom the regime pressured to leave Romania, which he eventually did in 1986.Manea, p.212-214, 218- 219 Cosaşu, who had by then grown disillusioned with communism, recalls having engaged his friend about the need to repent, a point Georgescu received with amusement, and, as a stated atheist, sarcastically compared with belief in the Last Judgment. For Manea, the critic's refusal to make a complete break with communism was explained by a number of factors. According to the novelist, Georgescu was by then well-informed of the Gulag and other crimes of communism, as well as of comparisons they raised with the Holocaust, but may have expected a moment when the ideology would harness \\"his qualities, not just his flaws, in service of the much-imagined goal.\\"Manea, p.205 Being frustrated in this expectation, Manea proposes, the former activist may have actually been radicalized further under Ceauşescu's rule, once confronted with the \\"morass which suffocated growing sections of the population, the misery, the fear, the demagogy.\\" A survivor of the Holocaust in Romania, the young novelist recorded how his allusive comparisons between crimes of the Ion Antonescu regime and those of communism irritated Georgescu, who once told him: \\"Given your biography, you should be with us.\\" As a reflection of his participation in disputes, Georgescu became notorious for his sarcastic puns and the monikers he assigned to his friends and enemies alike. According to Dimisianu: \\"Granted, he was foul-mouthed, spiteful, always lashing out with his words, the creator of amusing nicknames that were quickly circulated in the literary milieus, and being that way also made him enemies, and even made some regard him as a malevolent, corrosive spirit. He was not.\\" He reportedly braved the authorities by branding the Ceauşescu regime a revival of the Iron Guard, and habitually referred to the PCR leader as Căpitanul (\\"The Captain\\", a title associated with the Iron Guard leader Corneliu Zelea Codreanu), while his moniker for Scînteia editor Nicolae Dragoş was Răcănel (\\"Tree Frog\\", but also \\"Little Soldier\\").Manea, p.210, 212 He also casually referred to Alain Robbe-Grillet, the French Nouveau Roman author, as Rochie-Friptă (\\"Toasted Gown\\"), in turn a word-by-word translation of the humorous homonym robe grillé. Other nicknames were structured around obscenities, and included his reference to an unnamed colleague as Linge Cur (\\"Ass-licker\\").Manea, p.211 He integrated such names in his regular speech, creating a secret system of references that his closest friends were required to learn.Manea, p.211-213 Paul Georgescu's receptive chronicles and critical pronouncements on literature, often written from a maverick perspective, have themselves raised questions. In a 2008 interview, Norman Manea himself stated having been \\"shocked\\" to learn that Georgescu considered him a successor to interwar novelist Camil Petrescu and Ion Luca Caragiale, and noted that he had never before taken this into consideration. Marta Petreu, \\"Conversaţii cu Norman Manea\\", in Apostrof, Nr. 9/2008; republished by the Romanian Cultural Institute's România Culturală Radu Petrescu reported being surprised by Georgescu's belief to have discerned far-reaching references to the political and cultural context in his novel Matei Iliescu. Arguing that, for all his intent of escaping daily pressures through literature, \\"a real flight is never truly possible\\", Petrescu concluded: \\"After all, it could be like [Georgescu said].\\" Radu Petrescu, \\"Despre roman (II)\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 97-98, January 2002 Fiction writings Style Georgescu's work as a novelist, largely independent from his political affiliations, endures as his most praised contribution. Norman Manea defines his older colleague as \\"an important and unmistakable writer, [who] endures, like all important and unmistakable writers, regardless of their obsessions and political options.\\"Manea, p.220 He adds: \\"[Georgescu was] a hero of the book, not of the Revolution.\\"Manea, p.221 A main characteristic of Paul Georgescu's fiction is its evolution at the margin of parody, which many times implies a humorous subtext. According to Arsintescu, this attitude unites Georgescu the critic with Georgescu the storyteller: \\"The link [is] the spirit, the charm of a razor-sharp intelligence, the gigantic guffaw (fond? sarcastic?) behind which he gazes upon the world.\\" In contrast to his ideological tenets, Georgescu the fiction author is perceived by many as a postmodernist, whose reinterpretation of traditional themes reaches the stage of meta-literature and intertextuality.F. Mihăilescu, p.280 Thus, he is believed by Ştefan Agopian to have been Romania's \\"first postmodernist\\", whose contributions came before the Optzecişti writers were themselves grouped under the \\"postmodern\\" label. Radu Cosaşu notes that, although he considered himself one of the neorealists, Georgescu rejected works by the realist greats (from Honoré de Balzac and Émile Zola to Fyodor Dostoyevsky). The writer himself spoke of \\"modern prose\\" as determined by a goal \\"to rehabilitate regular life, composed from a number of actions, not just one, in which suspense and explosive dénouement exist only rarely, or where several non-coincident interferences coexist.\\" Reportedly, he defined literature itself as a \\"trance of nuances\\".Manea, p.216-217 According to Manea, Georgescu's literary universe took on a definitive form only in the late 1960s or early 1970s.Manea, p.203 Georgescu's narratives of the period drew their themes from, and often consciously imitated, a diversity of literary sources. Commentators emphasize that Ion Luca Caragiale, a main figure in 19th century Romanian humor, was an important inspiration for several of his works. He is also commonly believed to have been stimulated by the novels of George Călinescu. Other Romanian authors who influenced Georgescu, or whose style was pastiched by Georgescu, include Camil Petrescu and Ion Luca's son Mateiu Caragiale, alongside Duiliu Zamfirescu, Alexandru Odobescu and Mihai Eminescu. In parallel, Radu Petrescu believed his fellow novelist to have been \\"all to evident[ly]\\" inspired by the interwar novelist Anton Holban, particularly in his Vîrsele tinereţii. Paul Cernat, \\"Ce nu se vede\\" (II), in Observator Cultural, Nr. 157, February 2003 Particularly during the 1960s, Georgescu blended these sources with influences from the trends of 20th century French literature: the Nouveau Roman of Alain Robbe- Grillet and Jean-Paul Sartre's Marxist existentialism. He was at the time taking his examples from \\"engaged authors\\" such as Sartre and André Malraux, resenting the independent road taken by Albert Camus. Among the other international authors, Georgescu preferred John Dos Passos, Franz Kafka, Marcel Proust, and James Joyce. Cosaşu recalls that his older colleague would seek inspiration directly in the pages of Joyce's Ulysses. In Georgescu's novels, the strictly fictional was often found side by side with concrete autobiographical elements. The recipe was noted by critic Lucian Raicu: \\"the bookish as much as the intimately lived experience [Raicu's italics]\\". Raicu adds: \\"The sense of abundant, diverse, life, of a fascinating materiality, endlessly harasses the habits of the bookish man, who lives among models and masterpieces as if in his element, and eventually fuses with them\\".Manea, p.221 Georgescu's works, alongside those of Norman Manea, were also case studies for literary historian Liviu Petrescu, who documented the extent of self-referential and intransitive prose in Romanian postmodernism. Manea cites Ion Simuţ in discussing the main topic of Georgescu's narratives: \\"A dynamic rationale facing a world lacking in dynamism, [and] almost inert.\\" From the early stories to Vara baroc Georgescu progressively earned recognition as an author just as he was largely withdrawn from public life. The 1973 short story Pilaf, a part-memoir piece with philosophical undertones, is rated by Bedros Horasangian \\"an exceptional prose piece, perhaps the best to have been written by Paul Georgescu\\". Horasangian commends its \\"exceptional stylistic refinement\\", and notes that the eponymous dish is to Georgescu what the madeleine is to Proust (see In Search of Lost Time). Dan C. Mihăilescu, who recalls the novella was \\"famous\\", also judges it to be one of the \\"peaks\\" in Georgescu's writing career, while Arsintescu deems the piece \\"sensational\\", and the 3 nuvele volume itself \\"excellent\\". The recollection aspect in Georgescu's prose was also present in other writings of the period, including Doctorul Poenaru, whose eponymous protagonist is his own father. Set in the interwar period, Revelion introduces the character Gabriel Dimancea, a schoolteacher, journalist, aspiring novelist and World War I veteran who is absorbed by the fate of his fellow human beings. Dimancea is also the protagonist of Vara baroc, a volume identified by Dan C. Mihăilescu as the second \\"peak\\" among Georgescu's contributions. In this narrative, the protagonist's dreams of social revolution contrast with the immovability and apathy induced by the intense summer heat of Platoneşti, a fictional town in the Bărăgan Plain. According to Ion Simuţ, the volume ranks with other \\"epic episodes set against the Dog Days\\", in novels by \\"Wallachian\\" southerners: Agopian, Ştefan Bănulescu, Fănuş Neagu, Marin Preda, Nicolae Velea. Simuţ likens the narrative to Ivan Goncharov's classic work, Oblomov, noting in particular Dimancea's refusal to engage in productive activities, his wantonness, and belief that sexual intercourse is too tiresome; however: \\"Gabriel Dimancea does not, after all, evolve in the sense of Goncharov's character, because he fights against himself. He becomes the intellectual of frustrated revolt, enduring only as a project—a revolt frustrated by the adverse meteorology. One could say—exaggerating a little, for the sake of paraphrase—that his revolution (interior and social) is postponed by the torpor.\\" This process is reflected in Dimancea's conversations with estate leaseholder Maltezi, whose steady questioning of the schoolteacher's revolutionary ideas and repeated distractions contribute to Dimancea's growing acceptance of inactivity, failure and moral dissolution. Against the summer- enhanced steadiness of regular life in the Kingdom of Romania, the novel sets the rising threat of fascism, depicting in particular Dimancea's growing fear toward the political agitator Corneliu Zelea Codreanu and his embryonic Iron Guard. Simuţ believes the events in the novel may refer to 1926, the \\"political parenthesis\\" between National Liberal regimes, when the People's Party of Alexandru Averescu confronts the National Peasantist opposition. The narrative language of Vara baroc has also drawn the critical interest. Citing the book as a prime example, Dan C. Mihăilescu called its author \\"a monster of brilliant loquacity\\". Commenting on the use of word plays and the accumulation of metaphors, Simuţ argues: \\"[these] are put to use into a signification which goes beyond simple gratuitousness; language is to Gabriel Dimancea a windscreen that emerges suddenly, like a wall, in front of those who seek pathways toward understanding him and uncovering his secret.\\" The dense nature of the account, Simuţ believes, doubles as a pace-maintaining technique, to make up for the steadiness of the plot, to entertain by means of a \\"comedy of language\\", to illustrate the breakdown of intelligent behavior, and to blur the lines between real and imagined. He notes: \\"Loquacity is the illusion of action and engagement [...]. The real and the fantastical short-circuit one another.\\" Final works Georgescu was especially prolific in the final part of his career, when he reputedly identified with the slogan anul şi romanul (\\"a new novel every year\\"). According to Iulia Arsintescu, their quality declined as their author became \\"plagued by an illness that was harder and harder to bear.\\" Beginning with Mai mult ca perfectul, Georgescu was creating a new cycle, with a focus on Huzurei. The narrator Miron Perieţeanu, himself a fictional version of Georgescu, tells the successive stories of Ioan, Luca, Matei and Marcu (names based on the Romanian versions for the Four Evangelists). The events in these novels also take place during the early 20th century, covering the 1907 peasants' revolt as well as the World War I occupation of the country. According to literary chronicler Ioan Holban, the Huzurei setting is \\"a desolate place, stupefied by the torpor, with squeamish people always sweaty from the heat, moving idly from one tavern to another [...] and devoting themselves to that almighty goddess that is the siesta [...]. This is only a first impression, for Huzurei is 'the living citadel' of its time [...], grouping, in between its ridiculous houses and streets, a diverse world, caught in the midst of a struggle over power and money: [here] crimes are being committed, intrigues, drug traffic networks and 'wholesale' exchanges are being set up, politics are hotly debated, predictions are being made, investigations, chases take place, dramas are being consumed, people eat vigorously, and nubile girls are being sold (bought) [...].\\" The Huzurei narratives as a whole are thought by Cosaşu equal in value to some of their acclaimed predecessors: George Călinescu's Bietul Ioanide and Marin Preda's Moromeţii. With Solstiţiu tulburat, Georgescu was building on old novelistic themes, borrowing his characters directly from works by Duiliu Zamfirescu and George Călinescu. In Arsintescu's view, these echoes are blended to create \\"an entirely new and utterly modern novel.\\" According to Nicolae Manolescu, it may be the only such work in Romanian literature (Manolescu also wonders if there are any such writings in other national segments of modern literature). Paul Cernat notes that the fiction also blends the real and the imagined, being, together with Horasangian's Sala de aşteptare (\\"Waiting Room\\", 1987), compatible with the historical fiction techniques used by American author E. L. Doctorow in his Ragtime. Paul Cernat, \\"Un roman retro despre identitatea americană\\", at Editura LiterNet, January 9, 2008; retrieved February 15, 2009 Legacy Influence and posthumous disputes As author of fiction, Paul Georgescu had a small but dedicated following. Iulia Arsintescu recounts that, like her, a select few readers from Romania and other Eastern Bloc countries had discovered Georgescu's under-appreciated novels by accident, and had soon after become his devotees. Among Georgescu's early admirers, Horasangian lists himself and author Florin Mugur, noting that the latter, a \\"very careful reader\\", used to underline selected passages in Georgescu's work, where he believed a deeper meaning was detectable. From the authors to have come into contact with Paul Georgescu, Ion Simuţ continued to consider himself the critic's disciple after his mentor died. A high school in Țăndărei was posthumously renamed in Paul Georgescu's honor. Georgescu's legacy and influence as an essayist and author of fiction remained marginal in Romania's post-communist transition, a fact which caused several critics to react negatively. Hostility toward him was reportedly widespread in the literary community at the time of his death, which, in his 1989 obituary for the author, Nicolae Manolescu equated with ingratitude: \\"the 'trifles' of daily life [which Georgescu provided to his peers] have become essential in the biographies of aspiring writers.\\" Manea also wrote: \\"plenty among Paul's former friends and admirers have enclosed themselves into an opaque conjectural silence, others have rushed in to 'cleanse' themselves of the unseasonable connection.\\" Literary critic Daniel Cristea-Enache defines Georgescu as \\"a critic and a prose writer who should not be omitted by any serious work of literary history\\", while his colleague Cernat refers to Georgescu as \\"unfairly forgotten\\". Horasangian believes him to have been \\"completely forgotten\\", \\"ignored\\", and \\"taken out of the circuit.\\" Cristea- Enache adds that, with time, \\"our, how should I put it?, indecent indifference [has been] shadowing the name and bibliography of an important writer who is no longer among us\\". The Georgescu-Simuţ correspondence was published in 2000 as Învăţăturile unui venerabil prozator bucureştean către un tânăr critic din provincie (\\"The Teachings of a Venerable Prose Writer from Bucharest to a Young Provincial Critic\\"). In his review of that year, Cristea-Enache called it \\"one of the most beautiful, most energizing and at the same time most impressive books I have read lately.\\" Dimisianu sees in them proof of \\"how very human this 'devil' could prove himself to be, how full of warmth, how much troubled by his friend's troubles\\". Reflecting on Georgescu's fiction, Ioan Holban notes that, during Romania's transitional stage, Țăndărei came to resemble Huzurei more and more, especially after it became the center of a human trafficking and illegal immigration scandal pitting United Kingdom authorities against members of the local Romani community. Controversies surrounding Georgescu and his fellow communist literary figures resurfaced in late 2008, when Nicolae Manolescu published the synthesis Istoria critică a literaturii române (\\"The Critical History of Romanian Literature\\"). On the other side, the debate involved Dan C. Mihăilescu, who had earlier criticized other intellectuals for upholding a positive image of Georgescu the novelist while \\"neglect[ing] the other bio-bibliographic compartments of a cultural and political doctrinaire\\", defining it as \\"an error.\\" Reviewing Manolescu's book for Idei în Dialog magazine, he reproached the author being too lenient on authors whose public image was affected by their association with the communist regime or the communist ideology, and of being too dismissive of Constantin Noica, a far right thinker of the interwar period whom national communists had come to respect.Dan C. Mihăilescu, \\"Cronicarul în cumpăna istoriei\\", in Idei în Dialog, Nr. 1(52), January 2009 Mihăilescu asked: \\"Does one wish to turn into alleviating circumstance for the likes of Petru Dumitriu, Crohmălniceanu, Maria Banuş, Paul Georgescu, Nina Cassian, Gellu Naum or Edgar Papu all that becomes an aggravating circumstance with Noica?\\" He agreed that Manolescu had a liberty of interpretation, based on his \\"rationalist, enlightened, playful structure, clearly hostile to nationalist metaphysics\\", but argued that his pronouncements on Noica were unfair. To Manolescu's claim that \\"no Romanian intellectual from the communist years was more conflicting than Noica\\", Dan C. Mihăilescu replied with counterexamples of communist supporters (Georgescu, Crohmălniceanu, Tudor Arghezi, George Călinescu, Geo Dumitrescu and Mihail Sadoveanu). In fiction Georgescu's impact on literary life was also reflected by his portrayals in fiction. According to Manea, Marin Preda modeled more than one of his characters on Paul Georgescu.Manea, p.217 In Istoria critică a literaturii române, Nicolae Manolescu identifies characters based on Georgescu in two contemporary novels. One of these fictional figures is Ion Mincu, a minor presence in Preda's Cel mai iubit dintre pământeni; the other is Mr. Leo, the protagonist of Constantin Ţoiu's Căderea în lume (\\"Falling into the World\\", 1987), a physically disabled communist who plays host to the lionized literary society of Bucharest during a New Year's Eve celebration. In what Manolescu describes as an \\"exceptional\\" part of the latter book, Ţoiu turns the party into political confrontation, opposing Leo to the younger Babis Vătăşescu, who has just discovered his family's past involvement with the fascist Iron Guard. Also according to Manolescu, the book evades the official \\"stencil\\" of Socialist Realist writers such as Petru Dumitriu, and the censorship of the times, by depicting Vătăşescu's fascist uncle as having \\"immense intellectual radiance and fundamental moral honesty\\", while Mr. Leo himself is not \\"the hero without fear and beyond reproach\\". Manolescu concludes: \\"in the ideological duel, there is neither winner nor loser. The novelist's objective perspective is absolutely amazing if we are to consider the late 1980s, when Căderea saw print.\\" Critic and essayist Ioana Macrea-Toma also notes Georgescu's depiction in Ţoiu's novel, believing it to constitute the author's \\"retaliation\\", and noting that both Georgescu and Eugen Barbu had reserves about seeing the volume published. Under anagramed names, Georgescu, Cosaşu, Dumitriu, and fellow writers Eugen Barbu, Lucia Demetrius, Victor Eftimiu, Nicolae Labiş and Zaharia Stancu are characters in Tinereţea unui comisar politic (\\"The Youth of a Political Commissar\\"), a novel by the Romanian-born French author Miron Bergmann. Adriana Bittel, \\"Un roman autobiografic\\", in România Literară, Nr. 7/2005 A former Gazeta Literară staff member, Bergmann had defected in 1964.

Betrothal  Eleanor was the eldest child and daughter of King Ferdinand IV of Castile by his wife, Constance of Portugal. At the age of four Eleanor was engaged to James, the eldest son and heir apparent of King James II of Aragon, through the agreements reached in the Meeting of Calatayud of 1311 between Ferdinand IV of Castile and James II. The marriage between Maria, daughter of James II, with Peter, brother of Ferdinand IV, was celebrated at the same time. Shortly after, Eleanor was sent to the Aragonese court to be raised there as the future queen. When she was five years old, in September 1312, King Ferdinand IV died. A year later, in November 1313, Queen Constance died as well. Eleanor's grandmother, Maria de Molina, ruled on behalf of Eleanor's young brother, King Alfonso XI of Castile. The young James, despite his betrothal to Eleanor, was eager to receive the sacred orders and to enter a monastery. Pope John XXII intervened to remind James of his duties. In view of the situation, King James II and his son, whose relationship was strained due to the reluctance of the latter to fulfill his court obligations, signed a document before a notary in October 1319, on the eve of the marriage ceremony, where the younger James promised to marry. Later, in an interview between father and son, both agreed that the young James should be only present at the bridal mass, which would be officiated in the city of Gandesa, but leaving undiscussed the question of whether the marriage should be consummated, given his opposition to the consummation, and taking into account that the commitments with the Kingdom of Castile and León only forced the celebration of the marriage.  Failed unions  On 18 October 1319 the wedding ceremony between James of Aragon and Eleanor of Castile took place. James, according to the chronicles of the time, refused to give the kiss of peace during the ceremony, and James II had to do it. After the ceremony, officiated by the Archbishop of Tarragona, the bridegroom again transmitted to his father his desire to renounce his rights to the throne and enter a convent. After the wedding ceremony, and after a discussion with his father, he fled on horseback, leaving his wife abandoned, and in December 1319, renounced his rights to the throne of Aragon in the Convent of San Francisco of Tarragona. Immediately, he took the habit of the Knights Hospitaller in the Convent of Santo Domingo of the same city. Alfonso, King James II's younger son, was proclaimed heir apparent. The rejection of Eleanor could have caused serious diplomatic incidents between the Castilian and Aragonese courts. James II informed Eleanor's grandmother, Queen Maria, about his regret for the actions of his eldest son, incomprehensible to him. During the spring of 1320 Eleanor remained lodged in the city of Tortosa; during her stay there, James II and Alfonso became aware that the younger James planned to recover his wife and his rights to the throne, and the conspiracy was thwarted by his father. After her stay in Tortosa, Eleanor lived in the cities of Zaragoza, Calatayud and Ateca, from where some Castilian ricohombres returned her to the Kingdom of Castile and León. Once in her homeland, Eleanor retired to the Abbey of Santa María la Real de Las Huelgas, although she never took the veil. In early 1325, King Edward II of England proposed the marriage of his eldest son, Edward, with Eleanor, and sent his proxies to negotiate the terms of the wedding by charter dated 6 February 1325. The union never took place due to Edward’s deposition.Thomas Rymer (1745) Foedera, Conventiones, Literae 3rd Ed. (London), Tome II, Pars II, p. 125.  Queenship  In Ágreda in January 1329 the betrothal between Eleanor and King Alfonso IV of Aragon was signed, and the wedding ceremony took place one month later, on 5 February in the Church of San Miguel de Tarazona. The ceremony was attended by King Alfonso XI of Castile and King James II's children, Maria, John, Peter and Ramón Berenguer. Alfonso IV gave his new wife the city of Huesca and other villages and castles belonging to the Aragonese crown. This marriage improved relations between Castile and Aragon in a renewed alliance formed with the aim of reconquering Granada. The Kingdom of Aragon had breached several marriage agreements, returning to Castile several princesses after breaking off engagements, and this union put an end to the practice. Eleanor became a disruptive influence in Aragon, plotting to advance the interests of her own sons over those of her stepson, Peter, born from Alfonso IV's first marriage with Teresa d'Entença, Countess of Urgell, who died in 1327. She convinced her husband to consent to make significant territorial donations to the children born to them, Ferdinand and John. Alfonso IV was generous and on 28 December 1329, he granted Ferdinand the Marquisate of Tortosa and the cities of Albarracín, Orihuela, Callosa, Guardamar, Alicante, Monforte, Elda, La Mola, Novelda and Aspe. Eleanor's younger son John also received several lordships: Elche, Biel and Bolsa. These donations made by Alfonso IV diminished the territorial patrimony of the crown and mainly affected Peter, producing a climate of resentment in the Aragonese court. Because of this the nobility was divided into two camps. One of the two sides was in favor of Queen Eleanor and her sons, and the other defended the prerogatives of Peter and his full siblings. When the King granted his son Ferdinand the cities of Xàtiva, Alzira, Sagunto, Morella, Borriana and Castellón de la Plana, all located in the Kingdom of Valencia, the local subjects protested, and for this reason the King decided to revoke these last donations.  Widowhood After the death of Alfonso IV, which occurred in the city of Barcelona on 24 January 1336, Queen Eleanor fled to the Kingdom of Castile and León, accompanied by his two sons, Ferdinand and John, fearing the new King Peter IV of Aragon, who was resentful of his stepmother and stepbrothers, because of the postponement suffered since the second marriage of his father. Castle of Castrojeriz, Burgos. In his testament, written in the Monastery of Poblet in August 1333, Alfonso IV bequeathed to his second wife all her jewels and confirmed the possession of the cities that he had given to her in occasion of their wedding, while bequeathing their oldest son Ferdinand the Marquisates of Tortosa and Albarracín. When she escape to the kingdom of Castile, Eleanor took with her great quantities of gold, silver and jewels, although King Peter IV tried to prevent her and her sons from leaving the Kingdom of Aragon. At first, the new monarch moved to confiscate Eleanor's revenues and prosecute her protector Pedro de Ejérica, but in 1338 he confirmed her and her sons in possession of their domains, not wishing to antagonise Castile at a time when the whole Iberian Peninsula was threatened by a new Moorish invasion. Once in Castile, Eleanor continued with her disruptive behavior, this time against her nephew King Peter I. Her youngest son, John of Aragon, was assassinated in Bilbao on 12 June 1358 by order of his cousin the Castilian sovereign, and one year later (March/April 1359), she was murdered in the castle of Castrojeriz by order of her nephew. Four years later, in 1363, her oldest son, Ferdinand of Aragon, was assassinated in Burriana by order of his half-brother, King Peter IV. Burial There is controversy about the final whereabouts of the remains of Queen Eleanor of Castile. There are three places that adjudge the possession of its remains: the Old Cathedral of Lleida, the Church of Nuestra Señora del Manzano in Castrojeriz, and the Abbey of Santa María la Real de Las Huelgas, place of burial of numerous members of the Castilian-Leonese royalty. In the Abbey of Santa María la Real de Las Huelgas was conserved a white marble tomb, placed in the side of the Epistle or of Saint John, that measures 2.25 meters long by 0.67 of width, with cover of limestone, and in which it is affirmed that Queen Eleanor of Castile was buried, although in the epitaph carved in the tomb appeared the name of María of Almenara, also called María of Urgel, daughter of Ermengol VI, Count of Urgell. In its interior are five skulls and bones, as well as coffin boards and pieces of badana of the linings that covered them. It has been assumed that Queen Eleanor was buried in the tombstone of María of Almenara, whose mortal remains could be transferred to another tomb placed in the same nave, and inside which a female mummy, corpulent and of mature age. The tomb which is supposed to contain the remains of Queen Eleanor was trimmed for being too long and wide. On one side of the tomb is the dead woman depicted on her deathbed, and two angels carrying her soul to heaven. To the sides, in arches on columns of twisted shaft, four bishops with miter and staff, and several personages. Below, a series of dogs chasing harpies, and dragons biting. On the other slope of the sepulcher appear vegetal scrolls and, in the corner, between rosettes that separate the words, it appears sculpted the epitaph. Alleged sepulcher of Queen Eleanor in the Old Cathedral of Lleida. In the Old Cathedral of Lleida is a tomb in which on 23 October 1986 the remains of Alfonso IV of Aragon were deposited. Next to him, were also deposited the remains of a young man, identified as the Infante Ferdinand, son of Alfonso IV, and those of an adult woman, who were identified as those of Queen Eleanor, second wife of King Alfonso IV. The remains of Alfonso IV, who had been transferred to the Old Cathedral of Lleida in 1781, remained in the crypt until 1986, when they were placed in a stone tomb, located next to the door of San Berenguer of the cathedral. Alleged sepulcher of Queen Eleanor of Castile in the Church of Nuestra Señora del Manzano of Castrojeriz. In the Church of Nuestra Señora del Manzano of Castrojeriz a tomb is conserved, attributed to the Queen Eleanor de Castile, that is located at the feet of the church, near the baptistery, and was discovered in June 1970, hidden behind a wall of adobe, by the Rescue Mission Group Marqués de Camarasa School Group. From the moment of his discovery, the grave was attributed by the experts to Eleanor, daughter of Ferdinand IV, because the fashion of the sepulcher corresponds with other tombs realized in the middle of the 14th century, as well as by the fact that on its cap appears the sculpted figure of a woman. The assumption that Queen Eleanor was buried in this tomb is supported by certain documents.

Thus we have Albinus, who wrote an introduction to Plato's works, and Alcinous and Apuleius who both wrote manuals of Platonism.Zeller (1895), page 309 From the physician Galen we have fragments of a commentary on the Timaeus.Dickey 2007, page 49 Already though the influence of Aristotle was being felt on the popular Platonism of the day, and we have the figure of Atticus (c. 175) who opposed the eclecticism which had invaded the school and contested the theories of Aristotle as an aberration from Plato. The Neoplatonists though sought to exhibit the philosophical ideas of Plato and Aristotle as a unity. Porphyry (3rd century) attempted in a special work to show the agreement of Aristotelian and Platonist philosophy and wrote a number of commentaries on Plato, Aristotle, and Theophrastus.Zeller (1895), page 323 Additional commentaries on Plato were written by Dexippus, Plutarch of Athens, and Syrianus. A partial translation and commentary in Latin of Plato's Timaeus by Calcidius was significant for being the only substantial work of Plato known to scholars in the Latin west for approximately 800 years.Grant 2004, pages 93-4 The best commentaries date from this era; most of the works of Proclus are commentaries on single dialogues of Plato and similar subjects.Hegel (1896), page 403 The commentaries on Plato were either given in lectures or written; and many have come down to us. Later Neoplatonist commentators on Plato whose works partially survive include Damascius and Olympiodorus. Byzantine commentaries In the Byzantine era, Aristotle was read more often than Plato, because of the importance placed on Aristotle's logical treatises.Kennedy (1999), page 190 A key figure was Arethas, the 10th century Archbishop of Caesarea, who concerned himself with the preservation of the manuscripts of Plato and other ancient writers, and wrote scholia to the texts of Plato in his own hand.Dickey 2007, page 46 By the 11th century enthusiastic admirers of Platonism could be found in figures such as Michael Psellos and John Italus.Angelov (2007), pages 344-5 The only surviving commentary from the late empire is a commentary on the Parmenides by George Pachymeres. Islamic commentaries Compared to Aristotle, Plato figured far less prominently in Islamic philosophy. He was seen more as a symbol and as an inspiration rather than a source of practical philosophy.Platonism in Islamic Philosophy (Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 1998) Islamic Platonism, when it came, was a development within Aristotelian philosophy.Benson (2006), page 445 Far fewer of his works were known to the Islamic world than those of Aristotle. It seems that only the Laws, the Sophist, the Timaeus, and the Republic, were available in Arabic translation. Averroes, who wrote many commentaries on Aristotle, was probably motivated to write his one Platonic commentary, on the Republic, only because he could not find a copy of Aristotle's Politics.Black, page 119 See also *Commentaries on Aristotle *Platonism *Scholia References Sources *Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1896), Lectures on the History of Philosophy, Part One.

It was listed on the London Stock Exchange and was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. History The Company was established in 1969 when S. G. Warburg & Co., the investment bank, won an investment management contract and set up Warburg Investment Management to execute it. In 1987 25% of the business was floated on the London Stock Exchange as Mercury Asset Management. Carol Galley, one of its leading managers, was credited with facilitating the takeovers by Granada of both London Weekend Television in 1994 and Forte Group in 1996. At its peak more than half the companies on the FTSE 100 used Mercury Asset Management for investment management purposes.Merrill Lynch and Mercury Asset Management Combine to Create One of the World's Largest Fund Management Groups Merrill Lynch, 19 November 1997 In 1995 the Company achieved full independence when S. G. Warburg & Co. sold its investment banking business to Swiss Bank Corporation; through a scheme of arrangement the residue of S. G. Warburg & Co. became a subsidiary of Mercury Asset Management and S. G. Warburg & Co. shareholders become shareholders in Mercury Asset Management. The Company was acquired by Merrill Lynch for £3.1bn in 1997. Mercury was rebranded Merrill Lynch Investment Managers (MLIM), which in turn was acquired by Blackrock in 2006. Legacy Five years after Blackrock’s 2006 acquisition of MLIM, one UK media report quoted a consultant as saying: \\"BlackRock is a big firm. But there is more than a trace of Mercury DNA running through it.\\" This was particularly true in Europe where Blackrock’s business was headed until 2015 by James Charrington, who had joined Mercury in 1993. A number of investors who worked at Mercury Asset Management during the late 1980s and 1990s went on to occupy senior positions within the industry in the generation that followed. Nicola Horlick’s career in investment banking began at Mercury, when it was called Warburg.https://citywire.co.uk/wealth-manager/news/nicola- horlick-wins-inaugural-champion-of-change-award/a821092 Before Paul Marshall established Marshall Wace he had worked for Mercury. In 2001, Peter Davies and Stuart Roden went on to establish a successful UK equity fund for Lansdowne Partners. The following year, Anne Richards left to join Edinburgh Fund Managers and onwards to Aberdeen Asset Management where she was CIO before becoming CEO at M&G; Investments in 2014 and at CEO at Fidelity International in 2018. Andreas Utermann left Mercury/MLIM for Allianz, followed two years later by Elizabeth Corley; they co-headed Allianz Global Investors as Global CIO and CEO respectively, from 2012 until 2016; Utermann continued as CEO until 2019. while Corley has joined a number of boards and led a government review on social impact investing. Saker Nusseibeh, the CEO of Hermes Investment Management, began his career at Mercury in 1987. While Carol Galley did not return to fund management following her departure from Mercury in 2001, Stephen Zimmerman her co-head did set up a boutique investment firm, NewSmith Capital Partners, in 2004 along with other former senior managers from Merrill Lynch (Michael Marks, Paul Roy and Check Low, who had joined Merrill via the acquisition of Smith New Court).

The work was hard, as much of the time was spent in wild areas that required him to camp; hunting and cooking his own food. He observed that he saw few older people in this employment and that the work took a heavy toll on his colleagues.From a personal collection of letters. S.A. Hall A friend and roommate from Harvard, Allen Bradshaw Fay, whose father, Edward Allen Fay, was the Vice President of Gallaudet College, suggested that he teach the deaf. Initially his family tried to dissuade him, as they felt that, with his adventurous spirit, he would soon be bored with life as a teacher. But, Hall felt that he could make a contribution to the developing field of deaf education. Gallaudet Hall entered Gallaudet's Normal School, graduating with an MA in Deaf Education in 1893. Following his graduation, he taught at the New York School for the Deaf for two years before teaching mathematics and Latin at Gallaudet. He became president after the retirement of President Edward Miner Gallaudet in 1910. In 1935, President Hall was given an Honorary Doctorate (L.H.D.) by the college.Gallaudet University Archives He felt that, given the opportunity of higher education, there were many fields in which deaf people could excel. He published many articles on the education of the deaf. Family life Hall married Carolyn L. Clarke in June 1895, but she later died of illness in January 1896. In June 1900, he married Ethel Zoe Taylor, who had been a deaf student at Gallaudet, shortly after she earned her BA.

Liber Floridus, 1448. A guivre is a mythical creature similar to a dragon. In legend they were portrayed as serpentine creatures who possessed venomous breath and prowled the countryside of Medieval France. The words \\"guivre\\" (wurm, wyvern [which is derived from it], or serpent) and \\"givre\\" are spelling variations of the more common word \\"vouivre\\". Vouivre, in Franc- Comtois, is the equivalent of the old French word \\"guivre.\\" All these forms are derived ultimately from Latin vīpera, as is English viper. Description and habits Guivres were said to possess a long, serpentine body and a dragon's head. The guivre had horns in its forehead in some accounts, as well. Locally in France it was known as an extremely aggressive creature that would sometimes attack without being provoked. They were afraid of naked humans, and when saw them, blushed and looked away. Documentation points to their residence as being in small bodies of water like pools and lakes, forests, and any damp place. also found in Europe.  La Guivre  Samson of Dol was present at an encounter between a small dragon-like creature (known as \\"La Guivre\\") and a priest. Samson had come to visit Saint Suliao with an entourage of followers. Suliao was impoverished but sought to provide a meal as best as possible for the group. One priest, uneasy with the low quality of food, took a bread roll and hid it under his robe. Almost instantaneously he started convulsing and Suliao pulled apart his bosom, seeing what the man had done. He admonished the priest and removed a hideous serpentine creature from the robe. There he exorcised it and then compelled another man to throw it from the roof of a building in Garot.  Vouivre  Guivres are also well known as vouivres, and the terms have become synonymous. For example, in The Drac: French Tales of Dragons and Demons, the vouivre is depicted as a female creature with dazzling, green scales which emanate sound as the vouivre flies. The vouivre is depicted as greedy, her head crowned with pearls and a golden ring about her tail. The beast in this story stayed in a cave for most of her time, then left to bathe only for a few minutes. According to the Contes et légendes de Franche-Comté, the Vouivre is a unique gigantic snake like dragon, wearing a rubis on its forehead, and using it as its eye.  Literary use  In Steve Alten's The Loch the Loch Ness Monster is originally thought to be a guivre which got into Loch Ness through Moray Firth. The guiuvres were said to be a species of giant eel, a predecessor to the Anguilla. In the 1989 film La Vouivre, the vouivre was a wood nymph.

Many of their products received wide coverage in Popular Mechanics and Popular Science at the time.  History  In 1911, the inventor Gardner T. Eames of Kalamazoo, Michigan filed for a patent on a new type of arbor press, but was unable to secure funding for production. Eames partnered with Herbert H. Everard to create the G.T. Eames Company, under the agreement that the rights to the patent were to be shared between both men. The company started producing the press under the \\"Eames Presses\\" brand with some success. In 1913, Everard died, leaving his controlling share of the firm to his daughter and her husband, John Penniman. Eames eventually became disillusioned with the Pennimans' handling of the company and sold his shares to them for $5,000. Penniman subsequently moved the company to another location in Kalamazoo, renaming it to Atlas Press Company. Eames opened a machine shop and continued to build and sell presses under the old trademark, which eventually led to conflict between the two parties, both of whom claimed exclusivity over the patent, as well as additional improvements made by Eames. Patent dispute In 1919 the Pennimans filed an unfair trade lawsuit against Eames (Atlas Press Co. v. Eames), claiming rights over the trademark, patent and improved design. The case was argued in front of the Michigan Supreme Court, which ruled that Eames had to cease use of the trademark, but refusing the transfer of the improved press to the Atlas company.Michigan Reports, pp. 586-594 Later years In 1920 the company began making and selling small machine tools, including drill presses and lathes, as well as woodworking tools, such as jointers and table saws. They were sold through the Sears catalog, some of them re-branded under the Craftsman name. In 1965, the company changed its name to Clausing Industrial, Inc. and divested its woodworking product lines to focus on industrial machinery. In 1985, the 600 Group acquired parts of Clausing. The Clausing brand is still used today. The 600 Group, which had earlier also acquired the British Colchester and T.S. Harrison lathe brands (in 1954 and 1971, respectively), also recombined the branding to include the Clausing Colchester (North America only) and Colchester Harrison names.

The Labrador Trough or the New Quebec Orogen is a long and wide geologic belt in Canada, extending south-southeast from Ungava Bay through Quebec and Labrador. The trough is a linear belt of sedimentary and volcanic rocks which developed in an Early Proterozoic rift basin. To the west is the Archean Superior Craton. To the east are the rocks of the Archean Rae Craton. The sedimentary rocks and volcanics of the Labrador Trough were intensely deformed and subjected to high grade metamorphism along with the Churchill terrain during the Trans-Hudson orogeny.Kearey, Philip and Frederick Vine, Global Tectonics, Wiley-Blackwell, 2nd ed., 1996, pp. 279-281 It is a northeast extension of the Circum-Superior Belt and is terminated to the south by the Grenville Front Tectonic Zone.Green, J.

It is a large iron ore belt developed on banded iron formations and has had mining operations since 1954.Iron Deposits of the Labrador Trough At least two large magmatic events occurred in the Labrador Trough. The first event 2,170 million years ago engulfed an area of and the second 1,880 million years ago covered a similar area of . Geological history The geological history of the Labrador Trough spans several tens of millions of years ranging from around 2.2 Ga to 1.74 Ga: # Following rifting along the Archean margin of the Superior craton about 2.2 billion years ago, rocks of the western part of the Labrador Trough were deposited. This period corresponds to the onset of first- cycle sedimentation and is characterized by the deposition of immature sediments, slightly alkaline volcanics, and the intrusion of mafic dykes. # Deposition of passive margin sediments, MORB-like mafic volcanism and intrusion of mafic sills characterize most of the first cycle between approximately 2.17 and 2.14 Ga. The end of the cycle (<2.06 Ga) is marked by the deposition of dolomite and chert on a restored platform. # Second-cycle platform and basin sedimentation occurred from 1.88 to 1.87 Ga and is associated with a new rifting episode or development of a fore-trough basin. This period is characterized by the intrusion of mafic-ultramafic sills, meimechite and carbonatite deposition, and MORB-like mafic volcanism corresponding to the formation of a transitional continental-oceanic crust. # A deformation and high-grade metamorphism phase occurs in the hinterland near Kuujjuaq from 1.84 to 1.83 Ga. A regional-scale granitic and charnockitic intrusion, the De Pas Supersuite (formerly De Pas Batholith), was also emplaced during the same period and up to 1.81 Ga. This supersuite is interpreted by several authors as being associated with a Proterozoic magmatic arc environment connected to a subduction zone developed during the orogenesis. This supersuite may also be associated with a syncollisional component in the hinterland. # There would have been an oblique collision between the Superior craton and the Core Zone of the Churchill Province during the orogenesis from 1.82 to 1.77 Ga. This event resulted in transpressure-type deformation and the formation of a western-verging thrust and fold belt, now known as the Labrador Trough. Molasse-type sediments were deposited on the Superior Province margin in the third cycle during this period. # Undeformed and likely post-tectonic small intrusions of monzonite occurred in the Labrador Trough around 1.81 Ga. # The hinterland near Kuujjuaq is characterized by pegmatite intrusion and hydrothermal activity followed by a cooling period from 1.77 to 1.74 Ga.

He reported on most of the major news stories of the latter half of the 20th century and was widely regarded as one of the top American political commentators. Biography Johnson was born in New York City to journalist Malcolm Johnson and Emma Ludie (née Adams), a pianist. He earned his bachelor's degree in journalism from the University of Missouri in 1952 and his master's in American history from the University of Wisconsin in 1956. He then served in the U.S. Army as a first lieutenant in artillery during the Korean War. Johnson had begun his newspaper career earlier in Manhattan as a copy boy for The New York Sun, where his father worked. In 1956 he began reporting for the Wilmington (Delaware) News-Journal, and the following year, Johnson joined the Washington Evening Star where he worked for 12 years, variously as a reporter, copy editor, night city editor and national reporter. He covered conflicts in the Dominican Republic and India, as well as the Vietnam War. Johnson joined The Washington Post in 1969, serving first as a National correspondent, as a special assignment correspondent at home and abroad, then as the paper's Assistant Managing Editor and finally, as a national affairs columnist. Johnson in 1970 Johnson won a Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting in 1966, for his coverage of the civil rights crisis in Selma, Alabama. The award marked the first time in Pulitzer Prize history that a father and son both received awards for reporting; his father, Malcolm Johnson, won in 1949 for the New York Sun series, \\"Crime on the Waterfront,\\" which was the basis for the Academy Award-winning film, On the Waterfront. He was the author or editor of sixteen books, five of them best-sellers, including his most recent work, co-authored with Washington Post political reporter Dan Balz, The Battle for America: 2008. Johnson also was a regular commentator on the PBS television shows Washington Week in Review and The News Hour. He held academic appointments at Duke University, Princeton University, University of California at Berkeley, the University of Pennsylvania and George Washington University and served as the Knight chair of public affairs journalism at the University of Maryland from 1998 until 2013. Personal He married Julia Ann Erwin in 1954; they had five children, and later divorced. In 2002, he married Kathryn Oberly. Death On May 24, 2013, he died of a heart attack in Bethesda, Maryland. Johnson's survivors include his wife, Kathryn A. Oberly, an associate judge on the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, and three daughters and two sons from his previous marriage, to Julia Erwin. Dan Balz, senior political reporter at the Washington Post, paid tribute to Johnson's reporting skills: \\"I don't say this lightly. He was a great journalist.\\" Professor and noted former editor of The Philadelphia Inquirer and The New York Times Gene Roberts observed “He made his subjects come alive,” adding that “His writing had a flow and a polish.” Former advisor to Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, former Chicago Tribune political writer and current NBC News senior political analyst David Axelrod stated: \\"When I was a young political reporter, Haynes Johnson was one of the great, iconic journalists we all aspired to be. May he rest in peace.\\" University of Maryland President Wallace Loh said of Johnson: \\"He helped anchor a new generation of journalists.\\" Johnson was scheduled to be inducted into the Society of Professional Journalists Washington DC chapter's hall of fame in June, 2013.

A fence may be finite, or it may be formed by an infinite alternating sequence extending in both directions. The incidence posets of path graphs form examples of fences. A linear extension of a fence is called an alternating permutation; André's problem of counting the number of different linear extensions has been studied since the 19th century..

The hotel is thought to be named for the famous novel written in Medicine Bow, The Virginian by Owen Wister.http://wyomingcarboncounty.com/virginia.htm Although it provided a place for cowboys and railroad workers to stay while they were in town, the hotel was actually built to serve a much broader clientele. It became a headquarters for all to meet and eat as well as a setting for many business dealings. The significance of the hotel rests upon its architecture and its history. The building is massive in size for a town the size of Medicine Bow, which has 284 residents. The hotel has served as a landmark for the town of Medicine Bow as well as a Historic Landmark for the state of Wyoming for nearly 100 years[]. Construction and architecture The original building is a 3½ story structure built in a freely adapted example of Renaissance Revival in the Italian Style. Its simplicity of outline and symmetrical exterior lines are evidence of its Renaissance Revival architecture. It is constructed of concrete blocks containing sand drawn from the Medicine Bow River and fashioned at the building site. Along with the significance of the size and architecture of the hotel, it boasts the first electric lights and sewer in town. The hotel proper is papered in Victorian gold and burgundy medallion wallpaper, has velvet draperies and pressed tin on its 12 foot high ceilings.

Created by Julian Bleach, Anthony Cairns, Julian Crouch, Graeme Gilmour, Tamzin Griffin, Jo Pocock, Phelim McDermott, Michael Morris and The Tiger Lillies (Martyn Jacques, Adrian Huge and Adrian Stout) the production combines elements of pantomime and puppetry with musical versions of the poems with the songs generally following the text but with a somewhat darker tone. Whereas the children in the poems only sometimes die, in the musical they all do.

The website is a public resource primarily aimed at journalists and translators, students and teachers, historians and researchers in genealogy. Placenames Commission and Placenames Branch The Placenames Commission () was established by the Department of Finance in 1946 to advise Ordnance Survey Ireland and the government of what the Irish name of places should be. The Placenames Commission ceased on 11 October 2012 and the Placenames Committee () took its place on 19 September 2013. The Placenames Branch () is a branch of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, established by the Official Languages Act 2003, which supports the Placenames Commission/Committee in investigating the historical Irish-language names of places. Although both the 1922 Constitution of the Irish Free State and the current constitution adopted in 1937 make Irish the national language, the law in regard to placenames was carried over from the 19th-century UK statutes which established the Ordnance Survey and Griffith's Valuation, under which only an English-language name had official status. Irish-language names were adopted in place of some English- language names after 1920 (e.g. King's County became Laois, and Kells, County Meath became Ceannanus Mór) and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs adopted Irish names, but these were ad-hoc and sometimes inconsistent or disputed by locals or Irish-language scholars. In 1973, the Oireachtas passed an act to codify the official assignment of Irish names alongside, rather than instead of, English names; in 1975 the first statutory instrument made under the 1973 gave official Irish names to post towns. The names chosen were on the advice of the Placenames Branch; some differed from those adopted in previous decades, in some cases causing controversy. The 1973 act was replaced by the 2003 act and under its terms, the Placenames Committee continues to advise the Minister prior to the issuing of statutory instruments.

Egmond Abbey ruins, 1725 Illumination from the Egmond Gospels A statue of Lamoraal stands in the middle of the old moat and behind him the Protestant church can be seen that was built on top of the ruins of the old castle Egmond. Egmond Abbey or St. Adalbert's Abbey (, Sint-Adelbertabdij) is a Benedictine monastery of the Congregation of the Annunciation between Egmond aan den Hoef and Bakkum in Egmond-Binnen in the municipality of Bergen in the Dutch province of North Holland. Founded in 920-925 and destroyed in the Reformation, it was re- founded in 1935 as the present Sint-Adelbertabdij, in the Diocese of Haarlem. History The Benedictine abbey was founded by Dirk I, Count of Holland, in about 920-925. It was a nunnery that, according to local tradition, had been there since Saints Adalbert and Willibrord landed in 760. In about 950 work began on a stone church to replace the wooden one, as a gift from Dirk II, Count of Holland, and his wife Hildegard, to house the relics of Saint Adalbert. The consecration of the new church apparently took place in or shortly after 975, and is recorded in the Egmond Gospels, presented to the abbey by Dirk. At the same time a community of Benedictine monks from Ghent replaced the nuns, who under their abbess Erlinde, daughter of Count Dirk, were transferred to a newly established nunnery, Bennebroek Abbey. This was the oldest monastery of the Holland region. Dirk I, the founder, was buried there, as were many subsequent counts of Holland and members of their families, including Dirk II, Arnulf, Count of Holland, Dirk III, Floris I, Dirk V, and Floris II. The Count Lamoral, owner of the nearby castle, was beheaded in 1568, and this started the Dutch Revolt. Shortly afterwards, in 1573, the abbey was dissolved and laid waste just before the siege of Alkmaar on the orders of Diederik Sonoy to prevent it being used by the Spanish. The abbey's income was diverted by the stadtholder to the financing of his educational project, the newly formed Leiden University. Relationship to Egmond Castle North of the abbey is the site of Egmond Castle in Egmond aan den Hoef. The castle was built by the knight Berwout van Egmond in 1129, who was paid by the Count of Holland to represent him, protect the abbey and collect the rents, as Voogd. This was the origin of the House of Egmond. The relationship quickly turned into a power struggle between the Egmond family and the abbots that lasted for centuries. Just like the abbey, the castle was destroyed in 1573. The chapel was later restored by the Dutch Protestant church, but the castle was never rebuilt. The foundations are still visible and the land surrounding the old moat and foundations has been turned into a park. Sint-Adelbertabdij In 1933 a new Benedictine community, the Sint- Adelbertabdij, was founded on the site of the former Egmond Abbey, and was again dedicated to Saint Adalbert. The first buildings, designed by were constructed in 1935.De abdij van Egmond: herbouw ontwerp, by A.J. Krophuller, 1960 on Google books and the community was repopulated with monks (from the Benedictine abbey in Oosterhout). Buildings were refurbished and extended in the late 1940s and early 1950s; the monastery was elevated to an abbey in 1950. The farmlands were put back to use, though since 1989 however the agricultural lands have been let to a farmer since the monks were no longer able to do the heavy farmwork. A candle-making operation was started in 1945 to support the community, and later a pottery workplace was added. In 1984 the relics of Saint Adalbert were returned here, having been kept safe in Haarlem since the destruction of the previous monastery in the 16th century, and are enshrined beneath the altar. In the spring of 2003 the monks had solar panels installed which were promptly stolen two weeks later, a loss of €20,000. An online collection was held to help pay for new panels. Legacy Many artefacts from the old abbey have been recovered in the years since the 'beeldenstorm' of 1568, such as the altarpiece of 1530, and the Egmond Tympanum, a 12th-century tympanum originally set over the portal of the west front of the abbey church, which since 1842 has been preserved in the Rijksmuseum. At first it was assumed that all the abbey's possessions had been burned, but in fact they had been sold by the Protestant leader who dissolved the abbey, Diederik Sonoy, before the buildings were destroyed. In recent decades the current monastery has been able to recover many lost relics, or at least information about them. The old abbey had been of great importance to artists, and much of that art has survived, against all odds. Moreover, in the intervening period from 1568 until the remaining ruins were finally demolished in about 1800, the abbey and the associated castle ruins served as an inspiration in its damaged state to many artists who visited Bergen, Schoorl or Egmond to paint the ruins, among them Jacob van Ruisdael in 1655-60.

He spent two years, from 1936 to 1938, as a Fellow of the United States National Research Council, first at the University of Michigan and then at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark.History of MIT Spectroscopy Lab http://web.mit.edu/spectroscopy/history/lordbio.html In 1942, Lord began work at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) when the National Defense Research Committee called him to serve as a technical aide and later as deputy chief in the Committee's optics division. During the war, he was involved in the development of guided missiles as well as with military applications of infrared radiation. In 1946, MIT appointed him Director of the Spectroscopy Laboratory and in 1954, Professor of Chemistry. In collaboration with George R. Harrison, and J.R. Loofbourow, Lord published the widely used text Practical Spectroscopy in 1948. Lord is considered a pioneer in the use of infrared radiation for the study of molecular structure; he is widely recognized for developments in the interpretation of infrared spectra of molecules in terms of their vibrational motion, and also to the understanding of the cohesion of molecules by means of hydrogen bonding.

It is located about 5 miles (8 km) southwest of Valencia south of the Churchill-Roosevelt Highway and roughly 32 km from the capital city Port of Spain. History The American rights to the airfield were obtained via the Destroyers for Bases Agreement in September 1940, when the United States transferred fifty destroyers to Great Britain in exchange for Army and Navy base rights on British possessions in the Americas. In 1941, Trinidad was alarmed by a large number of Nazi U-Boats prowling off its coastline, intent on disrupting British shipping in the Caribbean Sea, and using the Vichy French controlled island of Martinique as a possible supply facility. Although the first United States Army personnel arrived on Trinidad on 24 April 1941, it was only after the United States' entry into the war, that Allied planners, in early 1942, decided to counter the Nazi threat by establishing major air and naval facilities on Trinidad. Waller Army Airfield was activated on 1 September 1941 with the assignment of the 92d Service Group. The unit's mission was to establish a flying facility within the United States Army Fort Read post. The unit consisted of the group's Headquarters, and the 92d Air Base and 309th Material Squadrons. The group was assigned to the Caribbean Air Force. Sign for Waller AFB mess hall Waller Field was named after United States Army Air Corps Major Alfred J. Waller, a distinguished World War I combat pilot, killed in the crash of a Consolidated PB-2A at Langley Field on 11 December 1937. The airfield was intended to have four runways, but the two southern ones were cancelled due to the nature of the ground. Waller was built to be the premier US combat airbase in Trinidad, but events overtook the plan. The South Atlantic Air Route to Europe quickly developed and became the most often used method of getting aircraft to the African and European theaters of war. Air Transport Command flew aircraft to Waller from South Florida airfields, then from Waller, aircraft were flown to Belem Airfield, Brazil, then across the South Atlantic Ocean to Freetown Airport, Sierra Leone and then to North Africa or England. Airfield congestion at Waller became so acute that the combat aircraft, the bombers actually confronting the U-Boats, had to be moved out to Edinburgh (Carlsen) Airfield when it was completed. With the establishment of United States bases on Trinidad and other Caribbean islands, the Nazi menace was eliminated by the action of numerous air and naval patrols. In 1943, President Roosevelt visited Waller Field on his way to the Casablanca Conference in North Africa.

It was also used as a long-range reconnaissance base by several photo-recon squadrons. Postwar use With the end of World War II Waller Airfield was reduced in scope to a skeleton staff. It was redesignated Waller Air Force Base on 26 March 1948, by the Department of the Air Force General Order Number 10. Its primary use was by Military Air Transport Service (MATS) as a transit facility under the 24th Composite Wing based at Borinquen AFB, Puerto Rico and by the MATS 6th Weather Squadron (Regional), which provided meteorological reports for aviation in the South Caribbean as well as tropical storm and hurricane reporting. President Harry S. Truman stopped at Waller Field on 31 August 1947 on his way to Brazil during a South American visit. Waller AFB was closed on 28 May 1949 due to budgetary cutbacks and MATS operations were shifted to bases in the Panama Canal Zone. After the base's closure, it became the informal home of various types of racing (using former airstrips) for over 40 years. Today construction progresses on the former airfield site of the Tamana InTech Park,http://www.tamana.com/apps/cms/info/index.aspx a science and technology park which will include amenities including real estate lots for industries as well as the new multimillion-dollar University of Trinidad and Tobago campus complex, several housing developments and other projects.

It was the Macedonian entry at the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 in Moscow, Russia, but it failed to qualify for the final round. The English version of the song is called The Sweetest Thing That Will Remain. Background Production history The song was composed by Macedonian composer and singer Jovan Jovanov together with the help of Damjan Lazarov and the lyrics were written by Elvir Mekic. After the winning the Macedonian national final, the composer of the song changed the song's arrangement making it more rock than it was at the national selection. Two more versions of the song: an English and Croatian version were produced under the names \\"The Sweetest Thing That Will Remain\\" and \\"Ne dam da te diraju\\" respectively. The lyrics of the English version are by Damjan Lazarov, while those of the Serbo- Croatian are by Elvir Mekic. It was decided that in Moscow the song will be sung in its original Macedonian. Skopje Fest 2009 The song was presented in the first semi-final on February 19 and finished first with 22 points (12 from the televote and 10 from the jury). In the final \\"Next Time\\" was performed sixth and won the competition with 19 points (12 from the televote and 7 from the jury).

His research-driven practice results in intricately handcrafted objects that reflect his exploration of music, popular culture, science, war, and American history. Early life and education Robleto was born in San Antonio, Texas, in 1972 and he received his BFA from the University of Texas at San Antonio in 1997.  Work  Robleto uses unexpected materials such as melted vinyl records, dinosaur bones, meteorites, glass produced by atomic explosions, lost heartbeat recordings from the 19th century, and he transforms these artifacts from the vast inventory of humanity’s collective past into delicately layered objects that are sincere and personal meditations on love, death, eroding memory, and healing. A self-described “materialist poet,” Robleto emphasizes the relationship between language and materials as a crucial component to his approach. “Liner notes,” usually in the form of a wall label, accompany many of the works, poetically detailing the sources embedded therein. A great appreciator of DJ culture, and a former DJ himself, Robleto considers his work a mixtape or “sampling” of humanity; he remixes forgotten stories and materials and reconstructs them into new artistic forms as a lens to view the future through the past. Increasingly, Robleto has been participating in activities outside the art world. In 2015 he was appointed Artist in Residence in Neuroaesthetics at the University of Houston's Cullen College of Engineering, and he was invited to co-organize the 2016 International Conference on Mobile Brain-Body Imaging and the Neuroscience of Art, Innovation, and Creativity., he is co-organizing year 2 of the conference in 2017. In 2015 Robleto and Contreras-Vidal coauthored a scholarly paper titled \\"Your Brain on Art: Emergent Cortical Dynamics During Aesthetic Experiences”. The study considered “the brain response to conceptual art [as] studied with mobile electroencephalography (EEG) to examine the neural basis of aesthetic experiences.” In February 2016, Robleto was coeditor of \\"Mobile Brain/Body Imaging and the Neuroscience of Art, Innovation and Creativity\\" in a special issue of the science journal Frontiers of Human Neuroscience. Robleto is currently one of six artists in the Artists-in-Residence program at the prestigious SETI Institute in Mountain View, CA, and in 2015 he joined a distinguished team of scientists as the artistic consultant on the Breakthrough Initiatives, which is the most extensive effort to find intelligent life beyond Earth to date. Specifically, Robleto will work on the Breakthrough Message project—a multi-national effort that aims to encourage intellectual and technical debate about how and what to communicate if the current search for intelligent beings beyond Earth is successful.  Teaching and Lecturing  Robleto has been a visiting artist and lecturer at many universities and institutions including Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, NY; Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA; and the Hubble Space Telescope Science Institute, Baltimore, MD. In 2013-2014 he served as the California College of the Arts Viola Frey Distinguished Visiting Professor, Oakland, CA, and in 2014-2016 he was an artist in residence at Maryland Institute College of Art. Most recently he was appointed as the first Artist- at-Large at Northwestern University's McCormick School of Engineering and Mary and Leigh Block Museum of Art, Evanston, IL. Block Museum Northwestern Artist at Large, https://www.blockmuseum.northwestern.edu/artist-projects/dario- robleto.html.  Awards, Recognitions, and Media  Awards have included the 2004 International Association of Art Critics Award for best exhibition in a commercial gallery at the national level. The exhibition was Roses in the Hospital / Men Are The New Women at Inman Gallery in 2003. In 2007 he was a recipient of the Joan Mitchell Foundation Grant and in 2009 he was a recipient of the USA Rasmuson Fellowship. Robleto has been a research fellow and resident at institutions such as the Menil Collection (2014); Rice University (2013-14); and the Smithsonian Museum of American History (2011). He served as the 2016 Texas State Artist Laureate, he currently sits on the Advisory Board at the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University and is on the Boston Institute of Contemporary Art Teen Conference Advisory Committee. Robleto has participated in many residencies including the Headlands Center for the Arts, Sausalito, CA, in 2014; and Artpace, San Antonio, TX, in 2000. In 2017 he was chosen as an Artist in Residence at the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation. His work has been profiled in numerous publications and media including Radiolab, Krista Tippet's On Being, the New York Times, and the New York Times Science Section. Robleto’s diptych The First Time, The Heart (First Pulse, Flatline), 2017 was awarded a “Prix de Print” award. The Prix de Print is a bimonthly competition, in which a single work is selected by an outside juror to be the subject of a brief essay. Robleto’s diptych recalls the method of the first sphygmograph, a technology that made its first marks in soot using a human hair as a stylus, and the data it produced to suggest the life cycle, from the first pulse to the final flat line.

A talented artist, Muñoz moved to Canada when he secured a job teaching art at the University of Montreal. While there, he began studying iconography. Iveron Icon In the summer of 1982, Muñoz went to Mount Athos, in northeastern Greece, to visit some sketes and monasteries specializing in icon painting. At the small skete of the Nativity of Christ, Muñoz felt an immediate and strong attraction to an icon of the Mother of God, a contemporary (1981) copy of the ancient and revered Panagia Portaitissa (Iveron Icon). He was disappointed to learn that it was not for sale, but to his great joy, as he was leaving the skete, Abbot Clement unexpectedly handed the icon to him, saying that it pleased the Mother of God to go with him to North America. Back in Montreal, Muñoz began reading an akathist daily before the icon. A few weeks later, on November 25, he awoke and smelled a strong fragrance. The new icon was streaked with myrrh, miraculously emanating from the hands of the Mother of God. For the next fifteen years, as myrrh continued to flow from the icon, Muñoz devoted himself to its care, accompanying it on numerous trips to parishes all over the United States, Canada, South America, Australia, and Europe. Muñoz was also faithful in fulfilling the countless requests for prayers that he received, daily commemorating scores of people, among whom were several dozen godchildren. Death Holy Trinity cemetery in Jordanville, New York In October 1997, during one of his trips with the icon, Muñoz was tortured and murdered in a hotel room in Athens, Greece during the overnight hours of October 30 or 31. The icon was stolen, and has not been seen since. Muñoz had planned to return to Canada the following day to celebrate the fifteenth anniversary of the appearance of the miraculous myrrh on the icon.

He received an SB in physics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1933. Duntley received an MS degree from California Institute of Technology in 1935 and an Sc.D. in physics from MIT in 1939. While at MIT, Duntley met and worked with Karl Taylor Compton, Harold Eugene Edgerton, and many other prominent physicists. Duntley's primary interest was in applied physics particularly the optics of turbid media.S. Q. Duntley Biography from University of California http://repositories.cdlib.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1229&context;=sio/arch He started the Visibility Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1939/40. It was the brainchild of Duntley and MIT physics chair Dr. Arthur C. Hardy. It was focused on applying optics to such problems as camouflage, misdirection of aerial bombardment, target location, visibility of submerged objects at sea. In 1952, Roger Revelle and Quimby Duntley agreed that the laboratory would become part of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, and the U.S. Navy Bureau of Ships agreed to pay for the move.History of the Scripps Visibility Lab http://www.physics.miami.edu/optics/ken/OtherPapers/A25_VA_OOXVI_2002.pdf The work of the laboratory centered on the transmission of visible light through the atmosphere and water and the related problems of image formation and recognition. The nature of much of the research required measurements of the optical properties of the ocean or atmosphere for which no instruments existed. As a result of these requirements, many unique and very specialized instruments were developed by the laboratory, many of which were based on concepts or optical designs devised by Duntley. He earned the academic rank of Professor in 1966 and taught at Scripps Institution of Oceanography and at the Department of Applied Physics and Information Science (APIS) at UCSD until his retirement. Duntley was an active member of many professional associations, particularly the Optical Society of America and Sigma Xi. He was president of the Optical Society of America in 1965.Past Presidents of the Optical Society of America http://www.osa.org/aboutosa/leadership/pastpresidents/default.aspx He was Chairman of the Representatives of the Optical Society on the U.S. National Committee of the International Commission on Illumination.

The map depicts the city’s layout with its buildings, streets, and waterways surrounded by the lakes of the basin of the Valley of Mexico and the countryside beyond. In the map one can also see images of daily life, animals and plants. It is a watercolor map that was painted between 1550 and 1556. The map gets its name from Alonso de Santa Cruz, court cartographer to Charles V (king of Spain at that time), and who for a while was considered author of the map. Since the 20th century, the map is viewed as being the work of a group of Tlahcuiloh artists at the Colegio de Santa Cruz at Tlaltelolco. This is posited because of the indigenous glyphs found on the map, its similarity to other works from the Colegio de Santa Cruz and also due to the fact that Alonso de Santa Cruz never visited New Spain. The map currently resides in the archives of the Uppsala University library and is the place where the map was rediscovered, hence the origin of the map's other title as the “Uppsala map”. Santa Cruz Map (Uppsala Map)  History  This map is believed to have been made in Mexico and sent to Alonso de Santa Cruz in Spain. After getting possession of the map Alonso de Santa Cruz included a dedicatory written in Latin for the king Carlos v and gave it to the king. After this, the exact whereabouts of the map was lost, with the only reference to it being a copy made by Alsonso de Santa Cruz in his Islario general de todas las islas del mundo. The map was rediscovered in Sweden in the Library of the University of Uppsala around the end of the 1880s.  Description  The exact identity of the material on which the map is on is disputed and there are two major views. One of the earliest scholars to comment was Francisco del Paso y Troncoso who claimed that the map consisted of two pieces of animal skin joined together, while Sigvald Linne states that the map is made up of one long strip of parchment. The map is 1.14 m long and has a width of 78 cm. The map is heavily influenced by European Renaissance landscape maps, but also has a strong indigenous influence. On the map are around 200 toponymic glyphs with only around 120 of these being exactly identified, with some glyphs being given a Nahuatl name written in the latin script. Many are not named though and at times it can be difficult to identify a glyph because of the European influence on them, which can make them look as if they were part of the landscape. On the bottom of the map towards the middle there is a Double-headed eagle and on the lower right side there is a dedicatory in Latin for the king. A portion of the dedicatory is cut off and due to the age of the map, the dedicatory has also become illegible. Orientation of the map The map is oriented so that the viewer observes the city and Valley of Mexico from the east. North, therefore, is to the left, south to the right, and west at the top of the map. Mexico City occupies the center of the map, drawn enlarged in relationship to the surrounding lakes and countryside, as befits its importance. All the buildings are drawn with their front facades facing the east, whether or not that was their actual orientation, so that they can be seen as though the viewer were standing in front of them. Major streets are indicated, such as Tecuba Street. The new cathedral of Mexico City is shown by the central plaza. Other important edifices include the Viceregal Palace, the churches associated with the Augustinian, Dominican, and Franciscan Orders, and Hernán Cortés residence. Each major building had been built utilizing European architecture and is drawn with its characteristic architectural details, such as arches, so that the viewer would have an idea of how it actually appeared. The lakes and marshes surrounding the city are represented accurately as they appeared in relation to the city; not in scale.

Designed in the saltbox style that was popularized in New England, it was originally located at 339 South Bunker Hill Avenue. In the late 19th century, Bunker Hill was one of the most prestigious neighborhoods in Los Angeles and was the site of many elegant Victorian homes. The Los Angeles Times wrote of old Bunker Hill: \\"Nowhere else in Los Angeles was the architecture so ornate. The mansions were wooden-frame Victorian with Gothic gingerbread touches applied with a heavy hand to simulate masonry.\\" Though not as elegant as many of its Victorian neighbors, the Salt Box was \\"cherished by architecture students for the simplicity of its design.\\" In the 1950s, the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency adopted a redevelopment plan for the Bunker Hill area. In the early 1960s, historic preservationists began efforts to preserve the Salt Box and another Bunker Hill mansion, known as the Castle. When the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Board was formed in August 1962, the Salt Box was one of the first structures designated as a Historic Cultural Monument (HCM #5) on the Board's first day of business. The Castle received historic designation in May 1964, becoming Historic Cultural Monument #27. For several years after the Salt Box received historic designation, efforts continued to find a way to save the structure while still making room for redevelopment. By 1968, all of the Victorian homes of Bunker Hill Avenue had been demolished, except for the Salt Box and a second home, called the Castle. In August 1968, the Los Angeles Times urban affairs editor, Ray Herbert, wrote an article indicating that the two homes were to be demolished the following month to make room for a $500 million skyscraper development. Herbert noted that plans to relocate them to a planned Heritage Park had failed: \\"The end has come for Bunker Hill's two remaining turn-of-the-century mansions.\\" Carl Mason, president of the Southern California Chapter of the American Institute of Architects said, \\"If it was just these two buildings, it wouldn't be so disturbing, but it's symptomatic of a lack of respect for our past -- of no one giving a damn about our heritage.\\" In September 1968, with demolition set for October 1, 1968, the Salt Box and the Castle were saved when the Los Angeles Recreation and Park Commission voted to move the two structures to city-owned land in Montecito Heights where the Heritage Square Museum was eventually built. Finally, in March 1969, the Salt Box and the Castle were moved to their new home in Montecito Heights to become center-pieces for the planned Heritage Square. Both structures were badly deteriorated after years of neglect, and a fundraising campaign was launched to raise money to restore the two homes. In October 1969, just seven months after the move, both structures were destroyed in a fire ignited by vandals. The Los Angeles Times reported that the two structures had been invaded by vandals and youths who used them for parties since they were relocated.

Early life Daughter of German officer Herman Joachim and French violinist Suzanne Chaigneau, and granddaughter of the violinist Joseph Joachim, she learnt violin and piano as a child. She was bilingual in German and French.Machart R. Notes to Irène Joachim recital on INA Mémoire Vive, 2000. Just before the outbreak of the First World War she and her parents left Paris for Berlin, staying in a pension in the Lutherstrasse for the remainder of the war. Her father died of tuberculosis in 1917, and due to the hardships of life in the German capital Joachim was sent back to France in the autumn of 1918, living with an aunt before her mother returned in 1920.Massin B. Les Joachim – Une famille de musiciens. Fayard, Paris, 1999. Due to health problems and her mother’s professional life-style, Joachim was educated privately, firstly by Jeanne Favart. Afternoons were devoted to music studies : violin, piano and solfège. As a child she heard musicians such as Emanuel Feuermann, Claire Croiza, Germaine Lubin, Marya Freund and the Capet Quartet. Through the social circle of Jean Gehret the 12-year-old Joachim went to plays and attended the last seasons of the Diaghilev Ballet. During the summer of 1926 and for several months in 1927 Irène accompanied her mother who undertook two visits as a teacher with the Yanker family in Chicago. This again brought the young Joachim into close contact with leading musicians, such as Thibaud, Tansman, Casals and Ravel. Back in France she stopped her violin studies but continued with the piano. She married firstly Roger Weber on 29 July 1929 and on 3 July 1930 her son Alain was born. However, she divorced Weber soon after, and suffered a period of depression and uncertainty about the direction of her life. She married secondly Jean Gehret and thirdly Jean-Louis Lévi Alvarès (great grand son of David Lévi Alvarès) film producer, in November 1955. At the instigation of Jean Gehret, in 1933 Joachim began singing lessons, with Germaine Chevalet; her progress was such that she entered the competition to enrol at the Conservatoire de Paris, joining the class of Suzanne Cesbron- Viseur in October 1935, later studying with Georges Viseur (solfège) and Pierre Chéreau. During her Conservatoire years Joachim supported herself by singing in choirs, and also sang at the Concerts du Societe du Conservatoire. Career In her final months at the Conservatoire in 1938 Joachim made her first audio recordings, of lieder by Brahms and Mozart. She would follow these during the Second World War with not only the first complete recording of Pelléas et Mélisande, but vocal music by Yves Nat and excerpts from Les Indes galantes. Joachim made her debut at the Opéra-Comique on 2 February 1939 as Nanthilde in Le Bon Roi Dagobert by Samuel-Rousseau. She then sang Micaela, Hélène (Une éducation manquée), Marguerite (Fragonard), the Countess (The Marriage of Figaro), Mélisande (Pelléas et Mélisande), the wife (Le pauvre matelot), Rosenn (Le roi d'Ys) and Sophie (Werther). She also created Léda (Amphytrion 38), Ginèvra (Ginèvra), Isabelle (Guignol), Madeleine (Marion) and Azénor (Le Rossignol de Saint-Malo).Wolff, Stéphane. Un demi-siècle d'Opéra- Comique 1900–1950.

Joachim is particularly remembered for her interpretation of Mélisande in Pelléas et MélisandeBlyth A. Pelléas et Mélisande, in Opera, Thirty all-time great recordings. Opera, London, 2002. which she first sang at the Opéra-Comique on 12 September 1940, reprising it in France and abroad up to 1952; she recorded the role in April and May 1941 under Roger Désormière. She had studied Mélisande with Georges Viseur, who had worked alongside André Messager during the opera's premiere run, and she also had several meetings in Paris with Mary Garden, who created Mélisande and who particularly helped Joachim with stage deportment for the role. Her first performance alongside Jacques Jansen as Pelléas took place at the Opéra-Comique on 20 April 1941. Joachim's fame in Pelléas et Mélisande brought about an invitation from the Propagandastaffel to sing in Berlin, which she refused. During the war years, especially from 1942 she joined other artists in the Front National; her home was used for passing messages among the group. She sang Rozenn (Le roi d'Ys) at both the Salle Favart and the Salle Garnier, as well as Mélisande in Ariane et Barbe-bleue at the Opéra.Gourret J. Dictionnaire des cantatrices de l'Opera de Paris. Editions Albatros, Paris, 1987. While her operatic career continued, the post-war years saw Joachim develop a fruitful relationship in recital with Jane Bathori; later in the 1950s, with other accompanists she made several broadcasts for French radio. She participated in the premiere of Le Soleil des eaux by Pierre Boulez as well as of works by Henri Dutilleux, Wiener and Nigg. She was renowned for her impeccable diction. Irène Joachim also sang German lieder such as Schubert, Schumann, Berg: she won a 'Grand Prix du Disque' in 1959 for her recording of lieder by Carl Maria von Weber.In 1956 Joachim’s contract at the Opera-Comique concluded, but she went on to be active in broadcasting and recitals. From 1954 to 1962 Joachim taught singing at the Schola Cantorum; from 1963 she was a professor at the Paris Conservatoire.  Recordings  As well as the classic recording of Pelléas et Mélisande, Joachim’s commercial discography includes excerpts from Ginèvra by Delannoy (title role), lieder by Berg (Grand Prix du Disque 1950), Brahms, Schumann, and Weber (Grand Prix du Disque 1959) with Hélène Boschi at the piano, art songs by Debussy (Grand Prix du Disque 1949), Gounod and Nat, as well as anthologies of songs by Les Six, and traditional French and German songs. Radio broadcasts covered another Opéra-Comique performance of Pelléas et Mélisande with Jansen, conducted by Jean Fournet (12 February 1955), plus many songs and recitals, particularly of 20th century repertoire.Nectoux, J-M, Discographie d’Irène Joachim.

Scarlett's shearwater was closely related to the fluttering shearwater (P. gavia) and Hutton's shearwater (P. huttoni), and DNA evidence from fossil bones show that all three had a common ancestor about 1 million years ago.Tennyson, A.J.D.; Shepherd, L.D.

It is an 88-foot cast iron span consisting of three lines of trusses—two outer trusses of composite cast and wrought iron in a diagonal Pratt design and a center composite bowstring truss of Pratt-system web. It was designed in 1877 by engineer Wendel Bollman (1814–1884). The center bowstring is actually a bifurcated cast iron water main. This design for a bridge carrying a water line as a component of the truss bridge support itself is a unique design element of this bridge.

It was a constitutional amendment that would have increased the annual contributions to the state's rainy day fund. The proposition was legislatively referred to voters by the State Legislature. Background In February 2009 the State Legislature narrowly passed the 2009–2010 state budget during a special session. As part of the plan to lower the state's annual deficits, the State Legislature ordered a special election with various budget reform ballot propositions, among them Proposition 1A. The proposition was part of Assembly Constitutional Amendment 1 (Third Extraordinary Session), which was authored by Republican assemblymen Roger Niello of Fair Oaks and Anthony Adams of Hesperia. The amendment passed in the State Assembly by a vote of 74 to 6 and in the State Senate by a vote of 30 to 8. Proposal Proposition 1A would have increased the target size of the state's rainy day fund from 5% to 12.5% of the General Fund (the state's chief operating fund). The proposition also established a way of determining which extra revenues to contribute to the rainy day fund (officially the Budget Stabilization Account, however Proposition 1A would have changed the name of the fund to the Budget Stabilization Fund). Extra revenues would first be used to meet constitutionally mandated education funding obligations and the remainder would be deposited in the rainy day fund. Once the target size was reached, any other revenues would have been used to pay off Economic Recovery Bonds established by Proposition 57 in 2004. Once these obligations were made any further unexpected revenues could be used on other projects. If Proposition 1B also passed, then 1.5% of revenues would be subtracted from the rainy day fund annually until $9.3 billion was paid to public education. The State Legislature passed a different bill that included tax increases with the 2009–2010 budget. That bill had a provision that stated if Proposition 1A passed, the tax increases would continue for another two years.

The screenplay by Christopher Coppola and Nick Vallelonga is based on Jack Horrigan's play Children! Children!, which ran one night on Broadway in 1972.  Plot  One evening, the Collins, Phillip and Evelyn, a married couple with two children, discover their maid, Mrs. Murdock, dead at the end of their steps; her neck is broken. Evidently, she had an accident; now they need a new babysitter for an upcoming party. The sensible Helen meets little Susan Collins at the discount market and likes her, so she offers to do the job. She does not know Susan's teenage brother Mark (Christian Slater): technically skilled and good in school, but restive and cunning. Mark also listens regularly to German marching music from the Third Reich. As soon as the parents have left, he psychologically terrorizes Helen and his sister with electronic tricks. Williams (Karl Taylor), a school jock whom Mark burned earlier in science class, comes to the Collins home out for revenge; Mark kills him with a fencing sword. Ultimately, Mark himself is killed when Helen, defending herself, knocks him onto his spiked German helmet. Mark's parents come home to find the house in shambles; Evelyn puts the blame on Helen and tries to have her arrested, unaware that Mark lies dead upstairs. Phillip has already looked in their children's rooms, presumably finding Mark's body, but instead offers Helen a ride home. Helen simply turns down the offer and drives back home herself, with Phillip refusing to have her arrested immediately and suggesting they clean up the house. Secretly, Susan dons her late brother's glasses and proceeds to listen to his Nazi music and the cycle begins anew.

She was built in 1942 as Empire Bounty for the Ministry of War Transport (MoWT). She was transferred to the Royal Fleet Auxiliary in 1946 and renamed Wave Victor with Pennant number X130. Her pennant number was later changed to A220. She served until scrapped in 1981. Description Empire Bounty was laid down at the yards of the Furness Shipbuilding Company, Haverton Hill-on-Tees on 16 November 1942. She was yard number 356. Empire Bounty was launched on 30 September 1943 and completed in February 1944. Empire Bounty was recorded on Lloyd's Register as being long, with a beam of and a depth of . She was propelled by two steam turbines driving a single screw. The turbines were made by Richardsons, Westgarth & Co Ltd, Hartlepool. Career Empire Bounty Empire Bounty entered service for the MoWT, and was operated on their behalf by the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company, of London. Her Official Number was 169126 and she used the Code Letters GCBT. Empire Bounty was a member of a number of convoys during the Second World War, mostly between Liverpool and New York. Her first crossing was with Convoy UC 14, leaving Liverpool on 1 March 1944 and arriving at New York on 11 March. She returned to America with Convoy UC 28, departing Liverpool on 1 July 1944 and arriving at New York on 12 July. Empire Bounty made one further voyage to New York that year, leaving Liverpool on 28 December and reaching her destination on 8 January 1945, having sailed via Belfast Lough. She returned to Britain with Convoy CU 54, departing New York on 19 January 1945 and reaching Liverpool on 22 January, from where she made for the Isle of Grain. Empire Bounty sailed with four more convoys before the end of the war, all between Liverpool and New York. She sailed from Liverpool with Convoy UC 54A on 28 January 1945, arriving on 9 February. Empire Bounty sailed from Milford Haven on 29 January. She returned with Convoy CU 59, departing on 19 February 1945 and arriving at Liverpool on 1 March, from where she headed to the Clyde. Two journeys back to America with convoys followed, with Convoy UC 59A between 6 March 1945 and 17 March, having sailed from Milford Haven, and with Convoy UC 66A from 2 May 1945 to 13 May. Empire Bounty put into Fayal with an unspecified defect that her master stated could only be repaired in the United Kingdom. She sailed from Fayal on 17 May and arrived at West Hartlepool on 29 May. Repairs took until 23 June to complete. Wave Victor Empire Bounty and the remaining MOWT operated tankers of her class were transferred to the Royal Fleet Auxiliary in 1946 and Empire Bounty was renamed Wave Victor. She was allocated Pennant number X130. In 1952, there was a fire on board Wave Victor whilst she was anchored off Greenock, Renfrewshire. On 17 January 1954, Wave Victor was sailing down the Bristol Channel when a fire broke out in the engine room. The fire was reported at 17:24, and five minutes later was stated to be \\"out of control\\". At 17:37 a message was broadcast by radio that the ship was to be abandoned. Several tugs and lifeboats, as well as the corvette came out to the ship, but by then the fire was raging out of control and the crew abandoned her, fearing the explosion of her bunkers. The tug Nirumand brought six firemen from Swansea to the ship, which was off Bull Point, Devon. Acting Chief Engineer George McBain remained aboard so the vessel could not be claimed by private tugs under marine salvage laws. The ship continued to drift, and after some time several of the crew and a fire fighting team re- boarded her and brought the fire under control. The fire was extinguished by 12:00 the next day. She was subsequently towed back to Swansea, and then to Wallsend on Tyne to be repaired. She was loaned to the Air Ministry in 1960, and transferred to Gan, the location of RAF Gan, as a refuelling hulk. She remained in this role until replaced in 1971 by RFA Wave Ruler, and was then laid up in Manila Bay in 1975. She was finally scrapped in 1981.

The airbase also included an emergency landing strip, \\"Tobago\\". History The American rights to the airfield were obtained via the Destroyers for Bases Agreement in September 1940 when the United States transferred fifty destroyers to Great Britain in exchange for Army and Navy base rights on British possessions in the Americas. Opened in 1942, Edinburgh Field had been intended solely as an overflow facility for Air Transport Command transport aircraft headed for nearby Waller Field, but eventually, it grew into an enormous sprawling complex with three parallel paved runways – 5000 x 150 ft / 5000 x 150 ft / 2000 x 300 ft and an Airship operating area that made it physically larger than all the other airbases in Trinidad, being used by both Army and Navy aircraft. Edinburgh Field became the principal combat base for USAAF bombers and Naval airships on Trinidad as well as Navy fighters with a complex of runways and taxiways that surpassed even Waller Field. This lasted until 3 November 1943, when it was renamed Carlsen Field. It was also used by the Royal Air Force and was defended by US Army infantry and AA units. When the Navy began lighter-than-air operations in the Caribbean in the fall of 1943, the 80th Seabees were brought in to build a station at Carlsen Field. To supplement the eight Army-owned buildings taken over by the Navy, the 80th Battalion built a large, steel blimp hangar, a mooring circle, paved runways, a helium-purification plant, and other operational appurtenances.

It was placed under the command of the 24th Composite Wing based at Borinquen AFB, Puerto Rico. In 1947 Navy C-47 operations at nearby Waller Air Force Base were moved to Carlsen. The airfield was redesignated Carlsen Air Force Base on March 26, 1948, by the Department of the Air Force General Order Number 10. Carlsen AFB was turned over to the United States Navy on 28 May 1949 and was renamed NAF (LTA) Carlsen Field. Naval units used the facility until it was formally disestablished on 10 January 1950. Today the former air and naval airship base has been turned into a dairy and agricultural area south of Chaguanas and is all but unrecognizable. Much of the former airfield area is owned by National Flour Mills and the only remnants of the base are the name of the area in south Chaguanas, along with streets named \\"Edinburgh\\" and \\"Xeres\\". The area known as Edinburgh which the runways for the base were located is now the site of a major housing development called Edinburgh 500 .

The measure was a legislatively referred constitutional amendment that would have made significant changes to the operation of the State Lottery. Background In February 2009, the State Legislature narrowly passed the 2008–2009 state budget during a special session, months after it was due. As part of the plan to lower the state's annual deficits, the State Legislature ordered a special election with various budget reform ballot propositions, among them Proposition 1C. The proposition was part of Assembly Bill 12 (Third Extraordinary Session), which was authored by Assemblywoman Noreen Evans, a Democrat from Santa Rosa. The bill passed in the State Assembly by a vote of 70 to 8 and in the State Senate by a vote of 30 to 8. Proposal Proposition 1C would have authorized borrowing against future State Lottery proceeds as a way to avoid statewide spending cuts. The 2009–2010 budget plan included $5 billion from this source, and the measure would also have authorized similar borrowing in future years. It did not include a cap on the amount of future lottery revenue that could be pledged to pay for current spending. Essentially, the measure would have allowed a form of deficit spending that would not be subject to the balanced budget provisions adopted by a vote of the people in Proposition 58. The proposal would have also repealed the requirement that State Lottery revenue be used only for education. Instead, the State Legislature could have appropriated State Lottery revenue for any purpose. However, the measure would have required the State Legislature to appropriate general fund revenues to education in an amount equivalent to the State Lottery revenues that went to schools in 2008–2009 fiscal year, adjusted for inflation and changes in student counts. It would have also revised State Lottery management details, including repealing a competitive bidding requirement for certain State Lottery operations, and lowering the cap on the amount of State Lottery revenue that can be used for administration purposes from 16% to 13% (which was the amount used for administration at the time).
