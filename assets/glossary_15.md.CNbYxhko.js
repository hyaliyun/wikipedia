During an emergency response, these criteria may be used to evaluate the severity of the event, to identify potential outcomes, and to decide what protective actions should be taken\\". PAC values are based on the following exposure limit values: * Acute Exposure Guideline Levels (AEGL) values published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) * Emergency Response Planning Guideline (ERPG) values produced by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) * Temporary Emergency Exposure Limit (TEEL) values developed by SCAPA AEGL, ERPG and TEEL benchmark values are not available for all chemicals as the clinical effects are still an active research area. Consequently, when defining PAC values the following procedure is followed. * Use AEGLs (including final or interim values) if they are available. * If AEGLs are not available, use ERPGs. * If neither AEGLs or ERPGs are available, use TEELs. There are three levels of PAC value (1 to 3) where each successive value is associated with an increasingly severe effect from a higher level of exposure. Each level is defined as follows: * PAC-1 : Mild, transient health effects. * PAC-2 : Irreversible or other serious health effects that could impair the ability to take protective action. * PAC-3 : Life-threatening health effects.

Thanks to these first experiences, Clementino has the opportunity to refine his techniques in freestyle 2004, Da Bomb 2005, Valvarap 2006 and 2theBeat 2006, beating Ensi, then defending champion in the final, who already in 2005 defeated the same Clementino. =Napolimanicomio (2006-2008)= On April 29, 2006 he released his first studio album, entitled Napolimanicomio, sung both in Italian and in Neapolitan, and in collaboration with renowned artists such as OneMic, Kiave, Francesco Paura, Spregiudicati, as well as various important local exponents such as Kapwan, Emcee O'Zi and Patto MC, achieving a moderate success and increasing his fame nationally. After the release of his first album, Clementino embarked on a series of concerts that saw him sing on more than 200 dates throughout Italy. = Videomind and I.E.N.A (2009-2011)= In late 2009 he collaborated with DJ Tayone and the rapper Francesco Paura, creating the Videomind group, with which he released the album Afterparty in 2010, whose publication is anticipated by the single Is normal, with its video clip. second single, Music Therapy, and two further video clips (L'immenso e Peter Pan). On December 19, 2011 he released his second solo album, entitled I.E.N.A., acronym for \\"I and no one else\\". This name is given by the fact that the album is a collection of songs concerning only and only himself. The disc is anticipated by the music video of La mia musica, released just over a year earlier. The name Iena (or more frequently Iena White) also derives from the alter ego of Clementino, also chosen to indicate the analogy between himself and the animal, which \\"left the carcass of the opponents on the ground\\", as stated by him in an interview. =The activity with Fabri Fibra and the collateral experiences (2012)= The activity with Fabri Fibra and the collateral experiences (2012) The same topic in detail: Rapstar and Non √® gratis. Ci rimani male / Chimica Brother comes out on January 9, 2012, single double in collaboration with the famous rapper Fabri Fibra which will precede the release of Non √® gratis, a project that sees Clementino alongside Fabri Fibra himself in the musical duo Rapstar, a partnership between the mainstream and underground hip hop. On January 20 of the same year the second video clip extracted from I.E.N.A., Toxico was released, while the third, Rovine, was extracted on March 4. From February 8 to February 12, 2012 Clementino starred in Pino Quartullo's play Che che √® √® ?, based on the 1989 film by the same name by Ettore Scola. On March 9, the single La luce is extracted from Non √® gratis, a piece totally focused on the life of Clementino, who in the passage talks about his repentances and all the mistakes made at a young age. Also on this date, the MTV channel aired the first edition of MTV Spit, a television program that will see Clementino confronting other rappers in various freestyle challenges. In the following months three further video clips are extracted from I.E.N.A .: Laughter of an I.E.N.A., Funk and TheRivati and Animals. On September 25, Clementino took part in the Hip Hop TV 4th B-Day Party, held at the Mediolanum Forum in Assago, together with the best Italian rappers. On December 7, the promo of a new song, entitled Atomic Bomb, is released, which anticipates the publication of Armageddon, an album that will see the participation of rapper Dope One and beatmaker O'Luwong. The video clip of the song was published on December 21, 2012, on the occasion of the achievement of the fateful date on which, according to some apocalyptic theories, the end of the world would have occurred.

It contains the single species Rastrimonas subtilis. It was described in 2002 from the free-living cryptomonad Chilomonas paramaecium and placed in the new genus Cryptophagus. The following year this was renamed Rastrimonas. Life cycle The life cycle begins with the adhesion of the anterior tip of the parasite, followed by the penetration of the flagellated sporozoite, into a specialized region at the base of the flagellum of an individual Chilomonas. The trophozoite grows within the host cytoplasm. After 4 to 5 successive nuclear mitoses the sporozoites bud on the surface where they acquire flagella, micronemes, and other apical structures. Mitosis is closed with an external spindle lacking a paradesmosis. A sporangium is not formed, but a cyst may occur within the host. Description The sporozoite has an elongated shape with an apical complex, a central nucleus and two flagellae which are inserted at the base of the pseudoconoid. Two microtubular roots lie deep to the plasma membrane and are attached to each basal body. The apical complex consistes of a set of 10‚Äì14 micronemes and a train of dumbbell- like vesicles which converge toward the tip of the pseudoconoid. The micronemes are outlined by a four microtubule fibre. The dumbbell-like vesicles are associated with a three microtubules in a rakelike fibre. The mitochondrial network has few cristae and a fairly reduced dense matrix. One large vacuole containing microfilamentous material is present and is connected to the nuclear envelope.

It was developed by Austrian engineer Eduard Lill in 1867. (online copy) A later paper by Lill dealt with the problem of complex roots. (online copy) Lill's method involves expressing the coefficients of a polynomial as magnitudes of segments at right angles to each other, starting from the origin, creating a path to a terminus, then finding a non-right angle path from the start to the terminus reflecting or refracting on the lines of the first path. Description of the method Finding roots of the cubic 4x3+2x2‚àí2x‚àí1 using Lill's method. Roots are ‚àí1/2, ‚àí1/, 1/. Numbers on black segments are distances (coefficients in the equation), while a number shown on a colored line is the negative of the slope and hence a real root of the polynomial. To employ the method a diagram is drawn starting at the origin. A line segment is drawn rightwards by the magnitude of the first coefficient (the coefficient of the highest-power term) (so that with a negative coefficient the segment will end left of the origin). From the end of the first segment another segment is drawn upwards by the magnitude of the second coefficient, then left by the magnitude of the third, and down by the magnitude of the fourth, and so on. The sequence of directions (not turns) is always rightward, upward, leftward, downward, then repeating itself. Thus each turn is counterclockwise. The process continues for every coefficient of the polynomial including zeroes, with negative coefficients \\"walking backwards\\". The final point reached, at the end of the segment corresponding to the equation's constant term, is the terminus. A line is then launched from the origin at some angle , reflected off of each line segment at a right angle (not necessarily the \\"natural\\" angle of reflection), and refracted at a right angle through the line through each segment (including a line for the zero coefficients) when the angled path does not hit the line segment on that line.Phillips Verner Bradford, Sc.D.. Visualizing solutions to n-th degree algebraic equations using right-angle geometric paths. The vertical and horizontal lines are reflected off or refracted through in the following sequence: the line containing the segment corresponding to the coefficient of x^{n-1}, then of x^{n-2}, etc. Choosing so that the path lands on the terminus, the negative of the tangent of is a root of this polynomial. For every real zero of the polynomial there will be one unique initial angle and path that will land on the terminus. A quadratic with two real roots, for example, will have exactly two angles that satisfy the above conditions. The construction in effect evaluates the polynomial according to Horner's method. For the polynomial a_n x^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+a_{n-2}x^{n-2}+ \\\\cdots the values of a_n x, (a_n x+a_{n-1})x, ((a_n x+a_{n-1})x+a_{n-2})x,\\\\ \\\\dots are successively generated. A solution line giving a root is similar to the Lill's construction for the polynomial with that root removed. In 1936 Margherita Piazzola Beloch showed how Lill's method could be adapted to solve cubic equations using paper folding. If simultaneous folds are allowed then any nth degree equation with a real root can be solved using n‚Äì2 simultaneous folds.

Under the mandate of Carlos III of Spain the post service became part of the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata depending of the Kingdom of Spain. With the commercial activity increasing considerably, it was decided to create a post service at Buenos Aires. Domingo Basavilbaso made the arrangements to establish a post service in the region. It would be managed by a senior lieutenant designed by the head office at Lima. On 1 July 1769, the service began its activities officially. Through the years it extended to the cities of Potos√≠ and Santiago (Chile). Bruno Ram√≠rez was the first postman of Argentine post, when the profession did not still exist in the country. Ram√≠rez officially became post employee on 14 September 1771. Years later that would be promulgated as the Day of Postman in Argentina.Efem√©ridas culturales en Argentina, Ministerio de Educaci√≥n =Evolution= Post service in Argentina played a key role during the May Revolution because of orders and reports from the Primera Junta were distributed through letters. The first manager of the service was Melchor de Alb√≠n, designed in June 1810. In 1826, during the presidency of Bernardino Rivadavia, the service was nationalised by a Law passed by the Congress of Provincias Unidas del R√≠o de la Plata. Since then, the post service was named \\"Direcci√≥n General de Correos, Postas y Caminos\\", being Juan Manuel de Luca in charge. De Luca remained during 32 years,Juan Manuel de Luca , Biblioteca Nacional being succeeded by Gervasio Antonio de Posadas. It was Posadas who placed the first post boxes in the city of Buenos Aires, apart of writing the rules for postmen and establishing lower prices for post rates. Eduardo Olivera was chosen as director in 1874 replacing Posadas. Olivera wrote the new rules and sent a project for the Law of renew of post services, n¬∞ 816. During successive administrations, money orders, courier services, registered letters and declared values were implemented. After being an agency depending of Ministries of Finances and Interior, in June 1944 the Government of Argentina established the post service autonomy, naming it \\"Direcci√≥n General de Correos y Telecomunicaciones\\" (National Direction of Post and Telecommunication) =Palacio de Correos= The palace in 2013. Post box with the logo of Correo Argentino in Buenos Aires, 2008. Due to the increasing demand for post services in Argentina, in 1888 the Post Office director, Ram√≥n C√°rcano, proposed a specific building as seat for the postal service. French architect Norbert-Auguste Maillart designed the building, inspiring in the City Hall Post Office of New York City. Works started in 1889, not being finished until 1928 when the building was officially inaugurated by president of Argentina Marcelo T. de Alvear. =ENCoTel= The \\"Empresa Nacional de Correos y Tel√©grafos\\" (ENCoTel) (in English: \\"Post and Telegraph National Company\\") was a state-owned company established in 1972 for post, telegraph and money services. During the National Reorganisation Process started in 1976, private companies were allowed to take part in post services, although the universal post services continued being managed by the state post. =Privatisation= In 1997, during the Carlos Menem's administration, ENCoTel was privatised. The service was granted in concession to \\"Correo Argentino\\", a company part of Sociedad Macri (SOCMA), owned by entrepreneur Franco Macri. In that way, Argentina became one of the first countries to privatise its post service. The contract of concession set a term of 30 years, also establishing that SOCMA would pay a six-monthly rent of A$ 51.6 million to the state. Nevertheless, the consortium built up a debt of nearly US$900 million to private creditors and the state as well.

Lightman has received several awards and honours. For example, on November 26, 2011, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and on December 4, 2010, he was elected a Corresponding Member of the International Academy of the History of Science.  Life and Works  Lightman began his career studying Victorian agnosticism amongst prominent scientific naturalists, including such figures as Thomas Henry Huxley and John Tyndall. The focus of this work was on the ways in which early agnostics did not simply see their title as a mask for atheism, but instead based it on an understanding of the epistemology of the German philosopher Immanuel Kant.Moore, James R. Review: \\"The Origins of Agnosticism: Victorian Unbelief and the Limits of Knowledge by Bernard Lightman\\", In Isis Vol. 79, No. 3, A Special Issue on Artifact and Experiment (Sept., 1988). PP. 510-511. Since 1989, Lightman's work has largely focused on the popularization of science and particularly on the role that Victorian periodicals and print culture played in shaping the form of scientific debates in the public arena. Lightman has authored, co-authored and edited several books, and has published more than 44 refereed articles and book-chapter. The John Tyndall Correspondence Project, which is an international collaborative effort to obtain, digitalize, transcribe, and publish all surviving letters to and from John Tyndall, was initiated by Lightman. He is currently working on a biography of John Tyndall and is a general editor on the project. In addition, he is the editor of a book series titled 'Science and Culture in the Nineteenth Century' published by the University of Pittsburgh Press. At York University, Lightman has been appointed to a number of administrative positions over the years, including Associate Dean of Arts, Acting Director of Academic Staff Relation, Coordinator of the interdisciplinary program Science and Society, and Director of the Graduate Program in Humanities.

George debuted on- screen on 5 September 2011. George was introduced alongside the characters Neil Cooper (Tosin Cole) and Callum Kane (Laurie Duncan); forming a new group of sixth-form college students. George is homosexual and is characterised as a \\"sharp tongued fashionista\\" with an unusual dress sense. He is best friends with Maddie Morrison (Scarlett Bowman) and Tilly Evans (Lucy Dixon), Roberts has said that George acts like their \\"lap-dog\\". However, George lacks confidence around the series' male characters. George was brought to the forefront of the series when he features in a homelessness storyline. Hollyoaks worked with the charities Centrepoint and Shelter to conduct research into the issue. Roberts said the storyline raised awareness of a taboo subject in the media. The storyline portrayed George dealing with various aspects of homelessness and offered viewers an insight to the character. He has an \\"unlikely\\" friendship with Callum and his dynamic with Phoebe Jackson (Mandip Gill) reveals that George puts up an act around others to fit in. Anthony D. Langford of AfterElton.com has praised the storyline for highlighting the issue of homeless gay teenagers, while a columnist for Soaplife has embraced George's openness about his sexuality. Roberts left his role in 2014 and George made a surprise exit in the E4 episode on 17 September 2014.http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a597287/hollyoaks- actor-steven-roberts-leaves-george-role-its-been-fabulous.html#~oQ96ZUOmGOriaq Character development =Creation and characterisation= The character was introduced as one of six new sixth-form students who arrive to study in Hollyoaks. The character was announced on 25 August 2011 with actor Steven Roberts taking the role. George was introduced alongside two other new characters Neil Cooper (Tosin Cole) and Callum Kane (Laurie Duncan). Completing the set of new students were the three previously seen characters of Maddie Morrison (Scarlett Bowman), Tilly Evans (Lucy Dixon) and Jono (Dylan Llewellyn). Roberts made his first on-screen appearance as George in the episode broadcast on 5 September 2011. George was described by in a press release as being the best friend and \\"fashionista\\" to Maddie and Tilly. George gives out fashion advice to his friends even if they do not like it. George does not have any confidence around men and despite his many \\"crushes\\" he is too afraid to act on them. Roberts told AGENT2 magazine that George is the \\"gay best friend\\" and a \\"good friend\\" who follows the girls around like \\"their lap dog\\". George \\"tells them what they want to hear and dresses them.\\" George knows a great deal about fashion, but Roberts said did not know as much and had to take a more \\"active interest\\" in fashion trends. He branded George's own attire as \\"very out there\\" because his outfits are \\"very colourful and cool\\". Roberts did not like many of his outfits because they were too colourful. He later told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that he did not mind the clothing because it is part of George's character. Roberts said that the fact George enjoys his clothes was a good quality. Will Martin of Cultbox said that George is \\"outspoken and catty\\"; which makes males \\"wary of his oozing self-confidence\\". =Squatting and homelessness= George was brought to the forefront of the series when he was featured in a storyline focusing on homelessness. Roberts told Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly that the serial's producer Emma Smithwick talked him through their plans for the storyline. He was \\"really excited\\" at the prospect of portraying \\"hard-hitting\\" issue lead story. Hollyoaks worked with the charities Centrepoint and Shelter to conduct research for the storyline. They aimed to raise awareness of homeless teenagers. Roberts was not very aware of the issue to begin with. He said that it was nice of the series to highlight a real issue that \\"you don't really see it in the papers\\". In December 2011, Smithwick told Digital Spy that she \\"loved\\" George and was excited about a storyline that the production team had planned for him. Later that month Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy revealed that George was hiding a \\"huge secret\\" and questioned how long George could keep it hidden from his friends. In January 2012, Smithwick told Inside Soap that she was finding George an interesting character and still \\"loved\\" to watch him. The storyline then began to play out on-screen and viewers discovered that George had no fixed address and had been squatting in a house. Press spoilers released on 8 January 2012 revealed that George's storyline would come to front of storylines over the weeks that followed. Mandip Gill was cast as Phoebe Jackson; a fellow squatter who lives with George. While fellow sixth- form student Callum discovers George's secret and tries to help him. Gill told TV Times that her Phoebe had been squatting for longer than George and he is not as \\"streetwise\\" as she is. As Callum is George's friend she does not trust him because she views outsiders as \\"trouble\\". Phoebe fears that she will lose George and both end up in care if Callum reports them. Gill said that \\"George and her dog Thunder are all she has\\". This causes tension between Phoebe and George and he decides to move out. Phoebe feels \\"guilty\\" because George is unwell. Gill said that George's illness forces Phoebe to put her own feeling aside to ask Callum for help. Gill said that \\"George is very ill and she knows it'd be on her conscience if anything happened to him.\\" Roberts' take on the friendship George and Phoebe share, echoed Gill's previous statement. He felt that George is inexperienced in being homeless compared to her; having only been homeless for eight months. In his backstory; George became dependent on Phoebe as his situation became desperate, while in the storyline she is his source for advice on \\"what to do and where to go\\". However, their friendship leads them into \\"quite awkward situations\\" where they act as one another's \\"lifelines\\". When George is around Phoebe he is serious and \\"down-to-earth\\", which forges a \\"brilliant\\" friendship. Roberts indicated that this was in stark contrast to his behaviour around his sixth-form friends. George creates a bravado to fit in with them and he pretends all is fine, \\"while being quite camp and outrageous\\". In one scene Callum asks George whether his parents disowned him because he is homosexual. George did not confirm the details of their estrangement. Roberts told Kilkelly that at that point, George does not feel he needs to discuss his family life because he has moved on. Roberts said that the storyline helped convey an insight to why George acts the way he does. As the storyline developed, more details surrounding George are revealed and audience was given the chance to see how George deals with the various situations of homelessness. The storyline became \\"a lot darker\\" as it became more serious. As the storyline progressed; George and Phoebe are forced to live on the streets after other squatters steal their living space. Roberts said that the squat provided George with a platform to attend college and put up a front. Now he sleeps on cardboard in the streets. Roberts said that George starts to look \\"rougher because it's cold, damp and very bleak\\". They receive help from Deena Hardman (Sian Breckin). Roberts described her as \\"very manipulative character and she hasn't got their best interests at heart\\". Storylines George arrives at Hollyoaks Sixth Form College with his friends Maddie, Tilly, Jono and Neil. George reveals he has crushes on many of the local males and offers advice to his friends. Maddie and Tilly convince George to go on a night out with Bart McQueen (Jonny Clarke), Jono and Neil while they have a girl's night. George finds it hard to bond with the guys until he manages to steal a beer pump for the local pub. He tells Maddie that she should get together with Callum. Maddie accuses George of gossiping and lying, and then refuses to include him. Tilly comforts George while he cries in the toilets. George gets a job at the Price Slice shop. George then begins stealing scraps of food from people when they are not looking. He continues to act secretive and goes to a house where he is squatting. While Maddie is away on holiday, George is paired with Callum in an assignment for General Studies. In the SU Bar, Callum convinces George to buy the drinks to improve his confidence. A group of revellers push George around because he is gay. Callum defends George by fighting the group off. After George refuses to let Callum take him home; he lets George stay at his house. Callum becomes suspicious of George's home life and follows him back to his squat. Callum tries to help George by providing him with food. Phoebe tells Callum not to trust him. Callum spends the night in the squat to find out what George lives like. George falls ill and refuses help from Callum. George chases shoplifters who attack him, he tells Callum he needs the job to survive. When he goes to stay at Callum's again, Maddie nearly catches him. George finds that his squat has been taken over and is scared away. He and Phoebe are forced to live on the streets and beg. Maddie quips George over his messy appearance, which results in him losing his temper with her. He again refuses help from Callum and accepts money from Deena Hardman (Sian Breckin). Phoebe is then attacked by a thug. Phoebe is attacked by a thug and is saved by Deena who takes Phoebe and George back to her home. Phoebe thinks that Deena has an ulterior motive, while George thinks she is being friendly. Phoebe finds a photograph of a missing boy she knows and realises that Deena is involved in human trafficking. Deena and Graham Hardman (Steve Marsh) become violent in their attempts to stop George and Phoebe escaping. George escapes and tells Callum that he thinks Phoebe did not. George later finds Phoebe's bracelet and assumes she is safe. He then agrees to stay at Callum's for a while. George struggles to get along with Lacey Kane (Georgia Bourke). Phoebe returns and tells George that Deena and Graham are watching him. Phoebe leads George to Deena, who takes him back to her house and locks him up. Phoebe tells him that she betrayed him to save her dog's life. Deena arranges for George to have sex with a man, who turns out to be an under cover police officer. Phoebe and George decide to run away from the police to avoid being sent into care. Maddie and Callum take George to see his parents. George reveals that he was bullied which eventually led to him leaving home. After he threw his old identity off a cliff, George realises that his family presumed that he killed himself. George reveals that his name is actually Andrew Palmer and returns to his parents who are shocked that he is alive. George plans to go to Jono and Ruby Button's (Anna Shaffer) wedding. Maddie steals a mini van and plans to drive them so they can elope to Gretna Green. They discover the van they have stolen has the wedding cakes from Tony Hutchinson (Nick Pickard), Cindy Cunningham (Stephanie Waring), Ste Hay (Kieron Richardson) and Doug Carter's (PJ Brennan) double wedding. George feels ill and the sight of the cake makes him feel worse so he switches seats with Neil. On their way to drop the wedding cakes off, Bart and Esther try to drive them off the road so they can stop the wedding. Maddie realises the brakes are not working and has to swerve off the road to avoid Leah Barnes (Ela-May Demirican). Maddie crashes in to the wedding venue of the double wedding and the car is upturned. Neil is killed. Maddie helps George escape and he helps her free herself. George thanks Maddie for saving his life and then realises that if he had not switches seats with Neil, Neil would not have died. The van explodes and a falling piece of debris kills Maddie. Reception For his portrayal of George, Roberts was nominated for \\"Best Actor\\" at the 2012 British Soap Awards. He was later nominated in the categories of \\"Best Actor\\" and \\"Best Newcomer\\" at the 2012 TV Choice Awards. At the 2012 Inside Soap Awards Roberts was nominated for \\"Best Newcomer\\". Anthony D. Langford of AfterElton.com admitted that he did not see George's homeless storyline coming. He said that it would be \\"interesting to see where this reality-based storyline is headed\\" because \\"there are a lot of homeless gay teens\\". Langford later said that he was intrigued by where the serial were taking the storyline. He opined that a relationship between George and Callum would be credible given the serial's history concerning homosexual characters. He described their scenes as \\"very sweet\\"; and opined that a love triangle between George, Callum and Maddie would make a \\"great story\\". Langford said it was a \\"good decision by the writers\\" to pair the two characters in a \\"topical storyline\\". He stated his surprise to his enjoyment of the storyline because initially \\"couldn‚Äôt stand\\" the character of George. Langford later criticised what he thought was the climax of the human trafficking storyline. He bemoaned the dearth of realism when George assumed Phoebe was safe because he found her bracelet. Langford also felt that Hollyoaks wanted the storyline to end quickly and branded it as a ploy to get George and Callum living together. A columnist for Soaplife defended George after he was involved in a homophobic attack in the SU Bar. They said that \\"George has made no secret of the fact he's gay to his mates, and why should he? They rightly don't care if he's gay, straight or bi.\\" They added that they were wrong to do so and branded Callum protecting George as \\"cute and courageous\\". When George is forced to live on the streets, a columnist for TV Buzz said that he was \\"lucky\\" to have Phoebe; especially after a tramp attacks them. They added that they were happy that Deena saves George, but questioned her motives for helping him. Sarah Ellis from Inside Soap said \\"George's story proved that sexual exploitation can affect anyone\\". She was also \\"relieved\\" that George managed to escape before anything \\"truly terrible\\" happened to him.

In 2007, Pumh√∂sl presented the installation and picture cycle Modernology (2007), which was exhibited at documenta 12 in Kassel, Germany. For the project, Pumh√∂sl identified and expressed in a formal vocabulary a reciprocal exchange between the German, Russian, and Japanese avant-gardes in the interwar period. Addressed in the work were artist-designer Murayama Tomoyoshi's Triangular Studio (1926) and the black walls of the \\"Der Sturm\\" exhibition in Tokyo in 1914, among others. Philosopher Juliane Rebentisch described the work as the following: \\"What may be experienced in this way is less the act of translation between the cultures than culture itself as translation...It opposes both the conservative notion of self-contained cultures as well as the neoliberal goal, currently becoming reality, of a single world culture.\\"348x348px 264x264px Pumh√∂sl staged an exhibition, 678, at Mumok in Vienna, Austria, in 2011. In this show, Pumh√∂sl presented two film installations, Expressive Rhythm and Tract, and a comprehensive cycle of images, Diminution. Expressive Rhythm refers to Alexander Rodchenko's gouache Expressive Rhythm (1942), which anticipates Jackson Pollock's style of painting and serves as a testimony to the nexus between gestural abstraction, automation, and trauma. Tract is a film hybrid between abstract animation and a dance film. Diminution, a 48-image cycle whose name refers to the repetition and diminution of a motive in musical compositional theory, addresses 'a society' of images as understood spatially, or as a kind of post-individualist score. Parallel to the exhibition, Pumh√∂sl also co-organized the re-installation of classical modern art on Level 8 of the museum with the title \\"Abstract Space\\" with curator Matthias Michalka. Michalka wrote that the exhibition \\"explor[ed] the relationship between the showing and the shown, between the title and the exhibition, inevitably result[ing] in a fundamental questioning of the conceptions of the work and the models of authorship...\\" The following year, Pumh√∂sl presented a new series at the Kunsthaus Bregenz, R√§umliche Sequenz (Spatial Sequence), specially produced for the exhibition. The works consist of plaster panels in three different sizes grouped in threes, and the order of each trio beginning with the smallest and ending with the largest format. The progression of the 45-piece series of 15 subjects, subtitled Clich√©, stems from Moholy-Nagy's enamel pictures. However, unlike Moholy-Nagy, who delegated the task of his telephone pictures to a firm, Pumh√∂sl applied the formal effects to his panel himself through a clich√© stamp. In an interview with Yilmaz Dziewior, remarking on the \\"varying relations\\" to which the pictures were hung, Pumh√∂sl remarked that the series was \\"not site but space related.\\" In 2014, Pumh√∂sl held his first solo exhibition at Miguel Abreu Gallery, in which he showed six paintings depicting formally reduced letters from the Georgian Mkhreduli alphabet and twelve paintings based on a 19th-century rabbinical map (\\"Eretz Israel,\\" from Boundaries of the Land by Rabbi Joshua Feiwel ben Israel, Grodno, 1813). In transferring the map and interpreting Georgian letterforms, Pumh√∂sl empties these systems of their use value and opens them up to other associations. In the second issue of Makhuzine, an outgrowth of the Dutch Artistic Research Event (DARE) symposium, Pumh√∂sl describes his work as the following: > In the last ten years, many arguments in the debate on Modernism have been > dominated by arguments of critique, critical distance, and critical > discourse. That widely criticized debate has become a messy discourse. My > work connects to the prevalent discourse about artistic research, as it > involves research, but for me research is only a tool leading to experience. > Experience might sound like a conservative term, but I lack a better one. To > me experience implies a process of reception and identification, of > separating and displacing elements from genealogies.\\" Solo exhibitions Solo exhibitions of Pumh√∂sl's work have been staged at Kunsthaus Bregenz (2012); Mumok (Vienna, 2011); Kunstverein f√ºr die Rheinlande und Westfalen (D√ºsseldorf, 2010); Mus√©e d‚ÄôArt Moderne Grand-Duc Jean (Luxembourg, 2009), Stedelijk Museum (Amsterdam, 2008); Neue Kunsthalle St. Gallen (2005); Centre d‚Äô√©dition contemporaine (Geneva, 2004); K√∂lnischer Kunstverein (Cologne, 2003); Secession (Vienna, 2000); and Salzburger Kunstverein (1998), among others. His work was featured in Documenta 12 (Kassel, 2007), S√£o Paulo Biennial (2006) and the 50th Venice Biennale (2003).

He is best known for his portraits of the Emperor's family and various members of the Habsburgers, including its Austrian and Spanish branches.Frans Luycx at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Life Frans Luycx was baptized on 17 April 1604 in Antwerp Cathedral. His father, Adam Luycx, was a silk cloth merchant and his mother was Johanna (or Joanna) de Rasieres. In 1618 he became a pupil in the workshop of Remakel Sina (also known as Remacules Quina). He was admitted as a master in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1620. He then joined the workshop of the leading Antwerp master Peter Paul Rubens.F. J. Van den Branden, 'Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool', 2 vols (Antwerp, 1883), pp. 804‚Äì805 Archduke Karl Joseph with puppies and cockatoo at the age of one and a half In 1635 Luycx was in Rome where he was able to establish contacts with the higher clerical circles and likely also with the Austrian branch of the House of Habsburg.Frans Luyckx, Bildnis des Kardinals Ernst Adalbert, Reichsgraf von Harrach (zu Rohrau) at Fischer Auktionen His contacts with the Imperial family may also have been facilitated by his brother Gerhard who was a courtier at the Viennese court holding the position of 'bohmischer Kammerrat'. His younger brother Antonius was a high-ranking cleric at St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna as well as the teacher of Archduchess Mariana of Austria.Ernst Ebenstein, Der Hofmaler Frans Luycx: Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte der Malerei am √∂sterreichischen Hofe in: Jahrbuch der Kunsthistorischen Sammlungen des Allerh√∂chsten Kaiserhauses (ab 1919 Jahrbuch der Kunsthistorischen Sammlungen in Wien); 26, p. 183-254 From the beginning of 1638 he became the court painter of the newly appointed emperor Ferdinand III. He was paid a handsome salary and took up residence in Vienna. Eleonora Gonzaga as Diana, Holy Empress, 3rd wife of Ferdinand III Luycx also had contacts with the court of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth monarch, W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV Vasa starting from 1637, as is confirmed in accounts preserved in Stockholm (his name being spelled as Luix). The Polish king probably visited the artist's atelier during his visit to Vienna in 1638. The 1640 settlement says about the payment by Polish agent in Vienna to \\"Leic, painter, for three effigies\\". Before 1643 Polish prince John Casimir Vasa availed himself of his services for the decoration of his residence in Nieporƒôt. Among the Polish court commissions are portraits of W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV and his wife Cecilia Renata of Austria (Wilan√≥w Palace in Warsaw, Museum of Art in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna and Alte Pinakothek in Munich)Inventory number 4197, and a portrait of King W≈Çadys≈Çaw the Elbow-high, probably one from a cycle, lost during World War II (Gem√§ldegalerie Alte Meister in Dresden). It is possible that Luycx travelled in 1640. It is believed that he was ennobled, together with his two brothers, around 1642. Luycx was referred to as 'von Luxenstein' from that time onwards. Around 1643 he is recorded as having pupils or assistants in his workshop. In that year his first wife died. The next year he married 24-year old Eleanora Claurens who was likely the mother of his three children. A first son was born in 1645. His second wife died in childbirth in 1651. Portrait of Rudolf von Colloredo In the period 1648‚Äì1650 Luycx likely travelled to the courts of the Electors to paint their portraits. In 1652 he traveled to his hometown Antwerp to obtain a certificate of legal birth and good behaviour. The next year he was back in Austria likely visiting Prague on his return trip. On 14 June 1654 Luycx married for the third time. His bride was called Eva Rosina Ottin. The couple received a wedding present from the Emperor. After the death of Emperor Ferdinand III, Luyckx was confirmed in his status as court painter. The new Emperor Leopold I, however, did not avail himself as much of Luyckx's services as the former Emperor. Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria who had returned to Austria after serving as Governor of the Spanish Netherlands from 1647 to 1656, became his patron. Luyckx accompanied the Archduke on his travels and stayed with him in Laibach after the Archduke had fallen ill from kidney stones. The artist died in his residence in Vienna on 1 May 1668. Work Frans Luycx started his career as a history painter. His early work focused on the depiction of history subjects and stories from the New Testament. In these works the influence of Rubens‚Äô history paintings is evident.Frans Luycx at the Prado site However, he abandoned these subjects soon after his first appointment as court painter.Hans J. Van Miegroet. \\"Luyckx, Frans.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 10 Oct. 2016 He established his reputation with his numerous portraits of the royal families and members of the courts of the Habsburgs, particularly in Vienna. These works played the same role as those of his compatriot and near contemporary Justus Sustermans in Florence. Unlike the latter, Luyckx was interested more in the quality of falling fabrics and draperies. His work suffered quality loss through the incessant repetition of models that became stereotypical. His Viennese court style betrays Italian and Spanish influences. His compositions display a clear relationship with the portraits by Diego Vel√°zquez. Luyckx used poses similar to those of Vel√°zquez in some of his paintings; This is evidenced in the seven portraits by his hand in the Museo del Prado.

It is located on 250 acres in Locust Grove, Georgia and houses over 1,500 animals. Many of the center's animals were rescued from unlicensed owners, donated by circuses and zoos, or surrendered by individuals who were either unable to provide the proper care or did not want them.  History  Founded by Jama and Charles Hedgecoth in 1978, the center was originally located on a small farm in Ellenwood. In 1990, Noah's Ark moved to a 122-acre property in Locust Grove, Georgia in part through the financial help of an anonymous benefactor. In 1992, they expanded the center to include the Noah's Ark Children Care Home for foster children.  Animals  In total, Noah's Ark is home to 38 animal enclosures, each of which house a variety of animals that accumulate to over 100 different species.http://www.noahs-ark.org/about-the-ark/ Inhabitants include animals such as Bengal tigers, American black bears, American mustangs, Bison, Porcupines, Sulcata tortoises, silver foxes, llamas, and ostriches. Noah's Ark is also home to a more unique bunch of animals such as Zuri the white Bengal tiger, Zipper the zonkey, Skunk the beefalo, and Grace the wolfdog hybrid. A majority of the enclosures are located to the east of the sanctuary entrance and are easily walkable along the paved trails. While visiting Noah's Ark, the experience is typically self-guided so visitors can explore at their own pace, but guided tours are available as well. Most of the animal enclosures are marked with name tags and contain information pertaining to that specific animal.  BLT  In 2001, the center acquired a trio of captive young animals (a bear cub, a lion cub, and a tiger cub) after they were confiscated from a convicted drug dealer during a raid at an Atlanta home. The three cubs were brought to Noah's Ark by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources with many health problems. When the animals were separated for treatment, the caretakers noticed a change in their behavior. The bonded cubs have been housed together in a special exhibit called \\"The Clubhouse\\" ever since. =Baloo= Baloo is a male American black bear weighing in over 800 pounds. Upon his arrival to Noah's ark, Baloo had to undergo surgery to remove the harness that he had long outgrown. The harness had become so severely ingrown to the extent that his growing body began to form around it, causing much pain. Baloo currently enjoys being in the creek that runs along his enclosure or relaxing on the porch connected to the clubhouse. He also enjoys the occasional Tootsie Pop or Oreo as those are his favorite treats. =Leo= Leo was a male African lion that weighed in at 430 pounds. Leo also suffered physically from their treatment prior to arriving at Noah's Ark. He was kept in a cage too small to accommodate his growing frame and as a result, he sustained an abrasion to the nose, leaving behind a slight scar in his later years. In late summer of 2016, caretakers noticed a change in Leo's behavior. During surgery some time later, it was found that Leo's liver had become compromised with a large amount of inoperable tumors. As a result of this discovery on August 11, Leo was put to sleep at the age of fifteen. He has been laid to rest in the trio's enclosure where a statue stands in his memory. =Shere Khan= Shere Khan was a male Bengal tiger that weighed in at 360 pounds. Like his brothers, Shere Khan arrived at Noah's Ark extremely malnourished and in need of specialized care. He healed quickly and soon grew into his role as the trio's most playful and mischievous sibling. In late 2018, Shere Khan fell ill and in early December it was reported that he was in critical condition. On December 18, he died at 17 and a half years of age as a result of failing body functions. Shere Khan has been laid to rest next to his brother, Leo.  Facilities  The sanctuary contains a welcome center, a gift shop, a playground, a picnic area, and a memorial garden.

It includes 24 extant species in six genera and three subfamilies: Peltopsinae (with one genus, Peltops), Artaminae (with one genus containing the woodswallows) and Cracticinae (currawongs, butcherbirds and the Australian magpie). Artamids used to be monotypic, containing only the woodswallows, but it was expanded to include the family Cracticidae in 1994. Some authors, however, still treat the two as separate families. Some species in this family are known for their beautiful song. Their feeding habits vary from nectar sucking (woodswallows) to predation on small birds (pied currawong).  Taxonomy and systematics  The family Artamidae was introduced by the Irish zoologist Nicholas Aylward Vigors in 1825. The artamids are part of the superfamily Malaconotoidea, a lineage which is widespread through Australasia and consists of a vast diversity of omnivorous and carnivorous songbirds. Artamids has been divided over time into two subfamilies. With few studies and dispute on the inclusion of Cracticidae within the family Artamidae, it appears they have been placed in this respective joint position due to lack of evidence or knowledge. Jerome Fuchs and colleagues extensively analysed both the mitochondrial and nuclear DNA of the Artamid family. The results suggested that the group may have existed in Australasia for 33.7 to 45 million years, dating back to the late Eocene Kurrartapu is a fossil species known from a proximal tarsometatarsus from the Early Miocene at Riversleigh in central Queensland. It was around the same size as the black butcherbird and had features in common with Strepera and Cracticus.  Distribution and habitat  Artamid species occur throughout Australasia with most species occurring in Australia and New Guinea. The social interactions of Artamids vary from the solitary black butcherbird, which lives alone or in a single pair, to the white-breasted woodswallow, which lives in flocks or loose colonies. While some species are sedentary, staying close to suburbia and ample food sources, others are migratory or even nomadic like the masked woodswallow, moving around in response to changes in climate such as rainfall or temperature. Their range of habitats varies between species but most will adapt to rainforest, woodland, coastal scrub (swallows), watercourses, playing fields, pastoral land and paperbark mangroves (butcher birds). Some species have adapted to urban landscapes where they contend with fragmented and degraded remnants of native vegetation.  Morphology  The Australian Magpie showing its plumage. Artamids are a diverse family showing a notable variation in size and shape. They range in size from the short stocky Fiji woodswallow Artamus mentalis and the Ashy woodswallow Artamus fuscus, both of which are around in length and weigh about , to the larger grey currawong Strepera versicolour, which measures up to and weighs up to . The beaks of artamids are strong and robust, sometimes known as a generalist beak. Like falcons, some of the subfamily Cracticinae possess a sharp projection along the upper mandible, with a corresponding notch on the lower mandible. This hook-like tooth is used to catch and fatally sever the bodies of insects, lizards and small mammals. A trait of artamids (and all passerines) is that it possesses an anisodactyl foot arrangement: three toes are directed forward and one toe directed backward, enabling them to perch on horizontal objects such as tree branches and power lines.Stefoff, Rebecca (2008). \\"The Bird Class\\", Marshall Cavendish Benchmark Because they possess a syrinx, Artamids, in particular the pied butcherbird, the pied currawong and the Australian magpie, are able to create subtle songs. Uniquely among other perching birds, some woodswallows possess special feathers called powder down. The tips of the barbules on powder down feathers disintegrate, forming fine particles of keratin, which appear as a powder, or \\"feather dust\\", among the feathers and spread when preening. The plumage of the Artamids is relatively dull, most birds showing a combination of greys, earthy browns, blacks and patches of white. There is seldom sexual dimorphism in plumage, but when it occurs the males are brighter and the females appear dull or resemble juveniles. In many species juveniles have a distinctly duller plumage. The notarium, a fused vertebra of the shoulder in birds that helps brace the chest against the forces generated by the wings, is a distinctive osteological trait that has evolved repeatedly in the passerines including the family Artamadae.  Behaviour  Black-faced woodswallows roosting as a group Members of the Artamidae, especially the woodswallows, have been known to cluster together during the night and day. Accounts have appeared in literature from the earliest days of ornithological documentation in Australia. The habit of clustering is believed to serve two purposes: retaining body heat during cooler weather and as a social form of camouflage. Another unusual behaviour exhibited by an Artamid is the swooping on humans by magpies. While there is not much information on this behaviour, previous studies have suggested that magpie attacks on humans may be strongly influenced by hormone levels. For example, recent investigations indicate that the stress hormone corticosterone may cause magpie aggression and swooping.  Diet and feeding  All are omnivorous to some degree: the butcherbirds mostly eat meat; Australian magpies usually forage through short grass looking for worms and other small creatures; currawongs are true omnivores, taking fruit, grain, meat, insects, eggs and nestlings and woodswallows feed on insects and nectar. Most are opportunistic feeders, such as the woodswallows, taking advantage of the flowering plants such as the silky oak Grevillea robusta, box mistletoe Amyema miquelii, and the long flowering stalks of Xanthorrhoea spp. or insects such as cockroaches or spiders eaten by the black butcherbird. Bigger species such as the grey currawong prey on many vertebrates, including frogs, lizards such as skinks, and juveniles of smaller birds such as the native eastern spinebill Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris or the introduced house sparrow Passer domesticus. The evolution of vertical feeding zones (feeding strategies subdividing into vertical space, e.g. upper, mid- and ground canopy) is noted among the Artamidae. While species will sometimes overlap vertical terrains, most woodswallows use the upper canopy, feeding on insects and pollen, while magpies and currawongs tend to use the ground or swoop down from the mid-story pouncing on their food. Being accomplished in extractive foraging is another trait of the Artamidae; although they are opportunistic feeders they are very methodical foragers, often following a set routine.  Threats  = Habitat loss = With developments occurring more regularly the most critical threat to the artamids is habitat destruction and habitat fragmentation. This loss of habitat reduces vegetation corridors (connective parcels of vegetation) that are used for feeding, breeding and safely travelling.Gill, F. (1995). Ornithology. W.H Freeman and Company, New York. . After fragmentation, habitats are often too small or are limited by the construction of roads. These barriers cause population stresses and species can become vulnerable to localised extinction. Habitat loss and fragmentation can force species into urbanised habitats that impose their own dangers such as cars. Roadkill is considered to contribute significantly to the population decline of many bird species, especially opportunistic feeders like the Artimidae, which often unconsciously swoop down on an insect without seeing an oncoming car. = Introduced species = In Australia introduced species have caused the greatest number of extinctions. Exotic feral animals such as cats can have a negative effect on Artamids. Ground-foraging species such as the magpie often fall prey to cats in urban environments.  Species  There are three subfamilies with six genera and 24 species. In 2013 a molecular study showed the Australian magpie to be the sister taxon to the black butcherbird. * Subfamily Peltopsinae: ** Genus Peltops *** Mountain peltops, Peltops montanus *** Lowland peltops, Peltops blainvillii * Subfamily Cracticinae: ** Genus Melloria *** Black butcherbird, Melloria quoyi ** Genus Gymnorhina *** Australian magpie, Gymnorhina tibicen ** Genus Cracticus *** Grey butcherbird, Cracticus torquatus *** Silver-backed butcherbird, Cracticus argenteus *** Black-backed butcherbird, Cracticus mentalis *** Pied butcherbird, Cracticus nigrogularis *** Hooded butcherbird, Cracticus cassicus *** Tagula butcherbird, Cracticus louisiadensis ** ‚Ä†Genus Kurrartapu (Early Miocene) ***K. johnnguyeni ** Genus Strepera *** Pied currawong, Strepera graculina *** Black currawong, Strepera fuliginosa *** Grey currawong, Strepera versicolor * Subfamily Artaminae: ** Genus Artamus *** Ashy woodswallow, Artamus fuscus *** Fiji woodswallow, Artamus monachus *** Ivory-backed woodswallow, Artamus monachus *** Great woodswallow, Artamus maximus *** White-breasted woodswallow, Artamus leucorynchus *** White-backed woodswallow, Artamus insignis *** Masked woodswallow, Artamus personatus *** White-browed woodswallow, Artamus superciliosus *** Black-faced woodswallow, Artamus cinereus *** Dusky woodswallow, Artamus cyanopterus *** Little woodswallow, Artamus minor  References  Category:Bird families Category:Australasian realm fauna Category:Indomalayan realm fauna Category:Passeri ","title":"Artamidae"},{"id":"34589955","text":"Henry Christmas Henry Christmas (1811 ‚Äì March 10, 1868), at the end of his life going by the surname Noel-Fearn, was an English clergyman, a man of letters and editor of periodicals, known also as a numismatist.

It was a focal point of Iraqi insurgency, which erupted into open armed conflict in 2004 and in 2006, part of the Iraq War in Anbar Province. Operation Murfreesboro was a U.S. offensive in February 2007 intended to cut off the Ma'Laab district of eastern Ramadi from the rest of the town in order to drive out Zarqawi's Al-Qaeda in Iraq. To the north and west, Ramadi is bounded by the Euphrates River, while to the east and south it gradually disappears into suburbs. Ramadi is also the location of the Ramadi Barrage which diverts water from the Euphrates River into Lake Habbaniyah. U.S. units were largely restricted to a handful of small bases. The headquarters base, in the northern corner of Ramadi, is on the grounds of one of two Saddam-era palaces in the city; known first as Tactical Assembly Area Rifles and later as Camp Blue Diamond, this base was turned over to the Iraqi Army in the winter of 2007. At the other end of the stretch of Highway 10 that runs through Ramadi is another Saddam-era palace used as a Combat Outpost by a unit from the Florida National Guard. Several smaller buildings along Highway 10 between the two larger bases are routinely occupied by U.S. and Iraqi units, and just outside the city there are a number of other, less dangerous and better equipped camps, where an Army brigade headquarters and its support units were based. March‚ÄìJuly 2003 The 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment was the first American military unit to reach Ramadi, arriving in early May 2003. The 3rd ACR's headquarters was located at the Rifles Base, which by July had hundreds of laborers from around the world working around the clock to construct a dining hall and recreation area for American forces. Other American units initially stationed in Ramadi were: *Company C, 2nd Battalion, 325th Airborne Infantry Regiment, which utilized the former presidential palace in Ramadi as its headquarters and faced repeated mortar attacks. *Bravo Company, 1st Battalion, 124th Infantry Regiment, Florida National Guard: Initially based downtown at a government building nicknamed \\"the Mayor's Cell,\\" they were forced to move by a June 2003 local protest. Bravo Company thus relocated to a sandstone palace at the edge of the city. *Bravo Company, 122nd Engineer Battalion, South Carolina National Guard: Also utilized the former presidential palace complex. *Delta Detachment, 502d Personnel Services Battalion (attached to 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment, both at that time out of Fort Carson, Colorado), provided human resources support to the Regiment while headquartered out of Ramadi. thumbright225px * City of Ramadi * 212th Brigade 2/5th Field Artillery Ft.Sill Oklahoma was in charge of Heavy Artillery support for 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment.

February 2004 ‚Äì April 2005 1BCT 1ID Soldiers during OIF 2 U.S. Marines check vehicles at a checkpoint, Ramadi, 20 February 2005 U.S. Marines prepare to conduct house calls in Ramadi, 18 February 2005 The 3rd ACR departed Ramadi in September 2003, handing it over to the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division (1st BCT, 1st ID) of Fort Riley, Kansas; however, until March, the 1st BCT fell under the command of the 82nd Airborne Division. In March, the 1st Marine Division deployed to Anbar, replacing the 82nd. While Army units in Iraq complete year-long tours, Marine units stay for seven months; in Ramadi, one Marine battalion typically augments an Army brigade. During the first half of 2004, 1st BCT's two battalions (1‚Äì16th Infantry, 1‚Äì34th Armor) were augmented by the 2nd Battalion 4th Marines (2/4) and 3rd Battalion 11th Marines (3/11). When 2/4 and 3/11 left in September and October, they handed their sector of Ramadi over to the 2nd Battalion 5th Marines (2/5)2nd Battalion 11th marines were also deployed during this time to Ar Ramadi, who completed their tour in April 2005, then 1st Battalion 5th Marines (1/5) took over. The spring of 2004 was particularly bloody in Ramadi. In the opening days of the rebellion that began in April 2004, and which was dominated by the siege of Fallujah, 2/4 suffered one of the deadliest attacks of the war, losing 12 Marines in a single day, April 6, 2004. During this time, with most of the 1st Marine Division's resources focused on Fallujah, 2nd Battalion 4th Marines (2/4) and 3rd Battalion 11th Marines (3/11) were left with the burden of controlling Ramadi. For the most part, the four battalions occupying the Ramadi-Fallujah corridor (including the insurgent den of Khaldiyah) hunkered down and defended what ground they already held along the city's central thoroughfare. The remainder of the month was also costly for insurgent groups: between 800 and 1000 were killed in running battles with the Marines, and the 1‚Äì16 Infantry. April 2005 ‚Äì April 2006 Marine and Army units in Ramadi rotate on overlapping schedules; thus, just as 1 BCT 1ID arrived well before the 1st Marine Division officially began OIF 2, so the 2nd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division (2-2 ID) arrived in August 2004, while the 1st Marine Division was still in charge of Anbar. Working first with the Marines from 2/5 and later with their replacements, 1/5 (who in turn were replaced by the 3rd Battalion 7th Marines (3/7)), the 2-2 ID's five battalions (the 1‚Äì9th Infantry, 2‚Äì17th Field Artillery, 1‚Äì503rd Infantry, 44th Engineer Battalion, and 1‚Äì506th Infantry augment by 28 ID 876th En Bn Combat Engineer Platoon) continued the previous units' work until August 2005. In August 2005, a Provisional Infantry Battalion made up of Artillery Marines from 2nd Battalion, 10th Marines & Lima Battery, 3rd Battalion, 10th Marines, took over base security, SASO (Security And Stability Operations) & Force Protection Operations for Camp Blue Diamond in Ramadi, while also conducting continuous Combat Patrols & House-to-House Searches within the Camps surrounding AO in the Northern part of the City to disrupt enemy activity & recover weapon caches. Squads from 2/10 would also rotate on a regular basis to help support Marine Units tasked with defending al Anbar's Provincial Government Center located within the heart of Downtown Ramadi, a high priority target for the enemy. Convoy Security during transportation of currency & VIP'S to & from the site was also provided by 2/10 Marines. 2/10 was relieved in February 2006 & turned over control to the Army's 1st Battalion, 35th Armor (Task force Conqueror). Eventually, the Iraqi Army's 7th Infantry Division would officially take control of Camp Blue Diamond on May 9, 2006. During this period the brigade and the Marine battalions that worked with it continued to suffer steady casualties. Unlike the mechanized 1BCT 1ID, 2-2 ID was mostly a light-infantry brigade (1‚Äì9 Infantry is a mechanized infantry battalion), whose only tanks came from one company (Death Dealer Company) of the 2‚Äì72nd Armor. The 2‚Äì28th BCT was reinforced further in July, with the 2‚Äì69th Armor HHC Co., Able Co.and Delta Co, a combat-experienced 3rd Infantry Division unit, being sent to it from Baqubah. The 2‚Äì69th Armor remained in Ramadi until January. During September 2005, the 2‚Äì28th BCT suffered casualties as insurgent groups were pushed downriver by Marine offensives near Al Qaim and in the area around Haditha. Marine and 3rd Infantry division units that replaced the 503rd and 1/5 were doing the majority of rigorous counter-insurgency in the City center Among the Army Combat Support units in Ramadi during this period were 2nd Platoon, 2nd Military Police Company as well as HHC and B Company, 983rd Engineer Combat Battalion (Heavy), and US Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 5, who greatly improved quality of life and force protection at American and Iraqi camps, as well as providing security and support for the first democratic elections and the subsequently elected government in Ramadi. The 224th Combat Engineer Battalion (Iowa Army National Guard) served as the Divisional Engineer Battalion, conducting route clearance operations in support of first the 1st Marine Division from January ‚Äì March 2005, and then to the 2nd Marine Division from March ‚Äì December 2005, when it was replaced by the 54th Engineer Battalion, a component of the 130th Engineer Brigade, V Corps based in Germany. The 54th remained in Ramadi until October 2006 and suffered six fatalities. April‚ÄìMay 2006 2-2 ID was replaced by the Pennsylvania National Guard's 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 28th Infantry Division (2‚Äì28th BCT). When it arrived in August 2005 beside the Marines of 3/7, the 2‚Äì28th BCT came equipped for heavy fighting; it brought six battalions rather than three (3‚Äì103rd Armor, 1‚Äì104th Cavalry, 1‚Äì109th Infantry, 1‚Äì110th Infantry, 1‚Äì172nd Armor) (actually made up of one company of Mountain Infantry and a single company of tanks) and 876 Engineer Battalion, all of which were \\"heavy\\" units equipped with tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles, and were filled in with Troop A 1‚Äì167 Cavalry of the Nebraska Army National Guard for their Brigade Quick Reaction Force (QRF) and Personal Security Detail (PSD) units. The 1‚Äì167th Cavalry also provided local security for EOD units during counter-IED operations. The 2‚Äì222nd FA from the Utah Army National Guard provided counterfire, base defense and route security as well, firing over 4,000 rounds of artillery during the one-year tour. They were the first National Guard unit to fire the Paladin weapon system in combat operations. . During September 2005, the 2‚Äì28th BCT suffered casualties as insurgent groups were pushed downriver by Marine offensives near Al Qaim and in the area around Haditha. Marine and 3rd Infantry division units that replaced the 503rd and 1/5 were doing the majority of rigorous counter-insurgency in the City center. A smoke plume caused by an insurgent attack on the government center in downtown Ramadi, 13 March 2006 In March 2006, as 3rd Battalion 8th Marines arrived to replace 3/7, violence again began to escalate in Ramadi, with U.S. casualties spiking. With the 2‚Äì69th gone, the 2‚Äì28th BCT was again reinforced to help damp the insurgent activity. This time by the 1‚Äì506th Infantry, who arrived in December 2005 as a unit of the 101st Airborne Division that was transferred to Ramadi from Baghdad's Sadr City. During March 2006 two soldiers from the 75th Ranger Regiment were killed in Ramadi, possibly indicating that elements of the secretive Task Force 145 (which later helped to kill Abu Musab al-Zarqawi) were present in the city. Additionally, at least 200 insurgents were killed by Army Ranger and 101st Airborne units during the month of April. June‚ÄìNovember 2006 U.S. Army soldiers and Iraqi Security Forces in Ramadi, 10 August 2006 As the summer of 2006 arrived, the level of attacks in Ramadi remained the highest in the country. As a result, rumors of an impending Fallujah-style assault sprang up in the Arab media. In early June 2006, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 28th Infantry Division completed its year long deployment and the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division was shifted from Tal Afar in northern Iraq to replace them. 2nd Battalion, 37th Armored Regiment remained in Tal Afar. To reinforce the 1st BCT, 1st Armored Division, General Casey ordered the deployment of two of his three strategic reserve battalions from the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division (the 1‚Äì6th Infantry and 1‚Äì35th Armor, along with A & C Companies of the 40th Engineer Battalion.) On June 18, 2006, the 1st BCT, 1st Armored Division launched its offensive. Despite fears that the assault would be a repeat of the Marine offensive in Fallujah, the brigade took a different approach, discouraging residents from fleeing and moving in slowly with much more limited use of heavy weapons such as Abrams tanks, artillery, and close air support. As the offensive opened, two columns of U.S. mechanized troops pushed north into the city's suburbs with Iraqi Army units, cutting off two major entrances to the city for the first time during the war. Meanwhile, 3rd Battalion 8th Marines held onto the western half of the downtown area and patrolled the river and its two bridges (the only northbound exits from the city) on foot and in boats; The 1‚Äì506th Infantry, 1‚Äì6th Infantry, 1‚Äì35th Armor and 40th Engineers continued to hold the main thoroughfare and the eastern exits. As the operation began, there was controversy over the number of refugees who left the city despite the U.S. military's assurances that the offensive would be of a very different character than the Fallujah assault of 2004. 1st BCT, 1st AD and elements of the 2nd BCT, 1st AD proceeded to establish a series of mutually supporting Combat Outposts manned by US and Iraqi forces both inside and outside the city. These outposts put increasing pressure on Al Qaeda and other insurgent groups operating throughout the city. US Forces along with their Iraqi Army counterparts brought the fight to Al Qaeda by conducting operations directly from these outposts and providing watch and security over key supply routes throughout the city. According to Colonel MacFarland, \\"These [COPs] have had a very disruptive effect on the enemy. Most importantly, though, it's given us the opportunity to engage the people of Ramadi. ... And we've established real relationships with the people in parts of the city that we hadn't been able to in the past\\". Throughout July, insurgents operating in multiple platoon strength units consistently attacked the Combat Outposts with small arms, RPG, and indirect fire as US troops established additional COPs deeper into Ramadi neighborhoods. These attacks culminated in a citywide battle on July 24 during which insurgents suffered heavy casualties after being beaten back.http://usacac.army.mil/CAC/milreview/English/MarApr08/Smith_AnbarEngMarApr08.pdf In mid September 2006, 1st Battalion 6th Marines took over the AO of Downtown Ramadi. The Battalion conducted several crucial missions along with the security and construction of numerous security stations throughout the downtown area. This was a crucial step in the deterring of IED attacks, IRL attacks and increasing the ability to conduct patrols in the Sook and NE corner of their AO. 1/6's progress and continuous pressure began to force out the city's insurgents and allowed the formation of a current and functional Iraqi Police force and Iraqi National Guard unit. 1st Battalion 6th Marines was extended in the 2006/2007 surge of 30,000 troops to the Al Anbar province. This allowed the battalion to continue to regulate and patrol the once \\"deadliest city in the world\\" and allow other Iraqi cities to begin the movement towards stability and away from insurgency. December 2006 ‚Äì December 2007 Captured insurgents (December 2006). Camp Ramadi, 15 November 2009 After the first 2004 tour in Ramadi, 503rd Infantry Regiment, reflagged to 1‚Äì9 Infantry, deployed back to Ramadi in October 2006. In the beginning months of 2007, 1st Battalion 9th Infantry Regiment of the 2nd Infantry Division, with support from 3rd Battalion, 69th Armor Regiment of the 3rd Infantry Division, Bravo Company of the 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment of the 1st Infantry Division(The Blue Spaders), Navy SEALs Navy ESF and 1/1/1 Iraqi Army with Route clearance operations being conducted by TF Pathfinder 321st EN BN Sept 2006 ‚Äì Sept 2007 for Ramadi, Fallujah up Al Assad to the Syria Border], launched an offensive in East Ramadi, Operation Murfreesboro. The operation was intended to cut off the Ma'Laab district from the rest of Ramadi in order to drive out the AQIZ. In February 2007, the operation had successfully divided the district by setting up a concrete wall barrier. There were more than 40 engagements, 8 large weapons caches found, about 55 IEDs exploded or found, 70 insurgents killed, 10 wounded, and 32 detained. The success of this operation led to the forming of the Ramadi Police Force which worked alongside U.S. military and Iraqi Army. 1‚Äì9 Infantry worked with the head sheikh in the Sofia district and secured valuable intelligence throughout their campaign in Ramadi.

The report recommended that the best option for Nassau County was to negotiate with the MTA to continue with the current service, with a more equitable subsidy. The MTA should first decrease the LIBS operating expense by about 4%, so that no increase in subsidies is required for 2011 by either the MTA or the County.

Discovery Rotaryus is known only from the holotype MNG 10182, articulated partial well-preserved skull and both mandibles and a closely associated partial postcranial skeleton. The postcranial skeleton includes several articulated neural arches with ribs, most of the left shoulder girdle, humeri, right radius and ulna, and a femur. It was collected from the uppermost part of the Tambach Formation, dating to the Artinskian stage of the Late Cisuralian Series (or alternatively upper Rotliegend), about 284-279.5 million years ago. It was found in the lowermost formational unit of the Upper Rotliegend Group or Series of the Bromacker Quarry, the middle part of the Thuringian Forest, near the village of Tambach-Dietharz. Rotaryus is only the second trematopid species to be reported from the Bromacker locality, and outside of United States, alongside Tambachia. Phylogeny Rotaryus is characterized by a unique combination of characters, including the two following autapomorphies: \\"entire length of nasolacrimal canal exposed as a smooth, uniform channel in which the anterior half coincides with the maxillary-lacrimal suture; and parasphenoid plate has an outline of an isosceles triangle, with the shorter, equal-length lateral margins converging on the cultriform process.\\" The following cladogram shows the phylogenetic position of Rotaryus, from Berman et al., 2011. Etymology Rotaryus was first named by David S. Berman, Amy C. Henrici, Thomas Martens, Stuart S. Sumida and Jason S. Anderson in 2011 and the type species is Rotaryus gothae. Both the generic name and the specific name honor the Rotary Club of Gotha, Germany, for supporting financially the excavations and the Bromacker locality project.

Wilbur Gingrich as an editor of the Bauer Lexicon starting in 1957 until the publication of the second edition in 1979, and as the only editor from 1979 until the publication of the 3rd edition, updating it with the results of modern scholarship, converting it to SGML to allow it to be easily published in electronic formats, and significantly improving the usability of the lexicon, as well as the typography. Earlier English-language editions of the Bauer Lexicon were essentially translations and adaptations of Walter Bauer's German dictionary into English. Danker‚Äôs dictionary was essentially an entirely new work. He reportedly worked on the lexicon 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, for 10 years. Career Professor Danker received his formal training at Concordia Seminary, where he satisfied requirements for a B.D. degree with a dissertation on the function of the Hebrew word ◊î÷∂◊ë÷∂◊ú (hebel) within the book of Qoheleth. He then undertook his PhD studies at the University of Chicago, Department of Humanities, in classical studies, with special interest in Homer, Pindar, and the Greek tragedians, finally writing a dissertation on \\"Threnetic Penetration in Aeschylus and Sophocles\\". From 1954 on, Danker taught at the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod's Concordia Seminary in St. Louis, when he joined the team of Arndt and Gingrich and helped produce the second edition of BAG, then called BAGD. In 1974, he left with the majority of faculty members to form Concordia Seminary in Exile, also known as Seminex. On the voluntary dissolution of Seminex in 1983, Danker chose to go to the Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago, where he taught until his retirement in 1988. He then began his magisterial work on the BDAG, upon which completion the lexicon was finally released in 2000. Having already produced BDAG (3rd ed) during his so-called \\"retirement\\", he spent his last years preparing The Concise Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament which is not a condensation of BDAG but an entirely new, although shorter, lexicon of the New Testament. Awards and recognition In 2004, a festschrift with the title Biblical Greek Language and Lexicography: Essays in Honor of Frederick W. Danker () was published to celebrate Danker's work, including 18 essays on biblical Greek language and lexicography. Personal reflection \\"In a personal interview I conducted with him in January, 2003, I asked Prof Danker about his own education at Concordia Seminary, where William Arndt was his professor. He told me of a course where they translated the entire NT in two semesters! He described also his Ph.D. in Classics at the University of Chicago and his return to teach at Concordia, where he stayed until the seminary divided in the seventies when he went to Seminex and then to the Lutheran School of Theology in Chicago. I asked Professor Danker if he could confirm the rumor circulating about him ‚Äúon the street.‚Äù That of course his interest, and he responded: ‚ÄúOh, what is that?‚Äù I told him that there was a rumor that he had worked continuously on the 3rd edition of the lexicon for twelve hours each day, six days a week, for ten years. I should not have been surprised that his humble response was simply, ‚ÄúWell, we did take vacations.\\" It is a memory that I will always cherish and I tell my students about it often. He also whispered to me that he had another project in the works. When his 400-page Concise Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament appeared in 2009, I recalled that ‚Äúcan you keep a secret?‚Äù remark! Frederick W Danker was a pains-taking scholar, the likes of which the Christian world has rarely seen. But I close with something else that I learned about the man that day. He apologized that he had to end the interview because he wanted to pay a pastoral visit in the hospital to an ailing colleague.\\" (William Varner) Frederick W. Danker Depositorium The Frederick W. Danker Depositorium is located within the Overton Memorial Library on the campus of Heritage Christian University in Florence, Alabama. In April 2010, Danker informed the staff of the Overton Memorial Library that he would be giving his entire personal library and papers to OML. The process officially began in October 2010 and continued until shortly after his death in February 2012. Housed within the Danker Depositorium are files of research conducted by Danker, personal correspondence, published and unpublished writings by Danker. and memorabilia from his home and office.

Examples Nuclear LIM interactor (NLI) / LIM domain-binding protein 1 (LDB1) is located in the nuclei of neuronal cells during development, it is co-expressed with ISL1 in early motor neuron differentiation and has a suggested role in the ISL1 dependent development of motor neurons. It is suggested that these proteins act synergistically to enhance transcriptional efficiency by acting as co-factors for LIM homeodomain and Otx class transcription factors both of which have essential roles in development. The Drosophila melanogaster protein Chip is required for segmentation and activity of a remote wing margin enhancer. Chip is a ubiquitous chromosomal factor required for normal expression of diverse genes at many stages of development. It is suggested that Chip cooperates with different LIM domain proteins and other factors to structurally support remote enhancer-promoter interactions.

His 2010 release \\"Sunshine\\" was followed by his debut EP, Families in 2011 on the Young Turks label. Talabot released his debut album ∆íIN in January 2012 on Permanent Vacation. The record was generally well received with critics, receiving a 5 star review from The Guardian. Despite not releasing a solo album since ∆íIN, Talabot has released music consistently including remixes of artists from The XX to Sfire to Shit Robot. In social media posts Talabot has hinted that work is ongoing for his second LP. The Hivern label was founded by Riverola in 2008, the name coming from the Catalan word for \\"winter\\". The label has released work from artists including Pional, Marvin & Guy, Margot and John Talabot himself. Consistent releases on the label as well as showcase events around Europe have helped establish Hivern as an influential body on the European electronic music scene. Talabot's 2016 release \\"Voices\\" was used as part of Chanel's promotional content for the fashion house's Spring-Summer 2017 Haute Couture collection. =Live Performances= Following the success of the ∆íIN album Riverola established himself on the international DJ circuit. This was helped by a 2012 tour with The xx in North America which allowed him to reach a wider audience. In 2017 Talabot performed several shows with Axel Boman as Talaboman including a headline show at the Primavera festival in Barcelona. =Side projects= John Talabot has been involved in a number of side projects teaming up with Mark Pi√±ol under the name \\"Quentin\\", with long time collaborator Pional as \\"Lost Scripts\\", with other members of the Hivern Label as \\"Parple\\" and most notably with Swedish producer Axel Boman for \\"Talaboman\\". The latter originating from a track, \\"Sideral\\" the two produced for Talabot's 2014 DJ Kicks mix. This was followed with a double EP/LP \\"The Night Land\\" which was released in March 2017.

The technique basically involves specifying a null hypothesis H_0 describing a linear process and then generating several surrogate data sets according to H_0 using Monte Carlo methods. A discriminating statistic is then calculated for the original time series and all the surrogate set. If the value of the statistic is significantly different for the original series than for the surrogate set, the null hypothesis is rejected and non-linearity assumed. The particular surrogate data testing method to be used is directly related to the null hypothesis. Usually this is similar to the following: The data is a realization of a stationary linear system, whose output has been possibly measured by a monotonically increasing possibly nonlinear (but static) function. Here linear means that each value is linearly dependent on past values or on present and past values of some independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) process, usually also Gaussian. This is equivalent to saying that the process is ARMA type. In case of fluxes (continuous mappings), linearity of system means that it can be expressed by a linear differential equation. In this hypothesis, the static measurement function is one which depends only on the present value of its argument, not on past ones.  Methods  Many algorithms to generate surrogate data have been proposed. They are usually classified in two groups: * Typical realizations: data series are generated as outputs of a well-fitted model to the original data. * Constrained realizations: data series are created directly from original data, generally by some suitable transformation of it. The last surrogate data methods do not depend on a particular model, nor on any parameters, thus they are non-parametric methods. These surrogate data methods are usually based on preserving the linear structure of the original series (for instance, by preserving the autocorrelation function, or equivalently the periodogram, an estimate of the sample spectrum). Among constrained realizations methods, the most widely used (and thus could be called the classical methods) are: # Algorithm 0, or RS (for Random Shuffle): New data are created simply by random permutations of the original series. The permutations guarantee the same amplitude distribution than the original series, but destroy any linear correlation. This method is associated to the null hypothesis of the data being uncorrelated noise (possibly Gaussian and measured by a static nonlinear function). # Algorithm 1, or RP (for Random Phases; also known as FT, for Fourier Transform): In order to preserve the linear correlation (the periodogram) of the series, surrogate data are created by the inverse Fourier Transform of the modules of Fourier Transform of the original data with new (uniformly random) phases. If the surrogates must be real, the Fourier phases must be antisymmetric with respect to the central value of data. # Algorithm 2, or AAFT (for Amplitude Adjusted Fourier Transform): This method has approximately the advantages of the two previous ones: it tries to preserve both the linear structure and the amplitude distribution. This method consists of these steps: #* Scaling the data to a Gaussian distribution (Gaussianization). #* Performing a RP transformation of the new data. #* Finally doing a transformation inverse of the first one (de-Gaussianization). #:The drawback of this method is precisely that the last step changes somewhat the linear structure. # Iterative algorithm 2, or IAAFT (for Iterative Amplitude Adjusted Fourier Transform): This algorithm is an iterative version of AAFT. The steps are repeated until the autocorrelation function is sufficiently similar to the original, or until there is no change in the amplitudes. Many other surrogate data methods have been proposed, some based on optimizations to achieve an autocorrelation close to the original one, some based on wavelet transform and some capable of dealing with some types of non- stationary data.

The airport is operated by Kempsey Shire Council.  History  18 October 1930: The Department of Defense approved the site at Aldavilla on the Sherwood Road for development of an aerodrome for all types of present aircraft. When the work is finished, the department will issue an official aerodrome license. The department has advised the Kempsey Municipal Council (which has been in the forefront of this matter) to acquire rights to adjoining properties to provide for future expansion when larger aircraft come to Australia. 7 December 1936: The Aldavilla aerodrome was officially opened on Saturday by the minister of defense the Hon H. V. C. Thorby. An aerial pageant was held during the day on the all over grassed aerodrome. 1 June 1953: - New ‚Äôdrome opened The newly constructed Kempsey aerodrome was officially opened on Saturday by the Minister for Civil Aviation (Mr. H. L. Anthony). The ‚Äòdrome cost ¬£160,000 to construct, the breakdown being: 44 degree runway ¬£69,000; landing strip and sealing at either end ¬£25,000; apron and taxi-ways ¬£5,000; area roads around the aerodrome ¬£2,500; car park and access roads ¬£3,000; passenger facilities (yet to be built) ¬£1,500. The opening of the aerodrome was the first of the Coronation celebrations in the district. It was followed by a spectacular aerial pageant which drew a crowd of over 2000. Among those at the ceremony was a former mayor of Kempsey, Mr. Sam Lacey, now of Sydney. Some 20 years ago he took two departmental officers to Aldavilla to make a survey of the ‚Äòdrome site. Also present was Mr. A. J. Druitt, former town clerk (and an alert 88) who arranged for the resumption of the land. Air Service 1 July 1953: Butler Air Transport Ltd has recommenced its air service between Kempsey and Sydney. It landed a four-engine De Haviland Heron passenger plane on Kempsey aerodrome about 9.15am yesterday with 13 passengers aboard. 1958/59: Kempsey airport had a major upgrading with the existing gravel landing area being converted to an all weather bitumen strip. Kempsey airport was then on a par with all regional airports throughout Australia. 1 July 1975: Kempsey airport was taken over by the Macleay River County Council from the Commonwealth Government. 12 May 1984: It was announced that Kempsey airport would get navigational aids allowing night landings. Landing lights at the airport have been in operation for some years. 1986: Kempsey airport became fully operational for night flying in 1986. 1 September 1993: FBO/MRO Macleay Aircraft Maintenance commenced operation from Kempsey Airport 1 October 2016: Wings Over Macleay is the first 2-day event of its kind for the Kempsey-Macleay area.

Intelligent design (ID) is presented by its proponents as science and claims to offer an alternative to evolution. The Discovery Institute, a politically conservative think tank and the leading proponent of intelligent design, launched a campaign entitled \\"Teach the Controversy\\" which claims that a controversy exists within the scientific community over evolution. The scientific community, however, rejects intelligent design as a form of creationism. The basic facts of evolution are not a matter of controversy in science. \\"Teach the Controversy\\" The intelligent design movement states that there is a debate among scientists about whether life evolved. The movement stresses the importance of recognizing the existence of this supposed debate, seeking to convince the public, politicians, and cultural leaders that schools should \\"Teach the Controversy\\". In fact, there is no such controversy in the scientific community; the scientific consensus is that life evolved. Joint statement issued by the national science academies of 67 countries, including the United Kingdom's Royal Society.From the world's largest general scientific society: * * Intelligent design is widely viewed as a stalking horse for its proponents' campaign against what they say is the materialist foundation of science, which they argue leaves no room for the possibility of God. Neo-creationism Advocates of intelligent design from a Christian standpoint seek to keep God and the Bible out of the discussion, and present intelligent design in the language of science as though it were a scientific hypothesis. \\"...intelligent design does not address metaphysical and religious questions such as the nature or identity of the designer,\\" and \\"...the nature, moral character and purposes of this intelligence lie beyond the competence of science and must be left to religion and philosophy\\". In: \\"...the first thing that has to be done is to get the Bible out of the discussion.... This is not to say that the biblical issues are unimportant; the point is rather that the time to address them will be after we have separated materialist prejudice from scientific fact\\". The Wedge However, among a significant proportion of the general public in the United States the major concern is whether conventional evolutionary biology is compatible with belief in God and in the Bible, and how this issue is taught in schools. The public controversy was given widespread media coverage in the United States, particularly during the Kitzmiller v. Dover trial in late 2005 and after President George W. Bush expressed support for the idea of teaching intelligent design alongside evolution in August 2005. In response to Bush's statement and the pending federal trial, Time magazine ran an eight-page cover story on the Evolution Wars in which they examined the issue of teaching intelligent design in the classroom.  * The cover of the magazine featured a parody of The Creation of Adam from the Sistine Chapel. Rather than pointing at Adam, Michelangelo's God points at the image of a chimpanzee contemplating the caption reading \\"The push to teach 'intelligent design' raises a question: Does God have a place in science class?\\".  In the Kitzmiller v. Dover case, the court ruled that intelligent design was a religious and creationist position, finding that God and intelligent design were both distinct from the material that should be covered in a science class.\\"ID is not a new scientific argument, but is rather an old religious argument for the existence of God. He traced this argument back to at least Thomas Aquinas in the 13th century, who framed the argument as a syllogism: Wherever complex design exists, there must have been a designer; nature is complex; therefore nature must have had an intelligent designer.\\" \\"This argument for the existence of God was advanced early in the 19th century by Reverend Paley\\" (the teleological argument) \\"The only apparent difference between the argument made by Paley and the argument for ID, as expressed by defense expert witnesses Behe and Minnich, is that ID's 'official position' does not acknowledge that the designer is God.\\" , Ruling, p. 24. Theistic science Empirical science uses the scientific method to create a posteriori knowledge based on observation and repeated testing of hypotheses and theories. Intelligent design proponents seek to change this fundamental basis of science by eliminating \\"methodological naturalism\\" from science[Johnson positions himself as a \\"theistic realist\\" against \\"methodological naturalism\\".] and replacing it with what the leader of the intelligent design movement, Phillip E. Johnson, calls \\"theistic realism\\". Some have called this approach \\"methodological supernaturalism\\", which means belief in a transcendent, nonnatural dimension of reality inhabited by a transcendent, nonnatural deity.See, for instance: Intelligent design proponents argue that naturalistic explanations fail to explain certain phenomena and that supernatural explanations provide a very simple and intuitive explanation for the origins of life and the universe. Proponents say evidence exists in the forms of irreducible complexity and specified complexity that cannot be explained by natural processes. They also hold that religious neutrality requires the teaching of both evolution and intelligent design in schools, saying that teaching only evolution unfairly discriminates against those holding creationist beliefs. Teaching both, they argue, allows for the possibility of religious belief, without causing the state to actually promote such beliefs. Many intelligent design followers believe that \\"Scientism\\" is itself a religion that promotes secularism and materialism in an attempt to erase theism from public life, and they view their work in the promotion of intelligent design as a way to return religion to a central role in education and other public spheres. Some allege that this larger debate is often the subtext for arguments made over intelligent design, though others note that intelligent design serves as an effective proxy for the religious beliefs of prominent intelligent design proponents in their efforts to advance their religious point of view within society. It has been argued that methodological naturalism is not an assumption of science, but a result of science well done: the God explanation is the least parsimonious, so according to Occam's razor, it cannot be a scientific explanation. Intelligent design has not presented a credible scientific case, substituting public support for scientific research. If the argument to give \\"equal time for all theories\\" were actually practiced, there would be no logical limit to the number of mutually incompatible supernatural \\"theories\\" regarding the origins and diversity of life to be taught in the public school system, including intelligent design parodies such as the Flying Spaghetti Monster \\"theory\\"; intelligent design does not provide a mechanism for discriminating among them. Philosopher of biology Elliott Sober, for example, states that intelligent design is not falsifiable because \\"[d]efenders of ID always have a way out\\". Intelligent design proponent Michael Behe concedes \\"You can't prove intelligent design by experiment\\". The inference that an intelligent designer created life on Earth, which advocate William Dembski has said could alternately be an \\"alien\\" life force,William Dembski, 1998. The Design Inference. has been compared to the a priori claim that aliens helped the ancient Egyptians build the pyramids. In both cases, the effect of this outside intelligence is not repeatable, observable or falsifiable, and it violates the principle of parsimony. From a strictly empirical standpoint, one may list what is known about Egyptian construction techniques, but one must admit ignorance about exactly how the Egyptians built the pyramids. Inter- faith outreach Supporters of intelligent design have also reached out to other faith groups with similar accounts of creation with the hope that the broader coalition will have greater influence in supporting science education that does not contradict their religious views. Many religious bodies have responded by expressing support for evolution. The Roman Catholic Church has stated that religious faith is fully compatible with science, which is limited to dealing only with the natural world ‚Äîa position described by the term theistic evolution. While some in the Roman Catholic Church reject Intelligent design for various philosophical and theological reasons, others, such as Christoph Sch√∂nborn, Archbishop of Vienna, have shown support for it. The arguments of intelligent design have been directly challenged by the over 10,000 clergy who signed the Clergy Letter Project. Prominent scientists who strongly express religious faith, such as the astronomer George Coyne and the biologist Ken Miller, have been at the forefront of opposition to intelligent design. While creationist organizations have welcomed intelligent design's support against naturalism, they have also been critical of its refusal to identify the designer, and have pointed to previous failures of the same argument. Rabbi Natan Slifkin directly criticized the advocates of intelligent design as presenting a perspective of God that is dangerous to religion.Natan Slifkin (2006). The Challenge of Creation (New York: Yashar Books) 288 ff. Those who promote it as parallel to religion, he asserts, do not truly understand it. Slifkin criticizes intelligent design's advocacy of teaching their perspective in biology classes, wondering why no one claims that God's hand should be taught in other secular classes, such as history, physics or geology. Slifkin also asserts that the intelligent design movement is inordinately concerned with portraying God as \\"in control\\" when it comes to things that cannot be easily explained by science, but not in control in respect to things which can be explained by scientific theory. Kenneth Miller expressed a view similar to Slifkin's: \\"[T]he struggles of the Intelligent Design movement are best understood as clamorous and disappointing double failures‚Äîrejected by science because they do not fit the facts, and having failed religion because they think too little of God. Intelligent design also has advocates from an Islamic standpoint who believe that, while life may have developed in stages over time, human beings are uniquely created by Allah and not evolved from our common ancestor with apes. It is from Adam and Hawwa (Eve) that humanity is said to have originated from. Defining science Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the world.Ludwik Fleck (1935), Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact reminds us that before a specific fact 'existed', it had to be created as part of a social agreement within a community. The boundaries between what is and what is not to be considered science, known as the demarcation problem, continues to be debated among philosophers of science and scientists in various fields.Cover, J.A., Curd, Martin (Eds, 1998) Philosophy of Science: The Central Issues, 1‚Äì82. The U.S. National Academy of Sciences has stated that \\"creationism, intelligent design, and other claims of supernatural intervention in the origin of life or of species are not science because they are not testable by the methods of science.\\" The U.S. National Science Teachers Association and the American Association for the Advancement of Science have termed it pseudoscience. National Science Teachers Association, a professional association of 55,000 science teachers and administrators Others in the scientific community have concurred, and some have called it junk science. * *Robert T. Pennock Tower of Babel: The Evidence Against the New Creationism. * For a theory to qualify as scientific, Discusses principles of induction, deduction and probability related to the expectation of consistency, testability, and multiple observations. Chapter 8 discusses parsimony (Occam's razor) Discusses the scientific method, including the principles of falsifiability, testability, progressive development of theory, dynamic self-correcting of hypotheses, and parsimony, or \\"Occam's razor\\"., 4: whether ID is science. The ruling discusses central aspects of expectations in the scientific community that a scientific theory be testable, dynamic, correctible, progressive, based upon multiple observations, and provisional, it is expected to be: *Consistent *Parsimonious (sparing in its proposed entities or explanations, see Occam's Razor) *Useful (describes and explains observed phenomena, and can be used predictively) *Empirically testable and falsifiable (see Falsifiability) *Based on multiple observations, often in the form of controlled, repeated experiments *Correctable and dynamic (modified in the light of observations that do not support it) *Progressive (refines previous theories) *Provisional or tentative (is open to experimental checking, and does not assert certainty) For any theory, hypothesis or conjecture to be considered scientific, it must meet most, and ideally all, of these criteria. The fewer criteria are met, the less scientific it is; and if it meets only a few or none at all, then it cannot be treated as scientific in any meaningful sense of the word. Typical objections to defining intelligent design as science are that it lacks consistency,See, e.g., violates the principle of parsimony,Intelligent design fails to pass Occam's razor. Adding entities (an intelligent agent, a designer) to the equation is not strictly necessary to explain events. See, e.g., is not scientifically useful,See, e.g., is not falsifiable,The designer is not falsifiable, since its existence is typically asserted without sufficient conditions to allow a falsifying observation. The designer being beyond the realm of the observable, claims about its existence can be neither supported nor undermined by observation, making intelligent design and the argument from design analytic a posteriori arguments. See, e.g., Ruling, p. 22 and p. 77. is not empirically testable,That intelligent design is not empirically testable stems from the fact that it violates a basic premise of science, naturalism. See, e.g., Ruling, p. 22 and p. 66. and is not correctable, dynamic, provisional or progressive.Intelligent design professes to offer an answer that does not need to be defined or explained, the intelligent agent, designer. By asserting a conclusion that cannot be accounted for scientifically, the designer, intelligent design cannot be sustained by any further explanation, and objections raised to those who accept intelligent design make little headway. Thus intelligent design is not a provisional assessment of data, which can change when new information is discovered. Once it is claimed that a conclusion that need not be accounted for has been established, there is simply no possibility of future correction. The idea of the progressive growth of scientific ideas is required to explain previous data and any previously unexplainable data. See, e.g., the brief explanation in p. 66. The September 2005 statement by 38 Nobel laureates stated that: \\"Intelligent design is fundamentally unscientific; it cannot be tested as scientific theory because its central conclusion is based on belief in the intervention of a supernatural agent\\". The October 2005 statement, by a coalition representing more than 70,000 Australian scientists and science teachers said: \\"intelligent design is not science\\" and called on \\"all schools not to teach Intelligent Design (ID) as science, because it fails to qualify on every count as a scientific theory\\". Critics also say that the intelligent design doctrine does not meet the Daubert Standard, the criteria for scientific evidence mandated by the US Supreme Court. The Daubert Standard governs which evidence can be considered scientific in United States federal courts and most state courts. Its four criteria are: *The theoretical underpinnings of the methods must yield testable predictions by means of which the theory could be falsified. *The methods should preferably be published in a peer-reviewed journal. *There should be a known rate of error that can be used in evaluating the results. *The methods should be generally accepted within the relevant scientific community. In Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, using these criteria and others mentioned above, Judge Jones ruled that \\"... we have addressed the seminal question of whether ID is science. We have concluded that it is not, and moreover that ID cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents\\". At the Kitzmiller trial, philosopher Robert T. Pennock described a common approach to distinguishing science from non-science as examining a theory's compliance with methodological naturalism, the basic method in science of seeking natural explanations without assuming the existence or nonexistence of the supernatural. Intelligent design proponents criticize this method and argue that science, if its goal is to discover truth, must be able to accept evidentially supported, supernatural explanations. , Whether ID Is Science *, Lead defense expert Professor Behe admitted that his broadened definition of science, which encompasses ID, would also include astrology. *See also Additionally, philosopher of science Larry Laudan and cosmologist Sean Carroll argue against any a priori criteria for distinguishing science from pseudoscience.Carroll, Sean. \\"What Questions Can Science Answer?\\". 2009. http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/07/15/what-questions- can-science-answer Laudan, as well as philosopher Barbara Forrest, state that the content of the hypothesis must first be examined to determine its ability to solve empirical problems.Forrest, Barbara. \\"Methodological Naturalism and Philosophical Naturalism: Clarifying the Connection.\\" Philo, Vol. 3, No. 2 (Fall-Winter 2000), pp. 7‚Äì29 http://www2.selu.edu/Academics/Faculty/bforrest/ForrestPhilo.pdf Methodological naturalism is therefore an a posteriori criterion due to its ability to yield consistent results. Peer review The failure to follow the procedures of scientific discourse and the failure to submit work to the scientific community that withstands scrutiny have weighed against intelligent design being accepted as valid science. The intelligent design movement has not published a properly peer-reviewed article supporting ID in a scientific journal, and has failed to publish peer-reviewed research or data supporting ID., 4. Whether ID is Science, p. 87 Intelligent design, by appealing to a supernatural agent, directly conflicts with the principles of science, which limit its inquiries to empirical, observable and ultimately testable data and which require explanations to be based on empirical evidence. Dembski, Behe and other intelligent design proponents say bias by the scientific community is to blame for the failure of their research to be published.Free Speech on Evolution Campaign Main Page Discovery Institute, Center for Science and Culture. Intelligent design proponents believe that their writings are rejected for not conforming to purely naturalistic, non-supernatural mechanisms rather than because their research is not up to \\"journal standards\\", and that the merit of their articles is overlooked. Some scientists describe this claim as a conspiracy theory. Michael Shermer has rebutted the claim, noting \\"Anyone who thinks that scientists do not question Darwinism has never been to an evolutionary conference.\\" He noted that scientists such as Joan Roughgarden and Lynn Margulis have challenged certain Darwinist theories and offered explanations of their own and despite this they \\"have not been persecuted, shunned, fired or even expelled. Why? Because they are doing science, not religion.\\" The issue that supernatural explanations do not conform to the scientific method became a sticking point for intelligent design proponents in the 1990s, and is addressed in the wedge strategy as an aspect of science that must be challenged before intelligent design can be accepted by the broader scientific community. Critics and advocates debate over whether intelligent design produces new research and has legitimately attempted to publish this research. For instance, the Templeton Foundation, a former funder of the Discovery Institute and a major supporter of projects seeking to reconcile science and religion, says that it asked intelligent design proponents to submit proposals for actual research, but none were ever submitted. Charles L. Harper Jr., foundation vice-president, said: \\"From the point of view of rigor and intellectual seriousness, the intelligent design people don't come out very well in our world of scientific review\\". The only article published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal that made a case for intelligent design was quickly withdrawn by the publisher for having circumvented the journal's peer-review standards. Written by the Discovery Institute's Center for Science & Culture Director Stephen C. Meyer, it appeared in the peer-reviewed journal Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington in August 2004. The article was a literature review, which means that it did not present any new research, but rather culled quotations and claims from other papers to argue that the Cambrian explosion could not have happened by natural processes. The choice of venue for this article was also considered problematic, because it was so outside the normal subject matter (see Sternberg peer review controversyThe Sternberg peer review controversy and several similar academic disputes are the subject of the 2008 documentary \\"Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed\\".). Dembski has written that \\"perhaps the best reason [to be skeptical of his ideas] is that intelligent design has yet to establish itself as a thriving scientific research program.\\" In a 2001 interview, Dembski said that he stopped submitting to peer-reviewed journals because of their slow time-to-print and that he makes more money from publishing books. In the Dover trial, the judge found that intelligent design features no scientific research or testing.Ruling, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District 4: whether ID is science There, intelligent design proponents cited just one paper, on simulation modeling of evolution by Behe and David Snoke, which mentioned neither irreducible complexity nor intelligent design and which Behe admitted did not rule out known evolutionary mechanisms. 4: whether ID is science Michael Lynch called the conclusions of the article \\"an artifact of unwarranted biological assumptions, inappropriate mathematical modeling, and faulty logic\\". In sworn testimony, however, Behe said: \\"There are no peer reviewed articles by anyone advocating for intelligent design supported by pertinent experiments or calculations which provide detailed rigorous accounts of how intelligent design of any biological system occurred\\".Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, October 19, 2005, AM session Kitzmiller Testimony, Behe As summarized by the judge, Behe conceded that there are no peer-reviewed articles supporting his claims of intelligent design or irreducible complexity. In his ruling, the judge wrote: \\"A final indicator of how ID has failed to demonstrate scientific warrant is the complete absence of peer-reviewed publications supporting the theory\\". The Discovery Institute has published lists of articles and books which they say support intelligent design and have been peer-reviewed, including the two articles mentioned above. Critics, largely members of the scientific community, reject this claim, stating that no established scientific journal has yet published an intelligent design article. Rather, intelligent design proponents have set up their own journals with peer review that lacks impartiality and rigor, consisting entirely of intelligent design supporters. Critics also state that even if these papers could be accepted as cases of support for intelligent design passing peer review, the output from the ID community is still fairly minuscule, especially when compared to the number of peer reviewed articles supporting evolution. Critics state that publishing material is not enough; that scientific ideas must withstand scrutiny and be built upon and that any papers supporting ID have not led to any productive work. Intelligence as an observable quality The phrase intelligent design makes use of an assumption of the quality of an observable intelligence, a concept that has no scientific consensus definition. William Dembski, for example, has written that \\"Intelligence leaves behind a characteristic signature\\". The characteristics of intelligence are assumed by intelligent design proponents to be observable without specifying what the criteria for the measurement of intelligence should be. Dembski, instead, asserts that \\"in special sciences ranging from forensics to archaeology to SETI (the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence), appeal to a designing intelligence is indispensable\\". How this appeal is made and what this implies as to the definition of intelligence are topics left largely unaddressed. Seth Shostak, a researcher with the SETI Institute, disputed Dembski's comparison of SETI and intelligent design, saying that intelligent design advocates base their inference of design on complexity‚Äîthe argument being that some biological systems are too complex to have been made by natural processes‚Äîwhile SETI researchers are looking primarily for artificiality. Critics say that the design detection methods proposed by intelligent design proponents are radically different from conventional design detection, undermining the key elements that make it possible as legitimate science. Intelligent design proponents, they say, are proposing both searching for a designer without knowing anything about that designer's abilities, parameters, or intentions (which scientists do know when searching for the results of human intelligence), as well as denying the very distinction between natural/artificial design that allows scientists to compare complex designed artifacts against the background of the sorts of complexity found in nature.\\"For human artifacts, we know the designer's identity, human, and the mechanism of design, as we have experience based upon empirical evidence that humans can make such things, as well as many other attributes including the designer's abilities, needs, and desires. With ID, proponents assert that they refuse to propose hypotheses on the designer's identity, do not propose a mechanism, and the designer, he/she/it/they, has never been seen. In that vein, defense expert Professor Minnich agreed that in the case of human artifacts and objects, we know the identity and capacities of the human designer, but we do not know any of those attributes for the designer of biological life. In addition, Professor Behe agreed that for the design of human artifacts, we know the designer and its attributes and we have a baseline for human design that does not exist for design of biological systems. Professor Behe's only response to these seemingly insurmountable points of disanalogy was that the inference still works in science fiction movies\\".‚Äî, p. 81 As a means of criticism, certain skeptics have pointed to a challenge of intelligent design derived from the study of artificial intelligence. The criticism is a counter to intelligent design claims about what makes a design intelligent, specifically that \\"no preprogrammed device can be truly intelligent, that intelligence is irreducible to natural processes\\". This claim is similar in type to an assumption of Cartesian dualism that posits a strict separation between \\"mind\\" and the material Universe. However, in studies of artificial intelligence, while there is an implicit assumption that supposed \\"intelligence\\" or creativity of a computer program is determined by the capabilities given to it by the computer programmer, artificial intelligence need not be bound to an inflexible system of rules. Rather, if a computer program can access randomness as a function, this effectively allows for a flexible, creative, and adaptive intelligence. Evolutionary algorithms, a subfield of machine learning (itself a subfield of artificial intelligence), have been used to mathematically demonstrate that randomness and selection can be used to \\"evolve\\" complex, highly adapted structures that are not explicitly designed by a programmer. Evolutionary algorithms use the Darwinian metaphor of random mutation, selection and the survival of the fittest to solve diverse mathematical and scientific problems that are usually not solvable using conventional methods. Intelligence derived from randomness is essentially indistinguishable from the \\"innate\\" intelligence associated with biological organisms, and poses a challenge to the intelligent design conception that intelligence itself necessarily requires a designer. Cognitive science continues to investigate the nature of intelligence along these lines of inquiry. The intelligent design community, for the most part, relies on the assumption that intelligence is readily apparent as a fundamental and basic property of complex systems.

Early life He was born in Annapolis, Maryland and attended St. John's College, Annapolis, from which he graduated at age 17. He studied law under his uncle, Severus Pinkney, and was admitted to the bar, but never practiced. Instead, influenced by his mother, a devout Methodist, in 1831 he entered Princeton Theological Seminary in New Jersey to study for the ministry. Financial and family circumstances forced his withdrawal two years later, and Pinkney became a tutor to the family of John Neville Steele, a devout Episcopalian in Dorchester County, Maryland. He decided to apply for holy orders with that denomination.Betty and Neil Hotchkiss, History of St. Matthew's Parish, Prince George's County at p. 12, available at http://www.stmatthewshyattsville.org/st_matthews_history_to_1961.pdf He married Miss Elizabeth Lowndes, from a prominent family in Prince George's County, on October 2, 1838.Hotchkiss at p. 12 Career Maryland's bishop, the Right Reverend William Murray Stone ordained Pinkney to the diaconate on April 12, 1835, and to the priesthood the following year. Rev. Pinkney was initially assigned to Somerset and Coventry parishes on the Eastern Shore, but his health soon failed. He then became as rector of St. Matthew's Episcopal Church in Hyattsville, Maryland (formerly known as Addison's Chapel) and its chapel of ease Zion Parish. During his leadership of those parishes, which lasted until 1857, Rev. Pinkney secured the rebuilding of both churches. St. Matthew's congregation moved to a larger Gothic-style frame building in Bladensburg, Maryland in 1844, which was consecrated in 1856. St. John's Episcopal Church, Zion Parish (which had once been the lower chapel of that parish and burned down in 1845), was rebuilt and consecrated in 1856. After getting both congregations onto solid footings and declining a call from the Church of the Epiphany (Washington, D.C.), Rev. Pinkney finally decided to move into Washington, D.C. and serve as rector of the Church of the Ascension.Hotchkiss at p. 15 During the American Civil War , bishop William Rollinson Whittingham, who had convinced Rev. Pinkney to accept the Ascension position just before the war, reprimanded the southern-sympathizing priest for failing to say prayers for President Lincoln, and instituted ecclesiastical proceedings against him (which failed). Rev. Pinkney served at Ascension 13 years, and after the war ended also served as assistant to Rt.Rev. Whittingham, whose Northern sympathies had caused considerable unpopularity.http://www.ascensionandsaintagnes.org/html/parishlife/parishhistory.htm Episcopate In 1870, the Diocese of Maryland held its convention in the Church of the Epiphany in Washington, D.C. and Pinkney was elected as suffragan to the ailing Rt.Rev. Whittingham. Presiding Bishop Benjamin Bosworth Smith was his principal consecrator on October 6, 1870, assisted by bishops John Johns of Virginia and Thomas Atkinson of North Carolina. Rt.Rev. Pinkney administered the diocese during Whittingham's extended convalescence before succeeding his mentor upon his death in 1879.

The train ran a course along Park Boulevard, near the intersection with Park Avenue, around Spring Creek into Comet Hollow. It was the second ride Milton S. Hershey purchased for his park, after buying a carousel. While the railroad is no longer in operation, the train has been undergoing restoration since 2007, and was first publicly displayed in 2011. History = 1909 - 1970 = Milton S. Hershey, owner of what was then called Hershey Park, had made the decision to purchase a carousel for his amusement park in 1908. Hershey decided to place the ride on the western side of the park, a considerable distance from the town center of Hershey, Pennsylvania. As part of placing the ride in that location, he was determined to purchase a transport ride to get visitors of the park from the town center to the carousel.Hershey Community Archives Chronology Database In 1909, Hershey had learned that a small resort outside of Lancaster, Pennsylvania called Peoples Bathing Beach, owned by John B. Peoples, was opening a miniature electric railroad. Hershey went to the bathing beach to see it for himself. Impressed with the ride, he decided to purchase one for the park. Purchased on May 8, 1909, for a sum of , construction of the ride began in July 1910. The ride opened for its first run in September 1910. The ride operated a single track with no switches, which meant the track could only hold one train. When the ride opened in 1910, there was one station located near the intersection of Park Boulevard and Park Avenue, which never changed throughout the remainder of the ride's existence. The other station was located in what is today western Comet Hollow near the carousel and the original pool. When that pool was closed, drained and filled, following the 1928 season, the station in the western end of Comet Hollow was moved to the eastern end of Comet Hollow along the creek, near the entrance of the Mill Chute, a log flume ride. The station remained in that location until 1950, when it was moved to the southern end of Comet Hollow, adjacent to the Comet and parallel to Spring Creek. = 1971 = Following the 1970 season, Hershey Park began a redevelopment plan which called for the park to become a theme park. Hershey Park was renamed Hersheypark, and the park went through a number of other changes, including removing a variety of old rides. The Miniature Railroad, however, continued to operate despite the addition of the park's gate in 1971. The addition of the gate and the location of the ride placed a portion of the track within the park gate, and a portion of the track outside the park gate. The Comet Hollow station was inside the park, and the Park Boulevard station was outside the gate. Guests of the park could get their hand stamped so they would be able to renter the park by taking the Miniature Railroad back to Comet Hollow. Towards the end of the 1971 season, the ride fell victim to vandalism. Vandals placed objects on the tracks, which caused the train to derail. The train was damaged and not able to be used for operation. As a result, the ride was placed in storage for the 1972 season. However, the park still wanted to restore and operate the ride. One such concept was developed after the park opened the Rhineland section of the park in 1973. The ride would have been called the Rhineland Express. However, due to the extensive damage done to train, combined with slow economic years in 1973 and 1974, among other plans cancelled, the plan to bring back the Miniature Railroad in some fashion was abandoned, and the ride was never repaired or refurbished. = 2007: Restoration = Hersheypark celebrated its 100th season in 2007. This sparked an interest in seeing the Miniature Railroad restored. Later that year, Friends of the Hershey Trolley, in conjunction with Hershey Entertainment & Resorts (owner of Hersheypark), announced that they were restoring the Miniature Railroad train. One car was placed on display in 2007, and again in the 2011 Hershey Memorial Day Parade.

Its closest known relative is Chromera velia. Vitrella differs from Chromera in having a more complex lifecycle, for instance involving a range of sizes and morphologies. Also, while Vitrella is greenish coloured, Chromera is brown coloured. The differences are in the types of secondary pigments that characterize each genus. Both genera lack chlorophyll b or c; these absences link the two taxonomically, as algae bearing only chlorophyll a are quite few amid the biodiversity of life. Phylogenetically, both Vitrella and Chromera are relatives of the obligately parasitic phylum Apicomplexa, which includes Plasmodium, the agent of malaria. Both Vitrella brassicaformis and Chromera velia are photosynthetic. Isolation and identification Extant cultures of Vitrella were isolated by R. Moore. These are available from the NCMA culture collection in Maine USA (cultures 3156, 3157, 3158) and are also backed up in other collections such as NQAIF (Australia), and CCAP (UK). In 2004 the strains deposited to CCMP (now NCMA) by R. Moore were \\"re-isolated\\" (repurified) manually by staff at CCMP. The staff worked under the assumption that the flagellate (motile) stage could be separated permanently from the benthic spherical stages, which is not so, as these are stages of a single lifecycle. The fact that this unusual peer-review process could have happened in the history of the description of the species is an example of the very unusual lifecycle/morphology combination of the organism compared to other photosynthetic eukaryotes that many culture collections were accustomed to dealing with. However it is not an unusual lifecycle for dinoflagellates which are photosynthetic relatives of Vitrella. Besides its varied somatic lifecycle, V. brassicaformis' putative gametogenesis and recombining stages have been well documented. Lifestyle The term \\"mixotrophy\\" defines this lifestyle which mixes phototrophy (light as energy source) and heterotrophy (predation as energy source). Mixotrophic dinoflagellates are extremely common in the food web, and \\"Vitrella\\"-like organisms may have been the ancestors of such, raising the possibility that further families of Chromerida may eventually be found in the environment. Description Vitrella brassicaformis was described in 2011 by Obornik et al., from type material RM11 (CCMP3155)https://ncma.bigelow.org/node/1/strain/CCMP3155/printInfo originally isolated from host Pocillopora damicornis. Major differences between Vitrella and Chromera were noted by the authors and two distinct families Vitrellaceae and Chromeraceae were set up. Evolution and taxonomy Just as for its sister family Chromeraceae, the family Vitrellaceae is a bridge between alternate views of protist evolution: the botanical view versus the zoological view. These views need not be opposed. Apicomplexans (being non-photosynthetic) are generally described using the zoological code, while protistan (often unicellular) algae have often been described using the botanical code. Protistologists have always been free to use whichever code they choose, and these two organisms (Vitrella and Chromera) are prime examples of the need for this freedom. They possess a flagellate stage and a benthic stage. Researcher Thomas Cavalier-Smith investigating the origins of apicomplexans and dinozoans, suggested a joint category Myzozoa encompassing both of these superphyla, plus related groups the colpodellids and perkinsids. By morphology and lifestyle,V. brassicaformis more closely resembles an ancestral Myzozoan than C. velia does. V. brassicaformis has a circular plastid genome as an ancestral Myzozoan would have had, and is also capable of hunting (myzocytosis) as they were. These two lifestyles, autotrophy and heterotrophy, found in one organism (V. brassicaformis) represent the store of potential that was able to lead to the Myzozoan radiation. Ecology The \\"type-host\\" of Vitrella is Pocillopora damicornis (tropical). An alternate host is Leptastrea purpurea (tropical). Vitrellaceae occur globally, associated with corals.

Early life and education Born in Salem, Massachusetts, he attended Shelburne Falls and Brattleboro Academies in 1851-52, then taught New Salem Academy in 1853. He attended Middlebury College and after graduating in 1856 attended the General Theological Seminary and married.http://acbiorecord.yanco.com/1855.html He received a doctorate of Divinity from Kenyon College in 1869, and an honorary doctor of law degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1898.https://secure.www.upenn.edu/secretary/hondegchron.html Career Whitaker was ordained to the diaconate on July 15, 1863, and as an Episcopal priest on August 7, 1863. He was elected the first rector of St. Paul's Church, Englewood, Colorado in 1865 and technically remained there until March, 1867, although active as a missionary in the surrounding countryside. In 1863, Whitaker founded a small Episcopal congregation in Dayton, then in the Nevada Territory, a year after his wife helped found a Sunday School in Virginia City, Nevada. He became missionary bishop of Nevada and Arizona succeeding Joseph Cruikshank Talbot in 1869 (Nevada did not receive separate diocesan status until 1971).http://www.nvdiocese.org/RESOURCES/HISTORY/_HistoryDir.html Bishop Charles McIlvaine of Ohio, bishop Alfred Lee of Delaware and bishop Manton Eastburn of Massachusetts consecrated him on October 13, 1869. For many years, Bishop Whitaker made St. Paul's the Prospector Episcopal Church in Virginia City his base, and even rebuilt it after a disastrous fire in 1875.http://www.stpaultheprospector.com/history/ Rt.Rev. Whitaker also established in 1874 the Chapel of the Good Shepherd, a missionary church for Asian railroad workers in Carson City and the following year a chapel for Chinese workers in Virginia City (which was destroyed by a citywide fire a few months later in October 1875). Growing anti-Chinese feeling also prompted its prime mover, Ah Foo, to become a missionary in China. Bishop Whitaker also established a mission to the Paiute tribe, St. James Mission in Wadsworth.http://www.onlinenevada.org/articles/episcopal-church-nevada Bishop Whitaker personally founded Trinity Church Mission in Reno in 1873, which somehow barely escaped the fire which destroyed much of the city in 1878. After securing a land grant from the Central Pacific Railroad, in 1879 he established Bishop Whitaker's School for Girls, a school for girls (both day and boarding) overlooking the Truckee River in Reno. However, in 1886 the University of Nevada established a free school nearby and its founder moved to Philadelphia, so the Episcopal school closed in 1894.http://renohistorical.org/items/show/30?tour=2&index;=0 Bishop Whitaker initially translated to the Diocese of Pennsylvania to serve as coadjutor to bishop William B. Stevens, and stopped overseeing the Nevada diocese in 1888, after the General Convention transferred oversight to bishop Abiel Leonard of Salt Lake City and a year after Bishop Whitaker succeeded Bishop Stevens as diocesan bishop of Pennsylvania. He served as the diocese's fifth bishop from 1887-1911. From 1904 until his death, he also led the Pennsylvania Bible Society as its 10th president (Pennsylvania's first bishop, William White, had founded the society).http://pabible.org/presidents.html Beginning in 1902, his eventual successor, Alexander Mackay-Smith served as his coadjutor. Death and legacy The elderly bishop died in Philadelphia after contracting influenza, and the funeral was held at the Church of Our Savior.Associated press wire Feb. 13, 1911 Although the Episcopal school Rev. Whitaker founded in Reno closed in 1894 and its buildings were used first by the University of Nevada and later as a hospital, the site is now a park named after its founding missionary bishop.

The network produced original programming as well as live conversations among users via platforms such as Skype and Google+. Live content was previously streamed for 8 hours each weekday, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. EST. Instead of the usual TV news format of individual \\"shows\\", the network is divided into shorter segments covering an individual story or topic from the parent website as well as other segments pertaining to a specific part of the site itself (politics, money, front page, etc.) It launched on August 13, 2012. On January 8, 2016, Arianna Huffington announced that HuffPost Live would be scaled back to reorganize the Huffington Posts video strategy toward more shareable online content.http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/media/2016/01/8587343/big-pivot- huffpost-video Ever since this reorganization, HuffPost Live's programming has consisted of rerun content from previous truly live shows combined with a varying number of new live celebrity interviews per day before the cessation of new live content on March 28, 2016. History Huffington Post co-founder Arianna Huffington announced plans in February 2012 to launch a \\"breakthrough project\\" in a blog post to mark a year since the news website was acquired by AOL. The project, then called \\"HuffPost Streaming Network\\", was described by Huffington as a \\"more relaxed, more free-flowing, and much more spontaneous and interactive\\" platform to disseminate content, unlike television. The project was later renamed \\"HuffPost Live\\". Huffington Post founding editor Roy Sekoff and Gabriel Lewis, head of AOL Studios, co-created and developed the project. The third member of the senior management team is Mitch Semel, Executive Editor of HuffPost Live. Sekoff described it as \\"CNN meets YouTube\\". He said the project intends to take advantage of the Huffington Posts \\"engaged\\" community which produced 54 million comments on the site in 2011. The company held a demonstration to showcase the interactive components of the network on February 2, 2012 at a press conference in Manhattan. During the press conference, Huffington noted that the network will launch with 100-strong staff. The site launched on August 13, 2012 with Verizon and Cadillac listed as founding partners. In December 2014, HuffPost Live and Kosiner Venture Capital made an application to the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission to bring the service to conventional television in Canada.AOL Launches Bid to Get HuffPost Live on Canadian TV The Hollywood Reporter 2015-12-19HuffPost Live seeks approval from CRTC to start Canadian stream Globe And Mail 2015-12-18Huffington Post applies to CRTC for Canadian television channel The Canadian Press 2015-12-18CRTC Public Proceedings 2014-1310-4 Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunication 2015-12-18 Beginning on January 11, 2016 the live portion of HuffPost Live was significantly scaled back as a part of a reorganization effort announced on January 8, 2016. HuffPost Live's programming is now made up of mostly old content being re-aired. The live component continues to exist, though the emphasis on news and politics has been removed, instead being replaced with a few celebrity interviews per day at scheduled times.http://www.huffpostlive.com On March 25, 2016 HuffPost Live aired its final segment, an interview with Ric Flair and Charlotte Flair. As a replacement, the same format will be attempted utilizing Facebook's new Facebook Live feature. The first segment, under the HuffPost Entertainment Facebook Page, featured Tom Hiddleston and Wrenn Schmidt being interviewed by Caroline Modarressy-Tehrani on the HuffPost Live set but featured no branding and utilized a single roving camera rather than the previous multi-camera format.

HuffPost Live formerly featured 8 hours of daily programming for five days a week, on-demand, on mobile and online. Currently, programming only features previously aired segments. Since its launch, HuffPost Live concentrated on driving viewer engagement. ‚ÄúThe news is no longer about a few people telling everyone else what happened‚Äîit's about everyone telling everyone what's happening right now. And now. And now‚Ä¶ This shift from presentation to participation is what fuels HuffPost Live,‚Äù said Huffington Post in the launch press release.http://smp.businesswire.com/pages/huffpost- live-launch-media-resources Segments often feature viewers and other members of the Huffington Post universe, including reporters and members of the Huffington Post community. Segments are open to participants joining the conversation via webcam, smart phones and tablet computers using Skype, Google+ and other video communication platforms. Programming is produced from AOL/Huffington Post studios in New York City. Although there was initially a staff in Los Angeles as well, the LA production site was shut down on Aug 30, 2013, with some of the LA staff relocating to NY. The live stream is interrupted by promos for HuffPost Live after which a still promoting the next program replaces the video for the ongoing program. The viewer must click on the website to get the video back. Advertising on the network consists of pre- roll commercials on video-on-demand clips. The network is also backed by \\"premium\\" sponsors that will integrate their advertising into the network's content.

It was founded in 1974 by a group of party wall surveyors. It helped draft the Party Wall etc. Act 1996 and continues to educate its members and the public about party wall issues. History Thisbe, by John William Waterhouse, 1909. The Pyramus and Thisbe Club was founded in 1974 at the instigation of the late John Anstey, following widespread misreporting of the case of Gyle-Thompson v Wall Street (1973). The Club was formed to exchange news and opinions about interesting party wall cases. Its first Chairman was Alan Gillett. The original membership of 46 active party wall surveyors agreed to meet quarterly and these early meetings took place at the Little Ship Club in the City of London. Membership grew but was then limited to 100 and the Club moved its meetings to The Cafe Royal in Regent Street. The club takes its name from Ovid's Pyramus and Thisbe, lovers kept apart by their rival parents, but who whispered through a chink in a wall. The story has been retold by many including Shakespeare in A Midsummer Night's Dream. The Club's motto, a quotation from the play, is \\"The wall is down that parted their fathers.\\" The Club's quarterly newsletter is called Whispers. Until 1997, the Club's activities were confined to inner London, where the London Building Acts (Amendment) Act 1939 applied only to party walls in the former LCC area. In 1993 a Club working party began drafting a Parliamentary Private Bill for England and Wales. The Bill which was sponsored through Parliament by The Earl of Lytton (now a past chairman of the Club) received Government support and became the Party Wall etc. Act 1996. It came into force in July 1997. The Club's pivotal role in framing the Act was acknowledged by The Earl of Kinnoull during the debate following the Bill's second reading in the House of Lords, when he said of the Club, \\"I know that that club of professionals has done tremendous work. I pay particular tribute to its chairman, John Anstey, who, like other colleagues has been active in helping to draft the Bill.\\" The Pyramus and Thisbe Club continues to maintain relationships with Government and Parliament. Members of the Club have formed advisory panels to consider the Subterranean Development Bill and the Property Boundaries (Resolution of Disputes) Bill. The Club has assisted the Government in producing a guide to the Act and Club members have advised overseas governments on party wall and neighbourly matters. In a 2008 case in Romford County Court, His Honour Judge Platt acknowledged the Club's members when he said, \\"It is a tribute to the surveyor's profession as a whole and to the members of the Pyramus and Thisbe Club in particular that issues over party walls have generally been resolved by a pragmatic and cooperative approach to the provisions of the Act and consequently appeals to the County Court have been extremely rare.\\" The Club's membership is drawn from a mixture of surveyors, architects, engineers, other construction professionals and lawyers, all of whom have an interest in party wall matters. Today there are some 1000 members practising throughout England and Wales. The only qualification for membership is a serious professional interest in the subject and a willingness to disseminate information among fellow members about difficult or interesting cases. The Club is a non profit- making organisation and has acquired the status of a Learned Society. It promotes the highest standards of professional conduct among its members. The Club has published a two volume \\"Collected Papers\\" from the first 20 years of its proceedings and \\"The Party Wall Act Explained\\" written by the members of the original working party, now in its second, revised edition.

Accessed 3 February 2012 In 1881, the Waughs moved to Southgate, and in 1889, after her father resigned the ministry to dedicate himself to the NSPCC, the family settled in St Albans, Hertfordshire. The young Edna Waugh showed an early talent for drawing. When she was fourteen, a barrister friend of her father, William Clarke Hall (1866-1932) arranged for her to enter the Slade School of Fine Art. Whilst there, Edna was taught by Henry Tonks, \\"the most renowned and formidable teacher of his generation\\".\\"Tonks, Henry\\" The Oxford Dictionary of Art. Ed. Ian Chilvers. Oxford University Press, 2004. She studied alongside Gwen and Augustus John, Ida Nettleship, Ambrose McEvoy and Albert Rutherston, and made many drawings and etchings of her new friends. She won many prizes and certificates for her drawings and in 1897 was awarded a Slade scholarship. Although a couple of oil paintings, painted under Gwen John's guidance, exist, Edna's favoured medium as a painter was watercolour.Still Life of a Basket on a Chair, 1900, collection of the Tate Gallery.

Marriage Early 'Wuthering Heights' drawing showing Catherine Earnshaw on a wall, 1900‚Äì05 Later 'Wuthering Heights' drawing showing Heathcliff supporting the dying Catherine, 1924 The 19-year- old Edna married William Clarke Hall on 22 December 1898. Although he had previously encouraged and supported his wife's studies, there were tensions between Edna's artistic ambitions and her husband's expectation that she conform to a traditional wifely role. For the next two decades, Edna Clarke Hall's art became a very personal activity only shared with close friends and occasionally shown in group exhibitions. Shortly after their marriage, the Clarke Halls rented a sixteenth-century house called 'Great Tomkins' on Upminster Common. This house reminded Edna of Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront√´, inspiring the first of the many illustrations of scenes from the novel that she would create.Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff at Wuthering Heights c.1910‚Äì11 , pen and ink sketch. Tate Gallery, London, accessed 3 February 2012 For the rest of her artistic life Clarke Hall added to the Wuthering Heights drawings and etchings during periods of emotional crisis. They portrayed scenes such as the distraught Catherine crying for the absent HeathcliffCatherine leaning on a wall, 1900‚Äì05, pen and blue wash. Tate Gallery, London, accessed 8 February 2012 and Heathcliff supporting the dying Catherine.Heathcliffe (sic) supporting Catherine, pen, ink and watercolour. Tate Gallery, London, accessed 8 February 2012 One of her drawings of the latter scene was inscribed with the quote ‚ÄòLet me alone! If I've done wrong, I'm dying for it'. Apart from Wuthering Heights, Edna's sons, Justin (b. 1905) and Denis (1910‚Äì2006) were key subjects for her art. She frequently painted them whilst they were otherwise absorbed in their own pursuits, creating tender yet unsentimental portraits, typically in watercolour. In 1914, Henry Tonks persuaded his former pupil to hold a one-woman show at the Chenil Galleries in London. This show was a critical success, with one review describing her as a ‚Äòsensitive and expressive draughtswoman who reaches a masterly plane‚Äô and admiring her ‚Äòindividual and instinctive‚Äô use of colour.J. H. Collins Baker for The Saturday Review, 14 April 1914. Quoted by Alison Thomas, ‚ÄòHall, Edna Clarke , Lady Clarke Hall (1879‚Äì1979)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 3 Feb 2012 Breakdown and artistic identity Edna Clarke Hall suffered a nervous breakdown in 1919. Through the assistance of Tonks and the psychologist Henry Head she addressed some of the problems with her marriage and was able to reassert her artistic identity. In 1922 her husband set up a studio in South Square, Gray's Inn, where she could work. Between 1924 and 1941 she exhibited regularly at the Redfern Gallery in London. Her 1926 show led to The Times's art critic declaring her 'the most imaginative artist in England'.The Times, 9 February 1926. Quoted by Alison Thomas, ‚ÄòHall, Edna Clarke , Lady Clarke Hall (1879‚Äì1979)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 3 Feb 2012 Edna Clarke Hall wrote and published two volumes of poetry, Poems (1926) and Facets (1930). Three of her 'Poem Pictures', which merged illustration and text in a manner reminiscent of William Blake, appear as lithographs in Facets. William Clarke Hall was knighted in 1932 for his work towards reforming child law, at which point his wife became Lady Clarke Hall, but he died later that year.The letters of Ernest Dowson, page 164, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1 Jun 1968. A Trust was formed by Mrs F. Samuel, Mrs. E. Bishop, and Michel H. Salaman, who were mutual friends of the Clarke Halls, to enable Edna to retain her studio and continue working. In 1939 a retrospective of her drawings was held at Manchester. In 1941, Clarke Hall's London studio was destroyed, along with much of her work, by enemy action during the Blitz. Later life and death The loss of her studio was a devastating blow. Clarke Hall gradually painted less and less until ceasing completely in the early 1950s. She lived out the rest of her life with her niece and companion, Mary Fearnley Sander, until her death, aged 100, on 16 November 1979.

There are two types of automated personal assistants: intelligent automated assistants (for example, Apple‚Äôs Siri and Tronton‚Äôs Cluzee), which perform concierge-type tasks (e.g., making dinner reservations, purchasing event tickets, making travel arrangements) or provide information based on voice input or commands; and smart personal agents, which automatically perform management or data-handling tasks based on online information and events often without user initiation or interaction. According to Chi-Hua Chien of Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, examples of tasks that may be performed by a smart personal agent-type of automated personal assistant include schedule management (e.g., sending an alert to a dinner date that a user is running late due to traffic conditions, update schedules for both parties, and change the restaurant reservation time) and personal health management (e.g., monitoring caloric intake, heart rate and exercise regimen, then making recommendations for healthy choices). Both types of automated personal assistant technology are enabled by the combination of mobile computing devices, application programming interfaces (APIs), and the proliferation of mobile apps. However, intelligent automated assistants are designed to perform specific, one-off tasks specified by user voice instructions, while smart personal agents perform ongoing tasks (e.g., schedule management) autonomously.

Roosevelt East River Drive. Along Long Island, the nor'easter destroyed over 130 homes and left 454,000 people without power. In New England, 230,684 people lost power during the storm. Five houses were destroyed in Massachusetts, and flooding reached deep in Boston. Further inland, the storm produced significant snowfall, estimated at around in The Berkshires. The high snow totals closed schools for a week in western Massachusetts. Overall, the storm caused between $1-2 billion in damage (1992 USD) and 19 deaths, of which four were directly related to the storm. In March of the following year, the Storm of the Century caused worse damage across a larger region of the eastern United States. Meteorological history A storm complex moved eastward from the Texas coast into Georgia on December 9. On December 9, the National Weather Service (NWS) issued a coastal flood watch in anticipation of the developing storm. On December 10, an upper-level trough was located along the East Coast of the United States. At around 1200 UTC that day, cyclogenesis - the development of a low pressure area - occurred over southeastern Virginia. The cyclone moved quickly northward through the Chesapeake Bay until reaching a position just west of Chestertown, Maryland on December 11. By that time, the system had intensified to a pressure of , while the parent trough extended from Maryland through the New York metropolitan area to around Cape Cod. On December 11, the NWS issued gale warnings and advised for boats to avoid the ocean. The storm turned to the southeast and briefly stalled near Georgetown, Delaware. This was due to a high pressure area north of Maine halting its motion. The interaction between the two systems produced strong easterly winds from Virginia to New England. The nor'easter finally moved offshore on December 12, and later that day passed to the southeast of Long Island. Impact The storm affected a large region of the northeastern United States from West Virginia to Massachusetts with heavy snowfall, sleet, rain, and high winds. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention attributed four deaths to the nor'easter, but only included those directly related; the agency did not include storm-induced traffic accidents or heart attacks. The National Climatic Data Center reported 19 deaths related to the nor'easter, although news reports shortly after the storm reported 20 deaths. Overall damage was estimated between $1-2 billion (1992 USD), mostly in New England. The storm's widespread snowfall ranked it as the equivalence of a Category 2, or \\"significant\\", on the Regional Snowfall Index scale. =Mid-Atlantic= In the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia, the nor'easter dropped over of snow. Officials restricted travel on roads to emergency vehicles only in the state's two easternmost counties. In the state, the storm left 15,000 people without power. In northern Virginia, of snow stranded 2,500 people in Winchester. In western Maryland, snowfall totals unofficially reached in Garrett County. If verified, the total would have been the highest snowfall amount in the state's history. High winds produced up to snow drifts, which stranded trucks on Interstate 68. High winds knocked down trees and power lines, leaving 120,000 people across the state without power, including some without any heat. At least 10 people required rescue from their homes. In the Washington Metropolitan Area, the mixture of rain and snow caused hundreds of traffic accidents. The nor'easter struck about 14 months after the 1991 Perfect Storm produced similarly high tides across the region, and only 11 months after another nor'easter in January 1992. In Wilmington, North Carolina, the storm dropped of rainfall, which broke the daily rainfall record set in 1888. High tides damaged much of the dune system along the Assateague Island National Seashore and about a third of the newly installed dunes in Ocean City, Maryland. Along the Maryland coast, the storm dropped heavy rainfall, with a total of in Salisbury; the high rains flooded local streams. At Assateague National Seashore, wind gusts peaked at . The storm struck shortly after a full moon, and the combination of high tides and waves breached dunes in some locations. Despite its longevity, the nor'easter was less severe than its predecessors along the Delaware Bay, mostly because the stronger northeast quadrant was over the coastline for one tidal cycle, and the predominant southeast winds were blocked by Cape Henlopen. However, there were still high tides and flooding along the Delaware Bay. In Lewes, the nor'easter produced a high tide of , which at the time was the seventh highest on record. High tides continued in Delaware until December 15\\\\. Several days of high tides caused minor beach erosion and damaged dune systems. In Dewey Beach, there was property damage from coastal flooding. The storm produced significantly more rainfall than the storm in January 1992, including a total of in Wilmington, Delaware. A station in New Castle County reported a record 24‚Äëhour rainfall total of . The rains caused flooding and the third highest discharge on record at Duck Creek in Smyrna. Wind in Delaware peaked at at a station along the Indian River. Further north along the Delaware River, a high tide of was reported in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. High winds in the city broke the steeple of a church, and the resulting debris briefly closed the Ben Franklin Bridge. Hurricane-force wind gusts left about 160,000 residents without power. Heavy snowfall spread across the state, reaching . State College reported a total of , which contributed to its snowiest December on record. In contrast to Delaware and Maryland, the strong northeast portion of the nor'easter affected New Jersey for several days, producing strong winds and record high tides. Wind gusts reached in Cape May, which were the strongest winds in association with the storm. Sustained winds were around in the region. High winds in Atlantic City destroyed the windows of storefronts. Along the Jersey coast, the nor'easter produced waves of up to in height. About offshore Long Branch, waves reached heights of . In South Jersey, the storm surge struck the coast near low tide, which restricted flooding. The highest tide in South Jersey was in Ocean City, which broke the previous record of set in 1984. Further north, the surge coincided with several days of high tides and a lunar tide, causing significant flooding and beach erosion. The highest tide was in Perth Amboy along the Raritan River, which broke the record set in 1960. In many locations, the storm produced the highest tides since the Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962. The storm also dropped rainfall across the state, peaking at in Morristown, along with gusts peaking at 58 mph (93 km/h) at Morristown Municipal Airport. The rainfall caused higher discharge rates along rivers. The storm also produced high snowfall totals, including in Sussex County. Throughout the coastline, the cost to replace the lost beach from erosion was estimated at $300 million (1992 USD). Most of the impact in New Jersey was from the high tides, which caused the worst flooding in 30 years in some locations. In Hoboken, high tides flooded portions of the New York City Subway and Port Authority Trans-Hudson systems, leaving them closed for a few days. High tides destroyed portions of the boardwalks in Bradley Beach and Belmar, and also destroyed a century-old fishing pier in Ocean Grove. Flooding closed portions of roads across North Jersey, including the Garden State Parkway near Cheesequake State Park and six state highways. At Newark International Airport, dozens of flights were canceled. The storm left 102,000 customers of Jersey Central Power & Light without power. Damage to short circuits caused house fires in Monmouth County. Damage was heaviest near Raritan, Newark, and Sandy Hook along Raritan Bay. High winds in Jersey City destroyed the roof of an apartment; the debris struck and killed a woman walking along a nearby sidewalk. Throughout the state, the nor'easter damaged about 3,200 homes, primarily in Monmouth and Ocean counties, and caused an estimated $750 million in damage (1992 USD). Then-governor Jim Florio declared a state of emergency and activated the New Jersey National Guard. About 19,000 people were evacuated in six towns in Monmouth County. Statewide, about 2,000 people in 20 towns had to be evacuated by helicopter or National Guard truck. The American Red Cross opened at least 30 shelters across the state, housing over 5,000 people affected by floods or lack of heat. Damage in the state was less than the nor'easter of 1962 due to 30 years of disaster mitigation, including beach replenishment, dune construction, and improved building codes. =New York and New England= Before the storm's circulation passed the New York area, its associated trough produced sustained easterly winds of 50 mph (80 km/h) along Long Island. Wind gusts reached 77 mph (124 km/h) at LaGuardia Airport. The strong easterly winds produced high tides in the region that increased gradually after three consecutive tidal cycles; this was due to the nor'easter's slow movement. There was a storm surge of about 3 ft (1 m) at Battery Park at the southern end of Manhattan. The same station reported a high tide of above sea level, which was high enough to surpass the sea walls for a few hours. The ensuing flooding submerged portions of Franklin D. Roosevelt East River Drive to about 4 ft (1.5 m) deep. At least 50 cars were stuck, and some drivers required rescue. Low-lying neighborhoods of New York City were also flooded. High waves canceled Staten Island Ferry service. A power outage closed the New York City Subway system for about five hours. The highest tide in Long Island was at Willets Point, Queens. The tides and flooding decreased after the winds shifted to the north, ending on December 14. High tides canceled ferry service to Fire Island, and the only bridge onto the island was closed to all but emergency personnel and homeowners. High waves washed away dunes and severely eroded beaches along the island, destroying over 100 summer homes. On nearby Westhampton Beach, 30 homes were destroyed, and about 100 houses were isolated due to two new inlets created during the storm. Flooding closed all three bridges connecting Long Beach Island to the mainland. Flooding up to forced about 3,000 people to evacuate from one village on northern Long Island. About 700 homes were damaged in Bayville along the north coast. High winds downed trees and power lines, leaving more than 454,000 Long Island Lighting Company customers without power. In Mamaroneck to the northeast of New York City, a man drowned after being swept away by floodwaters. In the Albany area, where the storm was known as the Downslope Nor'easter, there was little snow accumulation during the storm's closest approach due to above freezing temperatures. After the storm moved by the region and the winds shifted to the north, about fell in the city. To the west of Albany in the Helderberg Escarpment and the Catskill Mountains, snowfall totals reached . Heavy snowfall spread across the state, including a total of in Niagara Falls. In Connecticut , local TV stations named the storm Beth. Across the region, the Northeast Utilities power company reported that 230,684 customers lost electricity during the storm, although all outages were restored within three days. In Connecticut, the nor'easter produced a storm surge of about 3 ft (1 m), and a high tide of 7.2 ft (2.2 m) was reported in Bridgeport. This was the highest tide since Hurricane Carol in 1954. The rising tides killed one man in the state, and there was also one fatality in neighboring Rhode Island. Along Cape Cod, waves eroded beaches, and evacuations were recommended in two cities. The storm destroyed severely damaged two houses and destroyed six houses on Nantucket http://www.weatherknowledge.com/The_Great_NorEaster_of_Dec_1992.pdf and one in Plymouth. During the storm, more than 20 pilot whales were beached along the cape, of which seven died. Boston reported a peak tide of , which was less than the record set in 1978. The high tides caused up to of flooding. The nor'easter produced of snowfall in a 24 period to the west of the city. Further west, snowfall totals reached around in The Berkshires, which created snow drifts. The high accumulations closed schools for a week in the Berkshires, and the cities required National Guard assistance to remove the snow. To the west of the Berkshires, strong east winds prevented significant snow accumulation in valleys. High tides extended as far north as Portland, Maine, which reported a peak of . Aftermath On December 17, President George H. W. Bush declared three Connecticut counties as disaster areas. The next day, the president declared 12 New Jersey counties as disaster areas, including all of the counties along the Atlantic coast. The declaration allowed for $46 million in relief for public damages and $265 million for insured damage in the state. On December 21, the president declared 9 Massachusetts counties and 5 New York counties as disaster areas. On January 15, 1993, Sussex County, Delaware was also declared a disaster area. Across the nor'easter's path, 25,142 people received assistance from Federal Emergency Management Agency, equating to $346,150,356 in federal aid. Only three months after the nor'easter struck, another nor'easter caused more severe damage across a larger region of the eastern United States. The March nor'easter, known as the Storm of the Century, killed 310 people and left over $1.5 billion in damage (1993 USD).

Lynching Francis L. McIntosh, aged twenty-six, of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, who worked as a porter and a cook on the steamboat Flora, arrived in St. Louis on April 28. McIntosh departed the boat in the morning to visit an African-American chambermaid who worked aboard the Lady Jackson, which had docked the same day. According to the captain of the Flora, as McIntosh departed the boat, two police officers were chasing another sailor (who had been involved in a fight) and requested McIntosh's assistance in stopping him. McIntosh did not assist the officers, and he was arrested for interfering in the apprehension. In the second version of events, the two sailors had been drinking and had insulted the officers, and McIntosh refused to assist in arresting the pair. According to St. Louis: An Informal History of the City and Its People, Deputy Constable William Mull arrested McIntosh the afternoon of the 28th for helping two Flora deckhands escape from Mull's custody. On their way to jail, the two met George Hammond, deputy sheriff, who assisted Mull in escorting McIntosh to jail. When charged with breach of the peace by a justice of the peace, McIntosh asked the two arresting officers how long he would have to remain in jail. One told him that he would serve five years in prison for the crime, and McIntosh then stabbed both officers, killing one and seriously injuring the other. McIntosh then fled down Market Street to Walnut, scaled a garden fence, and hid in an outhouse. A man in the crowd that had gathered outside smashed in the door, knocked down McIntosh, and took his knife. The crowd then took McIntosh to jail, where Sheriff James Brotherton locked him up. A white mob soon broke into the jail and removed McIntosh. The mob then took him to the outskirts of town (near the present-day intersection of Seventh and Chestnut streets in Downtown St. Louis), chained him to a locust tree, and piled wood around and up to his knees. When the mob lit the wood with a hot brand, McIntosh asked the crowd to shoot him, then began to sing hymns. When one in the crowd said that he had died, McIntosh reportedly replied, \\"No, no -- I feel as much as any of you. Shoot me! Shoot me!\\" After at most twenty minutes, McIntosh died. Estimates for the number present at the lynching range in the hundreds, and include an alderman who threatened to shoot anyone who attempted to stop the lynching. During the night, an elderly African-American man was paid to keep the fire lit, and the mob dispersed. The next day, on April 29, a group of boys threw rocks at the corpse in an attempt to break the skull. When a grand jury was convened to investigate the lynching on May 16, overseen by Judge Luke E. Lawless, most local newspapers and the presiding judge encouraged no indictment for the crime, and no one was ever charged or convicted. Judge Lawless stated in his charge to the jury that if individuals could be found guilty, they should be prosecuted. However, he suggested no judicial action if this was a mass phenomenon. The judge also remarked in court that McIntosh's actions were an example of the \\"atrocities committed in this and other states by individuals of negro blood against their white brethren,\\" and that with the rise of abolitionism, \\"the free negro has been converted into a deadly enemy.\\" The jury was also misinformed by the judge that McIntosh was a pawn of local abolitionists, particularly Elijah Lovejoy, the publisher of a known abolitionist newspaper. Many in the East and St. Louis itself condemned Judge Lawless' actions during the trial. Aftermath In the weeks after the lynching, several abolitionists condemned the events, including newspaper editor Elijah Lovejoy. Lovejoy ran the abolitionist, temperance, and anti- Catholic newspaper, St. Louis Observer. The Observer header on May 5, 1836 suggested that the lynching of McIntosh effectively ended the rule of Law and Constitution in St. Louis. As a result of mob pressure, Lovejoy was forced to move from St. Louis to Alton, Illinois, where he was shot and killed while defending his printing press from a mob in November 1837. One New York abolitionist newspaper, The Emancipator, noted that \\"the circumstances attending the burning of a negro alive, at the West, are known.... The Spaniards may have murdered monks by the score, the Mexicans may have shot prisoners by the dozen, but roasting alive before a slow fire is a practice nowhere except among free, enlightened, high-minded Americans.\\" In January 1838, future President Abraham Lincoln used the lynching as an example in his address at the Lyceum. No other state legislator in Illinois or Missouri condemned the mob action. Shortly after the lynching, a St. Louis newspaper, the Missouri Republican, noted that abolitionists were attempting to gather McIntosh's remains in an effort to bring them to the Eastern United States, as a symbol of the evils of slavery. In the years following the lynching, visitors to the city (often from McIntosh's home town of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) frequented the tree and removed parts of it as memorial keepsakes.

He was assistant tutor at Te Rau Kahikatea Theological College from 1898 to 1908. In 1899 he was appointed editor of the Anglican church newspaper Te Pipiwharauroa. On 14 December 1904 he married Keita Paratene, daughter of Paratene Tatae and Sarah \\"Hera\\" Halbert. Sarah was the daughter of Thomas Halbert, one of the founding fathers of Gisborne, and Kaikiri (who would later anglicise her name to Keita). Sarah was also the sister of Kate Wyllie (n√©e Halbert) and half-sister of Wi Pere and Otene Pitau. Her children also included All Blacks rugby players, William \\"Bill\\" Cunningham and Moana Paratene. He was ordained as a deacon in 1907, and was appointed to Kawakawa, near East Cape. He was ordained as a priest in 1910. He also studied for the examinations of the Board of Theological Studies and in 1911 was awarded the Licentiate in Theology (LTh) in 1911. In addition to his pastoral duties, he worked with his brothers on the family farm, as well as continuing to contribute to newspapers. He contested one general election; in , he agreed to be the official Labour Party candidate in the electorate, and he came second after National's ƒÄpirana Ngata. Literature Kohere annually contributed to the MƒÅori magazine Te Ao Hou (The New World) during its early years. Since the publication was printed bilingually (Te Reo MƒÅori and English), Kohere submitted Ngati Porou poetry with his own translations. One example is \\"Te Oriori a Hinekitawhiti mo tana Mokopuna mo Ahuahukiterangi/Hine-ki-tawhiti‚Äôs Oriori.\\" The translation resulted in the poem possessing an ornate style comparable to English poets Burns and Tennyson. Sir ƒÄpirana Ngata, a contemporary and whanaunga of Kohere, supplied his own translation of the oriori in NgƒÅ M≈çteatea: The Songs ‚Äì Part I. Ngata mentions that his version opted to be, \\"faithful to the original Maori, thereby sacrificing the ornate to the literal.\\" While both translations ultimately deliver the same material, their stylistic choices result in two different experiences: Ngata's blunt usage of simple language is far more accessibale when compared to Kohere's archaic English; although, Kohere's version requires a level of engagement from the reader that is absent in Ngata's. In the Spring issue of the same year, Kohere's final contribution to the magazine would be published, \\"He Waiata A Hinetawhirirangi/Hinetawhirirangi‚Äôs Song\\". He also received a tribute in the \\"Haere ki o koutou tipuna\\" section, where his often uncredited involvement in the Young MƒÅori Party was mentioned. The magazine would make continual references to the late writer in its subsequent issues, even years later, showing his impact on the readers and editors. Kohere's final years also saw him publish works incredibly important for the eponymous whanau: The Story of a Maori Chief; and, The Autobiography of a Maori.

Summary Basic taste qualities like sour, salty, sweet, bitter and umami serve specific functions in identifying food components found in the diet of humans and animals, and are recognized by proteins in the oral cavity. Recognition of bitter taste and aversion to it are thought to protect the organism against the ingestion of poisonous food compounds, which are often bitter. Bitter taste receptors are expressed not only in the mouth but also in extraoral tissues. BitterDB database, available at http://bitterdb.agri.huji.ac.il/bitterdb/, includes over 670 compounds that were reported to taste bitter to humans. The compounds can be searched by name, chemical structure, similarity to other bitter compounds, association with a particular human bitter taste receptor, and so on. The database also contains information on mutations in bitter taste receptors that were shown to influence receptor activation by bitter compounds. Database overview =Bitter compounds= Search Examples of bitter compounds in BitterDB BitterDB currently contains more than 670 compounds that were cited in the literature as bitter. For each compound, the database offers information regarding its molecular properties, references for the compound‚Äôs bitterness, including additional information about the bitterness category of the compound (e.g. a ‚Äòbitter-sweet‚Äô or ‚Äòslightly bitter‚Äô annotation), different compound identifiers (smiles, CAS registry number, IUPAC systematic name), an indication whether the compound is derived from a natural source or is synthetic, a link to the compound‚Äôs PubChem entry and different file formats for downloading (sdf, image, smiles). Over 200 bitter compounds have been experimentally linked to their corresponding human bitter taste receptors. For those compounds, BitterDB provides additional information, including links to the publications indicating these ligand‚Äìreceptor interactions, the effective concentration for receptor activation and/or the EC50 value and links to the associated bitter taste receptors entries in the BitterDB. Querying and browsing Bitter compounds can be queried and browsed in different ways. For example, 'advanced search' option allows user to retrieve compounds that fit different criteria, such as a combination of specific physical properties or a combination of associated human bitter taste receptors. In addition to the querying options the user can browse through a sort-able table with all the BitterDB compounds. =Bitter taste receptors= In addition, BitterDB contains data about the 25 known human bitter taste receptors. Several properties are displayed for each receptor. The bitter taste receptors can be searched using different criteria: name, known ligands and UniProt accession number. Using a table that presents all the bitter taste receptors and some information about them, the user can browse and also sort by various options, such as the number of bitter ligands associated with the receptor. =Local BLAST service and global alignment= BitterDB offers two additional features: a local BLAST service to determine the local similarity between a query sequence and the different human bitter taste receptors, and a global alignment of the 25 human bitter taste receptors. The alignment was generated using ClustalW2, and displays the secondary structure of each receptor, as predicted by the TOPCONS server. =Users can upload bitter compounds= BitterDB offers an ‚Äòupload‚Äô option, by which the users are encouraged to submit information about bitter compounds. These data will be reviewed by the authors and uploaded to the database accordingly. The users can join the mailing list in order to receive database updates.

Life and career Eisinger started playing the piano at the age of seven. At eleven he continued his studies under the tutelage of the pianist Walter Krafft (* in 1936 in Bucharest), a pupil of Florica Musicescu (1887‚Äì1969) who had also taught Dinu Lipatti (1917‚Äì1950). In 1967 Krafft founded the Munich Musikseminar and has since then been its director. He was to become Eisinger's most important mentor at the piano, and it was thanks to him that Eisinger went on to perform his first recital and his first concerto with an orchestra at the age of thirteen in Munich. From 1976 on Eisinger studied under Professor Erik Then-Bergh (1916‚Äì1978) at the Munich Musikhochschule, passing his Staatsexamen (state examination) with distinction in 1980. In 1986 he won a scholarship to the Cit√© internationale des arts in Paris. By then, he had already - at the age of fourteen - made his first recordings in the studios of the Bavarian Broadcasting Corporation (Bayerischer Rundfunk), and at 16 he cut his first record, playing, amongst other things, Ludwig van Beethoven's Path√©tique sonata and the Variations s√©rieuses by Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy. After graduating, he began travelling widely on the concert circuit both at home and abroad. Notable among his many appearances was his performance of Johann Sebastian Bach's complete Well Tempered Clavier in Munich, Vienna, Salzburg, and Klagenfurt. He put in appearances at Menton, Paris, Montpellier, at the Kissinger Sommer (summer festival in Bad Kissingen/Germany), the Richard Strauss Festival in Garmisch-Partenkirchen and the Kod√°ly Festival in Kecskem√©t, Hungary. There were also five concert tours in South Africa. A significant landmark in Eisinger's career was his performance of Robert Schumann's Carnaval at the M√ºnchner Klaviersommer (Munich piano summer festival) of 1990. The soloist in the second half of the concert was Friedrich Gulda. Following this, he gave his d√©but performance at the Berliner Philharmonie with Mendelssohn's G minor Piano Concerto and went on to give piano recitals in several European capitals, in Toronto/Canada and in San Francisco/USA. A number of recordings for radio and television followed, as well as CD productions, which included some of the great cycles in the repertoire of major works for the piano. Eisinger has also been involved in chamber music performances and has appeared as accompanist to performers of the German Lied, notably Hermann Prey and Kieth Engen. He has fascinated audiences with his Gespr√§chskonzerte (musical lectures, or lecture recitals) in which he introduces and elucidates each work before playing it. The audience are then suitably prepared, so that the performance itself becomes a deep and lasting experience for them, something which has proved particularly helpful with longer works such as Bach's Goldberg Variations, or Beethoven's Diabelli Variations, and a cycle of his 32 Piano Sonatas. A lecture recital at the Villa Wahnfried in 2002 turned out to be the start of a seven-year career at the Bayreuth Richard Wagner Festival. There, from 2002 to 2008, Eisinger performed introductions to all Wagner's operas at matin√©e recitals, with the result that he was invited to appear at a number of other opera houses both in Germany and abroad. In 2008 he was hired for a period of several years to provide musical introductions in the same vein at the Richard Wagner Festival at Wels in Austria. Eisinger's interpretations, while reflecting his own ideals and feelings, remain true to the spirit of the work itself. For him, to convey the spirit and intention of the composer as naturally as possible is paramount. At present, Eisinger ist working on recordings of all the Beethoven piano sonatas. He is the first pianist to give an introduction to each sonata and to elucidate it using musical illustrations and quotations, before playing it. He is also involved in making recordings of his introductory lectures of all the Wagner operas along the lines of his matin√©e recitals in Bayreuth.

She was a prominent figure in early Wanganui and New Plymouth as a founder of schools in both districts. She was a talented gardener and schoolteacher. Life The taua, a large forest-tree, drawn by King in 1842 Martha King was born in Ireland. She emigrated to New Zealand in December 1840, arriving at Wellington on board the barque London. She travelled with her eldest sister, Maria, and her brother, Samuel Popham King. From Wellington, the Kings sailed to Wanganui on board the Elizabeth, arriving on 27 February 1841, and became foundation settlers of the new town. They had purchased a section of the land acquired by Colonel William Wakefield for the New Zealand Company. Samuel King built two houses, and Martha King and her sister opened Wanganui's first school soon afterward. One source claims the school was popular, with the sisters balancing discipline and kindness well. In December 1847, the King family moved to New Plymouth, sailing on board the Ralph Bernal. King opened a school with her sister, Maria, and her sister-in- law, Mary Jane King, while living in New Plymouth. This venue was also used for other functions, such as cultural activities, which reflected the Kings' prominent presence in New Plymouth's public life. King died at her New Plymouth home on 31 May 1897, aged 94 years.  Work  A watercolour of New Zealand rata by King, dated 1842 King was one of the early British and Irish settlers who turned to botanical illustration to \\"eke out a livelihood in rough conditions\\". In September 1842, King was commissioned by the Wellington Horticultural and Botanical Society to prepare two sets of drawings of interesting indigenous botanical specimens, one to be forwarded to the directors of the New Zealand Company, and the other to the London Horticultural Society. Exactly why King was chosen for this commission is unknown. The first set of 40 watercolours was completed by January 1843, reaching the New Zealand Company in London in September 1843; it was acquired by the Alexander Turnbull Library in 1981. The second set has disappeared without trace. In 1845, four of King's lithographs appeared in Edward Jerningham Wakefield's Illustrations to Adventures in New Zealand. Apart from the botanical watercolours, all that remains of King's work are 16 pencil sketches depicting scenes of Wellington, Wanganui and New Plymouth, dated between 1841 and 1859. Although King later exhibited at the Sydney International Exhibition of 1879, no other examples of her work are known to have survived.

Born in Christchurch, King worked in surveying and farming before he became a professional soldier in New Zealand's Permanent Forces in 1910. He volunteered for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force following the outbreak of World War One. After participating in the Gallipoli Campaign, he was selected by the commander of the newly formed New Zealand Division, Major General Russell, for command of the New Zealand Pioneer Battalion on the Western Front. King later commanded a battalion in the Canterbury Infantry Regiment and was killed in action during the Battle of Passchendaele in 1917. Early life King, the son of a merchant, was born in Christchurch, New Zealand on 3 March 1885. Following his schooling at Warwick House School and then Christ's College, he worked as a shepherd. He later performed surveying work in the Hawke's Bay before working on his father's sheep farm in Nelson. Military career Having always had an interest in the military, King decided to make it his profession and joined the New Zealand Permanent Forces in 1910, having previously served with the local Cadet Corps and militia. Commissioned as a lieutenant in the New Zealand Staff Corps, he was posted to Hamilton as adjutant of the 4th (Waikato) Mounted Rifles. =World War One= Following the outbreak of World War One, King volunteered for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force and embarked for the Middle East in October 1914. He was appointed staff captain to the then Colonel Andrew Russell, commander of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade. The brigade was initially based in Egypt and did not participate in the 25 April 1915 landings at Gallipoli which marked the start of the Gallipoli campaign. The following month, King and the brigade moved to the Gallipoli peninsula to fight as infantry. During the August offensive King, having been promoted to major, commanded the Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment, and was wounded on 27 August during a battle for Hill 60. Evacuated from Gallipoli, King was appointed to the Distinguished Service Order for his \\"distinguished service in the field\\"Haigh & Polaschek, 1993, p. 139 during the campaign. After recovering from his wounds, in February 1916 King was appointed commander of the New Zealand Pioneer Battalion. The battalion was part of the New Zealand Division then being formed by Russell (now a major general) in Egypt following the withdrawal of Allied forces from Gallipoli. The battalion was a mix of personnel and included the survivors of the Otago Mounted Rifles, men of the MƒÅori contingents as well as Pacific Islanders. King, well regarded by Russell, set about merging the various elements of the battalion, many of whom were not particularly happy at losing the identity of their parent formations, into an effective unit.Pugsley, 2006, p. 45 The battalion embarked for the Western Front after two months training. Although intended as labour force for preparing trenches and the like, the battalion also conducted trench raids in the early stages of its tenure in the trenches although these were unsuccessful. The battalion was based in the Somme where it would construct communication trenches in preparation for the Battle of the Somme. One trench, called Turk Lane and which King was particularly proud of, was approximately two kilometres long. Under King's leadership, the battalion quickly gained a reputation for its quality work, its digging exploits earning the battalion the nickname of Diggers (this nickname would soon be extended to the New Zealand Division and the Australian Divisions also became known by this nickname as well).Pugsley, 2006, pp. 55-56 King's distinguished work with the battalion would later be recognised with the gazetting in January 1918 of a bar to his DSO. New Zealand Pioneer Battalion soldiers at the funeral of Lieutenant-Colonel King at Ypres, Belgium The battalion shifted north to Belgium in early 1917, and began work preparing the necessary infrastructure for the forthcoming Battle of Messines. For a month from early July, it was attached to the New Zealand Rifle Brigade, which was temporarily part of the French First Army. During this period, it was based in the area around Ypres, constructing roads and trenches.Pugsley, 2006, pp. 64-65 For his service during this brief attachment to the French Army, King was awarded the Croix de Guerre. In late August 1917, King was appointed commander of 1st Battalion, Canterbury Infantry Regiment. He would be in command of the battalion for just over a month. Having led the battalion during the Battle of Broodseinde and in the early stages of the Battle of Passchendaele in October, he was killed during an artillery barrage on his battalion headquarters on 12 October during the First Battle of Passchendaele. Highly regarded by those under his command, he was buried in Ypres. MƒÅori soldiers of the New Zealand Pioneer Battalion performed a waiata tangi, normally reserved for high-ranking chiefs, during his funeral.Pugsley, 2006, p. 67 King was survived by his wife Annie, whom he married in 1910, and two children, Edward and Nancy. Andrew Russell, King's former commanding officer, would assist in the education of his children. Edward later became a group captain in the Royal New Zealand Air Force.Vennell, 2011, p. 302 Notes References  Category:1885 births Category:1917 deaths Category:New Zealand farmers Category:People from Christchurch Category:New Zealand military personnel killed in World War I Category:New Zealand Companions of the Distinguished Service Order ","title":"George Augustus King"},{"id":"34592069","text":"Wiremu Tamihana; photograph by Kinder, January 1863 John Kinder (17 September 1819 5 September 1903) was a New Zealand Anglican clergyman, teacher, artist and photographer. Kinder was born in London, United Kingdom, on 17 September 1819, the oldest surviving child of a wealthy merchant and his second wife. In 1838 Kinder attended Cambridge University originally studying Mathematics but Classics and Theology were where his true interests lay. He graduated in 1845 with a MA. While at Cambridge he joined the Cambridge Camden Society which was a group interested in church architecture. Kinder received his Anglican priesthood in 1845 and became an ordained deacon in 1846. In 1848, Kinder was the new Master at Alleyne's Grammar School where he remained for eight years. However, after he was petitioned to be removed from his post due to his strict religious practices, he was interviewed by Bishop G. A Selwyn to relocate to Auckland, New Zealand to be the headmaster of the Church of England Grammar School. Kinder began his journey to New Zealand in July 1855. He moved into the headmasters house across the road from the school which is now a heritage site known as Kinder House. During the New Zealand Land Wars of the 1860s, Kinder was a Chaplain to the British Forces. In 1872, Kinder became the Master of St John's College in Tamaki. Kinder received a Doctor of Divinity in 1873 by the Archbishop of Canterbury. In December 1859, at Te Papa in Tauranga, Kinder married Marianne Celia Brown. The couple had no children of their own, but they adopted Kinder's youngest brother's children after he was murdered in 1865. While most of Kinder's life was devoted to theology and education, he became known after his death as an artist and photographer. Most of his work centred around landscape and architectural portraits. He is particularly known for his water colour paintings. One of his most well known photographic works was the portrait of Wiremu Tamihana, which was used as the front cover of the 1864 book, The Maori King by John Gorst. Kinder's photographs of Parnell in the 1860s have been preserved as a historical record of colonial Auckland. His works as an artist and photographer have only been exhibited on a few occasions. They were first shown in 1871 and again 1873 by the Auckland Society of Artists of which Kinder was a founding member. Kinder died on 5 September 1903, aged 83, in Remuera, Auckland, and was buried at St John's College. The John Kinder Theological Library is the library and archives for St John's College as well as for the Anglican Church in Aotearoa New Zealand and Polynesia. From September 2013 to April 2014, Kinder was the subject of an exhibition at the Auckland Art Gallery titled Kinder's Presence. A topographical map of Auckland which Kinder drew is now held in the Hocken Library in Dunedin.

After performing in the chorus at the Moulin Rouge and other theatres in Paris from the age of 14, she became a chorus girl in Edwardian musical comedies, briefly on Broadway in 1905, then in London for several years and back in Paris in 1912. She got her big break in 1913, when she was offered a leading role in a revue presented by the impresario C B Cochran. The show was a hit and established Delysia as a star. During World War I, she starred in a string of West End revues and an operetta, all of which consolidated her success. In the star vehicle Afgar, from 1919 to 1921, first in London, then New York and on tour in the U.S., Delysia's fame was at its height, and her lively performance was celebrated by the critics. Returning to London in 1922, Delysia fell ill and was forced to withdraw temporarily from the stage. From 1924, she was again starring in revues, including the successful 1925 London show On With the Dance, which helped to establish No√´l Coward's fame. Another highlight, in 1926, was Princess Charming. In the later 1920s and the 1930s she played in a range of musical theatre and, increasingly, in non-musical comic plays in London, earning further critical accolades. During the Second World War she abandoned the West End and devoted herself to entertaining British and allied troops, marrying a naval officer in the Free French Forces. After the war, she retired completely, accompanying her diplomat husband on various overseas postings. She returned to England in her last years.

She moved to London, where she continued to appear on the stage until 1909, when she temporarily abandoned the theatrical profession.

In 1912 they parted, and she returned to France, resuming her theatrical career in Paris, in, among other shows, a French translation of The Quaker Girl.\\"Delysia Alice\\", Encyclopedia of Popular Music. Ed. Colin Larkin. Muze Inc and Oxford University Press, 2009 , accessed 3 February 2012 In 1913, Delysia was spotted by the English impresario C B Cochran, who saw her playing a small role at the Olympia variety theatre in Paris. He was planning to stage intimate Parisian-style revue in London, and he offered Delysia ¬£6 a week to appear for him in London.Short and Compton-Rickett, p. 256 He gave her the starring role in his first revue in 1914, Odds and Ends, by Harry Grattan at the Ambassadors Theatre. Cochran's biographer James Harding writes that Odds and Ends \\"set the standard of all his subsequent revues: beautiful dresses, taste, wit, elegance, brightness, and colour.\\"Harding, James. \\"Cochran, Sir Charles Blake (1872‚Äì1951)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, May 2005, accessed 3 February 2012 The Times called the show \\"a pleasant piece of nonsense and sense combined\\",\\"A Play About Louvain\\", The Times, 17 October 1914, p. 11 The revue was originally the final part of a triple bill. The Daily Express commented on the first item: The censor, the Lord Chamberlain, hastened to see the show, and demanded changes.\\"Shocked the Censor\\", Daily Mirror, 23 October 1914, p. 2 After an uncertain start, the revue was a huge success; the song \\"We don't want to lose you, but we think you ought to go\\", encouraging young men to join the army, was a particular hit for Delysia. Within weeks the other items in the triple bill were dropped, and Odds and Ends was expanded to a full evening, with only a brief curtain raiser.\\"Dramatis Personae\\", The Observer, 27 December 1914, p. 4 Within two months of the opening, Delysia was an established star, invited to take part with Muriel Foster, Charles Hawtrey, Oscar Asche and Isidore de Lara in a charity matin√©e attended by Queen Alexandra.\\"Court Circular\\", The Times, 10 December 1914, p. 11 It was the first of many charity appearances that Delysia made during the war. Her biographer Anne Pimlott Baker writes that Delysia entertained wounded troops, and took many French refugees and orphans into her home. In 1916, she made her film d√©but, and took a leading role in SHE, an adaptation of the Rider Haggard story, about a woman's passion for a young traveller.\\"SHE\\", British Film Institute, accessed 13 February 2012 =West End star= C. B. Cochran in 1916 Delysia was the star of the two further revues that Cochran staged at the Ambassadors, More, in 1915, again by Grattan, and Pell Mell by Fred Thompson and Morris Harvey in 1916. The authors of the latter announced that their show not only possessed no plot, but was \\"fully as coherent played backwards as it was played forwards.\\"Short and Compton-Rickett, p. 257 It was nonetheless successful, and further enhanced Delysia's status. She had by now moved from earning ¬£6 a week to ¬£100. In 1917 Cochran decided that the Ambassadors was too small to accommodate his planned productions, and he moved to the Prince of Wales Theatre, which with 1,000 seats had more than twice the capacity of the Ambassadors. He temporarily forsook revue and mounted an operetta, Carminetta, with music by Emile Lassailly, Herman Finck and Herman Darewski and libretto by Andr√© Barde and C A Carpentier.\\"Carminetta\\", The Observer, 26 August 1917, p. 5; and \\"Carminetta at the Prince of Wales's\\", Manchester Guardian, 24 August 1917, p. 6 It starred Delysia in the title role as the passionate but prim daughter of Carmen and Don Jos√©. The Observer commented, \\"Mlle. Delysia raved and stormed and languished indefatigably in beads and short skirts.\\" Delysia was not a trained singer, and nor were several other members of the cast; some critics commented on that fact, but it did not affect box-office business. The show ran from 23 August 1917 to 23 March 1918, transferring to the Garrick Theatre for the latter stages of the run.\\"Theatres\\", The Times, 23 March 1918, p. 6 After the run of Carminetta, Delysia returned to revue in As You Were, by Herman Darewski and Arthur Wimperis, adapted from a French revue, Plus √ßa change.\\"As You Were\\", The Observer, 4 August 1918, p. 6 It opened in August 1918 at the London Pavilion, newly refurbished by Cochran (\\"transformed almost beyond recognition\\", according to The Observer). The show was structured around Delysia, giving her the chance to shine in a succession of roles including Ninon de l'Enclos, Helen of Troy, Elizabeth I, and Cleopatra. She also appeared as Lucifer, once again coming to the attention of the Lord Chamberlain for the skin-tight black costume in which she appeared. The Morning Post commented, \\"Never can an actress have worn so negligible a dress\\".\\"Morality in Stage Costume\\", The Daily Express, 9 October 1918, p.2 =Post-war= Cochran's, and Delysia's, first new show after the war was Afgar by Fred Thompson and Worton David with music by Charles Cuvillier, which opened at the Pavilion in September 1919. It was an extravagant musical comedy set in a Moorish harem, with Delysia as Zaydee, who heads a harem strike leading to general monogamy.\\"Afgar ‚Äì Extravaganza at the Pavilion\\", The Times, 18 September 1919, p. 8 Of her performance, The Times said: Delysia in Mayfair and Montmartre, 1922 The show ran in London for 300 performances, after which Delysia sailed to New York at the end of 1920 for the Broadway production at the Central Theatre, for which she was paid ¬£2,500 a week, a prodigious sum at that time.\\"Alice Delysia in C.B.Cochran‚Äôs production 'Mayfair and Montmartre'\\", Victoria and Albert Museum, accessed 3 February 2012 The New York Times thought the show \\"sufficient-for-the-purpose\\" as a vehicle for the star, but declared Delysia to be \\"stunning\\".\\"Delysia Resplendent\\", The New York Times, 9 November 1920 After a holiday in France, Delysia returned to North America in August 1921 for a 30-week tour of Afgar.

The show had a mixed reception,\\"Mr Cochran's New Revue\\", The Times, 10 March 1922, p. 10 and it suffered a fatal blow when Delysia lost her voice with a throat infection and had to withdraw from the cast six weeks into the run. She was ordered by a throat specialist to rest her voice for three months.\\"Dramatis Personae\\", 21 May 1922, p. 11 Without its star, the show failed to attract the public, and Cochran closed it after less than two months, suffering a loss of ¬£20,000. No√´l Coward, mid-1920s In 1923 and 1924, Delysia made further Broadway appearances, in The Courtesan, a musical comedy, and in the Shubert revue, Topics of 1924. In 1925 she returned to the Cochran stable, starring in his revue On With the Dance, much of which was written and composed by No√´l Coward. During rehearsals for the show, Cochran disliked Coward's song \\"Poor Little Rich Girl\\", written for Delysia, and he wanted to cut it. He backed down in the face of implacable resistance from the author and the performer, and it became Coward's first hit song.Coward, p. 193 Delysia became proprietorial about the number, and was outraged when Coward contemplated giving it to Gertrude Lawrence to sing in New York. Harding writes, \\"'Noel', she screamed with excellent command of idiom if not of accent, 'is a sheet and a boogairr.'\\"Quoted in Hoare, p. 143 Coward later wrote of Delysia, \\"Everything she did she did well, with a satisfying authority and assurance. She was occasionally temperamental and flew into a few continental rages but to me she was always easy to work with and extremely agreeable.\\"Coward, p. 192 Cochran, too, found Delysia a congenial colleague; in his several volumes of autobiography he makes many references to her loyalty and good nature. In 1923 and 1924, Delysia made further Broadway appearances, in The Courtesan, a musical comedy, and in the Shubert revue, Topics of 1924. In London, Delysia starred with George Grossmith, Jr and W. H. Berry in Princess Charming (1926), a Ruritanian musical comedy.\\"Princess Charming\\", The Times, 22 October 1926, p. 16 In November 1928 she married Georges Emile Denis, the general manager of a newspaper. In 1929 she made her first appearance in a non-musical play, Her Past, a comedy by Frederick Jackson, co-starring Violet Vanbrugh. The Times said of her performance: =1930s= Delysia began the 1930s by appearing in variety. She topped the bill at the London Palladium in 1930, but the songs she chose to perform were regarded as either dated or dull.\\"Variety Theatres\\", The Times, 30 April 1930, p. 14 During the same year, she appeared in two successive failures in the West End.

It was adapted for the English stage as a vehicle for Delysia by A. P. Herbert from Oscar Straus and Alfred Gr√ºnwald's 1932 operetta, Eine Frau, die wei√ü, was sie will. Delysia played Josephine Pavani, an ageing actress who loses her lover to her daughter, Pearl, and who later manoeuvres to save Pearl from an unwelcome suitor.\\"Gaiety Theatre\\", The Times, 28 January 1933, p. 8 Delysia's song \\"Every woman thinks she wants to wander'\\" was a big hit. The Times commented, \\"How refreshing in a musical piece to want to hear the author's words! How delightful, when Mme. Delysia is singing, to hear them!\\" On screen, Delysia starred as Madame Valmond in the musical Evensong in 1934.\\"Evensong\\", British Film Institute, accessed 13 February 2012 A year later, she appeared with George Robey, in a farce, Accidentally Yours, by Clifford Grey, adapted from Monsieur √† Cinq Heures, by Maurice Hennequin and Pierre Veber.\\"Climbing at Clifton and Cheddar\\", Western Morning News, 4 July 1935, p. 8 The following year she appeared in her last musical comedy, The Silver Swan by Grey and Guy Bolton, with music by Edward Samuels.\\"Palace Theatre\\", The Times, 20 February 1936, p. 12 In 1938 she and her husband divorced.

In January 1944 she married Commander Ren√© Kolb-Bernard of the Free French Navy. After the war she retired from the stage, and accompanied her husband to a succession of diplomatic postings to which he was sent by the French government. His last post was French consul in the Canary Islands, where Delysia spent much of her retirement. After his death, she moved back to England. Among the honours presented to Delysia were the King's Medal for Freedom; the Africa Star, 8th Army; Medal of French Gratitude; Free French Medal; and the Order of Merit of Lebanon and Syria. Delysia died of cancer at the age of 89 in the French Convalescent Home, Brighton.

Background  Military relations between the United States and Brazil date back to World War II, when Brazil supported the Allied effort in the invasion of Italy in 1942. Brazil provided troops for the invasion. On January 3, 1952, The Brazilian government issued decree 30363 establishing new government regulations. These new regulations allowed for the return of foreign capital that was invested in Brazil and profit remittances on that capital. Shortly after, representatives from the United States and representatives from Brazil started to negotiate a bilateral military assistance agreement in Rio de Janeiro on January 3, 1952. The document outlining the agreement between the two countries would be signed on March 15, 1952. The agreement went into effect on May 19, 1952. During the time of the negotiations, Major General Charles L. Mullins, Jr. negotiated a separate military plan with the Brazilian Government. The plan was approved on March 14, 1952 by the Secretary of Defense Lovett. In a private ceremony on March 15, 1952 United States Major General Mullins and Brazilian General Monteiro signed the military plan that outlined a common defense between the two nations. The agreement allowed major weapons and training by the United States military to the Brazilian military. This tenuous alliance governed the two nations bilateral ties during the events of the Cold War. However, the alliance was short lived, and suffered several major blows between the two nations during the military coup in Brazil in 1964. During this time the United States still provided military support and training to the side that supported the United States.  Military Coup  The United States were willing to go to any means necessary to support the military coup, to prevent Brazil from becoming a communist nation. President Johnson said \\"I think we ought to take every step that we can, be prepared to do everything that we need to do.\\" to keep Brazil from becoming a communist country. President Goulart, Brazil‚Äôs president, supported labor unions, wanted to limit the international business profits from Brazil, and also wanted to begin trading with communist countries. The military coup would eventually win, leading to a twenty-year military dictatorship.

The species is known from Middle to Late Jurassic sediments exposed in the province of Santa Cruz, Argentina. It is one of several extinct species placed in the living genus Equisetum. History and classification Equisetum thermale is represented by a series of fossil specimens preserved in hot springs deposits preserved in the Callovian to Tithonian aged La Matilde Formation. The group is part of the Bah√≠a Laura Group exposed in the northwestern region of the Deseado Massif. The formations is the result of Jurassic age fault generated valleys filled by lacustrian infilling and hydrothermal activity represented by epithermal deposits. One such hot spring deposit, the San Agust√≠n hot spring complex was reported in 2010 and is noted for the preservation of plants growing around the complex by silicification. Along with the other fossils found at the site specimens of Equisetum thermale are highly detailed and complete. The species was described from a part and counterpart pair of specimens, the holotype, number \\"MPM-PB 2029\\" which is currently preserved in the paleobotanical collections housed at the Museo Provincial Padre Jes√∫s Molina, R√≠o Gallegos, Santa Cruz, Argentina. The specimens were studied by a group of four Welsh and Argentinian paleobotanists led by Alan Channing of the School of Earth and Ocean Sciences, Cardiff University, Wales. Channing and his team published their 2011 type description for E. thermale in the American Journal of Botany. The etymology of the chosen specific name thermale is in recognition of both the geology of the type location and as a reference to the original habitat of a hot spring. Description Equisetum thermale shows a combination of morphological characters found in both of the living Equisetum subgenera, E. subgenus Hippochaete and E. subgenus Equisetum. As with members of Equisetum (Equisetum), E. thermale has stoma, occasionally paired, placed on the surface of the stem on both irregular horizontal bands and in vertical files. E. thermale also show infrequent branching of the stems, a feature found only in Equisetum (Hippochaete). This combination is to the modern species Equisetum bogotense which is generally placed as a sister species to the subgenera. Overall the stems of E. thermale grew up to long and in diameter with between six and twelve ridges to the stem.

The ASFiNAG is fully owned by the Austrian government under the responsibility of the Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology or (BMVIT). The A1 at Eugendorf The A3 at the Eisenstadt junction The A2 between Grafenstein and V√∂lkermarkt Ost The A4 heading towards Budapest  Purpose  ASFiNAG was founded on 11 September 1982. In 1997 the company were awarded a new contract whereby more tasks were given to them by the Government. ASFiNAG enforces legislative tolls commissioned by the government. ASFiNAG has the formal Usufruct/right of properties and facilities of the highly ranked street network, which still belongs to the government. ASFiNAG does not receive any money from the state's budget, but pays a dividend to the Republic of Austria.  Fare Structure and Funding  For 2015, ASFiNAG is expecting 1.25 billion euros (¬£885 Million) from tolls, which are paid by lorries and buses depending on the number of axles and distance travelled on motorways based on tachographs. Cars (up to 3.5 t Hz. total weight) and motorbikes contribute a tax called a Vignette, which has to be stuck permanently to the vehicle, to the general high-ranking street network's usage in the amount of 440 million euros (¬£311 million) and also 170 million euros (¬£120 million) of special tolls for more expensive high maintenance roads, from west to east: Arlberg Road Tunnel, the Brennerautobahn (from Innsbruck to Modena, Italy, and only the A13 motorway may be used without a Vignette), Tauern Road Tunnel, Karawanks Tunnel, Bosruck Tunnel and the Gleinalm Tunnel. The collection of these special tolls is completed by single tickets or season tickets which vary in usage (such as a year, month, with route combinations and different discounts for commuters, disabled people and residents), or even tickets for specific roads and multiple journeys. Vehicles which have blue lights, different national and international services, such as Bundesheer (the Austrian Army) and the Justizwache (a section of the Ministry of Justice in Austria) are permanently exempt from the special tolls. (The mountain roads through the Felbertauern Tunnel and over the Grossglockner High Alpine Road are tolled by private parties.) In 2015, ASFiNAG alone will invest from the money it has collected in tolls, 500 million euros (¬£353 million) on the building of new roads, 485 million euros (¬£343 million) for maintaining existing roads, finance the toll collection along with the buying Vignettes from places that sell tobacco and pay back their 11.5 billion euro high (¬£8.2 billion) debt in 20 years time. Traffic experts are recommending that instead of time tolls they should collect a higher mineral oil tax because frequent usage, exhaust fumes and also street wear and tear of heavy vehicles, such as SUVs as opposed to city cars can be presented more appropriately.500 Millionen Euro f√ºr neue Stra√üen.

Biography She was born in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana, the daughter of Martha Macomb and James Dinsmore. At the age of nine, she moved to Boone County, Kentucky, where she resided for the rest of her life. As a child, Julia was tutored at home until she was about sixteen years old, when she was sent to the Seminary for Young Ladies in Cincinnati, taught by Margaret Coxe, author of The Young Lady's Companion. She particularly enjoyed writing poetry and sent poems to be printed in the Times-Democrat of New Orleans. In 1910 Doubleday, Page & Company published a collection of these under the title, Verses and Sonnets.Julia Stockton Dinsmore. Verses and Sonnets'. New York: Doubleday, Page & Co., 1910. While Julia Dinsmore never married, when her older sister, Isabella Dinsmore Flandrau died in 1867, Julia raised her two nieces, Patty and Sally, with financial help from the girls' father, Charles E. Flandrau. Following the death of her father, James Dinsmore, she inherited the Boone farm and continued to manage it until her death in 1926. She faithfully kept a journal for most of this time, giving insight into the life of a woman who lived and wrote during a time of momentous changes for the United States and for women.

It was raised as part of the new army also known as Kitchener's Army and assigned to the 33rd Division. The brigade served on the Western Front. The brigade saw additional action during Britain's involvement in Vietnam following the Second World War. Action in World War I =Battle of the Somme= The Battle of the Somme, July‚ÄìNovember 1916 The 100th Brigade, arrived at Saleux, France on 9 July 1916, arrived at Morlancourt on 11 July, Becordel-Becourt on 12 July, and Flatiron Copse on 14 July. It began an attack on High Wood, a small but highly contested forested area in the Somme, on 15 July during the Allied withdrawal, withdrew itself to Mametz Wood on 16 July, and returned to Becordel-Becourt on 22 July. The brigade camped between Albert and Dernancourt on 23 July, and went to reinforce the 6th Seaforth battalion who were entrenched near High Wood. The 2nd Battalion then advanced with a new trench on 9 August and was replaced by the 16th Battalion of the King's Royal Rifle Corps, which was also part of the 100th Brigade. The 2nd Battalion then traveled to Mametz Wood on 10 August, Becordel-Becourt on 13 August, and Delville Wood on 19 August. On 24 August, the 100th Brigade attacked Tea Trench near High Wood but failed to take the position. The brigade was then relieved, traveled to Ribemont on 30 August, to Molliens-au-Bois on 31 August, to the north of Gommecourt on 19 September, and to Corbie on 19 October. It then relieved the 2nd Worcestershire Regiment at Frosty Trench on 2 November, and successfully took Hazy Trench on 5 November. It then traveled to Carnoy on 6 November, Citadel Camp on 7 November, and Airaines on 10 November. Action in Vietnam During Britain's involvement in protecting French-held Vietnam from the communist Viet Minh, General Douglas Gracey called for reinforcements, namely the 32nd Brigade (United Kingdom) and the 100th Brigade. Upon its arrival at Saigon on 17 October 1945, led by Lt. Colonel C.H.B. Rodham, the brigade was ordered to retake the region in between the towns of Thu Duc, Bien Hoa, and Thu Dau Mot from the Viet Minh. The operation to control that region began on 23 October, with the brigade occupying Thu Duc on the same day, Bien Hoa the next, and Thu Dau Mot on 25 October. This action allowed General Gracey to gather and transport to Japan the Japanese troops remaining in Vietnam from the recently ended Second World War. On 27 December, the 100th Brigade was tasked with maintaining control in Saigon and deporting the remaining Japanese forces. Based on a scouting report received on 31 December, the brigade mounted an attack on Viet Minh positions from 1‚Äì5 January 1946, and defended an assault from the Viet Minh on 3 January. In concordance with the drawdown of British forces so that French colonial forces would control the entirety of Vietnam, the 80th Brigade (operating in Vietnam with the 100th Brigade) was taken off duty on 11 January and departed Vietnam on 22 January. General Gracey departed Vietnam on 28 January, and the 100th Brigade left Saigon for good on 8 February in the SS Cameronia, concluding their action in Vietnam.

It was the first national park in Chiapas when created in 1959, and in 2009 the park was designated a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO. Location The Lagunas de Montebello National Park is in the municipalities of La Trinitaria and La Independencia in southeastern Chiapas state, close to Guatemala. The nearest city is Comit√°n, an hour's drive to the west; the popular tourist city of San Crist√≥bal de las Casas is a further two more hours to the west. Geography The Lagunas de Montebello National Park covers an area of , of which are considered the \\"core area\\". It is located on the high plains of Chiapas, with an altitude between above sea level. Montebello Lakes The main attractions of the national park are its 59 lakes, collectively called the Montebello Lakes. The lakes are famous for their striking colors, which vary due to their different mineral contents, ranging from emerald and turquoise to dark green, and even purple and reddish black. About 15 of the lakes are easily accessible by car or foot. Lago Tziscao is the largest of the lakes with a village nearby. Other lakes include Montebello, La Ca√±ada, Pojoj, and a group of five lakes known as the Lagunas de Colores (Lakes of Colors: Encantada, Ensue√±o, Esmeralda, Agua Tinta, and Bosque Azul). Many of the lakes are open for swimming, canoeing, and kayaking. There are also cenotes and a group of limestone caves called Grutas San Rafael del Arco in the park that can be visited on foot or horseback. Scientists have recently expressed concern that the lakes are losing their colours and becoming muddy and lifeless. This is due to untreated wastewater and agricultural runoff entering the lakes (via the Grande River which flows directly into the lakes) and deforestation of parts of the lake basins.http://geo-mexico.com/?p=14058 Metzabok Lake, which normally covers 220 acres (89 hectares), dried up completely in August 2019 due to drought. Another six lagoons outside the park have also dried up. Maya ruins Also within the park boundary are the medium-sized Maya ruins of Chinkultic, a pre- Columbian city that dates back to the third century and was abandoned in the 13th century. The site is not thoroughly excavated and many of the buildings are still hidden under vegetation. A beautiful view can be seen of many of the national park's multi-colored lakes from the top of the Acropolis, the main pyramid. There are nearly 200 buildings including several pyramids and a unique asymmetrical ball court, whose hieroglyphic inscriptions indicate it was dedicated in May 591. Carved stelae depicting Chinkultic's rulers are scattered among the ruins.

Museo del Prado The Swoon of the Virgin, in Italian Lo Spasimo della Vergine, or Fainting Virgin Mary was an idea developed in the late Middle Ages, that the Virgin Mary had fainted during the Passion of Christ, most often placed while she watched the Crucifixion of Jesus. It was based on mentions in later texts of the apocryphal gospel the Acta Pilati, which describe Mary swooning. It was popular in later medieval art and theological literature, but as it was not mentioned in the Canonical Gospels, it became controversial, and from the 16th century was discouraged by many senior churchmen. The swoon might be placed during the episode of Christ Carrying the Cross, as on the Via Dolorosa in Jerusalem, but very commonly also during the Crucifixion of Jesus; Nicholas Penny estimates that \\"about half of the surviving paintings of the Crucifixion made between 1300 and 1500 will be found to include the Virgin fainting\\".Penny, 26 It also appeared in works showing the Deposition from the Cross and Entombment of Christ,Penny, 28 as well as the 15th-century novelty of Christ taking leave of his Mother. History A fainting Mary is sometimes shown in art as early as the 12th century, and becomes common by the middle of the 13th century. By 1308 the pilgrimage route of the Via Dolorosa in Jerusalem included a church formally dedicated to St John the Baptist but known as the site of the Virgin's swoon; by 1350 guidebooks mention a church of Santa Maria de Spasimo, which was later replaced by housing. The very popular book Meditations on the Life of Christ, of about 1300, mentions three points in the Passion where Mary faints or collapses.Penny, 26; Schiller, II, 152-153 By the 15th century Italian sacri monti included shrines commemorating the spasimo in their routes, and an unofficial feast-day was being celebrated by many, especially the Franciscans, and the Vatican was being asked to make it official.Penny, 26 However no such incident was mentioned in the Four Gospels, and it was disapproved of by many theologians. The backlash produced a work of 1506 by the Dominican Thomas Cajetan, then a professor at the Sapienza University of Rome and later to be head of his order and, as a Cardinal, Martin Luther's opponent in dialogue. Cajetan pointed out the lack of biblical authority and, as described by Nicholas Penny, that \\"the severe physical weakness following a 'spasimo' as defined by Avicenna would be incompatible with the explicit statement in the Gospel of Saint John that the Virgin stood beside the cross, an act of endurance that would have required exceptional strength. Furthermore, even a less serious faint or 'spasimo' would have been incompatible with the Grace that enabled the Virgin to suffer with her full mind\\".Penny, 26 The swoon was probably associated in some cases with the campaign for acceptance of the doctrine of Mary as Co-Redemptrix, which gradually subsided after the Council of Trent. Official disapproval of the swoon gained ground in the Counter-Reformation and was followed by the authors of guides for the clergy on the interpretation of the short and inexplicit decrees of the Council of Trent in 1563 on sacred images, with minutely detailed instructions for artists and commissioners of works. The guides of Molanus (1570), Cardinal Gabriele Paleotti (1582) and Cardinal Federigo Borromeo objected to the depiction, and it was criticised by authors of theological works on the Virgin such as Peter Canisius (1577). At least in Rome there appears to have been actual censorship, with paintings removed from public view and permission refused for the publication of an engraving by Cornelius Bloemaert of a Crucifixion by Annibale Carraci, which had to be published in Paris instead.Penny, 28 However no more official condemnation of the belief in the incident came, and although new depictions were fewer, existing ones remained in place, including many in Dominican churches. Indeed, where the swooning Virgin was depicted, she was often even more prominent. Depictions placed other than at the Crucifixion itself avoided many of the theological objections.Penny, 26-28 The examples illustrated show more complete fainting, but in many images the Virgin remains standing, supported by St John, the Three Marys, or other disciples. Many images are ambiguous, presumably deliberately, and can be read as the Virgin either feeling faint, or simply stricken with grief. One major work to depict the Swoon is The Descent from the Cross by Rogier van der Weyden (Prado, c. 1435), in which the body of the Virgin, with eyes closed, is parallel to that of her son just above.Schiller, II, 168 Churches A number of churches take the name of the Swoon, including: *Santa Maria dello Spasimo, Palermo, Sicily *Santa Maria dello Spasimo, Modugno, Bari *Beata Vergine dello Spasimo, Cerea, Province of Verona *Madonna dello Spasimo, Bergamo Gallery File:The-Cucifixion-157 –ú–∞—Å—Ç–µ—Ä –ß–∏—Ç—Ç–∞ –¥–∏ –ö–∞—Å—Ç–µ–ª–ª–æ. –ú–∞–Ω—á–µ—Å—Ç–µ—Ä..jpgItalian, c. 1320 File:Giotto, Lower Church Assisi, Crucifixion 01.jpgLower Church, Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi, Assisi File:Berswordt-Altar-Mitte-Detail.jpgMarienkirche, detail from the Berswordt-Altar File:Boccaccio Boccaccino - Christ carrying the Cross (National Gallery, London).jpgBoccaccio Boccaccino, Christ Carrying the Cross (National Gallery, London) File:Albrecht Altdorfer, Christ Taking Leave of His Mother (probably 1520).jpgChrist taking Leave of his Mother, Albrecht Altdorfer c. 1520 File:LE BRUN Charles The Descent from the Cross.jpgCharles Le Brun, Descent from the Cross File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 071.jpgRembrandt, Descent from the Cross, 1632-33 with a literally down to earth depiction (bottom left) File:Berg bei RV Pfarrkirche Kreuztragung.jpgIn a Christ Carrying the Cross, from a South German church See also *Madonna (art) *Marian art in the Catholic Church *Piet√† *Nursing Madonna Notes References *Penny, Nicholas, National Gallery Catalogues (new series): The Sixteenth Century Italian Paintings, Volume I, 2004, National Gallery Publications Ltd, *Schiller, Gertrud, Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. II, 1972 (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, Further reading *Neff, Amy, \\"The Pain of Compassio : Mary's Labor at the Foot of the Cross\\", 1998, The Art Bulletin, vol. 80, no. 2, pp. 255‚Äì273 *von Simson, Otto G., \\" Compassio and Co-redemption in Roger van der Weyden's Descent from the Cross\\", 1953, The Art Bulletin, Vol. 35, No. 1, March, 1953, pp. 9‚Äì16. *Rubin, Miri.

Early life Henry Joseph Kelliher (n√© Keliher) was born in Waikerikeri, near Clyde in Central Otago, New Zealand on 2 March 1896; the son of an Irish immigrant Michael Keliher who came to New Zealand during the Goldrush in Central Otago. Information about his early years is not plentiful but moved to the Wairarapa at the age of 17 to work as a Drover in Carterton prior to the outbreak of World War One. World War One When war broke out in Europe in 1914 Kelliher enlisted with the Otago Mounted Rifles as served as a Trooper until he was transferred during service at Gallipoli in 1915. Kelliher survived the Gallipoli campaign and served in France at the Somme in a specialised Trench Warfare mortar team until he was gassed and invalided to Britain in 1917. Family While in Britain recovering from injuries sustained during the War, Kelliher met his to-be wife Evelyn. They were married in Belfast, Northern Ireland on 17 July 1917 in the Roman Catholic faith. She had been previously married but widowed at an early age. The family would go on to have 4 daughters and a son, Henry Kelliher Jr, a Painter who pre-deceased his father. The Kelliher family was survived by several branches including the Rosser and White families of two of his daughters who are currently involved with his charitable Trusts; and the Stephens family, through his son. Kelliher has several dozen grandchildren and great grandchildren around New Zealand, Australia and the rest of the world. Business By the time the war ended in 1918, Kelliher and his new wife had returned to New Zealand and began farming in the Wairarapa. He pulled out of farming to invest in the Marquis of Normanby Hotel in Carterton, one of the few licensed drinking venues in the Wairarapa area due to the dry-state that the town of Masterton had been placed in several years earlier. Through this investment Kelliher began to grow his fortunes and soon began investing in other local drinking establishments and hotels. From 1922 Kelliher chose to base himself in Auckland where he saw the potential for investment opportunities and soon began acquiring agent licenses for key brands of spirit such as Dewar's White Label Whisky in 1926. He also invested in the New Zealand magazine Ladies Mirror in which he promoted the rights of progressive women and extolled the rights of women, particularly those widowed young after the war, to engage in education and trade. He also used this magazine to begin his campaign on monetary reform after he took editorial control of the magazine in 1930. Unlike many businessmen during this era, it was by 1929‚Äì1930 that Kelliher had made an exceptionally comfortable living having not yet reaching 35. He chose however to continue his business ventures, choosing to invest with a South Auckland Brewing family run by Morton Coutts. Through this Brewery Henry Kelliher founded the company of Dominion Breweries which would eventually become a household name in New Zealand. Kelliher used his investment prowess to continue to purchase hotels and other drinking establishments across New Zealand to promote the brands he was creating as well as acquiring other leading international and local beer and spirit brands; these actions leading to the Australian Stock exchange considering Dominion Breweries one of the leading enterprises of New Zealand. Kelliher at this time was considered one of the 10 richest men in New Zealand and was appointed by the Michael Savage led Labour Government to act as the Government representative Director on the Bank of New Zealand, prior to its Nationalisation. He served in this capacity from 1936 to 1942, when despite the war, he felt his principles had to take precedence over what he felt was inappropriate financial action on behalf of the Government. During the war his businesses remained steady and ensured that Dominion Breweries kept paying those staffers who had signed up for active war service, something he could no longer undertake due to age and prior injury. He also oversaw the embarkment of several consignments of lager for the servicemen stationed in the Middle east. After the war, Kelliher's business skyrocketed with a market share of approximately 20% of all liquor and other alcohols in New Zealand being from one of his breweries or licensed hotels; it has been opined that Kelliher's actions effectively created the current situation in New Zealand where most drinking establishments are aligned to one major brewery or another despite Dominion Breweries no longer owning the vast majority of the former hotels. By the 1960s DB Breweries was a leading brand and Kelliher although still very active as Managing director of the Company had his eyes on new ventures. Philanthropy Kelliher has begun his engagement in Philanthropy through the magazine, Ladies Mirror in the early 1930s but it was in 1956 when he created the Kelliher Art Prize, that this became a leading component of his investment. The prizes consisted of an award of 500 Pounds to those artists that produced what he felt was a great example of New Zealand landscape scenery, from the early 1960s he included a separate non-abstract watercolor painting component of the prize. In 1989 Kelliher stated: I believe it was those early memories of the Central Otago landscape that made me decide, years later, to finance the Kelliher Art Awards, so that our artists here might be encouraged to record the beauty of the country for posterity Rosser. 131 This prizes today is considered in mixed light due in part to the considerations by some art critics, such as Hamish Keith, as being detrimental to the growth of New Zealand art due to the strict parameters of the prizes. The Art collection is now administered by the Kelliher Art Trust. The Prize was discontinued as an annual award in 1977 due to the growth of New Zealand art but the Charitable Trust still engages in purchases and the promotion of Exhibitions through his descendants. Henry Kelliher also established the Kelliher Economic Prize for schools which was initially established in 1963 and is still annually awarded. In the 1963 New Year Honours, Kelliher was appointed a Knight Bachelor, for public and philanthropic services. In 1956, he was created a Commander of the Order of St John. Later life Kelliher stepped down from active involvement in Dominion Breweries in 1982, taking on the Honorary title of Founding President. From this time on he mostly remained at Puketutu Island which he had owned since the 1950s. Puketutu Island, in the Manukau Harbour, is a large island, now connected to the mainland off the coast of the Auckland airport. Here Kelliher had spent several decades raising champion Bulls, Stud Horses and Racing stock such as the former Champion Racehorses Cardigan Bay and Easton Light among others of which he used many for stud upon their retirement. He practised yoga well into old age. Death Following his son's early death in 1984 and his wife Evelyn's death in 1986 he withdrew to Puketutu island. He stayed semi-active in the community until his death in September 1991 at the age of 95. He was survived by his daughters, grandchildren and numerous great-grandchildren. He was buried in Hillsborough Cemetery in Auckland overlooking Manukau Harbour and Puketutu Island.  References  Y.

Keller was a member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. She was born in Carthage, Missouri, United States. Biography She studied medicine at the American Medical Missionary College in Battle Creek, Michigan, where she met MƒÅui P≈çmare and her future husband Peter Martin Keller. Peter Keller went to Australia to work on behalf of the Seventh Day Adventist Church. Florence graduated in 1900 and later joined Peter, becoming the first Seventh Day Adventist female doctor to be sent overseas. The couple married in Christchurch, New Zealand on 13 August 1901. When Seventh Day Adventist medical institutions in Australia became overstaffed, the General Conference asked the Kellers to make room for the older doctors by entering private practice. The Kellers worked as locums in various parts of Australia, then moved to Huntly, New Zealand, in 1903. Later they set up in private practice in Auckland. While in New Zealand Florence Keller became an outspoken campaigner for many health-related issues including the temperance movement, the rational dress movement, improvements to prevention and treatment of tuberculosis and support of sunbathing as a healthy activity. She was invited to join the faculty at the University of Auckland and taught hygiene and health principles. Keller was also appointed to the Board of Governors of Auckland General Hospital, a position she held from 1913‚Äì1921. In 1913 she was elected as a member of the Auckland Hospital Board as an independent candidate. She was re-elected for three further terms on the Labour Party ticket where she \\"topped the poll\\", receiving more votes than any other candidate. The Kellers returned to the United States permanently in late 1919 after about twenty years in New Zealand and worked at the College of Medical Evangelists in Los Angeles. Dr. Peter and Dr. Florence began the Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology, respectively. In 1923, Dr. Peter Keller took over a post at the Glendale Sanitarium which he held until 1931, when he was fatally shot by an insane patient. Dr. Florence Keller remained at the College of Medical Evangelists and became emeritus professor of gynecology there in 1941. She died just before her 99th birthday, in 1974. Keller was survived by her daughter Frances, also a doctor. Surgery A fellow of the International and American College of Surgeons, Keller was known mainly as a surgeon in the later part of her life. One notable operation quite early in her career, in 1919, was an appendectomy performed on board a ship at sea in the Pacific. The engineer's mess room was used as an operating theatre and surgical instruments were sterilised in the ship's galley. Keller was still doing surgery and seeing patients six days a week until she was 92. Veganism Keller was an early vegan who argued against vegetarians consuming dairy and egg products.Amey, Catherine. (2014).

He was ordained to the diaconate on December 7, 1942, and to the priesthood on June 29, 1943. He founded Trinity Institute at Trinity Church, Wall Street. He earned his B.A. degree in philosophy from Syracuse and the Bachelor of Divinity degree from the Episcopal Theological School in Cambridge, MA. Terwilliger was awarded the PhD by Yale University in 1948, writing on the ecclesiology of F.D. Maurice. At Yale he came under the influence of the moral theologian H. Richard Niebuhr. The son of a Methodist minister in Upstate New York, Terwilliger believed in the value of good preaching and was himself an impressive preacher. He seldom used notes but his sermons came off his tongue as finely wrought, literary utterances. He could lecture or preach without notes for forty-five minutes to an hour. Terwilliger served as Rector of Christ Church, Poughkeepsie NY, for eleven years. During these years he was also a very effective Chaplain to Episcopal students at Vassar College. In 1960, he was called to St. James Church, Los Angeles, where his progressive view of race relations created serious tension with members of his congregation. He soon resigned St. James and moved back to New York, where, until he was elected Bishop Suffragan of Dallas in 1974 (consecrated in 1975), he served as a parish priest and a much- respected theologian and Christian intellectual. The Trinity Institute was founded in 1967 with a grant from Trinity Church, Wall Street. It was a great success. Terwilliger's objective was to get Episcopalians together in a great city in order to form friendships while gaining exposure to the best religious voices in the world. The idea for the Institute was hatched at a French restaurant on the Lower East Side, when A.M. Allchin (1930-2010) of the Pusey House, Oxford, and Terwilliger were having dinner. Both were keenly interested in the theology and religion of the Eastern Orthodox Churches and believed that Anglicanism and Orthodoxy have much in common. Michael Ramsey (1904-1988), Archbishop of Canterbury from 1961 to 1974, had appointed both Allchin and Terwilliger to the Anglican-Orthodox Dialogue. In terms of society and politics, Terwilliger was very progressive in many of his views. He believed that women should have equal rights in the work-place and in society generally. However, he attracted the wrath of some Episcopalians for his continuing opposition to the ordination of women to the priesthood. His reasons for opposition were strictly theological and deeply conditioned by his commitment to the reunion of Christians, especially Anglicans and Eastern Orthodox. He therefore emerged in the 1970s as one of the most articulate defenders of traditional practice and he vigorously opposed the ordination of women in the Episcopal Church. A beloved shepherd of the flock, Terwilliger was a strong bishop, a generous pastor to all sorts and conditions of persons, and he lived an unpretentious, simple life. Some of Bishop Terwilliger's more important publications are: Receiving the Word of God. New York: Morehouse- Barlow, 1960. Towards a Living Liturgy: The Liturgy of the Lord's Supper Examined in Essays. New York: Church of Saint Mary the Virgin, 1969. Christian Believing. New York: Morehouse-Barlow, 1973.

There has been controversy about the impact of the company on the environment and the local communities, Assets and operations Sodefor was founded in 1994 and acquired assets in Bandundu formerly owned by Forescom, a nationalized company that was suspended in 1990. These included a sawmill and plywood factory in Nioki and a forestry concession area of more than . Due to the First Congo War (1996-7) and Second Congo War (1998-2003), operations were initially very limited, with the Nioki plant closed completely in 1998/1999. Since 2004 the company has been undertaking a major expansion program. The main concession areas are to the north and south of Lake Mai-Ndombe and on both sides of the Lukenie River, centered on Oshwe. In October 2008 the Environment Minister, Jos√© Endundu, said the DRC would probably cancel about 2/3 of its logging contracts under an anti-corruption program sponsored by the World Bank. Concession areas would shrink from 22 million hectares to 7 million hectares. This would affect Sodecom and two other foreign-owned companies. Controversy Sodefor has been certified by the Forest Stewardship Council, which promote responsible management of the world‚Äôs forests. Indeed, Sodefor had a Chain of Custody certificate for Controlled Wood (for its traceability system). In April 2011, the certificate allocated to Sodefor has been suspended, and in May 2011, Greenpeace International filed a formal complaint with FSC regarding FSC's association with Sodefor. In February 2010 twenty- seven people of the Bokongo community in Oshwe Territory led by Deputy Bosama Henri were arrested and charged for attacking the company and paralyzing its activities. They claimed that the company had moved the boundaries and had never paid the customary dues to the local people. In September 2010 hundreds of people in Oshwe, a community in the Mai-Ndombe District of Bandundu Province, demonstrated against SODEFOR. They were demanding a halt to industrial logging in the region, which degrades the rainforest on which the community depends without bringing benefits to the impoverished community. In February 2011 the people of Batito-sud in Oshwe territory addressed a memo to the Minister of the Environment asking for an investigation into the company's finances. They claimed Sodefor had done nothing to develop the community. Roads had not been maintained and no longer existed.

Feeding  At the anterior end of the protozoan, this organism manifests a rostrum which contains a microtubular structure (the pseudoconoid) The pseudoconoid forms an open cone and which is located adjacent to microtubular bands, micronemes and rhoptries. The pseudoconoid begins near the kinetosomes of the flagella and passes along the flagellate pocket into the rostrum. While feeding on prey organisms the rostrum is inserted into the body of the prey and the cytoplasm is sucked out. Known prey organisms include bodonids, chrysomonads, percolomonads.

She received an M.A. from Williams College in 1984 and a Master of Philosophy degree in Art History from City University Graduate Center in 1997; and Career Spector was appointed as a Guggenheim curator in 1989. At the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, she has organized exhibitions and retrospectives on or of conceptual photography, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Matthew Barney's Cremaster Cycle, Richard Prince, Louise Bourgeois, Marina Abramovic, Maurizio Cattelan and Tino Sehgal. She also organized the group exhibitions Moving Pictures (2003), Singular Forms (Sometimes Repeated) (2004), and theanyspacewhatever (2008). Under the Deutsche Guggenheim in Berlin, Spector initiated special commissions by Andreas Slominski, Hiroshi Sugimoto, and Lawrence Weiner. Spector was adjunct curator of the 1997 Venice Biennale and a co-curator of the first Berlin Biennale in 1998. In 2007 she was the U.S. Commissioner for the Venice Biennale, where she presented an exhibition of work by Felix Gonzalez-Torres.

In 2014, she was named one of the top 25 most important women in the art world by Artnet. Additionally, Forbes named Spector on the \\"40 Women To Watch Over 40\\" list.  Controversy  On 5th November 2019, Spector hosted a panel for an exhibition in the Guggenheim called \\"Basquiat‚Äôs ‚ÄòDefacement‚Äô: The Untold Story\\". This panel excluded Cha√©dria LaBouvier, the curator of the exhibition. LaBouvier had previously complained that the museum had made decisions for her exhibition without her consultation. She was also excluded from the deinstallation process, which is standard for curators to oversee. When LaBouvier raised this issue during the panel, Elizabeth Duggal, President of the Guggenheim Museum, said: \\"...I know you want to do this in a public forum, happy to talk separately...\\" and defended the decision by saying that the panel had acknowledged her efforts. A 2020 independent investigation by an outside law firm, initiated by the museum, found no evidence of discrimination towards LaBouvier. Spector stepped down from her position at the Guggenheim in October 2020. Select bibliography * Spector, Nancy, and F√©lix Gonz√°lez- Torres. Felix Gonzalez-Torres.

Roberts and Geoffrey Samuel which was published by Edinburgh University Press in 1998. Containing fourteen separate papers produced by various scholars working in the field of Pagan studies, the book examines different forms of contemporary Paganism as practiced in Europe and North America. Divided into three parts, the first, entitled \\"A Chthonic Imperative? Religion and Nature in the Modern World\\" contained papers from scholars such as Peter Beyer, Steven Sutcliffe and Wouter J. Hanegraaff and dealt with the relationship between contemporary Paganism and various features of contemporary society, such as globalisation and the secularisation of the natural world. The second part, entitled \\"The Pagan Alternative: the Goddess and Nature\\", contained papers by Prudence Jones, Ronald Hutton, Susan Greenwood, Elizabeth Puttick and Geoffrey Samuel dealing with the role of goddess figures in the Pagan movement. Finally, the third part of the book, entitled \\"Nature Religion in Practice\\", contained articles by Jone Salomonsen, Philip Shallcrass, Vivianne Crowley and Alastair McIntosh dealing with the various religious practices of Pagans. Origins The first international academic conference on the subject of Pagan studies had been held at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, North-East England in 1993, having been organised by the religious studies scholars Graham Harvey and Charlotte Hardman.Clifton 2004. p. 8. In April 1996 a larger conference dealing with contemporary Paganism then took place at Ambleside in the Lake District; organised by the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Lancaster, North-West England, it was entitled \\"Nature Religion Today: Western Paganism, Shamanism and Esotericism in the 1990s\\".Pearson, Roberts and Samuel 1998. p. 1. The conference's organisers later described its original intentions, remarking that through it they \\"sought to explore the innovations in practice and belief which constitute contemporary Paganism, and which appear to be a part of a widespread cultural response to the decay of main-line religions and to a widely felt awareness of ecological crisis.\\" Synopsis =Part One: A Cthonic Imperative? Religion and Nature in the Modern World= Beyer's \\"Globalisation and the Religion of Nature\\" The anthology's opening paper was written by Peter Beyer, then an Associate Professor of Religious Studies at the University of Ottawa, Canada, and the author of the book Religion and Globalization (1994). In this paper, Beyer delved the definition of \\"nature religion\\" developed by the American religious studies scholar Catherine Albanese, looking at those religious movements whose \\"devotees consider nature to be the embodiment of divinity, sacredness, transcendence, spiritual power, or whatever cognate term one wishes to use\\".Beyer 1998. p. 11. Proceeding to provide a basic summary of globalisation, he then made a brief discussion of how the two interact, arguing that nature religions had a tendency to develop a counter-structural strategy in dealing with globalising forces. In this manner they emphasise the idea that spiritual authenticity is stronger among the oppressed, such as those indigenous communities who adhere to nature religionist beliefs.Beyer 1998. pp. 16-21. Hanegraaff's \\"Reflections on New Age and the Secularisation of Nature\\" Beyer's paper was followed by that provided by Wouter J.

He is a Democratic member of the Philadelphia City Council since 2012. Political career Henon, an electrician by trade, has worked as a steward, sub-foreman and foreman. The head of the local chapter of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), Johnny Dougherty, eventually named him the chapter's new Political Director, a position from which Henon lobbied various levels of government on legislative issues pertaining to the electrical industry. Henon also managed election day operations for endorsed candidates, educated campaign volunteers, and coordinated major campaign events. He also served as Chairman of the local‚Äôs Political Action Committee, as board member of the Electrical Mechanical Association, and as a delegate to the IBEW International Convention. In 2011, he was elected to Philadelphia City Council's Sixth District, succeeding the retiring incumbent Democrat Joan Krajewski. Since taking office, Henon has focused on quality of life issues in the 6th District through his Bad Neighbor Initiative, which aims to identify the residents and owners of properties who have received multiple property maintenance code violation notices for ongoing issues like trash; over-grown weeds; high grass; and broken windows, which cause property values to drop, neighborhoods to decline and community morale to fade. The 'worst of the worst' owners are issued subpoenas to testify in front of City Council. Henon also developed and released the City Hall app, a Philadelphia first-of-its-kind way for residents to interact with City government to report issues from problem properties to potholes. Manufacturing was also a key focus during Henon's first term. At his urging, Mayor Michael Nutter named a Manufacturing Task Force, of which Henon was named co-chair. The task force was charged with studying the current manufacturing sector and making comprehensive recommendations on how it can grow in the Philadelphia region. The pursuit grew from his strong family ties to manufacturing and belief in bringing family-sustaining jobs back to Philadelphia's neighborhoods. Family health and physical activity was another key focus for Henon in 2013, when he launched his Philly Play! initiative, which aimed at promoting play and physical activity as a preventative health measure to families. Central to that effort is the promotion of public play spaces such as recreation centers, basketball courts and other outdoor and indoor play areas, such as Police Athletic League centers. Criminal charges In January 2019, Henon was indicted along with other members of the IBEW Local 98, including its business manager Johnny Dougherty, for embezzlement and theft in a corruption probe by federal officials. Henon stated that he will contest the charges and not resign from office. Personal life Henon and his wife, Jill, live in Northeast Philadelphia with their two sons.

The town of V√©lez, Santander Department, is a major centre of production for the sweet and gives it the alternative name \\"bocadillo Vele√±o\\". In Venezuela, the form of consumption is similar to that of Colombia, where the product is called \\"conserva\\". In Venezuela, it can be of guava, coco, banana etc. Bocadillo is commonly accompanied by cheese, spread upon bread, or simply eaten on its own. It most often takes the form of a small rectangular block, with a firm consistency and a deep red colour, giving it a similar appearance to the related Spanish dessert dulce de membrillo. Very similar to guava jelly dessert is the closely related Brazilian goiabada, also made from guava but with less sugar. In 2006, the bocadillo vele√±o was nominated for the cultural symbol for Colombia in the contest organized by a magazine, Semana. Preparation Bocadillo is prepared much like other conserves, jams, and jellies. The guavas are first washed and peeled before being mashed into a pulp, which is strained to remove seeds. The pulp is then boiled in water along with panela or refined sugar at a low temperature for several hours until the mixture has a thick consistency. The liquid is left to cool off to make it be molded into blocks. It gets its characteristic firm texture once it is fully cooled. Bocadillo de guayaba is traditionally individually wrapped in the leaves of the bijao (calathea lutea) to preserve it and to enhance its flavour.

The song is based on Dr. John's \\"The Lonesome Guitar Strangler\\", released on his 1969 album Babylon. It was written and played by Mick Jagger to be the Stones' final single for Decca Records. The Stones were leaving Decca and starting their own record label, but Decca claimed they were owed one more single under the band's current contract. The Stones thence delivered this song, with its context and language chosen specifically to anger Decca executives (there are explicit references to fellatio, anal sex and bestiality in the lyrics). Decca refused to issue the song as part of an album. Decca retaliated by releasing a compilation album called Stone Age, a collection of Stones songs previously released under Decca; this angered the Stones, who felt that the Decca release would cut into sales of their own forthcoming album to be released under their new label. The Stones publicly denounced Stone Age, which went on to be a top-ten hit in Britain nevertheless. The track has never been released officially in any form. All available formats, like a 1983 German flexi-disc, are unofficial releases.

Biography He was born at the Moitzelfitz estate in Pomerania. He was brought up by his uncle Heinrich von Arnim, who was Prussian ambassador at Paris and foreign minister in March 1848, while Cojnt Arnim-Boytzenburg, whose daughter Harry von Arnim afterwards married, was Minister President. Harry von Arnim studied law and entered the diplomatic service. After serving in some other posts, he was appointed ambassador to the Pope in 1864, and during the First Vatican Council (1869-1870), as ambassador of the North German Confederation, supported the German bishops who opposed the dogma if papal infallibility. He was made a count in 1870 and, during the next year, took a prominent part in the negotiations preceding the Treaty of Frankfort. His success in the treaty negotiations was enough that he received an appointment as ambassador to France in 1872, a post of great difficult and responsibility. Differences soon arose between him and Chancellor Otto von Bismarck: Arnim wished to support the monarchical party that was trying to overthrow Adolphe Thiers, but Bismarck ordered him to stand aloof from all French parties. Arnim did not give that implicit obedience to his instructions that Bismarck required. Bismarck, however, was unable to recall him because of the great influence that Arnim enjoyed at court and the confidence that the Kaiser placed in him. He was looked upon by the Conservative Party, which were trying to overthrow Bismarck, as his successor, and it is said that he was closely connected with the court intrigues against the Chancellor. In 1874 Bismarck secured Armin's transfer to Constantinople, but that appointment was immediately revoked. A Vienna newspaper published some correspondence on the Vatican Council, including confidential despatches of Arnim, with the object of showing that he had shown greater foresight than Bismarck. It was then found that a considerable number of papers were missing from the Paris embassy, and on 4 October, Arnim was arrested on the charge of embezzling state papers. That recourse to the criminal law against a man of his rank, who had held one of the most important diplomatic posts, caused great astonishment. His defense was that the papers were not official, and he was acquitted on the charge of embezzlement but convicted of undue delay in restoring official papers and condemned to three months' imprisonment. On appeal, the sentence was increased to nine months. Arnim escaped punishment by remaining outside of the German Empire, chiefly in Austria. In 1875, he published anonymously in Zurich the pamphlet \\"Pro nihilo\\" in which he attempted to show that the attack on him had been caused by Bismarck's personal jealousy. For that, he was accused of treason, insult to the emperor and libelling Bismarck and, in his absence, condemned to five years' penal servitude. From his exile in Austria, he published two more pamphlets on the ecclesiastical policy of Prussia, \\"Der Nunzius kommt!\\" (Vienna, 1878) and \\"Quid faciamus nos?\\" (Vienna, 1879). He made repeated attempts, which were supported by his family, to be allowed to return to Germany to take his trial afresh on the charge of treason. His request had just been granted when he died in Nice, France. Legacy In 1876, Bismarck carried an amendment to the criminal code to make it an offence punishable with imprisonment or a fine up to the equivalent of ¬£250 for an official of the Foreign Office to communicate to others official documents or for an envoy to act contrary to his instructions. The clauses were commonly spoken of in Germany as the \\"Arnim paragraphs\\".

This genus is widespread and has been found infecting copepods from both marine and freshwater ecosystems.  classis = parasitism has been seen to interfere with fertility in both sexes of copepods.  Taxonomy and History  The Ellobiopsis type species, Ellobiopsis chattoni, was first described in 1910 by Caullery after being isolated from an infected copepod found in the Mediterranean Sea. Ellobiopsis was first classified as a dinoflagellate, but observation of a spore forming organelle concluded that the Ellobiopsis was not a part of this group. Phylogeny based on small subunit (SSU) ribosomal DNA places Ellobiopsis in the Alveolata. In the family Ellobiopsidae, the most closely related genus is Thalassomyces. Three species have been defined in this genus: Ellobiopsis chattoni Caullery (1910), Ellobiopsis elongata Steuer (1932) and Ellobiopsis fagei Hovasse (1951). These species are characterized by morphology of their reproductive structures and their ability to infect species specific hosts.  Description  = Morphology = During dispersal, unflagellated spores of Ellobiopsis land on the surface of potential hosts. Once in contact with a host, the cell body of the organism grows and takes on an oval shape. A rhizoid pierces the host cuticle to root the parasite in the copepod tissue. The cell body constricts in the center and differentiate into trophomere and gonomere, proximal and distal to the host body. The cell forms a conical shape. The number of gonomeres is distinguishes species. The cell body has been seen to grows to a length of 700 ¬µm and a width of 350 ¬µm. = Life cycle = The parasitic life cycle of Ellobiopsis chattoni begins with a spore that lands on the surface of a host appendage. A stalk attaches the parasite to the host and it uses an organelle for penetration, called a rhizoid, of the cuticle and to root itself in the host tissue. As the cell grows the root is used for absorption, causing damaging to the local host tissue. Once established at a specific size, approximately 400 ¬µm, the cell body begins to partition itself in half. The half not attached to the host becomes the gonomere and the half attached to the host is named the trophomere. As the gonomere and trophomere partitioning continues to partition, the spore begins to form in the gonomere and it takes on a granulated texture. The pre-spores are released from the reproductive body and form spores for dispersal to the next host.

Working with architect Doug Thompson, a new post and beam structure was created on the footprint of the old barn. In the mid- nineties a new tracking room was constructed which doubled the size of the studio. The studio was also used for commercials from time to time, but the Hadlocks kept those two sides of their business separated, as it was considered in the music industry \\"not hip\\" to do commercials.

In 1945, American mycologist Rolf Singer described a species he found in Florida during his 1942‚Äì3 tenure of a Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship. He originally described it as a subspecies of the eastern North American species Boletus frostii, but later considered it worthy of distinct species status in a 1947 publication. Although known as a species of Boletus for over 50 years, the current interpretation, based on molecular phylogenetic analysis, is that the taxon belongs in Exsudoporus. Exsudoporus floridanus differs from Exsudoporus frostii in having a lighter cap colorSpecifically, \\"Corinthian red\\" in the subspecies compared with \\"jasper red\\", \\"nopal red\\" or \\"carmine\\" in the typical form, using Ridgway color standards. and in the texture of the cap surface: the subspecies is tomentose (covered with dense, short, soft, matted hairs) or velutinous (like velvet), compared to the relatively smooth surface of E. frostii. Singer notes that although the physical characteristics between the two taxa may be blurred and are hard to define, the area of origin is a reliable indicator of subspecies status. E. floridanus is found on shaded lawns and scrubland in open oak stands in non-tropical regions of Florida, typically on grassy or sandy soil. It grows under or near several oak species, including chapman oak (Quercus chapmanii), swamp laurel oak (Q. laurifolia), and southern live oak (Q. virginiana), and it fruits between May and October.

The work is regarded as one of the better examples of Lichtenstein's sense of humor. The work is held in the collection at the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth. Background In 1961, Lichtenstein had developed the technique of emulating the mechanized production techniques, while simultaneously depicting the subjects of pop culture. This extended his pop art to a second dimension. He did so by developing a technique that took Ben-Day dots from small comic book panels and magazine pages to the grand scale of his oversized paintings. Lichtenstein was a trained United States Army pilot, draftsman and artist as well as a World War II (WWII) veteran who never saw active combat. His list of aeronautical themed works is extensive. Mr. Bellamy depicts an air force soldier, according to some sources. However, other sources claim that the subject is a military officer of unknown branch of service. Created in Lichtenstein's breakthrough year, Mr. Bellamy represents an art world inside joke, which was succeeded the following year by a satirical statement on his own career the following year with Masterpiece.Shanes, p. 38 In the work, Lichtenstein presents a wholesome male protagonist heading to an important meeting with a \\"Mr. Bellamy\\", who shared a name with one of Lichtenstein's important art world contacts, Richard \\"Dick\\" Bellamy, Green Gallery art dealer and director, who was known for presenting new work by unknown artists who had never been shown before.Shanes, p. 87 The text balloon says \\"I am supposed to report to a Mr. Bellamy. I wonder what he's like.\\" In November 1961, Lichtenstein sent Mr. Bellamy to Leo Castelli for sale. Critical response The work represents Lichtenstein's \\"gentle, professorial humor\\" and his penchant for \\"corny themes, colors, and postures.\\" Apart from enlarging its size, Lichtenstein presented a \\"mere copy, lacking artistic originality and creativity\\" in this work. This subject matter sourced from comic books was regarded as \\"the lowest commercial and intellectual kind\\" because of public sentiment on the heels of 1950s United States Senate investigations of connections between comics and juvenile delinquency.

Life  Christian Louis I was born as Christian I, the son of the Duke Adolf Frederick I and his wife, Anna Maria (1601‚Äì1634), the daughter of Count Enno III of East Frisia. On 26 August 1625, when he was only one year old, his father proposed that he be the next administrator of the Bishopric of Schwerin. However, he was never appointed, because when Administrator Ulrik III died on 12 August 1633, the Bishopric fell to Wallenstein as a completed fief. He inherited Mecklenburg-Schwerin when his father died on 27 February 1658. In 1660, he built a Lustschloss near the Ratzeburg Minster. He travelled to Paris in 1662, to the court of Louis XIV. On 29 September 1663, he converted to the Catholic faith. The next day, his godfather Louis XIV gave him the second name Louis. Later, however, he often signed only with Christian. He died on in The Hague. His body was transported by ship to D√∂mitz. It was then transported to Schwerin and finally arrived on 24 August 1692 in Doberan, where he was buried in the Doberan Minster.  Marriages  He married twice. His first wife was Christine Margaret (31 March 1615 - 16 August 1666), the second daughter of Duke John Albert II of Mecklenburg- G√ºstrow. She was the widow of Duke Francis Albert of Saxe-Lauenburg, whom she had married on . Francis Albert had died on 10 June 1642 from wounds he had received in the battle of ≈öwidnica. She married Christian on 6 July 1650 in Hamburg. However, on 16 October 1660, a divorce was pronounced by an ecclesiastical court composed specifically for this case by Christian. She never recognized the divorce. It was, however, declared valid by a committee of ten professors of canon law of the University of Paris the Sorbonne. The divorce was confirmed by the Pope on 3 October 1663. His second wife was Elisabeth Angelique de Montmorency, Duchesse de Coligny, (b. 1626). She was the widow Gaspard IV de Coligny, the son of Gaspard III de Coligny. Her first husband had died at Charenton-le-Pont on 9 February 1649 during the Fronde. The exact date of Elisabeth Angelique's wedding to Christian Louis is not known with certainty, but it was probably on 3 March 1664. She died on in Paris. Both marriages were childless. When Christian Louis I died, he was succeeded by his nephew Frederick William, the eldest son of Duke Frederick of Mecklenburg-Grabow.

The organization claims its members collectively employ more than 150,000 people and generate billions in economic activity each year.Alberta Enterprise Group, About us, Accessed: Feb. 3, 2012 The organization states its mission as applying the collective experience of its members in order to solve public policy challenges and to form and promote public policy solutions and to provide forums for the exchange of ideas and best practices. History In 2006 a group of Alberta business leaders came together to form a fundraising/political action group called Grassroots Leadership Group. The group unsuccessfully supported Mark Norris on the first ballot in his Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta leadership bid. After Norris dropped off the ballot, the group supported eventual winner Ed Stelmach on the second ballot. After the PC leadership process, Grassroots Leadership Group members decided to keep the group together as a business advocacy organization and re-branded as Alberta Enterprise Group, headed by then-Chairman Cal Nichols. In the early days the organization was led by Tim Shipton until his departure to Join the Oilers Entertinment Group (OEG). Tim Shipton was previously director of the Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta. In February, 2019 the organization announced the appointment of John Liston as President. Activities The organization has conducted several meetings over the years trying to draw more business to Canada. In 2008 AEG brought 100 of the province's business leaders to Washington D.C. to meet with congressional leaders and United States business leaders. Then in 2009 the organization brought more than 60 of the province's business leaders to Geneva, Switzerland in an effort to showcase Alberta to the European investment community. In both 2008 and 2009 the organization brought more than 150 businessmen and politicians from across North America to tour the oil sands mining operations. Participants visited Syncrude, Albian and CNRL's Horizon Mine. In the spring of 2010, AEG organized the Alberta Connects outreach mission to Ottawa. Alberta Connects introduced AEG members to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Finance Minister Flaherty, Environment Minister Prentice, Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff and 55 other Members of Parliament and Senators. In 2011, the group returned to Washington, D.C. to engage U.S political leaders in a discussion on improving trade relations between Canada and the United States and ensuring market access for Canadian energy. In 2012, the group brought a delegation of 40 business leaders to Quebec to meet with business and political leaders in that province, purportedly to improve trade ties between the two provinces. In 2015, the group organized a trade mission to British Columbia where it met with British Columbia Energy and Mines Minister Bill Bennett, First Nations Energy & Mining Council CEO Dave Porter, and Iain Black, CEO of the Vancouver Board of Trade and others. A mission highlight was a keynote address by MEG Energy CEO Bill McCaffrey. In 2018 the group organized a trade mission to Nevada. Meeting Governor Sandoval, visiting the largest industrial park in the world, The /Tahoe-Reno Industrial Complex, with tenants such as Telsa, Switch, etc. The organization is a strong proponent of what it calls \\"sustainable resource development,\\" arguing that impediments to resource development imposed by excessive regulation hurt the Canadian economy and government revenues. The group has also been engaged in the discussion on Alberta's provincial budget, advocating spending restraint as opposed to tax increases to address a growing government deficit. =Business taxation advocacy= In April 2015, during the 2015 Alberta general election campaign the group released a study arguing that increasing business taxes would kill jobs and investment, increase consumer prices and reduce wages for workers. =Labour Reform= The organization has also published information regarding collective bargaining. In December 2009 AEG released a study calling for reforms to provincial labour laws, hoping to create good business climates while upholding the collective bargaining rights of workers. The paper argued that the Canada's labour laws lag behind Europe, Australia and the United Kingdom. Some of the recommendations in the study included: having membership cards instead of signing petitions; requiring a quorum, and allowing unionized workers in Alberta be allowed opt out of the portion of their union dues that is spent on lobbying and political activities. The organization supported enacting a Worker Free Choice Act (WFCA) to which would allow workers the right to choose whether or not to join or financially support a union as a condition of employment. Bob Barnetson, who is an associate professor of labour relations at Athabasca University, spoke out against the study's conclusions and how it was conducted. However, the study was endorsed by the Merit Contractors Association, Canadian Constitution Foundation and the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. A survey conducted by AEG also found that 65 percent believed 70 percent of employees should vote to certify or decertify a union. The poll also found that 78 percent agreed that union dues should only be spent on collective bargaining and union management instead of policy influence. =Oil sands= Im May 2011 AEG went to Washington, D.C. to talk about borders security, energy development and trade. Participants met with Members of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate to discuss the pending decision on the Keystone XL pipeline. The meetings noted that tar sands knowledge had increased, discussed Canada's commitment to its environment and the benefits of the oil sands to America. In December 2011, AEG led a counter-boycott of Chiquita Bananas in response to the company signing on to an anti-oil sands campaign coordinated by California-based environmental advocacy group Forest Ethics. Chiquita later said that it would continue to use Canadian oil. Levi-Strauss and Timberland were also targeted by AEG in the boycott of the boycotters, but were later taken down from the page after the companies said they would not boycott Canadian oil.

A converted Lake Maracaibo oil tanker, she took part in the invasions of North Africa, Sicily, and Normandy. Ship history =Design and modifications= Misoa was one of three shallow- draught oil tankers built by the Furness Shipbuilding Company of Haverton Hill-on-Tees in 1937 to operate in Lake Maracaibo in Venezuela. She was requisitioned by the Royal Navy in December 1940, along with her sister ships Tasajera and Bachaquero, for conversion to a tank landing ship. Her oil tanks were removed to form a tank deck, and two large hatches and two 50-ton derrick cranes fitted to lift vehicles from the tank deck to the upper deck. Her bows were cut off square and a heavy steel door fitted. A hinged extension, together with the door, provided a ramp to unload vehicles. Steel armour plate was fitted to the bridge and wheelhouse, and the ship was armed with a single 40 mm gun, six 20 mm anti-aircraft guns, three Lewis machine guns, and a smoke mortar. There was accommodation for up to 217 troops, and for a crew of 98. She could carry eighteen 30-ton tanks, or twenty-two 25-ton tanks, or 33 heavy trucks. After refitting was complete she was commissioned in August 1941. =Initial operations= Misoa left the Clyde in early August 1941 with large squadron of landing and troop ships, escorted by eight destroyers, and headed for Scapa Flow, where four more destroyers joined the convoy, which was intended to seize the Azores. When the operation was cancelled, the ships returned to the Clyde. In January 1942, Misoa was based at Freetown, Sierra Leone, on the South Atlantic Station. =North Africa and the Mediterranean= The ship then took part on \\"Operation Torch\\" - the invasion of North Africa. At 04:00 on 8 November 1942 Misoa, along with Tasajera, and the troopships Durban Castle and Derbyshire, arrived off \\"Z Beach\\" at Arzew, Algeria. By 08:00 she had disembarked M3 Stuart tanks of the U.S. 1st Armored Division's \\"Combat Command B\\", despite coming under fire from nearby enemy battery. The American troops then moved inland to seize the airfields at La Senia and Tafaroui. As the Allied armies advanced Misoa was engaged in transporting men and equipment of the U.S. Army from Algiers to B√¥ne. She was then based at Sousse in Tunisia to provide support for operations involving the British Eighth Army. She also made voyages from Sousse to Malta, carrying munitions and fresh food, following the lifting of the siege. On 10 June 1943 Misoa sailed to the island of Pantellaria, between Sicily and Tunisia, as part of \\"Operation Corkscrew\\". The ship arrived to witness the intensive bombing of the island. By noon the Italian garrison had surrendered, and Misoa landed British tanks unopposed. Later in the day Misoa returned to Sousse to embark men and equipment for the invasion of the islands of Lampedusa and Linosa. Misoa then carried Italian prisoners back to Sousse. A month later Misoa embarked Eighth Army troops and tanks for \\"Operation Husky\\" - the Allied invasion of Sicily - landing them just south of Syracuse on 9‚Äì10 July. For the next two months she made frequent passages to Sousse carrying prisoners, captured tanks and other equipment, and returning with supplies, materials, and men. Following Sicily's fall she continued in this role, supporting operations on the Italian mainland. Following the armistice in September she sailed to the port of Taranto to load captured German and Italian guns, tanks, communications vehicles and half-tracks for transport back to England. =Normandy= Misoa arrived at Plymouth in early January 1944 for repairs and modifications in preparation for the Normandy landings. As well as repairs and general maintenance work, her forward single 40 mm gun was replaced with a twin version, and she was repainted in camouflage colours. Misoa embarked tanks of the Canadian Armoured Corps at Tilbury Docks and sailed for northern France on 4 June 1944. The invasion was then postponed for 24 hours owing to the poor weather, so Misoa remained at sea, finally arriving off \\"Juno Beach\\" at dawn on \\"D-Day\\" 6 June. She disembarked her men, tanks and equipment the following day, and then returned to Tilbury for a second load, returning to \\"Juno\\" to disembark them immediately. Unfortunately a tank slipped sideways off the ramp, blocking it and delaying operations. The tide went out and stranded the ship on the beach until the following morning. Misoa was then anchored off the beachhead and acted as a \\"mother ship\\" to the numerous Motor Torpedo Boats and Motor Gun Boats operating off the beaches, providing accommodation, berths, and medical services. Later, she also provided a repair and maintenance service. By late October Misoa was stationed at Arromanches, until recalled in March 1945. She then sailed for Inveraray, Scotland, where she was decommissioned.

Jonghelinck's Bruegels passed into the possession of the city of Antwerp in the year in which the inventory was made. In 1604 it was recorded in the Prague collections of Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor, then transferred to Vienna, and in 1809 (until 1815) in Paris, requisitioned by Napoleon Bonaparte as part of his war booty.

Christ's insignificance among the crowds is a familiar device of mannerist painting (it recurs in the Preaching of John the Baptist, as well as The Conversion of Paul), as is the artificial placing of Mary and her companions in a rocky foreground, which is deliberately distanced from the dramatic events taking place behind them.Cf. Pietro Allegretti, Brueghel, Milan:Skira (2003) passim. =Details= Detail 1 from top left Bruegel's treatment of landscape evolves in the course of his career from the bird's-eye views and extensive landscapes of the Large landscape series to the remarkable naturalism of the Months. Impossibly sheer outcrops of rock like this one at left characterize the landscape tradition of the Antwerp school founded by Joachim Patinir. Patinir's followers ‚Äì in particular Herri met de Bles, Matthys Cock (the brother of Bruegel's print publisher, Hieronymous Cock) and Cornelis Matsys ‚Äì had turned his style into a popular but stale formula.Cf. Pietro Allegretti, ibid., Milan:Skira (2003). The sequence of Bruegel's landscape drawings and of the landscape in his paintings shows the gradual abandonment of this formula. In this case, however, his desire to convey the rocky, unfamiliar terrain of the Holy Land causes him to fall back on the ready-made landscape features of the Antwerp school.Cf. Mathijs & Jeroon Kock, painters of Antwerp in Karel van Mander's Schilder-boeck, 1604, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature; and Matthys Cock on Artnet Detail 2 from centre right In a detail such as this at right, Bruegel's painting possesses a vividness which would seem to come from his observation of contemporary life.Cf. Pieter Bruegel the Elder , Oxford Art Online. Public executions were a familiar feature of 16th century life, especially in troubled Flanders. Here Bruegel shows the two thieves who were to hang on either side of Christ being trundled to the place of execution. Anachronistically, both clutch crucifixes and are making their final confessions to the cowled priests beside them. The thieves, their confessors and the ghoulish spectators who surround the cart are all in contemporary dress. In Bruegel's day public executions were well attended occasions which had the air of festivals or carnivals. Here Bruegel shows the absolute indifference of the gawping crowds to the fear and misery of the condemned men. (Elsewhere in the picture he shows the pickpockets and the pedlars who preyed upon the crowds at such events.) It is noteworthy that Bruegel makes no distinction between the two thieves, one of whom Christ was to bless. Detail 3 from right margin On the mount of Golgotha (literally, 'place of skulls') the two crosses which are to bear the bodies of the thieves have been erected and a hole is being dug for the cross which is to bear Christ's body, as may be seen in the detail at left. Onlookers on foot and on horseback flock towards this gruesome spot through a landscape dotted with gallows on which corpses still hang and wheels to which fragments of cloth and remnants of broken bodies not eaten by the ravens still cling. Detail 4 from bottom right With the exception of Christ himself, the figures in the procession wear contemporary dress, and there can be no doubts that Bruegel meant his representation of the scene to have a particular reference to his own day. The sacred figures ‚Äì the fainting Virgin assisted by Saint John and the other two Marys (only one of whom is shown here in the detail) ‚Äì are separated from the main events by being placed on a small, rocky plateau. They act out their own, apparently independent, drama, largely unnoticed by the figures behind them. Larger than the background figures and isolated from them, are the Virgin and her companions.Pierra Francastel, Bruegel, Paris:Hazen (1995) Film treatment Michael Francis Gibson wrote an art-historical book entitled The Mill and the Cross, which served as the basis for the 2011 film The Mill and the Cross, directed by Lech Majewski.

She is credited as co-author of a scientific paper on the molecule, which uses computational chemistry to predict that the molecule could actually exist.  Prediction  Science teacher Kenneth Boehr was using ball-and-stick models to represent simple molecules during a fifth-grade class, when ten-year-old Clara Lazen assembled a complex model and asked whether it was a real molecule. It is unclear if Lazen randomly or deliberately assembled this particular molecule. Unsure if the molecule existed, Boehr sent a picture of the model to a chemist friend, Robert Zoellner at Humboldt State University. Zoellner checked the molecule against the Chemical Abstracts database and confirmed that Lazen's model was of a structural type that had not been reported before. Zoellner wrote a paper on the molecule, published in Computational and Theoretical Chemistry, crediting Lazen and Boehr as co-authors. Properties Tetranitratoxycarbon consists of oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon, with molecular structure C(CO3N)4. Its oxygen-rich formula, in particular, a positive oxygen balance, means it does not require any external oxidizer to undergo complete oxidation, and thus may have explosive other high-energy properties. However, it is expected to be too thermally unstable for practical use. The nitratoxycarbon functional group itself‚Äîa carbon atom and a nitrogen atom linked by three oxygen-atom bridges‚Äîhas yet to be observed in any chemical compound. Computational chemistry studies indicate that it is only metastable, with other structural isomers such as the carboxylic nitroso-ester (C(=O)ONO) being more stable. As such this functional group is likely to remain purely hypothetical and no method for its synthesis has yet been proposed. However, several other elementval variations have been synthesized, including the all- carbon analog (bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane).  Possible reactions  Several reactions of tetranitratoxycarbon have been investigated computationally. For example, one possible equation for its decomposition is: :C(CO3N)4 ‚Üí 5 CO2 \\\\+ O2 \\\\+ 2 N2 that is predicted to have a standard enthalpy change of ‚àí1326 kJ/mol based on bond-energy calculation methods. Another potential reaction is its combustion in the presence of oxygen: :C(CO3N)4 \\\\+ O2 ‚Üí 5 CO2 \\\\+ 2 NO2 \\\\+ N2 that is predicted to have a standard enthalpy change of ‚àí1144 kJ/mol.

Howard's sword and sorcery hero Conan the Barbarian and his black counterpart Juma of Kush, a character originally created by L. Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter for their Conan story ‚ÄúThe City of Skulls.‚Äù It was first published in paperback by Tor Books in February 1989, and was reprinted in September 1991 and March 1997. Plot Conan and his friend Juma, both soldiers in the army of Turan, are stationed in the far-off jungles of Venjipoor to defend its beleaguered royal family against the rebellious Hwong tribe. Both comrades are dissatisfied; they and those under them have been doing all the fighting, and see no chance for advancement, as their timid superior officers never risk their own lives in battle. In one skirmish, Conan rescues a girl named Sariya from being sacrificed by Mojurna, an evil shaman. This subsequently leads to trouble, when one of the Turanian officers attempts to rape her and is killed by Conan. There are orders for Conan's execution, but he is the hero of Yaralet and a man whom King Yildiz has his eye on. However, Yildiz's captain devises a plan to get Conan out of circulation for a while by sending him deep into enemy territory. Conan's unit is ambushed, and he calls for reinforcements, only to have his request denied by one of the officers who has it in for him. His men defeat their attackers on their own‚Äîbarely. The wounded Conan is carried back to camp by Juma. Meanwhile, his enemies plan to have him disposed of by their corrupt Venjipoorian allies. Accordingly, Conan is drugged and brought before the duplicitous Pheng Loon, leader of a Venjipoorian tribe the Turanians are supposedly there to help. Despite his hallucinations induced by the drug, Conan is able to throw off its influence and escape. In segments interspersed with those detailing the main action, it's revealed that King Yildiz in Agraphur has his eye on Conan almost literally. His court wizard has kept Yildiz up-to-date on events in Venjipoor by scrying through a magic mirror. Also, the king's known enthusiasm for Conan has both fanned and inhibited his officers' machinations against the Cimmerian. Soon, Yildiz's intervention partiality results in Conan being summoned back to Agraphur for a ceremony. However, bureaucratic delays in his orders give the officers once last chance to try to get him killed. Again, Conan and Juma's forces are sent deep into rebel territory, where they're ambushed by numerically superior foes‚Äîbut again they turn the tide and win. Their enemies now have no choice but to allow them to return to the capital. After a long journey, Conan and Juma reach Agraphur, where King Yildiz gives Conan a medal and names him a Hero of Turan. Days of feasting and revelry ensue, to lead up to an official presentation ceremony. During these festivities, Conan works to uncover the identities of his enemies. Everything comes to a head at the ceremony, where Yildiz is menaced by a carnivorous vine sent by Mojorna. Conan and Juma defend the king against the plant, but delay destroying it long enough for it to consume the corrupt officers whose incompetence has cost so many lives in Venjipoor. Apprised of their plots and soured on foreign conquest, Yildiz commissions the Cimmerian to take over the Turanian forces in Venjipoor and set things right. Back in Venjipoor, Conan shuts down the Turanian mission there. He is aided by the fact that Mojurna died when his plant was destroyed, but this development effectively denies him Sariya, who has taken the shaman's place as leader of the Hwong. Reception Charles Saunders, noting that an Amazon.com reviewer had characterized the novel as ‚ÄúConan in Vietnam‚Äù and \\"accuses Carpenter of loading Conan the Hero with 'every Vietnam cliche in the book,'\\" agrees that \\"the Vietnam references are far from subtle\\" and \\"[t]o anyone familiar with the United States‚Äô involvement with the Vietnam War, the allegory is abundantly ‚Äî and sometimes painfully ‚Äî clear.\\" Nonetheless, he considers that \\"Conan the Hero shows Carpenter's strengths in writing action and detail,\\" noting that \\"[t]he friendship between Conan and Juma comes across as realistic, unlike certain contrived 'interracial-buddy' movies. ... Their ambience is similar to that between the late Robert B. Parker‚Äôs Spenser and Hawk, minus the racial bantering.\\" These things aside, he feels that \\"sometimes, the plot of the novel hangs by the slenderest of threads. Were it not for the Conan-Juma element and the Vietnam allegory, this book would not stand out in the crowd of Conan pastiches. As it is, it only rises about half-a-head above that crowd.\\"Saunders, Charles. \\"Pastiches 'R' Us: Conan the Grunt\\" (Review of Conan the Hero), Mar. 8, 2010.

Benefits of lithium as PFC One of the ongoing research issues for commercial fusion power development is the choice of material for the plasma-facing portions of the reactor vessel, also known as the first wall. Most reactors operate at the equivalent of a high vacuum and thus demand high- strength materials to resists the inward pressure of the magnets against the empty interior. Typical materials are those used in other chemical and atomic processes, like various steel alloys. Unfortunately, these same materials have a number of disadvantages when used in fusion reactors. One major problem is that when escaped fusion fuel hits the material it cools, returning to the fuel mass at a lower temperature and cooling the fuel as a whole. This is known as \\"recycling\\". The other is that these reactions can also spall off metal atoms, and due to their high atomic mass, or \\"high-Z\\", when they are heated they give off copious amounts of X-rays which also cools the plasma fuel. One of the attractive features of a liquid lithium PFC is that it virtually eliminates recycling. This is because lithium has a high chemical reactivity with atomic hydrogen, which is then retained in the PFC. In addition, lithium has a low atomic number, Z. This gives the lowest possible energy loss by radiation from PFC material that may end up in the plasma, because radiation increases strongly with increasing Z. Finally, flowing liquid lithium can also potentially handle the high power densities expected on reactor walls. Tokamak performance All major tokamaks have obtained their best performance under low recycling conditions. If a fully non- recycling wall can be achieved, theory predicts that the basic nature of magnetic confinement will be changed. The temperature and density profiles, and plasma current distributions, would potentially eliminate deleterious plasma instabilities. Furthermore, the transport mechanisms causing the loss of energy and particles would be reduced, and plasmas with higher energy confinement could result. CDX-U PPPL scientist at CDX-U Operated at PPPL from 2000 to 2005. As the first test of large area liquid lithium PFC, CDX-U had a toroidal tray on the bottom of the vacuum chamber to contain the lithium. Even with this partial non-recycling PFC, major improvements in plasma performance were obtained. Impurities were reduced, and a dramatic improvement (x6) in energy confinement was observed in 2005. Conversion of CDX-U to LTX To achieve more a complete non-recycling PFC, the CDX-U vacuum vessel was disassembled for the installation of a heated inner shell inside it. This was a major step for the conversion of CDX-U to LTX. LTX had its first plasma in 2008, and first run with lithium wall coatings in 2010.The Lithium Tokamak Experiment (LTX) Fact Sheet =Construction= The shell was fabricated out of 3/8‚Äù copper sheets, which had a stainless steel liner explosively bonded to it. The stainless steel plasma-facing surface of the inner LTX shell will be coated with lithium between shots, using an electron beam evaporator. By keeping the shell temperature above the melting point of lithium, 90% of the LTX PFC area (~5 m2) will consist of non-recycling liquid lithium. LTX-Œ≤ From 2016 to 2019 LTX was upgraded to become LTX-Œ≤.Machine set to see if lithium can help bring fusion to Earth May 2019 The upgrade increased the magnetic field by about two thirds, and added 500 kW of neutral beam injector heating.

Facing the Atlantic Ocean, it lies 1 kilometre north-west of the village of Zennor and 1.6 kilometres east of the next promontory, Gurnard's Head. The granite (Killas) cliffs rise over from the sea and the highest point of the headland is above sea level, with an Ordnance Survey triangulation station. Zennor Head is on the South West Coast Path, which follows the cliff edge closely, skirting the entire perimeter of the headland. The promontory is part of the Penwith Heritage Coast, and is the largest coastal feature in the United Kingdom that begins with the letter \\"Z\\". It gets its name from a local saint, Senara. Zennor Head was mined for copper and tin in the Victorian Era. There is no longer any residential or commercial occupancy on the headland, but it is occupied by a variety of coastal animals and plants, such as kestrels and gorse. Etymology The name \\"Zennor Head\\" originates from the name of a local saint, Senara. According to local legend, Senara was thrown off a headland in Brittany in a barrel after being falsely accused of adultery by her husband and washed up on the Cornish coast, founding Zennor and giving her name to the eponymous village (and subsequently Zennor Head, Zennor Quoit and Porthzennor Cove), before continuing to Ireland. The \\"s\\" changed to a \\"z\\", an occurrence common in the West Country but rare elsewhere, and as such is the largest coastal feature in the United Kingdom to begin with the letter \\"Z\\". History Plaque commemorating donation to the National Trust The headland is bordered by Cornish granite hedges, and the farming system dates from about 4000 BC, the time of the Bronze Age in Cornwall. The surrounding area and village of Zennor has been continually occupied for over 4,000 years. Zennor Head was mined extensively for copper and tin in the 19th century, and drainage adits remain visible on the eastern side. The promontory was donated to the National Trust in December 1953. The Southwest Coast Path was created in 1978, and runs along the top of Zennor Head as part of its ,Zennor Head Walk ‚Äì National Trust, retrieved 30 October 2012 following the edge of the cliffs closely. Zennor in Darkness, the 1994 McKitterick Prize-winning novel by Helen Dunmore, was partly set around Zennor Head. In 2009 the headland suffered flooding which affected the cliff-top footpath. The promontory has been designated as part of the Penwith Heritage Coast. Geography and geology Zennor Head is located on the north coast of Cornwall, England, facing the Atlantic Ocean. A headland extending some , it is surrounded by steep cliffs plunging into the sea below. It is west of the town of St Ives, and north-east of the town of Penzance. The nearest human settlement is the village of Zennor, and the headland is flanked by two coves, Pendour and Porthzennor.

Boudreau (born December 30, 1949) is an American football coach who last served as offensive line coach for the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League (NFL). He has served as the offensive line coach for eight different NFL teams, one Canadian Football League (CFL) team, and four college teams. No offensive line coach in the NFL has more experience as an assistant at the professional level than Boudreau, who entered his 29th season in 2015. Boudreau's stellar offensive lines over the years have helped pave the way for five running backs to top the 10,000-yard career rushing mark, including Barry Sanders, Curtis Martin, Thurman Thomas, Fred Taylor and Steven Jackson. This is his second stint with the Rams organization, having previously coached them in the 2006 and 2007 seasons. Biography =Early years= Raised in Arlington, Massachusetts, Boudreau played offensive line at Arlington High School. Boudreau attended Bordentown Military Institute in Bordentown, New Jersey starting in 1967, where he played offensive guard and defensive tackle. He received All-Prep honors from the Newark Star Ledger for the 1968 season, and graduated in 1969. Boudreau was widely recruited, but returned to Massachusetts and played for Boston College under coach Joe Yukica as an offensive lineman from 1971 until his graduation in 1973. =Coaching career= Boudreau began his coaching career as an assistant at Oxford High School in Oxford, Massachusetts. He then joined his alma mater where he specialized as the offensive line coach from 1974‚Äì1975. He continued as the offensive line coach at other colleges including the University of Maine (1976‚Äì78), Dartmouth College (1979‚Äì81), and the United States Naval Academy (1982). He then joined the Edmonton Eskimos staff in the Canadian Football League and was the offensive line coordinator from 1983‚Äì1986.New Orleans Saints Media Guide ‚Äì 1992 Boudreau's first position in the NFL was with the New Orleans Saints. In his seven seasons with the Saints, his offensive line placed in the top three in fewest sacks allowed on four occasions. In 1992, the Saints allowed a league-low 15 sacks. He then joined the Detroit Lions, under head coach Wayne Fontes, where his offensive line helped Barry Sanders rush for over 1,500 yards each season, and almost 5,000 yards total over three seasons. In the 1997 and 1998 seasons, Boudreau coached the offensive line for the New England Patriots under head coach Pete Carroll. Jimmy Johnson brought Boudreau to the Miami Dolphins for the 1999 season. Johnson eventually resigned in January 2000 and was replaced by assistant head coach and defensive coordinator Dave Wannstedt, but Boudreau remained on the staff. In July, at the age of 50, Boudreau took a short medical leave of absence for kidney surgery. When he returned for the 2000 season, his offensive line allowed only 28 sacks, the fourth best in the NFL. In January 2001, Boudreau joined the Carolina Panthers, whose previous offensive line coach Tony Wise coincidentally accepted Boudreau's job in Miami. The Panthers had previously allowed a season high 69 sacks. For the 2001 season, Boudreau's offensive line set a club record of 31 sacks, which ranked 11th in the NFL, although the Panthers still finished with a 1-15 record. In 2002, the offensive line allowed 44 sacks, and the team finished 7-9. When Panthers defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio became the head coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars, Boudreau followed and served as the offensive line coach from 2003‚Äì2005; he also reunited with offensive coordinator and former Saints colleague Carl Smith. In 2003, his offensive line set a franchise record of 28 sacks allowed, ninth in the NFL, and running back Fred Taylor set a team rushing record of 1,572 yards. Scott Linehan brought Boudreau in as offensive line coach for the St. Louis Rams for the 2006 and 2007 seasons. In 2006, his offensive line allowed running back Steven Jackson to rush a career best 1,528 yards. In 2008, Boudreau became the offensive line coach for the Atlanta Falcons under head coach Mike Smith. The Falcons drafted highly touted and former fellow Boston College Eagle, Matt Ryan. Boudreau's line assisted running back Michael Turner in attaining a career high 1,699 rushing yards. Although the Falcons had winning records of 11-5, 9-7, 13-3, and 10-6 respectively, they failed to win a playoff game during this period, and Boudreau was released. For the 2012 season, Paul Boudreau returned to St. Louis as the offensive line coach, but under a new head coach, Jeff Fisher. The Rams finished the 2012 season with a record of 7-8-1, with the tie coming against the eventual NFC champions and division rival, San Francisco 49ers. The 2013 season saw the Rams finish the season with a 7-9 record. In 2014, the Rams used their number 2 overall pick on offensive lineman, Greg Robinson, of Auburn. The Rams finished the season with a 6-10 record despite losing starting quarterback Sam Bradford to injury and splitting time between backups Shaun Hill and Austin Davis. In 2015, the Rams allowed the fewest sacks in the league (18) and finished seventh in the NFL in rushing yards per game. Personal life Paul Boudreau met his wife Joan in Boston College. They have two children. Paul F. Boudreau (aka Paul Boudreau Jr.) attended Boston College, and is a former Assistant Special Teams Coach for the St. Louis Rams. Jill Boudreau is the mother of four children.

The movement is mostly made up of ethnic Tuareg, some of whom are believed to have fought in the Libyan army during the 2011 Libyan Civil War (though other Tuareg MNLA fighters were on the side of the National Transitional Council and returned to Mali after that war). The movement was founded in October 2011 and had stated that it includes other Saharan peoples. The Malian government has accused the movement of having links to Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. The MNLA denies this claim. By 1 April 2012 the MNLA and Ansar Dine were in control of virtually all of northern Mali, including its three largest cities of Kidal, Gao, and Timbuktu. Tensions between the MNLA and Ansar Dine culminated in the Battle of Gao, in which the MNLA lost control of northern Malian cities to Ansar Dine and the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa. History Since 1916 there have been at least five Tuareg rebellions. After the failure of the 2007‚Äì2009 rebellion in northern Niger and Mali, some Tuareg fighters left for Libya where they were integrated into the Libyan Army. At the end of 2011, following the defeat of Libyan Arab Jamahiriya several Tuareg from the Libyan Army and the rebel National Transitional Council returned to the Azawad regions of northern Mali. Many fighters returned from Libya for either financial reasons, such as losing their savings, or due to the alleged racism of NTC fighters and militias. The MNLA was said to have been formed after a fusion of such groups as the Northern Mali Tuareg Movement. An alleged influx of arms intended for rebels in Libya led to a huge cache in the largely ungoverned desert areas around where the Tuareg live and causing concern that much of the heavy weaponry remains unaccounted for and could be sold to the highest bidder. Though some analysis has denied the connections to either Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) or Muammar Gaddafi and the Libyan Civil War, although the potency of this rebellion was still read as being influenced from weapons from Libya, as well as leftovers from previous rebellions in Azawad and even from Mali's army which were taken by defecting Arab and Tuareg personnel. The group is considered to be secular. The Tuareg fighters within the ranks of the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad have been considered former allies of Muammar Gaddafi which may have organized after the Tuareg Rebellion between 2007 and 2009. MNLA's adopted flag for Azawad. They have also been accused by the government of Mali of cooperating with AQIM. The MNLA have denied this claim. The MNLA was founded in October 2011; though it is sometimes considered to have been founded more than a year earlier in relation to other such groups. The MNLA have presented themselves as a movement for the liberation of all the peoples of Azawad (Songhai, Arab, Fula and Tuareg). There were also rumours that the group has been supported by battle-hardened Tuaregs from Niger. On the subject of its composition, the MNLA has declared: =Factionalism= The MNLA was rumoured to have factionalised, according to the sources in the Malian government, with the Islamist Ansar Dine claiming control of the region after the capture of several cities, previously attributed to the MNLA. Though the international media has linked the MNLA to Ansar Dine and AQIM, the MNLA has distanced itself from both groups, stating that their sole goal is the independence of Azawad. However, after the fall of Timbuktu it said that Azawad would be governed along with Ansar Dine. On 26 May, the MNLA and Ansar Dine announced a pact in which they would merge to form an Islamist state, renamed the Islamic Republic of Azawad. =Independence fight= MNLA launched its armed campaign in January 2012 to free three regions of Mali from the central government's control and seeking the independence of Azawad. The MNLA's fight is for their claim of Malian Azawad. (Area captured is indicated.) In January, its fighters attacked And√©ramboukane, Menaka, Tessalit, Niafunke, and Aguelhoc. They were reported to be in control of parts of northern Mali, such as Menaka on 1 February. During that time the movement was said to have opened a fifth front in the town of Lere. At the end of January, they claimed to have shot down a Malian Air Force Mig-21 with the surface-to-air missiles acquired from NATO arms drops over Libya. The military of Mali have also used helicopter gunships to target the group. On 4 February 2012, the movement's fighters attacked government forces in Kidal with the aim of taking control of the town and occupying the two military bases there. Further towns were seized and re- seized over the course of February and March. At the same time, following clashes in the north, Tuareg civilians were said to have left Bamako for fear of reprisals. The International Committee of the Red Cross also said that 3,500 people had fled across the border to Mauritania and that 10,000 people had crossed into Niger during the clashes. On 8 February 2012, Tinzawaten was wrested from central government control after Malian troops took a \\"tactical withdrawal\\" following the death of one soldier and injuries to two other soldiers, amid calls by the United Nations for a halt to the offensive. One rebel was also killed and another was wounded, while the MNLA seized two military bases and the weapons storages there. The ICRC added that there were 30,000 internally displaced persons, while the UN said that over 20,000 people have fled to Burkina Faso, Algeria and Mauritania. The United Nations also warned of food shortages as a result of the fighting. The UN refugee agency estimated 22,000 people had been displaced in February.\\"Malian refugees in Niger await food and water,\\" AlJazeera (7 February 2012) The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) planned to send a team to investigate the violence. It also condemned their actions and called for logistical support for Mali. After the March coup d'etat the MNLA, as well as Ansar Dine, took control of several small towns and also the bigger cities of Kidal, Gao, and Timbuktu. Timbuktu was read by Reuters of being the culmination of the plan to capture northern Mali. The MNLA announced that by taking Timbuktu it sought to \\"dislodge Mali's remaining political and military administration\\" in the region and said that it would rule the region with Ansar Dine in opposition to the administration in Bamako. On 6 April, in an interview with France 24, an MNLA spokesman declared the independence of Azawad as an independent state and said the movement would act as a provisional administration until the establishment of a government. In the same interview, Attaher also promised that Azawad would \\"respect all the colonial frontiers that separate Azawad from its neighbours\\" and insisted that Azawad's declaration of independence has \\"some international legality\\". Two days following the declaration of independence, the Arab-dominated National Liberation Front of Azawad (FLNA) were formed to defend Timbuktu from alleged Tuareg domination. =Conflict with Islamist groups= Although both the MNLA and the various Islamist groups fought against a common foe (the Malian government) in the beginning of the conflict, there were deep ideological differences between them. The goal of the MNLA, to establish a secular and independent state of Azawad out of Northern Mali, contrasted sharply with the aims of the Islamist groups, who wanted a united Mali under Sharia law. Once the Malian government's forces had been evicted the region, the two ideological camps began to turn against each other. On 26 May, the MNLA and Ansar Dine announced a pact in which they would merge to form an Islamist state. However, some later reports indicated the MNLA had decided to withdraw from the pact, distancing itself from Ansar Dine. On 26 June 2012, the tension came to all-out combat in Gao between the MNLA and the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa (MOJWA), with both sides firing heavy weapons. MNLA Secretary General Bilal ag Acherif was wounded in the battle. The MNLA were soon driven from the city, and from Kidal and Timbuktu shortly after. However, the MNLA stated that it continued to maintain forces and control some rural areas in the region. The following day, Ansar Dine announced that it was in control of all the cities of northern Mali. Ansar Dine and MNLA delegates in Ouagadougou with Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaor√©, 16 November 2012. At first, the MNLA retained control of the city of M√©naka, with hundreds of people taking refuge in the city from the rule of the Islamists, and the city of near the Algerian border. In the same month, a splinter group broke off from the MNLA; calling itself the Front for the Liberation of the Azawad (FPA), stating that Tuareg independence was no longer a realistic goal and that they must concentrate on fighting the Islamists. On 16 November 2012, MNLA forces launched an offensive against Gao in an attempt to retake the town. However, by the end of the day, the Tuaregs were beaten back by the MOJWA forces after the Islamists laid an ambush for them. On 19 November 2012, MOJWA and AQIM forces took over M√©naka from the MNLA.\\"North Mali clashes kill dozens, some unarmed: source\\" Google News (AFP), 20 November 2012 On 14 January 2013, after the French intervention in the conflict had commenced, the MNLA declared it would fight alongside the French and even the Malian government to \\"end terrorism in Azawad\\". At the same time the MNLA warned the Malian forces not to enter territories it considered its own before an autonomy agreement was signed. The spokesman also declared that the MNLA would be a more effective force than those of the neighboring West African nations \\"because of our knowledge of the ground and the populations\\". =Return of Malian troops to Azawad= Following the French intervention in Mali, Malian troops and the MNLA signed a peace agreement. This allowed for Malian troops to return to such cities as Kidal. There were still reports of conflict between those who supported the presence of the 200 Malian soldiers at a local barracks and those that supported the MNLA, who sought to keep Malian soldiers out. Kidal's Deputy Mayor Abda Ag Kazina said: \\"The Malian army arrived in Kidal. There were two demonstrations, one was to support the army and the other was to prevent the army from returning. There were shots fired in the air and the protesters dispersed.\\" On 28 November 2013, after a few hundreds Tuareg protesters were violently confronted by Malian soldiers over the visit of Malian Prime Minister Oumar Tatam Ly to MNLA-controlled Kidal, one of the MNLA founders, Attaye Ag Mohamed, said: \\"The political and military wings of the Azawad declare the lifting of the ceasefire with the central government in Bamako. All our military positions are on alert.\\" Organisation =Leadership= One of the founding leaders was said to be Moussa Ag Acharatoumane. Another influential leader in the group was Ibrahim Ag Bahanga (as well as his father-in-law Hama Ag Sid'Ahmed, who was also a spokesman for a group in the previous rebellion) from the 1990 and 2006 rebellions. After he was defeated and forced into exile in Libya, he was said to have met with other leaders of the 1990 rebellion who had taken up posts in a new unit of the Libyan army to fight desert warfare. Ibrahim sought to have a proficient force to fight against the Malian state and outside the media spotlight. He was killed on 26 August 2011. One of the officers he had met in Libya was Colonel Ag Mohamed Najem, who is said by the movement to be the head of its military wing. He is of Malian origin but resigned from the Libyan Army shortly after the uprising to join the Tuareg rebellion in Mali. Colonel Dilal Ag Alsherif is another military leader of the movement. There are said to be about 40 officers in the MNLA movement. There are also deserters from the Malian Army, including officers. Colonel Nagim is one such officer, who led the charge to capture two cities. The General Secretary of the movement is Bilal Ag Acherif. The spokesman for the MNLA's political wing is Hama Ag Mahmoud. Following the independence declaration, Mahmoud Ag Aghaly was appointed as the head of the interim Executive Committee of the MNLA that was said to govern Azawad. =Armed forces and equipment= Following their victory over the Malian army, the MNLA established their main base at the airport of Gao where they had stocked 30 functional tanks and 10 being repaired. An unnamed commander of the MNLA said that at the beginning they were mainly armed from weapons brought by fighters returning from Libya, but that later of their equipment was seized from the Malian army. Split-off Ibrahim Ag Mohamed Assaleh, a former external relations representative of the MNLA, split off from the party in March 2014 and formed the Coalition for the People of Azawad. He was said to be frustrated at the hardline negotiations position Bilal Ag Acherif took when dealing with the Malian government.

Life and works Niedling was raised in Erfurt and lives in Berlin.Biography on the website of Hamish Morison Galerie . His works revolve around the construction of history, the traces that history left in the collective mind.

In particular, \\"Mein letztes Jahr\\" (My last year), in which Niedling, implementing a drill by Ingo Niermann, consistently lived for one year in the period from 1 March 2011 to 29 February 2012, as if it were his last.Kito Nedo: Niedling In: Frieze, 13 February 2012. This was followed by exhibitions and publications dealing with his artistic and biographical estate as well as the further realisation of the pyramid mountain. On 8 May 2017, Niedling performed a ritual possession (Seizure) of the mountain Kleiner Gleichberg in the district of Hildburghausen (Thuringia) for the first time, where since then the \\"Burial of the White Man\\" festival has been held on the mountain every 8 May.

Fletcher (November 5, 1831 ‚Äì March 12, 1882) was a British-born American attorney, civic leader, politician, and government land agent in the Washington Territory. He served on the city council of Vancouver, Washington, and eventually became mayor. Early years life and education Fletcher was born on November 5, 1831 in England. As a child, his family immigrated to the United States, settling in the state of Maryland. Fletcher and his wife, Rhoda, left Maryland and moved west to Vancouver in June 1861. They purchased two lots near St. Luke's Episcopal Church and built a house there. The Fletchers joined the parish at St. Luke's, with Rhoda being baptized by Reverend John D. McCarty in 1861.  Career  In 1861, President Abraham Lincoln appointed Fletcher as Register of the Vancouver, Washington Territory branch of the General Land Office. The General Land Office was charged with administrating the conveyance of public lands to those claiming the lands as a part of homesteading or otherwise, in the form of a Land patent. For a new territory, this office was at the center of the local business development efforts. At St. Luke's, Fletcher was an active leader of the parish. He was one of the incorporators when St. Luke's became the first Episcopal Church in the Washington Territory to be incorporated. He served on the Vestry, along with other civic and military leaders including Louis Sohns, Henry C. Hodges, and John McNeil Eddings, and was the Senior Warden when the church was consecrated in 1868 by Benjamin Wistar Morris (bishop). Typically Senior Wardens only serve for a few years, yet Joseph Fletcher served from 1868 through 1875, and again in 1881, working with the church's second rector, Reverend Albert S. Nicholson. He also served as the Superintendent of Sunday School during this period. Perhaps not as notable as some would like, but in perspective to his many other duties and activities during this time, it illustrates his commitment to service as well as popularity amongst his peers. Practicing both as an attorney and land office agent, Fletcher quickly became involved in local civic and political affairs. On June 25, 1862, the Clarke County Committee of the Union Convention elected Fletcher to be a part of this committee. He participated in writing their announcement that \\"dissolution of the Union was unfounded and unwarranted.\\" In 1863 he was indicated on a stock certificate as being the Corporate Secretary for the Columbia Transportation Company. The company was in business to transport people from the east coast to the west coast of the United States during the Gold Rush. The company would pick up and deliver passengers traveling on the Panama Railroad in South America and bring them to California and the Washington Territory. On October 7, 1865, Fletcher was the secretary of a public meeting held in Vancouver to discuss bringing Union soldier orphans to Vancouver On October 31, 1865, a small group of local men proposed themselves as a slate for the upcoming city elections. They called themselves the \\"People's Ticket\\". Fletcher was a member of that group. Local reaction was sharply against this action, and a convention of the local Union Party (Republican) was convened. Interesting enough, many on the People's Ticket were also in attendance, and Fletcher was elected Secretary by the convention. The Union Party selected a separate slate for the city elections, which included about half of the other slate, as well as Mr. Fletcher. It would seem that Fletcher was able to politically navigate a delicate 'storm' successfully. On November 11, 1865, Mr. Fletcher joined the Common Council of Vancouver, and became its recording clerk also. Fletcher was known as a gifted and humorous speaker and writer. For instance, in writing about the local Fourth of July celebrations, the newspaper said of him, \\"Mr. Fletcher is one of our readiest off-hand speakers\\". In November 1869, Fletcher was elected Mayor of Vancouver. He served for two years in that position. In November, 1872, Fletcher was elected Prosecuting Attorney for the 2nd Judicial District. He also served on numerous commissions associated with town and county administration, including the Board of Townsite Commissioners in 1878. Fletcher was known for his sense of humor as well as writing and speaking abilities. As an attorney, Fletcher dealt with a wide variety of clients and cases. One of his advertisements in 1875 shows a \\"particular attention to conveyancing and examination of land titles.\\" In 1881, Fletcher was elected once again to be the Senior Warden at St. Luke's. As such, he would have participated in the arrangements for the First Convocation of the Protestant Episcopal Church of the Missionary Jurisdiction of Washington (the precursor to the Episcopal Diocese of Olympia). The convocation was held at St. Luke's on August 24, 1881. Noted in a copy of the proceedings is that Fletcher also served on the Diocesan Board of Missions, and was the Treasurer of that board. Personal life Fletcher and his wife Rhoda had three children. Lizzie was born in October, 1862, Alice was born in June, 1865, and William was born in 1868. William died at the age of nine months, in October, 1868. One month later, on November 5, 1868, Rhoda Fletcher died. The brief obituary in the newspaper noted that Rhoda was 31 and died of \\"disease of the brain\\". Joseph was so grief-stricken that he sold his house and lots, fully furnished, to St. Luke's as a parsonage, at a low price for the time, just one month later. Alice died years later. On May 8, 1869 Fletcher posted a notice in the local paper saying that he would be going \\"back East\\" for two months, and that the duties of Land Register would be handled by the Land Receiver in the office. When he returned to Vancouver, Fletcher was married to a widow from Maryland, Sara Kidwell, who had two children, Clara and Robert. Robert F. Kidwell died on June 21, 1876. A memorial window was installed in St. Luke's in Robert's memory by his family. On October 7, 1880, during a visit to Vancouver by President Rutherford B. Hayes, Fletcher was called upon to make an impromptu speech. He honored the school children and orphans assembled to meet and sing to the President. This was typical of his interest and support for children, singing, and education throughout his life. Disappearance and death In 1881, Fletcher became the Corporate Secretary for the People's Transportation Company. This steamer riverboat company, located at the main wharf of Vancouver, provided freight and person transportation daily on the Columbia River The local newspaper continued to indicate that Fletcher was involved, as attorney, in numerous of cases, often related to land disputes, however also dealing with other community matters. One set of cases mentioned in 1881 concerned his representation for a number of plaintiffs against the Cascade Rail Road Company, in a land dispute amounting to over $100,000. On March 2, 1882, the local newspaper mentioned that \\"The Columbia River is rising lively occasioned by the late heavy rains.\\" In the same column it stated \\"Yesterday Joseph M. Fletcher lost on the street a roll of greenbacks amounting to $170 which he was fortunate enough to find again a short time afterwards.\\" On March 23, 1882, Fletcher was reported missing by the local paper, The Vancouver Independent. It was reported that he was last seen the previous Wednesday in the vicinity of his office, at Fifth and Main Street, at seven- thirty at night, walking toward the river. He was last seen wearing a beaver coat, white shirt with pearl studs and tie, and fine leather boots. There was no reason to suspect any problems with his affairs according to his friends and business associates. The local Masonic Lodge, of which he was a longtime member and officer, offered a reward for information about his disappearance. A local newspaper reported that he was near-sighted and had left his home without his glasses, something that he had never done before. The paper also reported that his financial situation was in order, and so was the accounting at the People's Transportation Company, of which he was the Secretary. On September 7, 1882, the Vancouver Independent reported that Fletcher's body was found downstream in the Columbia River. Although the body showed signs of long-term water exposure, he was still dressed in the same clothes he had last been seen wearing. Because the local coroner was not available, no autopsy was completed. An inquest panel determined that his death was by drowning, although the cause was never officially confirmed.

History  The oil painting \\"The sortie of Aris\\", by Konstantinos Volanakis The figurehead of Aris, today in the National Historical Museum, Athens The 350-ton Aris was constructed as a merchant vessel in Venice in 1807. Upon the outbreak of the Greek Revolution in March 1821, her owner, Anastasios Tsamados (1774-1825) from Hydra, armed the ship with 16 12-pounder guns and joined the fleet of his home island. Aris participated in many of the early naval clashes with the Ottoman Navy, but became famous after the action fought at Navarino on , which became known as the \\"Sortie of Aris\\" (ŒàŒæŒøŒ¥ŒøœÇ œÑŒøœÖ ŒÜœÅŒµœâœÇ). = Sphacteria = At that time, a Greek garrison was quartered at the island at Sphacteria, which controlled the entrance of the excellent natural harbour of the Bay of Pylos (Navarino). Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt, tasked by the Ottoman sultan to suppress the Greek revolt, needed to take the island in order to use the bay for his own purposes. Aris, along with 5 other brigs, were anchored at Sphacteria when, on the morning of April 26, the combined Ottoman-Egyptian fleet arrived and started its attack on the island, bombarding the Greek positions and disembarking numerous troops. Most captains of the ships were on land, along with part of their crews, who were manning the island's cannons. The other ships sailed before the Ottoman fleet could seal off the bay, and after fighting off the Ottomans, were able to escape. The crew of Aris however still awaited their captain, who had been killed. Instead, Nikolaos Votsis, the captain of the Athena, which had already sailed without him, and Dimitrios Sachtouris, the commander of the Navarino fortress, came aboard, fleeing the advancing Egyptian soldiers. Votsis took over as captain, with Sachtouris as his first mate, and set sail. Also present on the ship was the Secretary of State, Alexandros Mavrokordatos, who was sent to the hold for safety. Aris sailed through the midst of the Turco-Egyptian fleet, being attacked on all sides for several hours and facing in total 32 ships one after another, before reaching the open sea. Casualties among the crew were just two dead and six wounded. = After the Revolution = After the end of the War of Independence, the ship was bought by the Greek government for the new Royal Hellenic Navy and renamed Athena (ŒëŒ∏Œ∑ŒΩŒ¨). It reverted to its old name in 1879, and was in service, mainly as a training vessel for the Hellenic Naval Academy, until , when it was ceremonially sunk off Salamis with full honours on the 100th anniversary of the Greek Revolution. The action, justified on the grounds of the expense involved in the ship's maintenance, caused much criticism at the time from those who favoured her retention as a naval monument. Today, only the ship's figurehead is preserved, at the National Historical Museum of Athens.

The title was eventually changed to Abroad with Two Yanks. Small later said he mainly bought the story because this title was so appealing. In January 1944 Edward Small announced the film would be his next for United Artists. Lou Beslow and John Twist were writing the script and Lew Seiler was borrowed from 20th Century Fox to direct. However, by February Allan Dwan, who had just made Up in Mabel's Room for Small, had been signed to direct Anna Lee was meant to play the female lead. She accepted the part while in Las Vegas for her divorce proceedings. However, on returning to Hollywood she decided that the part was not suitable for her and pulled out of the film.
