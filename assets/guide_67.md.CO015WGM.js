People who are in poverty have different health risks than those who are not considered in poverty, as well as different outcomes associated with those risks. People who are in poverty grapple with varying outcomes in physical health, mental health, and access to healthcare. Examining divergences in health between those above and below the poverty line gives insight into conditions for those who live in poverty.  Poverty and physical health  Poverty affects health outcomes throughout a person's entire life cycle. The insidious component is that the negative result may not be expressed while the person is impoverished. Mothers who are in poverty during their pregnancies may experience more health risks during their delivery, more health risks to their newborn, and markedly more behavioral problems for their child later on. If a child is in poverty, they will have worse health outcomes during their adulthood. This is especially pronounced for specufic ailments, such as heart disease and diabetes. This effect is present even if a person escapes poverty during adulthood, suggesting a lasting effect of the stress of poverty encountered during childhood or adolescence. Likewise, if an adult lives within an area deemed poverty-dense, they will have worse health outcomes, on average, than their peers who live in neighborhoods with less poverty. This result is observed after controlling for factors like age, race, and lifestyle choices. This suggests that the unique stresses of life within an impoverished community contribute to poorer health outcomes, without any assumed detrimental behavior on the part of the resident.  Poverty and mental health  Poverty also has a complex relationship with mental health. Being in poverty may itself provoke a condition of elevated emotional stress, known as “poverty distress”. Poverty is also a precursor or risk factor for mental illness, particularly mood disorders, such as depression and anxiety. Schizophrenia is also strongly associated with poverty, occurring most frequently in the poorest classes of people all over the world, especially in more unequal countries. In a sort of reciprocating relationship, having mental illness is a major risk factor for being in poverty. Having a mental illness may inhibit a person's ability to work or deter employees from hiring them. A hypothesis known as “drift hypothesis”, posits that for people with psychiatric disorders (primarily schizophrenia), they tend to fall further down the socio-economic ladder as their condition reduces their functionality. This hypothesis is an effort to establish that people with profoundly limiting psychiatric symptoms are more likely to descend economically, not that the financially challenged are more likely to present severe psychiatric disorders. People experiencing less severe symptoms are less likely to be affected by “drift”. Receiving treatment has shown positive effects for those struggling with mental illness and poverty. With those in poverty having greater likelihood of suffering from mental illness, the benefit of access to clinical psychotherapy treatments has been explored. Despite numerous barriers for access to care for low-income individuals, there is evidence that those who do receive care respond with significant improvements. This research supports policy measures for improved outreach and access-to-care measures designed to benefit those with low- incomes and mental health disorders.  Health care effects  Between 1987 and 2005, the number of people without health insurance in the United States rose from just over 30 million, to 46.6 million. At that time, 8.5% of people belonging to households that made over $75,000 annually were uninsured. For families earning $25,000 or less, that percentage rose to 24.4% uninsured. This figure exhibits how lack of access to care via health insurance disproportionately affects those in poverty. Demonstrators rallying for healthcare reform. Despite the cost of healthcare being an obstacle for those with relatively low incomes, research suggests that insurance coverage will not dramatically change outcomes related to physical health. Access to Medicaid for low-income adults aided in diagnosis of metabolic disease, saw a reduction in diagnosis of mental health disorders, and reduced incurrence of “catastrophic medical costs” by patients dramatically. While these positive effects were observed, outcomes for heart disease, diabetes, and other physical health characteristics were not meaningfully improved. It has been posited that one year, the duration of the study, is an insufficient length to fully observe the divergent health outcomes that would be characteristic of an experiment with a lengthier time-table.

It was described from New Caledonia. Description Gasteracantha gambeyi is known from a single 19th century description of a female specimen. French naturalist Eugène Simon described a specimen with an abdomen measuring 15.5 millimeters wide by 8.5 millimeters long, with three pairs of short (2 millimeters), black, and widely spaced spines around the abdomen. These spines were covered with small tubercles. Simon described the upper surface of the abdomen as a bright, clear red-brown color with black sigilla and transverse black bands, the anterior band broken in the middle. In 1914, Friedrich Dahl synonymized G. gambeyi with Gasteracantha rubrospinis, musing, however, that G. gambeyi might be a species between G. rubrospinis and Gasteracantha fasciata. The World Spider Catalog does not follow Dahl in this case and retains G. gambeyi as a distinct species in the catalog.

Three were able to escape but one was shot to death. Background The East St. Louis massacres were a series of outbreaks of labor and race- related violence by people that caused the deaths of an estimated 40–250 African Americans in late May and early July 1917. Another 6,000 blacks were left homeless, and the rioting and vandalism cost approximately $400,000 ($ in ) in property damage. These race riots were one of several incidents of civil unrest that started again in the so-called American Red Summer of 1919. Terrorist attacks on black communities and white oppression in over three dozen cities and counties. In most cases, white mobs attacked African American neighborhoods. In some cases, black community groups resisted the attacks, especially in Chicago and Washington DC. Most deaths occurred in rural areas during events like the Elaine Race Riot in Arkansas, where an estimated 100 to 240 black people and 5 white people were killed. Also in 1919 were the Chicago Race Riot and Washington D.C. race riot which killed 38 and 39 people respectively. Both had many more non-fatal injuries and extensive property damage reaching into the millions of dollars. In addition to this racial tension, the United States' media were alarmed by terrorist attacks from radical left extremist groups. On November 16, 1919 A. Mitchell Palmer released a report about the dangers of the far left and that “The negro race,” he warns, was “fertile ground” for the spread of radical propaganda. He launched a campaign against radicalism known as the Palmer Raids in November 1919. Federal agents supported by local police rounded up large groups of suspected radicals, often based on membership in a political group rather than any action taken. Lynching In November 1919 in Moberly, Missouri four African Americans allegedly beat and robbed white farmer Edward Thompson, The Dallas Express reported that Thompson had only light injuries. Four African Americans, identified as Allie Richards, George Adams, Sanfard Taylor, and James Anderson, were arrested on Thursday, November 14, 1919, and held in the nearby Macon, Missouri. It was reported in the press that the four were Industrial Workers of the World (I.W.W.) members and it was claimed that they were from Chicago. Hundreds of men formed a white mob and threatened to bomb the Macon jail unless the four were handed over. Macon's Sheriff Jesse Stamper folded and instructed his deputy, Bob Epperson to give the mob the keys. The accused African-Americans were taken back to Moberly and in front of a crowd of about a thousand masked men, an attempt was made to hang all four on the same branch. Unable to handle the combined weight the branch broke. The failed hanging attempt allowed the accused to flee but armed men were able to shoot one down and the three remaining were able to escape in the chaos. County authorities quickly rearrested two and a third was arrested late Sunday, November 16, 1919.

She was the first black Brazilian woman to earn a doctorate in physics and has dedicated her career to improving the representation of black Brazilians in academia.  Early life and education  Guimarães was born in Brotas. Her father worked on tapestries and her mother was a merchant. At primary school and secondary school Guimarães was always the top of the class, but she experienced racism as a child. She worked part- time during school and used the money that she earned to pay for college. Whilst at high school Guimarães wanted to become an engineer, and sat the Mapofei entrance exam that was a requirement for entry to the University of São Paulo. In 1976 she became the first member of her family to attend university when she joined the Federal University of São Carlos. During her first year she encountered physics for the first time; and during her course on solid state physics decided that she loved the subject. She remained there for her master's degree, where she worked on ellipsometry. After completing her undergraduate degree Guimarães moved to Italy where she joined the University of Bologna and worked on microelectronics. In 1986 Guimarães moved to the United Kingdom. Guimarães joined the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology as a doctoral student, where she worked alongside Anthony Peaker. In 1989 she became the first black woman in Brazil to earn a doctorate in physics. Guimarães has said that she was not aware of this until her story was featured on the website Black Women of Brazil.  Research and career  Guimarães advocating for black women in 2018 with Silvana Bahia and Jurema Werneck of Amnesty International. Guimarães joined the Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica in São José dos Campos in 1993. She was the first black woman to do so, and joined at a time that women were not allowed to enter the ITA. Whilst women were allowed to enter the university toward the end of 1995, they are still underrepresented to this day – from 2013 to 2018 less than 10 % of the students who entered the Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica were women. Her research considers electron transport in epitaxially grown semiconductor alloys and the development of novel materials for sensing applications. In 2014 Guimarães delivered a TED talk \\"Educação é a única solução\\" (Education is the only solution). Alongside her academic research Guimarães has worked to improve diversity in Brazilian research. In particular, she has looked to support women and black people, who make up over half of the Brazilian population but are severely underrepresented in universities. She has given a series of academic lectures about her experiences of racism in academia and the impact of affirmative action programmes. She was awarded the Black Race Trophy in recognition of her advocacy work. In 2019 the Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica announced that it would join the quota system for black students. Whilst Guimarães had considered retiring, she wants to stay there for the first year of quota students.

This is a list of military parades held in Pyongyang, the capital of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) since 1948. All military parades consist of troops from the Korean People's Army and the paramilitary Worker-Peasant Red Guards. All military parades of a national nature are held on Pyongyang's Kim Il-sung Square with the Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea, Chairman of the State Affairs Commission and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of North Korea in attendance. These parades are broadcast live on Korean Central Television. Contrary to popular belief, military parades are for the most part, held on quintennial or decennial anniversaries (every 5 or 10 years) and/or jubilee years (ex: 25th anniversary, 40th anniversary, 50th anniversary, 60th anniversary, 70th anniversary).See \\"Puk chuyo’gi’nyŏm’il 5–10 nyŏnmada taegyumo yŏlpyŏngsik\\" (North Korea Holds Large Military Parades for Anniversaries Every 5–10 years), Chosŏn Ilbo, 25 April 2007; Chang Jun-ik, \\"Pukhan Inmingundaesa\\" (History of the North Korean Military), Seoul, Sŏmundang, 1991, pp. 19–88; Kim Kwang-su, \\"Chosŏninmingun’ŭi ch’angsŏlgwa palchŏn, 1945~1990\\" (Foundation and Development of the Korean People’s Army, 1945~1990), Chapter Two in Kyŏngnam University North Korean Studies Graduate School, Pukhan’gunsamunje’ŭi chaejomyŏng (The Military of North Korea: A New Look), Seoul, Hanul Academy, 2006, pp. 63–78. Many parade participants are awarded with special decorative medals as well as certain arrangements at their barracks. Military Foundation Day Parades held in honor of Military Foundation Day: =1948= The first parade of Korean People's Army took place on Military Foundation Day in 1948. It took place at Pyongyang Station in the presence of Soviet generals from the 25th Army and Soviet Civil Administration. It included the participation of about 20,000 North Korean soldiers who stood at attention during the first part of the parade in which Premier Kim Il Sung presided as commander in chief. =1972= It celebrated the KPA's ruby jubilee. Unlike the first parade, this parade included more diverse contingents of troops, particularly motorized infantry. According to a later defector from the Pyongyang Defense Command, a female officer collapsed after her appendix burst following the parade, to which she was \\"praised\\" by her superiors for having concealed it. =1992= In 1992, the KPA's diamond jubilee parade was held. It saw the participation of over 20,000 active troops and 1,200 pieces of weaponry, as well veterans of all wars in which the DPRK was a participant. During the parade, KPA Supreme Commander Kim Jong-il made his first public speech during a military parade for the KPA's 60th anniversary and said: \\"Glory to the officers and soldiers of the heroic Korean People's Army!\\", which was followed by a loud applause by the crowd on the square. It was the last parade to include the Soviet-style goose step. Newly promoted Marshal O Jin-u made the keynote address and the parade was commanded by also newly promoted Vice Marshal Kim Kwang-jin. =2007= The parade celebrated the 75th anniversary of the KPA. General Kim Kyok-sik, the then defence chief of the DPRK, gave the keynote address. The broadcast was delayed by three hours, with speculation by experts that this was due to Kim Jong Il's absence. =2013= The parade celebrated the 81st anniversary of the KPA. It was one of the only times a parade was held on a non-jubilee year; the parade that was planned for the previous year was cancelled due to the preparations for the parade on the 100th anniversary of Kim Il Sung that was held ten days prior to the planned parade.https://m-en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20130501007400325? It was the first to be held on the forecourt of the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun. Military hardware was not displayed during the parade. Speeches were delivered by commanders of the different branches of the KPA, during which they spoke of the military readiness of their branches. =2018= In 2018, the platinum jubilee anniversary of the founding of the KPA in its current form took place on 8 February that year. It was speculated that this parade, which was the first since the holiday was changed back to 8 February, was held deliberately to coincide with the 2018 Winter Olympics opening ceremony in Pyeongchang County, South Korea, during which North Korean and South Korean athletes marched together in the parade of nations. The parade included 13,000 soldiers of the KPA. Republic Day Parades in honor of the Day of the Foundation of the Republic: =1988= The parade celebrated the 40th anniversary of the republic. A Polish film named Defilada (The Parade) was published in 1989 by Andrzej Fidyk, who was sent by the government of the Polish People's Republic to create a documentary on the parade as well as the larger 40th anniversary celebrations. Chinese President Yang Shangkun as well as Bulgarian Premier Georgi Atanasov were in attendance. =1998= It celebrated the golden jubilee of the DPRK's establishment. The massed bands included a tri-service element which included military bands from all the branches. =2003= It celebrated the 55th anniversary of independence. It was the largest parade seen in the country in over a decade. Contrary to what was speculated, the hour and a half parade did not feature any new missiles. Only medium range missiles were displayed in the hardware section. The parade was the last appearance of Pak Song-chol, Premier of North Korea from 1976 to 1977. =2008= It celebrated the diamond jubilee of the foundation of the republic. It was noted for the absence of General Secretary Kim Jong-Il, which caused speculation on his state of health. Many intelligence agencies in the United States believed Kim might be \\"gravely ill\\" after suffering from a stroke, which caused his absence from the parade. Only the Worker-Peasant Red Guards took part, providing personnel and equipment for the marchpast and the mobile column. =2011= It celebrated the 63rd anniversary of independence. It marked one of the last appearances by Kim Jong Il and his successor Kim Jong Un together. The parade followed the former's return from a state visit to Russia. Just like in 2008, the Worker-Peasant Red Guards made up the majority of the parading units. = 2013 = The parade parked the 65th anniversary of the establishment of the republic. =2018= In 2018, North Korea marked the 70th anniversary of its foundation. The parade was inspected by Vice Marshal Ri Yong-gil and saw the introduction of new camouflage inspection vehicles.http://www.rodong.rep.kp/article_contents_en/2018/09/10/photo/2018-09-10-01-0012.jpg It also saw the rare refrain from displaying intercontinental ballistic missiles. Russian Federation Council Chairman Valentina Matviyenko and Mauritanian President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, as well as delegations from Cuba, Syria, Lebanon, the State of Palestine, Uganda, and South Africa were in attendance during the celebrations.General Secretary of the Communist Party of China Xi Jinping was expected to attend the parade during his state visit to North Korea on 9 September, but cancelled his attendance, instead sending Li Zhanshu, the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. American President Donald Trump displayed the parade as an accomplishment in the Korean peace process, noting the lack of ICBMs that were paraded. Workers Party Day Parades in honor of Party Foundation Day: =1995= Celebrated the 50th golden jubilee anniversary of the WPK. The parade was the first of its kind held in the country. It was the first parade presided by Kim Jong Il as leader of the country. Defence minister Choe Kwang delivered the keynote address at the ceremony. =2000= Celebrated the 55th anniversary of the WPK. =2005= It celebrated the 60th anniversary of the WPK. =2010= Celebrated the 65th anniversary of the WPK. It was the first time Kim Jong Il's successor Kim Jong Un had appeared at a military parade. This appearance came two weeks after Kim was made Kim Jong-un was made a daejang (four-star general) and was appointed Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea. This was seen as an sign of Kim's future as the next leader of the country. This was the first parade to allow full international press access, an unprecedented decision. Chief of the General Staff Ri Yong-ho gave the keynote speech. It displayed new surface-to-air missiles that resembled the S-300 and the HQ-9. The central chant of the parade was: \\"Kim Jong Il! Protect him to the death! Kim Jong Il, let's unite to support him!\\" It was the last time the Mercedes-Benz 600 was used in a military parade. =2015= The parade marked the 70th anniversary of the WPK. It was delayed for several hours due to thunderstorms that took place the night before. The parade did not feature any new weapons such as UAVs or ballistic missiles. Chinese First Secretary of the Secretariat of the Communist Party of China Liu Yunshan was in attendance. It also preceded the announcement of the 7th Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea. =2020= The 2020 parade marked the 75th anniversary of the foundation of the WPK.https://www.nknews.org/2020/06/north-korea-preparing-military-parade-for- october-says-seouls-defense-ministry/ The parade was held in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic, with many foreign observers noticing the lack of facemasks in the parade and in the audience stands. The Kim Jong Un National Defense University participated in the parade for the first time. The school dean was put in charge of the school's preparation for the parade and a former soldier with \\"relevant experience\\" served as flag bearer for the KJU University colour.https://www.dailynk.com/english/kim-jong-un-national-defense- university-students-participate-october-military-parade/ Renovations to the viewing platform om Kim Il Sung Square were made for the parade, with a new marble viewing platform replacing the previous one used for parades.https://www.nknews.org/pro/work-on-pyongyang-central-square-continues- ahead-of-military-parade-photos-show/ Also, it was the first to be held at midnight, and saw the return of the Soviet style goose-step as the official parade step of all KPA formations. Many officers were dressed in a new redesigned full dress uniform that beared similarities to the Russian military uniform that was introduced in 2017. The new uniforms were similar to those used in the Moscow Victory Parade of 1945. In addition new uniforms debuted which featured digital camouflage, replacing the classic combat uniforms that were used for many years.https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/36999/kim-jong- un-just-showed-the-world-the-war-machine-he-built-while-feinting-diplomacy The massed military bands performed an exhibition drill routine, shaping the numbers \\"10.10\\", \\"1945\\", and \\"2020\\" during the prelude to the parade.

This parade also introduced a new main battle tank that had not previously been seen. National Liberation Day/Victory Day Parades in honor of the National Liberation Day of Korea and the Day of Victory in the Great Fatherland Liberation War: =1949 and 1953-60= The 1949 Liberation day parade was the first parade held since the DPRK's establishment. Held at Pyongyang Station, it celebrated the 4th liberation anniversary. A parade was held again in 1953 after the end of the Korean War, and then conducted every year until 1960. The 1960 parade celebrated the 15th anniversary of liberation. It was the last parade to be held until 1985. =1985= The parade was part of country's 40th anniversary of liberation ceremonies.

Hernandez aims to apply the findings from the ungulates to humans having issues with breastfeeding.  Career  Hernandez grew up in El Paso, Texas. Initially she studied at Iowa State University, however she transferred to New Mexico State University where she completed her masters in animal science and toxicology. She started her PhD in 2005 at the University of Arizona with mammary gland physiologist Bob Collier. Hernandez joined the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 2011. Hernandez once embarked on a sabbatical for six months in order to become a clinical lactation consultant, and she also demonstrates at the annual Wisconsin 'Cow College' at University of Wisconsin–Extension designed to educate members of the dairy farm community about the science of cow lactation. In 2014 she was given the Alfred Toepfer Faculty Fellow Award by her department for her promising work as an assistant professor, and in 2017 the American Dairy Science Association (ASDA) awarded her an ASDA Foundation Scholar Award.  Research  Lactation can drain calcium from human and cow mothers. In dairy cows, if this loss is substantial enough, it can cause milk fever. Hernandez's lab showed that increasing levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin lead to changes in the amount of calcium in Jersey and Holstein cows. In Jersey cows the amount of calcium in the milk was increased, while the increase was found in the blood circulation of Holstein cattle, showing different regulation of calcium in the two breeds. Hernandez further demonstrated that SSRIs (which interfere with serotonin uptake by cells) can exacerbate the loss of bone calcium that women experience when breast-feeding their child. Since 12% of lactating women are on SSRIs this could be causing numerous cases of osteoporosis. Hernandez's lab also studies the lactation of rodents as a model for larger mammals. They published a study in 2019 demonstrating that SSRIs detrimentally impact bone density of newborns as well as the mother due to the inhibition of serotonin, and hence calcium, uptake.

He was a founding professor of Huazhong University of Science and Technology and served as Honorary Dean of the School of Economics. In 1992 the university established the Zhang Peigang Development Economics Prize in his honour. Biography Zhang was born on 10 July 1913 in Hong'an County, Hubei, Republic of China. After graduating from the Department of Economics of Wuhan University in 1934, he worked for the Institute of Social Studies of Academia Sinica, performing agricultural surveys in Hebei, Zhejiang, and Guangxi. Zhang passed Chinese government scholarship exams for study abroad in 1940, and went to the United States to study at Harvard University the following year. He passed his master's exams in 1943 and earned his Ph.D. in economics in December 1945. He returned to China in 1946 and served as professor and chair of the Department of Economics of Wuhan University. The renowned economist was one of his students. In 1948, Zhang was appointed counselor (the fourth-ranked official) in the Bangkok-based Asia and Far East Economic Committee of the United Nations. However, he decided to resign and return to China on the eve of the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. In 1952, Zhang was appointed a member of the planning committee for the founding of Huazhong Institute of Technology (now Huazhong University of Science and Technology, HUST), and became a professor of economics when the university opened in 1953. During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), Zhang was denounced as a \\"reactionary academic authority\\" and forced to perform hard labour. His large collection of foreign books and documents was destroyed. After the end of the Cultural Revolution, he was rehabilitated and later served as Honorary Dean of the School of Economics and Director of the Research Center of Economic Development at HUST. Zhang died at Wuhan Union Hospital on 23 November 2011, aged 98. He had been scheduled to receive the Lifetime Achievement Award of HUST on the day he died.  Contributions  Zhang's 70 years of academic career was closely connected with the emergence and evolution of development economics. His doctoral dissertation, entitled Agriculture and Industrialization: The Adjustment That Takes Place as an Agricultural Country Is Industrialized, was awarded the David A. Wells Prize for 1946–1947 by Harvard University. It was published in 1949 in the journal Harvard Economic Studies (Volume 85). In 1951, it was translated into Spanish and published in Mexico. The Spanish translation was adopted as a textbook by several Latin American universities in the 1950s; it was first published in Chinese in 1984. Zhang's dissertation was one of the foundational works of early stage development economics. It put forward the theories of the industrialization of agricultural countries systematically, and focused on three main factors of the dynamic relationship between agriculture and industry: food, raw materials, and labor, with detailed arguments. As such, Zhang is considered a pioneer in development economics and a founder of the discipline in China. In 1992, Huazhong University of Science and Technology established the Zhang Peigang Development Economics Prize to reward economists who have made outstanding contributions to the field.

Batting twice in the match, Bell was dismissed without scoring in the Gentlemen of the North first-innings by W. Little, while in their second-innings he was not out batting at number eleven, having scored a single run. After graduating from Durham, he returned to Marlborough to take up the post of assistant master, which he held between 1862-72. By 1878, he was the personal chaplain to Lord Muncaster while also concurrently serving as vicar of Muncaster. He was appointed to the position of honorary canon of Carlisle Cathedral in 1888, while the following year he was appointed as proctor for the Archdeacon of Furness, Arthur Crosse. Bell died in France at Saint-Jean-de-Luz in June 1919. His son, Aubrey FitzGerald Bell, was a Portuguese and Spanish scholar.

Visible from the Whistler Blackcomb ski area, it is situated south of Whistler, and its nearest higher peak is Castle Towers Mountain, to the west. The Cheakamus Glacier lies between these two summits, and precipitation runoff from the peak and meltwater from the glacier drains into tributaries of the Cheakamus River. The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1929 by Neal M. Carter and Emmy Milledge. The mountain is named after Professor John Davidson (1878 – 1970), who contributed a large amount of botanical knowledge about Garibaldi Park. The mountain's name was officially adopted on September 2, 1930, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Climate Mount Davidson in spring Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Davidson is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Mount Davidson.

He graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, College of Commerce where he graduated with a business degree in 1932. After graduating he was hired as an accountant by a predecessor to Deloitte. In the 1930s, Mr. Long borrowed $25,000 ($376,000 in 2018) to open a drug store with his younger brother, Joseph in Oakland. That store would become the first of a 274-store chain which in 1996 had annual sales of $2.5 billion in five states as of the time of his death. The New York Times quotes retail experts as saying part of the Longs' success was \\"an ability to have each store cater to the needs of its community.\\" Thomas Long retired as the company's chairman in 1975, but he remained a director until his death. He tried to avoid publicity and shunned extravagance, though he was reported to hold more than $70 million of the company's stock. Mr. Long died at his home, company officials said Monday. The cause of death was not announced. At the time of his death Long was survived by two daughters, two sons, one brother, two sisters, and six grandchildren. He was the chief donor to the Thomas J.

Boa constrictor occidentalis is a member of the family Boidae, found in the subtropical temperate west of Argentina and Paraguay, although some members have been reported to exist in Bolivia as well.  Description  = Size and weight = The Boa constrictor occidentalis subspecies experiences sexual dimorphism, with females being greater in size and weight. Adult males average a length of 180 cm (5.9 ft) whereas adult females average a length of 205 cm (6.73 ft), though some members have been found to reach as long as 4 m (13.13 ft). Male members of this subspecies on average weigh 4.06 kg (8.95 lb). Female members are much heavier, weighing at an average of 6.13 kg (13.5 lb). Male Argentine boas generally have longer tails in order to contain the hemipenes as well as having longer pelvic spurs that the male uses to grip onto the female and stimulate during copulation. = Coloring = Boa constrictor occidentalis possess a wide range of scale coloration ranging from black specimens with a high rate of contrasting white to specimens exhibiting varying degrees of burnt-orange to red. This species usually possesses a grey belly and a dark line running from the neck to the tip of its snout, as well as from the eyes to the neck. Young members of this species commonly exhibit a pink hue that darkens as they reach sexual maturity. = Scalation = Boa constrictor occidentalis possesses 242-251 ventral scales, 64-87 dorsal scales, 21-22 supralabial scales, and 45 subcaudal scales.  Distribution and habitat  Boa constrictor occidentalis is an exclusively New World subspecies and is found in Argentina, between the Andes Mountains and the Parana River, Paraguay, and reportedly in Bolivia. It is endemic in the Gran Chaco region. It has the largest distribution of all neotropical boas. Boa constrictor occidentalis can be found in 13 of the 23 provinces of Argentina and has been estimated to have a historical extent of occurrence that covers approximately 15% of the country's mainland territory, which is about 42.3 million ha. Its southernmost limit of distribution in South America rests at 33° 20' S latitude, in the province of San Luis, Argentina. Boa constrictor occidentalis prefers wetlands such as rain forests due to the high humidity and moderate temperatures. Boa constrictor occidentalis prefers temperatures of 80-85 degrees Fahrenheit with nighttime temperatures of 78 degrees, though they are capable of tolerating temperatures down to 65-70 degrees Fahrenheit. This subspecies commonly associates with Viscacha (Lagostomus maximus) burrows, preying on the rodents and using their burrows as refuge. Though mostly terrestrial, this subspecies sometimes live in and near trees that they climb for hunting and perching. During the day, it will shelter itself within tree hollows, old logs, and, as previously mentioned, animal burrows. Boas can persist in environments that have been degraded so long as woody plants and scattered trees are present to meet the subspecies' needs. The habitat that Boa constrictor occidentalis resides in reaches an altitude of 900–1,000 m above sea level, with rainfall of 250–900 mm. Though very rare, it has been reportedly found at elevations above 1,000 m or in areas with rainfall in excess of 900 mm.  Behavior  Boa constrictor occidentalis are nocturnal and are usually independent, not interacting with other members of its subspecies except during mating seasons. They are known to be a very docile but can become very aggressive when it becomes frightened or nervous, and are known to hiss during these situations. Boa constrictor occidentalis enjoy soaking in water and as such live in wetlands and near bodies of water such as streams, ponds, rivers, etc. = Hunting and diet = Boa constrictor occidentalis is an opportunistic hunter, feeding on small animals, birds, and rodents. This subspecies is very active at night, climbing on trees to ambush prey. As per its species, the Boa constrictor occidentalis kills prey by constriction. It ambushes prey, grasping the prey using its mouth and large teeth, proceeding to wrap its coils around the body of the prey, exerting high amounts of external pressure that stop blood flow to the brain, quickly killing the prey. = Reproduction and Development = Boa constrictor occidentalis reproduction is strongly seasonal within both sexes. Females are reproductive between April to August during the dry season. During this dry season 50% of adult females and 64% of adult male are reproductive. Boa constrictor occidentalis undergo mating aggregations during the dry seasons for reproduction usually consisting of one adult female and one to three adult males. Clutches range between ten to forty live young and average around 25 live young. Boa constrictor occidentalis is ovoviviparous. Gestation periods last between 5–8 months and is dependent on the environmental temperature. They are born fully independent and experience little change in coloration as they develop, with the only major change being a fading of color. Young boas tend to be arboreal in nature, but as they grow larger and heavier, they become more terrestrial. Boa constrictor occidentalis reach sexual maturity around 2–3 years. Young Boa constrictor occidentalis will shed their skin up to 9 times a year if intensely fed. As the subspecies reaches sexual maturity, this shedding process slows down to four to five sheds per year.  Captivity  Boa constrictor occidentalis is a common subspecies found in the pet trade. Due to their status as a threatened subspecies on the CITES Appendix I, heavy restrictions have been implemented on the exporting of Argentine boas. While in captivity, life expectancy of an Argentine boa ranges between 20–30 years, some have been known to live longer - up to 40 years. When in captivity, Argentine boas are fed mice, rats, rabbits, and even small birds.  Conservation  Boa constrictor occidentalis is considered a threatened subspecies. Boa constrictor occidentalis is incapable of occupying grass or crop dominated landscapes without there being a more complex spatial matrix that includes patches of woody vegetation. The species is subject to strong hunting and capture pressures for both its skin and for the pet trade. Intense farming and cattle raising has severely modified its habitat. Because of these environmental pressures over the past 90 years, its original range has been severely reduced to only a fraction of what it was originally. Boa constrictor occidentalis is the only Boa constrictor subspecies listen on the CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) Appendix I. CITES names animals considered threatened with extinction.

Written by Alan Fennell and directed by Alan Pattillo, it was first broadcast on 28 February 1965 on ATV London. The series follows the exploits of the World Aquanaut Security Patrol (WASP), an organisation responsible for policing the Earth's oceans in the 2060s. Its flagship, Stingray, is a combat submarine crewed by Captain Troy Tempest, Lieutenant George Lee \\"Phones\\" Sheridan and Marina, a mute young woman from under the sea. Stingrays adventures bring it into contact with numerous underwater civilisations, some friendly and others hostile, as well as strange natural phenomena. In \\"Tom Thumb Tempest\\", Troy has a nightmare in which Stingray and its crew are miniaturised. The use of life-sized sets to convey the shrinking of the puppet characters has attracted a mixed response from commentators. Plot The Stingray crew are relaxing in the Marineville standby lounge when Commander Shore (voiced by Ray Barrett) orders them to prepare to launch, warning them of a dangerous mission. Captain Troy Tempest (voiced by Don Mason) is eager to leave immediately but Shore tells him to await further instructions. Troy's attention turns to the fish in the lounge aquarium. He then falls asleep in his chair. Troy wakes to hear Shore on the intercom, ordering the crew to launch. He leaves in Stingray with Phones (voiced by Robert Easton) and Marina. Shore radios in, ordering Troy to pilot Stingray through an undersea tunnel. Troy asks for details of the mission but Shore gruffly denies his request, leaving Troy feeling belittled. Stingray exits the tunnel and hits a sheet of glass. The crew are astonished to find that they have been miniaturised and ended up inside an aquarium within a giant dining room. Leaving Stingray on their hovering monocopters, they investigate the dining table, which has been set for various undersea villains. At the head of the table, set for King Titan of Titanica, is a schematic of Marineville's defence systems. The crew realise that they have stumbled across a gathering of the undersea races to plot the destruction of Marineville. The crew hide as an Aquaphibian dressed as a waiter enters the room to check the table. They then use a nearby telephone to call Marineville. Shore answers and Troy explains the situation, but the commander thinks that Troy is joking and ends the call. The crew again take cover as the Aquaphibian returns with Titan's agent X-2-Zero (voiced by Robert Easton), who notices the mess the crew have made of the table and reprimands the Aquaphibian for what he assumes to be poor table-setting. The Aquaphibian tidies up. Left alone, the crew destroy the schematic by pouring alcohol on it and setting it alight. The fire quickly engulfs the room, forcing them back to Stingray. As the aquarium boils, Troy realises that Stingray is trapped. He orders Phones to break the glass with a torpedo, hoping that the escaping water will put out the fire. As the torpedo is fired, Troy wakes to find himself back in the lounge. Shore tells the crew to stand down and Troy, realising that he has had a nightmare, apologises to the commander for his impatience. Production \\"Tom Thumb Tempest\\" was significant for combining -scale Supermarionation puppets with a life-sized dining room set. It was not the first episode of a Supermarionation series to deal with miniaturised characters: the idea had previously been explored in Supercars \\"Calling Charlie Queen\\" and Fireball XL5s \\"The Triads\\". However, whereas those episodes had used back projection for their miniaturisation effects, \\"Tom Thumb Tempest\\" presented its \\"shrunken\\" characters on a physical set. Stephen La Rivière cites \\"Tom Thumb Tempest\\" as another example of the \\"Land of Giants-type\\" episode that APF had attempted in its previous two series.La Rivière, p. 103. Reception Gerry Anderson biographers Simon Archer and Marcus Hearn consider \\"Tom Thumb Tempest\\" to be one of Stingrays most entertaining episodes. TV Zone names it the worst of the series, calling the ending \\"reasonably clever\\" but the episode overall a \\"wasted opportunity\\". The magazine argues that the episode is spoiled through its use of \\"two hoary old clichés – the 'incredible shrinking cast' idea ... and the 'it was all a dream' cop-out ending\\" – the first of which merely emphasises the \\"unreality\\" of the plot while the second renders the episode \\"entirely inconsequential\\". The magazine also criticises the dream sequence itself for being insufficiently surreal and \\"[degenerating] into sub-Tom and Jerry shenanigans\\" towards the end. Jim Sangster and Paul Condon, authors of Collins Telly Guide, describe the episode as \\"decidedly less aimed at realism\\" than those of later Supermarionation series. They also refer to dream sequences as \\"one of Anderson's most annoying recurring plot devices\\". La Rivière suggests that the \\"tantalising glimpse of reality\\" provided by the episode conflicted with APF's ongoing efforts to make its puppet characters seem more human.La Rivière, p. 98. Ian Fryer regards the episode as a precursor of the final Supermarionation series, The Secret Service, which featured both puppets and live actors.

During this time he met his wife Mary Elizabeth Carney, daughter of owner of the Sydenham paper. At the age of 22 he purchased the Owen Sound Times in 1855, selling it four years later. For two years he went back and forth between Windsor and Detroit working as a printer, until he acquired the Essex Record in 1861. Laurie published the paper until 1869, when he left for Manitoba. Working for various provincial papers such as the Liberal and Manitoba Free Press over many years, he next set off for Battleford, Saskatchewan in June of 1878. A 650-mile journey made with an ox-cart carrying a printing press, Laurie would launch the Saskatchewan Herald on arrival, serving as editor and proprietor for the next 25 years until his death on May 11, 1903. Laurie would sell the Record to Alexander Cameron in 1869, only to have the offices destroyed by a fire a year later. It was then re-established by Stephen Lusted, who was born in England in 1834, and arrived in Ontario in 1842. His printing career began at 11 as an apprentice to John F. Rodgers, publisher of Woodstock’s The Monarch. After three years he departed, and spent another three with the British American, and at positions throughout Brantford, St. Thomas, Chatham and Ann Arbor, Michigan. After another several years as foreman of the Woodstock Times, Lusted came to Windsor in 1865. A daily edition of the paper was attempted in 1877, but would only last two months. Lusted was with the Record until 1882, having been appointed Town Clerk of Windsor in 1880. In 1882, the paper was being published from Sandwich Street's Opera Block. Lusted ended his tenure with the Record on November 9th, 1882, passing control to James and John Barr, their father Robert Sr. having purchased the paper. Brothers James, John, and William were at the Record, the former two having spent time with the Detroit Free Press and brother Robert, a columnist and editor there. The paper was operated by the Barr family, who sold it to Wallace Graham in 1890, and soon after the paper was transferred to Archibald McNee. McNee, later with John A. McKay, would establish a weekly and daily papers, renaming the Essex the Windsor Record.

The Mother Earth is portrayed as the vast and dark house of mortals. She is often paired with Dyēus, the daylight sky and seat of the gods, in a relationship of union and contrast. Dʰéǵʰōm is associated with fertility and growth, but also with death as the final dwelling of the deceased.  Name  = Etymology = The root for the word \\"earth\\", *dʰéǵʰōm, is one of the most attested in Indo-European languages. On the other hand, the linguistic evidence for the ritualization of the name *dʰéǵʰōm is not systematically spread across traditions, as she also appears under other names and epithets, principally *Pleth₂-wih₁ (the \\"Broad One\\"). If the goddess-earth is reliably reconstructed under the name *dʰéǵʰōm, she was the Earth herself conceived as a divine entity, rather than a goddess of the earth. = Epithets =  The \\"Broad One\\"  The commonest epithet applied to the earth in Indo-European poetic traditions is *Pléth₂wih₁ (the \\"Broad One\\" ; from *pléth₂us, \\"flat, vast, broad\\"). A group of cognates appear in Prithvi, the Vedic earth-goddess, in the Greek nymph Plataia, and most likely in the Gaulish goddess Litavis. The epiteth is also attested in comparable poetic expressions associating the two roots *dʰéǵʰōm and *pléth₂wih₁: Avestan ząm pərəϑβīm (\\"broad earth\\"), Sanskrit kṣā́m ... pṛthivī́m (\\"broad earth\\") and Old Hittite palḫiš ... dagan(-zipaš) (\\"broad ... earth[-genius]\\"). Another similar epithet is the \\"All-Bearing One\\", the one who bears all things or creatures. She was also referred to as \\"much- nourishing\\" or \\"rich-pastured\\" in Vedic, Greek, and Old Norse ritual expressions that shared the root *plh₁u- (\\"much\\").  Mother Earth  The Earth-goddess was widely celebrated with the title of \\"mother\\", and often paired with Dyēus, the Proto-Indo-European god of the daylight sky. She is called annas Daganzipas (\\"Mother Earth-spirit\\") in Hittite liturgy, and paired with the Storm-god of heaven, as well as Mat' Syra Zemlya (\\"Mother Moist Earth\\") in the Russian epic poems. To the goddess of the earth Prithvi is often attached the epithet Mata (\\"mother\\") in the Rigveda, especially when she is mentioned together with Dyaus, the sky-father. The goddess of the harvest and agriculture Demeter could also be a cognate, deriving from the Illyrian root Dā- (possibly from ) attached to māter (\\"mother\\"). The Roman evidence for the idea of Earth as a mother is doubtful, as it is usually associated with the name Terra, not Tellus, and it may be due to Greek influence. The Anglo- Saxon goddess Erce (possibly \\"bright, pure\\") is titled the \\"mother of Earth\\" (and likely identified with Mother Earth herself) in a ritual to be performed on plough-land that is unfruitful. She is also called Fīra Mōdor (\\"Mother of men\\") in Old English poetry. The Baltic goddess Zemyna is also associated with the epithets \\"Mother of the Fields\\" and \\"Mother of the Forests\\".Dixon-Kennedy, Mike. Encyclopedia of Russian and Slavic myth and legend. ABC-CLIO. 1998. p. 320. . A similar epithet is ascribed to Gaia, as Μητηρ Παντων (Mother of All), recorded, for instance, in Aeschylus' Prometheus Unbound (παμμῆτόρ τε γῆ; \\"Oh! universal mother Earth\\"),Aeschylus (1926). Herbert W. Smyth (transl.) Prometheus Bound. 88. Harvard University Press. and in The Libation Bearers (ἰὼ γαῖα μαῖα; Mother Gaia).Aeschylus (1926). Herbert W. Smyth (transl.) The Libation Bearers. 45. Harvard University Press. In a Samaveda hymn dedicated to the Vedic fire god Agni, he is described as \\"rapidly ... [moving] along his mother earth\\".Samaveda. Chapter I, Decade, V In an Atharveda Hymn (12.1) (Pṛthvī Sūkta, or Bhūmī Sūkta), the celebrant invokes Prithvi as his Mother, because he is \\"a son of Earth\\". The word bhūmi is also used as an epithet of Prithvi meaning \\"soil\\" and in reference to a threefold division of the universe in heavens, sky and earth.Soiver, Deborah A., State University of New York Press (Nov 1991), p. 51, The Myths of Narasimha and Vamana: Two Avatars in Cosmological PerspectiveA Dictionary of Hinduism: Its Mythology, Folklore and Development, 1500 B.C.– A.D. 1500. By Margaret and James Stutley. Routledge and Kegan Paul: London, 1977. pp. 46 and 84-85. On her own, Bhūmi is another Vedic deity with Mother-Earth attributes.  Dark Earth  A Proto-Indo-European epithet, reconstructed as *dʰéǵʰōm dʰṇgu-/dʰengwo- (\\"dark earth\\"), is also attested in several traditions. The formula dankuiš daganzipaš (\\"dark genius of the earth\\") is frequent in Hittite literature; it was used especially to name the underworld, but sometimes also the earth's surface. Other reflexes are found in Greek γαîα μέλαινα / Gaia Melaina (\\"black earth\\"), in Albanian dhe të zi (\\"black earth\\"), in Slavonic *črnā(yā) zemyā (\\"dark earth\\") or in Old Irish domun donn (\\"brown earth\\"). A Lithuanian expression takes the form \\"may the black earth not support me\\". In a Russian fairy tale, the maiden is buried \\"under a blanket of black earth\\".Ransome, Arthur. Old Peter's Russian Tales. London and Edinburgh: T. C. & E. C. Jack, Ltd., 1916. pp. 32-36. The formula of the dark earth seems to be related to invocation or oaths, where the announcer summons the Earth as an observer or witness, as seen by Solon's elegiac Fragment 36. The Slavic deity \\"Moist Earth\\" (Syra Zemlya) is also invoked during oaths and called to witness in land disputes.  Role  = Mating of Earth Mother and Sky Father = In the Indo-European cosmology, the earth Dʰéǵʰōm was perceived as a vast, flat and circular continent surrounded by waters (\\"The Ocean\\"), and the Earth goddess as the dark dwelling of mortals, in contrast with Dyēus, the bright diurnal sky and the seat of the gods. The Earth and Heaven couple is however not at the origin of the other gods, as the Divine Twins and Hausos were probably conceived by Dyēus alone. According to Jackson however, Dʰéǵʰōm is \\"a more fitting partner of Perkwunos than of Dyēus\\", since the former is associated with the fructifying rains as a weather god. Both deities often appear as a pair, the Sky Father (*Dyḗws Ph₂tḗr) uniting with Mother Earth (*Dʰéǵʰōm Méh₂tēr) to bring fertility. In the Vedic texts, Prithvi the mother is usually paired with Dyaus the father,\\"O Heaven (our) father, Earth (our) guileless mother\\", the Rigveda, 6.51.5, trans. West (2007). as shown for instance in Samaveda hymns.Samaveda. Book IV, Chapter I, Decade IV.Samaveda. Book VII, Chapter III, Hymn XIV. In an Atharveda Hymn (12.1), Prithvi is coupled with Parjanya (Sanskrit: पर्जन्य, parjánya), a deity of rain and fertilizer of earth. According to Herodotus, the Scythians considered Earth to be the wife of Zeus. In Hittite mythology, the Storm God of Heaven, one of the most important in the Hittite pantheon,Singer, Itamar. Hittite Prayers. Leiden: Brill. 2002. p. 82. has been syncretized with local Anatolian or Hattian deities, merging with a local storm god with terrestrial characteristics. At a later point, the Storm God of Heaven was paired with local goddess Wurulemu, with chthonic traits.Green, Alberto Ravinell Whitney. The Storm-god in the Ancient Near East. Published for Biblical and Judaic Studies - The University of California, San Diego. Winona Lake, Indiana: Eisenbraus. 2003. pp. 144-152. Zeus is associated with Semele, a possible descendant of Dʰéǵʰōm, but also with Demeter, which could be another cognate stemming from the Mother Earth. In the Danaids, Aeschylus describes how Ouranos and Chthôn are seized by a mutual desire for sexual intercourse: the rain falls, then Earth conceives and brings forth pasture, cereal crops, and foliage. Likewise, \\"Heaven and Earth\\" regularly appear as a duo among deities invoked as witnesses to Hittite treaties, and the Roman Tellus Mater is paired with Jupiter in Macrobius's Saturnalia. The mating of Zeus and female characters with chthonic elements (Démeter) or associated with earth (such as Semele, Plataia and Themis) may be a remnant of the Sky/Earth coupling. Other religious expressions and formulas in Greek cultic practice attest to a wedding or union between a sky-god and an earth-mother: the Homeric Hymn to Gaia calls her \\"Wife of Starry Ouranos\\";Palaima, Thomas G. Anthology of Classical Myth: Primary Sources in Translation. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, Inc. 2004. p. 209. weddings in Athens were dedicated to both Ouranos and Gaia;Benko, Stephen. The Virgin Goddess: Studies in the Pagan and Christian Roots of Mariology. Leiden: Brill. p. 90. an Orphic hymn tells that the cultist is both \\"a child of Earth and starry Sky\\";Numerous tablets contain this essential formula with minor variations; for the Greek texts and translations, see Fritz Graf and Sarah Iles Johnston, Ritual Texts for the Afterlife: Orpheus and the Bacchic Gold Tablets (Routledge, 2007), pp. 4–5 (Hipponion, 400 BC), 6–7 (Petelia, 4th century BC), pp. 16–17 (Entella, possibly 3rd century BC), pp. 20–25 (five tablets from Eleutherna, Crete, 2nd or 1st century BC), pp. 26–27 (Mylopotamos, 2nd century BC), pp. 28–29 (Rethymnon, 2nd or 1st century BC), pp. 34–35 (Pharsalos, Thessaly, 350–300 BC), and pp. 40–41 (Thessaly, mid-4th century BC) in Athens, there was a statue of Gaia on the Acropolis depicting her beseeching Zeus for rain.Pausanias. Description of Greece, 1.24.3 ff. In Norse Mythology, the goddess Jörd, a jötunn (giantess) whose name means \\"earth\\" (from Proto-Germanic *erþō-, 'earth, soil, land'), begets the thunder- god Thor (Donar) with Odinn–not a sky-god, although a chief god of the Norse pantheon.Fee, Christopher R. Gods, Heroes, & Kings: The Battle for Mythic Britain. Oxford University Press. 2001. pp. 77-78. A line in the Gylfaginning by Norse poet Snorri Sturluson mentions that the Earth is both daughter and wife (\\"Jörðin var dóttir hans ok kona hans\\") of the All-Father,The Viking Age: A Reader. Second Edition. Edited by Angus A. Somerville and R. Andrew McDonald. University of Toronto Press. 2014. p. 45. identified as Odinn. = Final dwelling of mortals = The word for \\"earth\\" underlies the many formations for designating humans as mortals, either because they are \\"earthly\\" or because they were fashioned from the earth itself. It is attested in descendent cognates of the derivative form *dʰǵʰ-men, as in Sanskrit jmán (\\"from the earth\\"), Latin homō (\\"man\\"), Germanic *guman- (\\"man\\"), Lithuanian žmuõ (\\"man\\") and Old Prussian smoy (\\"man\\"), and perhaps in the Gaulish Xtonion (?)Lejeune, Michel. “Une bilingue gauloise-latine à Verceil”.

This suggests a hierarchical conception of the status of mankind regarding the gods, confirmed by the widespread use of the term \\"mortal\\" as a synonym of \\"human\\" rather than \\"living species\\" in Indo-European traditions. In a Hittite military oath, the earth is said to drink the blood of the fallen (\\"This not wine, it is your blood, and as the earth has swallowed this...\\"), as in Aeschylus' Seven Against Thebes (736) and in the Indian Mahabharata (\\"... the earth shall drink today the blood of their king\\"). Another reflex of Dʰéǵʰōm as the mother of mortals and their final resting place may also be found in Demetrioi (\\"of Demeter\\"), an Athenian designation for the dead,Harrison, Jane Ellen. Myths of Greece and Rome. 1928. pp. 63-64 and in Aeschylus's verses in Choephori 127: \\"Yea, summon Earth, who brings all things to life, / And rears and takes again into her womb.\\"Jones, Prudence; Pennick, Nigel (1995). A History of Pagan Europe. Routledge. p. 17. .Harrison, Jane Ellen. Myths of Greece and Rome. 1928. pp. 63-64 Dʰéǵʰōm had a connection with both death and life, as the deceased shall return to her and the crop grows from her moist soil, fertilized by the rain of Dyēus.

It is based on the Illuminati card game by Steve Jackson Games. It was originally owned by Adventure Systems but transitioned to Flying Buffalo Inc in 1986. The game's central focus is on conspiracy and intrigue and today involves 24 players playing either by email or by mail in turns processed simultaneously by computer. Illuminati has won the Origins Award for Best Play-By-Mail Game seven times, once in 1985 and six times in the 1990s, and was inducted into the Origins Hall of Fame in 1997. Gameplay Illuminati's central focus is conspiracy and intrigue. 24 players act as a secret organizations with the purpose of world domination. The game has four phases. The first phase is the \\"grab\\" phase where players attempt to control game resources. Players will begin dropping from the game in this phase. The second phase is the consolidation phase where tensions escalate and diplomacy plays a greater role. The third warfare phase is followed by the fourth endgame phase. Development Draper Kauffman stated that \\"The strange thing about this game is that it didn't start out as Illuminati\\", but rather that he \\"began with the basic concept of a PBM game of world conflict carried out by spies and secret agents, saboteurs and assassins, propagandists and opinion makers, hot money and smuggled arms, popular movements and secret conspiracies.\\" Illuminati was originally owned by Adventure Systems and transitioned to Flying Buffalo Inc in 1986. Flying Buffalo initially ran the game so that turns were processed upon receipt, whereas play-by-mail games were normally processed on a specified date, simultaneously. This gave an advantage to play-by-email (PBEM) over play-by-mail (PBM) players, and after a break in game licensing, Flying Buffalo separated the player types into different games and processed turns simultaneously. Reception and legacy Robert S. Cushman reviewed Illuminati PBM in Space Gamer No. 72, and stated that \\"For you card players, prepare to have your conspiracies expanded several-fold, and for you PBMers, get ready to enjoy a really novel game, with lots of amusing quirks.\\" Illuminati has won the Origins Award a number of times: in 1985, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1995. The game was added to the Origins Hall of Fame in 1997. In the early 1990s, Illuminati placed between 55 and 65 percent in the Paper Mayhem play- by-mail game ratings in which readers ranked games based on playability, design, and product understanding.

It was first described to science by George Brettingham Sowerby I in 1833. No English common name has been recorded for this species. The first appearance of this animal in the fossil record is 5.333 million years ago.  Description  The shell is roughly trapezoidal with 15 raised ribs. In some individuals, small spines or scales are found on the posterior ends (furthest from the hinge) of the larger ribs. The shell is colored in brown shades both on its exterior and interior. Shells have been recorded between 50.7mm and 101.2mm (2 to 4 inches) long.  Distribution  Carditamera affinis is found in the eastern Pacific Ocean from California to Peru. It is also found in the Gulf of California and was one of the specimens collected there by John Steinbeck and Ed Ricketts, as recounted in The Log From The Sea Of Cortez. In 2012 a very similar looking species, Carditamera bajaensis, was split from C. affinis. Both species occur in the Gulf of California, but in different habitats. While C. affinis is epifaunal, that is it lives at the surface of the seabed on rocks and in crevices, C. bajaensis is infuanal or semi-infaunal, living completely or partly buried in sand, mud, or loose rocks. C. affinis is also found in the Galapagos Islands. This is a shallow-water species, living from the intertidal zone down to 27 meters (90 feet) deep.  Life history  Carditamera affinis is a filter feeder, straining nutrients from sea water that it pumps through its body. It is sessile as an adult, attaching itself to rocks and within crevices using a byssus. These animals can live as long as 17.25 years.

According to Ibn al-Athīr, he was not actually mute but had only a speech impediment and a stammer. He was the son of the Sultan Riḍwān by a daughter of Yağısıyan, governor of Antioch. Alp Arslān was only sixteen years old when he succeeded his father as sultan of Aleppo on 10 December 1113. As a result, according to Ibn al-Athīr, he \\"had only the semblance of authority as sultan, while\\" his atabeg Luʾluʾ al-Yaya \\"had the reality\\". After coming to power, he ordered the death of his full brother Malikshāh and his paternal half-brother Mubārakshah in imitation of his father, who had also ordered the death of his brothers upon coming to power. While Luʾluʾ had control over the army, the aḥdāth (local militia) remained loyal to Alp Arslān and under his control. At the suggestion of Sāʿid ibn Badīʿ, raʾīs (leader) of the aḥdāth, Alp Arslān persecuted the Nizārī Bāṭiniyya, executing their leader, Abū Ṭāhir al-Sāʾigh, and confiscating the properties of the rest. In this way he drove many Nizārīs over to the Christian Principality of Antioch. He later turned on Ibn Badīʿ, confiscating his property and exiling him to the ʿUqaylid emirate of Qalʿat Jaʿbar. He replaced him as raʾīs of the aḥdāth by a foreigner, Ibrāhīm al- Furātī. Because of his military weakness, Alp Arslān was forced to pay tribute to Antioch. In March 1114, Alp Arslān turned to Ṭughtegin of Damascus for protection against Antioch, against the Nizārīs and against his atabeg, Luʾluʾ. Ṭughtegin sent forces to Aleppo, but they found the official toleration of the Shia unacceptable and left before the end of the year. Roger of Salerno, regent of Antioch, forced the resumption of tribute. With Ṭughtegin's forces gone, the atabeg, in league with Shams al-Khawāṣṣ Yārūqtāsh, the lord of Rafanīya, whom Ṭughtegin had deposed, had the mamlūks murder Alp Arslān in the citadel. Luʾluʾ then placed Alp Arslān's six-year-old brother, Sulṭān Shāh, on the throne.

His mathematical discoveries include the first proof of the existence of the orthocentre of a triangle, a formula for the distance between the incentre and circumcentre of a triangle, and the discovery of Poncelet's porism on triangles with a common incircle and circumcircle. He was also one of the earliest mathematicians to calculate the values of annuities. Life Chapple was born in Witheridge on , the son of a poor farmer and parish clerk. He was a devoted bibliophile, and gained much of his knowledge of mathematics from Ward's The Young Mathematician's Guide: Being a Plain and Easie Introduction to the Mathematicks, in Five Parts. He became an assistant to the parish priest, and a regular contributor to The Ladies' Diary, especially concerning mathematical problems. He also later contributed work on West Country English to The Gentleman's Magazine. His correspondence led him to become, in 1738, the clerk for a surveyor in Exeter. He married the surveyor's niece, supervised the construction of a new hospital in Exeter, and became secretary of the hospital. He also worked as the estate steward for William Courtenay, 1st Viscount Courtenay. In 1772 he began work on an update to Tristram Risdon's Survey of the County of Devon, and spent much of the rest of his life working on it; it was published in part throughout his life, and in complete form posthumously in 1785. He died in early September 1781. A tablet in his memory could be found in the west end of the nave of the Church of St Mary Major, Exeter, prior to that church's demolition in 1971. Chapple Road in Witheridge is named after him. Contributions to mathematics Andrea del Centina writes that \\"To illustrate the work of Chapple, whose arguments are often confused and whose logic is very poor, even for the standard of his time, is not easy especially when trying to keep as faithful as possible to his thought.\\" Nevertheless, Chapple made several significant discoveries in mathematics. The triangular case of Poncelet's closure theorem Euler's theorem in geometry gives a formula for the distance d between the incentre and circumcentre of a circle, as a function of the inradius r and circumradius R: :d=\\\\sqrt{R(R-2r)}. An immediate consequence is the related inequality R\\\\ge 2r. Although these results are named for Leonhard Euler, who published them in 1765, they were found earlier by Chapple, in a 1746 essay in The Gentleman's Magazine. In the same work he stated that, when two circles are the incircle and circumcircle of a triangle, then there is an infinite family of triangles for which they are the incircle and circumcircle. This is the triangular case of Poncelet's closure theorem, which applies more generally to polygons of any number of sides and to conics other than circles. It is the first known mathematical publication on pairs of inscribed and circumscribed circles of polygons, and significantly predates Poncelet's own 1822 work in this area. Three altitudes of a triangle meet at the orthocentre In 1749, Chapple published the first known proof of the existence of the orthocentre of a triangle, the point where the three perpendiculars from the vertices to the sides meet. The orthocentre itself was known previously, but Chapple writes that its existence was \\"often taken for granted, but no where demonstrated\\". Chapple learned of the problem of valuation of annuities through his correspondence with John Rowe and Thomas Simpson, and carried out this valuation for Courtenay. In this, he became one of the first mathematicians to work on this problem, along with Simpson, Abraham de Moivre, James Dodson, and William Jones.

One of the implementations HealthSetGo added to schools was by conducting a health assessment during school to monitor children's health and development. This also meant that early signs of disease were caught quickly and dealt with. At the end of the medical exams, the schools were then given advice on how to improve and assess future health related issues.

This was the first Parliament after the Reform Act 1832. Not wishing to have an inexperienced Speaker preside over the reformed Parliament, the government persuaded the long-serving incumbent Speaker Charles Manners- Sutton to postpone his retirement. He was standing for a seventh term as Speaker. Joseph Hume (Radical) objected that Manners-Sutton, a vocal opponent of the reform, should not preside over a reformed Parliament. He proposed Edward Littleton (Whig). Daniel O'Connell (Irish Nationalist) seconded. Viscount Morpeth, although a Whig, commended Manners-Sutton's conduct as Speaker, and proposed him. Sir Francis Burdett (Radical) seconded. A debate ensued. Littleton spoke against his own nomination, stating his support for Manners-Sutton and asking that Manners-Sutton be elected without a division. O'Connell objected to this: he would not countenance a Tory Speaker after the reform, believing that \\"the grand advantage of the Reform Bill was to put down Toryism in England — that vile and abominable system, which existed by the plunder of the people, and by the usurpation of their rights\\". Among other objections to Manners-Sutton was the pension awarded on the basis that he was retiring: if re-elected he might draw both a pension and a salary. Voting on Hume's motion that Littleton take the Chair, the motion was defeated by 31 votes to 241, a majority of 210.

She is best known for translating Anne of Green Gables by L.M. Montgomery to Japanese.  Early life and education  Muraoka was born on June 21, 1893, in Kofu, Yamanashi Prefecture. Her birth name was Hana Annaka. Her parents were Methodists, and she was raised a devout Christian. She studied at the Tokyo Eiwa Jogakuin, and began writing children's stories when she was encouraged by translator Hiroko Katayama. She graduated from school in 1913.  Career  After graduation, Muraoka returned to Yamanashi and taught at a branch of the Tokyo Eiwa Jogakuin there. In 1917 she published her first book, Rohen. She married Keizo Muraoka in 1919. They had a son in 1920. In 1926, after Keizo's printing company went bankrupt after the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake, they restarted the company in their home. Soon after that, their son died, leaving Muraoka depressed. Katayama encouraged her to translate Mark Twain's The Prince and the Pauper, and this helped her resume her normal routine. In 1932, Muraoka started a radio show in which she would read the news to children. The show became very popular, and children all over Japan called her the \\"Rajio no Obasan\\" (Aunty Radio). The show ended in the early 1940s as World War II began. Muraoka did not want to read news that referred to Canadians as the enemy because many of her friends were Canadian. In 1939 Muraoka was given a copy of Anne of Green Gables by her friend Loretta Leonard Shaw, a Canadian missionary. Muraoka translated it during the war, bringing the draft with her during air raids. The book was published in 1952 and became a bestseller. It was even added to the Japanese school curriculum in the 1970s. Some translators later criticized Muraoka's translation because she had omitted some parts. Muraoka planned her first trip to Prince Edward Island in 1968. She was never able to visit before she died of a stroke on October 25, 1968. A television drama called Hanako to Anne was broadcast in 2014. It was based on a book about her life titled An no Yurikago Muraoka Hanako no Shogai, which was written by her granddaughter, Eri Muraoka.

Plot  Dana Mills wakes up unsure of what has happened to her or why she is pregnant. She knows she is a member of the marines. She is interrogated and ends up in a mental hospital from which she escapes. She ends up near Herot Hall, a development built on top of the town where she used to live. She hides inside the mountain behind it, which has an abandoned train station and a lake; people think it is haunted. In it she gives birth to her son, Gren. As Gren grows older, he wishes to meet the people in Herot and becomes friends with Dylan, a young boy in the town despite his mother's instructions. Willa, the mother of Dylan, is introduced. Her mother, Diane, forced her into a marriage with Roger Herot, a man of good social standing. She acts as the perfect housewife (hiding alcoholism, a likely eating disorder, an unhappy marriage, and copious quantities of stress) and quickly notices something is amiss when Dylan begins to talk about his \\"imaginary\\" friend Gren. After a disastrous house party where Dana appears searching for her son, who has run down to play with Dylan, and Dylan runs away with Gren as Roger gets killed by a bear, police office Ben Woolf goes searching for Dylan. He claims he killed Dana and Gren and brings Dylan back. He is acclaimed as a hero and Willa marries Ben. Years later, Dylan runs away from the boarding school he has been placed in due to rebellious behaviors to find Gren. Dana, who has been slipping further from reality, argues that the people of Herot are evil – they dug into the mountain and disturbed a graveyard where her mother was buried, turning it into a museum. Gren argues that Dylan was good and finally leaves, going to look for him. They meet and kiss but are found by Ben and Willa, who stabs Dylan. Gren vows for revenge and reconciles with Dana; together they attack Ben at Dylan's funeral. Gren is killed by Ben; everyone realizes he is a boy, not a monster. As Ben and Willa are put in handcuffs, Willa realizes all the peopIe of Herot Hall are monsters.  Structure and techniques  Each of the sections begins with a possible translation of \\"Hwaet\\", the word that begins Beowulf. The sections are told from different perspectives: Dana narrates in first person, Willa and Ben in third, and the ancestors living in the mountain, mothers of Herot, and dogs in first person plural.  Themes  Headley makes many references to modern police violence (especially against African Americans), social media usage, class differences, and feminine stereotypes.  Response  The New York Times claimed Headley brought Beowulf into the 21st century \\"in a curious way.\\" The Guardian noted, \\"The question in Headley's ambitious novel is why we need to cast anyone as a monster at all.\\" The Mere Wife was nominated for the 2019 World Fantasy Award for Best Novel.

History  A lifelong Methodist, Cephas. Barker was born in 1818 in Chatham, Kent County, to a devout Baptist father. He came to Bowmanville in 1867 after leaving Ontario in 1856, having spent years in the navy and nearly a decade as a Superintendent Minister on Prince Edward Island. Barker was the manager of the Merchant, which had a circulation of 1,000 in the townships of Darlington, Clarke and Cartwright, publishing on Fridays with a 75 cent per annum fee for subscription. Paul Trebilcock was the editor, a stationer and bookseller as Barker was. Trebilcock was also a member of YMCA and an agent for Travellers Insurance. Trebilcock continued to operate as a book and recreation goods seller with ads in the succeeding publication to the Merchant, the Canadian Statesman. Trebilcock’s son Arthur J. would be best known as president of the Toronto Stock Exchange, retiring in 1958 at the age of 70. Arthur was the son of Paul and his wife Christina, who married in 1875. Local event listings in the Canadian Statesman have Paul Trebilcock still alive in 1922. The paper generally contained a number of front page columns devoted to literature, poetry, letters to the editor, tips for the farm and household, and plenty of columns for advertisements, including Barker’s own “People Book Store and Sabbath School Depot.” Barker was also a member of the Board of Trustees for the town, where reports of his meetings published in the Merchant regularly showed the liberal leaning Barker clashing with the Conservative John McClung. The paper itself did not have specific columns reporting on the events of other communities, but is an excellent source of examples for advertising, goods and services, and illustrated classifieds of the time. Literature generally had a number of columns devoted to it on the front page, as well as international topics and provincial news. Three years before the Merchant began, Barker was editor and publisher of The Observer, an eight page Bible Christian denominational newspaper. Paul Trebilcock also acted as foreman for that paper when it was being printed in the Horsey Block. As well as running the West Durham Steam Printing House, Barker sold books and goods from his King Street office. One such book is History of the Early Settlement of Bowmanville and Vicinity by John T. Coleman, printed 1875 and regarding history and zoology of the region. Barker held his position for 14 years until being succeeded by H. John Nott, though he only published for three more years until July 1st, 1884. This was due to a $55,000 deficit, possibly incurred by a saturated marketplace of Methodist papers. Cephas was married to Elizabeth Barker, whose obituary he printed in the March 12th, 1875 issue. Barker’s own funeral took place on November 16th, 1881 in London, Ontario, and was attended by many of his fellow Bible Christians, five years after the Merchant had been absorbed by the Canadian Statesman.

In his lifetime, Datta was renowned for his significant contributions to the Ayurveda system of medicine, primarily through his academic commentaries on the primary texts on the field. He is considered to have had a notable impact on Indian medicine through his work. Life Chakrapani Datta was believed to have been born in the latter half of the 11th century in the village of Mayureswar, located in what is now West Bengal. He was a Brahmin and belonged to a noble Vaidya family, with his father having served as a kitchen superintendent for the Pala emperor, Nayapala. His elder brother Bhanu is described as having been an Antaranga (learned physician). A Pala courtier, Naradatta, acted as Datta's spiritual teacher. Datta began to gain prominence at a young age through his commentaries on the primary Ayurveda texts: the Charaka Samhita and the Sushruta Samhita. Among his most celebrated works are Chikitsasamgraha (Collection of medical practices and procedures), Dravyaguna (Properties of plants), and Sarvasarsamgraha (Collection of the essence of things). These discussed therapeutic, surgical and physiological treatments to disease and have led to him being regarded as an authority in Ayurveda medicine. His being the first to incorporate metallic recipes among his creed is also considered notable, with one historian arguing that it \\"introduced a new era in medical science\\". Datta's accomplishments earned him the exalted titles of Charaka Cheturanana, Sushruta Sahasranayana and Mahamahopadhyaya. His contributions to Sanskrit grammar and Nyaya philosophy are also considered to be noteworthy. They are most prominently shown through his compilation of the Shabdachandrika dictionary and annotations on Gauatama's Nyāya Sūtras respectively. Through his work, Datta amassed a significant fortune, allowing his descendants to become prominent zamindars, a role they continued in into the 20th century.

Owned by Postmedia Network, it published papers every Tuesday.  History  The Kingsville Reporter origins are somewhat hazy, but most agree that the paper began in 1873 with S. A. King, son of the town’s namesake Colonel James King. Born on January 23, 1844, Sydney Arthur King received his medical degree from Victoria College in 1866, marrying Esther Wigle, daughter of Member of Parliament Solomon Wigle, in the early 1870s. Some documents point to an A. C. McLellan having a senior position at the paper in 1876, as well as an 1880 issue listing R. A. Hughes as publisher. King would be involved with the paper until 1889, passing away in 1907. King had numerous business interests during his life, including the Wheeler Steamship Co., Manitoulin Lumber Co., numerous oil/gas companies and was the first president of the Detroit River Railroad in 1889. He was a Conservative politically, served as Reeve of Kingsville for eight years, and a prominent member of the Church of England. S. T. Corpus would take over in 1889 as editor and publisher, a village clerk of Kingsville. Corpus would only be around until 1893, when he left to follow King into the lucrative natural gas business, stemming from discoveries made during King's overseeing of construction of Hiram Walker’s summer hotel, The Mettawas. Walker and King were also directors of the Lake Erie Navigation Co. The paper historically served the communities of Kingsville, Barretville, Arner, Cottam, Ruthven, New California, 4th Concession, Leamington, Amherstburg, Zion, Leamington, Gosfield, North Ridge, Arner, Salem, Trinity, Tilbury, Harrow and Essex. A per annum subscription of $2 garnered an 8 page, 7 column sheet, with a circulation of 500 for the 1,700 person community of Kingsville in the 1920s. William H. Hellems joined the paper in 1889, after working at the Brantford Expositor and then as the foreman of the Welland Printing and Publishing Company from 1878 to 1883. He then spent four years with the Ridgetown Plaindealer, and another five years with the Essex Liberal, both in the same capacity as with Welland. Hellems was born May 15th, 1856 in Kelvin, Norfolk County. On April 13th, 1881, he married Victoria Buchner, having three daughters. One of those daughters, Bertha, would work as a journalist for the paper and act as the paper’s representative in the delegation of the Canadian Weekly Newspaper Association's tour to England in 1924. A Methodist, Hellems would be a staunch proponent of Prohibition and the Local option, running the paper until 1938 and passing away January 23rd, 1943. David P. Connery assumed Hellems' position in 1938, bringing investment to the paper with modern facilities and equipment. During Hellems’ tenure the paper had moved from the north side of Main Street, third street west of Division Street, onto Division Street North in 1921. Two years after Connery joined the paper, they were located on the second floor above a Dominion grocery store on the site, until moving to the current offices at 17 Chestnut Street in 1970.

Conklin (1911 - 1977) was a barrister and left the paper to become a member of the Ontario Water Resources Committee, acting as an associate editor while with the paper. The two published the paper as Lakeshore Publishers Limited. Sims, a member of the Lions Club, Essex Tourist Association and Chamber of Commerce, acted as editor and publisher until his death in 1978. Upon his passing his wife Mildred ( - 2007) took over as publisher for ten years when their son, Greg, would purchase the paper with his wife Rita. Greg is credited with shooting some of the photos for the paper in 1980s and writing the Grist Gallery column. Greg continued with the paper until 2001, and his wife Rita stayed on after the sale of the paper to Postmedia in 2007. The paper continues to publish with Nelson Santos as editor and mayor of the town in 2016.

The band's best-known incarnation consisted of Petr Muk on vocals, Petr Kučera on keyboards, Jan Vozáry on drums, and Dušan Vozáry on second keyboards. The band underwent a few personnel changes during their early period in the 1980s, and broke up in 1993. They returned in 2011 with a new lineup consisting of Jitka Charvátová (vocals), Petr Kučera (keyboards), Jan Vozáry (drums), and Petr Hons (guitars). The band plays synth-pop and new wave music, and was originally heavily influenced by the British duo Erasure. History Oceán was founded in August 1985. The band members met in high school and had already played together in various underground bands. Michaela Klimková, who went on to marry Petr Muk, was their original vocalist, and Muk played bass. Zdeněk Pavelec was the band's guitarist, but after keyboardist Dušan Vozáry, Jan's brother, joined in 1987, briefly making Oceán a five-piece, Pavelec left and the band's sound, now devoid of guitars, became more synth-oriented. Oceán also worked regularly with Petr Hons, who was unofficially part of the band and who wrote most of their song lyrics. Hons later became a full member after the band regrouped in 2011. 1988 saw the release of Oceán's first single \\"Ráchel / Dávná zem\\" on Supraphon Records. \\"Lék světu / Jeden den\\" followed in 1989, and the same year the band's idols, British synth-pop duo Erasure, visited Prague on their European tour. From December 1989 to January 1990, Oceán supported Erasure on their UK & Ireland tour, which turned out to be a big success for the Czech band. In March 1990, they recorded their debut album Dávná zem (Ancient land) at the Opus Records studio in Bratislava. The album was a commercial success, and in the following year, Oceán recorded the follow-up album Pyramida snů (Pyramid of dreams). In July 1991, they performed at the Wallenstein Palace, and the performance was recorded by Czechoslovak Television. The band experienced a steep rise in popularity and went on to record several music videos in Greece. At the beginning of 1992, their maxi single \\"Haifa\\" came out, containing four remixes of songs from the album Pyramida snů, and in the same year, the compilation 2 1/2 was released, featuring unreleased demos and other tracks. In 1992, Petr Muk, Petr Kučera, and Oceán's lyricist Petr Hons created a new project, titled Shalom, which continued after the breakup of Oceán. In 2011, Oceán reunited. The late Petr Muk was replaced by vocalist Jitka Charvátová. At the end of 2014, Dušan Vozáry left the group. They have since released two studio albums, Ve smíru in 2016 and Femme Fatale in 2018.

Biography The Razgildeevs were a Baikal Cossack family, originating from the Trans-Baikal region. The head of the family, Anempodist Ivanovich Razgildeev, also known as Aleksandr, had served at Chindant, and then at Aksha as a border commandant with the rank of major. From there he moved to Kyakhta in 1842, and then to Verkhneudinsk, where he was chieftain of the Trans-Baikal Cossack Regiment. His son, , served in the army, rising to the rank of general. Anempodist's younger brother, Yevgraf Ivanovich Razgildeev, had four sons, Ivan, Aleksandr, Mikhail and Andrei. They studied at Nerchinsk Mining School and then at the in Saint Petersburg. Ivan Razgildeev was born in the village of Tsurukhaytuy in Irkutsk Governorate, now Priargunsk, in 1811. He became the head of the Nerchinsk gold mining operations, gaining a reputation for cruelty. He was later replaced by his brother Mikhail. Of the other brothers, became a prominent architect, while Andrei was a land planner for private gold mining enterprises in the Verkhnevilyuysky and Olyokminsky Districts. Ivan Razgildeev graduated from the Mountain Cadet Corps in 1830 with a silver medal. He participated in the geological exploration of the and discovered the Altangan gold deposits in the Tsagan-Oluysky valley, now part of the modern Borzinsky District. He was manager of the gold mines established along the Kara River from 1850 until 1852, and then the works arouned Nerchinsk from 1852 to 1856. The mining works used prison labour from inmates exiled to Siberia, termed katorga, with the Kara and Nerchinsk katorgas being particularly infamous examples. During Razgildeev's tenure, round-the-clock mining, and the use of an ore-washing of his own invention, allowed an annual gold production of some 100 pounds. The particularly harsh conditions during this period gave rise to the term \\"Razgildeevshchina\\", and an investigation was opened into conditions. Razgildeev was brought to trial in 1855, but was protected by the Governor of East Siberia, Nikolay Muravyov-Amursky, and was acquitted. In literature Razgildeev's prominent association with the harshness of prison labour conditions in the mid-nineteenth century entered into later works on the tsarist prison regime by a number of writers, including Vlas Doroshevich, Peter Kropotkin and Pyotr Yakubovich. Yakubovich, in his work In the World of the Outcasts, imagined a fictional ending for Razgildeev, with two convicts recounting how after his cruelty came to light, Razgildeev was \\"stripped entirely of his titles... [and] positions,\\" and just before this, he was ordered to appear before the tsar. He had never made to the Tsar, however, as a Tartar inmate named Baidaulov recognized him and beat him nearly to death. Razgildeev died from injuries days before reaching the tsar. Kropotkin, who had visited the Nerchinsk operations in the early 1860s while serving as aide- de-camp to the Governor of Transbaikalia, General Boleslar Kazimirovich Kukel, observed in his work In Russian and French Prisons, that \\"the arbitrary despotism of the directors of prisons had no limits, and the dreadful tales which circulated in Transbaikalia about one of them--Razghildeeff--were fully confirmed.\\" Doroshevich mentioned Razgildeev in his work Sakhalin, based on his visits to the region in the late 1890s, recording inmates making reference to the \\"Razgildeev regime\\".

Africa In the African region, Countries such as Mozambique have taken the lead in bilingual education. The Ministry of Education and Human Development has made primary education fully bilingual in 2017. Children will be taught 16 Mozambican dialects during their early years of schooling. Many African states introduce mother languages as subjects and education tools along commonly spoken international or foreign languages. Mother language instruction is terminated immediately during the schooling cycle and leaves only the international language established. It becomes a disadvantage that contributes to substantial lack of motivation on the part of teachers, students, and parents. =Senegal= Although bilingual schools exist, the majority of Senegalese schools teach in French and follow the French system. However, studies have shown that approximately 80% of teachers use a 'local language' in order to communicate with all of their students.United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. International Bureau of Education. \\"World Data on Education, Senegal\\". UNESCO-IBE, 2010. Web. (in French) Asia Asia is the Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres. It includes a large number of countries, some of which are grouped into subregions. =China= In the autonomous regions of China many children of the country's major ethnic minorities attend public schools where the medium of instructions is the local language, such as e.g. Uyghur or Tibetan. Traditionally, the textbooks there were little different from merely a translated version of the books used in the Chinese schools throughout the country; however, as of 2001, a move was on foot to create more teaching materials with locally-based content. Classes of Mandarin as second language are also offered in these minority schools, and the central government makes increasing efforts to make them more effective. A law passed in February 2001 provided for the Mandarin-as-second-language classes in the ethnic-minority schools to start in the early years of elementary school whenever local conditions permit, rather than in the senior years of elementary school, as it was practiced before.Zhou (2004), pp. 119-120 On the other hand, it has been reported that Chinese has been used as the medium of instructions in some autonomous counties even though less than 50% of the population \\"spoke and understood some Chinese\\"; this mismatch was thought to have contributed to the low grades earned by the students on the math and Chinese exams.Zhou (2004), p. 88  Hong Kong  In Hong Kong where both English and Cantonese are official, both languages are taught in school and are mandatory subjects. Either English or Cantonese is used as the medium of instruction for other subjects. Increasingly, there are a large number of Mandarin Chinese-speaking schools in operation throughout Hong Kong as well since 1996. Study of Mandarin is mandatory in junior years (from Grade 1 to Grade 9). Hong Kong also has a bilingual education program using both Cantonese and Hong Kong Sign Language. Macau Chinese and Portuguese are the official languages of Macau, but English plays an unofficial and highly prominent role. English is the language of instruction at the University of Macau and at some secondary schools. Other schools use Cantonese as the language of instruction. there was one Portuguese-medium school. Tibet Education in the Tibet Autonomous Region is provided in Tibetan and in Standard Mandarin Chinese. The Chinese government intended to maintain language diversity while increasing the Mandarin language skills of Tibetan students. However, it is alleged that the education system downplays the importance of Tibetan, and that mathematics, science and social studies classes are only taught in Mandarin. It has been alleged that a reduction of the use of Tibetan in bilingual education is a human rights issue. =Japan= In Japan, the need for bilingualism (mostly Japanese and English) has been pointed out, and there are some scholars who advocate teaching children subjects such as mathematics using English rather than Japanese. As part of this proposal, subjects such as history, however, would be taught solely in Japanese. On the island of Hokkaido, the indigenous and endangered Ainu language is receiving newfound interest with establishment of a small number of bilingual Ainu-Japanese elementary schools. The largest non-Japanese, non- native to Japan minority are the Koreans. Bilingual education in Korean language is provided by Korean international schools, more of which are affiliated with Chongryon. =Middle East= The Arab World Schools in the Middle East follow dual or triple language programmes. The triple language programme is most commonly found in Lebanon, Tunisia, Syria, and often implemented as well in Egypt. History, grammar, literature and the Arabic language are taught in the native language (Arabic), whereas Mathematics and sciences are generally taught in English and/or French. In Lebanon, however, science and mathematics are taught in either French or English, depending on the school's administration or the grade level. It is not uncommon to find French- or English- only schools, though usually these institutions are primarily international establishments. In most Gulf countries as well as Jordan, English is introduced as a second language early on alongside the primary medium of instruction, Arabic. In Iraq however, triple language programmes are, like in Lebanon and Syria, normal, except rather than using French, Kurdish is taught alongside Arabic and English due to Iraq's considerably sized Kurdish minority in the north, and bilingual official language policy regarding Kurdish. In Morocco, Berber can be used as a regional medium of elementary education, with widespread use of French and Arabic in higher grades. Due to Morocco's history of French colonialism, sole French-medium education is very widespread. In certain areas, Spanish is taught instead of French because of former Spanish colonization of small parts of the country. Israel Normally, Israelis are taught in either Hebrew or Arabic depending on religion and ethnicity. Within the standard education system, thorough study of English is compulsory, and depending on the primary medium of education, Arabic or Hebrew are introduced as third languages with significantly lesser emphasis placed on achieving solid proficiency. Within Hebrew-medium programmes, other foreign languages such as French, German, Russian, or Yiddish can often be studied as well. Israel is also home to several international schools whereby the sole medium of education is either English or French. In general, as English is taught early on across all Israeli schools, most Israelis become comfortably bilingual, much like what one would see in The Netherlands or Scandinavian countries. This in combination with a large proportion of English-language programming on television that is merely subtitled and seldom dubbed. Recent peace initiatives have also led to a small number of bilingual and multi-religious schools in which both Hebrew and Arabic are used in equal emphasis. The Hand in Hand: Center for Jewish Arab Education in Israel runs four bilingual schools, and the Neve Shalom peace village also hosts a local school. =Mongolia= There has been long-standing encouragement to teach at least one other language other than Mongolian. Traditionally Russian language was taught during middle school and high school. After the 1990 transition to democracy, English language has been gaining more ground in Mongolian schools. Today many public schools at all levels teach one other language that are usually English, Russian, Korean, Japanese or Chinese. Although the core curriculum is in Mongolian, it is generally encouraged by the government and the public that the students should have some command of a secondary language when they graduate from high school. Also there are other private schools that teach their curricula in English. =South Asia= South Asia is the southern region of the Asian continent, comprising the sub-Himalayan South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries and, for some authorities, adjoining countries to the west and east. Bangladesh In Bangladesh, Bengali is the first language. However, it has a colonial past and English is widely used in administrations, schools, courts, etc. Bangladeshi children start English as Second Language quite early in their age (mostly from age 5–6). In National Curriculum, English is given an importance and it is taught compulsorily until twelfth grade. There are Government approved curriculum as well as other international systems of Educations which maintains English as a 'medium of instruction'. India The official languages of the Union of India are Hindi and English, with 21 other regional languages holding co-official status, including: Assamese, Bengali, Bodo, Dogri, Gujarati, Kannada, Kashmiri, Konkani, Maithili, Malayalam, Manipuri, Marathi, Nepali, Odia, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Santali, Sindhi, Tamil, Telugu and Urdu. Education in India follows the Three-language formula, where children are to be taught English (or the medium of instruction in the school, grades 1-12), The Second Language (grades 1-10) is the Official language of the state (In most non-Hindi states) or Hindi (in the others), in a few states some schools offer a choice between the State Language and Hindi, and the third language (grades 5-8, often Hindi (in the non-Hindi states), the regional language of the state (if the student opted for Hindi as the second language, a foreign language or Sanskrit). An exception is Tamil Nadu where only Tamil and English are taught. English-medium schools often find favour with parents, especially in urban areas, due to English's international prestige, India's Colonial heritage, its usage in Indian business and it being the medium of instruction in most Indian universities. Pakistan In Pakistan, English is used widely to communicate about state affairs. A student is expected in Pakistan to work in multiple languages such as Urdu, English and an indigenous language. An issue that arises from this expectation of students, is their ability to learn these languages. Teachers in Pakistan are not always necessarily trained to teach a language, therefore there is a difficulty within students learning these languages. Teachers as well as the students rely on textbooks to learn/teach these languages. The bilingual education system is not as proficient as it could be in Pakistan. =Southeast Asia= Southeast is a subregion of Asia, consisting of the countries that are geographically south of China, east of India, west of New Guinea and north of Australia. Philippines In July 2009 Department of Education moved towards mother-tongue based learning initially by issuing an order which allowed two alternative three-year bridging plans. Depending on the bridging plan adopted, the Filipino and English languages are to be phased in as the language of instruction beginning in the third and fourth grades.. DepEd Order 74 of 2009 (PDF, archived from the original on 2010-08-21)) Other Philippine regional languages are taught in schools, colleges and universities located in their respective provinces. In 2007, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo signed a directive in Spain that would reintroduce teaching and learning the Spanish language in the Philippine school system starting in 2008. The order, Memorandum Order No. 276, s. 2007, issued on November 29, 2007, ordered the Department of Education to encourage the teaching and learning of the Spanish language throughout the country. Singapore In Singapore, education is bilingual. The medium of instruction is in English and the learning of the mother tongue is compulsory. The mother tongue subject is usually Mandarin, Malay or Tamil, the other official languages of Singapore. They are taught till pre-university level. Previously, students either attended an English- medium or a \\"vernacular school\\", which taught in one of the mother tongues. In 1960, government legislation standardised the primary medium of instruction to English, with the different vernacular languages (\\"mother tongue\\") allocated as the second language. Students may also choose to learn a third language (German, French, Japanese, etc.) in secondary school and junior college or, if their respective school does not offer the language, at a MOE Language Centre. This option is limited however, to the top 10% of any PSLE cohort; prospective third language students must have also scored A grades for English and their second language. Singaporean students returning from abroad who did not learn a second language may be exempted from their mother tongue and learn another second language in place of the mother tongue; however, such exemptions are rare and only granted on a case-to-case basis. Thailand and Malaysia Since the mid-1990s bilingual approaches to schooling and higher education have become popular in parts of South-east Asia, especially in Thailand and Malaysia where different models have been applied, from L2 immersion (content taught in a non-native language) to parallel immersion, where core subjects are taught in both the mother-tongue and a second language (usually English). English has been taught in schools in Malaysia as it is a Commonwealth country (former British colony). During the 1980s to 1990s, when schools were nationalised under the government of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, English became a second language instead of the primary language of instruction. The Malaysian government reversed its decision to have Maths and Science taught in English, but is implementing different programmes designed to improve English language teaching within schools. The decision has raised numerous debates, with various groups arguing for and against the use of English in schools. With the existence of vernacular schools and prominent usage of dialects, some Chinese and Indian children become trilingual, speaking Malay, English and their mother tongue or dialect. However, English is still widely spoken as a de facto language of trade and academia. The English for Integrated Studies (EIS) project model initiate in 2003 at Sunthonphu Pittaya Secondary School(SPSS), Rayong, Thailand, is an exemplar of the use of English for integrated studies in Math, Science and IT, taught by non-native English speaking Thai teachers. In the year 2015 expanded to 500 schools all region of Thailand. This project is under the auspices of the International Study Program of Burapha University. Wichai Wittaya Bilingual School in Chaing Mai (1995), Siriwat Wittaya Bilingual School in Bangkok(2004), Chindemanee School English Program (2005), The Sarasas model, pioneered by the Sarasas schools affiliation in Thailand, are exemplars of parallel immersion. Panyaden School is an example of a private bilingual school in North Thailand that provides its students with a Thai-English education (each class has a Thai teacher and native-English speaking teacher). The difficulties and disputes characteristic of the US experience have not been replicated in these Asian countries, though they are not without controversy. Generally, it can be said that there is widespread acknowledgment of the need to improve English competence in the population, and bilingual approaches, where language is taught through subject content, are seen to be the most effective means of attaining this. The most significant limiting factors are the shortage of teachers linguistically competent to teach in a second language and the costs involved in use of expatriate native speakers for this purpose. Australia In Australia, some schools teach bilingual programs that cater to children speaking languages other than English. Baldauf(2005) explains that these programs are now beginning to benefit from more government support. Bilingual education for Indigenous students, however, has only received intermittent official backing. In the Northern Territory, for example, bilingual programs for Indigenous students begun with Federal Government support in the early 1970s, but by December 1998 the Northern Territory Government had announced its decision to shift $3 million away from the 29 bilingual programs to a Territory-wide program teaching English as a second language. Within 12 months though the government had softened its position. Most bilingual programs were allowed to continue under the guise of two-way education. Then on 24 August 2005, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training announced that the government would be \\"revitalizing bi-lingual education\\" at 15 Community Education Centres: Alekarenge, Angurugu, Borroloola, Gapuwiyak, Gunbalanya, Kalkaringi, Lajamanu, Maningrida, Milingimbi, Ramingining, Ngukurr, Shepherdson College, Numbulwar, Yirrkala and Yuendumu. This revitalisation is conceived as part of an effort aimed at \\"providing effective education from pre-school through to senior secondary at each of the Territory's 15 Community Education Centres\\". As Harris & Devlin (1986) observe, \\"Aboriginal bilingual education in Australia represents much more than a range of education programs. It has been a measure of non-Aboriginal commitment to either assimilation or cultural pluralism\\". In 2008 it again shifted with the government attempting to force the nine remaining bilingual schools to teach the first four hours of classes in English. Europe The European Schools group is a network of thirteen private schools in EU countries that provide multilingual and multicultural education at nursery, primary and secondary levels. =Belgium= Belgium has three official languages: Dutch, French and German. The constitution guarantees free education, so private schools can use any language, but state(-recognised) schools teach in the language of the language area where it is located. For Brussels, which is an officially bilingual French-Dutch area, schools use either Dutch or French as medium. Even though Belgium has two major languages (Dutch in Flanders, and French in Wallonia), bilingual instruction does rarely occur since Belgian law only permits education in one official language. In Flanders, bilingual instruction is only allowed as a short-term project. =France= France has one official language, French. However, regional provincial languages including Corsican, Breton, Gallo, Basque, Franco-Provençal, Occitan, and Catalan have charter protection, and bilingual education programmes and regional language course electives have been established. However, due to the strict French-language policy imposed by national government, there is no centrally allocated funding for any of these programmes. All funding is at the municipal level, with many of the regional languages face extreme endangerment. France is known for wanting to maintain its lingual and cultural roots, and speaking a language other than French or mixing French with other languages is looked down on. This is apparent the French educational system, where French is highly prioritized over other languages and emphasis is put not only on the maintenance of the French language, but also on pushing students not to integrate French with other languages. =Netherlands= In the Netherlands, there are around 100 bilingual schools. In these schools, the first language is Dutch, whereas the second language is usually English and occasionally German. In the province of Friesland, where West Frisian is an official language, some primary schools are trilingual, teaching in Dutch, West Frisian, and English. Most bilingual secondary schools are TVWO (Bilingual Preparatory Scientific Education), but THAVO (Bilingual Higher General Secondary Education) and TVMBO-TL (Bilingual Preparatory Vocational Education - Theoretical Learning Pathway) have been introduced, too. =Republic of Ireland= The Republic of Ireland has two official languages, Irish and English. With the Irish language facing endangerment, as well as the presence of regions where Irish is still spoken as native (referred to as the Gaeltacht), the Irish constitution protects and reserves the right for education to be established through the medium of either official language, and it thus is. An Irish-medium school is referred to as Gaelscoil (plural, Gaelscoileanna) This movement has been met with some success in that 10% of the schooling in Ireland is conducted in Irish. The movement has also been successful in setting up schools in both urban and rural areas, ranging from Dublin and Cork, to the traditional Gaeltacht regions. =Latvia= According to the State Language Law, the official state language of Latvia is Latvian, however national minority education programmes are provided in 7 languages: Russian, Polish, Hebrew, Ukrainian, Estonian, Lithuanian, and Belarussian. In 2018 there were a total of 104 educational institutions implementing minority education programs. 94 schools were implementing education programs in Russian and bilingually, 4 – in Polish and bilingually, 1 – in Ukrainian and bilingually, 2 – in Hebrew, 1 – in Latvian and Lithuanian, and 1 – in Latvian and Estonian, but 68 schools had both Latvian and minority language programmes. =Spain= Spain adopted bilingual education in 1966 with the agreement between the National Spanish Ministry of Education and British Council. They decided to attempt this with an immersion program. This agreement was done to encourage cultural diversity through learning two languages. Spain promoted additive bilingual education in English, and many natives from The United States, Great Britain, and Ireland worked as assistants in the bilingual classrooms. Andalusia In Andalusia (Spain's southernmost region), things have changed drastically concerning bilingual education since the introduction of the Plurilingualism Promotion Plan by the autonomous government. The plan was born as the realization for the Andalusian territory of the European language policies regarding the teaching and learning of languages. With special strength in the past ten years bilingual education has worked at most elementary schools. In addition to this new European scene, the Scheme for the Promotion of Plurilingualism has learned a lot from the first experimental bilingual sections set up in some schools by the Andalusian government in 1998. Following the content-based approach, French and German were used to partly teach other subjects. This successful experience, as show the international tests that the students have been given, is the starting point for a more ambitious scene, where 400 schools will be involved in the next four years, more languages, especially English, will take part, and a lot of investigation and implementation of the Integrated Curriculum of languages must be carried out. Being aware of the necessity of the Andalusian people to adapt to the new scenario, a major government plan, called \\"strategies for the second modernization of Andalusia\\", was designed in 2003. The document also underlined language diversity as a source of richness and a valuable heritage of humankind that needs to be looked after. It was then clear that a scheme was needed to carry out this new language policy in the territory, especially affecting education, with clear goals, timing and funding. The scheme is to be developed through five major programmes and also an organization and assessment plan. The programmes are: *Bilingual schools *Official Schools of Languages *Plurilingualism and teachers *Plurilingualism and society *Organization and assessment plan. Basque Country, Navarre, Galicia, Catalonia, Valencia and the Balearic Islands In addition to Castilian Spanish being the primary official language of Spain, the kingdom also has several co-official regional languages which enjoy equal and unbiased constitutional protection and promotion: Catalan/Valencian (in Catalonia, Valencia and the Balearic Islands), Galician (in Galicia), Basque (in the Basque Country and the northern zone of Navarre) and Aranese (in Val d'Aran, Catalonia). Many schools are bilingual in the regional language as well as Castilian at both the elementary and secondary levels. Regional universities also often provide programmes through the regional medium. Education in all co-official languages uses to receive both national and regional funding. Unlike France in which regional languages face incredible endangerment and possible extinction, Spain's long-established approach to making regional bilingual education mandatory has served often as a model for both the survival and thriving state of the languages indigenous to the country. =Sweden= Sweden has one official language and five recognized minority languages,Hult, F.M. (2004). Planning for multilingualism and minority language rights in Sweden. Language Policy, 3(2), 181-201. though Swedish is to great extent the only one of these in which education is offered. During the 21st century more and more schools started to offer national programs in English. =United Kingdom and dependencies= The British Isles have several indigenous languages apart from English. These include Welsh (official in Wales), Irish, Manx Gaelic, Cornish, Scottish Gaelic, and the Scots language (which is sometimes considered as a dialect of English). Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales, Cornwall, and the Isle of Man have each established bilingual programmes which provide education through the medium of their indigenous language. Most often, except for the cases of Manx and Cornish, these programmes exist where the language is spoken communally as a first language. Wales Roughly a quarter of schoolchildren in Wales now receive their education through the medium of Welsh, and children wishing to join a Welsh medium school () do not have to speak Welsh to go to one if they are young enough to learn the language quickly. Welsh medium education has met with great success across Wales since the first such schools opened in the 1940s. There are current plans to extend further provision in urban centres such as Cardiff, Newport, Swansea and Llanelli to cater for growing demand; this has caused controversy in some areas. Welsh-speaking areas use Welsh-medium education almost exclusively. Parents have a legal right for their children to receive education in Welsh, and each local authority caters for this. In the Western flank of Wales, Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion, Gwynedd and Anglesey, most primary and secondary schools are Welsh medium or have bilingual streams. Some 75-80% of all pupils in Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion receive their education through the medium of Welsh, with this figure increasing in Gwynedd to around 90%. In English-medium schools, the study of Welsh is compulsory and must be taught from age 5 to age 16 in all state-funded schools. Northern Ireland Irish Gaelic received official recognition in Northern Ireland for the first time in 1998 under the Good Friday Agreement. A cross-border body known as Foras na Gaeilge was established to promote the language in both Northern Ireland and the Republic. The British government in 2001 ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Irish Gaelic (in respect only of Northern Ireland) was specified under Part III of the Charter, thus giving it a degree of protection and status somewhat comparable to the Welsh language in Wales and Scottish Gaelic in Scotland. This included a range of specific undertakings in relation to education, translation of statutes, interaction with public authorities, the use of placenames, media access, support for cultural activities and other matters (whilst the Ulster variant of Scots, known as Ulster Scots, was specified under Part II of the Charter.) The Education (Northern Ireland) Order 1998 states: \\"It shall be the duty of the Department (of Education) to encourage and facilitate the development of Irish-medium education.\\" There are no Ulster Scots-medium schools, even at primary level. North America =Canada= English and French In Canada, education is under provincial jurisdiction. However, the federal government has been a strong supporter of establishing Canada as a bilingual country and has helped pioneer the French immersion programs in the public education systems throughout Canada. In French-immersion, students with no previous French language training, usually beginning in Kindergarten or grade 1, do all of their school work in French. Depending on provincial jurisdiction, some provinces also offer an extended French program that begins in grade 5 which offers relatively more courses in French. In this case the student takes French immersion until grade nine but may continue throughout their high school education. Similar English-immersion programmes also exist for Francophone children. Education is generally monolingual in either English or French according to the majority population within which a school is located. The second official language is introduced with allocated time provided each week for instruction in the language as a subject. Quebec Quebec is Canada's only legally monolingual French-speaking province. Based on section 59 of Canada's Constitution Act of 1982, provides that not all of the language rights listed under Canada's official bilingualism policy in previous section 23 will apply in Quebec. Specifically: (1) In Quebec, a child may be educated in English only if at least one parent or a sibling was educated in Canada in English. (2)In New Brunswick, Canada's only officially bilingual province, students have the right to education in the official language which they understand; students able to understand both languages have the right to education in either system. (3) In the rest of Canada, a child may be educated in French if at least one parent or a sibling was educated in Canada in French, or if at least one parent has French as his or her mother tongue (defined in section 23 as \\"first language learned and still understood\\"). One practical consequence of this asymmetry is that all migrants who arrive in Quebec from foreign countries are required to place their children in French-language schools. This includes immigrants whose mother tongue is English and immigrants who received their schooling in English. On the other hand, Section 23 provides a nearly universal right to English-language schooling for the children of Canadian-born anglophones living in Quebec. Section 23 also provides, in theory, a nearly universal right to French-language schooling for the children of all francophones living outside Quebec, including immigrants from French-speaking countries who settle outside Quebec, and who are Canadian citizens. Another element of asymmetry between Quebec and most anglophone provinces is that while Quebec provides public English-language primary and secondary education throughout the province, most other provinces provide French-language education only \\"where numbers warrant.\\" First Nations reserves and Inuit settlements Canada also has bilingual programmes for First Nations' languages on numerous Canadian aboriginal reserves in combination with either English, French, or both. Some programmes are gradually being established, whilst others are already long established. Most notable bilingual programmes that exist include Inuktitut, Inuinnaqtun, Cree, Blackfoot, Ojibwe, Mohawk, Mi'kmaq, and Pacific Coast Salish languages. Many of these programmes were set up in the late 1980s and early 1990s by academic linguists wishing to preserve the languages, respectively - especially in areas where there either is a healthy speaking base, or an endangerment of as low as two remaining speakers of a language. Prior to this, as late as the 1970s and early 1980s, First Nations and Inuit in Canada, as Native Americans in the United States, were forced into residential schools imposed on them by the Canadian government to integrate indigenous cultures into European-Canadian society. This came with the dramatic loss of the languages, religious beliefs, and cultures themselves due to widespread use of corporal punishment and mental abuse. As of 2010, new programmes are mushrooming across Canada to try to save what is left, but are often met with mixed success and funding challenges at federal, provincial, and reserve levels. Other minority languages In the province of British Columbia, the city of Vancouver since 2002 has established a new bilingual Mandarin Chinese-English immersion programme at the elementary school level in order to accommodate Vancouver's both historic and present strong ties to the Chinese-speaking world, already in itself having a very sizeable Chinese population local to the city. Six Vancouver schools have thus far adopted the programme, and a secondary school track to continue thereupon is being designed. Other suburbs within what is referred to as the Greater Vancouver Regional District are also considering adopting the programme into a small number of schools. Similar programmes are being developed for both Hindi and Punjabi to serve in representing the large South Asian cultural community and its interests in the City of Surrey. By default, most schools in British Columbia teach through English, with French immersion options available. In both English and French-medium schools, one can study and take government exams in Japanese, Punjabi, Mandarin Chinese, French, Spanish, and German at the secondary level. In Alberta, the city of Edmonton has had a well established Chinese (Mandarin) bilingual education program (Edmonton Chinese Bilingual Education Association) since 1982. The program is currently offered in 13 schools throughout the city consisting of 6 elementary schools, 4 junior high schools and 3 high schools. Students enrolled in any of the elementary schools spend half a day learning in Chinese and the other half in English. In Manitoba, Ukrainian communities have played an extensive role in the development and history of the province. Bilingual Ukrainian-English education programmes have therefore long been established, alongside smaller programmes introducing and implementing French, Icelandic in the town of Gimli, and First Nations' languages. Private Islamic and Jewish schools across Canada also have bilingual and trilingual programmes that include Arabic or Hebrew, respectively. In Cape Breton and other parts of Nova Scotia, a number of secondary schools now offer the option of taking introductory courses in Scottish Gaelic, as reflecting upon the province's both intimate and dark history with the Gaelic language and Highland Scottish diaspora. =United States= SER-Niños Charter School, a bilingual state charter school in the Gulfton area of Houston, Texas Bilingual education in the U.S. focuses on English Language Learners (ELL). The emphasis on English rejects that the student has a dominant language as part of their identity and culture that will continue to develop with time. According to the U.S. Department of Education website, a bilingual education program is \\"an educational program for limited English proficient students\\". (The Office of English Language Acquisition, 2009). The term \\"limited English proficiency\\" remains in use by the federal government, but has fallen out of favor elsewhere. According to Bankstreet's Literacy Guide this shift is due to the fact that the term ELL represents a more accurate reflection of language acquisition. The term \\"English language learner\\" is now preferred in schools and educational research to refer to a student whose first language is not English and who needs language support services in order to succeed in school. In the United States, proponents of the practice argue that it will not only help to keep non-English-speaking children from falling behind their peers in math, science, and social studies while they master English, but such programs teach English better than English-only programs. For many students, the process of learning literacy and a new language simultaneously is simply an overwhelming task, so bilingual programs began as a way to help such students develop native language literacy first - research by Cummins,(1997) a central researcher in the field, shows that skills such as literacy developed in a first language will transfer to English. Opponents of bilingual education argue that it delays students' mastery of English, thereby retarding the learning of other subjects as well. In California, where at least one-third of students were enrolled in bilingual classes in the mid-1990s, there has been considerable politicking for and against bilingual education. The very first instance of bilingual education in the United States occurred with Polish immigrants in the first permanent English settlement of Virginia in what is now the United States. The Poles provided the community with manufactured pitch necessary to prevent the sinking of ships, and glass works among other industries. When the House of Burgesses met in 1619, the rights extended only to Englishmen. The Poles, in turn, launched the first recorded strike in the New World. In dire need of their skills and industries, the Poles received the \\"rights of Englishmen,\\" and established the first bilingual schools with subjects taught in English and Polish. From this first documented historic beginning, bilingual education existed in some form or another in the United States. During the 18th century, Franciscan missionaries from California to Texas used indigenous languages for translating and teaching the Catholic catechism to Native Americans. By the mid-19th century, private and public bilingual schools had include such native languages as Czech, Dutch, French, German, Norwegian, Spanish, and Swedish. Ohio became the first state in 1839, to adopt a bilingual education law, authorizing German-English instruction at parents' request. Louisiana enacted an identical provision for French and English in 1847, and the New Mexico Territory did so for Spanish and English in 1850. By the end of the 19th century, about a dozen states had passed similar laws. Elsewhere, many localities provided bilingual instruction without state sanction, in languages as diverse as Norwegian, Italian, Polish, Czech, and Cherokee. Beginning in 1959, public schools in Miami introduced bilingual programs. In 1968 the U.S., with Title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, or, informally, the Bilingual Education Act, Congress first mandated bilingual education in order to give immigrants access to education in their \\"first\\" language. The Act was amended in 1988. Federal spending on bilingual education jumped from $7.5 million in 1968 to $150 million by 1979. A 1974 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Lau v. Nichols, gave further momentum to bilingual education. Here, the Court held that San Francisco schools violated minority language students' rights when they educated students in the same classes as other students without special provisions. Taken together, the Bilingual Education Act and the Lau v. Nichols ruling mandated that schools needed to at least provide some type of services to support English language learners, though neither specified what type of educational program needed to be provided. As such, both bilingual and English-only programs flourished after the law's passage and the court ruling. The Bilingual Education Act was terminated in 2001 by new federal education policy, with the passage of No Child Left Behind by the U.S. Congress. This law offers no support for native language learning, but rather emphasized accountability in English only, and mandates that all students, including ELLs, are tested yearly in English. The majority of U.S. high school students in the United States are required to take at least one to two years of a second language. The vast majority of these classes are either French or Spanish. In a large number of schools this is taught in a manner known as FLES, in which students learn about the second language in a manner similar to other subjects such as mathematics or science. Some schools use an additional method known as FLEX in which the \\"nature of the language\\" and culture are also taught. High school education almost never uses \\"immersion\\" techniques. Controversy in the United States In recent times there has been a lot of discussion about bilingual education. In the 2009 U.S. Supreme Court decision, Horne v. Flores, the majority opinion stated, \\"Research on ELL instruction indicates there is documented, academic support for the view that SEI (Structured English Immersion) is significantly more effective than bilingual education.\\" Proponents of bilingual education claim that it is not only easier for students to learn English if they are literate in their first language, but that such students will learn English better and become bilingual and biliterate.(see Krashen, 2002; August & Hakuta, 1997; Crawford, 2000; Cummins, 2000) One study shows that English language learners introduced to a transitional bilingual program gained a fair amount of English comprehension and reading skills. Proponents further claim that effective bilingual programs strive to achieve proficiency in both English and the students' home language. Dual language or Two-Way bilingual programs are one such approach, whereby half of the students speak English and half are considered English language learners (ELLs). The teacher instructs in English and in the ELLs' home language. The dual purpose of this type of classroom is to teach the children a new language and culture, and language diversity in such classrooms is seen as a resource. Programs in English only eradicate the native languages immigrants bring to this country, while dual language bilingual programs serve to maintain such languages in an \\"additive\\" context, where a new language is added without the first being lost. One paper states that two-way developmental bilingual education programs in elementary school have the most success in language minority students' long term academic achievement. These students will maintain their gains in academic performance in secondary level academic classes. Another study shows the positive results of a two-way bilingual education program. Another study suggests that the transitional bilingual education method can improve development of the native language without hindering the development of the English language. Some mistakenly believe that once a student can converse in English (Basic interpersonal communication skills - BICS), they will naturally perform well academically (cognitive academic language proficiency - CALP) in English. It has been postulated that BICS and CALP are two different sets of skills. Opponents of bilingual education claim that students with other primary languages besides Spanish are placed in Spanish classes rather than taught in their native languages and that many bilingual education programs fail to teach students English. Critics of bilingual education have claimed that studies supporting bilingual education tend to have poor methodologies and that there is little empirical support in favor of it. The controversy over bilingual education is often enmeshed in a larger political and cultural context. Opponents of bilingual education are sometimes accused of racism and xenophobia. This is especially so in the case of such groups as English First, which is a conservative organization that promotes the stance that English should be the official language of the United States. In Milwaukee, Wisconsin and other cities, Minister of education of the Young Lords, Tony Baez and others held marches and other activities to promote bilingual education. Proponents of bilingual education are frequently accused of practicing identity politics, to the detriment of children and of immigrants. :\\"To aid and monitor the education of English language learners (ELL)through mother- tongue and English education, the federal government enacted the Bilingual Education Act (Title V11) of the elementary and secondary Education Act in 1968. As an offshoot of president Lyndon B. Johnson's war on poverty, the act strove to help disenfranchised language-miniority students, especially Hispanics. Unfortunately, the acts aims were somewhat ambiguous. As Crawford (2000a) writes 'enacted at the apex of the Great Society, bilingual education act of 1968 passed congress without a single dissent. Americans have spent the past 30 years debating what it was meant to accomplish'.\\" (p. 107).Ovando, Carlos J. (2003). \\"Bilingual Education in the United States: Historical Development and Current Issues\\" (Bilingual Research Journal, 27(1), 1-24.) California California is the state with the highest number of English Learners (ELs) in the United States. One out of three students in California is an EL. In June 1998, Proposition 227 was passed by 61% of the California electorate. This proposition mandates that ELs be placed in structured English immersion for a period \\"not normally to exceed one year,\\" then be transferred to mainstream classrooms taught \\"overwhelmingly in English.\\"State of California This proposition also gave parents the possibility to request alternative programs for their children, however, the availability of waivers and information to parents have been a challenge in the implementation of this proposition.Parrish et al., (2002). \\"Proposition 227 and Instruction of English Learners in California: Evaluation Update\\" (U.S. Department of Education) In 2000, the California Department of Education contracted with the American Institutes for Research (AIR) and WestEd to conduct a five-year evaluation of the effects of Proposition 227. The study methodology focused on \\"A combination of student achievement analysis, phone interviews, case study site visits, and written surveys was used to examine such questions as how the proposition was implemented, which EL services are most and least effective, and what unintended consequences resulted from Proposition 227's implementation.\\" The authors caution about the limitations in the statewide data. California does not have the capacity to link student academic progress over time across years; however, using student-level linked data over time from the Los Angeles Unified School District, and complementing that analysis with surveys, site visits and interviews, the study found \\"no conclusive evidence favoring one instructional program over another.\\" Students who remained in bilingual education have similar academic growth trajectories when compared with students who switched to English Immersion. California, among other states, also has many public schools that have Immersion programs, most commonly Spanish/English Immersion but also including other languages. Immersion programs include native speakers of both languages and include instruction in both languages, with primary (grade) schools typically having 90% instruction in the minority language in the early grades, transitioning to 50% instruction in each of the minority language and English in the upper grades. Proposition 227 has been repealed in 2016 by California Proposition 58 (2016). Arizona California was followed by Arizona in the passage of similar legislation, Arizona Proposition 203, which ended several programs previously available to ESL students. Arizona was the first state to provide bilingual education in the 1960s. Georgia During the 1990s the state of Georgia increased its foreign-born population by 233%. That was the second- largest increase in the country, and Georgia is the sixth fastest-growing state in the United States. Georgia has the seventh-largest illegal immigrant population in the country; in the 2000 census 228,000 illegal immigrants lived in the state. During the 1980s and 1990s a labor shortage in the carpet industry contributed to a rapid increase in the Hispanic population of Whitfield County and surrounding areas. Today about 75% of the students in the Dalton (the hub of Whitfield County) public schools are Hispanic. Erwin Mitchell, a local Dalton lawyer, founded the Georgia Project in 1996 to help teach the influx of Hispanic students who have moved into the Dalton public schools. The Georgia Project partners with the University of Monterrey in Monterrey, Mexico to bring teachers from Mexico to Georgia Schools. Sixty teachers from the University of Monterrey have taught in Georgia since 1997, and they typically teach for two to three years on H-1B visas. The Georgia Project also has a Summer Institute that trains American teachers to speak Spanish and learn about Mexican culture. The Georgia Project is a bilingual/bicultural program that is primarily funded from federal education appropriations. Native American Reservations Following similar First Nations' models to Canada, academic linguists throughout the United States are working closely with Native American reservations communities to establish immersion and second-language programs for a number of respective tribal languages including Navajo, Hopi, Cherokee, Ojibwe, Lakhota, and Sioux, among others. Due to the combination of often a violent and isolative relationship between European settlers and Native Americans, their languages and communities have suffered dramatically in terms of facing extreme endangerment or extinction. The success of these programmes is mixed, depending largely on how healthy the status of the language in question is. However, English-medium education still remains most widely used. Native programs often suffer a lack of state support in terms of funding or encouragement due in large part to the strong preference towards a melting-pot society. Native American boarding schools, which enforced white American values and the English language were extensively used as late as the 1990s, and were notorious for implementing corporal punishment if a Native child was caught speaking his or her language or freely practicing their tribal faith. In order to maintain the Native American language diversity, bilingual education institutions were established to retrieve the speaker population of specific languages. One of the successful cases is Cheyenne language. In the early 1970s, when federal Title VII programs, a bilingual education project, were introduced on Montana reservations, the number of Northern Cheyenne language speakers increased dramatically. In Busby, Montana., the pride of Native American students was primarily stimulated. Native American students learning under such a bilingual system became willing to speak Cheyenne language in daily life and even developed a high English level. As a result, the bilingual education programs in Montana received almost 100 percent support' on the reservation.\\"The Special Case of Bilingual Education for Indian Students\\" ( April 1, 1987, James Crawford) =Guatemala= South America =Argentina= There are many English-Spanish schools in Argentina. Several of them are in the provinces where the Irish who were part of the local Elite used to live. While medium to big sized cities are likely to have several bilingual schools, bilingual education remains an exception rather than the norm and is generally reserved for the upper classes. There is not a nationally encompassing bilingual program available for public schools. Because of the ties that have historically bound private education to religious institutions, many of the bilingual schools in the country are Roman Catholic schools. For example, out of the three available bilingual schools in a medium-sized city such as Mar del Plata, two of them (Holy Mary of Northern Hills and Holy Trinity College) are practicing Roman Catholic schools.

The institution serves individuals afflicted by conditions related to Agent Orange while also opening channels of cross-cultural dialogue.https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/health/article/1153160/vietnamese- school-trains-disabled-victims-agent-orange  Early life  Born into a working class family on October 21, 1945 in Waltham, Massachusetts, George was the son of a Blackfoot Sioux father and Irish-American mother. Before contracting Lou Gehrig's disease, his father worked for Raytheon, a U.S. defense contractor. In Autumn of 1963, George joined the U.S. Army, where he served until 1966. After the end of his first stint in the army, and due to the growing effort in Vietnam, Mizo chose to re-enlist with the intent of serving in the conflict.  Activism  While recuperating in a Seattle military hospital, Mizo learned that his entire platoon had fallen in the Tet Offensive. After receiving this information, Mizo broke with the U.S. Army. Opting not to return to the war, he was court martialed and served two and a half years in prison before ultimately receiving a dishonorable discharge. In 1986, Mizo joined fellow war veterans Charles Liteky, S. Brian Wilson, and Duncan Murphy in the Veterans Fast for Life. Advocating for change in U.S. policy in Latin America, the group fasted on the steps of the United States Capitol for 46 days and renounced the medals they received for their prior military service. When their fast came to a close on October 10th, The New York Times described Mizo as ″...closer to death. He [George Mizo] has lost 45 pounds, 25 percent of his body weight. And because of a respiratory infection, he says, the doctor has told him he will slip away in five or six days. His muscles are contracting as they atrophy, and at night, he said, I wake up with agonizing cramps all up and down my legs.″ One month after their fast, the Iran-Contra Scandal broke.  Vietnam Friendship Village  Following the Veterans Fast for Life and revelations regarding the harmful effects of Agent Orange on veterans of all sides of the war, Mizo turned to reconciliation in Vietnam. Originally planning to construct a peace pagoda, Mizo instead began work on the Vietnam Friendship Village. The village now accommodates upwards of 120 individuals offering residency, education, vocational training, and physical therapy. In addition to their work with children, the Friendship Village also works directly with veterans, offering health services, education, and opportunities for cross-cultural dialogue. Today, the Vietnam Friendship Village is supported by a global network of donors and volunteers. Numerous fundraising committees for the village exist throughout the world, including, the United States, Vietnam, Germany, and France. The organization draws on this international support to fund projects and day-to-day operations of the main residency in Hanoi, Vietnam.  In media  George Mizo has been featured in a number of stories on anti-war activism and the aftermath of the Vietnam War. At the end of their fast on the steps of the Capitol building, Mizo and his fellow protestors appeared on the Phil Donahue Show to discuss their activism. As part of a story on the peaceful collaboration between the United States and Vietnam, PBS interviewed a supporter of the village project and Mizo's vision of reconciliation. George Mizo and the Vietnam Friendship Village were the focus of Michelle Mason's award-winning documentary, \\"The Friendship Village,\\" which outlines Mizo's story, the process that led to the creation of the village, and the vision and potential of the project. Mizo and The Friendship Village were also a focus of Matthias Leupold's documentary, \\"Lighter than Orange.\\"  Personal life  Mizo met his wife, Rosemarie Höhn- Mizo, during a German peace march in 1986. Later that year, she joined him in Washington, DC to support his fast. Following the fast, George and Rosemarie returned to Germany where she gave birth to their son, Michael. Today, Rosemarie is the head of the German Friendship Village Committee. On March 18th, 2002, George Mizo passed away from complications related to Agent Orange.

Aleksei was born in a Russian noble family in Ekaterinburg and grew up in Montreux, Switzerland, educated by private tutors. The family moved to Moscow just before World War I and he went to study at the State University of Moscow. An interest in natural history led to work at the university herbarium and then at the zoological museum. He took an interest in the cicadas but the October revolution of 1917 and his wealthy background meant that he could not join university. He however attended some classes informally and studied painting. In 1926 he joined the Central Asian Institute of Plant Protection as an assistant and travelled on several expeditions. Among his discoveries were of hypermetamorphosis in the Meloidae and Bombyliidae. His last publication under the name of Jasykov was published in 1931. After being held hostage by counter-revolutionaries during an expedition and losing his identification papers, he took on the name of step-father and subsequently published under the name of Zachvatkin. He moved to the All Union Institute of Plant Protection, Leningrad and then moved in 1933 to the entomological laboratory of the State University of Moscow. He studied Tyroglyphidae (Acarina) and obtained a Ph.D. in 1935 and a Doctor of Biological Sciences in 1939. He then became a professor of entomology at Moscow. His work on mites led him to propose in 1952, based on the development of the fourth pair of legs, the classification of the Acarina into Acariformes, Parasitiformes, and Opiliocarina.

The shared universe, much like the original Marvel Universe in comic books, was established by crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters. Central characters  The film series of the Marvel Cinematic Universe features many central characters across its phases. The first three phases are known as \\"The Infinity Saga\\". , 23 films have been released. Phase One is centered on six individuals who became the Avengers (Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Thor, Bruce Banner, Natasha Romanoff, Clint Barton) along with Nick Fury, leader of S.H.I.E.L.D., who is responsible for the idea to set up the team. Another central character is Loki, the primary antagonist in The Avengers (2012), a villain who was originally responsible for the Avengers to form to thwart his plans of world domination. Phase Two centers on the original Avengers and Fury once again, along with new additions of the team (James Rhodes [as seen in Phase One], Sam Wilson, Wanda Maximoff, and Vision). This Phase also introduces the Guardians of the Galaxy (Peter Quill, Gamora, Rocket, Groot and Drax), and Scott Lang. Phase Three brings back every central character of both Phase One and Phase Two. It starts off focusing on the division of the original Avengers (as shown before on the early Phases) with newly added superheroes like Bucky Barnes (first shown in Phase One and Phase Two), Scott Lang, T'Challa and Peter Parker being involved. Nick Fury's origin is revealed and Loki has more of a major neutral role around Phase Three. Thanos (who was briefly shown in Phase One and Phase Two) fills the role as the major recurring villain of the third Phase. Hope van Dyne (as shown in Phase Two) joins with Scott Lang as duo superhero partners. Stephen Strange and Wong are also introduced as members of the new formation of the Masters of the Mystical Arts which sides with the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy to defeat Thanos. The Guardians of the Galaxy gets new members with Mantis and Nebula (who was originally a villain in Phase Two but later redeems herself). Female characters are also brought more on-screen throughout the Phase especially with the final Avengers: Endgame ending which adds Tony's love interest (from both Phases before), Pepper Potts, ladies from Wakanda such as Okoye and Shuri and the female from Asgard, Valkyrie, along with the newest headlined character of Phase Three, Carol Danvers, to name a few. =Tony Stark / Iron Man= Anthony Edward \\"Tony\\" Stark (portrayed by Robert Downey Jr.) is based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name and commonly known by his alter ego, Iron Man. Stark was created by Stan Lee, Larry Lieber, Don Heck and Jack Kirby, and first appeared in the MCU in the film Iron Man. In the films, Stark is an industrialist, genius inventor, hero and former playboy who is CEO of Stark Industries. At the beginning of the film series, he is a chief weapons manufacturer for the U.S. military, until he has a change of heart and redirects his technical knowledge into the creation of mechanized suits of armor which he uses to defend against those that would threaten peace around the world.

The lineup that was depicted by Joss Whedon is primarily based on the Ultimates of Ultimate Marvel, with the exception of two classic founders, Giant-Man and the Wasp. According to Whedon the theme behind the lineup is : \\"There's a thunder god, there's a green 'id' giant rage monster, there's Captain America from the 40s, there's Tony Stark who definitely doesn't get along with anybody. Ultimately these people don't belong together and the whole movie is about finding yourself from community. And finding that you not only belong together but you need each other, very much. According to film critic Peter Travers, \\"Whedon is exploring richer ground\\" with the theme. \\"He sees the Avengers as the ultimate dysfunctional family. Their powers have estranged them from the normal world. As a result, they're lonely, cranky, emotional fuck-ups, which the actors have a ball playing.\\" The lineup of the first movie reprised their role in Avengers: Age of Ultron along with new additions and allies written and directed by Whedon again in May 2015. At the end of Age of Ultron, a new roster of Avengers is established. The new Avengers roster appears in Captain America: Civil War, directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and released on May 6, 2016.

She is known for work at the intersection of fine art, social justice, and emerging technologies such as virtual reality and augmented reality.  Early Life and education  Baker Cahill was born in Cambridge, MA. She received her B.A. with Honors in Art from Williams College in 1992. She launched her art career in 2007.  Work  Baker Cahill works in graphite, paint, sculpture, video, virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR). She is the Founder and Creative Director of the 4th Wall public art app. Her work explores themes related to the human body as a site of ongoing struggle and resistance, “[dissecting] notions of power moving over and through the body.” One series, Bullet Blossoms, involved Baker Cahill shooting her paintings with bullets. Exhibition highlights include the site-specific 2019 Desert X Biennial in the Coachella Valley. Baker Cahill generated large scale, animated drawings in AR for the Salton Sea and above the wind farms in the Coachella Valley. She had a solo exhibition at Boston Cyberarts, an AR public art exhibition at the Boston Greenway, a VR public art project on the Sunset Digital Billboards sponsored by Innovation Foundation, a VR/AR event at Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions (LACE), and an immersive solo exhibition at the Pasadena Museum of California Art. Baker Cahill is the recipient of a 2012 ARC Grant from the Center for Cultural Innovation, was a 2019 nominee for the Rema Hort Mann Emerging Artist Grant, and received an \\"Impact Maker to Watch\\" award at LA City Hall. She was the subject of a 2019 Bloomberg Media Studios \\"Art+Technology\\" short documentary. Baker Cahill is an international public speaker. She was a featured 2018 TEDx speaker in Pasadena, CA and delivered a keynote at Games for Change in New York City, NY. In 2020, the Berggruen Institute announced that Baker Cahill would be one of its ten inaugural Artist Fellows in its Transformations of the Human program. = Liberty Bell = On July 4, 2020, Baker Cahill launched \\"Liberty Bell,\\" an augmented reality public art installation in partnership with Art Production Fund, Jamaica Bay-Rockaway Parks Conservancy, and Rockaway Artists Alliance. \\"Liberty Bell\\" featured site-specific artwork in six locations across the Eastern United States: the site of the Boston Tea Party revolt in Boston; Fort Sumter in Charleston; the “Rocky Steps” leading to the Philadelphia Museum of Art; Fort Tilden, the U.S. Army installation in Rockaway, Queens, NY; the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, where the “Bloody Sunday” attack took place in 1965; and the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C. According to The New York Times, the project took \\"fifteen months\\" to develop and sites were chosen \\"where American history is still being interpreted, its Constitution tested and its identities forged.\\" The AR installations are accessible for free through the 4th Wall App, and will remain available for a year following July 4, 2020. In an interview with Artnet, Baker Cahill explained that the visual aesthetic of \\"Liberty Bell,\\" \\"an animated coil of red, white, and blue brushstrokes roughly in the shape of that famed artifact that seems to float in the air,\\" was intended to question, \\"how the very concept of liberty was flawed from the beginning. It was available to a select group of people and not others.... You can’t talk about liberty without actively and rigorously engaging the history of slavery.” Smithsonian Magazine called \\"Liberty Bell\\" \\"ambitious\\" and notable for its timeliness, writing, \\"['Liberty Bell'] debuts at a unique point in American history, when communities are reckoning with the racist legacies of historical monuments across the country and, in many cases, taking them down.\\" In a partnership announcement regarding the Washington D.C. installation of \\"Liberty Bell,\\" the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden wrote that, \\"As 'Liberty Bell' sways above the pool, AR shadows will be cast over the water. The image will create a literal and metaphorical reflective experience for viewers as they are invited to question the very concept of liberty.”  4th Wall augmented reality app  In 2018, Baker Cahill founded the 4th Wall public art app with developer Drive Studios. 4th Wall is the AR platform through which Baker Cahill exhibits her own 3D drawings as well as curates public art exhibitions in AR. Curate LA referred to 4th Wall as, \\"a tool of public engagement and subversive social practice, [offering] a virtual space for fellow artists and collaborators: sites of cultural, historical, or political significance use geolocation information to reveal untold stories or conceptual ideas.\\" The first version of the app featured Baker Cahill's studio in 360 and a hologram of herself talking about the conceptual foundation of her work. The 4th Wall app includes “Coordinates,” a series of curated and site-specific public art exhibitions in AR.  Social justice and activism  Baker Cahill's work as an artist and curator have been noted for an emphasis on social justice, collaboration, and activism, with the LA Times calling her work \\"unapologetically political.\\" From 2010–2012, Baker Cahill led a collaborative art project at Homeboy Industries called \\"Exit Wounds.\\" It involved a creative process in which participants from Homeboy Industries told \\"their stories through their own photographs, original art, text and other objects. Once the works were created they were then shot at with a .45 caliber handgun by Baker Cahill. Using mixed media, these personal narratives revolve around violence, loss and the hope for a future.\\" Works from this project were exhibited throughout Los Angeles as part of the Craft Contemporary (formerly CAFAM)’s “Folk Art Everywhere” program. Baker Cahill has also used the 4th Wall app as a platform for site-specific public art in augmented reality. = Coordinates = Using the 4th Wall app, Baker Cahill initiated “Coordinates,\\" an ongoing series of global, collaborative, curated & geo-located thematic AR public art exhibitions. Among the first participating Coordinates artists were artists Beatriz Cortez, Micol Hebron, Tanya Aguiñiga and Shizu Saldamando. = Defining Line = In November 2018, Baker Cahill co-curated “Defining Line” along the Los Angeles River with the artist Debra Scacco, in which augmented reality artworks were \\"placed at distinct points along the L.A. River, the works deal with urban redevelopment, environmental issues, untold Native histories and patterns of gentrification.\\" = Battlegrounds = In October 2019, Baker Cahill co-curated “Battlegrounds” with Jesse Damiani. The citywide exhibition focused on contested sites in New Orleans, LA, featuring 30 artworks in augmented reality from 24 artists, including Dawn DeDeaux and Keith Calhoun and Chandra McCormick. In an interview with the LA Times, Baker Cahill called \\"Battlegrounds\\" a \\"reclamation of history,\\" explaining that \\"every artist in this show, whether it's quietly and poetically or more outspoken, are engaging directly with their community, with their environment, with their history, their own lived experience.\\" = In Plain Sight = The 4th Wall app was the augmented reality platform used for the In Plain Sight project, which featured both real and augmented reality skywriting located over U.S. detention centers from 80 different artists. According to The New York Times, the texts consisted of \\"messages of solidarity and defiance typed in the sky to highlight the plight of immigrants held in detention centers.\\" The use of augmented reality allowed In Plain Sight to \\"continue to exist in myriad forms after the last clouds of vapor have evaporated.\\"  External links  * State of the Art (May 17, 2018) * Voices of VR with Kent Bye (July 2, 2019) * Everything VR & AR (July 25, 2019)  Grants and awards  2020: Fellow, Berggruen Institute, Santa Monica, CA 2019: Artist in Residence, Facebook, Los Angeles, CA 2019: Honoree, Fulcrum Arts Benefit, 2019 2019: Official Selection, Games for Change Immersive Arcade 2019: Nominee for Rema Hort Mann Emerging Artist Grant, 2019 2019: Impact Maker to Watch 2019, Stratiscope, City Hall, Los Angeles, CA 2014: Herradura Art Competition, Los Angeles 2nd Place 2014 2012: ARC Grant from the Center for Cultural Innovation  References  Category:Living people Category:1970 births Category:21st- century American women artists Category:Williams College alumni Category:American social justice activists Category:Artists from Los Angeles Category:Political artists Category:Virtual reality Category:Augmented reality Category:Artists from Cambridge, Massachusetts Category:21st-century American artists ","title":"Nancy Baker Cahill"},{"id":"62372658","text":"Thagu byin (; ; also spelt thagu pyin) is a traditional Burmese snack or mont.

Protesters initially set-up a roadblock at the entrance of Cross- Harbour Tunnel, close to the university, and took the university as the base to defend it from attacks by the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) given the conflict at Chinese University of Hong Kong days earlier. Some citizens attempted to remove the roadblocks but were stopped by the protesters. The police shot tear gas and used water cannons to shower the protesters with water containing blue colouring mixed with chemical irritants. The protesters responded by throwing bricks and petrol bombs. Thereafter, the police blocked different campus exits and forbade protesters from leaving. Police tried to drive an armoured vehicle into campus but the vehicle was hit by petrol bombs, forcing it to reverse. The police arrested people who claimed to be first-aid personnel, medical service volunteers and reporters. On 18 November the police shot 1,458 canisters of tear gas at protesters as well as 1,391 rubber bullets, 325 bean bag rounds, and 256 sponge grenades. On 19 November the city's hospitals were overwhelmed by the number of protesters needing urgent medical attention caused by the siege, and advised citizens not to use emergency rooms unless absolutely necessary.  17 November  At around 10:00 am, some citizens attempted to clear the roadblocks between Austin Road and Chatham Road South, near Rosary Church. During their attempt to remove the obstacles in the road, protesters blocked their actions and prevented them from dismantling the roadblocks. During the confrontation, bricks were thrown towards the people clearing the obstacles. Riot police arrived at around 11:00 and confronted the protesters, firing tear gas and rubber bullets at them. The protesters responded by throwing bricks and petrol bombs. In the afternoon, the situation became worse. Two water cannons and the armored cars were there to breach the protesters' line. The blue-dyed water fired from the water cannons continuously and the protesters fought back with bricks and petrol bombs. Around 9:00 pm, police publicly announced that anyone arrested inside Polytechnic University would face the charge of rioting, as would anyone who attempted to go in or help people inside. The police added that anyone inside the campus could peacefully leave via the exit at Y-core. However, those attempting to leave via the designated exit were instead arrested. Among the people arrested were university staff, reporters, social workers, volunteer first-aid personnel, doctors and nurses. Police claimed that protesters were disguising themselves as medical workers. Dr Arisina Ma, president of Hong Kong Public Doctors’ Association, criticised the police for arresting and detaining them for 24 hours and then forcing them to post bail instead of simply checking their professional identification and releasing them. Surgeon Darren Mann, who had witnessed medics being hogtied and who had telephoned both the Red Cross and Médecins Sans Frontières asking them to intervene, criticised the police for treating medical personnel like terrorists, stating: \\"The arrest of [active medical] personnel is almost unheard of in civilised countries and is incompatible with the compact of humanitarianism\\". Polytechnic University authorities released a statement saying that protesters had damaged its laboratories and stolen dangerous chemicals. Subsequently, safety concerns mounted as the Chinese University, Polytechnic University, and City University also reported to police that chemicals – several of which are toxic, corrosive, or flammable, and deadly – had been stolen from their laboratories.

Afterwards, pro-democracy legislators held a press conference and declared there was a severe humanitarian crisis happening inside Polytechnic University and demanded Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam speak up and end the crisis immediately to avoid any serious consequences. At 9:00 am, an RTHK reporter preparing to relieve a colleague inside in accordance with procedures predetermined by the police went to the indicated place for swapping out. Riot police shouted at the journalist and ordered him to put his hands up while they checked his press ID and identity card. When the reporter claimed that he only wanted to go on duty, riot police refused to let him out and insisted that he had to leave by another route. He was escorted by the police as he was leaving. Other reporters of RTHK who passed the Cross-Harbour Tunnel and wanted to document the events unfolding at PolyU were likewise blocked and ordered to leave by the riot police. The police indicated that everyone inside PolyU would be charged with \\"participating in a riot\\". At 11:00 am, the police fired tear gas towards Queen Elizabeth Hospital which injured some protesters and forced the hospital to suspend specialist services and to use plastic tape to seal its windows and doors.

Responses  = Polytechnic University = Teng Jin-guang, president of Polytechnic University, released a video early on 18 November to explain his disappearance and asked protesters to leave peacefully. In a video lasting 1:08 released by the Polytechnic University's Public Relations Department, he claimed that he had been communicating with police since the afternoon of 17 November and because the police did not suggest he go to the campus, he decided not to appear at the campus but instead release the video. He further claimed that police promised a temporary suspension on the use of force on condition the protesters will do the same. He also said police promised him that protesters could leave the campus peacefully and he himself would accompany any student to the police station and ensure their case will be fairly processed. Teng said that the government shall bear overall responsibility and claimed the university was a victim since only around 50 radical protesters were students from the university. = People's Republic of China = Hu Xijin, the chief editor of Global Times, a Chinese state-owned tabloid, urged for protesters to be shot and advocated for immunity from charges for the police in the case of a fatal shooting. = United States = Jim McGovern, a member of the United States House of Representatives, stated that the entire world was monitoring the situation in Hong Kong, that further violence would only worsen the situation, and asked for self-control by the Hong Kong Government. = United Kingdom = Malcolm Rifkind, former UK Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, urged Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam to order the police not to use live ammunition.

It is part of the Spearhead Range, which is a subset of the Garibaldi Ranges. It is situated southeast of Whistler, and west-northwest of Tremor Mountain, which is the highest point in the Spearhead Range. Precipitation runoff from the south side of the peak drains into Fitzsimmons Creek which is a tributary of the Cheakamus River, and meltwater from the Decker Glacier on the northeastern slope drains to Wedge Creek. Decker Mountain is often climbed as part of the Spearhead Traverse. The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1954 by a party from the Varsity Outdoor Club of the University of British Columbia. The descriptive name for the mountain refers to its two-decked layer form and flat, deck-like top, while the suffix \\"er\\" was used for purposes of euphony. The mountain's name was officially adopted on August 27, 1965, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada as submitted by Dick Culbert, author of Climber's Guide to the Coastal Ranges of British Columbia. Climate Based on the Köppen climate classification, Decker Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Decker Mountain.

He served a life appointment as the Poet Laureate of Virginia from 1970 to 1991. His novels include The Writhen Wood, Cloud Above Clocktime, and To Love that Well.  Biography  Guy Carleton Drewry was born in Stevensburg, Virginia on May 21, 1901.The National Archives in St. Louis, Missouri; St. Louis, Missouri; WWII Draft Registration Cards for Virginia, 10/16/1940-03/31/1947; Record Group: Records of the Selective Service System, 147; Box: 213 He was the son of a Methodist circuit minister, causing him to spend much of his childhood moving around.A Life of Poetry: Carelton Drewry Looks Back at the Words that Flowed So.” The Roanoke Times, 10 Feb. 1991. He had no formal education due to this, learning to read from his sister and practicing poetry through hymnals. Drewry first began writing on his own at the age of 18, not publishing any work until later in his career. In 1922, Drewry began working as a railroad statistician for Norfolk & Western Railway through a friend's recommendation. He later admitted he did not like this position, but it paid the bills so he could continue writing.“Guy Carleton Drewry Dies; Was Virginia's Poet Laureate.” The Washington Post, 6 Aug. 1991. It was around this time he began frequenting the Roanoke Public Library, which gave him his first consistent source of books. In 1923, Drewry sold his first work to a magazine called The Dial. In addition, he served as the associate editor of The Lyric (magazine) from 1929 to 1939. Drewry continued writing for various magazines, including Virginia Quarterly Review, The New York Times, and The Nation. Drewry's first novel Proud Horns was published in 1933. This was followed by Sounding Summer in 1948, Time of Turning in 1951, The Writhen Wood in 1953, and Cloud Above Clocktime in 1957. Drewry was married on April 2, 1942 to Margaret Elizabeth McDonald.Virginia Department of Health; Richmond, Virginia; Virginia, Marriages, 1936-2014; Roll: 101168125 The two had two children, a daughter, Barbara Louise Anderson, and a son, Guy Carleton ″David″ Drewry Jr. In 1966, he retired from his statistician position, devoting his time to poetry. He then served as President of the Virginia Poet Society as well as a Regional Vice President of the Poetry Society of America. In 1970, the Virginia General Assembly named Drewry Virginia's Poet Laureate for life. Drewry published his final novel To Love That Well in 1975, which was a compilation of poems in past novels and publications. Drewry passed away due to pneumonia and congestive heart failure on August 3, 1991Virginia Department of Health; Richmond, Virginia; Virginia Deaths, 1912-2014  Works  Drewry's themes are usually existentialist, focusing on the passage of time, death, and the natural world. His poems rely heavily on the usage of imagery to deliver his messages. Drewry often takes a position of authority in his poems, attempting to explain to the reader how the world operates. = Books = * Proud Horns (1933) * Sounding Summer (1948) * Time of Turning (1951) * The Writhen Wood (1953) * Cloud Above Clocktime (1957) * To Love That Well (1975)  Awards  * 1953 Poetry Awards Foundation Prize for \\"Best Volume of Poems in English\\" for A Time for Turning * Keats Memorial Lyric Prize  References  Category:1901 births Category:1991 deaths ","title":"Guy Carleton Drewry"},{"id":"62372869","text":"Courtney Alice Shayne is a fictional character who appears in the 1999 film Jawbreaker, portrayed by actress Rose McGowan. Storyline Courtney Shayne is the manipulative, cruel and vindictive leader of an all-female quartet in Reagan High School. Together with two other friends, she kidnaps her rival, Elizabeth \\"Liz\\" Purr, as a prank. Courtney stuffs a jawbreaker into her mouth, gags her, and puts her into the trunk of a car. Later, the girls open the trunk and discover Liz is dead, having choked to death on the jawbreaker. Liz's best friend, Julie, wants to go to the police, but Courtney forbids her. Courtney spins an endless web of lies to cover up the murder and maintain her popularity. When Julie breaks away from the clique, she becomes a target for abuse and contempt throughout the school. Julie discovers, however, a recording in which Courtney admits to killing Liz, and the truth is made public just as Courtney is crowned prom queen. This angers the entire student body, who gang up and turn her in to the authorities, blocking any paths of escape. Characterization The narrator describes Courtney as \\"like Satan in heels\\". Anne Cohen calls her a \\"porcelain-skinned demon who rules the fictional Reagan High with soul-crushing terror.\\" Kathleen Sweeney suggests that 1999 \\"gave viewers two manipulative dark-haired Queen Bees\\": Kathryn Merteuil in Cruel Intentions and Courtney Shayne in Jawbreaker.

In addition, the Greater Milwaukee Area has over 60% self-identified German-Americans. History Most German immigrants came to Wisconsin in search of inexpensive farmland.Conzen, Kathleen Neils. Immigrant Milwaukee, 1836–1860. Cambridge, Massachusetts and London, England: Harvard University Press, 1976. However, immigration began to change in character and size in the late 1840s and early 1850s, due to the 1848 revolutionary movements in Europe.Conzen, Kathleen Neils. The German Athens' Milwaukee and the Accommodation of Its Immigrants 1836–1860.\\" PhD diss., vol. 1, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1972. After 1848, hopes for a united Germany had failed, and revolutionary and radical Germans, known as the \\"Forty-Eighters\\", turned their attention to the United States. Milwaukee began to grow as a city as high numbers of immigrants, mainly German, made their way to Wisconsin during the 1840s and 1850s. Scholars classify German immigration to the United States in three major waves, and Wisconsin received a significant number of immigrants from all three. The first wave from 1845 to 1855 consisted mainly of people from Southwestern Germany, the second wave from 1865 to 1873 was mainly from Northwestern Germany, while the third wave from 1880 to 1893 came from Northeastern Germany.Bungert, Heike, Cora Lee Kluge and Robert C. Ostergren. Wisconsin German Land and Life. Madison: Max Kade Institute for German-American Studies, 2006. In the 1840s, the number of people who left German-speaking lands was 385,434, it reached 976,072 in the 1850s, and an all-time high of 1.4 million immigrated in the 1880s. In 1890, the 2.78 million first-generation German Americans represented the second-largest foreign-born group in the United States. Of all those who left the German lands between 1835 and 1910, 90 percent went to the United States, most of them traveling to the Mid-Atlantic states and the Midwest. Many Germans chose Milwaukee due to its geographic position on Lake Michigan's west coast. It eventually became known as \\"the German Athens\\" (German: Die deutsche Athen). Radical Germans trained in politics in the old country dominated the city's Socialists political scene. Skilled workers dominated many crafts, while entrepreneurs created the brewing industry; the most famous brands included Pabst, Schlitz, Miller, and Blatz.Trudy Knauss Paradis, et al. German Milwaukee (2006) Demographics Germans in Milwaukee today Milwaukee and its suburbs have many festivals devoted to its German heritage and history including Oktoberfest and German Fest. The genesis of German Fest occurred when Mayor Henry Maier challenged the local German-American community during a speech on May 20, 1980, at the 20th Anniversary of the German American National Congress (DANK) to organize a German festival. Both MLB's Milwaukee Brewers and its minor league forerunner were inspired in large part by Milwaukee's beer brewing heritage. Milwaukee boasts a number of German restaurants, as well as a traditional German beer hall. A German language immersion school is offered for children in grades K-5. Germans were, and still are, an important component of life in Wisconsin and Milwaukee.

Historically it was the main road between Johannesburg and Pretoria, it now runs along through the central and north-eastern parts of the city from Bassonia, passing through Johannesburg CBD and Hillbrow, passing through numerous older suburbs, including Houghton and Orange Grove and the Alexandra Township as Louis Botha Avenue, before it becomes the (R101) Old Pretoria Road and continues to Midrand and Pretoria. Route The M11 begins in the suburb of Bassonia (east of Glenvista) at a junction with the M95 Bellairs Road. It goes north through the suburb of Bassonia as Comaro Street to reach a junction with the N12 Highway (Johannesburg Southern Bypass, Johannesburg Ring Road). Just after the N12, it enters the suburb of Oakdene as Oak Avenue and proceeds northwards to enter the suburb of Rosettenville as Prairie Street (Meeting the M38 South Rand Road just after Oakdene and meeting the M34 Geranium Street by Rosettenville Junction Shopping Centre). After meeting the M34, it is named Diagonal Street and proceeds northwards. After bypassing the Regents Park Estate, it becomes Wemmer Pan Road and makes a loop around the Wemmer Pan to meet the western end of the N17 Highway just east of the Springfield Suburb. From the N17 junction, the M11 continues northwards to meet the M2 Highway (Francois Oberholzer Freeway) (westbound only) as Mooi Street and enter the City and Suburban Area of Johannesburg. As Mooi Street becomes a one-way street at its junction with the R29 Road (Marshall Street), the M11 joins the R29 westwards up to the junction with Von Wielligh Street in the suburb of Marshalltown, where the M11 resumes going northwards. Soon after, the M11 meets the two roads that form the R24 Road (Albertina Sisulu Road and Commissioner Street). By Lillian Ngoyi Street near the MTN North Taxi Rank, the M11 becomes Klein Street and continues northwards to pass through Joubert Park, where the Johannesburg Art Gallery is located. At the junction with Smit Street (M10 Road) (east of Johannesburg Park Station and east of Braamfontein), the M11 joins the M10 eastwards up to the next junction, where it enters the suburb of Hillbrow, returns to facing northwards and resumes being called Klein Street. By Hillbrow Police Station, it becomes Clarendon Place (forming the border between the Parktown and Berea suburbs), meeting the eastern end of Empire Road (M71 Road), before becoming Willie Street. At the Houghton Drive (M31 Road) off-ramp, the M11 becomes Louis Botha Avenue. The M11 proceeds as Louis Botha Avenue, heading north-east, separating Houghton to the north from Yeoville and Bellevue to the south. In Houghton, it passes close to the private boy's schools of St John's College (1889) and King Edward VII school (1911). After this point, the road curves and is ominously nicknamed Deathbend due to the number of car accidents at the spot. Here the M16 1st Avenue in Houghton intersects this route from the left at a t-junction and is briefly co-signed. The route then enters the suburb of Orange Grove passing the new Victory Theatre (2007). Midway through Orange Grove, the road bends northwards and the M16 splits off to the right as 8th Street. The M11 passes through Orchards and is intersected by the R25 and then passes Sydenham and smaller suburbs of Maryvale, Forbesdale, Cheltondale, Rouxville and Hawkins Estate. The road then crosses the M40 at Atholl Road in the suburbs of Highlands North and Waverly. The road later crosses the M30 Corlett Drive in Bramley before reaching, a short distance later, the M54 Artwright Avenue in the light industrial suburb of Wynberg with the old township of Alexandra close by. The road still designated the M11 continues now as the Pretoria Main Road reaching M60 Marlboro Drive intersection where the M1 De Villiers Graaff motorway can be accessed. Crossing the intersection the M11 continues north parallel to the M1 on the left as the Eastern Service Road before reaching its end at the intersection of the R55 Woodmead Drive at Woodlands. The road continues northwards as the R101 Old Pretoria Road to Midrand.

He is the author of more than 200 peer-reviewed publications, 9 books on topics in science, and 2 family memoirs.  Research accomplishments  = Membrane transport physiology = Conceptualization and mathematical modeling of how membrane channels, carriers and pumps work to transport molecules across the cell membrane. Stein was the first to propose a model of the cell membrane as a fluid, amphiphilic structure. He presented this idea at the Society of General Physiology meeting in 1968, where the chairman of the session said: \\"Let’s stop here and discuss this interesting new idea\\" .Stein WD. Intra-protein interactions across a fluid membrane as a model for biological transport. The Journal of general physiology 1969; 54(1): 81–90. doi:10.1085/jgp.54.1.81 Stein's model, however, was not as cogent as the fluid mosaic model some years later presented by Singer and Nicolson, who are credited with the idea in text-books.Singer SJ, Nicolson GL. The fluid mosaic model of the structure of cell membranes. Science. 1972; 175(4023): 720–31. Vereb G et al. Dynamic, yet structured: The cell membrane three decades after the Singer-Nicolson model. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2003; 100: 8053–8. The kinetic equations of membrane transport were developed by Stein, together with William Lieb, and published in “Transport and Diffusion Across Cell Membranes”, a comprehensive treatment of transport kinetics.Transport and Diffusion Across Cell Membranes by Wilfred D. Stein. Academic Press, January 1, 1986. = Na,K-pump (Na,K-ATPase) = In collaboration with Steven Karlish at the Weizmann Institute, Stein investigated the kinetic mechanism of active Na and K ion transport, confirming the basic alternating access model of active Na and K transport. Karlish SJ, Stein WD. Effects of ATP or phosphate on passive rubidium fluxes mediated by Na-K-ATPase reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles. J Physiol. 1982; 328: 317–31.

PubMed ; PubMed Central PMCID: PMC1193368. An important finding was that trapping or “occlusion” of the K and Na ions in the protein has the functional role of minimizing wasteful cation leakages through the system, thus ensuring optimal efficiency of energy coupling between ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) hydrolysis and active Na and K ion movements, 3 Na ions out of and 2 K ions into the cell per cycle, respectively. Stein WD, Lieb WR, Karlish SJ, Eilam Y. A model for active transport of sodium and potassium ions as mediated by a tetrameric enzyme. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1973 Jan;70(1):275–8. PubMed . Cation occlusion is now considered an essential property of all ATP-driven cation pumps and also other coupled cation transport systems (e.g. cation exchangers or co-transport proteins). = Flux of calcium across calcium-transporting cells = Stein collaborated with Felix Bronner, an authority on the physiology of calcium movements, in developing a model that could account for the rates of transmembrane movements of calcium in the face of the cell's extremely low concentrations of the ion. They postulated that the role of the cell's calcium-binding proteins was to raise effective calcium concentrations and thus provide the necessary high transcellular calcium fluxes.Bronner F, Stein WD. CaBPr Facilitates Intracellular Diffusion for Ca Pumping in Distal Convoluted Tubule. Am J Physiol 1998; 255(3): F558–62. DOI: 10.1152/ajprenal.1988.255.3.F558 = Coupling of salt/substrate and water transport in membrane proteins = As a visiting scientist at the University of Copenhagen in 1993, Stein worked with the Danish physiologist Thomas Zeuthen on the coupling of water and substrates in membrane proteins.Zeuthen T, Stein WD. Cotransport of salt and water in membrane proteins: membrane proteins as osmotic engines. J Membr Biol. 1994 Feb;137(3):179–95. Review. PubMed . They provided a conceptual framework for how a flux of substrates through a membrane protein can lead to a co-flux of water. Zeuthen & Stein suggested that the substrate-flux generates a hyperosmolar compartment within the protein, i.e. in the aqueous cavities abutting the outer solutions. As a result, water enters this compartment by osmosis and proceeds across the membrane. = ABC transporter kinetics = In collaboration with Thomas Litman, at the University of Copenhagen, Stein worked out the kinetics of the ABC transporter P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) based on transport and ATPase measurements. Litman T, Zeuthen T, Skovsgaard T, Stein WD. Structure-activity relationships of P-glycoprotein interacting drugs: kinetic characterization of their effects on ATPase activity.

Relation between the turnover number for vinblastine transport and for vinblastine-stimulated ATP hydrolysis by human P-glycoprotein. J Biol Chem 1997; 272: 21160–6. In further collaboration with Litman, and based on detailed kinetic measurements of drug accumulation in cell lines with different levels of the multidrug resistance transporter P-glycoprotein, Stein worked out a simple equation for the “leak-pump” mode of action of the drug efflux pump, P-glycoprotein.

Channel shift values as a function of valspodar (P-glycoprotein inhibitor) blood concentrations were fitted to a simple descending hyperbolic, Michaelis–Menten-type saturation curve, revealing that valspodar is a P-glycoprotein substrate, which is effluxed from the cells. Inhibition appears to plateau above a plasma level of 1000 ng/ml indicating that concentrations were typically in range for inhibition of P-glycoprotein in patient tumors.

PubMed . = Malaria transport kinetics = In collaboration with Michael Lanzer, Stein demonstrated that via mutations in the chloroquine resistance transporter (PfCRT), the antimalarial drug chloroquine is transported away from its target, the parasite's digestive vacuole, which does not occur via the wild- type form of PfCRT. Sanchez CP, Rotmann A, Stein WD, Lanzer M. Polymorphisms within PfMDR1 alter the substrate specificity for anti-malarial drugs in Plasmodium falciparum. Mol Microbiol. 2008 Nov;70(4):786–98. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2008.06413.x. Epub 2008 Aug 18. PubMed . They also demonstrated that PfCRT is able to transport diverse antimalarial drugs and that chloroquine and quinine compete for transport via PfCRT in a manner that is consistent with mixed-type inhibition. Bellanca S, Summers RL, Meyrath M, Dave A, Nash MN, Dittmer M, Sanchez CP, Stein WD, Martin RE, Lanzer M. Multiple drugs compete for transport via the Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter at distinct but interdependent sites. J Biol Chem. 2014 Dec 26;289(52):36336–51. PubMed . Other studies showed that PfMDR1 transports drugs, such as chloroquine and quinine, into the digestive vacuole and that mutations in this ABC-transporter reduce drug transport efficiency and, hence, contribute to drug resistance. Their kinetic studies further supported the hypothesis that drug transport via PfCRT and PfMDR1 can incur a fitness cost as these drugs compete with the natural substrate for transport. An important finding from the joint work with Lanzer, was that – based on transport kinetics – they showed the system is a co-transporter of chloroquine and protons.Sanchez CP1, Stein WD, Lanzer M. Is PfCRT a channel or a carrier? Two competing models explaining chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium falciparum. Trends Parasitol. 2007; 23: 332–9. In addition, work with the Lanzer group led to the identification of a candidate gene for quinine and quinidine resistance.Sanchez CP, Liu CH, Mayer S, Nurhasanah A, Cyrklaff M, Mu J, Ferdig MT, Stein WD, Lanzer M. A HECT Ubiquitin-Protein Ligase as a Novel Candidate Gene for Altered Quinine and Quinidine Responses in Plasmodium falciparum. PLoS Genet 2014; 10(5): e1004382. PMCID: PMC4022464. With his son Moshe Hoshen, together with Hoshen's doctoral supervisor, Hagai Ginsburg, Stein also carried out mathematical modeling of artemisinin treatment of malaria. Hoshen proposed a model in which artemisinin resistance is based on a dormancy stage during which the parasite waits out toxic concentrations of this antimalarial drug.Hoshen MB, Na-Bangchang K, Stein WD, Ginsburg H. Mathematical modelling of the chemotherapy of Plasmodium falciparum malaria with artesunate: postulation of 'dormancy', a partial cytostatic effect of the drug, and its implication for treatment regimens.

PubMed . Individual patient data including tumor measurements for most, PSA data for prostate cancer, CA19-9 data for pancreatic cancer, and M-spike measurements, are fit to Stein's series of equations developed and validated that allow determination of regression, d, or growth, g. A series of observations using these equations have been generated – that g correlates with survival, that g is stable while patients are on therapy, that g determines the tumor nadir rather than d, that g for an individual patient can be benchmarked against g for groups of patients, that g can often be determined in a higher fraction of patients on study than a progression endpoint, that g offers a continuous response assessment metric, and that median g for patients enrolled on a clinical trial can be compared across trials, or benchmarked against historical data. This work is poised for use by the pharmaceutical industry in drug development.

It has hosted Louisville City FC of the USL Championship since it opened in 2020 and will become home to Racing Louisville FC of the National Women's Soccer League in 2021. The venue has 11,700 permanent seats, with expansion for up to 15,304 spectators, and began construction in 2018. History =Planning and financing= Louisville City FC was founded in 2014 as the successor to Orlando City SC, which had moved to Major League Soccer (MLS) and left an open slot in USL Pro (later the USL Championship). The team began play in 2015 at Louisville Slugger Field, a minor league baseball park, but expressed interest in building a soccer-specific stadium after reaching attendance goals. As part of the shared five-year arrangement at Slugger Field, Louisville City FC paid for minor renovations, including a retractable pitchers mound, and a rental fee of $5,000 per match. The new team drew an average attendance of over 6,000 per match in their inaugural season, second among teams in the USL, but were unable to generate revenue as a secondary tenant at Slugger Field, which incurred unexpected expenses. In August 2015, high-level talks with Mayor Greg Fischer concerning stadium planning began as the club also explored bidding for an MLS franchise. Louisville City FC owner Wayne Estopinal and Metro Councilman Dan Johnson proposed a site at Champions Park, a former country club northeast of downtown, for a stadium that would initially seat 10,000 spectators and expand to 20,000 for an MLS team. The city government announced a stadium feasibility and financing study in January 2016, examining four sites in Louisville. The study was completed in August and recommended a 10,000-seat stadium that would cost $30–50 million depending on the mix of public and private funds, but did not name potential sites. The club appointed John Neance as chairman and operating manager in September 2016, with a focus on planning for the stadium. In a December interview with The Courier-Journal, he revealed that the club had been actively acquiring property at a proposed site and were negotiating a public–private partnership to fund the project. The club hired HOK as the architect for the stadium project, which would also include a mixed-use development with offices and retail, in January 2017. On April 12, 2017, Louisville City FC announced its intention to build a 10,000-seat stadium on a industrial site in the Butchertown neighborhood east of Downtown Louisville. The stadium and surrounding development would cost a total of $200 million to construct, including financing assistance from the state government. In September, Mayor Fischer announced a $30 million financing plan from the city that would buy the necessary parcels at the stadium site and contribute to infrastructure improvements. The financing plan was approved by the Metro Council the following month, along with an application to the state government for tax increment financing for the surrounding development. Property acquisition of the four parcels that comprise the stadium site was completed in November 2018 at a cost of $24.1 million. The tax increment financing proposal was approved by the state government in May 2018, allowing for $21.7 million in financing over a 20-year period within a special district created by the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority. The club was criticized by a councilmember during early planning for removing a homeless camp at the stadium site in February 2018; the club ownership donated funds to a homeless advocacy group to house the displaced residents in hotels for two months. =Construction= The club and city government hosted a groundbreaking ceremony for the project on June 28, 2018, which included the ownership group, Kentucky governor Matt Bevin, and Louisville mayor Greg Fischer. The stadium was originally estimated to cost $45 million but costs rose to $60–65 million at the time of the groundbreaking. A joint venture of Messer Construction and Harmon Construction was selected as the general contractor for the stadium project in November 2018. By May 2019, work on the roof structure was two-thirds complete and the lower levels of the stadium were in place. The structural steel elements of the stadium were completed in July ahead of work on the grass surface, which was installed in September. Construction was completed in early March, with a formal handover ceremony as Louisville City FC took possession of the stadium. Lynn Family Stadium was scheduled to open on April 11, 2020, with a regular season match between Louisville City FC and Birmingham Legion FC. A fixture for Louisville City FC in the 2020 U.S. Open Cup was also scheduled on April 7. The home opener and cup fixture were cancelled by the suspension of USL and U.S. Open Cup play announced in March 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic. The opening date was pushed to July 12, 2020, with a home match against the Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC and capacity limited to 30 percent (4,600 spectators). In October 2019, the National Women's Soccer League awarded an expansion franchise to Louisville (later named Racing Louisville FC) that would begin play at Lynn Family Stadium in 2021. Naming rights On August 5, 2019, Louisville City FC announced that the stadium would be named Lynn Family Stadium for Dr. Mark and Cindy Lynn, who had purchased the ten- year naming rights for an undisclosed amount. Dr. Lynn, an optometrist, owns the Louisville-area franchise of the national optical retailer Visionworks, formerly known as Dr Bizer’s Vision World. The Lynns had also donated to the University of Louisville for construction of a collegiate soccer stadium named Dr. Mark & Cindy Lynn Stadium, which opened in 2014 and was designed by founding Louisville City FC owner Wayne Estopinal. Design In its initial configuration, Lynn Family Stadium has 11,700 seats, a Premier Club area with 250 seats, and 18 luxury suite boxes. The stadium's total capacity is 15,304 spectators with a safe standing area for supporters' groups and would be expandable to 20,000 with additional construction. The stands enclose three sides of the field, with the open end facing west towards the downtown bridges over the Ohio River; the open end also has a video board made by Daktronics, one of eight digital displays at the stadium. The playing surface is Bermuda grass sod that was grown in Indiana and is maintained with an underheating element. HOK designed the stadium and drew inspiration from other venues, including Earthquakes Stadium in San Jose, California, Rio Tinto Stadium in Sandy, Utah, and Little Caesars Arena in Detroit. The stadium is managed by AEG Facilities.

The Mosque of the Believers) is a Sunni orthodox mosque located on the near east side of Indianapolis, Indiana. Established in 2001, it is the third Islamic place of worship founded in the city of Indianapolis and serves a weekly prayer congregation of 150-250 men, women, and children. Masjid Al Mu'mineen houses the SHARE (Services for Human Advancement and Resource Enhancement) Center Inc., which is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization that acts as the mosque's community service arm. SHARE Center initiatives include an offender re-entry program called Siratal Mustaqeem (the Straight Path), a summer feeding program sponsored by the U.S. Department of Agriculture & Indiana Department of Education, and a food pantry that serves approximately 100 households per month. In 2015, the Shura Council voted unanimously to support the \\"ISNA Statement on Inclusion of Women in Masjids\\" created by the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA). In 2018, a portion of CNN's This is Life documentary series by Lisa Ling was filmed at Masjid Al Mu'mineen in addition to a brief interview with the mosque's board chairman Imam Ismail Abdul-Aleem.  History  Islamic institutions were established in Indianapolis, Indiana roughly between the 1940s and the 1980s, with African-American Muslim Institutions being established between the 1940s - 1950s and the immigrant Muslim institutions being established between the 1960s - 1980s.Further, by 1990 there were an estimated 2,000 Muslims living in the city of Indianapolis. By 2000, the Indianapolis Muslim population had increased and started to outgrow the city's primary orthodox place of worship Masjid Al Fajr (Indianapolis Muslim Community Association). Later that year, a group lead by Amin Alghani sought a new location in the city to establish another Islamic place of worship. After establishing ad hoc worship spaces in different locations, the group finally established Masjid Al Mu'muneen at its current location on the near east side of Indianapolis, Indiana.  Leadership and organization  The physical, data, and intellectual properties of Masjid Al Mu'mineen are owned by its Board of Trustees. Day-to-day operations are managed by the Shura Council, which is a 9-member Board of Directors that meets monthly.  Religious services  Masjid Al Mu'mineen offers several religious services to the Indianapolis Muslim community: # Salatul Jumu'ah (Friday Prayer): The friday prayer services are held weekly. Khatibs are selected from the pool of knowledgeable men in the Indianapolis Muslim community. # Marriage & Wedding Ceremonies: Nikah contract services offered to the Indianapolis Muslim Community. All Imams and Assistant Imans have authority to perform marriage within the State of Indiana and sign marriage licenses that are issued by the city. Marriages are performed according to Islamic legal customs. # Talaq/Khula (Divorce): Islamic divorce and mediation. Divorce agreements under Islamic legal customs does not mean couples are legally divorced in the State of Indiana. Final divorce proceedings should be done at Marion County City- County Building. # Janazah(Funeral): Preparation and prayer services.  SHARE Center and outreach  The Mosque has a 501(c)3 non-profit component in the SHARE Center of Indianapolis. This was formed to help the Mosque better implement its work within both their religious community and the greater community at large by providing. referral services for job training, employment, housing, mental health programs, and counseling as well as several community service programs, including: = Community service programs = #Siratal Mustaqeem (The Straight Path) Support Group: This is an initiate established in the early 2000s which focuses on helping both Muslim and non- muslim community members that have past battles with substance abuse, and other similar issues, to come together for sharing coping strategies, to feel more empowered and for a sense of community. #Lut's Food Pantry: In collaboration with the Gleaners Food Bank of Indiana, Al Huda Foundation, and other local supporters, Lut's Food Pantry is open two weekend per months and serves approximately 100 families. The food pantry is managed by the Women's Committee and draws monthly Muslim and non-Muslim volunteers of 10-15 people from central Indianapolis area. #Summer Feeding Program: The Summer Feeding Program is an affiliate and program site for Indianapolis' Summer Servings Program. It is also affiliated with the USDA Summer Food Service Program (SFSP). This program helps us serve all children under the age of 18 in Marion County. During the summer months, this program serves as a substitute for the meals (breakfast and lunch) that children would usually receive during the school year.  Beliefs  Masjid Al Mumineen adheres to the fundamental beliefs established by Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ) in the Qur'an and the Prophet Mohammad (صلى الله عليه وعلى آله وسلم) which are: =Articles of Faith (Aqeedah)= * Belief in God Almighty (Allah); that he is the Creator, Sustainer, and the only one that controls and holds dominion over all of creation. Belief in Allah requires recognizing that He is the only one worthy of our devotion, supplications, and worship. * Belief in all the Prophets of God; Adam, Noah (Nuh), Abraham (Ibrahim), Isaac (Ishaq), Jacob (Yaqub), Josep (Yusuf), Moses (Musa), Aaron (Harun), John the Baptist (Yahya), Jesus (Isa), and Muhammad (Peace and Blessing Upon Them All), as well as those not mentioned. We believe in all of them, recognize their mission, and follow them in their message of worshipping One God. * Belief in the original scriptures revealed by God Almighty to his Prophets; the Torah having been given to Moses, the Psalms to David, the Gospel to Jesus, and the Quran given to Muhammad (Peace and Blessing Upon Them All). All of these scriptures are recognized by Muslims as revelation. The Qur'an, God’s Almighty's final revelation is a culmination of message of the previous scriptures; it is a standard by which we live by containing eternal guidance for the salvation of Mankind. * Belief in the angels; that they are the unseen servants of God Almighty's, implementing his will and watching over mankind. * Belief in the Day of Judgment and the Hereafter; that all of mankind will be called to account for their deeds, and be righteously judged accordingly on the last day. * Belief in Divine design and decree; that God Almighty's has knowledge of all things, has written all things, and all things he has willed must come to pass. = Pillars of Islam (Acts of Worship) = * Shahada: Testifying that God Almighty is one, without spouse, son, or partner and that Muhammad (Peace and Blessing Be Upon Him) is the last Prophet & Messenger of God Almighty. This testimony pronounced to become a Muslim, and is repeated several times a day in prayers and devotions as an affirmation of God's oneness and a confirmation of faith. * Salah: Formal prayer five times a day. By praying five times a day, one actively submits his will to God Almighty and devotes his mind, body, and soul to his worship. Formal prayer is both preventative and prescriptive; it serves as a reminder to avoid evil deeds and helps to expiate the effects of any sin committed throughout the day. * Siyam: Fasting during the month of Ramadan. During Ramadan, Muslims fast each day from dawn to dusk by refraining from food, drinks and sensual pleasures. These outward actions have an effect on the inward, reminding believers that instead of being dependent on corporeal stimuli, they must rely on God Almighty alone. Abstaining from food & drink serves another purpose, that is to remind the believer of his duty to those less fortunate amongst fellow man, and that with God's bounties comes responsibility to our brothers and sisters in humanity. * Zakat: Alms to the Poor. With the blessing of wealth comes responsibility to give back to those less fortunate. Zakat, the Arabic word for obligatory alms, is a purification of wealth and a method of redistributing wealth to those in need. * Hajj: Pilgrimage to Mecca at least once, if physically and financially able. Pilgrimage to Makkah commemorates the rites of Abraham in devoting his life to God Almighty. It is the culmination of the previous four pillars of Islam, consisting of prayers, devotions, charity & sacrifice.

His paternal grandparents are Wilhelm Stierlin, director of the Königlich Württembergische Eisenbahn (1853-1906), nobility by awarding the Hausorden der Württembergischen Krone, and his wife Anna Stierlin, née Bilfinger (1856-1928). Johann Wendelin Bilfinger, dean in Cannstatt, later Protestant abbot, is an ancestor of Helm Stierlin and the father of Georg Bernhard Bilfinger. Stierlin's maternal grandparents are the manor owner Eduard Schöningh and his wife Elisabeth. Helm Stierlin is married to the Swiss psychologist and family therapist Satuila Stierlin. Two daughters are descended from the marriage.Wolf Ritscher: Helm Stierlin - My personal encounter with Helm StierlinHelm and Satu Helm Stierlin grew up in Mannheim, Großwallstadt, Neckarsteinach and from 1935 to 1945 in Stettin. Due to his father's job, the Stierlin family moved several times. As a young soldier Helm took part in the Second World War. After the Unconditional surrender of the Wehrmacht on May 7, 1945, he succeeded as a 19-year-old in reaching his homeland via Prague without being captured. Helm Stierlin's younger brother Gerhard died at the age of 17 in the Second World War.Satuila Stierlin: I burned with curiosity. Family stories of important family therapists\\". Carl Auer Systems, Heidelberg 2001, , p. 200-216. = Medical education = When the universities reopened their doors in 1945, Helm Stierlin enrolled for the medicine at the University of Heidelberg after completing an emergency baccalaureate. Parallel to the compulsory medical lectures and seminars, Stierlin attended the philosophical lectures of Karl Jaspers as often as he could, which demanded a balancing act from him every now and then, since the lecture venues of the medical faculty and the philosophical faculty were far apart from each other, but the compulsory lectures and the optional lectures at Karl Jaspers in Philosophy that interested him were very close in their schedule. Besides Jasper's approaches, the Hegel school of thought for Stierlin remained a lifelong paradigm.University clinic for Psychosomatic Medicine, old hospital in Heidelberg-BergheimClinic for General Internal Medicine and Psychosomatics Besides yet unresolved derailments of the ethical attitudes and medical practices of some professors at the medical faculties of the universities of Germany during the National Socialism period, there were many positive research approaches and new interdisciplinary ties and connections in Heidelberg after 1945, which had been initiated in particular by the scientific approaches and research work of Viktor von Weizsäcker and Alexander Mitscherlich. In 1950, a chair for psychosomatic medicine was established at the University of Heidelberg, of which Viktor von Weizsäcker became the first holder. Mitscherlich, who played a major role in the establishment of the institute,Universitätsklinikum Heidelberg: Allgemeine Innere Medizin & Psychosomatik left Heidelberg in 1960 and moved to Frankfurt am Main, where he became the first director after the war at the newly founded Sigmund Freud Institute. Stierlin received his doctorate in philosophy in 1950 from Karl Jaspers at the University of Heidelberg with a dissertation on: \\"The Concept of Responsibility: Attempt at a Discussion of John Dewey's Pragmatic Ethics of science in Comparison with the Ethik of Kant with Consideration of Max Weber's Concept of Science\\". The rapporteur was Kurt Rossmann, the co- rapporteur was Hans-Georg Gadamer. Five years later, Stierlin received his doctorate in medicine from Kurt Kolle and Gustav Bodechtel at the Medical Faculty of the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München with a dissertation on the subject: \\"The violent patient: An investigation into the attacks perpetrated by the mentally ill on doctors and nurses\\".  Professional career  In 1957 Helm Stierlin went to the United States. Here he worked and researched in particular about psychosomatic medicine, the psychopathology of schizophrenia, psychosis, about the process of detachment in adolescence and the most recent therapeutic experiences in family therapy with the expanding therapeutic concepts within the framework of system-theoretical approaches. Stierlin interrupted his stay in America for one year from 1963 to 1964 in order to pursue further training at the Sanatory Bellevue in Kreuzlingen. From 1965 to 1973 he headed the Department of Family Therapy at the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Maryland. During his years in America, he was invited to guest lectureships and visiting professorships at various American universities. He also followed invitations to guest lectures and lectures in New Zealand and Australia. During his time in the USA, Stierlin got to know the most important pioneers in the field of family therapy research, including Gregory Bateson, Milton H. Erickson, Jay Haley, Margaret Mead, Salvador Minuchin, Virginia Satir and John Weakland. In 1974 Helm Stierlin received a call to the University Clinic Heidelberg for the newly established chair Department of Psychoanalytic Basic Research and Family Therapy. He held this chair until his retirement in 1991.Helm Stierlin: Abteilung für Psychoanalytische Grundlagenforschung und Familientherapie Stierlin familiarized his students with the interdisciplinary discourses and research results in the field of etiology and pathogenesis of schizophrenic diseases.

He was a part of the Manchu-Mongol Independence Movement and the Shandong Autonomy Movement. He was a descendant of Date Masamune and a member of the Date clan. Early life Date Junnosuke was born to a Kazoku family, descended from the Daimyō of the Sendai Domain, the Date clan. His grandfather, Date Munenari, was a politician under Emperor Meiji. His father, Date Muneatsu, was the governor of the Sendai Domain. He went to several schools, including Azabu Junior High School, Keio Junior High School, Gakushuin, and Rikkyo Junior High School. He finally graduated from Kaijo Junior High School in 1914 and was accepted into Waseda University to study at the Faculty of Literature. However, he later dropped out.Suzuki, Shichirо̄. Date Junnosuke. Date was known for not being a well-behaved youth. As a student in Rikkyo Junior High School, on May 13, 1909, an argument with delinquent youths in Akashichō, Tokyo, escalated to the point where Date pulled out his gun and shot them, killing them. On October 15, 1909, the Tokyo District Court sentenced him to 12 years in prison. The sentence was shortened to 6 years after an appeal ruling in June 1910, at the request of the Date family lawyers. Detective Saburo Iwai's investigation of the victim's behavior helped the Date family lawyers' defence that he was acting in self-defence. The Supreme Court of Judicature of Japan gave him probation and released him.Suzuki, Shichirо̄. Date Junnosuke no Ayunda Michi (The Life of Date Junnosuke), Taisei Shinbunsha, Tokyo, 1964. Political activities Date was good friends with Ikki Kita, Shumei Okawa, and Onisaburo Ideguchi. He participated in a 1916 plot to assassinate Zhang Zuolin and a 1919 plot to assassinate Yamagata Aritomo. In 1916, Kawashima Naniwa and Aisin-Gioro Shanyu created the Second Manchu-Mongol Independence Movement, which Date joined. He traveled to China, where he became a continental ronin. After the movement's failure, he created the Shandong Autonomy Allied Army in 1938 under the orders of Terauchi Hisaichi. In 1929, he made a pact of brotherhood with Fengtian clique warlord Zhang Zongchang, leading to Date renaming himself Zhang Zongyuan and trying to integrate into Chinese society, changing his nationality to Chinese in 1931.Suzuki, Shichirо̄.

He took over Jinan and used it as his headquarters as the \\"King\\" of Shandong.Billingsley, Phil. Bandits in Republican China, Stanford University Press, 1988, p. 224. He advised many bandit units in the Jehol campaign.Jowett, Philip S. The Bitter Peace: Conflict in China 1928-37, Amberley Publishing Limited, 2017. In late January 1939, he led a massacre in Ye County (today known as Laizhou), killing around 400 people. This was known as the Yexian (Ye County) Incident, and led to the dissolution of Date's unit in 1940.Watanabe, Ryūsaku.

In 1945, Date tried to organize a unit called the Zhang Zongyuan Unit, but his attempt was unsuccessful and the unit failed quickly. After the surrender of Japan at the end of World War II, Date was arrested for war crimes. He was held in the Qingdao Detention Center and moved to the Shanghai Temporary War Criminal Detention Center.

Jay Chou's text: \\"The first broadcast at 11:00 on the 16th, I can only say that if you don't catch the first broadcast, you will cry! Just like watching the game, others have told you who won the game... then you will say, 'Why don’t you tell me the first broadcast early', then I will say, I have already told you...”  Interpretation  \\"Won't Cry\\" is a love song about \\"fulfill\\" and \\"promise\\".

The atmosphere of a love movie; the lyrics are the first person of the boy, and the mood transition and story line of this love; a few short lyrics that illustrates the love between men and women because they consider each other too much.

He is regarded as one of the foremost labor poets of South Korea, along with Park Nohae and Baek Mu-san. His poetry combines his personal experiences of labor with philosophical reflections to offer a critique of contemporary capitalistic society.  Life  Choi was born in Jangseong, Jeollanam-do (or South Jeolla Province) in 1954. After graduating from middle school he moved to Seoul. In the early 1970s, he started working as a welder. Unlike other poets who learned about poetry through formal education, Choi says his forays into poetry began from doodles and scribbling.Lee Guncheong, “Welder-Poet Choi Jongcheon says ‘labor is sacred and must be respected’”, Munhwa Journal 21, 2008.12.19. Some of the poems in his first collection Nunmuleun pureuda (눈물은 푸르다 Tears are Blue, 2002), for instance “Koseumoseu seom (코스모스 섬Cosmos Island)” and “Mihonmo (미혼모 Single Mother),” started out as scribbles jotted down in his childhood notebooks. Choi’s boss, a college graduate, happened to see his notebook one day and was the first person to tell him about the existence of ‘poetry.’ He also encouraged Choi to try writing poems himself. Choi worked as a delivery person for a Chinese restaurant sometimes and would collect literary magazines from the piles he found left out on the stairs of the Hyundae Sihak magazine offices in Chungjeongno.Entry for Jeon Bonggeon in the Encyclopedia of Korean Culture. 2019.07.22. He read these in his spare time, but never attended a writing class. After seeing a notice at the famous classical music cafe Renaissance, he joined his first amateur literary writing group and began composing poetry. He debuted in the late 1980s when his poems were published in the 1986 and 1988 issues of Segyeui munhak. After becoming a published poet, Choi continued to read poetry but not literary journals. His preferred reading is philosophy and biology. He considers his poetry to be a critique of humans; in lamenting the reality of capitalism’s odious effects, he believes one can achieve a truer awareness of the self. His poetry prizes physical labor over white-collar labor, which he perceives as work that deals with symbols. Focusing on the intricate relations of labor, humans, and culture, Choi has built up a powerful body of work. He is the recipient of the Shin Dongyup Writing Prize (2002) and the Oh Janghwan Literature Prize (2012).  Writing  = The relationship between labor and art = Being a labor poet, Choi Jongcheon’s poetry offer deep reflections about the relationship between labor and art.Pak Seonghan, “[Incheon The 6th Meet a Writer of Our Times: Poet Choi Jongcheon”]. 2019.07.22. He is known for his ability to discern and describe artistry in the labor process and the sites in which these occur, and is often referred to as “a poet who bridges art and labor”. His first collection of poetry, Nunmuleun pureuda was published in 2002, sixteen years after his debut. In one of the poems in the collection, “Buran mueosinga (부란 무엇인가 What is Wealth?)”, Choi addresses the ways in which he is perceived as an anomaly for being a poetry-writing laborer, and criticizes the social reality that enforces the alienation of labor from culture. This critical stance continues in the 2007 collection Naeui bapgeureusi binnanda (나의 밥그릇이 빛난다 My Rice-bowl Shines) as he calls to task the falsehood or fabricated nature of symbols.Maeng Munjae, “The Poetics of the Real” in Choi Jongcheon, Naeui bapgeureusi binnanda, Changbi, 2007. In “Naneun sobidoenda (나는 소비된다 I am Consumed)” he exposes the vanity of those who make use of (and name-drop) the collected works of Hegel or Beethoven as empty symbols to be consumed. Choi Jongcheon is relentless in his critique of the disparity between labor and art, which is not to say he dismisses or negates culture and the arts.Kim Woochang, “Labor in the Age of Culture” in Choi Jongcheon, Nunmuleun pureuda, Siwa sihaksa, 2002. True art as he sees it is only possible when the distance between labor and art is bridged, for it is, in the truest sense of liberated labor, itself labor. = Labor as liberation = For the labor poet Choi Jongcheon, there are two broad categories of labor: labor as miserable or wretched reality and labor as true liberation. Based on his own experiences as a welder, the poor working conditions and environments of laborers is a recurring subject in his poetry. In “Chulgeun - jigak (출근 - 지각 Clock-in – Late Arrival)”, a poem collected in Nunmuleun pureuda, Choi depicts the cumulative effects of fatigue and hard labor on the mind and body through descriptions of colleagues who work through the graveyard shift even as they are ill. But Choi doesn’t only write exposés of labor conditions. The importance of labor’s power to liberate mankind is stressed throughout. The labor class is “the true priesthood” for Choi, just as the ideology of the working class is “the ultimate philosophy and religion” and the only means of “bringing Man back to life”.Choi Jongcheon, “Poet’s Note” in Choi Jongcheon, Naeui bapgeureusi binnanda, Changbi, 2007. In Goyangiui masul (고양이의 마술 Cat’s Magic, 2011), Choi champions the value of labor especially in contrast to corrupt capital.Jeong Ayang, “Through Thick and Thin I Wrote with My Guts”, Maeil Business Newspaper, 2011.04.12. Labor is the foundation that sustain the world (“Mangchiege <망치에게 To Hammer>”, and it is through the liberation of labor that the harmful abuses of capital can be thwarted and its effects healed (“Eotteoke dareulkka <어떻게 다를까 How Does It Differ?>). Further, true liberation of and through labor is to ensure labor itself becomes art that is freeing, and freely undertaken (Insaengeun jjalgo gigyeneun yeongwonhada <인생은 짧고 기계는 영원하다 Life is Brief, Machines are Forever, 2018>).Book description for Insaengeun jjalgo gigyeneun yeongwonhada, Naver Book. 2019.07.22. How far these claims lie from a subjective labor- and laborer-centrism is a matter for debate. But what is certain is that labor as liberation as espoused by Choi Jongcheon’s poetry is without doubt an urgent literary topic for the 21st century, as evidenced by discussions of the exigencies brought about by “the end of work”.

History  The regiment was raised on 16 September 1859 in Voghera as Regiment \\"Cavalleggeri di Montebello\\" with a three squadrons transferred from the regiments \\"Cavalleggeri di Novara\\", \\"Cavalleggeri di Aosta\\", and \\"Cavalleggeri di Monferrato\\", which had all three distinguished themselves in the Battle of Montebello four months earlier, making the \\"Lancieri di Montebello\\" the only Italian Army cavalry regiment named after a battle. Already in 1860 the regimented changed from a Chevau-léger unit to a Lancer unit. During World War I the regiment served on the Italian Front and disbanded after the war on 20 May 1920. On 15 July 1942 a reconnaissance group was raised, which received the name \\"Lancieri di Montebello\\". After Italy changed sides with the Armistice of Cassibile on 8 September 1943 the group, together with the 12th Infantry Division \\"Sassari\\", 21st Infantry Division \\"Granatieri di Sardegna\\", and 135th Armored Division \\"Ariete II\\", defended Rome against Wehrmacht forces. On 16 September the Granatieri, Lancieri di Montebello, remnants of the Sassari and hundreds of civilians fell back to Porta San Paolo for a last stand. By 17:00 the Germans broke the line of the Italian defenders, who had suffered 570 dead. Soon after the units surrendered to the Germans as the flight of the Italian King Victor Emmanuel III from Rome had made further resistance senseless. For their role in the defence of the Rome the 1st Regiment \\"Granatieri di Sardegna\\" and the \\"Lancieri di Montebello\\" were each awarded a Silver Medal of Military Valour. On 1 January 1950 the Squadrons Group \\"Lancieri di Montebello\\" was raised, which on 1 May 1951 was expanded to 8th Armored Cavalry Regiment \\"Lancieri di Montebello\\". On 4 November 1958 the regiment returned to use its traditional title: Regiment \\"Lancieri di Montebello\\" (8th). The regiment consisted of three squadrons groups equipped with M47 Patton tanks and M113 armored personnel carriers. During the 1975 army reform the regiment contracted on 30 September to 8th Armored Squadrons Group \\"Lancieri di Montebello\\" equipped with M47 Patton tanks and M113 armored personnel carriers. On 1 July 1979 the squadrons group retired its M47 Patton tanks and became the 8th Mechanized Squadrons Group \\"Lancieri di Montebello\\". On 23 September 1992 the squadrons group was renamed as Regiment \\"Lancieri di Montebello\\" (8th) without changing size. Around the same time the regiment began to receive wheeled Centauro tank destroyers. With the army reform of 1997 the regiment joined the Mechanized Brigade \\"Granatieri di Sardegna\\" as the brigade's reconnaissance unit. In March 2004 the regiment raised the Horse Squadrons Group to perform mounted public duties in Rome. Today the regiment is the reconnaissance unit of the Mechanized Brigade \\"Granatieri di Sardegna\\" and the army's mounted public duties unit.  Current structure  As of 2019 the Regiment \\"Lancieri di Montebello\\" (8th) consists of: * 30px Regimental Command, in Rome ** Military Equestrian Center ** Command and Logistic Support Squadron ** 1st Reconnaissance Squadrons Group *** 1st Reconnaissance Squadron *** 2nd Reconnaissance Squadron *** 3rd Reconnaissance Squadron *** Heavy Armor Squadron ** Horse Squadrons Group *** 1st Mounted Squadron *** 2nd Mounted Squadron The Command and Logistic Support Squadron fields the following platoons: C3 Platoon, Transport and Materiel Platoon, Medical Platoon, and Commissariat Platoon. The three reconnaissance squadrons are equipped with VTLM Lince vehicles and Centauro tank destroyers, the latter of which are scheduled to be replaced by Freccia reconnaissance vehicles. The Heavy Armor Squadron is equipped with Centauro tank destroyers, which are being replaced by Centauro II tank destroyers.

John Dunbar (1804-1857) was a missionary who tried to Christianize the Pawnee Indians of Nebraska during the 1830s-1840s.  Early life  Born in Palmer, Massachusetts shortly after the American Revolution, John Dunbar grew up in the fertile cultural soil of western New England. The Connecticut River Valley was a region awash with revivalistic evangelical religion and the zeal for social reform, much as the more well- known Burned-over district of Western New York. Indeed, Dunbar grew up in the shadow of missionary endeavor. He attended Williams College, where the 1806 Haystack Prayer Meeting took place, the birthplace of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions and the symbolic origin of the entire antebellum missionary movement.  Heading West  Dunbar continued his education at Andover Theological Seminary, even as he began considering the cause of missions. He graduated and was ordained as a Presbyterian minister in 1834 and left for the western frontier that same year under the authority of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. He was joined on the journey by Samuel Parker and an assistant missionary, Samuel Allis. Their original aim had been to go further West and minister to the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, known at the time as the Flatheads. In St. Louis, the missionaries changed their minds, and Parker headed back to New England, though he would go on to fame as a missionary to Oregon.  The Pawnee Mission  Instead, Dunbar and Allis decided to apply their evangelistic efforts more locally and instead made a base camp in Bellevue, Nebraska where Moses Merrill, a Baptist missionary, was already at work amongst the Otoe–Missouria Indians. Over the next two years, Dunbar and Allis joined the Pawnee Indians bands on their biannual buffalo hunts across the Nebraskan Great Plains. Dunbar returned to Massachusetts to marry Esther Smith, whose own sister had died in the mission field at the Bombay Mission in modern-day Mumbai.The Pawnee Mission Letters, 1834-1851, ed, Richard E. Jensen (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2012), 202, https://books.google.com/books?id=4V_omWLeOnMC&pg;=PA202. Allis and the Dunbars continued to work sporadically with the Pawnees from Bellevue until 1841, when the missionaries built their own lodgings not far from the Pawnees' main village nearby modern-day Fullerton, Nebraska, in rural Nance County. A small settlement of white settlers developed around the mission, as treaty- appointed blacksmiths, teachers and farmers arrived to assist the Pawnee on the federal dime. Factionalism soon divided the American settlement, in part based upon disagreements about how to resolve Pawnee-white disputes. Dunbar and Allis largely supported the Pawnees' perspectives during these disagreements, which worsened the factionalism but allowed the missionaries to maintain warm relations with the Pawnees. Nonetheless, none of the Pawnees were particularly drawn to the Christian message. Dunbar's efforts had come up empty and the growing threat of Lakota raids in the region forced the missionaries to flee the mission in 1846.  Later life  Their mission work at an end, the Dunbars moved first to Andrew County and then Holt County, Missouri. They moved again in 1856 to Brown County, Kansas where John Dunbar died the next year.  Dances with Wolves  Interestingly, the acclaimed 1990 Western film Dances with Wolves starred Kevin Costner as a fictional character named Lt. John Dunbar. This fictional Dunbar supported the Indian cause against white rapacity and witnessed Pawnee and Lakota wars, much as the real Dunbar did. And, as it happens, John Dunbar's son, John Brown Dunbar, did fight in the Civil War. However, the name was not chosen for historical reasons. Michael Blake, the screenwriter, explained that he invented his main character by splicing together various period names from a list of men who served in the American Civil War. Blake was cheered by this happenstance: \\"In a mystical sort of way, I feel sort of vindicated that there was a John Dunbar out there.\\"Jeff Donn, \\"Fiction, History Intersect in a Name, John Dunbar\\", The Day, April 17, 1991, via Google News Archive.

Writing  = Earlier work = Hwang Myung’s poetry that dates back to the 1950s stem from deep reflections about Korean contemporary history and in particular the Korean War. It was Hwang’s belief at the time that as long as poetry was a crystallization of the people’s language, it could not limit itself to sorrow, mourning, and despair. Through poems like “Bunsu” Hwang sought to recover and rekindle a sense of inner strength and hope for the Korean people and thus to rouse them out of despondency.Won Hyeonggap, “Hwang Myung and Thirty Years of Sorrow in Korean Poetry” in Hwang Myung, Narara achimui saedeuriyeo (날아라 아침의 새들이여 Fly, Morning Birds), Yejeonsa, 1985, pp.140~141. = Later works = The development of Hwang’s poetic landscape in his later work is very well represented in the posthumous collection Bunsu and Namok (분수와 나목 Fountain and Bare Tree, 1999).

His writing career dates back to the 1960s, when he was active as a modernist poet. During the 1970–80s, his poetry engaged critically with the politics of the time. From the 1990s, Hong’s focus shifted to Buddhist thought, and the serial poem Maeumgyung (마음경 The Book of the Mind), which was written over a period over twenty years, is considered his major work.  Life  Hong was born in 1944 in Hwaseong, Gyunggi Province. From a young age he studied Chinese literary classics under the guidance of his great-uncle, and grew up reading classical texts such as Samgukji (삼국지 Records of the Three Kingdoms).Author profile on aladin.co.kr. As a middle-school student, he read Kim Naesung’s popular detective story Main (마인 Fiend) and began to dream of becoming a novelist. Throughout his years at high school he read the literary journals Jayumunhak and Hakwon and wrote his own stories. Hong has spoken about how this period improved and influenced his writing by building up his vocabulary and training him in descriptive technique. Once at university, Hong’s interest shifted from prose fiction to poetry. After three years of writing and honing his craft, he officially debuted as a poet while in his senior year when his poem “The Greek’s Pipe” was selected for publication in the journal Shinmunhak in 1965. The poem was influenced by the Greek myths he had been reading throughout college. In 1968, Hong set up the literary coterie magazine Hanguksi with Oh Kyuwon and others. In 1970 he married one of his fellow coterie members, the poet Ro Hyang-Rim. In the 1980s he left Seoul and settled in Andong, North Gyeongsang Province. There his world expanded from the narrower confines of literary circles, and he came into closer contact with the diverse lives around him. This brought about a big shift in his poetry. In 2003 he founded the literary magazine Munhak Seon (or Zen, 선禪), and remains its publisher and editor.“[Special Feature] In Search of the Poet Hong Shin-seon”, Yeolinsihak, March 2010 Issue.  Writing  = People-oriented poetry = Although he himself had engaged in numerous debates and discussions about literature and politics with fellow coterie members and writers since his debut in 1965, Hong Shin-seon recalls how after moving to Andong in the 1980s and coming into daily contact with ordinary lives, he came to realize the speciousness of the very reality or ideologies that he and his friends had so often talked about. Hong felt that the people he encountered in Andong were “a key-hole, a password, and a symbol” in that they would allow him to “observe contemporary life”. Uri iut saramdeul (우리 이웃 사람들 Our Neighbors, 1984), an earlier collection from this period, features people from broad walks of life, from tearoom servers and people in migrant communities to brokers.“[Special Feature] In Search of the Poet Hong Shin-seon”, Yeolinsihak, March 2010 Issue. Searching for the right form and way to depict the lives of people in an honest, truthful manner, Hong eventually came to turn to a sort of narrative poetry, or storied poetry.Yi Deokhun, “Putting one’s soul into the writing of poetry is a process rife with adventure”, Chosun Ilbo, 2004.03.07. This collection marks Hong’s transition from brooding critical and intellectual poet to a poet interested in the lives of his neighbors.Publisher’s book synopsis. This is still very much apparent in his next collection, Dasi gohyangeseo (다시 고향에서 Home Again, 1990), even if the backdrop is now the poet’s own hometown of Hwaseong rather than Andong. The poems collected here are especially notable for their embodiment of giving voice and form to agricultural/farming communities that have been hollowed out by industrialization and the loss of traditional forms of life and teeter on the brink of ruin.“[Special Feature] In Search of the Poet Hong Shin-seon”, Yeolinsihak, March 2010 Issue. Hong’s attention to marginalized or excluded ‘neighbors’ continue in Salmui ongi (삶의 옹이 Gnarl of Life, 2014).Cho Minseo, “Salmui ongi asks unending questions about life and death”, The Asia Business Daily, 2014.05.26. = Maeumgyung Series = Hong Shin-seon published the first installment of his serial poem “Maeungyung” in 1991 and the last installment, collected in Uyeoneul jeom jjikda (우연을 점 찍다 Marking Out Coincidence), in 2009.Lee Gowoon, “Hong Shin-seon’s new collection Uyeoneul jeom jjikda offers deep contemplations on life and death”, The Korea Economic Daily, 2009.06.08. This series of poems ponder life and death from the perspective of Buddhist thought. Hong says the impulse for this work came from the strong aversion he felt toward the general prevalence of poetry purporting to represent reality, as well as from the considerable shock he experienced at the demise of the socialist countries of the Eastern bloc, which prompted him to seek out work that was more reflective and that interrogated one’s inner life.“[Special Feature] In Search of the Poet Hong Shin-seon”, Yeolinsihak, March 2010 Issue. As for his growing interest in Buddhism, he points to Kim Daljin’s poetry and the Buddhist seon poemsSeon poems refer to poetry that reflects Seon Buddhist thought (선사상 禪思想) and the process by which one attains or strives for awakening. translated by Kim as a direct influence on him.Park Roksam, “The 21st Kim Daljin Literature Prize: 'I will eradicate rather than compromise my poetry'”, Seoul Shinmun, 2010.05.26. Hong’s serial poem captures his own dawning realization that life can be viewed much more clearly when one confronts rather than turns away from the solitude and futility of existence.Baek Wonki, “The Poetics of Hong Shin-seon’s Maeungyung”, Buddhism Journal, 2011.10.15.

Originally a Dragoon unit of the Savoyard state its recruiting area was the Duchy of Aosta. The regiment reformed as a Lancer unit in 1860. Today the regiment is the reconnaissance unit of the Mechanized Brigade \\"Aosta\\".  History  The regiment was raised on 16 September 1774 in Voghera by order of King Victor Amadeus III, who made his fifteen year old son Victor Emmanuel, Duke of Aosta the regiment's honorary colonel. Victor Emmanuel named the regiment for his duchy Cavalry Regiment \\"Aosta\\". The regiment was formed with six squadrons transferred in pairs of two from three existing cavalry regiments: Génévois Dragoons, Royal Piedmont Cavalry, and Savoy Cavalry. = Napoleonic Wars = In 1792 King Victor Amadeus III joined the War of the First Coalition against the First French Republic and the regiment had its baptism of fire in the County of Nice against French troops. The regiment fought against the French Army of Italy during the French campaign in Italy until in 1796 the newly appointed commander of the Army of Italy Napoleon Bonaparte defeated the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia in one month. After King Victor Amadeus III had been forced to sign the Armistice of Cherasco the \\"Aosta\\" regiment was disbanded and its remaining squadrons transferred to the Royal Piedmont Cavalry and Savoy Cavalry. = Italian Wars of Independence = The regiment was reformed on 3 October 1831 in Vercelli by order of King Charles Albert as Regiment \\"Aosta Cavalleria\\" with six squadrons of dragoons. The regiment participated in the First Italian War of Independence, during which the regiment fought in 1848 at the battles of Goito Bridge, Mantua, Santa Lucia, Goito, Sommacampagna and Custoza. In 1849 the regiment distinguished itself at the Battle of Novara for which it was awarded a Silver Medal of Military Valour. After the defeat in the First Italian War of Independence the Kingdom of Sardinia reformed its military and the Aosta was reorganized as a Chevau- léger unit and renamed \\"Cavalleggeri di Aosta\\". During the Second Italian War of Independence the regiment fought at Castelnuovo Scrivia, Montebello, and San Martino, and participated in the siege of Peschiera. Lancers arresting two brigands in 1864 In 1860 the regiment was reorganized as Lancer unit and renamed \\"Lancieri di Aosta\\". Between February 1863 and March 1864 the regiment was employed in the counter-insurgency role against \\"brigands\\" in Southern Italy near Capitanata, in the Murge, and around Bari. During the Third Italian War of Independence the regiment fought on 24 June 1866 at the Battle of Custoza, where the regiment charged the Austrian lines 14 times to allow the Italian I Division to retreat from the Imperial advance. For this feat the regiment became only the second cavalry regiment and the only cavalry regiment in the 19th century to be awarded a Gold Medal of Military Valour. After the Italian Army had crossed the Po on 7 July the regiment rapidly advanced northwards reaching Udine on the 25th of the same month. In 1870 the regiment participated in the Capture of Rome. In 1871 the regiment was renamed 6th Cavalry Regiment (Aosta), and in 1876 Cavalry Regiment \\"Aosta\\" (6th), and in 1897 Regiment \\"Lancieri di Aosta\\" (6th). = World War I = During World War I the regiment served as infantry, until 17 November 1915 on the lower Isonzo and from May 1916 on the Asiago plateau, where Austro-Hungarian army tried to break through the Italian lines. During the Eleventh Battle of the Isonzo the regiment fought on the Banjšice Plateau. After the disastrous defeat in the Battle of Caporetto the regiment covered the Italian retreat to the Piave river, fighting rearguard actions at Cividale del Friuli e Fagagna. In 1918, after the Italian crushing victory at the Battle of Vittorio Veneto, the regiment, like all cavalry regiments, was ordered to advance as fast and as far as possible and to take the bridges of the Tagliamento and Isonzo rivers. The Aosta took the bridge over the Tagliamento at Latisana on 3 November 1918 and charged Austro-Hungarian defenses at Corgnolo on 4 November, the last day of the war. For the capture of the bridge and the last charge of the war the regiment received a Bronze Medal of Military Valour. After the war the Italian Army disbanded 14 of its 30 cavalry regiments and on 20 May 1920 the Aosta received the 3rd and 4th squadrons from the disbanding Regiment \\"Cavalleggeri di Caserta\\" (17th). The two squadrons were merged and integrated into the Aosta as 2nd Squadron and the regiment was renamed Regiment \\"Cavalleggeri di Aosta\\" (6th). In 1920 the army disbanded a further five regiments and the Aosta received on 1 July the 1st and 2nd squadrons from the disbanding Regiment \\"Lancieri di Milano\\" (7th); with the 2nd Squadron carrying the traditions of the Regiment \\"Cavalleggeri di Roma\\" (20th), which had been disbanded in 1919. The Aosta now consisted of: * Regiment \\"Cavalleggeri di Aosta\\" (6th) ** I Squadrons Group *** 1st Squadron \\"Cavalleggeri di Aosta\\" *** 2nd Squadron \\"Cavalleggeri di Caserta\\" ** II Squadrons Group *** 3rd Squadron \\"Lancieri di Milano\\" *** 4th Squadron \\"Cavalleggeri di Roma\\" ** Regimental Depot On 1 March 1930 the regiment received a 5th Squadron equipped with eight heavy machine guns, 15 trucks for the regimental train, twelve motorbikes, and three R/3 radios. On 8 February 1934 the regiment returned to use its traditional name Regiment \\"Lancieri di Aosta\\" (6th). The next June the regiment raised two more squadron groups: the III Truck-mounted Machine Gunner Squadrons Group in Torre Annunziata and the IV Truck-mounted Machine Gunner Squadrons Group in Baiae. Each group fielded three machine gunner squadrons of 120 men and one command squadron of 60 men. Both machine gunner groups were deployed to Italian Somaliland for the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. On 20 January 1937 the two groups, together with the I and II Squadron Groups of the Regiment \\"Genova Cavalleria\\" (4th), participated in conquest of Neghelli, for which each group was awarded a Bronze Medal of Military Valour. After their return to Italy in late spring 1937 the III and IV group were disbanded. For the Italian military intervention in the Spanish Civil War the Aosta was ordered to provide a platoon of 64 volunteers. On 7 April 1939 the regiment's I Squadrons Group participated in the Italian invasion of Albania. = World War II = The regiment entered World War II with the following structure: * Regiment \\"Lancieri di Aosta\\" (6th) ** Regimental Command (includes signals, logistics, medics, etc.) ** I Squadrons Group *** 1st Lancers Squadron *** 2nd Lancers Squadron ** II Squadrons Group *** 3rd Lancers Squadron *** 4th Lancers Squadron ** 5th Machine Gunners Squadron ** Regimental Depot, in Naples The regiment fielded 37 officers, 810 non-commissioned officers and soldiers, 758 saddle horses, 52 pack horses, 36 machine pistols, 12 machine guns, 31 bicycles, 6 motorbikes and 15 trucks. In summer 1940 the regiment, together with the Regiment \\"Lancieri di Milano\\" (7th) and Regiment \\"Cavalleggeri Guide\\" (19th), was deployed to Italian occupied Albania for Benito Mussolini's upcoming invasion of Greece. The three regiments formed the Fast Coastal Grouping (Raggruppamento Celere del Litorale) on the extreme right of the Italian front. On 28 October 1940 the Italian attack commenced, but it quickly devolved into a military disaster. On 10 1940 the Aosta crossed the enemy lines to raid Greek depots at Paramythia, for which the regiment was awarded a War Cross of Military Valour. After its return to Italian lines the regiment spent the rest of the war on the defensive until Nazi Germany's Wehrmacht invaded Yugoslavia and Greece. After the German defeat of Greece the Aosta was on occupation duty in Athens and Piraeus. In the meantime back in Naples the regimental depot had raised the IV Machine Gunner Squadrons Group \\"Aosta\\" for service in the Western Desert Campaign. The squadrons group arrived in Tobruk in September 1941 and was attached to the 102nd Motorised Division \\"Trento\\". The IV Squadrons Group remained in the North African theater until its remnants surrendered to Allied Forces at the end of the Tunisian Campaign in 1943. In 1942 the Aosta regiment remained on garrison duty in Greece between the Corinth Canal and Megara, and later in Lamia and Larissa, where the regiment skirmished with Greek partisans. On 8 September 1943 the regiment was dislocated between Trikala and Karditsa when it was informed that Italy had switched sides with the Armistice of Cassibile. Without orders from the Italian High Command the Aosta regiment's commander Colonel Giuseppe Berti refused German demands to surrender, contacted the British Middle East Command in Cairo, placed his unit under British command and marched it into the Pindus Mountains, where the regiment, together with the 24th Infantry Division \\"Pinerolo\\" joined the Greek partisans of ELAS and EDES. In Greece the regiment had been reinforced with the XXXI Group on Foot and one battery from the 18th Field Artillery Regiment, bringing the regiment's strength on 10 September 1943 to 48 officers, 1,718 non- commissioned officers and soldiers, around 800 horses, 52 machine pistols, 38 machine guns, 31 bicycles, 6 motorbikes and 15 trucks. In coming weeks the regiment clashed with German forces at Kalabaka and 100 men raided the Luftwaffe's air field at Larissa. In October 1944 the German Wehrmacht began its retreat from Greece. On 12 October 1944 the remaining German forces left Athens as the British 23rd Armoured Brigade had landed in Piraeus. On 14 October 1944 the British forces under General Ronald Scobie liberated Athens. On the same day ELAS partisans tried to disarm the troops of the Aosta regiment. In the ensuing fighting 20 Italians were killed and 49 wounded. By nightfall the regiment acquiesced to the demands and surrendered its weapons. The remnants of the regiment were repatriated by the Royal Navy on 28 October 1944. = Cold War = In 1951 the 6th Armored Cavalry Regiment \\"Lancieri di Aosta\\" was raised in Reggio Emilia, which on 25 June 1952 received the regiment's flag with the regiment's traditions and decorations. Equipped with a mix of donated US Army armored fighting vehicles (M3 Scout Car, M8 Greyhound, M5 Stuart, M24 Chaffee, M47 Patton) the regiment was the armoured formation of the Infantry Division \\"Trieste\\" in Bologna until 20 October 1954, when the regiment was assigned to the VI Military Territorial Command. On 4 November 1958 the regiment returned to use its traditional name until it was disbanded on 31 August 1964, with its squadron groups used to form on 16 September 1964 two cavalry reconnaissance groups: the I Squadrons Group became the Squadrons Group \\"Lancieri di Aosta\\" in Cervignano del Friuli, while the II Squadrons Group moved from Reggio Emilia to Gradisca d'Isonzo and became the Squadrons Group \\"Cavalleggeri di Saluzzo\\". The Aosta joined the Infantry Division \\"Mantova\\" as divisional reconnaissance unit, while the regiment's flag was transferred to the Shrine of the Flags in the Vittoriano in Rome. During the 1975 army reform the Aosta was equipped with Leopard 1A2 main battle tanks, assigned to the Armored Brigade \\"Vittorio Veneto\\", renamed 6th Tank Squadrons Group \\"Lancieri di Aosta\\" and received the Aosta regiment's flag. For its conduct and work after the 1976 Friuli earthquake the squadrons group was awarded a Bronze Medal of Army Valour, which was affixed to the squadron group's war flag and added to the squadron group's coat of arms. = Recent times = On 7 May 1991 the regiment moved from Cervignano del Friuli to Palermo, where it joined the Motorized Brigade \\"Aosta\\". On 3 March 1993 the squadrons group was renamed as Regiment \\"Lancieri di Aosta\\" (6th) without changing size. Around the same time the regiment began to receive wheeled Centauro tank destroyers.  Current structure  As of 2019 the Regiment \\"Lancieri di Aosta\\" (6th) consists of: * 30px Regimental Command, in Palermo ** Command and Logistic Support Squadron ** 1st Reconnaissance Squadrons Group *** 1st Reconnaissance Squadron \\"Custoza\\" *** 2nd Reconnaissance Squadron \\"Novara\\" *** 3rd Reconnaissance Squadron \\"Corgnolo\\" *** Heavy Armor Squadron \\"Neghelli\\" The Command and Logistic Support Squadron fields the following platoons: C3 Platoon, Transport and Materiel Platoon, Medical Platoon, and Commissariat Platoon. The three reconnaissance squadrons are equipped with VTLM Lince vehicles and Centauro tank destroyers, the latter of which are scheduled to be replaced by Freccia reconnaissance vehicles. The Heavy Armor Squadron is equipped with Centauro tank destroyers, which are being replaced by Centauro II tank destroyers. With the introduction of the Freccia reconnaissance vehicles the reconnaissance squadrons will be reduced from three to two.

Life  Seo was born in 1951, in Changwon (formerly Masan), Gyeongsangnam-do. In her early years, she had a hard time longing for her mother before she began writing. While she attended Masan Girls High School, she participated in the club called Dotseom Literature and practiced her writing. She founded the Masan Sijo Literature Club in 1982 with Kim Gyo-han, Lee U-geol, Kim Bok-geun, Hong Jin-gi, Yang Gye-hyang, and others, and worked as a founding member . In 1990, her poem \\"Buksori (북소리, Drumming Sound)\\" won the sijo category of the Gyeongnam Ilbo New Writer's Contest (《경남신문》 신춘문예). Also, her poem \\"Bulkkotnori (불꽃놀이, Fireworks)\\" was recommended in the literary journal Sijomunhak, and her children's poem \\"Songeoul (손거울, Hand Mirror)\\" won the Korea Children's Literature New Writer's Contest (《한국아동문학연구》 신인상).

Writing  The most prominent feature of Seo's poetry is its detachment from the idealism of the traditional sijo, its realism. The realism of her poetry stems from her attempt to create her own unique sijo aesthetics that abides the syllabic verse rules and reflects the reality at the same time.Seo Il-ok, \\"My Sijo's Awareness of Time and Sense of Realism,\\" in Byeongsan Ucheguk (Seoul: Goyoachim, 2016). = From family to history = One of the most revisited subject matters in Seo's poetry is mother. \\"Mother's Room,\\" the second chapter of her poetry collection Geuneurui munui, includes poems related to mother: in \\"Eommaneun (엄마는, Mom),\\" the narrator depicts her mother who cannot recognize her granddaughter because of old age; \\"Eomeoni-ui bang (어머니의 방, Mother's Room)\\" tells the story of a daughter who is changing the diapers of her old mother; in \\"Bab (밥, Meal),\\" a mother, having grown up in a poor household, eats endlessly after getting ill.Seo Il-ok, \\"My Sijo's Awareness of Time and Sense of Realism,\\" in Byeongsan Ucheguk (Seoul: Goyoachim, 2016). The family stories described in Seo's poems are distinctive, because they are not just about her own life experience, but about the collective history. For example, in \\"Gotgam (곶감, Dried Persimmon),\\" an aunt, who had to see six of her children die, loses her last son to the Vietnam War\\"Vietnam War,\\" accessed November 18, 2019, https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=1101558&cid;=40942&categoryId;=33429., and with her story the poem develops the experience of an individual into a larger matter of history. In \\"Jirisan Gosamok (지리산 고사목, The Old Tree in Jirisan Mountain),\\" the narrator's father—a victim of the civilian massacre that occurred in Jirisan Mountain around the time of the Korean War—is described as a person who is trying to erase \\"the sad history\\" by never closing his eyes after death.

Bolivian Foreign Minister  Longaric at a Mercosur summit in Brazil. On 13 November 2019, she was named as Minister for Foreign Affairs. Her main focus since her appointment has been to boost and strengthen ties with other countries, especially with those where relations had been broken during the government of Evo Morales, such as the United States and Canada, while distancing Bolivia from strong allies of Morales. In of her first acts as minister, she announced an immediate rejection of the government of Nicolás Maduro and pledged support for the self-proclaimed President of Venezuela, Juan Guaidó. This new alignment was also signalled by her announcement of Bolivia's withdrawal from the ALBA group and subsequent joining of the Lima Group. On 15 November 2019, Longaric expelled 725 Cuban citizens, mostly medical doctors, after she raised concerns about their alleged involvement in protests. In January 2020, her ministry suspended relations with Cuba in response to remarks made by Cuban counterpart Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, who called Áñez a \\"liar,\\" \\"coupist\\" and \\"self-proclaimed\\" in reference to her latest statements about the role of Cuban medical doctors in the country.

Miyazaki painted his most popular fan designs on kimono, and they were wildly popular. He used rice paste to resist-dye the cloth in a method that he named yūzen-zome. It later became known as simply yūzen. This technique made it easier for Miyazaki to paint his designs directly on the kimonos, making them more expressive.

He is noted for his avant-garde, experimental poems in the literary world. He aims to write poetry that is completely different from any preexisting poems and has tried many experimental attempts, such as putting music (sound) and poetry together. Sung's major work is the poetry collection Rieul (ㄹ, Rieul). He is currently working as a professor of sound art.  Life  Sung was born in 1967 in Seoul, where he grew up.Kiwan Sung, \\"Essay: Shelter for the Flood Victims,\\" KIRA Monthly 592 (2018). His father is Sung Chan-kyeong, a poet and professor of English literature, whose 'willingness to experiment to the extreme' influenced him greatly.\\"Kiwan Sung,\\" Naver Terms, accessed November 18, 2019, https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=333541&cid;=41708&categoryId;=41737. He inherited from his father his enthusiasm towards strange and convoluted experiment on language that goes beyond the realm of a poetic style. He entered the Department of French Language and Literature, Seoul National University in 1986, and finished his doctor's degree there in 1996. His career as a poet began after his poems were published in the 1994 fall edition of the quarterly Segyeui Munhak. Since then he has been writing poetry, but also working in the music industry. He served as the music director of many TV series and films, including the MBC series Do It Your Way, and as the host of the EBS radio program Kiwan Sung's Journey into Music from 2005 to 2008. Sung was the leader of the band 3rd Line Butterfly and recorded many solo albums, such as Namuga doeneun beob (나무가 되는 법, How to Become a Tree) that came out in 1999 and Dangsinui norae (당신의 노래, Your Songs) in 2008. After leaving 3rd Line Butterfly, he has joined the group AASSA, short for Afro Asian SSound Act, and the sound archiving project group SSAP, Seoul Sound Archive Project. Sung has been working as a popular music critic, as well. He was an editor of the culture magazine/book Ida (이다, Ida).\\"Kiwan Sung,\\" wikipedia, accessed November 18, 2019, https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%84%B1%EA%B8%B0%EC%99%84.

He is currently teaching sound art as the professor of the Department of Intermedia Art, Kaywon University of Art and Design.  Writing  Sung's poetry is considered an innovative experiment that breaks taboos. His poems disregard the conventional poetry style and show such unique arrangements of words: for example, one of his poems reminds its readers of online chats. The poet intentionally juxtaposes words that have no relations to one another, defying common sense. His viewpoint is that noise and music are not different, so he focuses on the raw material and noise, or noise poetry, which means a poetry which comes from noise, completed through making fragmentary sounds.Kim Seul-gi, \\"Kiwan Sung and Jin Eun-yeong Publish New Books After 4 Years,\\" Maeil Business, August 17, 2012, https://www.mk.co.kr/news/culture/view/2012/08/520013. His first poetry collection, Shoping gatda osimnigga (쇼핑 갔다 오십니까, Did You Go Shopping), published in 1998, deals with the features of the digital age like the internet. In the poem \\"A, B, C, D, E, F, geurigo X ui norae (A, B, C, D, E, F, 그리고 X의 노래, The song of A, B, C, D, E, F, and X),\\" digital signals wipe out the specific realities of individuals and refer to them by symbols. As the digital age reincarnates them as symbols instead of alienating them, it is not wasteful but productive.Roh Cheol, \\"On the Poems of the Contemporary Digital Age: Focusing on Kiwan Sung's Shoping gatda osimnigga,\\" Korean Language and Literature in International Context 23 (2001). The three main words of his second poetry collection, Yuri iyagi (유리 이야기, Story of Glass), published in 2003, are 'green rubber monster,' 'glass,' and 'me.' They all represent the poet, his divided selves. 48 poems with a series of numbers as titles—63 stories including the epilogue—are dreamy and fantastic. All the poems are not finished; however, when regarding all the 63 poems as one story, they become a sort of novel. The purpose of such organization is to create a whole new rhythm for the poems and this poetry collection, which is totally different from the rhythm of any preexisting poetry.Kim Tae-hwan, \\"Erased Stories\\", in Yuri iyagi (Seoul: Moonji, 2003). Dangsinui tekseuteu (당신의 텍스트, Your Text), his third poetry collection published in 2008, is mostly made up of noise. The poet explains that, when paying attention to noise with senses other than the sense of hearing, one can enjoy it as music. The title poem \\"Dangsinui tekseuteu,\\" by repeating the words \\"your text\\" and \\"me,\\" separates the relationship between 'you' and the 'text' and 'me.' In the poem \\"Hwanghon, myeokrasu (황혼, 멱라수, Dusk, the River of Mishui),\\" the narrator is woman, unlike Sung's other poems, and she talks about the love that has no answers, the love of the body.\\"Hwanghon, myeokrasu,\\" Naver Terms, accessed November 18, 2019, https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=3568454&cid;=58824&categoryId;=58837. His fourth poetry collection Rieul, published in 2012, is only composed of sounds. This work is based on sound art, which is the creative activity that uses sound without any limits. It was published with an album of two CDs entitled Sonicwallpaper4poetrybook. The album is for the book and vice versa, but they can be enjoyed in both independent and interrelated ways. The aim of the work is to ruminate over the meaning of the frivolous noise and music in daily life, and to give a new meaning to the sounds that have been considered noise and kitsch, such as sign boards, daily conversations, tweets , and commercials.\\"[MUSICIAN] Kiwan Sung, Poet Who Collects Sounds: Archiving New Sounds of Daily Lives,\\" Travie, November 6, 2011, http://www.travie.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=16299.

Sleep duration and quality reduce to suboptimal levels, and sleep duration variability and latency increases during adolescence. Sleep recommendations suggest that adolescents should obtain 8-10 hours of sleep per night. Additionally, there is a shift in the body's circadian rhythm such that sleep and wake timings become later during adolescence. Technology, social factors, and physical development are thought to contribute to poor sleep during this time. Poor sleep duration and quality in adolescents has been linked with altered brain functioning and development, poor mental and physical health, as well as higher rates of disease and mortality. The concerns surrounding poor sleep during adolescence has garnered significant public attention, especially concerning policies related to school start times.  Developmental changes  Adolescent sleep worsens with age. Specifically, longitudinal research demonstrates that sleep duration shortens during the transition from high school to college. Additionally, sleep efficiency (the amount of time spent asleep when in bed) decreased during this transition. Day-to-day variability in sleep duration increased during this transition, suggesting that adolescent sleep duration becomes less stable with time. A variety of social, physical, biological, and psychological factors change during adolescence which contributes to declines in sleep. In particular, puberty has been explored as a contributor to changes in adolescent sleep. Luteinizing hormone (LH) is secreted during sleep at the onset of pubertal maturation, pointing to a important relationship between sleep and pubertal development.  Sleep recommendations  The National Sleep Foundation recommends that teenagers (14–17 years) obtain 8 to 10 hours of sleep. Their recommendation further stipulates that less than 7 hours and more than 11 hours of sleep may be harmful. Additionally, it is recommended that young adults (18–25 years) obtain 7 to 9 hours of sleep and avoid sleep less than 6 hours and more than 11 hours. Adolescent sleep researchers have conducted studies to provide stronger empirical evidence for sleep recommendations. Fuligni and colleagues (2019) examined a sample of American adolescents and found that younger adolescents, especially those with elevated levels of internalizing symptoms, need more sleep in order to experience optimum levels of positive mood the next day. Additionally, another study examining Mexican-American youth found that roughly 7.5 hours of sleep was predictive of high GPA but 8.75 hours of sleep was predictive of lower internalizing symptoms. This finding suggests that optimal sleep duration differs depending on the outcome. More research is needed to understand individual differences in sleep duration during adolescence.  Sleep duration  Sleep duration has been declining since the early 90s according to research. Evidence also suggests that teen females, ethnic minorities, and those of low socioeconomic status experience the lowest durations. Puberty is thought to contribute to poor sleep during adolescence as teens undergo physical and social maturation. A burgeoning area of adolescent sleep research is focused on understanding the contribution of technology-use to poor teen sleep. Importantly, research shows that declines in adolescent sleep duration are characteristic of adolescents around the world. = Brain = Poor sleep duration has been found to be related to altered brain development during adolescence. Telzer and colleagues (2015) found that teens with greater day-to-day variability in their sleep duration had lower white matter integrity one year later. This result remained when controlling for sleep duration, which suggests that sleep variability may be more consequential for teen brain development than simply duration. Another study found that sleep duration was strongly associated with gray matter volume of the bilateral hippocampus among a sample of healthy children and adolescents. = Risk-taking = Poor sleep duration and increased risk-taking has been a well-established association in the adolescent sleep literature. A recent meta-analysis reported that poor sleep duration results in a 1.43 times greater odds of engaging in risky behaviors. The direction of the relationship between risk-taking and sleep duration is still unknown, thus causal claims cannot be made. = Emotion = A plethora of research shows that low sleep duration is linked with poor mood. Furthermore, youth who report low sleep duration also demonstrate difficulties with emotion regulation. This is of particular concern because adolescents experience fluctuations in mood as a result of pubertal maturation, however, poor sleep duration worsens mood and regulation abilities rendering these adolescents vulnerable.  Sleep quality  Empirical evidence suggests that sleep quality is poor during adolescence. Poor sleep quality during adolescence has been linked with a variety of negative behaviors and outcomes. For instance, poor sleep quality has been shown to be positive associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms among teens. A study published in 2016 found that sleep quality significantly mediated the relationship between age and depressive symptoms, suggesting that the rise in depressive symptoms during adolescence is partly explained by poor sleep quality. A long line of research has also demonstrated that poor sleep quality is associated with increased risk-taking behaviors among teens. Neuroscience research (fMRI) has found that poor sleep quality is associated with greater risk-taking on a behavioral task. This risky behavior was further associated with decreased activity in cognitive control regions of the brain and increased activity in reward regions of the brain. Moreover, poor sleep quality has been found to be linked with dampened intra-network connectivity of regions in the Default Mode Network, a brain network that undergoes development during adolescence.  Technology  There has been an increased interest in understanding the relationship between sleep and technology use among adolescents. In the era of social media, there is a growing concern for blue-light emitted by technology may be interfering with adolescents' ability to obtain restful and sufficient sleep. Use of technologies (i.e. television, cell phone, computer/laptop) is associated with prolonged sleep duration (the amount of time it takes to fall asleep) and shorter sleep duration among teenagers. Television use was associated with the poorest sleep duration. Adolescent technology-use has also been linked with excessive daytime sleepiness and caffeine consumption, suggesting that technology-use may interfere with sleep and may lead to increased caffeine consumption. Longitudinal data demonstrates that time spent using technology is predictive of short sleep duration, however short sleep duration was also predictive of time spent using technology. More longitudinal research with larger sample sizes is needed to clarify the mechanisms underlying the association between technology-use and sleep during adolescence.  Chronotype  Adolescence is characterized by an evening chronotype preference with adolescents engaging in late bed and wake times. An evening chronotype is unique to the period of adolescence compared to childhood and adulthood which are characterized by a morning chronotype. Eveningness during adolescence is linked with increased substance use, worse overall mood, poor diet, increased depressive symptoms, increased anxiety symptoms, and poor emotion regulation. Beyond conveying bed and wake times, chronotype is also indicative of optimal times of functioning. For instance, researchers tested adolescents on their executive functioning performance at two times: once at a time that is optimal for chronotype (i.e. evening for evening chronotypes vs. morning for morning chronotypes) and once at a time that is suboptimal for chronotype (i.e. morning for evening chronotypes vs. evening for morning chronotypes). They found that morning adolescents tested in the morning performed better than in the evening, and evening chronotype adolescents tested in the evening performed better than in the morning.  Sleep measures  = Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index = The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a well-validated and widely used self-report questionnaire that measures sleep quality. Nineteen items are combined to create seven component scores of sleep, and those component scores are then used to create an overall “global score” of sleep quality. The seven components consist of subjective sleep quality, sleep disturbances, sleep duration, sleep latency, habitual sleep efficiency, use of sleep medications, and daytime dysfunction. The PSQI has a high internal reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.83).https://consultgeri.org/try-this/general- assessment/issue-6.1.pdf The PSQI has been used in many studies assessing adolescent sleep quality. = Actigraphy = Actigraph watches are commonly used to gather objective measures of sleep. The watch is worn on the non- dominant wrist and measures sleep using body movement. Data gathered from the watch includes sleep duration, number of awakenings, total minutes of nighttime awakenings, and latency. = Morningness Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) = The first valid and reliable measure of chronotype was created by Horne and Östberg (1976): Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) contains 19 items tapping sleep and wake time preferences. Sample items include “Assuming adequate environmental conditions, how easy do you find getting up in the mornings?” and “Considering your own ‘feeling best’ rhythm, at what time would you get up if you were entirely free to plan your day?”. The questionnaire consists of both Likert and timescale items, and items are scored to obtain a composite score. Since its creation, the MEQ has been validated in some adolescent and young adult samples. Early assessments of this questionnaire’s psychometric properties revealed that the scale has good internal consistency (a = .82).

Construction  SS Robert E. Lee was built in Newport News, Virginia and finished construction in 1924. The ship had a keel length of , a beam length of and a depth of . The ship was constructed to primarily transport passengers between Virginia and New York.  History  A Type IXC U-boat similar to U-166 In February 1942 Robert E. Lee was chartered by the Alcoa Steamship Company to transport goods and personnel from New York to ports located in the Caribbean. One month later, in March 1942 she was contracted by the War Shipping Administration as a freight carrier and was subsequently armed with a stern gun and degaussed to prevent magnetic mine attacks.  Sinking  On 30 July 1942, Robert E. Lee left Trinidad with around 270 passengers bound for Tampa, Florida. She initially traveled with convoy TAW-7 but was soon diverted to New Orleans along with the submarine chaser . At 22:37 a single torpedo was fired at the ship by . The torpedo was spotted by lookouts away but no evasive action was able to be taken. The torpedo struck just aft of the engine room and destroyed the #3 hold. Further damage was also done to the radio compartment and the steering gear. The ship began to list to port and then starboard before finally sinking by the stern approximately 15 minutes after the torpedo hit.

CDL has developed many types of properties from shopping malls to integrated developments.  History  City Developments Limited was founded on 7 September 1963 as a property company, initially starting with eight employees in Amber Mansions on Orchard Road. The company subsequently listed on the Malayan Stock Exchange (present-day Singapore Exchange) in November the same year. When the company first started, it built its first project in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, a 200-unit bungalow development called Fresh Breezes, which was completed in 1965. With Fresh Breezes, CDL introduced the concept of \\"show house\\" as a sales technique, which was \\"believed to be unique in Asia\\". It allows prospective buyers to preview how a property would look like before committing themselves to buy the property. It proceeded to build its second project in Johor Bahru called Marine Vista, a project that has expansive views of the Straits of Johor. CDL built its first Singapore project called City Towers in Bukit Timah, which was completed in 1966. This was said to be Singapore's first high-rise project. It also built Singapore's first condo project the same year called Clementi Park. CDL was unprofitable for its first seven years' of operations, with the race riots in 1969 and withdrawal of British troops from Singapore affecting the property markets in Malaysia and Singapore. Thus, CDL was forced to sell its properties in Johor Bahru and consolidated itself into the Singapore market. Hong Leong Group began to invest in CDL in 1969, buying a substantial stake which allowed them to place three directors on CDL's board. In 1972, Kwek Leng Beng, then an executive in Hong Leong Group, led an acquisition of a controlling stake in CDL, transforming CDL into the core publicly traded entity of Hong Leong Group. Kwek later became the managing director of CDL in 1974, and the executive chairman in 1995 after the death of his father, Kwek Hong Png. Riding on the strong economic growth which transformed Singapore into an industrialised nation, CDL grew rapidly with a market capitalisation of in 1995. Its flagship building, the Republic Plaza, was officially opened on 18 January 1998 by then Prime Minister of Singapore Goh Chok Tong. With Hong Leong Group's investments into CDL, CDL's industrial properties was offloaded into Hong Leong Holdings, a subsidiary of Hong Leong Group. It then diversified into hospitality industry through the establishment of CDL Hotels International (CDLHI) in 1989. CDLHI acquired hotel properties across Asia, Europe, and United States. Millennium & Copthorne Hotels (M&C;) was eventually floated London Stock Exchange (LSE) in 1996, and more hotel properties and brands were acquired and consolidated under M&C.; M&C; also would come to manage hotels owned by other firms across the world. As part of a restructuring exercise in 1999, CDLHI renamed to City e-Solutions Limited in 2000 with a focus on CDL's efforts to develop hospitality related Internet businesses and other e-commerce business initiatives in various industries. CDL weathered through a recession that Singapore slid into in 2008 as an effect of the Great Recession. Its financial performance was affected by its exposure to the Sterling Pound, as the Singapore dollar had strengthened against it, via its United Kingdom-centric M&C.; However, it managed to remain one of the largest real estate development firms in Singapore post recession. In June 2019, M&C;'s board agreed to recommend a takeover offer, valuing the business at £2.23 billion, from CDL for the shares it does not already own. The transaction became unconditional in September 2019. M&C; was delisted from LSE on 11 October 2019, and effectively making M&C; a full subsidiary of CDL. = Sustainability and social efforts = CDL formalised its sustainability efforts in 1995 with the adoption of its ethos Conversing as we Construct. In 2003, CDL established its corporate environment, health and safety policy. It then acquired ISO 14001 certification (Environmental Management System) from the local governing authority, Building and Construction Authority (BCA) in the same year. It subsequently acquired certifications in ISO 50001 – Energy Management System in 2014, and ISO 14064-1 – on quantification and reporting greenhouse gas inventory in 2016, ahead of its competitors in the property development industry. In 1998, CDL became the first developer to install energy saving lifts, which allowed up to 50% savings of energy usage, in a residential property project, the Florida Executive Condominium. It also installed twin- chute pneumatic refuse collection system in selected condominiums, where refuse and recyclables, disposed separately at residents' doorsteps, being transported to a central collection area. In 2009, CDL developed the 11 Tampines Concourse, Asia's first CarbonNeutral development, and City Square Mall, Singapore's first \\"eco-mall\\" with a number of eco-friendly facilities. In 2012, CDL sought to retrofit Republic Plaza, and upgraded its BCA Green Mark category from Gold to Platinum in the process. Its retrofits included an upgraded chiller plant, energy efficient lights, and motion sensors to reduce energy wastage. In 2017, CDL issued a green bond to repay a loan for the retrofitting efforts, the first such bond in Singapore. In 2008, CDL adopted Global Reporting Initiative's reporting framework for its sustainability report, becoming the first in Singapore to do so, which eventually was given an A+ rating in 2012's edition. In the same year, CDL also had started disclosing its carbon emissions with the Carbon Disclosure Project publicly, making it the first Singaporean company to do so. CDL would eventually score itself A grades in 2019. In 2019, according to Corporate Knights, CDL had the second highest score in terms of sustainability in Asia Pacific. In 2020, the company was ranked third. Reasons for this included increase in energy usage. In addition, CDL was one of the first companies in Singapore to be recognised for gender equality efforts along with DBS Bank in the first Bloomberg Gender- Equality Index (GEI) published in 2018.  Group structure  , CDL reported having 248 subsidiaries, 53 associated companies, 12 trusts and 6 limited partnerships. = Notable subsidiaries =  CBM  Established in 1971, CBM Pte Ltd provided in-house engineering, cleaning and security services for CDL's properties. In 2007, capitalising on the capabilities in relation to facilities management gained over the years, CBM began taking on contracts from external clients across different sectors, such as Ministry of Defence and Ministry of Home Affairs. CBM also had established presence in Qatar, Thailand, and Taiwan. In 2011, CBM extended itself into developing carpark equipment for commercial and government owned carparks in Singapore, then carpark management services in Taiwan in 2014.  Millennium & Copthorne Hotels  CDL had diversified its property investments after being controlled by Hong Leong Group, beginning with the establishment of CDL Hotels International (CDLHI) in 1989. Through CDLHI, CDL purchased hotels first within the Asian region, then further acquisitions in United States and Europe. With its acquired hotels being renamed to include the Millennium brand, CDLHI established the Millennium Hotels And Resorts global brand in 1995. On 8 October 1995, Aer Lingus sold the Copthorne Hotels to CDL for . Millennium & Copthorne Hotels (M&C;) was eventually floated London Stock Exchange (LSE) in 1996 and more hotel properties and brands were acquired and consolidated under M&C.; Concurrently, CDLHI became City e-Solutions Limited to focus on hospitality related Internet businesses. M&C; also would come to manage hotels owned by other firms across the world. In 2019, CDL took M&C; private, turning M&C; a wholly owned subsidiary. = Notable partnerships = In 2018, CDL and CapitaLand teamed up as a consortium for the Sengkang Central tender, which they eventually won with a top bid of S$777.8 million. Details of the development were released the following year with completion by 2022, being a 3.7-hectare mixed-use development next to Buangkok MRT station with a three-storey mall, a hawker centre and childcare centre, a community club which will be Singapore's largest and a 680-unit condominium. The condo and mall have since been named the Sengkang Grand Residences and Sengkang Grand Mall. In 2019, CDL became involved in a consortium with CapitaLand and Ascott Residence Trust to redevelop the strata titles that Liang Court shopping mall and its adjacent buildings, a hotel and a serviced apartment, are on into an integrated development of a shopping mall, hotel, serviced apartments, and private residential towers. CDL and CapitaLand came to own Liang Court after a purchase in the same year.  Notable projects  CDL's portfolio includes these notable projects: = Integrated developments = CDL's integrated developments include King's Centre, Sunshine Plaza, Quayside Isle @ Sentosa Cove, and South Beach Tower. Current projects in progress include the redevelopment of Liang Court, which will be completed in stages from 2024, as well as an integrated complex in Buangkok by 2022. = Shopping malls = CDL boasts a wide array of malls, including Katong Shopping Centre, Palais Renaissance, Tanglin Shopping Centre, Delfi Orchard, and City Square Mall. It also used to manage Lot One and Chinatown Point before being sold to CapitaLand and Perennial (Singapore) Retail Management respectively. = Hotels = Majority of CDL's hotels are operated under the Millennium & Copthorne Hotels brand, which spans across many countries around the world. Other hotels owned by CDL include The St. Regis Singapore, W Singapore Sentosa Cove, JW Marriott hotel in South Beach and Millennium Hilton Bangkok in Thailand. = Offices = CDL's office portfolio include City House (which was its former headquarters before moving to Republic Plaza), The Arcade, Fuji Xerox Towers, Fortune Centre, and Republic Plaza. = Homes = CDL's homes portfolio include The Sail @ Marina Bay, One Shenton Way, and Sentosa Cove.

He spent most of his career in Peru. Some sources give his year of death as 1830. Life and work His father was the painter Pedro del Pozo (died 1785), who was appointed Director of the Real Escuela de Tres Nobles Artes in 1775. His original studies were at that institution and, ten years later, upon his father's death, José was chosen to succeed him, with reduced responsibilities. Malaspina Expedition In 1789, Alessandro Malaspina, before departing from Cádiz, asked , a member of the Council of Castile, to find a young painter would could accompany him on the expedition. De Bruna had been a friend of José's father, so he recommended him. The expedition's first stop was at Montevideo, where the artists produced drawings of the plant and animal species. Two (of plants) are signed by him and are currently preserved at the Museo Naval de Madrid. They also possess two of his watercolors, depicting Puerto Deseado; the first paintings made in Argentina. He produced numerous drawings of landscapes and people in Patagonia, and several portraits of indigenous people were later sent to King Carlos IV from Callao. By 1790, they had reached the port of Talcahuano, then went on to Concepción, Valparaíso and Santiago.José del Pozo, Segunda vista de Santiago de Chile, Archivo Visual de Santiago, 1790. Lima Despite the support of Malaspina, he was dismissed from the expedition before it left Callao. No reason has ever been ascertained. However, the new Viceroy of Peru, Francisco Gil de Taboada, was an acquaintance of his, so he decided to stay in Lima rather than return to Spain.Puig-Samper (2012) Soon, he founded an art school and devoted himself to painting portraits of prominent people, as well as creating some religious works. He died there, sometime around 1821, but certainly before 1830; possibly from causes related to the Peruvian War of Independence.

It is the second-highest point of the Fitzsimmons Range, which is a subset of the Garibaldi Ranges. It is situated southeast of Whistler, and its nearest higher peak is Overlord Mountain, to the northwest. The Benvolio Glacier is set on the western slope of the peak, the Diavolo Glacier spreads out below the eastern aspect of the summit, and the Fitzsimmons Glacier descends the north slope. Precipitation runoff from the peak and meltwater from its glaciers drains into tributaries of the Cheakamus River. History The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1923 by Phyllis Munday and Don Munday via the Benvolio Glacier. The peak was named in 1964 by a climbing party from the Alpine Club of Canada to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the birth of William Shakespeare. Viewed from the north, this peak stands out between Overlord Mountain and Mount Fitzsimmons, however its beauty from afar is somewhat dulled close up. Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet had a character named Benvolio who shared similar traits. The mountain's name was officially adopted on August 27, 1965, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Climate Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Benvolio is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Mount Benvolio.

In Yi's poetry, an individual's wound is associated with the historical situations at that time and becomes the problems of the Korean community as a whole.  Life  Yi was born in 1914 in Kyongsong, North Hamgyong Province, in what is today North Korea, to a merchant who smuggled salt. He lost his father at an early age and grew up in deep grinding poverty.“Yi Yongak,” I am Literature https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=955834&cid;=60538&categoryId;=60538 In 1932, while in fourth grade in Gyeongseong agricultural school, Yi transferred to a middle school in Hiroshima in Japan.

In November 1945, he started working as a reporter of Joongangshinmum for a year. After he joined the Workers' Party of South Korea in 1947, Yi became a key member of the Seoul branch of the Federation of Korean Cultural Organizations. Yi was arrested in 1949 and sent to Seodaemun Prison due to the cultural event by the Workers’ Party in Seoul in February 1950. When the North Korean Army seized Seoul at the beginning of the Korean War, Yi was released from Seodaemun. He then served as publicity manager of the Federation of South Korean Writers before finally defecting to North Korea. From 1951 to 1952, Yi, served on the central committee of the Federation of Korean Cultural Organizations in North Korea.

Along with Pak Inhwan, Kim Suyeong and Kim Jongsam, he represents the post-war modernist movement.  Life  He was born in 1928 in Anju, South Pyeongan Province. He became interested in literature after his brother Jeon Bongrae recommended that he read The Sorrows of Young Werther (German: Die Leiden des jungen Werthers) when he was a middle school student. Jeon Bonggeon said that the writers who impressed him the most was Rilke and Baudelaire. He wanted to be a novelist, but because of the illness he suffered from in his early teens, he became enervated and began to write poems, instead. As he was taught in Japanese during the colonial period, he had difficulty writing in Korean right after Korea became independent. He debuted in 1950 through Munye (문예 Literature) with the help of Seo Jeongju and Kim Yeongrang..Jo, Hwaseon. \\"Commentary: Orpheus Has His Harp Back,\\" A Hundred of the Suns, Kipeunsaem, 2008; 185. With the recommendation of Seo Jeongju, \\"Won (원 Circle)\\" in January and \\"Sawol (사월 April)\\" in March were published and Kim Yeongrang recommended \\"Chukdo (축도 Benediction)\\" in May. The first recommended work was published under the name of Jeon Bongrae, his brother. The editors of Munye changed the writer’s name because they underestimated Jeon bonggeon, thinking he was not capable of writing the poem. When the Korean War broke out, he joined the military in December. and was discharged after he was injured during the battle on the middle east front in 1951. After the discharge, he started writing poems in Daegu. While he helped Hwang Hunheon with arranging records at the famous classical music hall, \\"Renaissance,\\"Heo, Manha. \\"Melody of Autumn in 1951,\\" Webzine Daesan Munhwa, 2005. The name of the classical music hall is \\"Renaissance,\\" which was popular among writers during the war. http://www.daesan.or.kr/webzine/sub.html?uid=304&section;=sc8&section2;=&ho;=15 he got acquainted with literary people. After the Korean War was over in 1953, he returned to Seoul. He participated in establishing the Society of Korean Poets in 1957 and he edited and published the first issue of a magazine, Hyeondaesi (현대시 Modern Poetry). Along with Kim Kwangrim and Kim Jongsam, he published a multi-authored poetry collection, titled, Jeonjaengkwa eumakkwa heemangkwa (전쟁과 음악과 희망과 With War, With Music, and With Hope) in 1957. Kim Kwangrim, Kim Jongsam and Jeon Bonggeon wrote \\"With the War,\\" \\"With Music,\\" and \\"With Hope\\" respectively. In 1959, his first collection, Sarangeul wihan doipuli (사랑을 위한 되풀이 Repetition for Love) was published. In 1962, he joined a literary coterie, Hyeondaisi, and edited its magazine. He served as a chief editor for Munhakchunchu (문학춘추 Literature Spring and Autumn), founded in 1964. In addition, he started to write a radio play script and a historical play, Kkotsora (꽃소라 Flower Horned Turban), was published in 1964. He launched a magazine, Hyondaesihak (현대시학 Modern Poetics) in 1969, and served as a chief editor until he passed away. He suffered from his chronic illness, diabetes, which got worse in 1987 and he died on June 13, 1988. In October, 2015, the Modern Poetics established the Jeon Bonggeon Literary Award.  Writing  = Poetic language = His poems display vivid images and dynamic imagination which were rare in poetry in the 1950s. With his distinguished sense of language, he got nicknames such as a \\"language technician\\" or \\"language stylist.\\". His extraordinary sense of language was associated with how he organized an image. One of his representative works is \\"Piano (피아노 Piano)\\"Published in the May issue of Generation in 1959. where music is transformed through the words like \\"fresh fish\\" or \\"knife blade\\" into a wide variety of senses. = War poetry in the 1950s = His poetry in the 1950s depicts inhumane irrationality of the war and desire for peace. The poems written based on the war do not show either an anti-communist ideology or superficial humanism. Instead of exaggerating cruelty, his poems describe human beings that become objects. or convey determination to heal the wounds of the war.. = Long Poems and Serial Poetry in the 1960s = His poems released in the 1960s describe inner world through surrealistic representations. Both Chunghayngyeonga (춘향연가 Chunhyang's Love Poem), a long poem published in 1967, and Sokui bada (속의 바다 The Ocean of the Inside), serial poetry, published in 1970, express a fantastically surreal atmosphere. Chunhyang’s Love Poem borrows the situation of her in jail from the classic, The Tale of Chunhyang. This poem highlights erotic love. saying that love is so powerful that it can overcome irrationality of the reality. He continues to explore the power of Eros in The Ocean of the Inside. where opposite themes are repeated such as male and female; fertility and sterility; and life and death. There is a conflict between a mythical and prototypical world and a sterile real world and the narrator dreams of the mythical world.. = Piri (피리 Pipe) (1979) = Awarded the Korean Literary Award, Pipe well displays Jeon's characteristics of pursuing the spirituality and purity of fairy tales in the 1970s. His serial poetry, \\"Makaroni Westeon (마카로니 웨스턴 Macaroni Western)\\" describes rampant materialistic values and impoverished spiritual life that prevailed throughout the 1970s. With the repetitive image of death, it is as if life gives way to death.. However, for him, it is the task of a poet to show resilient life,Jeon, Bonggeon. \\"A Poet Speaks – The Language of Dream and Pain,\\" Pipe, 1979;2. and in that way, Pipe represents hope, life and birth. = Poems in the 1980s = During the 1980s, Jeon pursued harmonious communication between self and the world. Another serial poetry, Dol (돌 Stones), starting to be released in 1981, was written based on his own experiences of collecting viewing stones around the Namhangang River.. A stone in the poem \\"Stones\\" (1984) is not just a passive object but a living thing trying to express itself.. After the mid-1980s, he published a series of poems titled \\"6.25,\\" based on the subject of the Korean War, but he could not finish it. This poetry deals with the matter of the North and the South Koreas with the political ideology put aside.. = Revision = Jeon has never written any poem at one sitting. For him, revision was pleasure and he repeated revision.. He revised his own work that had been published in a literary magazine to publish it in a separate form and even revised a poem in a collection to republish it in an anthology. He also revised his review on a magazine to publish it in a book form. = Dispute with Kim Suyeong = In February, through \\"Sagiron (사기론 Fraud)\\" in Sedae (세대, Generation), Jeon criticized a review Kim Suyeong wrote in Sasanggye (사상계 The World of Thoughts) in December 1964.. Jeon said that he gave credit for Kim but his theory was not applicable to his own poems and the poems he advocated were nonsense.. To respond, Kim explained himself through \\"Munmaekeul moreuneun siindeul (문맥을 모르는 시인들 Poets Who Don’t Know Context)\\" in the March issue of Sedae. After that, by publishing \\"Chamyeoraneungeot (참여라는 것 What It Means To Participate)\\" in Hyeondaemunhak (현대문학 Modern Literature) in November, 1966, Jeon pointed out the contradictions of the kind of poetry that deals with socio-political matters.Jeon, Bonggeon. \\"What It Means to Participate\\", Selected Reviews of Jeon Bonggeon, Munhakseon, 2015: 382.

The regiment was the only Guide cavalry unit of the Savoyard state and later the Kingdom of Italy. Today the regiment is the reconnaissance unit of the Bersaglieri Brigade \\"Garibaldi\\".  History  On 7 April 1859 the Royal Sardinian Army raised its first Squadron of Guides, tasked with relaying messages between the army's headquarters and the divisions. Only weeks after its founding the squadron was employed in the Second Italian War of Independence. On 23 February 1860 the Regiment of Guides () was formed with the Sardinian Squadron of Guides, the Squadron of Guides of the Emilian Army, Lombardian troops, who had served in the Austrian Cavalry, and troops and officers drawn from existing Sardinian cavalry regiments. During the Third Italian War of Independence the regiment's four squadrons participated in the Battle of Custoza, for which the regiment was awarded a Silver Medal of Military Valour. In the following years the regiment changed name repeatedly, becoming the 19th Cavalry Regiment (Guides) in 1871, the Guides Cavalry Regiment (19th) in 1876, and the Regiment Cavalleggeri Guide (19th) on 16 December 1897. In 1911-12 the regiment's 2nd and 4th Squadron participated in the Italo-Turkish War. = World War I = At the outbreak of World War I the regiment formed the 737th and 738th machine gun companies, which together with the four regular squadrons of the regiment fought on the Italian front: first in 1915 on the Karst Plateau, then in 1916 in Monfalcone. In 1917, during the Italian retreat after the Battle of Caporetto, the regiment's cavalry squadrons delayed the enemy around San Vito al Tagliamento, while the two machine gun companies defended the bridge at Lucinico over the Isonzo, and then the bridge at Casarsa della Delizia over the Tagliamento; actions which aided the escape of the 3rd Army to the new Piave river front. After the Battle of Vittorio Veneto the regiment advanced through the breach in the Austrian lines liberating Sacile and Cordenons, before stopping in Pozzuolo del Friuli, when the Armistice of Villa Giusti came into effect. For the regiment's conduct at Monfalcone and for the liberation of Sacile the regiment was awarded a Bronze Medal of Military Valour. After the war the Italian cavalry was reduced in size and the regiment was disbanded in 1919 with its squadrons forming the II Squadrons Group of the Regiment \\"Cavalleggeri di Foggia\\" (11th). Already one year later the Foggia regiment was disbanded and the Regiment \\"Cavalleggeri Guide\\" reformed. To bring the regiment back to full strength it received the two squadrons of the disbanded Regiment \\"Cavalleggeri di Vicenza\\" (24th), which had joined the Regiment \\"Cavalleggeri di Saluzzo\\" (12th) a year earlier. = World War II = In 1934 the regiment became the army's Fast Tanks School Regiment () and began to raise groups equipped L3/33 tankettes: * I Fast Tanks Group \\"San Marco\\" (1st, 2nd, and 3rd Squadron, formed 5 January 1934) * II Fast Tanks Group \\"San Giusto\\" (4th, 5th, and 6th Squadron, formed 5 April 1934) * III Fast Tanks Group \\"San Martino\\" (7th, 8th, and 9th Squadron, formed 25 June 1934) The regiment also retained the Mounted Squadrons Group \\"San Giorgio\\" with two squadrons of cavalry, which was officially activated on formed 5 January 1934. In 1935 the three fast tank groups were ceded to the army's three fast divisions: 1st \\"Eugenio di Savoia\\", 2nd \\"Emanuele Filiberto Testa di Ferro\\", and 3rd \\"Principe Amedeo Duca d'Aosta\\". Each of the three fast divisions fielded two cavalry regiments and the Fast Tanks School Regiment raised six fast tank squadrons, one for each of the remaining six cavalry regiments: \\"Nizza Cavalleria\\" (1st), \\"Piemonte Reale Cavalleria\\" (2nd), \\"Genova Cavalleria\\" (4th), \\"Lancieri di Aosta (6th), \\"Cavalleggeri di Monferrato\\" (13th), and one for the Fast Tanks School Regiment itself. However with the Second Italo-Ethiopian War looming the six squadrons were used to form the IV Fast Tanks Group \\"Duca degli Abruzzi\\" and the V Fast Tanks Group \\"Baldissera\\", which both saw combat in Ethiopia. At the outbreak of the World War II the regiment was sent to Albania, where it participated in the disastrous Greco-Italian War. For its conduct during the initial Italian offensive and the following Greek counter-offensive the regiment was awarded its second Bronze Medal of Military Valour. The regiment remained in Albania for the remainder of the war and dissolved after Italy had switched sides with the Armistice of Cassibile. On 30 November 1940 the XIV Group on foot \\"Cavalleggeri Guide\\" was raised from reserve personnel and assigned to the 210th Coastal Division in Salento. After the Armistice of Cassibile the unit was reorganized as 14th Combat Supply Unit \\"Guide\\" by the Italian Co-belligerent Army and served in the Italian liberation campaign. = Cold War = On 1 April 1949 in Tor di Quinto the unit was reformed as Armored Cavalry Squadron \\"Guide\\", which within the same year moved to Casarsa della Delizia, where it joined the Armored Brigade \\"Ariete\\". In December 1953 the unit was renamed Squadrons Group \\"Cavalleggeri Guide\\" and in 1958 Squadrons Group \\"Cavalleggeri Guide\\" (19th). In 1963 the squadrons group was sent to Longarone to help rescue efforts after the Vajont dam disaster. For its conduct in Longarone the squadrons group was awarded a Silver Medal of Civil Valor. During the Italian Army 1975 reform the unit's name was changed to 19th Squadrons Group \\"Cavalleggeri Guide\\" and it received the flag of the Regiment \\"Cavalleggeri Guide\\" (19th), which until then had been stored at the Shrine of the Flags in the Vittoriano in Rome. For its conduct and work after the 1976 Friuli earthquake the battalion was awarded a Silver Medal of Army Valour, which was affixed to the battalion's war flag and added to the battalion's coat of arms. In 1986 the Armored Division \\"Ariete\\" was disbanded and the squadrons group passed to the 32nd Armored Brigade \\"Mameli\\". = Recent times = On 1 April 1991 the Mameli brigade was disbanded and the squadrons group moved from Casarsa della Delizia to Salerno in the South of Italy, where it joined the Bersaglieri Brigade \\"Garibaldi\\". On 5 August of the same year the squadrons group was renamed 19th Regiment \\"Cavalleggeri Guide\\" without changing size or composition. On 2 August 1992 the regiment returned to its traditional name Regiment \\"Cavalleggeri Guide\\" (19th) and became one of the first units to fully professionalize. In 1992 the regiment participated in the international Unified Task Force and UNOSOM II missions in Somalia. In December 1998 the regiment was deployed to North Macedonia for a possible NATO-led ground invasion of Kosovo during the Kosovo War. After the signing of the Kumanovo Agreement between Yugoslavia and the Kosovo Force the regiment entered Kosovo as part of the Bersaglieri Brigade \\"Garibaldi\\". The regiment remained in Kosovo until 7 September 1999 and for its conduct there was awarded a Gold Medal of Army Valour, which was affixed to the regiment's war flag and added to the regiment's coat of arms.  Current structure  As of 2019 the Regiment \\"Cavalleggeri Guide\\" (19th) consists of: * 30px Regimental Command, in Salerno ** Command and Logistic Support Squadron ** 1st Reconnaissance Squadrons Group *** 1st Reconnaissance Squadron \\"San Marco\\" *** 2nd Reconnaissance Squadron \\"San Giusto\\" *** 3rd Reconnaissance Squadron \\"San Martino\\" *** Heavy Armor Squadron \\"San Giorgio\\" The Command and Logistic Support Squadron fields the following platoons: C3 Platoon, Transport and Materiel Platoon, Medical Platoon, and Commissariat Platoon. The three reconnaissance squadrons are equipped with VTLM Lince vehicles and Centauro tank destroyers, the latter of which are scheduled to be replaced by Freccia reconnaissance vehicles. The Heavy Armor Squadron is equipped with Centauro tank destroyers, which are being replaced by Centauro II tank destroyers. With the introduction of the Freccia reconnaissance vehicles the reconnaissance squadrons will be reduced from three to two.

It was for children from remote areas of Central Australia who were attending school in Alice Springs.  Background  Griffiths House was originally designed to be a hostel for young single people who had moved to Alice Springs for work, but by the time it was opened on 5 July 1941, plans had already changed, it was immediately converted in to a social club for soldiers stationed in Alice Springs. This club, which also housed the wives of servicemen permanently stationed in the town, was known as \\"The Inter-Church Services Club and Hostel\\". Following the end of World War II, in 1945, the hostel was turned into Griffiths House with the new purpose of housing children from more remote areas who were attending school in Alice Springs. The Hostel was named Griffiths House after the Reverend Harry Griffiths, and his wife Dorothy, who worked for the Methodist Inland Mission, and were instrumental in both originally building and the re-purposing of the site. In 1945 a flood of applications were received from families around the region and the first children to move in were Earl Reidy from Henbury Station, Janice Coulson from Aileron Station and two members of the Coulthard family from Kulgera. By 1946 there were 42 children living there from as far away as Wyndham and Darwin and Griffiths House struggled to meet demand. The children living at the hostel attended Hartley Street School or the Our Lady of the Sacred Heart Convent School. In 1958 a new accommodation block, for senior boys, was built on the site alongside a new kitchen\\\\laundry. This meant that, in 1959, Griffiths House could host 55 children. From 1961 - 1964 demand for accommodation decreased, partially due to severe drought and, by 1964, numbers were down to 33 (21 boys and 12 girls; 7 of whom were Aboriginal) and this led to its closure in 1965. Over 700 children passed through Griffiths House during its 20 years as a children's home. From 1965, following the opening of St Philip's College on 4 April, Griffiths House was re-dedicated as a Youth and Fellowship Centre and it was also used as a Sunday School, meeting venue and accommodation for St Philips College staff. From the 1970, with further expansions, it became low cost rental accommodation and crisis accommodation and a 'bush' family could stay at the hostel for $30 a week rather than pay $20 a night for a hotel. It is estimated that, between 1968 - 1969, 6,000 people used the accommodation. There were often conflicts between residents and the police had to be called on a regular basis and because of these challenges and with the additional stresses of the constant challenge of maintenance, rising building costs and other accommodation becoming available the decision was made to sell and demolish the complex in 1982. The site was then developed by the Aboriginal Development Corporation and would become a part of the site for the Yeperenye Shopping Centre.

Four people were killed and six were injured. It was the third mass shooting in California in less than a week, the others being the Saugus High School shooting that killed three and injured another three in Santa Clarita, and a family murder–suicide in San Diego that killed five and injured one.Teen gunman who killed two in shooting rampage at California high school dies in hospital The Cincinnati Enquirer, November 15, 2019San Diego Shooting: Man Kills Estranged Wife and 3 Sons, Officials Say The New York Times, November 16, 2019  Incident  The shooting happened in a backyard of a home when a group of friends and families were holding a football watch party, to watch the game between the Los Angeles Rams and the Chicago Bears. The party was composed of about 35 to 40 friends and family members of the home owner in attendance. At some point during the party the women and children attending the party had moved inside to watch TV, while 16 men stayed outside to continue watching the football game. At least two suspects snuck through an unlocked gate of the home around 6:00 pm PST and opened fire indiscriminately before they fled on foot. Victims The deceased victims were all men between the ages of 23 and 40 years old. Three men were pronounced dead at the scene while another was transported to Community Regional Medical Center where he died of his injuries. Two of the deceased were well-known Southeast Asian singers. Five others were treated with non-life threatening wounds at the same hospital while another was treated at a different hospital. The surviving victims are men between the ages of 28 and 36. All of the victims are members of the Hmong community in Fresno. Investigation The Fresno Police Department is investigating the incident, with assistance from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and Clovis Police Department. Fresno Police Deputy Chief Michael Reed said the victims were \\"likely targeted\\". The department mobilized an \\"Asian Gang Task Force\\" to look into concerns about the attack being connected to a recent spike in violent crime by Asian gangs.Fresno Shooting: 4 Dead, 6 Injured In Mass Shooting During Fresno Backyard Gathering KPIX, November 18, 2019 On December 31, six suspects were arrested in connection with the shooting, all of whom are believed to members of the Mongolian Boys Society gang. One of the victims was a former member of rival gang the Asian Crips. The shooting was allegedly retaliation for the murder of a Mongolian Boys Society member by a member of the Asian Crips. The suspects are currently detained at the Fresno County Jail and will each face four counts of homicide, 12 counts of attempted homicide, and conspiracy to commit murder with gang and firearms enhancements. In February, a seventh suspect was arrested and charged with the same offenses.  Response  The Fresno area is home to the largest Hmong population in California and the second-largest in the United States. Their community expressed sadness and bewilderment.

Summary  Portrait of Francesco Sforza (c. 1460) by Bonifacio Bembo. Many pretenders claimed to be the rightful successor to Filippo Maria Visconti, who died without a male heir. These included the capable condottiero Francesco Sforza (husband of Visconti's illegitimate daughter), King Alfonso V of Aragon and Naples (to whom Visconti had bequeathed the Duchy in his will) supported by the influential Bracceschi family, Duke Charles of Orléans (son of Visconti's half-sister), Duke Louis of Savoy (brother of Visconti's widow), archdukes Albert IV and Sigismund of Austria (great-grandchildren of Bernabò Visconti), and Emperor Frederick III (who declared the Duchy should revert to the Holy Roman Empire on the extinction of its male line of succession). However, the citizens of Milan and several Lombard towns loyal to Milan proclaimed the Golden Ambrosian Republic (1447–1450) on 14 August 1447, which rejected any hereditary succession. With Sforza as its military leader, the Republic managed to seize and control most of the Duchy of Milan's territory by mid-1448 in battles against rebelling cities such as Pavia, Lodi, and Piacenza, and the invading Republic of Venice (which had already been at war with Milan before Visconti's death). The initial phase of the war may thus be characterised more as a struggle between republics rather than between rival claimants to a throne. Nevertheless, in October 1448 Sforza defected to Venice in exchange for Venetian support for his claim as duke of Milan. Sforza quickly became a successful conquering warlord, whom the Venetians started to fear. Seeking to claim Milan for himself, the Duke of Savoy interfered in support of the Ambrosian Republic in 1449, but they were defeated by the Sforzan–Venetian forces under Bartolomeo Colleoni at the Battle of Borgomanero (22 April 1449). To prevent Sforza from becoming too powerful, the Venetians abandoned Sforza and allied themselves with the Ambrosians in subsequent battles. But it was too late: Sforza conquered the city of Milan after a siege in early 1450, ended the Ambrosian Republic, and was recognised as duke by the senate with support of the population. Then Venice instead allied itself with Naples (an Aragonese possession), which also claimed Milan. Sforza rallied Cosimo de' Medici of Florence and Charles VII of France to his side. The latter sent René of Anjou (claimant to the Neapolitan throne, which he lost in 1442) with an expeditionary force to Italy around 1452 on the condition that Sforza would later aid him to regain Naples. The Milanese War of Succession ended with the Treaty of Lodi (9 April 1454), which recognised Sforza as the new duke of Milan (and established a balance of power in Italy, especially through the Italic League formed in August 1454). The Holy Roman Emperor would not do so until 1494, when Emperor Maximilian I formally invested Francesco's son, Ludovico Sforza, as duke of Milan.

After 18 years as a professor of Engineering and Physics at Brown University, Lawandy founded Spectra Systems Corporation. He is currently the President, and Chief Executive Officer of Spectra Systems Corporation, a London Stock Exchange-listed company and is currently a Professor of Research at Brown University in the School of Engineering.Technology invented by Lawandy is used by many of the world's central banks to protect against counterfeiting of banknotes.  Early life  Lawandy was born in Cairo, Egypt to Mishreky Aziz Lawandy and Anastasia Sakelaridis. At the age of eight, the Lawandy family immigrated to Canada and then to the United States, where they became naturalized citizens. Lawandy grew up in northern Virginia and enrolled at the Johns Hopkins University where he graduated with Honors in 1977 and proceeded to complete his Master's from the same university in 1979. The very next year, he completed his Ph.D. in chemical physics at the age of 23.  Career  Work at NASA Working at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Lawandy was part of a team that developed optically pumped far-infrared molecular lasers for use as local oscillators in astronomical heterodyne detection systems. The lasers developed were used to map the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) in the Orion Nebula using the Keck telescopes at Mauna Kea. While still at NASA, Lawandy was one of the first to observe self-pulsing instabilities and deterministic chaos related to the Lorenz instability and dynamic Stark effects in optically pumped molecular lasers. Work at Brown University After joining the faculty at Brown University in 1981, Lawandy's work throughout his academic career was a combination of experiment and theory. His early work focused on instabilities and chaos in single and multimode lasers with particular emphasis in coherently driven instabilities associated with three-level systems. Lawandy's group was the first to observe optically encoded second-harmonic generation in bulk glasses and predicted the delocalization of carriers in disordered materials in strong light fields. In addition, Lawandy's research group developed novel laser fabrication methods for micro-optics in glasses, announced the first observations of the inhibition of spontaneous emission in a 3D photonic lattice of self-organized colloidal crystals and random media, Casimir forces in ordered dielectric media, laser action in a 3D FCC structure, and Random Laser action in scattering media with optically pumped dyes providing amplification of light. The work on random lasers [“laser Action in Strongly Scattering Media.” Nature 368, 436 (1994)] has resulted in a large body of work by many groups around the world and has been cited over 1400 times. Lawandy has also contributed to the field of plasmonics and predicted the oscillation of localized surface plasmon modes in systems with amplification. Lawandy has served as a thesis advisor to 19 Ph.D. students during his tenure as a Professor at Brown University and delivered over forty invited lectures on various research topics. His research has resulted in over 180 papers in refereed journals and 119 conference presentations and has been cited over 3200 times. Lawandy's career has been covered in many scientific journals and magazines as well as television segments, including The Economist, Scientific American, Science News, Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times, Boston Globe, Fox News, and BBC.  Patents and Awards  Lawandy holds over 100 published US and international patents in a number of applications spanning optical materials, processes, and devices and authentication technology. He is an Alfred P. Sloan Fellow, a recipient of a Cottrell Award, the Presidential Young Investigator Award, a 1995 Photonics Circle of Excellence Award, the Slater Foundation Innovation Award, and the Rolex Prize for his work on using Random Lasers for Photo-medicine. He has served as an editor for Optics Communications and Current Topics in Optics as well as on the scientific advisory boards of Orchid BioComputer and Finesse Solutions.

History of the creation George Gordon Byron was impressed by Lines on the Entry of the Austrians into Naples, which was written by Thomas Moore in 1821. Therefore, he conceived the Irish Avatar as a work in the same vein, attacking the servile Irish as Moore had attacked the capitulating Italians. Thomas Moore had liked the Irish Avatar, and had written in his journal, \\"Received Lord Byron's tremendous verses against the King & the Irish for their late exhibition in Dublin – richly deserved by my servile & hollow-hearted countrymen\\".Moore, Journals, ed. Dowden, II 501, quoted Historical background At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the so-called \\"Irish Question\\" was exacerbated in the socio-political life of England, a process of centuries-old discrimination against the Irish in both religious and socio-economic terms. One of the catalysts was the American Revolutionary War as well as the French Revolution. Against the backdrop of these events, backed by his own desire to break free, a national liberation movement erupted in Ireland, which broke out in the Irish Rebellion of 1798, which was suppressed with extreme cruelty. Under persistent opposition pressure, the British government was forced to repeal part of the punitive laws. The autonomy of the Irish Parliament was briefly established. But as of January 1, 1801, under the so-called Acts of Union, the parliamentary autonomy of Ireland was abolished: the Irish Parliament was abolished, and Irish representatives received some seats in the British Parliament. Byron and Ireland From Byron's letters, we know that the Irish question troubled him back in the years when he was a student at Cambridge University. In his second speech to the House of Lords, which he delivered on 21 April 1812, he spoke in defense of the civil rights of Irish Catholics. The formal reason for the speech was the proposal to set up a committee to investigate the complaints of Irish Catholics. However, from the outset, Byron made it clear that it was not the small details of the situation that arose, and that one should not liken the Lilliputians to their dispute from which end to break an egg. Knowing well the history of Ireland and the events of its modern life, Byron proves that it is precisely through the enmity of Catholics and Protestants in Ireland that an explosive situation is formed that has long been supported by the Government of England. If the government does not provide any subsidies to Catholics, then the Protestants have allocated a considerable amount to schools where children were raised in hatred of Catholics. Particularly strong is the part of the speech in which Byron sharply criticizes English politicians who artificially seek to focus the public's attention on the religious aspect of the problem, thus explaining the specifics of England's domestic policy.The Life., с. 682. Content of pamphlet Irish Avatar was written by Byron in connection with the trip of the King of the United Kingdom George IV to Ireland. Byron's official interpretation of this fact is contrasted with the indignation of British tyranny imbued with angry copyright. Byron's satire is directed against both despotism and lackey. In his satire, the poet is indignant at the anguish of those who crawled before George, as before the new \\"god\\". The author reminds the Irish that in the person of George IV they should see the British government, which took away all their freedoms. The lyrical hero calls on the Irish to fight against British tyranny and speaks of their love for those Irish who are fighting for the freedom of their country.

It took place on February 2, 2019 at the 2300 Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The event aired live as a two-hour television special episode of Fusion on beIN Sports. Fourteen matches were contested at the event, with nine matches being taped for future episodes of Fusion while three matches were broadcast live on SuperFight. The live broadcast notably featured two title changes as Tom Lawlor cashed in his Battle Riot opportunity to defeat Low Ki to win the World Heavyweight Championship and The Hart Foundation (Davey Boy Smith Jr. and Teddy Hart) defeated The Lucha Brothers (Pentagon Jr. and Rey Fenix) to win the World Tag Team Championship. Production =Background= In July 2017, Major League Wrestling resumed promoting events for the first time since the promotion's original closure in 2004. The success of these events lead MLW to secure a television deal with beIN Sports for a new program, MLW Fusion, which debuted on April 20, 2018. On October 8, MLW announced that it would be holding an event titled SuperFight on February 2. On November 9, MLW announced that the event would be held at the famous. 2300 Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. =Storylines= Low Ki was the defending World Heavyweight Champion heading into SuperFight. The card consisted of matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches, with results predetermined by MLW's writers. Storylines were played out on MLW's television program Fusion. Tom Lawlor won the first-ever Battle Riot match at the namesake event on July 19, 2018, thus earning the right to challenge for the MLW World Heavyweight Championship at any place and any time of his choosing within six months. On the October 19 episode of Fusion, Lawlor defeated former champion Shane Strickland to cement his status as MLW's franchise player and then announced that he would challenge Low Ki for the title at SuperFight. This led to the beginning of a feud between Lawlor and Ki's group Promociones Dorado as Lawlor would be attacked by Sami Callihan on the October 26 episode of Fusion, whom Lawlor defeated in a Street Fight on the November 16 episode of Fusion and then Lawlor's teammate Simon Gotch turned on him by setting him up to get attacked by Promociones Dorado. On the December 28 episode of Fusion, Low Ki defended the title against Konnan in a no disqualification match which ended in a no contest after Promociones Dorado members attacked Konnan until Lawlor made the save. On the January 11, 2019 episode of Fusion, Low Ki defeated Lawlor's Team Filthy member Fred Yehi while Salina de la Renta tried to set up Lawlor for an attack by Sami Callihan but Lawlor foiled the plan and attacked Callihan with the hammer. This set up Ki and Lawlor's title match for SuperFight. On November 20, MLW announced that The Lucha Brothers (Pentagon Jr. and Rey Fenix) would defend the World Tag Team Championship against The Hart Foundation (Teddy Hart and Davey Boy Smith Jr.) at Never Say Never on the basis of Hart Foundation's dominant streak in the tag team division. However, Fenix suffered a groin injury and the title match was postponed for a later date. On December 27, MLW announced that Lucha Brothers would be competing at SuperFight. On January 3, it was announced that the originally scheduled World Tag Team Championship match between Lucha Brothers and Hart Foundation would be taking place at SuperFight. On December 21, it was reported by MLW that Kotto Brazil had been attacked by an unknown assailant at a nightclub in Miami and was consequently hospitalized. Promociones Dorado member Ricky Martinez was later revealed to be the assailant and the MLW management suspended him on the December 28 episode of Fusion. Shortly after Brazil recovered from his injury, a match was made between Brazil and Martinez at SuperFight. Event =Preliminary matches= Tom Lawlor defeated Low Ki in the main event of the SuperFight to win the MLW World Heavyweight Championship. The first match that opened the live broadcast featured The Lucha Brothers (Pentagon Jr. and Rey Fenix) defending the World Tag Team Championship against The Hart Foundation (Davey Boy Smith Jr. and Teddy Hart). Smith ripped off Pentagon's mask, allowing Smith and Hart to nail a Canadian Destroyer to Fenix to win the titles. Next, Kotto Brazil made his return to MLW against Ricky Martinez. Brazil had applied a submission hold on Martinez making him tap out but Martinez' valet Salina de la Renta distracted the referee, which led to Brazil grabbing her and Salina sprayed Brazil's eye with a Pepper Spray, allowing Martinez to roll him up for the win. =Main event match= In the main event, Low Ki defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Tom Lawlor. Ki nailed a Warrior's Way on Lawlor but got a near-fall. Ki tried to apply a Dragon Clutch on Lawlor but Lawlor countered it into a rear naked choke to make Ki pass out and win the title. Reception SuperFight received mixed reviews from critics. Jordon Lawrenz of PW Ponderings rated the event 4 out of 10, appreciating the World Tag Team Championship match considering it to be \\"pretty good, but even that could’ve been better, and was easily the best thing on the show.\\" He panned the singles match between Ricky Martinez and Kotto Brazil as well as the quick ending to the World Heavyweight Championship match, citing that the match was \\"SEVEN MONTHS in the making and all they get is basically a seven-minute squash match\\". Arnold Furious of WrestleTalk considered it to be a \\"Very, very disappointing show\\". Cageside Seats staff appreciated the show, considering it to be \\"dynamite\\". According to the staff, \\"All three matches lived up to their marquee billing\\" and \\"Both title matches had a big fight feel.\\" They considered the World Tag Team Championship match to be \\"mighty fine in terms of excitement\\" and \\"The finish was curious from a booking and rumor perspective.\\" According to them, the World Heavyweight Championship match was \\"thrilling\\" and \\"complimented the story that had been told to that point\\" but \\"the finish was abrupt.\\" Aftermath Tom Lawlor and Low Ki continued their rivalry after SuperFight as Lawlor would defend the World Heavyweight Championship against Low Ki in a steel cage rematch at Intimidation Games. On the February 16 episode of Fusion, Teddy Hart defended the World Middleweight Championship against Maxwell Jacob Friedman, who had been stripped off the title in 2018 due to an injury. Hart retained the title but MJF and Richard Holliday assaulted Hart in the backstage area during a post-match interview. MJF and Holliday formed an alliance called The Dynasty and began feuding with the Hart Foundation, which led to a match between the two teams for the World Tag Team Championship at Intimidation Games.

When her parents discovered the relationship, they banned him. Afterwards, she probably lived in Leipzig, temporarily also in Vienna. She met Burgmüller again on 25 August 1804 in Regensburg. On 13 May 1805, they were married, and in 1807 the couple moved to Düsseldorf. She was a sought-after piano teacher for pupils from \\"the first families of the city\\", according to Wolfgang Müller von Königswinter. From 1838 she advocated the publication of compositions left by her son Norbert and sold some to Friedrich Hofmeister Musikverlag in Leipzig.

She possibly travelled to Vienna in the autumn of 1803 and may have recommended to Beethoven the Fidelio-story, which Rochlitz had translated from French, for an opera. She was then possibly Beethoven's lover for even months - from 5 December 1803 to 5 July 1804. Ferdinand Ries, Beethoven's pupil from 1803 to 1805, mentions in his memoirs of Beethoven: Beethoven could have meant Zandt, who according to Kopitz also wrote the address on the letter that Beethoven sent to Friedrich Rochlitz on 4 January 1804. In it, he informed him that he did not want to set a libretto sent by Rochlitz, but had just begun to set the Fidelio libretto to music.Vgl. Ludwig van Beethoven, Briefwechsel.

For example, The Penguin has been voiced by Paul Williams and David Ogden Stiers in the DC animated universe, Tom Kenny in The Batman, and Nolan North in the Batman: Arkham video game series. His live- action portrayals include Burgess Meredith in the 1960s Batman television series and its spinoff film, Danny DeVito in Batman Returns, and Robin Lord Taylor in the television series Gotham. Television =Live-action= Batman (1966–1968 TV series) Burgess Meredith as The Penguin in Batman. The Penguin is in the 1960s Batman television series, in which he was portrayed by Burgess Meredith. Spencer Tracy was offered the role but he said he would only accept the role if he was allowed to kill Batman. Meredith's performance is perhaps best remembered for his signature laugh, meant to mimic the squawk of a penguin. (One cause of the laugh was the cigarettes the character always smoked, which irritated Meredith's throat as he was an ex- smoker.) His thugs wear black bowler hats and dark clothing adorned with names of various animals of prey, such as birds (\\"Hawk\\") or fish (\\"Shark\\"), or sometimes simply \\"Henchman\\". His prison cell is in the \\"Supervillains\\" section next to that of Joker, Riddler, Catwoman, Egghead, King Tut, and adjoining the cell of forger Ballpoint Baxter.\\"The Penguin's Nest\\"/\\"The Bird's Last Jest\\" In one episode, he claims to have been an actor. In the theatrical film spin-off, he commands a submarine painted to resemble a penguin. His given name, Oswald Cobblepot, was never used in this series or the film; by Joker's subordinates, and even in criminal court, he is identified instead as \\"Mr. Penguin\\".\\"The Penguin's Nest\\"/\\"The Bird 's Last Jest\\". He occasionally uses \\"Mr. P. N. Guinn\\" as an alias.\\"The Penguin's Nest\\"/\\"The Bird's Last Jest\\", the film Burgess Meredith also made a brief cameo appearance as the Penguin in the 1968 episode of The Monkees titled \\"Monkees Blow Their Minds\\". Gotham upright Robin Lord Taylor plays a young Oswald Cobblepot in the TV series Gotham, as one of the major characters in the show, and he also has been called the show's breakout character. This version of the character is a ruthless small-time criminal who, at the beginning of the series, works for mobster Fish Mooney (Jada Pinkett Smith). The series traces his rise to power and his journey towards becoming the Penguin. This version of the character has a complicated, love-hate relationship with fellow criminal Edward Nygma (Cory Michael Smith). The two teamed up but also attempted to kill one another throughout the series. In the final episode, set ten years in the future, Penguin has his usual girth while wearing his typical outfit of tuxedo, top hat and monocle while teaming with the Riddler. The pair are actually captured by Batman and hung up together on a light pole. =Animation= * The Penguin is a major character in Filmation's The Adventures of Batman, in which the character's voice was provided by Ted Knight. * Along with the Joker, the Penguin was one of the villains appearing in episodes of The New Scooby-Doo Movies – \\"The Dynamic Scooby-Doo Affair\\" and \\"The Caped Crusader Caper\\" – that were later combined on the DVD Scooby-Doo Meets Batman. He was once again voiced by Ted Knight. * The Penguin was originally supposed to appear in the Challenge of the Super Friends season of Super Friends as a member of the Legion of Doom. However, due to Filmation's The New Adventures of Batman development, the Penguin was restricted to appear in the show. * In Filmation's series The New Adventures of Batman, Penguin is voiced by Lennie Weinrib. He frequently rolls his 'r's and laughs in a manner similar to Burgess Meredith's portrayal, although he has a high-pitched posh accent. He appears in \\"Reading, Writing and Wronging\\", \\"Birds of a Feather Fool Around Together\\", and \\"Have an Evil Day, Parts 1 and 2\\". * When the Penguin appeared in The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians episode \\"The Case of the Stolen Powers\\", he was voiced by Robert Morse. He is shown in prison as a cellmate of Felix Faust. He gains Superman's superpowers by accident when Felix Faust tries to get them for himself. Batman is not featured in the episode. Using Superman's powers, he commits a crime wave where he manages to defeat Hawkman, Samurai, and Aquaman. Using a jet pack and a laser that emits energy of the Red Sun, Superman joins Wonder Woman and Firestorm into fighting the Penguin until Felix Faust's demons capture him. After Firestorm and Wonder Woman do a Kryptonite trick to get Felix Faust to return Superman's powers, the Penguin and Felix Faust are returned to prison—where they are cellmates again, much to the dismay of both villains.Penguin, as he appears in Batman: The Animated Series (left) and The New Batman Adventures (right). * The Penguin is featured in the DC Animated Universe, voiced by Academy Award-winner Paul Williams in all his appearances, except in Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman, where he is voiced by David Ogden Stiers. ** Penguin appears in Batman: The Animated Series. This version of the character featured the Batman Returns version's physical deformities, such as flippers, a beak-like nose and an obvious hunch, but he retained the traditional refined mannerisms and personality of his comics counterpart, although he still refers to himself as a \\"bird\\". He even has the Rubber Duck as seen in the episode \\"The Mechanic\\". His most prominent appearances include the episodes \\"20 - I've Got Batman in My Basement\\", \\"29 - The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne\\", \\"35 - Almost Got 'Im\\", \\"48 - The Mechanic\\", \\"52 - Birds of a Feather\\", \\"54 - Blind as a Bat\\", and \\"72 - Second Chance\\". He is the only villain in the series, other than the Joker, not to be given an origin story. ** Penguin returns in the 1997 follow-up to the original animated series, The New Batman Adventures. In this series, the character appeared more like his traditional comic-book portrayal. His role was also similar to that in the comic books: a \\"legitimate\\" businessman and mob boss who runs a night club called \\"The Iceberg Lounge\\". In \\"Joker's Millions\\" Penguin throws a newly wealthy Joker (who had inherited a fortune from a rival mobster) a party at the Iceberg Lounge. However, the mobster's right-hand man attacked the party, enraged that Joker inherited the money instead of him. Penguin, Joker, and the other guests are rescued by Nightwing and Batgirl. Later, Penguin attempts to stop Batman from interrogating one of the Joker's henchmen at the Iceberg Lounge, but considers it and decides against it. In \\"The Ultimate Thrill\\" Penguin hires Roxy Rocket to steal valuables for him. When Roxy's heists begin to threaten to expose Penguin, he attempts to kill her. When she escapes, he orders his henchwomen to assassinate her. Batman later arrives at Penguin's apartment and, after a short fight, interrogates him for Roxy's whereabouts. In \\"Girl’s Night Out\\" Penguin tries to make Livewire, Harley Quinn, and Poison Ivy leave the Iceberg Lounge for causing a commotion. In retaliation, Poison Ivy floods the Lounge with vines; Penguin is later seen to have hired arborists to cut them. In \\"Judgement Day\\" Penguin is shown buying stolen jewels from Killer Croc and Two-Face, who he cheats out of their rightful pay. After they leave, Penguin is attacked by a vigilante known as the Judge, who attacks Penguin and crushes him with a large Penguin prop. A news report mentions that Penguin survived, but was left in critical condition. ** The Penguin appears in Superman: The Animated Series, in the episode \\"Knight Time\\", in which Superman (disguised as Batman) and Robin interrogate him in order to find the Mad Hatter. ** Although the Penguin does not appear in Batman Beyond, one of the Penguin's outfits is seen on display in the Batcave in the episode \\"Black Out\\". Also, a stage actor playing him in the musical theatre play The Legend of Batman is seen in the episode \\"Out of the Past\\". When asked about the Penguin's fate, show creator Paul Dini stated that the Penguin ended up retiring from the nightclub industry (presumably closing the Iceberg Lounge) and opening a day care center, where the kids call him 'Uncle Pengy'.ToyFare issue, 1999 ** While the Penguin does not appear in Justice League Unlimited, his club, the Iceberg Lounge, makes a cameo appearance at the beginning of the episode \\"This Little Piggy\\". Batman also refers to an occasion where he had to impersonate a singer Penguin had kidnapped. * The character appeared in The Batman, voiced by Tom Kenny. In this continuity, the Penguin is primarily concerned with re- establishing the Cobblepot family name in society by stealing from the citizens of Gotham to rebuild his wealth. While he shares the comic incarnation's love for birds and aristocratic look, this Penguin retained a deformed appearance more similar to the Batman Returns incarnation, but with orange hair (similar to the crests on a rockhopper penguin) instead of black and balding, and sharp, pointy teeth, and fused fingers. When captured, he is placed in Arkham Asylum, despite the fact Penguin is sane in most other depictions. Additionally rather than being a gentleman as in most incarnations, he is portrayed as being rude, selfish, and arrogant. He is sometimes aided by two henchwomen, a masked pair called the Kabuki Twins, and is often partners with the Joker. In addition, he knows martial arts after training in Asia and is athletic enough to engage in hand-to-hand combat with Batman, dodging and parrying with his various trick umbrellas, even beating up the Joker in the episode \\"The Laughing Bat.\\" He holds a grudge against Alfred Pennyworth because the Pennyworths left the service of the Cobblepots generations before. Unused concept art from the show indicates that a more classic version of Penguin had been considered for the show. * In the animated series Krypto the Superdog, the Penguin's trained birds, the Bad News Birds, are recurring foes of Krypto and Ace the Bat-Hound. The Bad News Birds consist of Artie the Puffin, Griff the Vulture (voiced by Matt Hill), and Waddles the Penguin (voiced by Terry Klassen). Although the Penguin is referenced in this series, he never makes an appearance. * The Penguin is featured in Batman: The Brave and the Bold voiced by Stephen Root. In \\"Legends of the Dark Mite!\\", he appears in Bat-Mite's fantasy. In \\"Aquaman's Outrageous Adventure!\\", Batman ends up dealing with the Penguin's crime spree. When Batman is captured and placed in a deadly drinking bird trap, Aquaman comes to his rescue and gets shocked by the Penguin, who reveals that his umbrella drones will spread a paralytic gas over Gotham City. Aquaman manages to make contact with some crabs to free the family as the Penguin sics his minions on Batman and the Aquaman family. Batman redirects the umbrella drones into the ocean and then pursues the Penguin. Upon catching up to him at his submarine, Batman manages to jam the Penguin's umbrella with his cape and defeat him. He then cameos in \\"Chill of the Night!\\" as one of the villains at a weapons auction held by Joe Chill. The Penguin has a quick cameo in the teaser for \\"The Last Patrol!\\" and also appears in \\"Night of the Batmen!\\" fighting Aquaman in a Batman costume, only to be defeated later on. * The Penguin is referred to multiple times in Beware the Batman. In \\"Animal\\", Harvey Dent and his Special Crime Unit are looking at a sketch of the Penguin, with Dent wondering if he just looks like a penguin or actually is one. In \\"Epitaph\\", a newspaper read by a cop has a headline about \\"Penguin Man\\" sightings. In the same episode, a news report ticker displays the headline \\"Oswald Cobblepot identified as the 'Penguin Man'\\". * The Penguin appears in the Justice League Action episode \\"Double Cross,\\" voiced by Dana Snyder. He is the one who hires Deadshot to take out Two-Face. * The Penguin appears in Harley Quinn, voiced by Wayne Knight. In \\"A High Bar\\", he throws a lavish Bar Mitzvah for his nephew Joshua (voiced by Sean Giambrone) and invites several supervillains to attend. Penguin mentions that he first decided to become a criminal during his own Bar Mitzvah and would be honored if Joshua would join him; arranging for a fake bank heist for him to practice on. When Harley Quinn mistakes the fake bank for a real one and attacks the actors Penguin hired to play the guards, Penguin has her captured and attempts to have Joshua execute her. Harley taunts Joshua until he chickens out and decide not to become a criminal. Penguin tries to kill Harley himself, but she manages to escape with the help of Poison Ivy. Following this, Penguin makes minor sporadic appearances throughout of the rest of season one, one of which establishes him as a member of the Legion of Doom. In the season two premiere, \\"New Gotham\\", following the Legion and Gotham's destruction, Penguin has formed the Injustice League alongside fellow survivors Bane, Riddler, Two-Face, and Mr. Freeze to take advantage of the chaos and divide what's left of Gotham between them. When Harley interferes with their plans, they attempt to make peace with her, but she refuses. In response, Freeze has her frozen and put on display in the Iceberg Lounge for Penguin. However, she's eventually able to break free and, after ending up alone with Penguin, kills him in retaliation for everything he did to her. * The Penguin appears in the DC Super Hero Girls episode \\"#EmperorPenguin\\", voiced by Alexander Polinsky. This version of the character is a student at Metropolis High School who runs a number of dishonest schemes and blackmails other students into helping with them. Film =Live-action= * Burgess Meredith played the Penguin in the 1966 film Batman alongside several other villains. * In the script written by Tom Mankiewicz for the unmade The Batman film, which was later made as the 1989 film Batman, the Penguin was set to appear as an arms dealer with low body temperature, described as a \\"thin and tall man\\". Peter O'Toole was considered for the role. * In an early draft of Batman 2, which was later made as Batman Returns, the main plotline involved Penguin and Catwoman going after hidden treasure. Danny DeVito as The Penguin in Batman Returns. * Danny DeVito portrayed the Penguin as the main antagonist in Batman Returns. While this Penguin retained many trademarks, such as a variety of trick umbrellas and the use of a monocle, he was given a dramatic visual makeover. Where the comic version varies between a balding head of short cropped hair and varying degrees of thinning, this Penguin is still bald at the top but with his remaining length of hair long and stringy. His hands are flippers with a thumb and index finger, and the remaining three fingers fused together. An unidentified thick, dark green bile-like liquid sometimes trickles from his nose and mouth. Instead of a tuxedo, he wears a more gothic, Victorian-style outfit with a jabot as opposed to a bow tie. In certain scenes, he also wears black boots, a dickey, and a union suit. However, Burton's design maintained the top hat seen in the comics along with a monocle and a cigarette in some scenes. He also has penguin-like appetites, as shown in a scene where he devours a raw fish. Director Tim Burton, inspired by the film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, re-imagined the character not as an eloquent gentleman of crime, but a deformed, psychopathic and infanticidal killer who holds a homicidal grudge against the aristocrats of Gotham City. The film provides him a backstory in which his wealthy parents Tucker and Esther Cobblepot (Paul Reubens and Diane Salinger), threw him into the sewer as a baby after watching him attack their cat and having scared their nurse with his appearance upon his birth. He survived and was raised by penguins who lived in the sewer lines at an abandoned zoo, and traveled in the Red Triangle Circus Gang's freak show as a child. 33 years later, he resurfaces as an adult to run for mayor of Gotham with the help of corrupt businessman Max Shreck (Christopher Walken). Meanwhile, he plans to kill every first-born son of Gotham's elite, and teams up with Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) to frame Batman (Michael Keaton) for murder. Batman foils his scheme and the Penguin dies following a climactic duel with the Dark Knight where he succumbs to the wounds sustained from the fall from his ceiling and from the toxic sewage. His penguin family carries out a makeshift funeral, pushing his body back into the water. * The Penguin is directly referenced in Justice League (2017). In a scene with dialogue between Bruce Wayne/Batman and Alfred Pennyworth, the latter makes a quip about how people used to only have to worry about \\"exploding wind-up penguins\\", a reference to Batman Returns. * Colin Farrell has been cast as The Penguin for Matt Reeves' forthcoming The Batman. The Penguin in The Batman will be depicted as a rising crime lord in Gotham, whom, due to having a penguin-like physical appearance, receives the nickname \\"Penguin,\\" which he dislikes. =Animation= * He appears in Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman, this time voiced by David Ogden Stiers. The plot involves the Penguin, Rupert Thorne and Carlton Duquesne in an illegal arms deal with the President of Kasnia. Of the three Batwomen, the Penguin shares a personal history with Dr. Roxanne Ballantine; he framed her fiancé Kevin years before, which led him into prison in order to find evidence that would get his sentence commuted. When Batwoman proves to be more than he expected, the Penguin hires Bane to kill her. In the aftermath, he is arrested with Thorne and Duquesne. * Tom Kenny reprised his role of Penguin in the animated movie The Batman vs. Dracula. In the movie, after escaping from Arkham Asylum, the Penguin, after accidentally nicking his hand on his umbrella knife and bleeding on a corpse, accidentally resurrects Count Dracula in the Gotham cemetery (while in search of buried treasure). Dracula then hypnotizes the Penguin to work for him and the Joker is turned into a vampire by Dracula despite Penguin's warnings. Batman later gives the Joker and the other vampires the antidote after several tests. Penguin is later released from the spell upon Dracula's death but is arrested for attempting to steal the treasure (which belonged to a criminal mob), and for trying to kill Vicki Vale for Dracula, and is thus returned to Arkham Asylum, since the police don't believe his rants about \\"vampires with big honkin' fangs\\". * The Penguin appears in the animated film Lego Batman: The Movie – DC Super Heroes Unite (an adaptation of the video game of the same name), voiced by Steven Blum. * The Penguin's umbrella can be seen in the Batcave in Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox, at the end of the film. * The Penguin appears in Batman: Assault on Arkham, voiced again by Nolan North. He is hired by Amanda Waller to give the Suicide Squad arms, equipment, and shelter in his Iceberg Lounge for the night prior to their mission to infiltrate Arkham Asylum and take out the Riddler. He appears to have worked with Deadshot before and respects him as the city's best assassin, as he chooses to only work with the best, and he holds a grudge against the Joker and Harley Quinn for their having sunk a truck of his cigarettes \\"just for a laugh\\". * The Penguin appears in Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League vs. Bizarro League, where he is voiced by Tom Kenny. Gorilla Grodd brainwashes him, Captain Cold, Deathstroke, and Giganta into stealing crates of bananas for him. When the mind-control's broken he takes off on his duck vehicle, but Green Arrow fires a net arrow at him and he is captured. * The Penguin appears in Batman Unlimited: Animal Instincts, voiced by Dana Snyder. This version is more muscular and somewhat unevenly-shaped as his legs are smaller than the top half of his body. He appeared to have aged a bit due to his wrinkles and graying hair, although he is still very strong. His monocle is robotic, allowing him to secretly analyze his surroundings and listen in on conversations. Tired of the scorn he receives for his looks, he decides to destroy Gotham with meteorites. To this end, he forms his Animalitia, consisting of Cheetah, Killer Croc, Silverback, and Man-Bat. He cures Man-Bat of his affliction occasionally for the genius of Kirk Langstorm, who builds animal robots to serve as the Animalitia's army. His plan ends up foiled and he escapes into a pod, which unfortunately lands in Antartica. Snyder reprises his role as Penguin in the sequel Batman Unlimited: Mechs vs. Mutants. * The Penguin appears in the direct-to-video animated film Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League: Attack of the Legion of Doom, voiced again by Tom Kenny. He is among the villains that audition for a spot in the Legion of Doom. Penguin alongside Joker and Man-Bat are rejected because the Legion of Doom doesn't have enough parking spaces at their headquarters. * The Penguin makes a cameo appearance at the end of Batman: Bad Blood, where he is seen in the middle of a car chase with the police and the Bat-Family members goes to stop him. * The Penguin appears in Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League: Gotham City Breakout with Tom Kenny reprising his role. He is among the villains unintentionally freed from Arkham by Superman. Near the end of the movie, he is defeated by Cyborg and sent back to Arkham. * The Penguin appears in Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders and its sequel Batman vs. Two-Face, voiced by William Salyers. * The Penguin appears in The Lego Batman Movie, voiced by John Venzon who was uncredited for the role. He appears as one of the numerous villains trying to destroy Gotham City. Unlike most of his performances in film, Penguin appears as a minor character and has only a couple of lines. His sickly appearance, outfit (mainly the spotted tie and fluffy coat) and pointed teeth are based on Danny DeVito's portrayal in Batman Returns. His clothes have been designed to look stretched over his stomach with the buttons about to pop, mimicking his obesity. He also has a small indent in his upper lip, showing where his pointed nose would be (most LEGO characters don't have noses). * The Penguin appears in DC Super Heroes vs. Eagle Talon, voiced by Mitsuo Iwata. * A Feudal Japan version of Penguin appears in the anime film Batman Ninja, voiced by Chō and Tom Kenny in Japanese and English respectively. * The Brave and the Bold version of the Penguin appears in Scooby-Doo! & Batman: The Brave and the Bold, voiced by Tom Kenny. * The Penguin appears in the film Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: The Flash with Tom Kenny reprising his role. He prepares to fire a giant missile when Batman comes to stop him, but Batman accidentally fires his missile. Reverse-Flash comes to stop it by taking it apart and building a playground out its parts and those of his car. He becomes the fourth of the many villains Reverse-Flash captures to win the hearts of the citizens. * The Penguin appears in the crossover film Batman vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, voiced again by Tom Kenny. Scheming to steal valuable technology from Wayne Enterprises, the Penguin ended up fighting the Turtles, who defeated him despite his weaponized umbrella. Penguin managed to get away. He was later hired by Ra's al Ghul to steal the same technology from a Wayne Enterprises ship, but Shredder betrayed him by killing his men and refusing to pay him. Having no choice, the Penguin left without payment. Video games =Lego Batman= * The Penguin appears in Lego Batman: The Videogame,Game Informer features a two-page gallery of the many heroes and villains who appear in the game with a picture for each character and a descriptive paragraph. See \\"LEGO Batman: Character Gallery\\", Game Informer 186 (October 2008): 93. with his vocal effects provided by Tom Kenny. He is one of the leaders of the Arkham breakout. His plan is to use mind-controlled penguins to wreak havoc in Gotham. To this end, he employs the Catwoman, Bane, Killer Croc, and the Man- Bat. He has the ability to call out robotic penguins from under his top hat. He can use his umbrella both as a gliding apparatus and a rifle. His submarine serves as the second boss of Chapter 2 \\"Power-Crazed Penguin.\\". He calls it with a remote control to attack Batman & Robin, but they defeat it by towing mines into the cross-haired areas and then firing torpedoes at it. He then sets off with Killer Croc to rescue Catwoman. When he starts up his machine, the penguins run amok, but Batman & Robin show up, and he fights alongside Catwoman to stop them. The player needs to throw a Batarang or Robin's staff at the rotating motors to damage him. If they're not running, the player needs to reflect his penguins at the purple structures while fending off Catwoman to make him start the machine up again. When all the purple structures are destroyed, he'll glide around the arena, and the player needs to throw a Batarang at him to make him fall to the ground, and the player can damage him. Despite his comic book appearance, he has some ideas and characteristics of Danny DeVito's Penguin (e.g. taking over Gotham with a penguin army, having a liking for raw fish, and working with Catwoman). Being a Lego character, he cannot be portrayed as fat (although his clothes have been designed to look stretched with the buttons about to pop in some versions), nor does he have his signature pointed nose. * The Penguin appears in Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes, voiced by Steve Blum. In the level \\"Arkham Asylum Antics,\\" he rides with Bane on his mole machine along with Poison Ivy. He also appears at Gotham Zoo as an optional boss. His only dialogue (aside from one line in the intro) is squawking. * The Penguin appears as a playable character in Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham, voiced by JB Blanc. His appearance is based on the Batman: Arkham version. Penguin has his own side-quest where the player has to destroy his penguins after they go out of control. He has another side-quest where the player has to dress like a penguin in order to listen to how he was bullied during his childhood. * The Penguin appears in Lego DC Super-Villains, with JB Blanc reprising his role from the last game. =Batman: Arkham= * In all of his appearances in the Batman: Arkham series, The Penguin is voiced by Nolan North in the main series and Ian Redford in Batman: Arkham VR. He has been redesigned without penguin-like mannerisms such as the waddle or the squawk- laugh, but retains his beaked nose and monocle, here depicted as the bottom of a glass liquor bottle, said to have been shoved into his face by the friend of a young man that Penguin was torturing after cheating at cards. Penguin says that the bottle is lodged too far into his brain and the surgery to have the bottle removed would kill him. He is also still obese, sickly, a heavy smoker, and bald. ** While the Penguin is not featured as an actual character in Batman: Arkham Asylum, as a key character in Batman's universe he is repeatedly referenced. An asylum security guard notes that he had witnessed the attempted smuggling of sharpened umbrellas into Arkham on at least one occasion before, a reference to the character. Additionally, an Iceberg Lounge advertisement can be seen in the Intensive Treatment wards, while a collection of trick umbrellas and top hats (apparently confiscated from Penguin upon his admittance to the facility) may be observed on display in the old Arkham Mansion. He is also one of the villains whose name is listed on the party list. ** The character later physically appears in Batman: Arkham City, In this game, like in the comics, Penguin is indirectly responsible for Victor Zsasz's descent into villainy, having cheated a young Zsasz out of his inheritance at a game of poker. He also wears what appears to be an electrolarynx strapped to or implanted in his neck. According to the Arkham City Stories included in the game, Cobblepot became trapped in the open-air prison perimeter of Arkham City after refusing to vacate his residence at the Iceberg Lounge (which was condemned as part of the new project). Cobblepot went on to establish himself as a kingpin in the new criminal underworld, using the nearby museum to enshrine defeated enemies, vying with the Joker and Two-Face for control of Arkham City. At the start of the game, he and his minions attack the just-incarcerated Bruce Wayne, only to have his hand broken by Wayne (which results in its being bandaged in such a fashion that it resembles one of Penguin's flipper-hands from Batman Returns). Later in the game, Batman tracks him down in order to retrieve Mr. Freeze, who Penguin is holding captive, as Freeze is the only one who knows how to cure Joker, Batman, and half of Gotham of the TITAN poison. Making matters worse is the fact that Penguin is holding several undercover cops captive. Despite his use of Mr. Freeze's freeze gun, the captive Solomon Grundy, and a rocket launcher, Penguin is ultimately defeated by Batman. Mr. Freeze adds insult to injury by locking Cobblepot in the exhibit planned for Bruce Wayne, where he remains for the rest of the game. ** In Batman: Arkham Origins, a younger version of the Penguin is credited as Gotham's number one weapons dealer, using a legal loophole by staying aboard his refitted cruise liner, The Final Offer, to evade the law, while his goons make deals with the other gangs in Gotham. He is first mentioned after Batman scans a smashed recon drone found during the Blackgate riot, revealing that Penguin had been using it to spy on who he thought was Black Mask, but was really a disguised Joker. After interrogating one of his dealers, Batman makes his way to Penguin's ship. After fighting his way through Penguin's thugs, his assistant Tracey, and Electrocutioner, Batman finds and interrogates Penguin for information about Black Mask. Penguin mentions a murder in Lacey Towers but is unable to reveal more before Batman is attacked by Deathstroke. In the game, Penguin does not yet have the bottle in his eye from Arkham City meaning the accident will happen after Origins. In the DLC \\"Cold, Cold Heart\\", the Penguin's thugs are working with Mr. Freeze in his revenge mission against GothCorp CEO Ferris Boyle. Mr. Freeze had offered the Penguin weapons in exchange for his aid breaking into GothCorp, only for Penguin to betray Freeze and try to force him to give them superior weapons, culminating in Freeze trapping Penguin in a vast block of ice while Batman leaves Penguin to shiver until the police arrive. During the credits of the \\"Cold, Cold Heart\\" DLC, it was mentioned in a news voiceover that Penguin, Mr. Freeze, and Ferris Boyle have been arrested by the police. ** The younger Penguin later returns in the spin-off game Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate as one of the criminals released in the Breakout, having been imprisoned after the events of Cold, Cold Heart. Along with the Joker and Black Mask, Penguin takes control of one of three buildings at Blackgate; Penguin takes control of the Cell Blocks, being able to control movement around the island. He recruits any inmates not loyal to the clown or Sionis; when Bronze Tiger saves a guard from being hanged by his men, Penguin forces him to fight guards to the death in his makeshift arena in the Exercise Yard. Batman later arrives and defeats Bronze Tiger, who injures Penguin with a gun. Followed all the way to the entrance to the Arkham Wing, Penguin is soundly defeated by Batman. Penguin later escapes thanks to a guard he bribed and kills said guard to keep him quiet. ** The Penguin appears in Batman: Arkham Knight. He is portrayed as \\"grungier\\" and more like a mob boss, now with a shaved head and a gold chain. Due to the warmer weather, the Penguin is seen without his long coat. He has allied himself with Two-Face while in preparation for Scarecrow's united assault on Batman and his allies. During the game, Batman receives information that Penguin knows the location of Barbara Gordon, who was kidnapped earlier by the Arkham Knight. With the help of Nightwing, he infiltrates Penguin's hideout and learns of Simon Stagg's involvement in her capture. Later, Batman and Nightwing team up to take down all of Penguin's weapon caches. He also appears as a hallucination during Joker's takeover of Batman's mind, and is gunned down alongside Two-Face, Killer Croc and the Riddler. Finally, a radio report of a museum dedicated to the Penguin as \\"Batman's archenemy\\" is heard during the Joker's nightmare about being forgotten. After all of his weapons caches are destroyed, Penguin is captured and taken to the GCPD by Batman. If he is taken down after Scarecrow is defeated, he ends up mocking Batman because his identity as Bruce Wayne has been revealed and especially because of how much trouble the Dark Knight is about to face now that everyone in Gotham knows who he is. If it was before Scarecrow's defeat, he will rub in how he nearly killed Nightwing during the last weapons cache's destruction, only to be vaguely threatened to be killed by the Dark Knight in response. Although Penguin initially tries to call his bluff, he ultimately ended up intimidated when he learned that Batman hadn't been himself that night. In the \\"Harley Quinn Story Pack\\" DLC, set before the events of the main game, Penguin communicates with Quinn over the radio guiding her through the Blüdhaven Police Department as she sets to break Poison Ivy out. In the Arkham Episode \\"GCPD Lockdown\\" taking place some time after the main game, Penguin attempts to escape imprisonment from the GCPD, but is stopped by Nightwing. =Batman: The Telltale Series= Penguin appears in Telltale Games' Batman series, voiced by Jason Spisak. This iteration of the character was the childhood friend of Bruce Wayne, is far more physically fit and less deformed than most versions of the character (the normal, obese character design is reserved for his father). Additionally, the Cobblepot family was not involved in crime or corrupt, but lost power due to the influence of Thomas Wayne and his allies. Unlike most versions of the character, Penguin gets his name from a beak- shaped gasmask he wears during his crimes, and uses gadgets and technology as opposed to birds and trick umbrellas. * In the first season, Batman: The Telltale Series, Penguin is a member of the Children of Arkham, helping the group get revenge on the Wayne family. Though he initially warns Bruce about their revolution, he leads the group in various attacks and helps take control of Wayne Enterprises as its CEO, using his position to help fund the group and monitor Gotham. Penguin can also be partially responsible for Harvey Dent's fall from grace by disfiguring him during an attack on a mayoral debate by the Children of Arkham, should the player choose to rescue Catwoman. In the fourth episode, Penguin is able to hack into the Batcomputer, forcing the vigilante to either stop him in order protect his tech and gadgets and leave his home vulnerable to Dent and his enforcers or abandon his tech and gadgets to protect his mansion. If Oswald is defeated by Batman at Wayne Enterprises, Bruce will receive the brand new Batsuit Mark 2 to combat Lady Arkham. If Bruce confronts Oswald at Cobblepot Park (should the player give up Batman's tech to stop Dent), he can distract him to allow Lt. Gordon to destroy the box controlling Oswald's drones, allowing him to be captured. * In the second season titled Batman: The Enemy Within, Penguin's mask and one of his devices (either his \\"monocle\\" or boxing gloves) are kept in a display in the Batcave. Also, the news reveals that Oswald pleaded guilty in court and was sentenced to forty years at Blackgate Penitentiary where he is considered by the guards as a \\"Model Prisoner\\" for his charming and smart attitude. After completing the game and returning to the Batcave, it is revealed that Penguin applied for parole only to be rejected. =Other games= * The Penguin has appeared as a boss in several Batman video games, including Batman: The Caped Crusader, the various video game adaptations of the movie Batman Returns, Batman: The Animated Series and Adventures of Batman & Robin for the Super NES. * At one point he was planned to appear as a boss in The Adventures of Batman & Robin for the Sega CD, in which he would try to kidnap Summer Gleeson. The Penguin was cut from the game because it was tight on villains, but the storyboards for his animated cut-scene are displayed in Paul Dini's book, Batman Animated. * The Penguin is the chief villain of an online flash game, Batman: The Cobblebot Caper, which is modeled after The Batman animated series. His ultimate plan is to construct a giant mechanical phoenix which he intends to use as a war machine against Gotham City. * The Penguin appears in DC Universe Online, voiced by David Jennison. Following Bane's defeat, a cut-scene features the Penguin stating his anger at the competition from the Falcone Crime Family, Bane, Two-Face, the Mad Hatter, Hush, Killer Croc, the Catwoman and the Joker due to all the chaos, but being a cunning crook, he plans on tricking them into wiping each other out and taking Gotham for himself. The players discover that a hacked kiosk contained a message from Two-Face describing the Penguin's smuggling operation in Gotham's old subway tunnels. The Penguin is served by Cryo Pengbots, Louie Sluggers, Machine Gun Tommies, Nickie Blades, Pengbots, Pyro Pengbots, Tammy Two Guns and a Pengbot Maximus. * The Penguin is among many other DC characters included in Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure. * The Penguin makes a cameo appearance in Injustice: Gods Among Us sporting his Arkham City look. In the Arkham Asylum level, if one of the characters is thrown through the cell door on the right side of the second tier, they will be attacked by Two-Face, Killer Croc, Riddler, and Penguin before being punched by Croc into the next tier of the Arkham arena. * The Penguin was originally set to appear as a playable character in Injustice 2, but was cut from the game for unknown reasons. Toys * An 8″ version of the Penguin was created by the Mego Corporation as part of their \\"World's Greatest Super-Heroes\\" line in 1974. Mego also released a ″ Penguin as a part of their Comic Action Heroes line in 1976. * The Lego Batman line includes one particular set, The Batcave: The Penguin and Mr. Freeze's Invasion, which features Penguin. He appears as a minifigure in the set, with short, unbending legs, the classic top hat and monocle and a purple pin-stripe suit, but lacks the familiar pointy nose. Penguin rides in a submarine reminiscent of the one in the 1960s TV series and is assisted by miniature penguin robots. The set also includes a depiction of the Batcave. * He also appears in the Lego Batman promotional video. He is the final villain to be caught (after Two-Face, Mr. Freeze and Joker). * The Penguin was featured in the 1980s Super Powers Collection toy-line, featuring various DC Comics villains and heroes. The Penguin's appearance was much like that of the time, with a blue coat and top-hat. Penguin had \\"umbrella action\\" where his legs could be squeezed together, triggering his arm (holding an umbrella) to move up and down; this figure sculpt was later used for the Batman Returns figure line, with a new black paint application. * There have been various toys of the Penguin for cartoon series, from the sophisticated aristocrat to the deformed outcast styles. For example, a limited edition \\"The Batman\\" Penguin action figure was made with a red coat, which he wore in one episode. An action figure based on his \\"Batman: The Animated Series\\" counterpart came with several accessories, including a teacup and two umbrellas. * Recently the Penguin was made into a toy by Funko who made small ″ figures with large heads and also soft toy version of the Penguin. The Penguin figure looked much like he had in Burgess Meredith's style from the 1960s, along with the comic book look. The figure featured an umbrella accessory, but the plush did not. The Robin Lord Taylor figures were available with and without sunglasses. * Madame Alexander has made female dolls based on the Penguin, the Joker, and Harley Quinn (who is surprisingly not male) as part of its DC Fashion Squad line. While the Penguin doll resembles Danny DeVito's portrayal, the logo on the box looks more like the Burgess Meredith version. The Joker doll resembles a cross between Mark Hamill and Heath Ledger's portrayals, whereas the Harley Quinn doll has curly red and black pigtails, as well as a vintage-style dress. Parodies * Nicholas Joseph Strauss-Matathia portrays the Penguin in a musical production entitled Holy Musical B@man! by StarKid Productions. * The Penguin is portrayed by Patton Oswalt in an episode of the CollegeHumor skits, \\"Badman\\", slightly redesigned to look more in line with the Nolan Batman films. In the short, he and Commissioner Gordon try to explain the concept of death to an oblivious Batman, who thinks that the henchman felled by the edged weapons merely go to \\"sleep\\".Bricken, Rob (April 15, 2013). \\"Patton Oswalt is a perfect Penguin in the newest Badman installment\\". io9. * In the Season 7 episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, \\"Frank Reynolds' Little Beauties\\", Frank Reynolds -- played by Danny DeVito -- while hosting a children's beauty pageant, gets grotesque makeup applied to cover up a broken nose, and wears an ill-fitting tuxedo, making him resemble very much The Penguin from Batman Returns. Later, he unwittingly says some very embarrassing things into a hot mike, causing the pageant to descend into chaos, echoing a similar plotline in the film.

She became so effective at expanding the library's reference works that she was allowed to devote some of her time to the Danish branch of Amnesty International (AI) over a number of years. After working as a campaign coordinator for the organization, in 1983 she was appointed a member of the Danish board. From 1986, she served as chair of the Danish branch before becoming a member of AI's most important decision-making authority, the International Executive Committee (IEC), in 1989. Two years later, with her appointment as head of the board, she became the first woman and the first Dane to head Amnesty International. While working for AI in Denmark, she fought for the release of prisoners of conscience and against human rights abuses in Chile, South Africa and the Soviet Union. She also set up a Danish group to campaign against torture and the death penalty and to prevent disappearances in Argentina. After becoming chair of the Danish branch, she ran campaigns against mass executions in Iran and abuses in Israeli-occupied territories. Chosen to coordinate AI's work in the European Community, she campaigned against member states' restrictive asylum developments for those seeking to escape torture, imprisonment or death. In 1989, as a member of AI's IEC, she was involved in responding to the suppression of democracy in China and in coordinating work on human-rights education, in particular with a view to preventing torture and the death penalty in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Fischer travelled throughout the Middle East and North Africa, extending AI membership and spreading its views. In 1990, she represented AI at the Second International Human Rights Conference in Vilnius and Leningrad. After being appointed head of the IEC, demands on her time for voluntary work increased, forcing her to cut her paid library work to half time. Her husband helped her along and took her on holidays to reduce the stress. It was when they were returning from a holiday in Italy that they both died in a head-on collision in torrential rain in Florence on 11 July 1992.

Launched in 1905, she was the first of six similar vessels built for the company–the Binngarra class—the success of which saw three of her sister vessels serving through to the 1970s and 1980s. Built by Mort's Dock and Engineering Co Ltd, in Woolwich, she was a double-ended screw steamer with steel hull and timber superstructure. She was decommissioned from ferry service in 1930. \\"Binngarra\\" is thought to be an Australia Aboriginal word for \\"spring\\" or \\"returning\\". It is sometimes misspelled as \\"Bingarra\\". Background Kuring-gai (1901) was the forerunner to the \\"Bingarra-type\\" vessels including Barrenjoey. Note the wheel houses located midships compared to Barrenjoeys at the ends of the sun deck. The Port Jackson & Manly Steamship Company's fleet transitioned comparatively late to screw propelled vessels and the fleet comprised mostly paddle steamers until the early years of the twentieth century. The difficulty of turning in the narrow bays of Sydney Harbour - particularly in the busy Circular Quay terminus in Sydney Cove - required the use of double-ended vessels. However, a double-ended screw configuration was particularly difficult for the fine bows that Manly ferries required for both speed and heavy seas. Further, a propeller at the leading forward end of a vessel reduced speed considerably. In the prosperous early twentieth century, this speed drawback was overcome by increasing engine size and power. The first screw ferries on the Manly run were two innovative Walter Reeks–designed vessels; the SS Manly (1896), and SS Kuring-gai (1901), which were to become the fore-runners of the \\"Binngarra-class\\" ferries. They both had high forecastles at either to help her run through the deep-sea conditions across the Sydney Heads. The steel-hulled Kuring-gai was larger and she further refined the basic design that would be the basis of the subsequent and larger \\"Binngarra-class\\" vessels. Design and construction Bingarra crossing the Sydney Heads on her way from Manly to Circular Quay While Manly and Kuring-gai followed paddle steamer design with their bridges around the midships funnels, the \\"Binngarra-class\\" vessels would have their wheelhouses at either end of their sun decks. This design, of which Binngarra was the first, would be the basic form of the Manly ferries that served for most of the 20th century up to and including the in the early 1980s. Subsequent to Binngarra, five similar refinements of the design were built - Burra-Bra (1908), Bellubera (1910), Balgowlah (1912), Barrenjoey (1913), and Baragoola (1922). The class were designed by Mort's Dock and Engineering, initially under the guidance of former chief draughtsman Andrew Christie. Bingarra and the next four were built at Mort's Woolwich yard while Baragoola was built at the Balmain yard. They were among the largest ships built in Australian yards at the time and, on the admission of Mort's executives, were built by the dock more for prestige than profit. Build costs were higher in Australia than in the United Kingdom, but this was offset by the cost of sailing them out to Australia. Binngarra's triple expansion steam engines were built by Mort's Dock and Engineering, and had cylinders , , and respectively in diameter, with a stroke of , and steam reversing gear. Steam was generated by two Navy type boilers each in diameter and long, with corrugated furnaces of in diameter, which were tested for a working pressure of . A donkey boiler also fitted. Service history Binngarra crosses the Sydney Heads in a heavy swell Binngarra had her official trials on 26 October 1905 where she reached and she entered service three days later on the 3 pm run from Circular Quay to Manly. Two days after she collided with the sea wall at the Quay. In 1926, she collided with the wooden K-class ferry, Kanimbla. Damage to the larger steel Binngarra was minimal, however, Kanimbla was severely damaged and according to some reports, was lucky not to sink. It is estimated that over her 24 years of ferry service, Binngarra completed close to 100,000 round trips to Manly and carried 30 million passengers. She and Kuring-gai were removed from service in 1930 and 1928 respectively, following the 1928 introduction of the larger and faster Dee Why and Curl Curl.Manly Ferries Balgowlah, Barrenjoey & Baragoola History Works December 2007 Binngarra was sold and hulked in 1933 and used in Port Stephens. Following her use in New Guinea as a cargo hulk for United States Navy during World War II, she was scuttled off Sydney in 1946.

It is close to the Lascaux rock art caves and is situated in the region which forms the Unesco World Heritage site Prehistoric Sites and Decorated Caves of the Vézère Valley, but is not officially a part of it. The finds in the shelters date to the Mousterian and Magdalenian periods, or between 160,000 and 12,000 years ago. The most important of the 10 shelters is the Reverdit rockshelter. Importance Reconstruction of a necklace found at Castel Merle, in the Blanchard shelter Castel Merle was one of the most densely populated Paleolithic areas found so far, populated first by the Neanderthalers and then by direct ancestors of modern man. Many of the shelters contained decorated rocks (paintings and engravings. Castel Merle was one of the first sites where sieving of the excavations was done, resulting in the findings of many very small objects. Different shelters here revealed thousands of beads, pearls intended for necklaces or clothing. These were made from various materials, including soapstone, bone, shells, mammoth ivory and teeth (animal and human). Many of these materials were imported over long distances, at least 100 km for the shells, and perhaps even from current-day Germany for the ivory. No burials were found here. Location Between Lascaux and Les Eyzies, in the heartland of the prehistoric rock caves and shelters of the Vézère valley, lies a small tributary valley, the Vallon des Roches. The small river runs for some between two rock faces, and on each side 6 rock shelters have been found and prehistoric remains unearthed during excavations. The shelters on the left side of the river are open to the public, and the plain in between the rocks houses a small museum. In the museum are kept, apart from many prehistoric tools, also some remains of necklaces with pearls made from mammoth ivory, and a few engraved rocks. Main shelters =Reverdit= The Reverdit rockshelter, which has a small source and was later used as a shepherd's hut, was first excavated in 1875 by Alain Reverdit. A more scientific excavation was done between 1911 and 1914 by F. Delage, finding two layers dating to the Magdalenian. In 1923 Castanet found damaged sculpted friezes on the ceiling, displaying a horse and some bisons. =Roc de l'acier= In this shelter, artifacts have been found from the Périgordian period (35,000 to 20,000 years ago), and earlier occupation from the Aurignacian seems likely here as well. =Labattut= This shelter was excavated in 1912 and 1913 by Castanet. Most remains are from the Périgordian and the more recent Solutrean times. Rocks which were originally part of the back wall of the shelter, but which afterwards have fallen down, showed paintings of a hand and of three animals; a mammoth and a deer painted in black, and a bison in black against a red background. These rocks are now in the National Prehistoric Museum in Les Eyzies. Another rock showed a large engraving of a horse, and is now kept in the American Museum of Natural History. =La Souquette= La Souquette shelter This shelter is wide and deep. It has been used in the Middle Ages as a shelter as well, and shows remains of the habitation at that time. The prehistoric finds were excavated first in the early 20th century by abbe Landesque, and date to the Aurignacian and the Magdalenian. Here were found different necklaces, consisting of pearls in ivory, bone, and teeth. Another find was a rock with an engraved bison. =Blanchard= Perforated shells found in the Blanchard shelter In this rock shelter were found about 20 engraved and probably painted rocks, mainly with vulva motives. Here as well beads were found, some made from shells which came from the Mediterranean area, over away. =Castanet= Castanet shelter This rock shelter, like the Blanchard shelter, had some rocks with engraved vulvas and phalli. In the rock, both at ground level and in the ceiling, small rings have been made which may have been used to fasten a screen of animal skins at the front of the shelter. This shelter was further excavated in 2012 by White, unearthing more than 150,000 (often very small) artifacts.

The series, created by Richard and Esther Shapiro and produced by Aaron Spelling, revolves around the Carringtons, a wealthy family residing in Denver, Colorado. Season five stars John Forsythe as millionaire oil magnate Blake Carrington; Linda Evans as his wife Krystle; Jack Coleman as Blake and Alexis's earnest son Steven; Gordon Thomson as Blake and Alexis's eldest son Adam; John James as Blake's former son-in-law Jeff Colby; Pamela Bellwood as Steven's wife, Claudia; Heather Locklear as Krystle's niece and Steven's ex-wife Sammy Jo; Michael Nader as Alexis's husband Dex Dexter; Catherine Oxenberg as Blake and Alexis's youngest daughter, Amanda; Michael Praed as Amanda's fiancé Prince Michael of Moldavia; Diahann Carroll as Blake's half-sister Dominique Deveraux; Billy Dee Williams as Dominique's husband, Brady Lloyd; Rock Hudson as Sammy Jo's biological father, Daniel Reece; Ali MacGraw as photographer Lady Ashley Mitchell; and Joan Collins as Alexis Colby, Blake's ex-wife and the mother of Adam, Fallon, Steven, and Amanda. The season also introduced recast Emma Samms as Blake and Alexis's daughter Fallon. Development Driven by the new head writer and producer Camille Marchetta, who had devised the wildly successful \\"Who Shot J.R.?\\" scenario on Dallas five years earlier, Dynasty hit #1 in the fifth season. During the season, Dynasty attracted controversy when Rock Hudson's real-life HIV-positive status was revealed after a romantic storyline between his character Daniel Reece and Evans's Krystle. Hudson's scenes required him to kiss Evans and, as news that he had contracted AIDS broke, there was speculation Evans would be at risk. The event led to a Screen Actors Guild rule requiring the notification of performers in advance of any scenes that require open-mouth kissing. Undoubtedly the most famous Dynasty cliffhanger is the so-called \\"Moldavian Massacre\\" which occurs in the May 15, 1985 fifth- season finale. Amanda and Prince Michael's royal wedding is interrupted by terrorists during a military coup in Moldavia, riddling the chapel with bullets and leaving all of the major characters lying seemingly lifeless. Esther Shapiro later said, \\"It was a fairy-tale terrorist attack. It was beautifully shot, like a Goya painting.\\" It became the most talked-about episode of any TV series during the calendar year of 1985, with a viewership of 25.9 million.E! True Hollywood Story: Dynasty (2001) In 2011, Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly named it one of the seven \\"Unforgettable Cliff-Hangers\\" of prime time dramatic television. Plot In the story, Alexis is exonerated for Mark's murder and her secret daughter Amanda comes to Denver and discovers that Blake is her father. Steven has married Claudia but leaves her for another man, and Claudia starts an affair with Adam. The marriage of Blake and Krystle is in crisis after the birth of their daughter Krystina; Dominique struggles to be accepted as a Carrington, and loses her husband Brady Lloyd in the process; and Sammy Jo discovers she is the heiress to a huge fortune. At the end of the season, an amnesiac Fallon reappears while the rest of the family go to Europe for the wedding of Amanda and Prince Michael of Moldavia.

Retrieved November 8, 2019. Early life and career Behnke was born in Hartford, Connecticut in 1946. She initially studied interior design at the Pratt Institute (BFA, 1969), developing an interest in architecture, but switched to art, producing abstract sculpture that reflected the dominant influence of Minimalism and Constructivism.Marberger, A. Aladar. \\"New Faces/New Images,\\" Ocular Magazine, Winter 1980.Gokduman, Safak Günes. \\"Light, Time, and Space,\\" RHT Art Magazine, March, 2012, p. 54–61. During her graduate studies at New York University (MFA, 1976), she explored geometric sculpture and painting that was influenced by Hans Hofmann; a back injury prompted her permanent shift to painting. Like many Photorealist artists (e.g., Chuck Close, Ralph Goings), Behnke turned from abstraction to representation, seeking a greater connection to experience and a more accessible style; nonetheless, she retained Abstract Expressionism's formal emphasis and concern for the artwork as physical object.Arthur, John. American Realism: The Precise Image, Tokyo: Asahi Shimbun and The Brain Trust, 1985. In 1976, she began producing multi- panel paintings investigating sequentiality, perception and temporality, which bore the influence of Monet's color and light studies and of conceptual photographers, such as Hilla Becher, Hanne Darboven and Jan Dibbets.Hise, Jeri. \\"Interview with Leigh Behnke,\\" Leigh Behnke Real Spaces, Imagined Lives, Padova, Italy: Coop.

Art historian Virginia Anne Bonito wrote that in this work Behnke sought to create representational versions of Josef Albers's abstract, chromatic investigations (the \\"Square\\" paintings), colorist analogues to Muybridge's stop-action photography, and deconstructions of Cubism. Behnke rented her first New York studio in 1972, sharing a Christopher Street space with painters John Wesley and Robert Birmelin; soon after, she met future husband, Don Eddy. After completing graduate studies, she exhibited actively, in group shows at the Phoenix Art Museum, Barbara Gladstone Gallery, Institute for Contemporary Art, Richmond, and Whitney Museum, among others,Price, Hardy. \\"New York Art Scene at Museum,\\" The Arizona, April 25, 1979.Ames, Barbara and Julia Boyd.

Leigh Behnke, Light Study with Venetian Blinds, oil on wood panel, 15\\" x 82\\", 1981. Collection of Brown and Wood. Destroyed September 11, 2001 in World in Trade Center. Work and reception Behnke emerged in the late-1970s amid resurgent interest in Contemporary Realism and changing norms regarding the relationships between representation and abstraction, referentiality and content.LeClair, Charles. The Art of the Watercolor, Spectrum Books, Prentice Hall, 1985. Art historians note that despite changing subject matter, the basic premises of her art have remained remarkably consistent: unpopulated, realist, multi-panel works that explore formal and conceptual issues involving perception, experience, the articulation of space, and the underlying mechanisms of the world. John Arthur compared her associative strategy to montage in film editing, which juxtaposes scenes to create new, unique meanings; curator Christopher Young correlates her method to Ferdinand Saussure's semiotic theories of language and signs. Leda Cempellin relates Behnke's approach to Renaissance narrative devices, the Cubist investigation of reality through fragmentation, and scientific method, which approaches phenomena from multiple perspectives. She and others suggest this approach creates several dichotomies in the work: representational realism and formalist abstraction, order and chaos, classical illusionism and postmodern fragmentation, city and nature, interior and exterior, celestial and terrestrial. =Early work: 1976–1980= Behnke's early paintings were formally focused and consisted of multi-paneled, meticulously rendered conceptual watercolors based on her photographs of interiors, still lifes, cityscapes or architecture.Merrit, John. \\"On Paper,\\" Richmond Times-Dispatch, September 9, 1980.Finch, Christopher. Twentieth Century Watercolors, New York: Abbeville Press, 1988. Retrieved November 8, 2019. This work examined the effects of carefully manipulated variations in light, perspective and arrangement on color, form, and composition, while also pushing value ranges and color intensity to rare extremes (for watercolor) through dozens of glaze layers, often requiring a month's time in total.Mitchell, Mark. \\"Aiming for Masterpieces,\\" American Watercolor, Spring 1992, p. 90–1. Despite its realism, her investigations of color theory and \\"shadow dramas\\" of changing light (e.g., the \\"Time Sequence\\" and \\"Light and Intensity Variation\\" series) often drew comparisons, in formal terms, to the subtle value shifts and grids of Minimalist art.DePietro, Anne Cohen. A Feast for the Eyes, Huntington, NY: Heckscher Museum, 1981. Conceptually, Behnke's work of this time confronted the incompatibility between the sculpturally solid and dynamic natures of reality, reconciling change and stability, as well as art historical strategies for capturing experience (Renaissance, cubist and futurist). For example, the triptych Time Sequences/Value Changes (1979) investigates compositional and color effects as light and shadow exchange roles in a windowed interior; other works enact a similar strategies with exteriors, or still lifes (Three Spectral Pairs, 1978).

Collection of Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc. =Interiors and cityscapes: 1980–1999= By 1980, Behnke's work had evolved in three ways: she added oil paint to her repertoire, increasingly turned to New York City as a subject, and introduced a greater sense of temporality and unfolding, layered meaning through her use of the predella, a horizontal, multi-frame pictorial device of subsidiary, adjoined images often used on early-Renaissance religious altarpieces.Chwast, Seymour and Steven Heller. The Art of New York'', New York: Harry N. Abrams, 1983. Retrieved November 8, 2019. Her oil paintings successfully adapted watercolor techniques—friskets and layered transparent glazes—that reviewers suggested endow the surfaces with a smooth, \\"mirror-like believability.\\" In the four-sequence oil work Light Study with Venetian Blinds (1981), she examined shifting conditions of light, color, and view (as the blinds close); the interiors Geometric Configurations: Variations on A Square (1982) and East Hampton Staircase With Landscape (1986) explored compositional and formal possibilities in predella and triptych formats. Behnke's cityscapes used these formats in a similar manner, bringing disparate viewpoints (bird's-eye, low-angle), dramatic changes in scale, and tightly cropped fragments into dialogue with one another; critics Grace Glueck and Gerrit Henry wrote that the composite works expressed \\"the dynamics of New York City life\\"Glueck, Grace.

Leigh Behnke, New York: Fischbach Gallery, 1991. Works such as Brooklyn Bridge Compositional Study (2nd Version) (1983), Bridge Promenade (1991), Wallace's Heresy and Broken Symmetry (both 1990), often reduced buildings to geometric forms and colliding rhythms, generating visual tension through compressed, activated space.Whitney Museum of Modern Art. \\"Lower Manhattan From Street to Sky,\\" 1982. In her presentation of multiple perspectives, Behnke portrayed urban experience as visually complex—continuous, fragmented, dislocated, monumental and transient—and ambiguous in its effects: awe, pleasure, progress, disorientation, claustrophobia.Gallati, Barbara Dayer. American Art Today: Night Paintings, Miami, FL: Frost Art Museum, 1995. Retrieved November 8, 2019. Leigh Behnke, Annie's View, oil on wood panel, 36\\" x 36\\", 2000. Collection of Sidley Austin Brown & Wood. From the 1990s onward, iconography and narrative play an increasing role in Behnke's work, triggering senses of collective history, the past, and time in the dialogue between imagery; she has expanded its scope to include cosmological and natural phenomena, universal forms, and scientific theory.New York Magazine. \\"Exhibitions: Leigh Behnke,\\" New York Magazine, April 4, 1994. The images of her stacked, three-panel works, Sidereus Nuncius (1990), Interregnum (1995) and Blind Sight (1996), navigate and contrast varying rhythms, elements (land, water, air, light) and perspectives, progressing bottom to top from microcosm (fish, flowers, grass) to the human environment to macrocosm (the stars); such work often invokes scientific investigation and exploration: Sidereus Nuncius (\\"Starry Messenger\\") was an early astronomical book by Galileo Galilei, Wallace's Heresy references natural selection theorist Russel Wallace), and \\"blind sight\\" refers to pre- modern navigation methods. In the architectural triptychs, Archimedes's Dream (1998) and The Paradox of Infinite Regression (1999, above), Behnke explored complex, patterned spatial and geometric relationships and the mathematical form of the spiral or nautilus; critic Hilton Kramer called the latter work \\"a virtuosic pastiche of Futurism, Cubism and Realism executed with consummate skill.\\" Leigh Behnke, Aristotle's Fifth, oil on wood panel, 36\\" x 24\\", 2016. = Later work: 1999– = In 1999, Behnke received an E.D. Foundation grant to work on paintings based on Victorian homes, and chose to focus on Sagamore, Theodore Roosevelt's summer estate on Long Island. The resulting \\"Sagamore\\" series (1999–2000) used composite imagery, Behnke's own photographs, and information from several sources to project an imagined life onto historical people (domestic staff, the Roosevelts) and the space. Annie's View (2000) envisioned the house as seen and experienced by a servant, Annie, through four images unified visually by careful attention to the interplay of light and shadow and a strong sense of illusionism. Its primary upper panel depicts a corner of the top floor of a large house (where servants traditionally lived) as passers-by would see it; the lower three-scene predella reproduces, successively, the view from Annie's window, her room, and the back staircase, suggesting a fragmented reconstruction of her life there: a view of imagined freedom, the constraint of indoor employment, up-and-down labor. Other paintings in the series, such as Entrance for Edith and Alice and Sagamore: Downstairs, depict the home as seen from the Roosevelts' point of view. In recent years, Behnke's imagery has become more varied, incorporating a wider range of elements (carousels, ornamental metalwork and statuary), locations and formats (single-image works) alongside her characteristic studies of architectural spaces and exteriors.Behnke, Leigh. Through the Looking Glass: Leigh Behnke, New York: Fischbach Gallery, 2009. Behnke, Leigh. Leigh Behnke: Memory and Myth, New York: Fischbach Gallery, 2013. Her 2009 exhibition, \\"Through the Looking Glass,\\" focused on portals—passages, doors, arches, windows, stairwells—as vehicles for formal play and the evocation of imaginative and real dimensions and spaces; her work since then has often explored mythological iconography, as in Aristotle's Fifth (2016), which employs her tri-part, microcosm-to-macrocosm progression.

It is believed to have been one of three remote radio sites operated by the Diplomatic Wireless Service and managed from Hanslope Park near Milton Keynes. All three of these sites were located in rural locations in Buckinghamshire, the other two being close to the villages of Gawcott and Poundon respectively. Building and intended purpose The original buildings and aerials were erected in 1944. Little is known about these buildings, but some photographs are available. In these photographs a semi-circular transmission building believed to be of the same design as the one located at Signal Hill in Gawcott (which still exists today) can be clearly seen. The site was completely overhauled and modernised in 1989-90 with many of the post-war buildings, including the main transmission building, being demolished and a new state-of-the-art building replacing them. The main building contains 5000sq/ft of highly secure, purpose built technical space divided into two areas, one denoted the 'Drive and Mux Room' (approx 1000sq/ft) and the other the 'Transmission Hall' (approx 4000sq/ft). Dual- redundant power was designed in to the building from the outset and a dedicated HV connection to the grid supported the historical use of the site. This combined with 2x Rolls Royce Diesel Generators provides excellent power redundancy. In recent years diverse fibre optic communications have been installed meaning the site has an abundance of connectivity. Modern times Documents found at the site suggest that the facility was decommissioned in 1995 and after sitting empty for several years it was sold to the local farmer upon whose land the access route resides. The building is now privately operated as a specialist technical site offering commercial services such as Internet hosting services. In November of 2019, a pair of IBM System 360 Model 20 were moved to Creslow Park for restoration.

The Council sees itself as \\"strictly non-partisan\\" network and as an \\"interface\\" between diverse elements of Syrian society, political actors, and the international community. The name of the Council is derived from a charter called 'Code of Conduct for Syrian Co-Existence' (مدونة سلوك لعيش سوري مشترك), which was signed by its founding members in November 2017. The Arabic word mudawana can stand homonymously for 'charter' or 'code' . The existence of the ‘Code of Conduct’ was revealed to the international media in January 2018. The initiative claims to be the first of its kind as it brought together prominent Syrian societal leaders, across political divides to agree on basic principles for a new social contract in the country. The members of the Council consider themselves influential figures in Syrian society, who are able to facilitate mediation between parties involved in the conflict They comprise representatives of Sunni Arabs, Kurds, Alawites, Druze, Ismailis, Circassians, Yazidis, Turkmens and Christians of various denominations. The tetrapylon displayed on the Council’s crest evokes the structure of the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Palmyra, which was partially destroyed by ISIL militants in 2015. The tetrapylon symbolises the resilience and cultural diversity of the Syrian people, while the crest’s colours and arrangement may allude to the flag of Syria, the first Syrian Republic or those of the 1930s’ independence movement from the French Mandate. History and Positions Among the Council’s founders are members of prominent Syrian families. These include: Mustafa Kayali, a political activist and dentist from Aleppo and the grandson of Abd al-Rahman al-Kayali, who was one of the key figures in the National Bloc of Syria’s independence movement; Sami Khiyami, Syria’s former ambassador to the United Kingdom; Mohammad Habash, a former member of the People's Council of Syria and religious reformist thinker, Ibrahim Ibrahim Basha, sheikh of the Milan Kurdish tribal federation and grandson of tribal leader Ibrahim Pasha Milli, Prince Mulham al-Shibli of the Fawa'ira tribal federation; Sheikh Amir al-Dandal of the Uqaydat tribe of Al-Bukamal (Abu Kamal); Sheikh Oweinan Jarbah of the Shammar, Sheikh Abdelilah al-Melhem of the Annazah tribe; and several other tribal leaders The current spokespeople for the Council are Abdallah Rophael, a Syrian Christian lawyer from Homs; Sheikh Amir al-Dandal and Sheikh Mamduh al- Tahhan. Sima Abd Rabou, a former political activist and digital expert from Damascus, served as a spokesperson until January 2020 with Ibrahim Shaheen, a lawyer from the Alawite community of Homs. According to an interview he granted to the public German TV channel ZDF, the Syrian-born German legal scholar Naseef Naeem from the Christian village of Fairouzeh, chaired the negotiations that led to the signing of the Code of Conduct and the creation of the Council. The Original document of the Code of Conduct for Syrian Coexistence. The eponymous charter, the Code of Conduct for Syrian Coexistence, includes 11 paragraphs on topics such as: the recognition of society’s diversity, the individual (not collective) accountability for crimes and violations during the Syrian Civil War; and the principle of ‘no victor, no vanquished' In irregular intervals and based on the principles of the Code of Conduct for Syrian Coexistence the Council publishes declarations, mostly on social, societal and ethical aspects of the crisis in Syria. In view of the imminent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Syria in April 2020 the Council called on all conflict parties to release detainees \\"in an act of humanity\\" since detention facilities would not be able to deliver sufficient medical support. The Council also called on the international community to cooperate with the conflict parties and to deliver medical supplies to mitigate against the pandemic on Syrian territory. Controversy The revelation of the negotiations surrounding the Code of Conduct for Syrian Coexistence, which were conducted in secret, drew considerable attention from the international and Arabic press. The case was widely discussed among Syrians inside the country and in the diaspora Citing security concerns, several members of the Council has not officially disclosed their names, a fact that several Arabic commentators have criticized. Despite this, various reports have stated that representatives from the Alawite communities in Tartus, Latakia, Damascus and Homs play key roles in the initiative, which is consistent with some of the Council’s statements.

From 1786 to 1788 he was engaged by the society of Gustav Friedrich Wilhelm Großmann and its co-director Christian Wilhelm Klos, which played in Cologne, Düsseldorf, Bonn and Aachen. From there he moved to the Theater Bonn, which opened on 3 January 1789. The young Ludwig van Beethoven played viola in the orchestra of the theater. At the beginning, the ensemble also included Carl Demmer, Joseph Lux and Heinrich Vohs as well as music director Friedrich August Burgmüller. From November 1796 Spitzeder is traceable at the society of Karl Haßloch in Kassel and made his debut on 27 September 1799 in Weimar as Osmin in Mozart's Singspiel Die Entführung aus dem Serail. In 1804 he was briefly active at the Theater an der Wien where he got into great financial trouble and apparently had no opportunity to perform.

It played an important role in the city's history. The head is found in St. Peter's Church in Leuven.  The crooked or brown cross  The statue, which was made around 1200, was originally featured in the Kolvenierskapel in St. Peter's Church. Crooked Christ was the miracle statue of Leuven, which means that it was an image with a special devotion connected to it. Every time a disaster threatened the city, the crucifix was carried around in a procession. This ritual was practiced from the fourteenth century to the eighteenth century. The posture of the statue was striking: it represented a crucified Christ, but unlike more common representations, his right arm hung loose and his entire body was bent forward. Folktales attributed this exceptional attitude to (mythical) achievements. One tale is about how the statue grasped a thief who wanted to steal a golden crown. Historians suspect that the statue originally was part of a group of statues that represented the descent from the cross. Such image groups were common in the 12th and 13th century, especially in Southern Europe.  Church fire  During the First World War in 1914, a fire burned in the church. Multiple pieces were lost in flames, including the Crooked Cross. However, at the time of the fire Christ's head was in the workshop of sculptor Egide Goyes, who was restoring it between 1843 and 1845. Goyes had replaced the original head with a cast. In 1928 the work appeared in an art dealership in Saint-Germain-en- Laye, where it was bought five years later by Abbé H., a Parisian prehistorian.

History  Hungarian bath culture has a long history of hundreds of years, which was founded in the time of the ancient Roman Empire and later developed further under Turkish influence. Due to its historical traditions, Budapest is customarily described as the city of spas, which, besides satisfying domestic needs, makes the Hungarian capital extremely popular among tourists. Sparty built a popular event on these traditions of thermal baths, where the night bathing is complemented with light and laser shows and live music. At the events, organized in the Lukács and Széchenyi Baths in Budapest, guests can enjoy a mix of thermal baths, visual effects and music between the several hundred years old walls.  Popularity  The fame of Sparty is well characterized by the fact that 50,000 visitors attend the events each year.

The district comprises 348 Chicago bungalows built from 1915 to 1931. As homeownership became more affordable in early twentieth century Chicago, the bungalow became popular as an affordable and easily replicable home style, and tens of thousands of the homes were built throughout the city. While more industrial than average, the Belmont Cragin area was otherwise typical of the new bungalow neighborhoods, as it was an underdeveloped area on the outskirts of the city. Laughlin Falconer, for whom the district is named, owned and farmed on the land before dividing it and selling it to developers in 1913. Architects Ernest Braucher and Johan F. Knudson designed most of the bungalows in the district; both architects frequently gave their houses full-length, open-air front porches, and the district has one of the city's most significant collections of open front porch bungalows as a result. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 7, 2007.  History  In the mid-1800s, the Scottish immigrant Laughlin Falconer settled in the land for farming. The area was transformed into a mixture of industrial, commercial, and residential in the early decades of the 20th century. In November 1915, home building initiated in the Falconer District. Edward H. Olsen and Henry Van Vooren started on a series of bungalows on the 4900 block of West Oakdale Avenue. George C. Hield, a former hay dealer from Wisconsin, was the most important player in the growth of the Falconer District. He purchased most of the land subdivided by the Falconer family between 1913 and 1919. According to the Chicago Tribune, Hield had the intention of building thirty houses of various designs, including single dwellings of the ordinary type, bungalows, and two flat buildings. From November 1915 to April 1921, only three of 101 homes built in the district were constructed by builders other than Hield and Olsen and Van Vooren. After 1921, dozens of developers, builders, architects, and potential homeowners filled the remaining lots, building 240 properties between 1921 and 1925.  Working-class neighborhood  Like other bungalows that sprang up between the northwest extensions of Chicago, the Falconer Historic District was not segregated from the industrial and manufacturing districts. The developers of the Falconer District built homes within walking distance of major areas employers. The availability of manufacturing and clerical jobs in the Belmont Cragin community allowed extended family and adult children of a good number of bungalow owners made contributions to the household economy. This was advantageous to the Depression of the early 1930s. One example of these cases was a Norwegian-born piano tuner at musical instrument factory Lyon and Healy on Fullerton Avenue. His oldest son worked as a pattern maker at a clothing factory, while 19-year-old-son worked as a file assistant with an electric parts manufacturer.

Belfer-Cohen excavated and studied many important prehistoric sites in Israel including Hayonim and Kebara Caves and open-air sites such as Nahal Ein Gev I and Nahal Neqarot. She has also worked for many years in the Republic of Georgia, where she made important contributions to the study of the Paleolithic sequence of the Caucasus following her work at the cave sites of Dzoudzuana, Kotias and Satsrublia. She is a specialist in biological Anthropology, prehistoric art, lithic technology, the Upper Paleolithic and modern humans, the Natufian-Neolithic interface and the transition to village life. Belfer-Cohen has published hundreds of papers and co-edited several books. Her work is widely cited in the field of Prehistoric Archaeology and especially the Natufian culture.https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hRLBIJMAAAAJ&hl;=en Belfer- Cohen is married with two children and four grandchildren and currently resides in Jerusalem. Early life and education Anna Belfer-Cohen was born in Rivne, Ukraine in 1949 to Halina (Ala) and Yehuda Belfer. The family immigrated to Israel in 1956. After completing high school in her home town Petah Tikva, she began studying toward her first degree in archaeology at the Institute of Archaeology, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where she also earned her MA (1981) and PhD (1988). Already in her undergraduate studies she participated in many archaeological expeditions in Israel, Cyprus and Sinai.Phillips, J. (2010). Introduction.

She was appointed full professor at the Institute of Archaeology, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, in 2002. From 2005–2009, she served as the head of the university's Institute of Archaeology. From 2014 to 2018 she was the head of the Authority for Research Students (non-experimental Sciences). Scientific contributions Woman's Pelvis Decorated with Fox Teeth, Natufian Culture, Hayonim Cave Early in her career, Belfer-Cohen participated in excavations at the Lower Paleolithic site of ‘Ubeiydia in the Jordan Valley (the oldest site in Israel), at Upper Paleolithic and Epipaleolithic prehistoric sites in the northern Sinai Desert, at the burial sites from the Chalcolithic age and Early Bronze Age in the southern Sinai. During her MA studies, Belfer-Cohen analyzed the lithics and bone tools from the Aurignacian layer at Hayonim cave (dated to 35,000 years ago). In her work she identified the Levantine Aurignacian and its uniqueness in the Upper Paleolithic sequence in the area. Through the years she helped understanding the interactions of this hunter-gatherer culture with its European counterpart.Belfer-Cohen, A., & Bar-Yosef, O. (1981). The Aurignacian at Hayonim Cave. Paléorient, 19-42. In her PhD Belfer-Cohen discussed the technological and spatial aspects of the Natufian material remains from Hayonim Cave in the Galilee, including architecture, burials, lithic assemblages, ground-stone tools and personal ornaments.Belfer-Cohen A. The Natufian settlement at Hayonim Cave: A hunter- gatherer band on the threshold of Agriculture [PhD thesis]. Jerusalem: The Hebrew University; 1988. In this work she provided the basis for the modern study of the Natufian culture and shaped the important research questions, which are still employed by the current research. Belfer-Cohen took part in many archaeological projects, some that lasted several decades, such as Kebara and Hayonim caves, where she was involved in the study and publication of the findings.e.g. Belfer-Cohen, A., & Bar-Yosef, O.

This is a joint Georgian-USA- Israeli project directed by her on behalf of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, in collaboration with Dr. Tengis Meshviliani, Georgia State Museum and Prof. Ofer Bar-Yosef from Harvard University. In this project the team established the chronology of the local Upper Paleolithic, with the arrival of Homo sapiens, and their local adjustment as compared to the Neanderthals of the preceding Middle Paleolithic. The project includes excavations at Dzudzuana cave, 1996-2001; 2006–7. Another central question in the project was aimed at establishing whether the transformation from hunter-gatherers unto agriculturalists wan an endemic innovation, acculturation of ideas from elsewhere, or the result of invasions of foreign groups. This entailed excavations at the Kotias Klde rockshelter in 2002-2005; 2008–2010.

Previously, she was the communication manager for the National Research Foundation and managed her own independent science communication consultancy for a decade. Her consultancy presented the first online course in science communication in Africa. Joubert has been honoured with the NSTF award for \\"Communication for Outreach and Creating Awareness\\" and is an honorary life member of the Public Communication of Science and Technology (PCST) Network (Australia), granted for \\"distinguished contribution to the international science communication community\\". She is an outspoken proponent of science communication and opposes anti-vaccination propaganda, and all quackery and pseudoscience in general.  Education and career  Joubert obtained her BSc Food Science (Cum Laude) at Stellenbosch University in 1984, followed by BSc Honours (Cum Laude) in 1986 and Journalism Honours (Cum Laude) in 1987. She completed her MSc (Cum Laude) at University of Pretoria in 1989 and her PhD at Stellenbosch University in 2018. From 1989 she worked as communication manager for the Foundation for Research Development, followed by the National Research Foundation (NRF) in 1999. In 2001, Joubert became science communication manager for the South African Agency for Science and Technology Advancement (SAASTA) (part of the NRF). In 2005 Joubert established Southern Science, an independent science communication consultancy, that she managed until March 2014. Part of her work during this time was to co-present science communication workshops, aimed at early-career academics, in conjunction with Robert Inglis and the University of Pretoria. The course was the first online course in science communication in Africa and more than 180 African science communicators had completed this course by 2019. In 2014, Joubert joined the University of Pretoria under contract as research communication specialist and part-time lecturer/researcher at Stellenbosch University.

In 2017 she participated in the International summit on quackery and pseudoscience held in Stellenbosch. The summit covered areas such as: the rise and dangers of pseudoscience and science denialism, communicating uncertainty in science, health regulation, science in court, the media and pseudoscience, and exploiting the desperately ill, the vulnerable and the ignorant. Her presentation was on \\"Science-based evidence: Accurate and ethical communication.\\" Joubert was interviewed by Inside Education in 2017 with regards to the journal article In the footsteps of Einstein, Sagan and Barnard: Identifying South Africa’s most visible scientists. In the interview she explained that less than 1% of the scientific workforce appears in public. Therefore these \\"visible scientists are increasingly recognised as the new scientific elite, because their high public profiles allow them to spread their ideas, influence policymakers, defend science and promote a culture of science in society. In our society, they are also the role models that shape the public image of science.” In 2018, Joubert said a collaboration was planned with researchers from the United States, UK and Australia with the \\"study aimed to better understand the messages and claims of anti-vaccination lobby groups and their potential impact on vaccination programmes in South Africa. .... We are hoping to collaborate with a number of countries to see how these groups formulate their arguments, what evidence they use and how they validate their arguments.\\" The study was to run from 2019 to 2021. She has also been interviewed in this regard by CapeTalk radio station.

The Archives of Appalachia is a repository for memories — the written words, images, and sounds that document life in southern Appalachia. the archives steward nearly two miles of rare manuscripts, 250,000 photographs, 90,000 audio and moving image recordings, and 14,000 books. More than 2,000 visitors from ETSU and around the globe utilize the collections each year for scholarly and creative projects. The Reading Room is open to the public Monday through Friday from 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m Archives of Appalachia, 4th floor  Early History  The Archives of Appalachia at East Tennessee State University (ETSU) opened on September 1, 1978 located on the first floor of what is now known as Nicks Hall. Created as part of the Institute of Appalachian Affairs by Dr. Arthur H. DeRosier, Jr., newly appointed President of ETSU, its mission was to coordinate research and public service relating to the sociological, political, economic and cultural aspects of life in southern Appalachia. Dr. Richard M. Kesner served as the first Director from 1978 to 1981. Early collections included the Washington County Court Records 1777-1950, the East Tennessee Education Association Papers, the LeRoy Reeves Papers, and the B. Carroll Reece Papers. Under Kesner's direction, the Archives added other valuable collections, including the Carolina, Clinchfield and Ohio Railway Records, the Magnet Mills Collection, and the Broadside Television Collection. alt= From the Archives' beginning, institutional and public outreach played a vital role in achieving notable goals. Grants in 1979 and 1981 from the Tennessee Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Humanities allowed the Archives to develop the Appalachian Outreach Program, through which it produced nine slide-tape presentations about the region for teachers and community groups. The Archives developed teaching packets to accompany the presentations, which included transcripts, bibliographies, and suggested classroom activities for public school students. After the departure of Dr. Richard Kesner, Dr. Ellen Garrison served as Director from July 1982 to January 1987. In 1982, the Tennessee Committee for the Humanities awarded a grant for the Archives to develop a series of three radio programs titled “Tennessee’s Mountain Heritage.” Based on material from the Archives' collections, the series was broadcast over the WETS radio station in May of 1983. Under Garrison's direction, the Archives implemented a computerized access system in 1986 and hired Norma (Myers) Thomas as Technical Services Archivist. Dr. Garrison resigned as director of the Archives in January 1987.  Center for Excellence in Appalachian Studies and Services  In 1984, as a part of the state’s Better Schools Program passed by the 1984 legislature, ETSU inaugurated the Center of Excellence for Appalachian Studies and Services (CASS). CASS included the Institute for Appalachians Affairs, the B. Carroll Reece Museum and the Archives of Appalachia.The Archives acquired additional space when the medical library moved out of Sherrod Library. The additional space allowed for a conference room, map and over-sized material room, as well as additional storage space. In 1986, in recognition of ETSU’s 75th anniversary, the Archives produced a series of exhibits on ETSU's history and helped prepare a time capsule that was deposited in one of the globe columns at the campus amphitheater. The time capsule was opened during the ETSU’s 100th anniversary in 2011. In 1988, Norma (Myers) Riddle became the Archives’ third director. Under Riddle’s leadership, the Archives continued its robust growth, adding hundreds of new collections on a range of historical and cultural topics related to southern Appalachia. Significant additions included the papers of the long-serving member of the U.S. House of Representatives James H. Quillen; the Coal Employment Project Papers, which document the struggle for workers’ rights for female coal miners; the records of the East Tennessee & Western North Carolina Railroad; and unique recorded sound collections including the Mary Elizabeth Barnicle and Tillman Cadle Collection of field recordings from the 1930s through the 1950s. Archives of Appalachia--Sherrod Library--alt= Increased media collections created unique demands for preservation and access, and during Riddle’s tenure the Archives applied for, and received, at least a dozen grants to preserve rare audio and moving image holdings. A major grant from the NEH in 2003 funded a large preservation project and also served as the basis for the creation of the Archives’ media digitization lab. Over time, the lab has developed the capacity for digitizing over a dozen formats of analog audio and moving image materials. Outreach also remained a focus for the Archives throughout the 1990s and beyond. From 1994-1995, the Archives worked with Panther Press to publish a two-volume series of D.R. Beeson’s hiking diaries. The series, edited by Riddle and Archivist Ned Irwin, was titled In the Spirit of Adventure and featured diary transcripts and photographs of hikes that D.R. Beeson and C. Hodge Mathes made of the Great Smoky Mountains (1914) and Mt. Mitchell (1915). In the 1990s, work promoting digital access to collections continued. In 1996, the Archives entered the digital era with the launching of its first homepage, and in 1997 it was selected to participate in the “Monticello Electronic Library” pilot project, which was an attempt to make available online collection descriptions for 22 repositories in the southeast. In 1997, the administrative responsibility of the Archives, previously shared between the Center for Appalachian Studies and the University Library, was changed to the Center only and the Archives was restructured. Previously known as the Archives and Special Collections with subdivisions of Archives of Appalachia, University Archives, and Special Collections, the name was officially changed to the Archives of Appalachia, consisting of three units – Appalachian Manuscript Collections, University Archives, and Special Collections. In 1999, the Archives of Appalachia received a grant from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences to preserve selected recordings and to develop a radio series drawing on the materials in these collections. The one-hour weekly radio series, titled \\"From the Archives,\\" was broadcast on WETS public radio station and featured performances of a range of traditional music. In 2000, the Archives was awarded a grant by the National Historical Publications and Records Commission to preserve original and rare recordings in the Barnicle-Cadle, Bernard Rousseau, and Broadside Television collections and make them more accessible to researchers. As part of an effort to make its collections more accessible, the Archives posted all of its finding aids available online by 2000.  21st Century and a new library  On February 1, 1999 the Archives moved from its original location in what is now known as Nicks Hall to its present location on the fourth floor of the Charles C. Sherrod Library. With the move, the Archives acquired much-needed storage space for its rapidly growing collections. It also received increased space for its public reading room and dedicated facilities for its state-of-the-art media preservation lab. The relocation allowed the Archives to continue expanding its manuscript holdings and to extend both its educational and public services. In 2001, the Archives received a grant from the National Film Preservation Foundation to preserve and make prints of four film documentaries produced by ETSU professors Thomas Burton and Jack Schrader. Produced in the 1970s, the four films – “Buckwheat,” “Gandy Dancers,” “Ott Blair: Sled-maker,” and “Alex Stewart: Cooper” – examine traditional work and crafts as practiced in Appalachia and juxtapose these activities against the pressures of modernization. In 2002, the Archives acquired the Kenneth W. Smith Collection, consisting of 17,000 sound recordings of country and bluegrass music. In 2006, the Archives expanded its recorded sound collections once again with the acquisition of the Lewis Deneumoustier Collection, consisting of over 25,000 recordings along with a large number of publications and ephemera that focus on country and bluegrass music. Archives of Appalachia, Reading Room, Sherrod Library--alt= In July 2010, ETSU selected Amy Collins as the Archives’ fourth director after Norma Myers Riddle retired. Collections growth continued, and Collins placed an emphasis on formalizing a range of policies that clarified workflows and standardized collection development and research access. The Archives also officially initiated an education and outreach program in 2012, with the hiring of its first Education and Outreach Archivist. As a result of this program, additional resources were devoted to supporting student research and scholarship, including the creation of a new electronic classroom and student learning center in 2014. At the same time, Archives staff curated a major new permanent exhibit in the reading room, highlighting the broad range of scholarly and creative projects that the Archives’ collections have supported over time. Work digitizing collections also continued, as the Archives laid the groundwork for a partnership with the Sherrod Library’s Digital Commons to provide online access to official ETSU publications. Upon Collins’ retirement in 2018, ETSU selected Dr. Jeremy A. Smith as the Archives’ fifth director. Since that time the Archives has continued to emphasize digital access to collections, establishing its first digital collections portal in the summer of 2019, enhancing its infrastructure for digitizing oversize print items, and providing file-based streaming access to a portion of its media collections. The Archives has also enjoyed continued success in receiving grants, including two in 2019 from the Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation and the National Recording Preservation Foundation that allowed the Archives to enhance access to its recorded sound collections. In 2019 the Archives was also able to award its first research grants through the annual Margaret Anne Byrd Huffman Archives of Appalachia Endowment Grant which supports ETSU faculty members and students who utilize materials from the Archives in research or creative projects. As the Archives looks to the future, it remains grounded in its ongoing commitment to excellence and its dedication to serving the people of southern Appalachia. The Archives has a proud history as a center for education and creativity that engages students, faculty, and the broader Appalachian community in historical and cultural inquiry. Through its unrivaled collections, innovative and collaborative history of outreach, and patron-centered service, the Archives continues along its original path of serving southern Appalachia by preserving the stories of the people and the institutions that have made this region what it is.  Timeline  1958 Washington County deposits its official court records at East Tennessee State College. The College Library designates a space for the records, which becomes known informally as the library archives. This is the first of two foundational collections for the future Archives of Appalachia. (In 2011 this material is transferred to its permanent home at the Washington County Archives in Jonesborough, TN.) 1968-1972 ETSU professors Thomas G. Burton and Ambrose N. Manning create the Oral History Archives. This multiyear project documents Appalachian folklore, music, and customs, and it includes groundbreaking ethnographic work in the Appalachian region. This is the second of two foundational collections for the future Archives of Appalachia. September 2, 1978 East Tennessee State University founds the Archives of Appalachia to promote an awareness of and appreciation for southern Appalachia’s culture and history. 1978 ETSU hires Dr. Richard Kesner as the Archives’ first director. Kesner serves the institution from 1978-1981, laying a strong foundation of intentional collections growth and innovative outreach efforts. During these early years, the Archives receives manuscript, print, photographic, and media collections that document all aspects of life in Appalachia, laying the foundation for a collection that now extends from the 18th through the 21st centuries. Subjects include folk traditions, education, industry, transportation, religious practices, music, and the arts. 1979 ETSU formally establishes its University Archives as a division of the Archives of Appalachia with the transfer of the papers of the institution’s first three presidents: Sidney Gilbreath, Charles Sherrod, and Burgin Dossett. The Archives receives two grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) to develop its first major outreach project. Between 1979-1982 the Archives produces a series of nine multi-media outreach programs, along with study guides. The programs draw upon materials in the Archives’ collections and are presented hundreds of times to over 5,000 people for free throughout southern Appalachia. 1980 The Archives serves as a test facility for the SELGEM program (Self Generating Master) developed by the Smithsonian Institution for cataloging and indexing archival collections. The following year, the Archives is a part of an NEH-funded study of the use of computers in archival settings; one result of which is MARS (the Microcomputer Archives and Records Management System). 1982 Dr. Ellen Garrison joins the Archives as its second director. She coordinates a second major outreach program for the Archives titled “Tennessee’s Mountain Heritage.” This series of three radio shows, based on materials from the Archives’ holdings, provides an overview of various aspects of the social history and folklore of southern Appalachia. It airs on three separate Sunday evenings on the WETS radio station in May of 1983. 1984 ETSU receives a grant from the Tennessee Higher Education Commission (THEC) to establish the Center of Excellence for Appalachian Studies and Services (CASS). The Archives is one of three units of CASS, along with the Reece Museum and the Institute of Appalachian Affairs. Through this association, the Archives receives support for additional staff and equipment, as well as funding for a range of preservation and outreach projects. 1988 Norma (Myers) Riddle becomes the Archives’ third director. The Archives’ holdings continue their robust growth, adding hundreds of new collections on a range of historical and cultural topics related to southern Appalachia. Significant additions include: · the papers of the long-serving member of the US House of Representatives James H. Quillen · the Coal Employment Project Papers, which document the struggle for workers’ rights for female coal miners · the records of the East Tennessee & Western North Carolina Railroad · unique recorded sound collections including the Mary Elizabeth Barnicle and Tillman Cadle Collection of field recordings (1930s-1950s) and the Stoneman Family Papers. 1994 The Archives works with Panther Press to publish a two-volume series of hiking diaries from the D.R. Beeson, Sr. Papers. The series, edited by Norma Myers Riddle and Archivist, Ned Irwin, is titled In the Spirit of Adventure and features diary transcripts and photographs of hikes that D.R. Beeson and C. Hodge Mathes made of the Great Smoky Mountains (1914) and Mt. Mitchell (1915). 1996 The Archives launches its first homepage. 1997 The Archives participates in the “Monticello Electronic Library” pilot project, which is an attempt to make collection descriptions available online for 22 repositories in the southeast. 1998 The Archives receives a grant from the Grammy Foundation to preserve a portion of its media holdings. This is the first of nearly a dozen grants the Archives will receive over the next decade, totaling nearly $350,000, to preserve its collections. 1999 The Archives moves from its original location, in what is now known as Nicks Hall, to its present location on the fourth floor of the Charles C. Sherrod Library. This move gives the Archives much-needed space for collections storage, a larger reading room, and a dedicated facility for its state-of-the-art media preservation lab. 2000 The Archives achieves a milestone by making all of its collection finding aids available online. 2003 The Archives develops its in-house media digitization lab. Over time, the lab acquires the capacity for digitizing more than a dozen formats of analog audio and moving image materials, creating over 25 terabytes of digital files. 2004 The Archives produces a successful public film series that features rare films from its holdings, reaching over 1,500 people. 2010 ETSU selects Amy Collins as the Archives’ fourth director. The Archives formalizes a range of policies that clarify workflows and standardize collection development and research access. 2011 The Archives produces the DVD Ray Hicks and Other Beech Mountain Folks, featuring content from the Thomas Burton-Jack Schrader Film Collection. 2012 The Archives officially initiates an education and outreach program with the hiring of its first Education and Outreach Archivist. 2014 The Archives undergoes a significant facilities renovation that includes the creation of a new electronic classroom and student learning center, along with the curation of a major new permanent exhibit in the reading room that highlights the broad range of scholarly and creative projects that the Archives’ collections have supported over time. 2018 ETSU hires Dr. Jeremy A. Smith as the Archives’ fifth director. 2019 The Archives launches the Margaret Anne Byrd Huffman Archives of Appalachia Endowment Grant, which is awarded annually to support ETSU faculty members and students who utilize materials from the Archives in research or creative projects.

The name derived from Empress Marie-Louise who issued decrees dated 9 October 1813 ordering the conscription of 280,000 men but it has been extended more widely to those that served as conscripts between 1813 and 1815. Men were required at this stage of the war to defend against an anticipated invasion of north-east France by the Sixth Coalition. Owing to a manpower shortage the conscription was extended for the first time to those aged 18 and those as short as . Though they received as little as two weeks' training, commentators at the time have described the Marie-Louises as courageous. Despite this the French Army was too small to oppose the allies and, following the capture of Paris, Napoleon abdicated on 13 April 1814, bringing the war to a close. The Marie-Louises featured in subsequent art and literature, particularly after the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. The term was revived in 1914 to refer to French conscripts of the First World War.  Background  Louis-Léopold Boilly's Departure of the Conscripts in 1807 Conscription in France was based on the Jourdan-Delbrel law of 1798 which required a military obligation (not necessarily service under arms) from men between 20 and 25 years old. The time in service was set at 3 years though this was extended at the discretion of the state in wartime. It was inequally applied, the ratio of men conscripted varied between departments and even between cantons of the same department. The age at conscription was reduced to 19 in December 1806 and the army took volunteers as young as 18. Conscription was unpopular, particularly in rural areas where conscripts had little confidence of ever seeing their home village again. Resistance against conscription took hold in several regions and the authorities were forced to repress this by force in 1809–10. By 1813 Emperor of France Napoleon I's Grande Armée was severely depleted as a result of losses suffered in the unsuccessful 1812 invasion of Russia and the ongoing German Campaign as well as from diseases such as typhus. Napoleon considered that he was 110,000 soldiers short of those needed to defend France ahead of an anticipated invasion of north-east France by the Sixth Coalition. He decided to extend conscription in the Empire to supply the necessary men.  Levy decrees of 1813  A British cartoon by George Cruikshank of 1813 depicts Marie Therese and her son leading a procession of crippled and infirm conscripts. She is saying \\"Come Old & Young. Cripples, lame, blind deaf & dumb Napoleon wants you all at Dresden to bring him back to Paris\\". A British cartoon of 1813 satirising Napoleon's conscription acts of that year. The conscripts are shown as disorderly, short or crippled and include a drunken friar. At right the conscripted \\"Dutch Light Horse\\" are shown mounted on toads. Napoleon's extended conscription was achieved through a series of levy laws and decrees, including the extension of the levy to age groups previously exempted: *11 January 1813: 100,000 men (who reached the age of 20 in 1809, 1810, 1811 and 1812) *11 January 1813: 100,000 men into the National Guard. *11 January 1813: 150,000 men who would have reached the age of 20 in 1814. *3 April 1813: 80,000 men into the National Guard. *3 April 1813: 90,000 men who would have reached the age of 20 in 1814. * 3 April 1813: 10,000 men into the *24 August 1813: 30,000 men who had reached the age of 20 between 1808 and 1814 *9 October 1813: 120,000 men who would reach the age of 20 in or before 1814; later extended to 160,000 men. This levy decree was signed by the Empress Marie-Louise but believed to have originated from Napoleon. *9 October 1813: 160,000 who would reach the age of 20 in 1815; implementation postponed to January 1814. Also signed by the Empress. *15 November 1813; 300,000 men who would have reached the age of 20 between 1802 and 1814. In order to widen the pool of recruits the minimum height for conscripts was reduced to from (to which it had been reduced in 1810). Before the Napoleonic Wars the minimum height had been . In practice by 1814 the standard was merely nominal and in cases where conscripts had no other defects men shorter than were regularly accepted. During the year continuing campaigns and the bottling up of French garrisons in strongholds following the loss at the Battle of Leipzig also reduced the forces available to the Emperor. By the end of the year, Napoleon's field army had fallen to just 70,000 men, of whom only 30–50,000 were effective at any given time. The initial levies were a success in France until August when resistance began to appear. The levies in the occupied territories of Holland and Italy largely failed to meet their quotas and resulted in unrest. The October decrees of Marie-Louise did not respect the previous conventions of conscription, the exceptions being justified as necessary for le salut de la France (\\"the salvation of France\\"). The age at conscription was in some cases as low as 18, though such men were given assurances that they would not be deployed outside the boundaries of the Empire. Exemptions were allowed only for those physically incapable of service or who were the sole breadwinner for the family. The quota lottery, which allowed a portion of conscripts an exemption, was not used and the process was speeded up: conscripts would be posted to a regimental depot within 2 days of appearing before the conscription board. The required quotas were not derived from populations of the departments but seem to have been based on the deficits from previous levies in each region. Areas under allied occupation of threat thereof were exempted as was Corsica, due to its remoteness. The levy was postponed in Pas-de-Calais, Somme, Nord, Deux-Sèvres, Vendée, Loire- Inférieur due to previous or ongoing civil disturbance and were not implemented in Loir-et-Cher, Indre-et-Loire, Côtes-du-Nord, Finistère and Vienne as these departments were still working to fill previous levy quotas. In addition the levy was postponed in 24 Midi departments until 11 February and in practice did not actually take place until 26 March. The initial Marie- Louise levy was therefore limited to parts of South-East France, Lyon and the immediate vicinity of Paris, the 32 departments closest to existing depots. Despite this the October levy was reasonably successful, the city of Paris supplied a significant proportion of these men who were said to have been in the \\"best spirit\\". However, the large levy of November was a total failure. By mid-January 1814 the rate of supply of conscripts to the field army was very slow owing to a state of \\"confusion and disorder\\" in the French interior.  In service  The Battle of Champaubert, 10 February 1814 The Battle of Valjouan (Mormant), 17 February 1814 The number of men actually incorporated into the army from the Marie-Louise decrees has been estimated at only 25,000, of whom the majority (20,144) went into the Imperial Guard, mainly the Young Guard. They were initially incorporated gradually into the third battalions of the guard regiments but also formed the new 14e Regiment de Tirailleurs de la Garde Impériale, the 14e Régiment de Voltigeurs de la Garde Impériale and were incorporated into the guard artillery. The conscripts received a hurried and abbreviated training programme, though Napoleon specified that all conscripts should receive some form of musketry training, even if much shortened. A training period as short as a fortnight was not uncommon, with few receiving as much as a month's training; this was less than the conscripts called in 1813 who had, in principle, 90 days training before joining their regiments. The men were generally poorly trained in the traditional soldier's skills of marksmanship, drill and skirmishing; though some had earlier experience with muskets in civilian life as poachers. A Colonel Fabvier noted that the conscripts assigned to the Young Guard received better training than the rest. Napoleon recognised the limitations of poorly trained troops and requested that battalions formed entirely from conscripts be half the usual size to allow a better supervision ration from the units officers and non-commissioned officers. He employed such units as a means of holding static positions in his lines, though the Young Guard saw service as shock troops, deployed en masse in compact formations. Morale was variable but generally good, with few attempts at self-mutilation to escape service being recorded. Marshal Auguste de Marmont recalled his experience of this time: \\"The troops showed great value. Conscripts, arrived the day before, entered the line, and behaved, with courage, like old soldiers. ... one, very quiet under enemy fire, did not, however, use his rifle. I said to him, 'Why don't you shoot?'. He replied naively: 'I would shoot as well as any other soldier if I had someone to load my gun.' The poor child was so ignorant of his profession\\". The conscript units suffered high losses in the 1814 campaign (Napoleon said at the time \\"the Young Guard melts\\") and a reorganisation of the remnants of units was made on 12 March. By this time Napoleon's armies were too weak to resist the Sixth Coalition's invasion. Paris fell on 30–31 March and Napoleon retreated to Fontainebleau where he agreed to abdicate on 13 April, bringing the war to a close.  History of use of the term  The term is used as Marie-Louise in the singular and Marie-Louises or Maries-Louises in the plural. There is no precise historical definition for the name; historians are divided broadly into three camps. The most restrictive is that to those raised only in 1815 by the decrees of Empress Marie-Louise signed on 9 October 1813. Others use it to describe all conscripts of 1814 and 1815 and a third group for any of those conscripted between 1813 and 1815. The term now generally now applies to all young soldiers who served in the last years of the empire. The term is believed to have originated among the grognards of the Old Guard, as a manifestation of the black humour widespread in France towards the end of the war. Although common in the writings of military veterans such as Fabvier it was not picked up by military historians for many years. Houssaye, writing in the 1880s, was the first to use it to refer to individuals - earlier historians had referred only to \\"young conscripts\\" or \\"inexperienced conscripts\\". The use of the term, with its associations with popular support for the Imperial cause, declined over time as political attitudes changes in France. Few textbooks of the pre-First World War years make use of the term. However, it saw a resurgence in popularity in 1914-15 as men were called up for duty in that war and came to be applied to this class also. Houssaye's quotation was used during this time to refer to the fervour of the new conscripts but the conscripts of this war were far better trained than their forebears.  In art and literature  Meissonier's 1864 Campagne de France, 1814 depicts a column of conscripts in the background thumb The term did not find immediate use in works of art and literature. Even when depicting conscripts of the Napoleonic Era artists of the Bourbon Restoration such as Nicolas Toussaint Charlet and Auguste Raffet do not use the term. Indeed, the conscripts are not a popular subject for art of the time. This may have been because their simple uniform of hat, cape and musket was not visually appealing. one of the few pre-1870 depictions may be in Ernest Meissonier's 1864 Campagne de France, 1814 which may depict a column of conscripts in the background. Adolphe Lalauze's Le retour des dragons de l'armée d'Espagne (\\"the return of the dragoons from the Army of Spain\\") shows a group of Marie-Louises welcoming the cavalry recalled by Napoleon from Spain to the army in France. Depictions of the Marie-Louises in art increased after 1870 as the Franco- Prussian War inspired artists to draw upon the spirit of 1814. The first work of art to be named after the Marie-Louises was Pierre Victor Robiquet's Les Maries-Louises à Champaubert showing a unit of conscripts in square facing Russian cossacks at the 10 February 1814 Battle of Champaubert. Erckmann- Chatrian's 1864 novel Histoire d’un conscrit de 1813 and its sequel Waterloo has become associated with the Marie-Louises. The novels are anti- imperialistic and anti-militaristic and centre on an apprentice watchmaker from Phalsbourg who is conscripted into Napoleon's army. Other French literature from the 19th century tends to focus on volunteer soldiers. There are only two notable novels whose titles include \\"Marie-Louise\\": 2004 work Le \\"Marie-Louise\\" de l’Empereur, whose hero is actually a volunteer soldier at the Battle of Montereau and Edward Montier's 1911 Marie-Louises whose characters attempt to escape conscription but join the French army in its hour of need. There was a resurgence of interest in the Marie-Louises during the First World War, due to France once more calling upon conscripts when threatened with invasion. A monument at the site of the Battle of Craonne which honoured the original Marie-Louises was destroyed in fighting early in the war. It was replaced in 1927 with a new monument that honoured the conscripts of 1814 and those of 1914. Its central feature is a statue of an 1814 soldier and a 1914 poilu, who together hold up a French standard. The sculpture takes some artistic license in depicting the 1814 soldier in a standard 1812 army uniform, not the limited equipment that would have been worn by the typical 1814 conscript.

Although agriculture makes up only about 28 per cent of Nepal's GDP, it employs more than two-thirds of the workforce. Millions of men work as unskilled labourers in foreign countries, leaving the household, agriculture, and raising of children to women alone. Most of the working-age women are employed in agricultural sector, contributions to which are usually ignored or undervalued in official statistics. Few women who are employed in the formal sectors face discrimination and significant wage gap. Almost half of all children are economically active, half of which (almost a quarter of all children) are child labourers. Millions of people, men, women and children of both sexes, are employed as bonded labourers, in slavery-like conditions. Trade unions have played a significant role in earning better working conditions and workers' rights, both at the company level and the national government level. Worker-friendly labour laws, endorsed by the labour unions as well as business owners, provide a framework for better working conditions and secure future for the employees, but their implementation is severely lacking in practice. Among the highly educated, there is a significant brain-drain, posing a significant hurdle in fulfilling the demand for skilled workforce in the country. The Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security governs the development of labour and employment policies in Nepal. Overview Men prepare the paddy fields and women transplant rice seedlings (rural Nepal) Nepal is one of the least developed countries, with a severe shortage of skilled labour. The unemployment rate is high. Millions of unskilled labourers work abroad, primarily in the GCC countries and Malaysia, contributing around 28 per cent of the country's total GDP. On the other hand, thousands of well- educated and skilled workforce emigrates to the developed countries in the Americas, Europe and Australasia. As many as 66.5 per cent of men and 59.7 per cent of women employed in Nepal, are employed in the informal sector. According to the labour force survey of 2008, only 16.9 per cent of the employment was in wage employment, with the rest identifying as self-employed. Women in the workforce A Nepali woman scatters paddy with a hoe as another carrying a basketful of bricks passes by. According to Nepal labour force survey 2017-18, Nepal has 125 working-age women for every 100 such men. However, only 22.5 per cent of the working-age women are employed. Of the 11.53 million working-age women, 8.5 million are in the labour force (employed or seeking employment), with only 2.6 million of them actually employed. The low figure of employment is mostly attributed to the fact that women employed in subsistence farming (making no recorded profits) as well as homemakers were counted among the unemployed. Women form the majority of the workforce in the agricultural sector, most of which is ignored in the statistics. Because of continued outmigration of men from rural agricultural villages, women have been forced to take complete responsibility of the household which includes growing crops, animal husbandry, household chores and raising children. 73.9 per cent of the population employed in agriculture was composed of 84.3 per cent of all working women compared to 62.2 per cent for men. Women, on average, are paid 30 percent less salary compared to men, regardless of profession. Women are preferred for elementary level and non-technical jobs while men are hired for higher positions and technical jobs. There is a trend of hiring men for leadership positions and women as their deputies. Fewer women acquire higher or technical education and they are also subjected to \\"family penalty\\", discrimination based on the assumption that motherhood will lead to decreased productivity among women workers in the long term. Child labour Two Nepalese girls working in a brick factory carry sun-dried bricks on their heads. The incidence of child labour in Nepal is relatively high compared with other countries in South Asia. Nepal enacted the Child Labour Act 1992 and ratified the ILO Conventions no. 138 and 182, making child labour a criminal offence. However, in practice, millions of children are working as child labourers. According to the Nepal Labour Force Survey (NLFS) in 2008, 40.4 per cent of the child population was economically active, with 51 per cent of it being child labour. Brick factories are considered a hub for child labour in Nepal. According to a 2017 study, nearly 300,000 children were employed by the 1,100 brick factories throughout Nepal. A series of discussions between the brick factory owners and the government in 2018, led to the signing of an agreement to end child labour in the sector. The president of the Federation of Nepal Brick Industries expressed a commitment to end child labour by 2025. Some child labourers, particularly in the agricultural sector in the Terai and in the households of affluent families throughout the country, are employed in slavery-like conditions. Charuwa, a form of bonded child labour common in the Terai, has children employed as caretakers of cattle, who work up to 16 hours a day with no opportunity for education. Kamlaris, the young girls from western Terai who are employed as domestic helpers, having been auctioned off by their family to rich landlords, in a tradition now officially banned but alive in practice due to extreme poverty in the affected families, face inhumane living conditions, violence and abuse. On 9 July 2018, the federal government endorsed a 10-year \\"master plan\\" to end all child labour by 2028. Bonded labour Slavery was officially abolished by the Rana regime in 1925. However, bonded labour has persisted in Nepal, in other forms. =Kamaiya-kamlari system= In western Nepal, kamaiyas are male workers, usually of Tharu or Dalit caste groups, bonded to a landlord owing to debt whose interests mount at a rate higher than can be paid with labourer's wage; the indenture is inherited by the subsequent generations as the debt is never paid. It was abolished, and more than 11,000 labourers freed, in 2000. However, the system is believed to still persist in practice as many freed kamaiyas have begun returning to their former landlords, as law-enforcement isn't strict, and freed labourers lack other opportunities for livelihood. Kamlaris are young girls, as young as six, sold by their parents as indentured servants to higher-caste, land-owning families to repay debts. As the payment is made to the parents, the kamlaris are slaves to the landlord for the duration of the contract, and are subject to violence and abuse. Many kamlaris are sold off repeatedly each year, and so spend many years in slavery. The practice was officially banned in 2013, and more than 12,000 kamalaris freed, but it still exists in some parts of the country, as freed Kamlaris from families in extreme poverty have begun returning to their former landlords. =Haruwa-charuwa system= In the Terai, the Haruwa-Charuwa system which employs many bonded labourers includes indebted men called haruwas, who are employed to take care of the farms, mainly sowing, growing and harvesting crops in payment of debt or under unfair contracts, whose wife and children are also forced to work for the landlord, as domestic workers, cattle rearers and helpers in the farms, and children, usually of the haruwas, employed as charuwas, who take care of the cattle, cleaning the shed, milking and selling milk, gathering grass and fodder, taking the cattle for grazing (charuwa means \\"one who grazes cattle\\") and even helping out elsewhere when not busy with the cattle. =Haliya system= Haliyas are indentured labourers in the farms of the western hills, who are forced to work for other landowners as they are themselves landless, and are forced to incur debt from the landlords for their livelihood, which they can never completely repay due to the rates at which the interests accumulate. The whole family is bonded to the landlords, and the indentured status is passed from father to son for many generations. The system was abolished, and thousands of labourers freed, in 2008. However, due to the failure of the rehabilitation efforts, many haliyas are reported to have gone back to their former landlords to make their living. Immigrant labour Indians make up the bulk of the immigrant labour force. Indian workers were exempt from requiring a work permit to live and work in Nepal until 2019. So, Nepal does not have any data on the number of Indians living and working in Nepal. However, the Indian government puts the number of non-resident Indians in Nepal at 600,000. Most of the workers from India and rest of South Asia are usually employed in unskilled or low-skilled jobs. In recent years, the number of immigrants from South Asia and elsewhere, applying for a work permit for employment in high-skilled jobs has been increasing. These workers number a few thousands, almost half of them from China, while the United Kingdom is at distant second. Labour laws =Minimum wage= The Social Security Act that came into force in 2017 set minimum monthly wage for industrial workers at Rs 13,450, a daily minimum wage at Rs 517, and an hourly minimum at Rs 69. Minimum additional entitlements include provident fund and gratuity contributions worth 18.33 per cent of basic wage, festival allowances worth 8.33 per cent of basic wage, as well as planned increases to maternity support, health and accident insurances, taking the total minimum additional entitlements to around Rs 2,500. =Worker safety and welfare= Any enterprise with more than 20 employee must establish a Health and Safety Committee with representation from the workers. Enterprises with more than 50 employees are required to provide a break room and canteen, whereas a child care center is mandated, either by itself or jointly with another, for companies that employ more than 50 female workers. =Foreign workers= An enterprise may employ foreign workers not exceeding 5 per cent of the total workforce. Labour permit may be obtained for a maximum of 3 to 5 years depending on the skill level, with a potential for extension of up to two additional years from the Ministry of Labour. History of labour laws Labour Act 2048 was enacted following the re-establishment of democracy through the People's movement 1990. Labour Rules 2050 (1993) provided additional guidance on the Labour Act 2048. Labour Act 2048 was repealed by Nepal Labour Act 2074, enacted in 2017, following the establishment of the federal republic and drafting of the new constitution. The new Labour Act also repealed Retirement Fund Act 2042 (1985) and Industrial Trainee Act 2039 (1982). Labour Rules 2075 which provides additional guidance on the Labour Act 2074 was enacted on 27 May 2018. It repealed and replaced Labour Rules 2050 as the supplement to the Labour Act. Labour unions and worker rights The history of worker rights campaigns and trade unions in Nepal, begins with the Biratnagar Mills Workers' Association, which under the leadership of democratic revolutionaries from Nepali Congress and Communist Party of Nepal, were able to organise a strike for the first time on 4 March 1947, beginning the revolution for democracy that successfully toppled the Rana regime and established constitutional monarchy in 1951. In the short term, they were successful in persuading the Rana regime to increase their wages by 15 per cent, and full wages for the duration of the strike. After the establishment of democracy, the union split into All Nepal Trade Union Congress and Nepal Trade Union Congress, and rapidly polarised as leftist and non-leftist during the cold war. Many independent industry-based workers' unions came into being in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the tourism, transport and hospitality sectors. On 20 July 1989, most of these unions came together to form the General Federation of Nepalese Trade Unions (GEFONT). By 1996, the CPN UML affiliated GEFONT and Nepali Congress affiliated Nepal Trade Union Congress (NTUC) were the only two recognised confederations of trade unions. After the maoist party entered the peace process in 2006, its affiliate trade union, the All Nepal Federation of Trade Unions (ANFTU) entered as the third major trade union confederation. However, following the merger of CPN UML and CPN (Maoist Centre), GEFONT and ANFTU are in the process of negotiating a merger. Trade unions work together with investors, NGOs, INGOs and the government in developing policies, laws, rules and regulations related to worker welfare.

According to Article 173 of the Custom of Paris, a bourgeois had to have possess a domicile in Paris as a tenant or owner for at least a year and a day. This qualification was also required for public offices such as provost of the merchants, alderman or consul, but unlike the bourgeois or citizens of other free cities, Parisians did not need letters of bourgeoisie to prove their status. A bourgeois of Paris had privileges as well as duties. While they were exempt from paying the taille, they were required to pay the city taxes, contribute to a public charity, arm themselves at their own expense, and join the urban militia.  Definition  According to article 173 (previously 129) of the Custom of Paris, the \\"right of the Bourgeoisie\\" can be attained in Paris by any person \\"living and residing there for a year and a day.\\" \\"Living and residing\\" meant having a personal home and staying there continuously with family as opposed to making temporary stays for business; this was proven by a receipt of rent or personal capitation. Renting a room or staying in a furnished hotel was not considered. Unlike the bourgeois or citizens of other free cities, Parisians did not need letters of bourgeoisie to prove their status. Anyone who owned a home in Paris intra-muros as an owner or tenant and had resided there for over a year was considered a bourgeois of Paris. There were no other conditions such as heritage or an oath, unlike in Brussels at the same period.  Duties and privileges of the Bourgeois of Paris  The privileges of the Bourgeois of Paris were numerous and diverse and varied greatly from decade to decade. The list published in 1884 in L'Intermédiaire des chercheurs et curieux (The Intermediate of the Researchers and Curious) gives a glimpse into the variety of these privileges. Laurence Croq, who dedicated a thesis to studying the Bourgeois of Paris in the 18th century, explains that this status had a polymorphous characteristic.Laurence Croq, Les « Bourgeois de Paris » au xviiie siècle. Identification d'une catégorie sociale polymorphe, Université de Paris-I, 1998 (). The first privilege of the Bourgeois of Pari was being allowed their own set of custom rules: the Coutume de Paris. The second privilege of the Bourgeois of Paris was the right for merchants to be organized into bodies. These bodies received certain privileges from the king, such as the right to have a seal, a common fund, and a \\"parlor for Bourgeois\\" (city hall); the right to defend itself, to close itself, and to administer itself; and the right to have its own justice and its own police force. = Privilege of jurisdiction = According to Article 112 of the Custom of Paris, the Bourgeois of Paris cannot be forced to plead in defense anywhere other than Paris, including in civil matters for purely real rights. = Fiscal privileges = Fiscal privileges were numerous; those maintained until the Meeting of the Estates-General in 1789 included: * Exemption from the Taille, including income from property in the countryside in the jurisdiction of the Vicomté de Paris (the Bourgeois of Versailles, Poissy, Lyons, Amiens, Bordeaux, and several other large cities had the same privilege); * Exemption from the right of freehold, granted by Charles VI in July 1409 and suppressed by Louis XV; * Right to wholesale the wine of one's own home without the ministry of jurés-crieurs and without being required to register the sale, and to import it into Paris without paying the tariffs; * Exemption from the mortmain and the right of mortmain on a property in mortmain throughout the kingdom. * = Some privileges identical to those of the Nobility = The Bourgeois of Paris were given some privileges almost equal to the nobility's, the oldest being the exemption from mortmain, from the Taille,L'Intermédiaire des chercheurs et curieux, 1864, ibidem. and freehold to benefit from the noble guard. At an early period, the Bourgeois of Paris received the right to wear a helmet and/or crested coats of armsClaude de Ferrière, Des droits de patronage, Paris chez Nicolas Le Gras, 1686, p. 545 : « Par un privilège spécial il est permis aux Bourgeois de Paris, par Lettres Patentes du Roy Charles V. du 9 Août 1391, de se servir des ornemens appartenant à l'état de Chevalerie, et de porter les Armes Tymbrées, ainsi que les Nobles d'extraction » ; Répertoire universel et raisonné de jurisprudence civile, criminelle, canonique et bénéficiale, Paris, tome premier, 1784, p. 613 : « On observera seulement que, par cet édit, les bourgeois de Paris sont maintenus dans le droit de porter des Armoiries timbrées » ; A.-L. d' Harmonville, Dictionnaire des dates, des faits, des lieux et des hommes historiques, 1843, tome II, p. 757 ; Joseph Nicolas Guyot, Répertoire universel et raisonné de jurisprudence civile, 1784 : « Par une chartre du 9 Août 1370, Charles V donna à tous les bourgeois de Paris les privilèges de la Noblesse, avec permission d'avoir des armoiries timbrées, de tenir des fiefs et des alleux dans toute l'étendue du royaume...... ». and to carry a sword from King Charles V.L'Intermédiaire des chercheurs et curieux, 1864 : « Les privilèges sont l'exemption de la taille, le port de l'épée, les armoiries timbrées, le titre de bourgeois de Paris ... » According to Chateaubriand, \\"Charles V granted letters of nobility to all the Bourgeois of Paris; Charles VI, Louis XI, Francis I and Henry II confirmed these letters of nobility. Paris was never a commune because it was franc by the mere presence of the king.\\"Chateaubriand, Analyse raisonnée de l'Histoire de France, p. 311. Henry III restricted this privilege in 1577 to the Provost of the Merchants and the Aldermen alone. It was suppressed in 1667, restored in 1707, suppressed again in 1715, and finally restored in 1716, which remained until the end of the Ancien Régime.François Alexandre Aubert de La Chesnaye-Desbois, Dictionary of the nobility, Foreword, Volume I, Paris, 1770, p. IX. The Bourgeois of Paris also enjoyed the right to the noble guard, who were called the Bourgeois guard when serving them.  Birth of the bourgeoisie in Paris  The oldest corporations or guilds in Paris were the clothiers, grocers, haberdashers, and furriers. The water merchants, heirs of the \\",\\" monopolised the Basilica of Saint-Denis and the Grande Boucherie (lit. Big Butchery) and constituted a third power along with the clergy and the French nobility that consecrated the Great Ordinance of the provost of merchants in 1357 In 1190, before leaving for a crusade, King Philippe Auguste wrote his will and placed six \\"loyal men\\" at the head of the provosts: Thibaut Le Riche, Athon de Greve, Evrouin Le Changeur, Robert de Chartres, Baudouin Bruneau and Nicolas Boucel.Alfred Fierro, Histoire et dictionnaire de Paris, Éditions Robert Laffont, coll. « Bouquins », 1996, 1 590 p. (). The Livre des métiers (Book of trades) and the Livre de la taille (Book of the taille), written under provost Étienne Boileau, allow readers to learn about the rising status of the Bourgeoisie. Holders of registered occupations were considered to be Bourgeois. During the 13th century, numerous Bourgeois dynasties were built, including the Sarrazins, Barbettes, Bourdonnais (see rue des Bourdonnais), and Pisdoe or Pizdoue.

It was previously scheduled to air live on TNT on March 25, 2020, but was postponed indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It will feature the first-ever Blood and Guts match, which was originally announced to have Matt Hardy (replacing a then-injured Nick Jackson) team with The Elite (Adam Page, Cody, Kenny Omega, and Matt Jackson) to face The Inner Circle (Chris Jericho, Jake Hager, Sammy Guevara, Santana and Ortiz); however, the aftermath of September's All Out event may affect the participants of the match. Production =Background= On July 25, 2019, professional wrestling promotion WWE conducted a conference call as a publicly traded company to announce its second-quarter fiscal year 2019 results. During the call, Eric Katz of Wolfe Research, LLC, asked WWE Chief Executive Officer Vince McMahon questions regarding naming Eric Bischoff and Paul Heyman as Executive Directors to WWE and its relationship to the future of WWE content, especially with stricter Broadcast Standards and Practices at the Fox network for SmackDowns upcoming move to broadcast television. McMahon responded to Katz's question: The term \\"blood and guts\\" used by McMahon was perceived as a reference to rival wrestling promotion All Elite Wrestling (AEW).https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/27427663/what-need-know-nxt-move- usa-network On November 13, 2019, AEW filed a trademark for \\"Blood and Guts,\\" a play on McMahon's term. During Revolution on February 29, 2020, AEW announced that the March 25 episode of Dynamite would be subtitled Blood and Guts, and feature the promotion's first WarGames match, but called a \\"Blood and Guts match\\" since the WarGames trademark is owned by WWE. The WarGames match features two rings enclosed by a steel cage and was developed by wrestler Virgil Runnels, better known as \\"The American Dream\\" Dusty Rhodes, the father of AEW executive vice president and in-ring talent Cody. The event was originally scheduled to take place on March 25, 2020 at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey, but was moved to an undisclosed location due to concerns stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 20, AEW President and CEO Tony Khan announced that the event had been postponed, stating that Blood and Guts would \\"happen when the time is right\\" and that a regular episode of Dynamite would instead air on March 25. =Storylines= Blood and Guts will feature professional wrestling matches that involve different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portray heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that build tension and culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches. Storylines are produced on AEW's weekly shows Dynamite and Dark and The Young Bucks' YouTube series Being The Elite . Following the announcement of Blood and Guts and the namesake match, on March 8, AEW announced The Elite, composed of Adam Page, Cody, Kenny Omega and The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson) would face The Inner Circle (Chris Jericho, Jake Hager, Sammy Guevara, Santana and Ortiz) in the match. However, Nick Jackson was attacked backstage by The Inner Circle on the March 11 episode of Dynamite, injuring him indefinitely and taking him out of the match (the character was written out of the storyline, as Nick Jackson legitimately entered paternity leave, as his wife was expecting their third child). On the March 18 episode of Dynamite, The Elite revealed that the debuting Matt Hardy would take Jackson's place in the match. The rules for the Blood and Guts match are based on the classic WarGames format from Jim Crockett Promotions, and not the modern WWE format. The notable format differences between the classic Crockett rules and the modern WWE rules are an enclosed cage with a roof (which was removed in modern versions) and the match can only be won with a submission or surrender. Like the classic Crockett format, a pin situation is not a win condition.

In 2007 he became a Senior Group Leader at the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute, leading the Functional Genomics of Ovarian Cancer laboratory.  Research  Brenton's research focuses on understanding the molecular complexity of ovarian cancer to improve treatment and patient outcome. His team discovered a ubiquitous TP53 mutation in high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), the most common form of ovarian cancer, which was adopted as a critical marker for diagnosing HGSOC by the World Health Organisation. Brenton used this TP53 discovery to develop personalised circulating tumour DNA assays to measure treatment response in ovarian cancer. In 2015, his team was the first to measure the tumour heterogeneity in a solid tumour and link this to cancer survival, finding that HGSOC was more deadly if it consisted of a patchwork of different groups of cells. In 2018, Brenton published the first national effort to investigate cancer evolution in HGSOC, discovering seven distinct genetic patterns that could predict disease behaviour in response to treatment. This led to the BriTROC-2 study, funded by Ovarian Cancer Action, to create new, personalised treatments for women with HGSOC.

The city had fallen under the control of four sheikhs in 1915 after an anti-Ottoman uprising, and was put under British control in 1917. In 1918, as it became clear that the British were aiming to occupy, not liberate, Iraq, an anti-British movement named Jam'iya al-Nahda al-Islamiya was formed in Najaf to oppose British rule. The uprising began on 19 March when Captain Marshall was murdered in the citadel of Najaf. The British subsequently laid siege to the city on 23 March, denying access to food and water before the city ultimately surrendered on 4 May 1918. Rebel leaders were sentenced to death on 25 May. The extent of the rebellion's impact on the development of Iraqi nationalism is disputed.  Background  Following the Ottoman defeat in the Battle of Shaiba in mid-April 1915, the Ottoman authority in the eyes of Mesopotamian Arabs had been shattered.Charles Townsend, Desert Hell, The British Invasion of Mesopotamia (Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 2010), 90-91. In the city of Najaf, locals felt confident enough to begin directly challenging local Ottoman authority, and were ready for an open revolt. There are 2 different accounts as to how the revolt began: According to the first account, after Ottoman troops forced women to lower their veils while turning over every last rock in pursuit of the absent men, resentments finally boiled over on 22 May as rebels laid siege to government buildings and the army barracks, erected checkpoints, and even tore up the telegraph poles for several miles to prevent any relief from reaching the garrison. After a 3-day long gun battle, the Ottoman governor in Baghdad negotiated the safe withdrawal of the soldiers stationed in the city. According to the second account, a survivor of the Battle of Shaiba, Karim al Haji Sa'ad, entered the town, which was under martial law at the time, with 30 men through a hole in the wall and resisted Ottoman attempts to retake Najaf for 24 hours, before help allowed him to secure the city, leading the Ottoman troops present to withdraw. Charles R. H. Tripp notes that although the revolt was anti-Ottoman in a broad sense, the uprising was not in support of the British war effort and instead intended to grant the city higher administrative autonomy. In either case, the rebels had secured for themselves an independent city under the rule of 4 different sheikhs of the Zuqurt and Shumurt: Saiyid Mahdi al Saivid Salman, Haji ‘Atiyah Abu Qulal, Kadhim Subhi and Haji Sa‘ad ibn Haji Radhi. The sheikhs regularly looted from the citizens of Najaf under the justification of taxation. Najaf continued to trade with the Ottoman Empire while simultaneously strengthening its relations with Britain. All sources agree that the British captured Najaf in 1917, but disagree on the details: According to Abbas Kadhim, Najaf's independence ended in July 1917 when the British appointed captain Francis Balfour as political officer for Shamiyya and Najaf. According to British Documents, British rule began in August 1917 when Hamid Khan was appointed as the first government agent. According to Keiko Sakai, the pro-British Anaza tribe migrated to the vicinity of Najaf in October 1917, and when they were attacked by the Najafis for refusing to pay taxes, the British sent a force to directly assume control. In early January 1918, a small number of British troops arrived in Kufa, which likely led the Najafi sheikhs to believe they were hard-pressed in other fronts. In mid-January, a British cavalry patrol was fired on by Najafis, and when the British demanded an explanation on 14 January, the Najafi sheikhs instead began attacking British posts and troops in Najaf, marking the start of an open revolt. Since the sheikhs were unable to mobilize popular support in Najaf, the British were able to swiftly recapture the city on 19 January, ending the first revolt. Najaf was given a fine of 50,000 rs and 500 rifles, which the sheikhs paid by looting from the citizens. However, tensions between Arabs and the British rose as it became increasingly clear that the British were aiming to occupy, not liberate, Iraq. This was clear from the new taxation system and the appointment of political officers to each area. In that year an anti-British organization in Najaf named Jam'iya al- Nahda al-Islamiya was established. The leadership of Jam'iya al-Nahda al- Islamiya at this time were divided of whether or not to launch a revolt. A bazaar trader named Haji Najm al-Baqqal, who was a major member of the organization, hoped that a daring act of violence would provoke the entire city, or possibly even the entire country into an open revolt against Britain.  Uprising and siege  In the morning of 19 March 1918, a number of Najafis led by Haji Najm al-Baqqal disguised as Shabanah, the British-paid Arab police, entered the citadel of Najaf where they murdered Captain W. M. Marshall, who had been stationed in the city since 1 February 1918. They were subsequently driven out of the citadel by members of the Punjabi guard, who then found themselves besieged by members of Jam'iya al-Nahda al-Islamiya. The initial revolt was co-led by Najaf's chief sheikh, Abu Qulal. The uprising was also supported by Kadhim Subhi, sheikh of Buraq, and Sa‘ad ibn Haji Radhi, sheikh of Mushraq. Only the sheikh of Huwaysh, Saivid Salman, opposed the uprising, due to his personal rivalry with Abu Qulal. British Captain Francis Balfour, stationed in Kufah, responded by evacuating half the police, while the other half sought refuge in al Saivid Salman's house. The rebels presented a set of demands to the British, voicing a desire to govern themselves without British interference. On 23 March, 4 days after the uprising began, the British began to besiege the city, surrounding the city with barbed wire. Residents were denied access to food and water. The Najafis took possession of a group of mounds, collectively known as Tel Huwaysh, and manned the city walls and bastions with troops armed mainly with abandoned Turkish rifles. The British put forth 4 demands: * The unconditional surrender of certain persons known to be the ringleaders and supposed to be among the attacking party. * A fine of 1,000 rifles * A fine of Rs. 50,000 * Deportation of 100 persons to India as prisoners of war ** Until the above conditions are fulfilled the town will be blockaded and the food and water supply will be cut off Over the next 2 weeks, sporadic rifle fire was exchanged between the British and Najafi forces while the siege was increasingly tightened. The Najafis tried to seek help from the tribes, but their messenger was caught crossing British lines, and executed. On 7 April, the British launched a large artillery barrage and captured the Huwaish mounds dominating the town with 2 Indian battalions and evacuated officials. Unable to endure the siege, the rebels finally surrendered on 4 May and the blockade was declared at an end. Rebel leaders were sentenced to death on 25 May.  Aftermath  After the failure of the revolt, one of the uprising's ringleaders wrote the following poem prior to facing execution: The uprising in Najaf was limited, local and short-lived. But the Iraqis had learned an important lesson: they could not successfully overthrow the British without involvement of the tribes. A new uprising in 1920 would be much larger in scope and duration, but would nonetheless still be ultimately suppressed by the British.  Historiography  Traditional Iraqi historiography sees the 1918 uprising in Najaf as a \\"test-run\\" of the later Iraqi revolt against the British. This is part of a nationalist narrative of early-modern Iraqi history that seeks to place major events under an all-encompassing drive towards Iraqi independence. However, this view is contested by Fanar Haddad, who states that the \\"Najafi rebellion was a localized affair that fed off the anti British sentiments of the jihad movement. In other words, what ideological motivation that accompanied the rebellion still revolved around the Muslim– infidel dichotomy.\\" and that they fought as \\"Arab Muslims or Najafi Muslims but not yet as primarily Iraqi Muslims\\". To support his view, he notes that the initial Najafi demands to the British did not contain any mention of Iraq. However, he does not believe that the rebellion was completely unrelated to the formation of Iraqi nationalism, saying that the rebellion \\"strengthened anti-British sentiment and added to a sense of collective grievance against the British\\".

In anti-Semitic laws, ordinances and decrees, the term \\"jüdisch versippt\\" is usually paraphrased so that it could be clearly determined whether \\"half Jews\\" (first-degree Jewish hybrids) were being referred to in addition to the so-called \\"full Jews\\". Radical anti-Semites agitated against their legal betterment and often succeeded in including the \\"German-blooded\\" partner married to a \\"half-Jew\\" in persecution measures. Joseph Goebbels also intended to exclude the cultural workers who were married to a \\"Jewish half-breed of the second degree\\" (quarter Jews).  Uncertainty of the term  The first legal definition of the term \\"non-Aryan\\" can be found in the First Ordinance on the Implementation of Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service of 11 April 1933 (RGBl. I, p. 195): \\"Anyone who descends from non-Aryan, especially Jewish, parents or grandparents shall be deemed non-Aryan. It is sufficient if one parent or one grandparent is not Aryan\\" This definition was decisive in the first phase of discrimination from 1933 to 1935. The broad interpretation of the term \\"not Aryan\\" led to the stigmatization of \\"half-Jews\\" and \\"quarter Jews\\" as well as \\"full Jews\\". Accordingly, the derogatory term \\"jüdisch versippt\\" was also be interpreted as such. It was not until November 1935, when further rules were written in the First Ordinance to the Reich Citizenship Act, that the discrimination of all \\"non-Aryans\\" ended. \\"Jewish hybrids\\" were legally better off. Until 1937, \\"Jewish hybrids\\" remained unchallenged with regard to their economic activities and largely unaffected by the prohibitions and restrictions on professions directed against \\"non-Aryans\\". \\"Second-degree Jewish hybrids\\" were placed on an almost equal legal footing with Aryans. Later laws and ordinances directed against \\"arisch Versippte\\" (Aryan infested) only exceptionally concerned those \\"Aryans\\" who were married to a \\"quarter Jew\\".  Before the Nuremberg Laws (1935)  The first legal provision restricting the professional existence of the German-blooded partner in a mixed marriage was enacted on 30 June 1933 and concerned prospective civil servants. After that, it was not allowed to appoint a Reich civil servant who was \\"married to a person of non-Aryan descent\\". A later marriage to a \\"person of non-Aryan descent\\" resulted in the dismissal. On 6 September 1933, the General Synod of the Evangelical Church of the Old Prussian Union passed a church law concerning the legal relations of clergy and church officials. Accordingly, clergy and officials of the general church administration who were married to a person of \\"non-Aryan descent\\" were to be retired. The \\"non-Aryan descent\\" was defined according to the First Ordinance on the Implementation of the Restoration of Professional Civil Service (RGBl 1933 I, p. 195): It was sufficient if \\"one parent or one grandparent\\" was considered \\"not Aryan\\". After protest by the Pfarrernotbund, Reich Bishop Ludwig Müller suspended this church law on 16 November 1933 and passed a law on 8 December 1933 on the \\"legal relationships of clergy and civil servants of the regional churches\\", which no longer contained an Aryan paragraph.  Inconsistent definition  In August 1936, Reich Minister of the Interior Wilhelm Frick defined in a letter to the higher instances: \\"A \\"jüdisch versippt\\" person is one who is married to a Jewish woman (a Jew) in the sense of § 5 of the First Decree to the Reich Citizenship Law is considered to be Jewish in disguise\\". In the German Civil Servants' Law of 26 August 1936, Wilhelm Frick wrote one higher on instances of the Reich to the effect that \\"a person who is married to a Jewish woman (a Jew) in the sense of § 5 of the First Decree to the Reich Citizenship Law is considered to be Jewish. In addition, on 26 January 1937, applicants married to a \\"half-Jew\\" were excluded as a matter of principle: \\"Only persons who are of German or related blood and, if they are married, have a spouse of German or related blood can become civil servants. If the spouse is a second degree hybrid, an exception may be granted\\". Radical anti-Semitic forces within the NSDAP attempted to abolish all preferential treatment of \\"first-degree Jewish hybrids\\" They repeatedly succeeded in including in discriminatory measures also those \\"Jews who were married to a so-called \\"half-Jew\\". In a questionnaire distributed by the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin in 1938, for example, it was stated: \\"As jüdisch versippt is the one man whose wife is Jewish or a Jewish half-breed.\\" A memorandum from the party chancellery in the spring of 1944 contained the suggestion that \\"jüdisch Versippte\\" who were married to \\"first-degree half-breeds\\" would not be allowed to work as self-employed businessmen, craftsmen or factory owners after the end of the war.  Job restriction  Since autumn 1935, Joseph Goebbels had been striving for a consistent \\"de-Jewification\\" of the Reich Chamber of Culture. On 6 March 1936, guidelines had been issued on the exclusion or non- admission of Jews, which also concerned \\"Full Jews and three-quarter Jews of the jüdisch Versippte\\". Already at the end of 1936 Goebbels tightened this directive in strict confidence by now also including \\"all persons married to half and quarter Jews\\". The \\"cleansing\\" lasted longer than expected. In 1937 there were still 156 Jewish members in the Reichskunstkammer, mostly art dealers and art journalists. In 1938 Goebbels complained about difficulties with the Reichsmusikkammer. In February 1939 at least 21 \\"not fully-Aryan\\" and \\"jüdisch versippte\\" actors and film actors were still busy with his toleration. On 4 May 1943, Goebbels noted in his diary that the Reich Chamber of Culture was \\"not as de-jewified as I had actually intended\\"; however, he did not want to tackle this problem any more during the war. At the end of 1938, the Reichsärzteführer determined until further notice that no German who was married to a Jewish woman or a Jewish half-breed could be appointed as a doctor.  Wehrmacht  \\"Jüdisch Versippte\\" could not attain a higher rank in the Wehrmacht than that of a Feldwebel. On 8 April 1940, \\"jüdisch Versippte\\" who were married to \\"first-degree half-breeds\\" or even \\"full Jews\\" were generally excluded from the Wehrmacht, unless they had distinguished themselves particularly. This decree was slowly implemented at first.[19] Finally, according to the decree of 25 September 1942, even the \\"tried and tested and distinguished\\" who had been spared so far were to be dismissed. In 1944, proposals for the award of orders and decorations had to include the assurance that the person to be awarded was \\"purely Aryan and not married to a Jew or a first-degree hybrid\\".  Forced labour  In October 1943 Fritz Sauckel commissioned the Gauarbeitsämter to organize the forced deployment of the \\"non-defensive half-Jews\\" and the \\"Aryans married to fully Jewish women\\". These forced laborers were initially to be deployed separately in camps of the Organization Todt in France. Many companies important to the war complained about their employees and undermined this order. In October 1944, Heinrich Himmler then ordered all men of the groups defined as such, who were fit for service, to be transferred within three days to construction battalions of the Organisation Todt. In principle, these forced laborers were deployed in separate columns outside their home towns. The kidnapping took place under the camouflage name Sonderkommando J and is regarded by the historian Ursula Büttner as the victory of the \\"race experts\\" of the NSDAP: \\"Jüdisch Versippte\\", who in spite of all pressure held to their Jewish spouses unswervingly, were now assigned to the Jews.

It primarily focuses on the character of Wade Tillman, the masked police detective who goes by the name Looking Glass. Synopsis On November 2, 1985, Wade Tillman is in Hoboken, New Jersey when the psychic wave from the sudden appearance of a giant squid in New York City strikes. Tillman is one of the few survivors but becomes traumatized and paranoid for life. In the present, 2019, Laurie instructs the Tulsa police to search for the church in the Seventh Kavalry videos. Laurie informs Wade she bugged his desk and overheard Wade talking to Angela about a bottle of pills and needs to know what he tells Angela. The next day, Wade visits his ex-wife Cynthia, a biomedical researcher. Cynthia reveals the pills as Nostalgia, illegal pills that let one experience the memories of someone else. Wade is lured to an abandoned building by the Seventh Kavalry, where he finds the set of the church in the videos and the Kavalry testing a teleportation device. One Kavalry member reveals himself as Senator Joe Keene Jr. Joe explains both he and Judd Crawford led different parts of the Kavalry to keep them in check, and coerces Wade to learn from Angela what she knows of Judd's murderer. In exchange, Joe lets Wade watch a video that has been shown to only a select few. The video, made by Adrian Veidt on November 1, 1985, explains his staging of the squid attack to future President Robert Redford, and his need for the President's help in some long- term plan. Wade's core is rocked. At the station, he brings Angela to his desk to return the pills and tell her what they are, and asks her what she knows about Judd's death. She tells him that Will, her grandfather, did it, unaware of Laurie's audio bug. Laurie comes out to arrest Angela, but Angela quickly takes all the Nostalgia before she is dragged to prison. Wade returns home, unaware of a group of Kavalry with guns following him to his house. Meanwhile, Adrian Veidt is assisted by his clones of Phillips and Crookshanks into a survival suit tied to a lifeline, and then launched by catapult out of his prison. He emerges on Jupiter's Europa among numerous corpses of other Phillips and Crookshanks. He uses their bodies to write out a message \\"SAVE ME D” visible to a nearby satellite. The Game Warden yanks him back by his lifeline, and informs Veidt he is under arrest. Production This episode prominently focuses on Tim Blake Nelson's character, revealing the origins of Looking Glass. The episode opens with the climatic scene from the limited series of the 1985 appearance of the giant squid in New York City, which killed millions from the psychic blast from its arrival. Damon Lindelof, the series' showrunner and writer, wanted the television series to bring to life some of the limited series' imagery, including the aftermath of the squid attack, before production started. The sequence ends on a pull-back from Hoboken to downtown New York City, which used a mixed of practical and special effects. The scenes set in Hoboken were filmed in Atlanta, while the rest was computer generated imagery to show the chaos of the blast. The size of the squid was not clear from the limited series as it only appears in a few panels, but Lindelof wanted the creature to be as tall as a five-story building. The effects team took much of the imagery from the limited series to incorporate into this sequence, such as tentacles from the squid appearing embedded in buildings, while keeping it to a realistic look. With the squid sequence planned, Lindelof came onto the idea that it would have long-lasting emotional effects on people like PTSD, which would have been a necessary element of Veidt's plan to prevent the nations from regressing back to a nuclear war long after the event. This led to the creation of Wade Tillman/Looking Glass as a person that continued to suffer from the PTSD of the squid attack. Lindelof likened Looking Glass' reflective mask as someone literally wrapping themselves in a tin foil hat. Lindelof used fear as a major theme behind Looking Glass's character, not only in reaction to the squid attack, but as well as the trauma he suffered from being caught in a compromising sexual situation just prior to it, compounded by the squid attack. Lindelof created that situation based his own experiences from when he was a teenager, having been scared about sex knowing others of his age were far more confident about it. Of the Veidt storyline, Lindelof asserted that they needed some type of \\"prison\\" for Veidt that he would not be able to easily escape from as the smartest man on Earth, and selected Europa to be the prison's setting. The episode's title is taken from a passage in Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, \\"If there were no thunder, men would have little fear of lightning.\\" The episode features an uncredited cameo from Michael Imperioli, playing himself in an advertisement for New York City tourism. Reception =Critical response= \\"Little Fear of Lightning\\" received positive reviews from critics, with several considering it the series' best episode to date. On Rotten Tomatoes, the episode has an approval rating of 100% with an average score of 8.89 out of 10, based on 28 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Along with the Lovecraftian inspired Giant Squid attack, Looking Glass's heartbreaking story adds much-needed momentum in 'Little Fear of Lightning'.\\" Siddhant Adlakha of IGN called the episode \\"a near-perfect hour of television\\" by heavily tying into the limited series, the focus on Wade's character, and helping to push the series' overall narrative along. Rolling Stone Alan Sepinwall praised Lindelof's vision for the episode, remarking on how his previous work on The Leftovers helped to influence this, and that the episode \\"fills in a huge chunk of the mythology, while also doing that thing that both Alan Moore and Damon Lindelof do so well: looking at an utterly outrageous sci-fi/fantasy construct and wondering how a very real and fragile human being might respond to it.\\" =Accolades= For the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards, Steph Green was nominated for Outstanding Directing for a Limited Series, Movie, or Dramatic Special. =Ratings= In its original broadcast in the United States on HBO, the episode received 752,000 viewers, which was an increase from the previous week.

Early life  Jennie Van Name Hughes was from Ocean Grove, New Jersey, the daughter of George Hughes (1823-1904) and Abby Townley Van Name Hughes. Her father was an English-born Methodist minister and editor. Her older sister Eliza Ann Hughes Davis was also a missionary in China, her older sister Mary Ernsberger was a missionary in India, and her older brother George Mead Hughes was a Methodist minister.American Women Missionaries and Pioneers Collection, Microfilm Collections, University of Oregon Libraries. Her maternal aunt, Nettie Van Name, was an evangelical singer.  Career  Hughes went to China as a missionary in 1905, commissioned by the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church to teach in Jiujiang. Hughes was principal of the Knowles Bible Training School at Jiujiang. She worked with Shi Meiyu (Mary Stone), and the two traveled to the United States together in 1907 for Stone's health. Hughes was in the United States from 1910 to 1912, for the Woman's MIssionary Society's jubilee celebrations, touring with other American women missionaries to speak at events in different cities, including Pittsburgh Washington, D.C., and Oakland.American women missionaries speaking at jubilee celebrations in 1911.

In 1915 Hughes and Stone were injured in a car accident in La Jolla, California, and stayed in the United States into 1916 to recover. After another leave and lecture tour in the United States in 1919, the pair left the Methodist mission at Jiujiang in 1920, over a disagreement about doctrine. Hughes and Stone, along with Mary Stone's sister Phoebe Stone, began the non-denominational Bethel Mission in Shanghai in 1920. Bethel Mission included a chapel, a hospital, schools, an orphanage, a printing service, and housing for staff and students. Hughes wrote a book of short stories, Chinese Heart-Throbs (1920), with an introduction by Stone. In October 1920, the pair toured several Chinese cities, \\"combining lectures on health with evangelism\\", at schools and YMCA halls, and to nursing groups. In 1925, the Bethel Mission helped treat wounded soldiers during unrest in Shanghai. \\"All our remaining schoolgirls are sleeping here,\\" Hughes wrote in a report from the scene. \\"The teachers and a few boys will come here if firing begins, and we will hide in the cellar. We have wounded soldiers from both sides. One officer is very bad and will likely die tonight.\\"  Personal life  With increasing danger from war, Hughes and Stone moved their mission to Hong Kong in 1937, and left for America. In 1939 they moved to Pasadena, California with their three adopted daughters, Mary, Grace, and Norma, and two other girls, Loretta Soong and Eileen Chen Lin. Hughes died in California in 1951, aged 77 years. Some of her letters are in the Eliza Ann Hughes Davis papers at the University of Oregon Libraries. One historian describes Hughes and Stone's 45-year professional and personal partnership as \\"the most notable special friendship on the mission field.\\" Bethel Mission continues in the form of Bethel High School in Hong Kong.

Biography Born in Genoa, Novella worked in a shoe factory, then was apprenticed as a blacksmith in his father's workshop. He joined the Socialist Youth Federation in 1920, becoming active in the anti-fascist movement, and by 1923 was serving on the federation's national committee. However, in 1924, he led the whole of the Genoa federation into the Communist Party of Italy. In 1925, Novella undertook national service with the military, but he continued his political activities, and as a result spent time in military prison. He was discharged the following year, and became a leading supporter of Gramsci, serving on the central committee of the Italian Communist Youth Federation (FGCI). In November, he was sentenced to four years in prison in absentia, but he evaded capture until the middle of 1927. He was then imprisoned, being released in 1931 and exiled to France, where he became secretary of the FGCI. He undertook numerous missions for the group, also serving on the executive of the Communist Youth International, and studying at the Tolmačev School in Leningrad, and Sverdlov Communist University. Novella was arrested in 1942, but the Vichy regime was unaware of his true identity, and so he was soon released. In 1943, he managed to clandestinely re-enter Italy, and began organising an opposition group, from a base in Milan. From 1945, he served on the Italian Communist Party (PCd'I)'s central committee, and in 1946, he was elected to the assembly of the Province of Genoa. Novella worked as the PCd'I's regional secretary for Liguria, then Lombardy, then from 1948 was the principal organiser of the Italian General Confederation of Labour (CGIL). From 1955, he was the leader of the Federation of Metallurgical Workers, then in 1958, he was elected as general secretary of CGIL. CGIL grew under his leadership, and he was also appointed as president of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU). However, he became critical of some tactics of the WFTU, and was replaced as its president in 1961. In 1970, CGIL voted to separate its leadership from that of the PCd'I; Novella chose to retain his position on the central committee of the party, and resigned as the federation's secretary. He stood down in 1972, his health worsening, and was made the party's president of international relations.

The reservoir was planned during the 1930s, with much land being bought for its construction, but it was not completed until 1954. History A bill was presented before Parliament in October 1936 to enable the Huddersfield Coporation to build a reservoir at Digley, impounding Digley Brook. This was passed in July 1937 and required the purchase of several buildings, including two mills and a pub (the Isle of Skye Inn), though one of the mills was derelict. The reservoir did not open until 1954. Recreation The area is associated with the TV sitcom ‘Last Of The Summer Wine’, which was filmed in Holmfirth and the surrounding areas. The reservoir has a picnic area, two free car parks and there are also some benches around the lake that provide a quiet place of reflection. There are two main walking routes, the long walking route is and goes as far as Blackpool Bridge in Holmfirth. The shorter route is an easy circular Peak District walk around the reservoirs, which starts at the car park at the North Eastern end of the reservoir, off Gibriding Lane. It leads around to the North End of the reservoir on Kirklees Way, passing by Bilberry reservoir through to Digley Wood on the southern side of the water, before returning to the car park using Fieldhead Lane. The reservoir is also one of the waypoints on the Yorkshire Water Way. The reservoir is a source of water for Yorkshire and Yorkshire Water provide the free car parking plus walking route maps to follow. Their Digley, Bilberry and Beyond Walk is long and the Digley Walk is . The Peak District Boundary Walk runs along the west side of the reservoir.

It suffered from both aerodynamic and structural problems and did not reach production. Design and development The Snezhinka was a prototype single seat, standard class ( wingspan) sailplane with a largely traditional wooden structure but with PVC foam filler strengthening. Its high aspect ratio, mid-set, straight tapered wings had a laminar aerofoil and were built around a single, wide box spar. This formed the central part of the wing between 25% and 65% of the chord. Its leading and trailing edges, covered with plywood skin, were supported internally with PVC foam. The tips had end plates. Narrow-chord ailerons occupied about 45% of the trailing edges and there were also airbrakes. The MAI-60's wooden fuselage was ply-skinned over stringers supported by bulkheads. Its cockpit was ahead of and over the wing leading edge, with its pilot in a semi-reclined seat under a single-piece, jettisonable canopy which ran smoothly into the raised rear fuselage. Aft, the fuselage tapered from below to a 90° butterfly tail with tetragonal fixed and control surfaces. There were tanks for of water ballast. It landed on a central, semi-retractable monowheel aided by forward and tail skids. Testing over 1961-2 showed that the flight characteristics were poor, with directional instabilities and a need for large pitch inputs, and that its spin behaviour was unusual. There was also a structural problem caused by low strength glue, so the MAI-60 did not reach production.

It is one of several casinos located in the Quad Cities. History On April 21, 1995, the Lady Luck Bettendorf began operating after being granted an excursion gaming license earlier that year. It was not the first, nor the only riverboat casino at the time in the Quad Cities; the Diamond Lady began operating April 1, 1991 in Bettendorf, while The President sailed from Davenport, Iowa and Jumer's Casino was working out of Rock Island, Illinois. In March 2000, Lady Luck Gaming was acquired by Isle of Capri Casinos and the casino was re-branded to reflect the change in ownership. On June 24, 2016, the casino was moved from a riverboat to a land- based casino. The name, originally Isle of Capri Bettendorf, has since been shortened to Isle Casino Bettendorf. The casino boat Bettendorf Capri was sold to American Queen Steamboat Company to be converted into an overnight passenger vessel to join their fleet of river cruise ships. In 2017, Eldorado Resorts (later renamed as Caesars Entertainment) acquired Isle of Capri Casinos, including Isle Bettendorf. Property information The Isle Casino Bettendorf currently offers 35,000 square feet of gaming space and 514 hotel rooms. There are 935 slot and video poker machines, table games, and sports betting.

Among his published works are a biography of James Hargreaves, inventor of the spinning jenny, and The First Industrial Society: Social History of Lancashire, 1750–1850, a study of the social aspects of the industrial revolution. Aspin has had a lifelong interest in local history and the history of the Lancashire textile industry in particular.  Life and career  Aspin has spent his life in Helmshore, a small mill-town immediately south of Haslingden, Rossendale. In his 2003 memoir Just A Few Words: A Helmshore Boyhood he describes a friendly, polite, thrifty and hard-working community \\"...one half of the village being church and Tory, the other half chapel and Liberal\\". He writes warmly of his childhood memories, and how his family, friends and relatives were closely integrated into the discipline of the textile mills that provided most of the population with employment. Aspin attended Helmshore Council School and, after a period during the war when he was often seriously ill, he passed a scholarship examination and started at Haslingden Grammar School in 1944. At school his passion for cricket developed, and Haslingden Cricket Club's ground was just a short walk away. Here he was able to see the international professionals who played for the club as part of the Lancashire Cricket League, which gradually became an important part of his life. He has written on league cricket for Wisden for the past 40 years, and has acted as the Secretary of Haslingden Cricket Club for more than 40 years; he has a suite named after him at the club. After school Aspin undertook National Service in the RAF and, on completing this, he formed Helmshore Local History Society with his friend Derek Pilkington. In 1949 Aspin started work as a journalist, including the Lancashire Telegraph. Most of his working life was spent at the Manchester Evening News where he wrote on business, finance and music. He also acted as local correspondent for the Times, Guardian, and Daily Telegraph. He retired from journalism in 1993, but has continued to research and write books. During the 1960s, with Derek Pilkington and others, he helped with the transition of Higher Mill, Helmshore, into its role as Higher Mill Textile Museum.  Writings  Throughout his writing Aspin has returned over and over to the ways in which Haslingden and Helmshore have changed and developed over the last century. Both places grew enormously during the Industrial Revolution, and were famous for the production of woollen and cotton goods. Many of his books record the rise and fall of the mills, which once dominated the skyline; the move away from railways to motorways; and the overall changes of the last half century, in which time Haslingden and Helmshore have become large residential areas for people commuting to Manchester and other nearby towns. His The Water-Spinners, A New Look at the Early Cotton Trade, records his search for the sites of mills that used Sir Richard Arkwright's machines. The Golden Valley describes Rossendale's most important years. Aspin has also been concerned with the civic and spiritual life of the community, as well as with sports (especially cricket) and other pastimes. His second book was a history of Haslingden Cricket Club in the Victorian Era, which was reviewed by John Arlott in Wisden. Aspin also wrote the popular Shire Publications guides to both the woollen and the cotton industries. Aspin's research in the 1970s on poverty in working-class Salford, Manchester and elsewhere in Lancashire led to the journalist Stanley Graham's writings on cholera and sanitation in the slums. Aspin has contributed articles on cotton pioneers James Hargreaves, James Thomson and John Bullough, to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. At the age of 70 Aspin wrote, Just a Few Words: A Helmshore Boyhood, remembering 50 years of thoughts and feelings of living in Helmshore throughout the 30s and 40s. He has also authored, sometimes in partnership with another local historian, John Simpson, several books of historic photographs of the district. Since retiring Aspin has written over a thousand light verses, published by Royd Publications and Carnegie Scotforth. As well as his writings on local and textile history and heritage, Aspin has written a number of short books for children and young people. During his later years he has also has written booklets of ghosts and hauntings (typically taking place within Rossendale), and is a member of the Society for Psychical Research.

She is Senior Lecturer and Deputy Head of the Department of Archaeology at the University of York. She previously worked as Assistant Director of the British Institute in Eastern Africa (2005-2008) and remains a Trustee and Member of the BIEA Governing Council. In 2016, Wynne-Jones was elected to Fellowship of the Society of Antiquaries of London. Wynne-Jones is one of the Core Group at the Danish National Research Foundation Centre of Excellence in Urban Network Evolutions (Urbnet), Aarhus University. Between 2015 and 2017 she was a Pro Futura Scientia Fellow at the Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study, Uppsala.  Research  Wynne-Jones' research has explored the medieval history of eastern Africa, with a focus on the Swahili coast and the caravan trade that connected it with the African interior. She has directed a series of projects across east Africa, including at Kilwa Kisiwani in southern Tanzania, at Vumba Kuu on the Kenya coast, on Mafia Island, at Ujiji by Lake Tanganyika and on Zanzibar. Her 2016 monograph draws on these multiple research projects to develop the idea of a distinctive system of value and engagement with material culture to be found on the precolonial Swahili coast. She is joint editor with Adria LaViolette of The Swahili World. She is part of a network that have been exploring the Global Middle Ages and has co-written a response to Gordon Childe's seminal article What Happened in History? Her current research project examines the urban ecology of early settlement on Zanzibar. Wynne- Jones research also focuses on archaeological theory - exploring social complexity by challenging the idea unilineal social progress through archaeology. = Excavation = Wynne-Jones has directed excavations at multiple sites across eastern Africa. These include: * Songo Mnara, a stone town in Tanzania which is designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Her excavations at the site have applied multiple methodologies to exploring the uses of space across the 14th - 16th century Swahili town. Wynne-Jones has focused in particular on the domestic spaces and how they were inhabited and used as part of domestic activity and external trade. Together with Jeffrey Fleisher she has also published extensively on the site itself and the methodologies used to recover traces of daily life. * Vumba Kuu, a site on the southern coast of Kenya. Wynne-Jones' work here has explored the materiality of historical traditions at the site and how the histories rest on practices and priorities of life at Vumba. * At Unguja Ukuu, an archaeological site on the island of Zanzibar, Wynne-Jones has been exploring the layout of the site and experimenting with ways of recovering high-resolution chronologies of urban life. = Objects and materials = Wynne-Jones has a particular interest in objects and materials and has published extensively on the ways that people interacted with material culture in the African past. She has published on the role of money and the ways that coinage was part of a wider set of objects that held value through the ways people interacted with them. Together with Jeffrey Fleisher she has explored the ceramic dataset of the Early Tana tradition. With Jason Hawkes, she has explored the lapidary trade in the east African coast and suggested that connections with India began in the first millennium AD. = Co-production = Wynne-Jones was Principal Investigator for CONCH (Co-Production Networks for Community Heritage in Tanzania). This project explored the built environment of the Swahili coast to further understanding of the area's past, both locally and globally. She is lead on community production and material culture for Rising From the Depths, an AHRC-funded project exploring the potential for tourism through maritime heritage on the east African coast. She has advocated for greater depth in understanding of how coastal communities interact with sites and objects relating to their heritage.  Education  Wynne-Jones was awarded a PhD by the University of Cambridge in 2005, for a thesis exploring the settlement of the Kilwa region during the period of urbanisation at Kilwa Kisiwani. Her BA(Hons) in Archaeology was from the University of Bristol (1995-1998), followed by an M.Phil in African Archaeology at the University of Cambridge.

Its declared aims are \\"to bring together all concerned with early music and to forge links with other early music organisations in the UK and around the world\\". Francis Knights is Chairman and the management is in the hands of an elected Council. Several eminent musicians have chaired the Association in the past, including Christopher Page, Peter Holman (currently President) and the late Clifford Bartlett. Origins of NEMA and the Regional UK Fora A conference on 'The future of early music in Britain' was held on 14–16 May 1977 in the Waterloo Room of the Royal Festival Hall, London. The Arts Council and the Gulbenkian Foundation provided financial support, and the conference chair was Howard Mayer Brown. More than 180 delegates took part representing performers, scholars, instrument-makers, publishers, libraries, festivals, broadcasters, societies, retailers, journals, record companies, concert agencies, museums, archives and schools. Francis Knights wrote in his article on the conference: \\"Mayer Brown commented that 'there is a real need for a new body' to coordinate further activity; it was in fact as a result of this conference that the National Early Music Association (NEMA) was founded—its President was ... J. M. Thompson—and it was followed by the nine regional associations which flourish to this day\\". NEMA Membership Subscribing members receive Early Music Performer NEMA's journal, published twice a year by Ruxbury Publications on behalf of the Association. A Newsletter is also published biannually on its website; an early edition included an article on NEMA's history. NEMA's publications bring the most important new scholarship to practising early musicians, and keep its readers up to date with the latest news from the world of Historically Informed Performance [HIP]. Members also have access to various supplements, including new publications and past issues of Early Music Performer, Leading Notes, the Newsletter and the Early Music Yearbook. A complete index of all these publications was issued in 2019. The NEMA Early Music Database includes a Register section of individual performers, a Directory of information about societies, music publishers, providers of performing material, concert promoters and artists' agents, record companies, early music fairs, courses and summer schools, and a Buyers'Guide to some 600 makers of early musical instruments worldwide, giving details of instrument types offered for sale. Any musician can add their details to the Register without charge. Conferences An important part of NEMA's work is devoted to organising conferences, often in co-operation with an institutional partner. An early event was NEMA's conference From Renaissance to Baroque, held in July 1999 at the University College of Ripon and York St John, as part of the York Early Music Festival. A book on the conference From Renaissance to Baroque: Change in Instruments and Instrumental Music in the Seventeenth Century was published in 2005; a preface to the book reads: 'The essays in this volume are reworkings of papers presented at the National Early Music Association conference held, in association with the Department of Music, University of York and the York Early Music Festival, at the University of College of Ripon and York St John, in York on 2–4 July 1999.' The book was reviewed in the Performance Practice Review of 2007. In July 2009, NEMA held a conference Singing music from 1500 to 1900: style, technique, knowledge, assertion, experiment in conjunction with the University of York. A conference on Mechanical Musical Instruments and Historical Performance was held by NEMA and the Guildhall School of Music & Drama on 7–8 July 2013. A conference on Early Keyboard Instruments and Their Music was held on 2 September 2017. NEMA held a two day conference on Vocal Sound and style 1450-1650 in October 2018 in association with the Brighton Early Music Festival. NEMA is currently working on an important international conference Vocal Sound and Style 1650-1830 planned for Autumn 2021. Details of all previous conferences can be found on NEMA's website. Early Music Fora There are nine regionally-based Fora, all of which operate independently from each other and from NEMA. The aim of each Early Music Forum is to promote the playing and singing of early music (mainly pre-1750) and to promote historical awareness in doing so. Most publish a newsletter and run participatory workshops, and some run summer schools. See NEMA's website for map of UK showing their geographical areas. The history of a typical forum [Eastern Early Music Forum] is detailed in an article by Robert Johnson. The Fora were a formative influence on present members of the NEMA council, with Francis Knights attending the founding meeting of the Eastern Early Music Forum.

She is the sixth member of the General Presidential Council, the most authoritative body in the PKK.  Early life  She was born in 1978 in Taner in Tunceli Province, the seventh child of a family of nine children. She attended primary school in Tenar and attended secondary school in Kayseri. Bese Hozat said about her secondary and high school years in Kayseri that \\"I experienced the othering in Kayseri through Alevism and Dersimilik. When it is known that you are Kurdish and Alevi, there is an approach that marginalizes, scorns, and humiliates. Alevism, immortality, infidelity, God, religion, was reflected as something that is not the Qu'ran.\\" One of the ways in which Bese Hozat escaped this discrimination was being a part of radical left organization and many of these organizations were affiliated with Abdullah Öcalan. Bese Hozat's family was a victim of a 1938 massacre during the Dersim rebellion, and she said that they were \\"victims of a genocide.\\" She also said that \\"my grandfather was shot, my father's wife, his children were murdered. Many people from my family circle were massacred. My grandmother barely escaped the soldiers... this created a consciousness. In other words, there was a hatred and anger towards the state they created.\\" During her years in high school, she was influenced by Abdullah Ocalan, who published articles in the Ozgur Halk newspaper under the pen name 'Ali Firat.' In 1994, she joined the PKK in the mountains of Tunceli Province, taking the name Bese Hozat. the name of the wife of Seyid Riza, the leader of the Dersim rebellion.  Leadership in the PKK and feminism  Bese Hozat stayed in the Tunceli Countryside for around four years and was a part of many actions. Her sister was killed in 1997. Her father, Hasan Oran, was traumatized by the death of Bese Hozat's sister and decided to withdraw from Kandil. Throughout her time in the PKK, Bese Hozat served at management level, and has been affiliated with many women's organizations within the PKK. One of Bese's main objectives was to preside over arming and training women within the organization. She was outspoken about the need for more female representation in the PKK. At the Kongra-Gêl congress held from the 30 June to the 5 July 2013, Bese Hozat and Cemil Bayik, were elected as the co-chairs of the Executive Council of the Kurdistan Communities Union (KCK), replacing Murat Karayılan. The KCK is an umbrella organization that includes the PKK. Bese Hozat's election as the first woman in a leadership position in the KCK was seen as strengthening the women's movement within it. She says that the PKK is a woman's party and that Abdullah Öcalan had made PKK ideology so that it was against gender inequality. After the Kurdish Women's Movement's sixth General Assembly, they concluded that women need to be in leadership roles in democratic institutions and that for too long men have dominated leadership positions. She said that \\"There is a very violent struggle within us. An ideological war based on the equality of both sexes determines the main axis of our struggle. So as an organization, we believe that if a woman in a society is not free, that society is not free. If you say free society, then those two sexes will be free, those two sexes will be equal, recognize each others will, respect each other, love each other correctly. The model we developed in the organization is one such model.\\" The General Assembly also said that men in leadership roles were too individualistic and that women naturally are more social, communal, and democratic then men. Bese Hozat agreed with the General Assembly and went on to say that \\"education has an unquestionable role in the liberation of women for it helps people to become conscious which is a must for the attainment of free will and liberation from slavery. This is in direct contrast to what Hozat claims about the Turkish government. Hozat says that after the Justice and Development Party (AKP) asserted control after the failed 2016 coup attempt, the Turkish government has been increasingly dominated by males and religious fundamentalists.  Views on Iraqi Kurdistan and the nation-state  Hozat has been a very outspoken critic of the nation-state and supported the PKK abandoning its plan for an independent Kurdistan. When Bese Hozat was asked by the New Internationalist what she thought about the referendum on Kurdish independence in September 2017, she said that \\"our movement's approach is not about building a state - a state system will not be to the benefit of the Kurdish people but a thorn in the side.\\" She continues saying that \\"A Kurdish state will never be a solution to the Kurdish question. It would deepen the fight with our neighbors and bring decades of war against the Arab as well as chaos and suffering\\", and that \\"the era of nation-state is over. A state does not buy freedom because it's a bourgeoisie system that enforces repression on the people by an elite.\\" Bese Hozat also criticized Masoud Barzani, the leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) which called the referendum. She argues that the KDP are too centralized and that they were blackmailing the Kurdish population in South Kurdistan by telling them to support the independence referendum. Hozat claims that the referendum was called was because of the Iraqi Kurdish Parliament not having any power and that the people of Iraqi Kurdistan are facing grave economic and social problems. She thinks that Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Barzani are too close and that Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) needs the KDP's support for crushing the Kurdish population. Hozat further asserts that \\"Barzani represents the legacy of collaborative Kurds and Turkey, an occupying force.\\" Hozat has also expressed her distaste for borders that are affiliated with nation-states. In regards to the border of Turkey and Iran, Hozat says that Turkey's attempt to build a wall between Turkey and Iran signifies Turkey's current policies and that \\"the aspirations of the people for freedom cannot be contained by a wall.\\" Hozat wants the borders between the four parts of Kurdistan to be broken down so that the Kurdish people can truly be free from the nation-states. Hozat told the New Internationalist that \\"We're experiencing a third world war in the region\\" in regards to Turkey. After the failed Kurdish-Turkish peace process in the mid-2010s, the PKK resumed fighting in the region after an attempted coup against Erdoğan. Bese Hozat said that there never was a peace process and that ruling AKP was badly in need of a ceasefire due to a difficult situation both in local and foreign arenas. She accused the AKP of instrumentalizing the peace process to get more sympathy at home and abroad. Bese Hozat claimed that the PKK kept up their side of the peace process by withdrawing fighters from Turkey and releasing prisoners. When the conflict resumed in 2015, Bese Hozat said that the time had come for a \\"revolutionary public war.\\" She said that the AKP soon realized that the Kurdish movement was gaining strength in Rojava and that they were gaining international attention for their fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and the rescue of thousands of Yazidis after the Sinjar massacre. The AKP was further incentivized not to work with the Kurds after the Turkey's Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), a party which emphasises Kurdish rights, received 13% of the votes in the June 2015 general election.  Views of Europe and NATO  Hozat says that the EU are hypocrites. She says that the EU knows what Turkey is doing to the Kurdish people, but that they do nothing to intervene. Hozat sees the EU's stance with Turkey as pragmatic and that they are not doing enough for Kurds in southeast Turkey. Hozat claims that Turkey is \\"blackmailing Brussels by playing the 'refugee crisis card'\\" When Erdogan arrested 13 Kurdish oppositions members in Turkish parliament after a failed 2016 coup, Hozat says that Europe was silent on Erdogan's crackdown. She says that \\"Europe is responsible for the rise of fascism in Turkey because this silence and indifference are indirect support for Turkish policies.\\" Hozat has also been critical of NATO because of their backing of Turkey. Hozat claims that since the 1980s and 1990s Turkey's strategy for warfare against the Kurds has changed. Turkey is no longer using as many ground-troops and they are now using their Airforce and other sophisticated types weapons against alleged militants of the PKK. Hozat says that now the Kurds are experiencing the most intense kind of warfare from Turkey and that NATO is not speaking out. Hozat has accused NATO and Turkey of being responsible for the murder of Sakine Cansiz (Co-Founder of the PKK), Fidan Doğan (member of the Kurdistan National Congress), and Leyla Söylemez (member of the Kurdish youth movement) in Paris. Hozat says that the reason why no light has been shed on these murders is that NATO was involved and that Turkey has been using this incident to intimidate Kurdish women. When Bese Hozat discussed with the New Internationalist what she thought of United States and Russian relations with the Kurds, she said that \\"the interest of these two powers is rooted in their regional interests and their plans to redesign the region. They want to minimize the power of traditional region states which are too dogmatic in their positions - because they are an obstacle for global capital.\\" She says a big reason for why the Russians and the United States have started to support the Kurds is for fight against (Daesh) ISIS and Al Qaeda. Hozat also denies that weapons that the U.S. give to the People's Protection Units (YPG) are going to the PKK in Turkey. Hozat explains that the PKK has never had trouble getting weapons and that the Turkish government is attempting to smear the YPG. Bese Hozat has claimed that Al Qaeda and ISIS are \\"instruments created by the capitalist system.\\" Hozat blames the Baathists, the United States, Israel, and the UK of empowering radical fanatic Sunni Islamic groups in order to control the dominant Shia majority in the region after the fall of Saddam Hussein in Iraq. Hozat also blames Turkey, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia of allowing radical Sunni groups to flourish. Along with this, Hozat accused party members of the AKP with minimizing ISIS and that they are too busy trying to dismantle secularism in Turkey.  Views on Turkish referendum  When Recep Erdogan held a referendum in 2017 that proposed to change Turkey from a parliamentary system to an executive system, Bese Hozat condemned the Constitutional referendum as a power grab by Erdogan and the far-right Nationalist Movement Party (MHP). Bese Hozat said in an interview with Haaretz that changing Turkey to an executive system would embolden the far-right and nationalists in Turkey and incentivize them to do border-crossings in Iraq and Syria. Hozat says that Erdogan is promising stability and an end to terrorism at the cost of more authoritarianism. Bese Hozat sees the PKK as an influence both regionally and internationally. She says that Democratic Confederalism can be an alternative to the statist government systems.

She was a founder of VANGUARD, a magazine designed to give space to young, black South African women interested in how queer identities, pan-Africanism and Black Consciousness intersect. At the start of her career, Chigumadzi worked as a reporter for CNBC Africa. Chigumadzi draws on the history of Zimbabwe in her work, by exploring national and personal histories and identities. Her 2017 narrative essay These Bones Will Rise Again drew on Shona perspectives to explore the concept of the 'Mothers of the Nation' and interrogating perceptions of Nehanda Charwe Nyakasikana in Zimbabwe. While studying and writing the legacies of Zimbabwe's struggle for independence, Chigumadzi also writes about modern identities for southern Africans. She has written on the complexities of identity dismantling the notion of a colourblind, post-Apartheid South Africa, through a reclamation of the term \\"coconut\\". She is outspoken about the need for decolonisation at national and at personal levels. Her 2019 essay \\"Why I'm No Longer Talking to Nigerians About Race\\" discussed her experience at the Aké Arts and Book Festival on a panel discussing whether Black Lives Matter has relevance in Africa. Chigumadzi argued that, yes, in a continent with such different experiences of racialisation under colonialism, it did. In 2015, Chigumadzi was Programme Curator of the first Abantu Book Festival.

On 18 November it ruled that both the prohibition on the wearing of masks and related powers granted to the police to enforce it are inconsistent with the Hong Kong Bill of Rights, whilst leaving the question of relief to a future hearing. On 22 November the court declared the PFCR invalid and of no effect, but suspended the application of that declaration till 29 November 2019. The government appealed the decision on 25 November to the Court of Appeal, which partially allowed the government's appeal: the prohibition of masks at unauthorised assemblies was ruled to be constitutional, but not compulsion to remove them or the prohibition of masks at authorised assemblies.  Provisions of the PFCR  The regulation contains six sections. Section 1 provides for the citation of the PFCR, and section 2 some definitions. Section 3 prohibits the use of \\"any facial covering that is likely to prevent identification\\" at unlawful and unauthorised assemblies, and public meetings and processions as defined by the Public Order Ordinance (POO). In the POO, the terms “public meeting” and “public procession” have their plain meaning; an assembly is unauthorised under the POO where it is a public meeting or procession not granted permission by the Commissioner of Police, or any other public gathering in contravention of a direction made by the Commissioner in that connection or an order to disperse. Persons who contravene this prohibition are liable on conviction to a fine at level four (HK$25,000) and imprisonment of one year. Section 4 allows for two defences: first, in the case that a mask was worn with lawful authority, and, second, if worn with a reasonable excuse. Reasonable excuses envisaged include but are not limited to wearing masks for professional reasons, religious reasons, or pre-existing health reasons. Section 5 provides that a police officer may require a person to remove a face covering in order to identify them. If that person refuses, an offence is committed punishable with a fine at level 3 ($10,000) and imprisonment of 6 months; moreover the police officer may forcibly remove it, Section 6 requires that any prosecution for any offence created by the PFCR shall not commence more than 12 months after its occurrence.  Judicial review  The Court of First Instance (CFI) ruled that the granting of powers to the Chief Executive in Council on an occasion of public danger by the ERO was unconstitutional, and, therefore, that the entirety of the PFCR was unconstitutional because it was in exercise of those powers. On separate grounds it also declared all the substantive sections of the PFCR excepting that prohibiting the use of masks at an unlawful assembly inconsistent with the Basic Law and the Bill of Rights, and therefore of no effect. The Court of Appeal ruled that the ERO was in fact constitutional on occasions of public danger, and therefore that the PFCR was not invalid on those grounds. It additionally held that section 3(1)(b) of the PFCR, which prohibited masks at certain \\"unauthorised assemblies\\", is proportionate, and therefore valid, but upheld the decision of the CFI that the PFCR is invalid insofar as it prohibits masks at authorised assemblies and meetings.  Reactions  = Initial reaction = In response to the government's implementation of the law, a speech by Edward Leung in a televised debate during the 2016 Legco election was widely shared on the internet: “a few years ago, Ukraine passed an anti-mask law. Do you know what happened in Ukraine? A revolution started in Ukraine. You want to do it? Do it, we will fight till the end.” = Court of First Instance ruling = The central government immediately criticised the Court of First Instance's ruling, causing concern for the independence of Hong Kong’s judiciary. In response, the government said that it would stop enforcing the ban for the time being.Hong Kong’s High Court rules anti-mask law unconstitutional , HKFP, 18 Nov 2019People free to wear masks again: govt , RTHK, 18 Nov 2019Ban on masks must follow legal process , SCMP, 18 Nov 2019 A spokesman from the Chinese legislative affairs commission, however, stated that \\"Whether the laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region comply with the Basic Law of Hong Kong can only be judged and decided by the standing committee of the National People’s Congress\\". = Court of Appeal ruling = A commentary in the state-run China Daily said that the Court of Appeal's partial allowing of the government's appeal \\"strengthens the rule of law\\", though criticised it for allowing those at permitted assemblies to wear masks.

Its aim was to raise funds as well as solicit books donations so that American troops overseas during WWI could avail themselves of library services while serving the country. The council's headquarters existed in the Library of Congress starting in October 1917. Background On June 22, 1917, the American Library Association voted to create the War Service Committee and sub- committees. In August of the same year, a vote was held to green-light a fundraising campaign. The project's first campaign for funds ran from August 23, 1917 through November 1, 1917. During this time, Matthew S. Dudgeon was appointed Camp Libraries Director. One of the council's projects involved collecting books to send to American troops overseas during WWI. Another object was to provide overall library services to the troops. In total, the council held three campaigns to provide servicepersons with books and other amenities commonly found in libraries. Posters solicited the public for funds as well as book donations. Some campaigns solicited for money alone, while others were in solicitation of books. Various articles appeared in newspapers in magazines drawing attention to the cause and enlisting the public's interest in the education of soldiers. For example, Eveline W. Brainerd's \\"Reading At the Front,\\" published January 19, 1918 in The Independent, read: \\"Scant as the libraries at the front have been and still are, little as they hold of recent publications, they are yet circulating thousands of books and do fine service all of the daytime.\\" Chairmen The movement was headed by various chairmen such as Frank A. Vanderlip (1919), a banker, journalist, and former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, and Everett Perry (1917), Head Librarian of the Los Angeles Central Library, in charge of the Southwestern Division.

Nathaniel then moved to Connecticut to found Connecticut, but Richards instead moved to Dedham with his wife and brother-in-law. He signed the Dedham Covenant and was a member of First Church and Parish in Dedham. Though Dedham was intended to be a Utopian commune, and there was little disparity in wealth, Richards went by the title of \\"Gent\\" and, unlike others, aspired to a manor. He received large tracts of land, second only to the minister, John Allin. Before moving to Dedham, he purchased a large estate to use as his home and did not receive a house lot, as other settlers did. He then purchased and was distributed other tracts of land, one of which became known as Broad Oak. He died in May 1684. In his will, he left his home to his second son, Nathaniel, and not his oldest, John. It is suspected that this was because Nathaniel had given Richards more grandsons and thus would be in a better position to transmit the family name down through successively more prosperous generations.

The rivalry was born out of fierce on-ice competition between the two schools, especially in the 1990s and early 2000s, as the two schools were routinely at the top of the Hockey East standings and battled each other for conference supremacy. History In the early years of Maine's program, the rivalry was one-sided and had not yet truly formed, as Boston University dominated Maine on the ice, defeating them 13 consecutive times between 1982 and 1986, one of the worst losing streaks to a single opponent in Maine's history. Once legendary Black Bears coach Shawn Walsh took over the program, however, the tides started to turn, and Maine began to make up ground. One notable meeting between the teams occurred on February 19, 1993, at Alfond Arena in Orono, home of the Black Bears. Maine was in the midst of an unprecedentedly successful season, having entered that contest with a record of 30-0-2. Midway through the third period, Maine was leading by a score of 6-2, and it appeared they would cruise to another easy victory. However, the Terriers would rally, and manage to score four unanswered third period goals to tie the game at 6-6 and send it to overtime. In the overtime period, Terriers forward Mike Prendergast would get a breakaway from center ice and proceed to score the game-winning goal for the Terriers, giving them a stunning 7-6 victory and handing Maine their first loss of the season. Prendergast would say after the game, \\"My sister could have scored that goal\\" to taunt the Maine players and fans. However, this would end up as Maine's only loss the entire season, as they would not lose another game all season and win their first national title with a stunning 42-1-2 record, including defeating the Terriers twice more by a combined score of 11-3. Boston University would have their revenge, however, winning a national championship of their own in 1995, defeating Maine in the national title game 6-2. The on- ice rivalry between the schools was often overshadowed by the personal rivalry between the coaches, Walsh for Maine and BU's own legendary coach Jack Parker. Both men were impassioned and bombastic coaches, and as such drew the ire of each other and of opposing fans. While they often had choice words for each other during their coaching careers, Parker spoke kindly of Walsh during his cancer treatment and following his 2001 death. While some fans view Boston College and New Hampshire as BU and Maine's historical and primary rivals, respectively, fans from the heat of the rivalry in the 1990s and early 2000s may report that in their opinion, either Maine or BU is their schools true rival, not UNH or BC. Even after Walsh's 2001 death, the rivalry has remained heated and competitive, meeting in the Hockey East playoff tournament in 2002, 2004, 2009, 2010, and 2012, with Maine winning each matchup aside from 2009. The two teams also met in the NCAA National Tournament in 2002, with Maine emerging victorious. On January 24, 2004, the two teams combined for 268 penalty minutes in one game, a men's college hockey record that stands to this day, and stood as the all-levels, both genders record until 2013. The majority of the penalty minutes were accrued during a brawl at the end of the game, which was a 1-0 victory for Boston University. Even as Maine's team performance has declined in the latter part of the 2010s, games between the teams remain tense, chippy affairs, and simultaneous success for the teams would lead to a rejuvenation of the once-heated rivalry.

Bush and Jimmy Carter at the White House in September 1993 In 1993, Bush was targeted in an assassination plot when he visited Kuwait to commemorate the coalition's victory over Iraq in the Gulf War. Kuwaiti authorities arrested 17 people who were allegedly involved in using a car bomb in an attempt to kill Bush. Through interviews with the suspects and examinations of the bomb's circuitry and wiring, the FBI established that the plot had been directed by the Iraqi Intelligence Service. A Kuwaiti court later convicted all but one of the defendants. Two months later, Clinton retaliated when he ordered the firing of 23 cruise missiles at Iraqi Intelligence Service headquarters in Baghdad. The day before the strike, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine Albright went before the Security Council to present evidence of the Iraqi plot. After the missiles were fired, Vice President Al Gore said the attack \\"was intended to be a proportionate response at the place where this plot\\" to assassinate Bush \\"was hatched and implemented\\". In September 1993, Bush and other living former presidents were invited back to the White House for an Arab-Israeli peace accord. They also made the case to Clinton for a repeal of NAFTA. In April 1994, Bush attended the funeral of former president Richard Nixon.

After the results came in, the elder Bush told ABC, \\"I have very mixed emotions. Proud father, is the way I would sum it all up.\\" Jeb would again run for governor of Florida in 1998 and win at the same time that his brother George W. won re-election in Texas. It marked the second time in United States history that a pair of brothers served simultaneously as governors.

On September 28, 1994, Bush said he was opposed to sending American troops to Haiti, citing his loss of confidence in President of Haiti Jean-Bertrand Aristide while speaking to business and civic leaders in Houston. In an October 22, 1994 speech in Cancún, Mexico, Bush said history would vindicate him for not attempting to force Saddam Hussein out of power while in office: \\"The Mideast peace talks that offer hope to the world would never have started if we had done that. The Arabs would never have talked to us.\\" The unveiling of an official portrait of George H. W.

Through previous administrations, the elder Bush had ubiquitously been known as \\"George Bush\\" or \\"President Bush\\", but following his son's election the need to distinguish between them has made retronymic forms such as \\"George H. W. Bush\\" and \\"George Bush Sr.\\" and colloquialisms such as \\"Bush 41\\" and \\"Bush the Elder\\" became much more common. H.W. Bush was traveling to Minnesota for a speaking engagement on the day of the September 11 attacks. George W. made multiple calls to get in contact with his father before the two men reconnected after the elder Bush had gone to a Brookfield, Wisconsin motel. Bush told biographer Jon Meacham that his son's vice president, Dick Cheney, underwent a change following the September 11 attacks: \\"His seeming knuckling under to the real hard-charging guys who want to fight about everything, use force to get our way in the Middle East.\\" In December 2002, George W. sought counsel from the elder Bush regarding Iraq and informed him of \\"my efforts to rally the Saudis, Jordanians, Turks, and others in the Middle East\\".Meacham, pp. 571-572.

Jeb Bush's campaign struggled however, and he withdrew from the race during the primaries. Neither George H.W. nor George W. Bush endorsed the eventual Republican nominee, Donald Trump; all three Bushes emerged as frequent critics of Trump's policies and speaking style, while Trump frequently criticized George W. Bush's presidency. George H. W. Bush later said that he voted for the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, in the general election. After Trump won the election, Bush sent him a congratulatory message. Due to his hospitalization, both George and Barbara Bush were unable to attend the Inauguration of Donald Trump. Bush wrote a letter to Trump wishing him well, writing “I want you to know that I wish you the very best as you begin this incredible journey of leading our great country,” he continued. “If I can ever be of help, please let me know.” On February 5, 2017, George and Barbara Bush participated in the coin toss for Super Bowl LI.

That's where I want to go.\\" In October 2017, during the Me Too movement, actress Heather Lind accused Bush of groping her and telling an inappropriate joke. Several other women subsequently made similar allegations. Bush apologized for these incidents through his spokesman, Jim McGrath.

In December 2018, the nonprofit Compassion International, revealed that Bush secretly sponsored a boy in the Philippines for ten years using a pseudonym. He sponsored the boy from 2002 until 2012, personally writing to Timothy using the name George Walker. Timothy only found out who his sponsor had been after he graduated from the program at 17.

The half-hour show aired weekdays on NBC's local New York City affiliate station after The Today Show. The program was adapted by Walters from For Women Only, a talk show hosted by broadcast journalist and art critic Aline B. Saarinen. Gilda Radner studied tapes of Not for Women Only while creating Baba Wawa, her impression of Walters on Saturday Night Live. For Women Only Aline Saarinen, an art and architecture critic who became the third women correspondent for NBC News, was the original moderator of For Women Only. Each show featured a panel of intellectuals and academics who discussed topics considered to be women's issues, including birth control, abortion, and the generation gap. They also fielded questions from a small studio audience made up of topical experts who were invited to attend the taping.Audition, p. 190. Saarinen left the show in 1971 when she was named chief of NBC's Paris News Bureau. Transition After Saarinen left the show, NBC asked Barbara Walters if she was interested in taking over hosting duties. Walters accepted on the condition that the program's coverage was expanded and the show itself was renamed Not for Women Only. The first episode featuring Walters premiered in September 1971.Audition, p. 191. In addition to changing the name and widening the range of topics addressed on the show, Walters requested the studio audience be seated at round tables rather than in rows, creating a more engaging environment. Audience members were no longer invited experts but members of the public who wrote in for tickets, asking, as Walters put it, \\"questions the folks watching at home would most want asked.\\" The program was one of the first talk shows to involve audiences in this way. Madeline Amgott, one of the first women to produce TV news programming, produced episodes of the show. Hugh Downs sometimes appeared alongside Walters as a co-host. Topics Walters featured a variety of subjects on the show that she thought would be meaningful for her audience, including mainstream topics related to women's equality. These included \\"Sensitivity Training,\\" \\"Stress,\\" \\"Mastectomy,\\" and \\"Is the Family Dying?\\" along with \\"lighthearted themes\\" like \\"The Hostess with the Mostest.\\" The show also featured notable guests including Mamie Eisenhower, Barbara Bush, Lenore Romney, Martha Mitchell, Phyllis Cerf, and Mollie Parnis.Audition, p. 193. Whenever ratings slipped, Walters recalls, \\"we did a program that dealt with some aspect of sex ... We had the most dignified and respected experts address these issues, and our questions were also dignified, but we managed to be candid and therefore exciting in a way few shows were in those days.Audition, pp. 192-193. Reception and legacy By the time Not for Women Only had been on the air for six months, the ratings had tripled, and other NBC affiliates were picking up the show. The program was syndicated in 1972 and was soon broadcasting in eighty cities. The New York Times called it one of the most “provocative shows in the entire early morning schedule.” Walters cites the show as a forerunner of The View.Audition, p. 192. She left the program after signing on to co-host ABC Evening News with Harry Reasoner in 1976. In total, over 1,000 episodes of the show were aired.

The Citoyens and the Bourgeois formed the bourgeoisie and, thus the patrician class of the Republic.  Status  *The Citoyens (citizens) were offspring of bourgeois and born in the city. Only their males could reach the status of magistrate. *The Bourgeois were offspring of bourgeois or citizens who were born in a foreign country, or foreigners who had acquired the right of the bourgeoisie from the Magistrate. To gain access to the bourgeoisie, they had to buy it. In addition to the sum of money, it was customary to pay for a \\"seillot\\"Seillot: bucket to carry water during fires. The seillots were hanging on the walls near the fountains in the neighborhoods of the city. and often a firearm. The bourgeoisie acquired services for free or at a reduced price.Bulletin de la Société d'histoire et d'archéologie de Genève, Volume 6, 1933, p. 136Histoire du Collège de Genève, 1896, 402 pages, p. 96 The bourgeois could be on the General Council and the Council of Two Hundred. *The Habitants (inhabitants): foreigners who had permission from the Magistrate to live in the city. They had to pay a housing tax. The inhabitants could access the bourgeoisie after living a certain number of years in Geneva. *The Natifs (natives): sons of foreigners allowed to live there, born in the city. They were deprived of any political right and could not practice certain professions.  History  The assembly of the bourgeois and citizens of Geneva constituted the General Council. The number of bourgeois entitled to vote in the General Council never exceeded fifteen hundred. The General Council originally elected the Geneva Trustees, magistrates responsible for the administration of the commune, for a period of one year. Later, it appointed the Council of Two Hundred. Most citizens of Geneva came from neighboring Savoy because many of them worked and participated in the administration of the city of Geneva.Ville de Genève les 400 ans du traité de St-Julien. Revolts against nepotism and the influx of foreigners, particularly French Protestant refugees whom Calvin forced into the bourgeoisie to ensure his domination. He thus secured a majority in the elections of 1554. During the eighteenth century, Geneva was marked by many political troubles stemming from the inequality of rights between Genevois. The bourgeois, who enjoyed a privileged status, and their descendants, the citizens, held the upper hand: had all the political rights and many economic privileges. In front of them, the inhabitants and their descendants, the natives, form a population without political rights and hampered in its economic activities. Due to the French invasion of Switzerland, the bourgeoisie of Geneva lost their privilege in 1798. All Genevans have been ordinary citizens since that date. The capacity of Bourgeois, that is to say of citizen of a city having political rights not available to other residents, forms the base of the urban organization of cities. This urban system in Europe for many cities dates back to Greco-Latin antiquity,Henri Pirenne, Les villes du Moyen Âge, essai d’histoire économique et sociale, Bruxelles, Lamertin, 1927.

Monocentric centromeres are the most common structure on highly repetitive DNA in plants and animals.

The core of the project consisted of Petr Muk and Petr Kučera, with consistent support from Petr Hons, three musicians who were until 1993 also active in the popular Erasure-influenced band Oceán from České Budějovice. The trio was complemented by a number of rotating female vocalists including Jana Benetová, Jana Feriová, Jana Badurová, and later Jana Petrová, Linda Finková, Michaela Klímková, and Olina Mašková. Shalom released two studio albums and a number of hit singles before breaking up in 1994. History During the Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia, the band Oceán, thanks to their manager Jiří Vatka, had the opportunity to open for the English duo Erasure in Prague. Following this, the trio of Kučera, Muk, and Hons came up with a number of song ideas which didn't appeal to the rest of the band, so they decided to create a side project, which they called Shalom. The project dabbled strongly in Jewish themes and symbolism, something Muk had been toying with for a while. In 1992, the self-titled debut album was released. Singers Jana Benetová, Jana Feriová, and Jana Badurová were invited to join the project. The first music videos were recorded in Slovakia, and later in Israel. In 1992, Shalom were inspired to contribute to the album Give Me More ... Olympic, where thirteen bands paid tribute to legendary Czechoslovak rock band Olympic by choosing one of their songs each, which they edited and recorded in their own style. Shalom recorded the track \\"Pohřeb své vlastní duše\\", and a year later they released the single \\"Olympictures\\". In 1994, the band released the single \\"Someday\\", which was filmed in London. This song was not included on the sophomore album, however. Vocalists who had worked with Oceán, among them Linda Finková and Michaela Klímková (Petr Muk's wife), participated in the second Shalom album, titled Brány vzkazů, which was released in 1994. This record proved less commercially successful than the previous one, and the group split up shortly after. Petr Muk continued being active in the music scene, with a number of successful solo albums, numerous roles in operas and musicals, until his unexpected death in 2010. Petr Kučera also released a number of solo albums following the demise of his two most successful bands, and in 2011 he returned with a new incarnation of Oceán, which also includes Petr Hons.

Life  =Business= Johann Heinrich Richartz took over his father's business in the leather and wild hide trade after completing an apprenticeship in Mainz, Brussels, and Antwerp. He expanded business relations with North and South America to the point that the Cologne branch of J.H. Richartz & Co. was in competition with the main trade offices in Antwerp. Richartz retired in 1851 as a \\"simple, sober and unpretentious\\" citizen. =Museum patronage= At a meeting of the City Council of Cologne on May 3, 1854, it became known that Richartz offered \\"to pay the construction costs of a new municipal museum at the beginning of next year to the city treasury the sum of one hundred thousand thalers (German Silver Coin) against one deposit the annual pension of four out of a hundred.\\" The aim of the foundation was to include the art collection of the collector Ferdinand Franz Wallraf, which he had left to the city in 1824, in the completed municipal museum. Further endowments followed, making the final total of his donations 277,000 thaler, more than half the museum's total construction costs. In recognition, Frederick William IV of Prussia made him a royal Kommerzienrat and a member of the Order of the Red Eagle 3rd class, and in June 1857 the Universal Society for the Encouragement of Arts and Industry awarded him a gold medal. He was also made an honorary member of the Academy of Arts. Richartz died in Cologne after a brief illness shortly before the building's completion. The building was named after Richartz's and Wallraf at its opening in 1861. His will left another 100,000 thaler to fund a lunatic asylum on the condition that the interest for the next ten years was used as an acquisition fund for the new museum. He also left 9,000 thaler to expand the Minoritenkirche next door to the museum, 2,500 thaler to Cologne Cathedral, and 2,000 thaler to fund a charity place at the Rheinischen Musikschule. Like Wallraf, he was buried in the Melaten-Friedhof. On 10 April 1900, a bronze statue of Richartz by Wilhelm Albermann was unveiled outside the Wallraf-Richartz-Museum's original site (now the Museum for Applied Arts). That site was on a street between Wallraf-Platz and Minoritenstrasse, now known as the Richartzstraße. Richartz's home on the Blaubach is marked by a bronze memorial tablet.  Awards and Honors  In 1860, Richartz was appointed Honorary Member of the Royal Academy of Arts in Berlin.

Distribution Oxycarenus laetus is found in Iraq, Pakistan, India, Myanmar, Malaysia, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos. In India and Pakistan it displaces Oxycarenus hyalinipennis on cotton; this species, commonly known as the cotton seed bug, occupies a similar niche in other cotton-growing regions of the world, with the exception of North America.Samy, O. 1969. A revision of the African species of Oxycarenus (Hemiptera: Lygaeidae). Transactions of the Royal Entomological Society of London 121(4): 79 – 165. link Hosts Oxycarenus laetus is a polyphagous insect, feeding on the seeds of a number of plants in the Malvaceae family. As well as being a pest of cotton (Gossypium spp.) crops, this insect is found on Abutilon indicum (Indian mallow), Sida acuta (common wireweed) and Thespesia populnea (portia tree). On these plants, populations are at their highest during the hotter months from March to July, and at their lowest between November and January. The insects seem to do best when the temperature is high and the humidity moderate. Other host plants on which this bug can be found include Hibiscus sabdariffa (roselle), Hibiscus vitifolius (tropical rose mallow) and Hibiscus esculentus (okra). Besides these plants on which the dusky cotton bug breeds, it feeds on a number of other plants and weeds including Deccan hemp, Dombeya burgessiae, Grewia asiatica, Melochia corchorifolia, Malva pusilla, Malva spp., Malvastrum spp. and Malvascus spp. Life cycle The female Oxycarenus laetus lays a batch of cigar-shaped eggs between the lint and the calyx in half-open cotton bolls. The eggs hatch in between six and ten days, and the young develop through six nymphal stages before becoming fully grown in thirty to forty days. Ecology Both adults and nymphs of Oxycarenus laetus feed on the developing seeds of the cotton plant. The seeds fail to develop properly and the lint gets stained.

They are found naturally in tobacco leaves.  Research  Research on nicotine salts is limited. Possible health risks of persistent inhalation of high levels of nicotine salts are not known. \\"Juul products use nicotine salts, which can lead to much more available nicotine,\\" Principal Deputy Director Dr. Anne Schuchat of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated in September 2019. She also stated that the nicotine salts \\"cross the blood brain barrier and lead to potentially more effect on the developing brain in adolescents.\\"  Types  A nicotine base and a weak acid such as benzoic acid or levulinic acid is used to form a nicotine salt. Benzoic acid is the most used acid to create a nicotine salt. Nicotine pyruvate is another form of nicotine salt. A chemical reaction with a pyruvic acid is used to aerosolize nicotine.  Level and rate of delivery  A free-base nicotine solution with an acid reduces the pH, which makes it possible to provide higher levels of nicotine without irritating the throat. Nicotine salts are thought to amplify the level and rate of nicotine delivery to the user. The speed of nicotine salts uptake into the body with the use of electronic cigarettes is close to the speed of nicotine uptake from traditional cigarettes. Traditional cigarettes provide high levels of nicotine, but with the bad taste of smoking. Pod mods, however, can provide high levels of nicotine without the negative smoking experience. Nicotine salts are less harsh and less bitter, and as a consequence e-liquids that contain nicotine salts are more tolerable even with high nicotine concentrations. Nicotine salts in aerosol form do not generate the sensation of irritation in the chest and lungs that regular cigarettes do. Protonated nicotine salt is easier for less experienced users to inhale.  Brands  The latest generation of e-cigarettes, \\"pod products,\\" such as Juul, have the highest nicotine content (59 mg/mL), in protonated salt, rather than the free-base nicotine form found in earlier generations. In June 2015, Juul introduced a pod mod device containing nicotine salt. British American Tobacco stated that they have been using nicotine salts in their US Vuse e-liquid brand since 2012. There has been a proliferation of pod-based products with high nicotine concentration, triggered by Juul's financial success. As of September 2018, there were no less than 39 similar Juul devices as well as 15 Juul-compatible pods being offered. Tested show that the pod mods Juul, Bo, Phix, and Suorin contain nicotine salts in a solution with propylene glycol and glycerin.

Throckmorton entered his redshirt senior season on the watchlist for the Outland Trophy and was named a preseason All-American by the Associated Press and PFF. He was also named the fifth-best offensive line prospect for the 2020 NFL Draft by USA Today. Throckmorton was named honorable mention All-Pac-12 and a third team All- American by the Associated Press, as well as a second team Academic All- American, at the end of the season. Professional career Throckmorton signed with the New Orleans Saints as an undrafted free agent on April 27, 2020, shortly after the conclusion of the 2020 NFL Draft. He was waived on September 5, 2020 and signed to the practice squad the next day.

Despite having only an elementary education and no formal medical background, the treatment he devised had an extremely high success rate, resulting in the immunisation of approximately 3,000 people and the saving of many lives, which had a significant effect on the demographics of the Shetland population at the time. He is reputed not to have lost a single patient. While Notions administered his inoculation by at least the late 1780s to early 1790s (and likely much earlier), his method was largely overshadowed by the work of Edward Jenner, who pioneered the cowpox-based smallpox vaccine in 1796. Despite this, Notions and his inoculation were held with high regard with Shetlanders at the time, while the same could not be said for the cowpox-based vaccination introduced to Shetland in subsequent years.  Early life  John Williamson was born the son of Andrew Williamson; his mother's name is unknown. It has been suggested that the practice of naming John by his father's own surname, not adopting the patronymics system that was prevalent in Shetland at that time, indicates that his immediate family could be considered progressive and modern for the time. John Williamson's birth year is not known with any certainty – while his tombstone states he was born in 1740, some have suggested he was born as early as 1730. His place of birth is also not certain, but is thought to be Hamnavoe, Eshaness, in which the Williamson family lived from at least the late 1740s and possibly much earlier.  Smallpox inoculation  = Background = Shetland, being a relatively isolated community, was susceptible to outbreaks of smallpox throughout the 18th century that would spread through large proportions of the population due to a lack of immunity to the disease. In 1700, an outbreak of smallpox arrived in Shetland when the son of a local man had visited mainland Britain, where he had contracted the disease and spread it upon his return to Shetland. An estimated one-third of Shetland's population died as the result of this epidemic. The disease was subsequently referred to as \\"mortal pox\\", while the 1700 outbreak was used by those born around this time as a reference to calculate their age. Some of the smaller islands of Shetland were particularly hard hit – Fair Isle had previously had between ten and twelve families, but is said to have lost two thirds of its population in the 1700 outbreak, leaving too few to effectively manage their fishing boats; in Fetlar smallpox killed over 90 islanders of whom \\"most were married people\\". Smallpox would continue to strike Shetland every 20 years, with epidemics occurring in 1700, 1720, 1740 and 1760. The 1720 epidemic hit Foula particularly hard, where it is said \\"there were scarcely people left to bury the dead\\", whereas in Fetlar a certain amount of resistance is thought to have built up, as most of the 80 who died were under the age of 20. The 1740 epidemic required the extension of the Lerwick cemetery by , while in Fetlar a further 120 people died – this was exacerbated by a hard frost lasting over a month that prevented the dead from being buried. Approximately one-third of Unst's population was killed by smallpox. It is likely that Notions himself caught smallpox as a child of about ten during this epidemic. = Technique = Notions would first collect \\"matter\\" – i.e., smallpox pus. He would then dry it using peat smoke (which was believed to lessen the virus's virulence), and bury it in the ground with camphor (which has anti-bacterial properties, preventing the matter from decomposing). Oral history indicates the matter was spread between glass sheets before burial. It would be kept in this state for up to 7 or 8 years to reduce its virulence before being administered to a patient. By using a knife (which Notions made himself) he would cut into the patient's arm intradermally (without drawing blood), insert a small amount of the inoculant, and immediately cover the incision with the patient's skin, before using a cabbage leaf as a plaster. In contrast to contemporaneous quack doctors, Notions would not stipulate any particular resting conditions (such as \\"hot-treatment\\" – heating the ill patient in front of a fire, covering them with blankets and allowing them no fresh-air), nor would he administer any other medicines during the period of infection and recovery. Notions' inoculation bears a strong similarity to the Suttonian method, which also involved the introduction of weakened smallpox matter into the patient through intradermal means. How Notions became aware of this method of inoculation is unclear – it may have been through written account, or through discussion with someone else aware of the technique, such as another physician or a member of the clergy. = Results = It is not known whether the success of the inoculation technique used by Notions was due to its ability to decrease the virulence of the smallpox matter, or to the shallow intradermal insertion of the inoculant. The technique was highly successful and it and Notions were highly esteemed in Shetland. Notions was revered in contemporary accounts for the work he did. Reverend Andrew Dishington, the parish minister for Mid and South Yell, attested to the success of Notions' treatment: > Unassisted by education, and unfettered by the rules of art, he stands > unrivalled in this business. Several thousands have been inoculated by him, > and he has not lost a single patient. ...It is particularly remarkable, that > there is not a single instance in his practice, where the infection has not > taken place, and made its appearance at the usual time. In Arthur Edmondston's account, he commented that Notions' work: > ...met with such unexampled success in his practice, that were I not able to > bear testimony to its truth, I should myself be disposed to be sceptical on > the subject. ...Had every practitioner been as uniformly successful in the > disease as he was, the small-pox might have been banished from the face of > the earth, without injuring the system, or leaving any doubt as to the fact. Oral history recounts that Notions was able to save 16 of the 24 remaining inhabitants of Foula after an epidemic of smallpox struck there, and that he was \\"greatly honoured\\" for having saved their lives. It is not clear how many patients of Notions may have contracted secondary infections following inoculation. Also, it is possible that Notions' treatment may have caused some patients such as Lowrie Tulloch of Burravoe, Yell, or James Park of Fetlar to have been blinded. Notions is believed to have saved many more lives than he caused harm to.  Other occupations  Notions was considered someone who could apply his manual skills to many different trades and crafts. He was described during his lifetime as \\"a singular instance of an uncommon variety of talents, being a tailor, a joiner, a clock and watch-mender, a blacksmith, and a physician\\". He was additionally attributed with being (at various periods throughout his life) a farmer, fisherman, and weaver. Archivist Brian Smith at the Shetland Museum and Archives recounts how he is said to have been assigned the nickname \\"Notions\\", which he was called by his contemporaries: > ...[the name \\"Notions\\"] was bestowed on him by a member of the Gifford > family. According to this story, Williamson was at Gifford's house, > presumably on business, and the landlord asked him to rid his house of > 'checks', small noisy wood-boring beetles. Williamson looked behind the > clock and cleared away a mass of creepy crawlies. 'You hear no more checks > now,' he said. Gifford replied, fatuously, 'What a notions!' Notions is also said to have constructed a complex functional miniature watermill, which was based on a mill which he had only viewed a single time. It was capable of performing the same function of bleaching as the original mill through the power of a hand-turned crank. The only known remaining work of Notions is a wig stretching block that was made for James Cheyne, 7th Laird of Tangwick (the great-grandfather of Sir William Watson Cheyne), who was the laird of the area around Eshaness. The block is said to have been made in the image of a man from Hillswick who contracted smallpox and was treated by Notions. It is made from a worm-eaten piece of wood, the holes of which were filled with smaller pieces of wood to portray the smallpox scars on the man's face. The wig block is now kept in the Shetland Museum.  Johnnie Notions' Böd  An outbuilding near to the site of Johnnie Notions' house in Hamnavoe, Eshaness is () offered as a \\"camping böd\\" (böd being the Shetland dialect word for a fisherman's lodgings or store) which is rented out by the Shetland Amenity Trust as basic accommodation with limited facilities in the style of a camping barn. Johnnie Notions' Böd does not have an electricity supply, for example. The böd is open from 1 April to 31 October. Notions' original house and its outbuildings were designated as a Category C listed building in 1978.

The oculometer computes eye movement by tracking corneal reflection relative to the center of the pupil.An oculometer, which can provide continuous measurements in real time, can be a research tool to understand gaze as well as cognitive function. Further, it can be applied for hands-free control. It has applications in flight training, cognitive assessment, disease diagnosis, and treatment. The oculometer relies on the principle that when a collimated light beam is incident on the eye, the direction in which the eye moves is proportional to the position of the reflection of that light beam from the cornea with respect to the center of the pupil. Eye movements can be accurately measured over a linear range of more than 20^\\\\circ with a resolution of 0.1^\\\\circ.  History  Eye movement and tracking have been studied for centuries, with the very first eye tracking being simple observation of the eyes, by either oneself or another. The first improvement on this occurred in 1738, when an observer would feel the outside of closed eyelids to track eye movement. Next in 1879, an innovation to listen to muscle movements using a kymograph was implemented. Though rudimentary, these early techniques show repeated need throughout history to track eye movements. The first true eye tracking device was invented by Huey in 1898. To work, this device was required to contact the cornea, which limited its comfort, usability, and generalizability. It was not until the 20th century that a robust, non-contact, modern eye-tracker came to fruition. This device, called the photocornograph, worked by photographing eye movement based on reflection from the cornea. This device only recorded horizontal movements, until the work of Judd and colleagues in 1905 added both temporal and vertical recording. Due to the many applications of an eye tracking device to aviators and pilots, NASA and the United States Air Force carried out extensive studies on this technology, propelling the field forward. Much of this took place during the 1970s and 1980s. However even with this extensive research, oculometers remained bulky and technically difficult. Research-grade oculometers finally received a user-friendly redesign, with commercial devices available as of recently. These low-profile devices can be worn non- intrusively on a pair of eyeglasses.  Advantages  Since the principles governing the workings of the oculometer rely on a relatively simple concept (electro-optical sensing of the eye), it ensures that the oculometer will be functional whenever the user is seeing. Additionally, the position of the reflection of the collimated beam from the cornea can be approximated to be on the plane of the pupil. This implies minimal parallax error between the corneal reflection and the center of the pupil, thus making the oculometer insensitive to changes in the head position during measurements. These properties of the oculometer ensures minimal interference with the routine activities of the user during measurements. It also negates the need for extensive equipment like bite plates or rigid skull clamping for measurements.  Optical components  *Light source: Source of illumination such as cathode ray tube or glow modulator tube *Filter: light is filtered such that light incident on the eye is near infrared *Polarizer: light from the source is polarized to capture only true corneal reflections *Eyepiece: the user looks through an objective lens in an eyepiece, through which the illumination beam travels to irradiate the eye *Lenses: two collimating lenses *Beam splitters: one beam splitter directs visible light to the eye, the other directs light to the detector *Detector: a silicon diode camera records measurements A schematic of the oculometer, depicting the arrangement of the light source, objective lens, beam splitter, two polarizing lenses, detector, and eyepiece.  General principles  Eye movement can be quantified by reflection off the cornea. However, in this case a movement of the head would also cause a movement to be recorded. This can be overcome by either rigidly fixing the head to prevent any movements, however this is intrusive and uncomfortable for the user and not broadly applicable for human research studies. Or, the entire apparatus could be mounted on the head, which likewise is bulky and uncomfortable. A better solution is to measure two parameters, such as corneal reflection and pupil movement (based on pupil center). = Optical design = The optical design of the oculometer allows normal vision, directs light from a fixed internal source onto the eye of the user, and forms the image of the pupil on a detector. The basic lens design includes a fixed eye piece and an adjustable objective lens followed by 2 beam splitters. The device also consists of a polarization system to polarize the light from the source (typically a glow modulator tube) in the H direction. In order to attenuate the light from the source through reflections in the eyepiece, a linear polarizer in the V direction is placed in the optical path. A quarter wave plate is placed between the eye and the eye piece and rotates the plane of polarization by 90 degrees thus ensuring that the V-polarizer does not attenuate the true corneal reflections. The light source and detector are aligned coaxially. When the eye moves, the reflection off the cornea is displaced from the pupil center. This displacement is measured by D=\\\\kappa*sin \\\\theta D is displacement, \\\\kappa is the distance from the center of the cornea, \\\\theta is the angle of inclination of the eye’s optical axis to the oculometer. Near infrared light (NIR) (approximately 750nm to 2,500nm wavelengths) is used for a few reasons. First, NIR light is less detectable to the human eye than other wavelengths of visible light, so the NIR light beam is less intrusive or noticeable to the user. Second, with this configuration the pupil is backlit, resulting in a bright disc, effectively differentiating the pupil from the rest of the eye and face. Typically, the oculometer consists of an eyepiece through which the user sees. An alternate design exists where the oculometer is head-mounted. This arrangement does not include the traditional eye-piece and user sees through a transparent, curved visor placed in front of his eyes. = Electronic design = The traditional oculometer operates in two modes: acquisition and tracking modes. When the user first sees through the eye piece, a rough raster scan captures the black pupil and bright reflections from the cornea. Then, the device automatically switches to tracking mode where time-division-multiplex-scans acquires continuous measurements of eye direction. Eye direction from the time- division-multiplex scans are computed by the superposition of the scan positions of corneal reflection and pupil positions. In case of device malfunction or loss in continuity due to the user blinking their eyes, the device switches back to the acquisition mode until tracking is restored. In recent designs, the acquisition mode has been automated to ensure that the pupil/iris boundary was instantly captures once the user sees through the eye piece. The automation also led to automatic switch to tracking mode after initial acquisition was obtained or after the user blinks.  Applications  = Piloting aircraft = There are numerous uses for the oculometer in the field of aviation. One is understanding whether cognitive abilities are sufficient for flight clearance. Further, flight programs can use the oculometer to inform cockpit design in terms of instrumentation panels, by studying the gaze of pilots as they fly. Finally, aviator training has benefitted from the oculometer as well. Understanding how a particular pilot scans through his field of view while flying allows for personalized feedback from flight coaches. It can provide instructors with more information by which to evaluate and further instruct learning pilots. For this reason, NASA and the US Armed Forces have utilized oculometers in their training programs, creating the Oculometer Training Tape Technique in the late 1900s. = NASA = A NASA research project regarding the oculometer was to realize the ability for a person to control a machine using their eyes, which firstly necessitates eye movement measurements. NASA engineered a telescopic oculometer in which a user looks through an eyepiece, and given that the user can see through the eyepiece, eye movements will be measured. One particular application of NASA’s oculometer endeavor is eye control of an Astronaut Maneuvering Unit (AMU). When an astronaut is in space and would like to move, the AMU facilitates this. However, controlling such a unit is no trivial task. Manual/hand controls are difficult as there are many axes and therefore many muscle outputs needed to coordinate 3D movement. However, eye control would be easier to implement with an oculometer. = Cognitive assessment = Aviation requires robust, sharp cognitive function, and the eye is part of the central nervous system as they are extensions of the brain, linking cognitive function with healthy eye function. Therefore oculometers can function as cognitive assessment tools. =Diagnosis of Parkinson's disease= Abnormal eye movements is an established biomarker for numerous motor diseases including Parkinson’s disease. Each motor disease is expected to produce different signature pattern of eye movement abnormalities. Using those eye movement patterns both as a diagnostic tool and for monitoring disease progression has therefore been of scientific interest. Oculometers are therefore used in this area for tracking eye movement. The use of oculometers for diagnosis of motor diseases is promising, though it has not yet been validated in the clinic. For Parkinson’s disease specifically, the signature pattern of eye movement abnormalities occur as horizontal saccades (rapid, conjugate, eye movement that shift the center of the vision field). Patients with Parkinson’s disease displayed high inabilities in performing antisaccadic tasks (eye movement in the opposite direction from the onset trigger). Measurement of antisaccades therefore enables scientists to detect early stages of Parkinson’s disease. These studies are still in the research phase. = Smart eyeglasses = For this application, the electronic design of the traditional oculometer has been modified to replace complex real-time video processing such that the oculometer could fit on light weight eyeglasses and have relatively long battery life. Smart eyeglasses are used to correct for vision errors due to age-related conditions while restoring normal vision. Smart eyeglasses utilize tunable eyepieces compared to fixed lenses used in conventional glasses. These glasses work by projecting light from a few different directions using infrared LEDs on the user’s eyeball and receives the refracted light from discrete infrared proximity sensors also placed at a few different locations. The use of multiple detectors not only enables oculometers to be used as lightweight wearables but also ensures that signals detected by the sensors are not dependent on external illumination. This property allows the device to be functional in dark conditions. The major disadvantage of the use of sensors compared to continuous video processing is the significant decline in accuracy since measurements are both reduced in frequency and number of measurements.  Other applications  Other potential application of oculometers that are still currently under development include in air traffic control for operators to designate aircraft through eye movement; in laser communication in dynamic situations where operators can transmit signals by looking at the signal; in television systems to monitor the eye direction as it views the television display such that sensory requirements of the eye can be met with lower bandwidths; and in psychological tests to analyze pattern of images that patients tend to avoid.

Parts of the original priory are incorporated in the existing building, which has been a Grade I listed building on the Register of Historic England since 1951. History View of Hitchin Priory in 1795 In 1317 Edward II granted to the Carmelite Friars a messuage in the parish of Hitchin where they could build a church and house for their habitation. Other messuages and lands were given to them by John de Cobham. The Carmelites built a small convent there which was dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary. In September 1530 Henry VIII gave the friars at Hitchin a gift of 40 shillings. In May 1534 the Prior John Butler took the Oath of Supremacy and on 17 October 1538 he and four friars surrendered to Sir William Coffyn and Henry Crowche, the King’s Commissioners.Hitchin Priory before the Radcliffes 1317-1553 - Herts Memories: Gateway to Hertfordshire's community archive network The monks remained until the dissolution of their house in 1539. Thomas Parrys, acting as bailiff for the Crown, sold the plate and ornaments while the bells, lead, glass, tile and stone were stripped and the steeple knocked down – the desecrated site becoming a quarry for the local townspeople. In 1546 a survey was made of the priory and its whole estate. At that time the buildings of the priory consisted of a mansion house with a frater (refectory) and dorter (dormitory) over the cloister, a church, the 'old hall,' the Prior's lodging, and two little chambers for the brothers in addition to a kitchen, barn and other premises. There were also other tenements belonging to it in Bridge Street and Bull Street in Hitchin, which were leased out with the convent garden. With the exception of the mansion house, which had been kept in a good state of repair following the Dissolution, the remaining buildings were in a poor condition: 'all the buildings were sore decayed and very ruinous both in timber and tile for lack of reparations' with the former priory gardens 'like yards or waste places of ground'. The priory church was similarly in a poor state 'with the steeple broken down and decayed by the weather and all the lead, freestone, glass and bells gone.''Hitchin: Priory church and charities', in A History of the County of Hertford: Volume 3, ed.

From Watson and Herdson Hitchin Priory subsequently passed to Edward Pulter, who in turn sold it in 1582 to Ralph Radcliffe (died 1559).'Hitchin: Introduction and manors', A History of the County of Hertford: volume 3 (1912), pp. 3-12. URL: http://www.british- history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=43569 He on his death bequeathed his estates to his oldest son, also named Ralph. Over the next three centuries the Priory passed to various members of the Radcliffe family until it came into the possession of Hubert Delmé-Radcliffe, J.P., on whose death in 1878 it passed to his brother Francis Augustus Delmé-Radcliffe. The various branches of the Delmé-Radcliffe Family owned Hitchin Priory from 1582 to 1964. Front entrance to Hitchin Priory in 2016 Hitchin Priory as it now stands incorporates a small part of the original priory of the Carmelites. This original structure would appear to have been constructed of flint rubble and clunch with the now lost priory church located to the south. However, nothing earlier than the 15th century is visible and these ancient remains are located in sections of the north, or frater, range of the west range. The present structure was almost entirely built in 1770–1 by the politician and MP John Radcliffe who inherited Hitchin Priory from his uncle Arthur Radcliffe in 1769.RADCLIFFE, John (1738-83), of Hitchin Priory, Herts. Published in The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1754-1790, ed. L. Namier, J. Brooke., 1964 He rebuilt the house in 1770-71 of plastered brick, standing about the four sides of a courtyard, which represents the old, small, cloister garth. The walls of the courtyard have been considerably renewed over the years but in the north and west wings are many blocked arches of the original cloister arcade. The ground storey displays a shield of the Radcliffe arms is together with the initials R R S and the date 1679. This has an arcade of five semicircular arches with the one remaining open arch being the main entrance to the building. The north elevation is of the late 18th century and is in an elaborate Palladian design; the south wing was completely rebuilt at around this time and contains the main rooms. The east wing has some early 17th-century panelling while in a small north room is a plaster ceiling dating to the same period with cable and foliate decoration.

Upon earning her Bachelor of Arts degree in Social Psychology from Wilfrid Laurier University, she enrolled at Laurentian University for her Master's degree and Nipissing University for her Bachelor of Education. Her doctoral degree was earned at the University of Toronto. Career After earning her PhD, Tilleczek joined the faculty at Laurentian University as an Associate professor. She was eventually offered a position with the University of Prince Edward Island (UPEI) in 2009 as a Canada Research Chair in Child/Youth Cultures and Transitions. While at UPEI, she continued her research with the Ontario Ministry of Education to study how children, families and teachers deal with and support the transitions from elementary to high school. Tilleczek also built and founded the Qualitative Research Co-laboratory through funding from the Canadian Foundation for Innovation which then became the Young Lives Research Laboratory (YLRL). During her tenure at UPEI, Tilleczek and her research team started the Wekimün School Project on Chiloé Island, which aimed to bring education to rural areas. Through collaboration with the community, they created a school and curriculum for the Indigenous youth using their knowledge and life experiences. She was also the recipient of the CEA Whitworth Award for her research on marginalized students and their transitions through the education system. In 2018, Tilleczek was offered a position as Full Professor at York University in Toronto, along with an appointment as a Tier 1 Canada Research Chair (CRC) in Young Lives, Education and Global Good. While at York, Tilleczek continued to develop the YLRL as a virtual Lab with the intention of removing geographical, linguistic, structural, and technological boundaries to knowledge and learning. As the lead investigator at her Lab, she conducted a five-year long study of youth (ages 16-24) in Canada, Australia, and Scotland to determine whether living immersed in digital technology could harm or benefit them. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Tilleczek also studied how youth used the social media app Tik Tok to vent their frustrations and its effect on their overall health. However, she also cautioned parents against setting strict limitations to screen time and encouraged them to work with their children to see how they use their online time. She says that \\"parents need to figure out if what they’re doing online is active, creative, educative or is it just digital junk.\\" Along with her duties at York, Tilleczek also sits on and leads various committees including; Pathways to Education Canada, Canadian Education Association Canada, and Community Health Systems Resource Group.

By the time she attended primary school, the Cultural Revolution had finished and the educational system had been restored. Sun studied engineering at the Harbin Institute of Technology. Here she worked in the Department of Precision Instrumentation, where she earned a master's degree in 1993 and doctorate in 1998. On her holidays from university, Sun's commute back to her parent's house would last 34 hours. She moved to City, University of London for a second doctorate, during which she researched optical fibres, and graduated in 1999.  Research and career  After earning her doctorate Sun joined Nanyang Technological University where she worked as an Assistant Professor until 2001. She moved back to City, University of London in 2001. When she was promoted to Professor in 2008 she became the first woman to be promoted to Professor of engineering at City. She also serves as Director of the Research Centre for Photonics and Instrumentation. Her research involves the development of optical fibre sensors to monitor sensitive equipment in extreme environments. Her research has contributed to several different technologies, including drug detection, corrosion monitoring and combating food spoilage. She has worked with the Home Office and Smiths Group. In 2007 Sun co-founded Sengenia Ltd, a fibre sensing spin-out. She has developed humidity sensors that can withstand challenging environments such as acidic sewers in Sydney and rice stores in China. Sun continues to work with researchers at the Shandong Academy of Sciences on the implementation of optical fibres in the mining industry .

She is working with AECOM and Indian Institutes of Technology to enhance the sustainability of cities in India. This research was recognised with one of the most successful projects funded by the UK-India Education Research Initiative. Sun designed a sensor system that could be used to measure strain and temperature in pantographs, the connectors that are used to link overhead power cables in for electric trains. These devices are essential for train function and routine checks can miss important information. The optical sensors developed by Sun can continuously monitor pantograph behaviour during operation. The instrumented pantographs developed by Sun are currently being developed by Brecknell Willis. In 2018 Sun was awarded a Royal Academy of Engineering Research Chair to work with Brecknell Willis on new railway electrification systems. Sun is working on contactless electrification systems that integrate optical fibre sensors for continuous, in situ all-weather monitoring. The first pantographs went on service trial in 2019 and included Global Positioning System and video equipment.

The building also houses the 'Kunst-Station Sankt Peter', a centre for contemporary art, music and literature. History St. Peter and St. Cäcilien in 1665 Interior, 1895 The present building was constructed in the Gothic style between 1513 and 1525 on the remains of earlier Roman and Romanesque churches, making it the latest surviving Gothic church in the city. It is one of the churches maintained and supported by the Förderverein Romanische Kirchen Köln. The surviving Romanesque west tower dates to 1170. It and the nearby Cäcilienkirche are the city's only two surviving double- churches, which combined a parish church with a collegiate church or Stiftkirche. In the night bombing raid on 29 June 1943, known as the \\"Peter- und-Paul-Angriffs\\" (Peter and Paul attack), the church's parish was almost completely destroyed, with the church building itself leveled to its foundations and its pillars destroyed. Efforts were made to secure the more important pieces of church furniture such as the stained glass and altarpieces, but much of the opulent woodwork such as the altars, pulpits and 1907 organ in its 1820 case were lost to the fire. Initial measures were put in place to make the site safe in 1950 and the rest of the restoration was almost complete by 1960, led by government architects Karl Band and Wilhelm Schorn. With few resources and a prevailing consensus to emphasize what had been lost, Band's restoration was \\"sensitive, but ultimately [left the interior] only as a fragment\\", producing an almost Protestant effect compared to its pre-war appearance.Weiser 2002, p. 85Weiser 2002, S. 85 A redbrick nave contrasted with a raised bluestone chancel, while a new dark wood coffered ceiling was added – the city conservator Hiltrud Kier remarked that the ceiling's effect \\"was similar to a coffin lid\\"Kier 1997, p. 83. She also stated that the new vaulted ceilings between the clerestory windows were \\"like architectural tears\\" reminiscent of the lost vaultingKier 1997, p. 83. Only a few restored or reconstructed furnishings were placed in the building, including the medieval font and the wrought iron Baroque grille. In July 1960 the Jesuits took over the church and in September of that year one of them, Alois Schuh, was made the parish priest. A new, simple stone high-altar was later added and in 1961 the altarpieces by Cornelius Schut (The Conversion of St Peter) and Rubens returned to the church;Schlimbach 2015, p. 47 and the surviving stained glass windows were reinstalled. The building was restored again between 1997 and 2000 to designs by Wiegmann & Trübenbach.

He contributed significantly to the understanding of auditory physiology and bioacoustics of bats and marine mammals. Bertel Møhl was born in Copenhagen in 1936, as oldest son of paleozoologist and taxidermist Ulrik Møhl and potter Elka Lütken Petersen. He studied zoology at University of Copenhagen and graduated in 1965 (Mag.Scient.), worked first at the NATO funded Porpoise Research station in Strib, Denmark, then as postdoctoral fellow with professor Keith Ronald at University of Guelph and finally as associate professor in sensory physiology at Aarhus University, where he remained until his retirement in 2007. His early work dealt with anatomy and physiology of hearing in true seals, which included the first description of the soft tissue anatomy of the pinniped middle ear, the first audiogram of a pinniped and studies of the electrophysiology of the seal cochlea. Together with Ken Norris he published a seminal paper in 1983 on the so-called acoustic big-bang theory, in which it was proposed that toothed whales might be able to generate sounds loud enough to incapacitate or even kill their prey. Although the theory is no longer consistent with experimental data, the paper itself served as a significant inspiration for studies in odontocete bioacoustics and in the experimental approach to testing the hypothesis a number of significant findings were made, including the loudest sound pressures ever measured from any animal (from sperm whales); the first odontocete feeding sounds recorded in the wild (narwhals); first experimental evidence for the sound transmission pathway in the sperm whale nose; and the hyperdirectionality of the sperm whale echolocation sound beam. In the 1970s and 1980s Bertel Møhl concurrently studied biosonar in bats. He was particularly interested in the nature of the detection process and through a series of experiments provided substantial evidence against the at the time dominant theory of coherent signal processing by the bat auditory system.

It consists of a complex of lava domes and lava flows with a total volume of and bears traces of a former glaciation, even though it does not currently carry glaciers. Volcanic activity took place during the Pleistocene and the last eruption was 250,000 years ago; since then Uturuncu has not erupted but active fumaroles occur in the summit region. The volcano rises within the Altiplano- Puna volcanic complex, a larger province of large volcanoes and calderas which over the last few million years have emplaced about in sometimes very large eruptions. The volcano has two summits, with a fumarole field between them. Underneath it lies the so-called Altiplano-Puna magmatic body, a large sill formed by partially molten rocks. Starting in 1992, satellite observations have indicated a large area of regional uplift centered on Uturunku, which has been interpreted as an indication of large-scale magma intrusion under the volcano. This might be a prelude to large-scale volcanic activity, including \\"supervolcanic\\" activity and caldera formation.  Geography and geomorphology  Uturuncu lies in the Sur Lípez area of southern Bolivia, southeast of the town of Quetena and just northeast of the Eduardo Avaroa Andean Fauna National Reserve in the Cordillera de Lípez. A former sulfur mine is situated on the mountain, close to the summit, and was considered to be one of the highest in the world; a winding road leads up on the mountain and additional roads pass along the northern, eastern and southwestern foot of Uturuncu. The region is almost uninhabited and the volcano was little known until ongoing large-scale ground deformation was discovered in the early 21st century; since then scientific interest has increased, including a reconnaissance mission carried out by scientists in 2003. Additionally, the volcano has been used to reconstruct the regional history of glaciation. The term means \\"jaguar\\" in the Quechua language. = Structure = With elevation, Uturuncu is the highest mountain in southwestern Bolivia and dominates its geomorphology, rising about above the surrounding terrain and giving a good view of the surrounding mountains from the summit. The volcano has two summit peaks and high, about apart and separated by a high saddle. It is a stratovolcano with remnants of a crater, and consists of lava domes and lava flows erupted from a number of vents in the central part of the volcano. About 105 lava flows propagate outward from the central sector of the volcano, reaching lengths of and featuring levees, flow ridges and steep, blocky fronts over thick. The northernmost lava flow is known as Lomo Escapa and with a length of it is also the largest lava flow at Uturuncu. Five lava domes south, west and northwest of the summit form a northwest-southeast trending alignment that appears to be an older volcanic system; the southern of these domes have volumes of about and the western dome bears traces of a large collapse. The broad edifice covers an area of about and a volume of -. It appears to consist entirely of lava flows and lava domes; while the occurrence of pyroclastic flow deposits was reported at first later research has not found any evidence of explosive eruptions. Aside from volcanic deposits there are also traces of glaciation which has smoothened the slopes of Uturuncu, as well as Pleistocene and Holocene alluvium and colluvium. = Lakes and rivers = Several lakes surround Uturuncu. Mama Khumu lies on the eastern foot of Uturuncu and is bordered by steep slopes, while Laguna Celeste is located northeast, Chojllas southeast and Loromayu south of Uturuncu respectively. Beach terraces, deposits of diatomaceous earth and former shorelines are visible around the lakes. The Rio Grande de Lipez flows along the western foot of the volcano and receives tributaries which originate close to Uturuncu's northeastern foot; it eventually flows into the Salar de Uyuni. These watercourses are usually confined between steep bedrock walls and are characterized by a gravelly beds, anastomosing channels and wetlands which are used to keep llamas and sheep.  Geology  = Regional = The eastward subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South America Plate has generated three volcanic belts within the Andes, including the Central Volcanic Zone which spans parts of Peru, Chile, Bolivia and Argentina and includes Uturuncu. Aside from Uturuncu, it includes about 69 Holocene volcanoes in a high elevation region, including the potentially active volcanoes Irruputuncu, Olca-Paruma, Aucanquilcha, Ollagüe, Azufre, San Pedro, Putana, Sairecabur, Licancabur, Guayaques, Colachi and Acamarachi. = Local = Uturuncu has formed about east of the main volcanic front in the Western Cordillera, in a terrain formed by various volcanic and sedimentary rocks of Miocene to Quaternary age. The region is characterized by the Altiplano high plateau, which reaches an elevation of and in terms of dimension is only exceeded by Tibet. The 8.41 million years old Vilama and 5.65 million years old Guacha ignimbrites underlie the volcano and crop out in the Quetena River valley, while the 4 million years old Vilama lavas are found southwest of Uturuncu and are partly buried by the volcano. The crust in the region is about thick. Volcanic activity in the area occurred between 15 and 10 million years ago, and Cerro San Antonio, a heavily eroded 3 million years old Miocene volcano with a westward-opening collapse scar, lies just north of Uturuncu. Other volcanoes from east counterclockwise to west are the Cerro Panizos caldera, Cerro Lípez, Suni K'ira and Quetena volcanoes as well as many more minor volcanic centres. Many of them are formed along northwest-southeast trending lineaments such as the Lipez-Coranzuli and Pastos Grandes-Cojina lineament that passes through Uturuncu. = Geologic history and Altiplano- Puna volcanic complex = The geological history of the region is complex. After subduction commenced in the Jurassic, 26 million years ago the breakup of the Farallon Plate into the Cocos Plate and the Nazca Plate was accompanied by an increased subduction rate and the onset of the Andean Orogeny. This subduction process at first involved a relatively flat descend of the Nazca Plate until 12 million years ago, after which it steepened. Beginning from 10 million years ago then the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex formed, with a \\"flare-up\\" occurring during the Miocene. It covers an area of - of the Altiplano-Puna in Argentina, Bolivia and Chile and consists of a number of calderas, composite volcanoes and about of ignimbrite. Uturuncu lies at its centre but unlike Uturuncu most surrounding volcanic systems have been characterized by explosive eruptions, including several so-called \\"supereruptions\\" with volcanic explosivity indexes of 8 at Cerro Guacha, La Pacana, Pastos Grandes and Vilama. Over 50 volcanoes in the region are potentially active. Within the last two million years, the Laguna Colorada, Tatio and Puripica Chico ignimbrites were erupted in the surrounding terrain. The 4 million years old Atana and 3 million years old Pastos Grandes ignimbrites are other large ignimbrites in the area while the 10.33 ± 0.64 million years old San Antonio ignimbrite is more sparse. The Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex is underpinned at about depth by a wide magmatic sill where rocks are partially molten, the Altiplano-Puna magmatic body. Its existence has been established with various techniques; it extends over an area of and has a volume of about with a thickness variously estimated to be between ; it has been referred to as the largest reservoir of magma in the continental crust of Earth. The Altiplano-Puna magmatic body is the source of magmas for many of the volcanoes in the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex; in addition, about of brine are contained in the rocks underneath Uturuncu. = Composition and magma genesis = Uturuncu has erupted dacite but also andesite in the form of inclusions within the dacite. Rocks are vesicular or porphyric and contain phenocrysts of biotite, clinopyroxene, hornblende, ilmenite, magnetite, orthopyroxene, plagioclase and quartz along with apatite, monazite and zircon within a rhyolite groundmass, and define a potassium-rich calc- alkaline suite. Xenoliths consisting of gneiss, igneous rocks and norites have also been found, of which the first two appear to be derived from country rocks while the third is a by-product of the magma generation process. Additionally, the occurrence of cumulates, gabbros, hornfels, limestones and sandstones as xenolithic phases has been reported. Mixing processes involving hotter or more mafic magmas played a role in the genesis of Uturuncu rocks, as did fractional crystallization processes and contamination with crustal rocks. The origin of these magmas appears to relate to the Altiplano-Puna magmatic body, which generates melts through differentiation of basaltic magmas first to andesites and then to dacites before being transferred to the shallow crust below Uturuncu from where it was then erupted through buoyancy-dependent processes. Magma composition has been stable over the history of the volcano.  Glaciation  Uturuncu currently features no glaciers; however, perennial ice was reported in 1956, the existence of sporadic snow fields in 1994, and the summit area is occasionally ice-covered. Conversely, evidence of past glaciation such as glacial striations, glacially eroded valleys, both recessional and terminal moraines and roches moutonnées can be found on the northern, eastern and southern flanks of Uturuncu. The past glaciation of Uturuncu was not very extensive, owing to its steep flanks. One of these valleys on Uturuncu's southwestern flank has been subject to glaciology studies, which identified a former glacier originating both from the summit and from an area about south of the summit. This only weakly erosive glacier deposited five sets of up to high moraines within the shallow valley; the lowest of these lies at elevation and appears to be a product of an early last glacial maximum between 65,000 and 37,000 years ago, earlier than the global last glacial maximum. Afterwards, not much retreat occurred until 18,000 years ago. Conversely, the uppermost of these moraines is about 16,000 – 14,000 years old and correlates to a glacial advance in the Altiplano that has been correlated to the maximum growth of the former Lake Tauca north of Uturuncu and a wet and cold climate associated with Heinrich event 1. At this same time 17,000 – 13,000 years ago, shorelines formed around the lakes that surround Uturuncu; Lake Tauca may have been a source of moisture for Uturuncu. After 14,000 the glacier receded at the same time as climate warmed during the Bolling-Allerod warming and the region became drier.  Climate and vegetation  There is little information on local climatology, but mean annual precipitation is about or even less than that, most of it originating in the Amazon basin to the east and falling during December, January and February. This low amount of precipitation is not adequate to sustain glaciers even though the summit of Uturuncu lies above the freezing level, but it is enough to generate a seasonal snowcap on the mountain. Annual temperatures in the region range between . The regional vegetation is relatively sparse at high elevations and gets classified as Puna grassland, with low biodiversity. Quinoa woods and Polylepis trees are found on the lower slopes of the volcano; the trees reach height. Birds such as flamingoes make up much of the animal life in the area and are concentrated at open waterbodies. Andean mountain cats, southern viscachas and vicuñas form the rest of the animal life.  Eruption history  Uturuncu was active during the Pleistocene, with a lower unit emplaced during the lower and middle Pleistocene (890,000–549,000 years ago) and which makes up most of the peripheral sectors of the volcano and an upper unit of middle to upper Pleistocene age (427,000–271,000 years ago) which makes up its central sector and is less extensive. Several rocks have been dated through argon-argon dating and have yielded ages ranging from 1,050,000 ± 5,000 to 250,000 ± 5,000 years ago; among these dates are 271,000 ± 26,000 years ago for rocks in the summit area, 250,000 ± 5,000 for the youngest dated lava flow found just south-southeast of the summit and 544,000 years for the Lomo Escapa lava flow, while the aligned lava domes have been dated to be between 549,000 ± 3,000 and 1,041,000 ± 12,000 years old. Overall, Uturuncu was active for about 800,000 years. Volcanic eruptions at Uturuncu were effusive and involved the emission of voluminous lava flows () between pauses lasting between 50,000 and 180,000 years, with a mean eruption rate of less than -, much less than other rhyolitic volcanoes. There is no evidence of large ignimbrite eruptions nor of large flank collapses but some lavas may have interacted with water or ice as they were erupted and were reportedly emplaced over moraines. = Holocene and fumarolic activity = No large effusive eruptions have occurred since the 250,000 ± 5,000 eruption, and Holocene or recent eruptions have not been reported. While it was at first proposed that postglacial lavas existed it is now known that the volcano has been dormant since 271,000 years ago and glaciation has affected the youngest lava flows. The volcano is considered to be dormant. Fumaroles on Uturuncu Active fumaroles occur in two fields below the summit, with a number of tiny vents located between the two summit peaks; vapour emissions are visible from close distance. The summit fumaroles have temperatures of less than and their gases contain large quantities of carbon dioxide, water and larger amounts of hydrogen sulfide than sulfur dioxide perhaps due to the latter being filtered out by a hydrothermal system. The fumaroles have emplaced abundant sulfur and silification has been observed. Satellite images have observed relatively invariant temperature anomalies (\\"hot spots\\") on Uturuncu between its two summit peaks; these temperature anomalies of about are among the largest fumarole fields visible to satellites. The existence of intense fumarolic activity on the northwestern slope at was already reported in 1956. Additionally, a spring on the northwestern flank produces water with temperatures of . The presence of a weak hydrothermal system is likely at Uturuncu albeit probably at great depth, considering the low temperature and spread out nature of the fumarolic activity. There may be a shallow magma chamber below the volcano at depth below sea level.  Recent unrest and threats  InSAR imaging has discovered that a region of about around Uturuncu is uplifting. Between 1992 and 2006, the uplift amounted to in an area wide but with variations over time such as a temporary acceleration after a 1998 earthquake, a gradual slowdown either continuing or followed by an acceleration to about in the few years before 2017, along with seasonal variations. Overall, the total volume change between 1992 and 2006 was about , with a total volume change of about ; such rates are typical for intrusions in the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex and historical lava dome eruptions and might reflect a short-term rate. The deformation is centered on an area west of the summit and is most likely of magmatic origin given the lack of a large hydrothermal system at the volcano and the depth of the deformation. The form of the deforming structure is not well known but it lies presumably at a depth of below sea level. The uplifting area is surrounded by a ring-shaped area of subsidence, which is occurring at a rate of ; the total width of deforming terrain is about although is it not clearly visible in all InSAR data. This joint uplift-subsidence has been called a \\"sombrero pattern\\" and the subsidence may reflect either a sideward or an upward migration of magma. A second, shallow subsidence area has been found south of Uturuncu which may relate to changes in a hydrothermal system. The deformation it most likely caused by magma intruding into the crust from the Altiplano-Puna magmatic body, with the intrusion taking place at a level below that where magma accumulated prior to past eruptions of Uturuncu. It has been described as an ascending diapir or as a growing pluton although an alternative theory holds the ascent of volatiles along a magma column reaching to the Altiplano-Puna magmatic body as responsible for the surface deformation; in that case the uplift might reverse over time. Such surface uplift has been observed at other volcanic centres in the Central Volcanic Zone but on global scale it is unusual both for its long duration and its spatial extent, and in the case of Uturuncu demonstrates the continuing activity of the Altiplano-Puna magmatic body. In addition, there is no evidence for a net uplift in the geomorphology of the region, and findings in the terrain around Uturuncu indicate that this uplift certainly began less than 1,000 years ago and likely also less than 100 years ago. The uplift might be either a temporary deformation of the volcano that eventually deflates over time, or the current uplift might only be in its beginning stage. The term \\"zombie volcano\\" has been coined to describe volcanoes like Uturuncu which have been inactive for a long time but are actively deforming. = Seismicity = In addition, the volcano features persistent seismic activity with occasional bursts of higher activity; about three or four earthquakes occur every day at the volcano, and seismic swarms lasting minutes to hours with up to 60 earthquakes occur several times per month. The intensities of the earthquakes reach . Most of this seismic activity occurs below the summit of Uturuncu around sea level and some earthquakes appear to relate to the northwest-southeast tectonic trend of the region although swarms occur in several areal clusters. Whether there are long-term trends in seismic activity is difficult to estimate as the detection and reconnaissance techniques of seismic activity at Uturuncu have changed over time. This amount of seismic activity is large when compared to neighbouring volcanoes and the seismic activity may be a consequence of the deformation, as intruding magma pressurizes and destabilizes local faults, with further triggering possible by large earthquakes such as the 2010 Maule earthquake which triggered an intense seismic swarm in February 2010. = Tomographic studies = Magnetotelluric imaging of the volcano has found a number of high-conductivity anomalies below Uturuncu, including a wide, deep conductor that extends to the volcanic arc to the west and several shallower ones which ascend from the deep conductor which appears to coincide with the Altiplano-Puna magmatic body. The shallow conductors appear to relate to local volcanoes such as the Laguna Colorada vent but also Uturuncu; the latter conductor lies between depth, is less than wide and may consists of molten rock with saline aqueous fluids. Seismic tomography has found a tooth-shaped anomaly that begins at depth and continues to over of depth. Such structures have been found at other volcanoes and explained by the presence of magma. Seismic activity concentrates at the top of this anomaly. Finally, tectonic stress patterns delineate a wide ring surrounding the volcano that may be prone to fracturing; such a ring could constitute a future pathway for magma transport or the margin of a future caldera. = Threats = Whether the ongoing unrest at Uturuncu is part of a benign process of pluton growth or the prelude of a new eruption or even a caldera-forming eruption is an open question; a large caldera-forming eruption could have catastrophic, globe- spanning consequences as demonstrated by the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora in Indonesia and the 1600 eruption of Huaynaputina in Peru; this possibility has resulted in international media attention. Evidence does not clearly indicate that a future \\"super-eruption\\" such as past events in the region is possible and there is no indication for a near-future eruption, but there is certainly potential for a smaller eruption.

Biography Kidston was born in Glasgow and studied at the Glasgow School of Art from 1914 to 1920. She then spent some time in Paris where she trained with André Lhote at Académie de la Grande Chaumière before returning to Scotland and spending three years as the head of the art department at Laurel Bank School in Glasgow. Kidston left that post in 1926 and enrolled at the Slade School of Fine Art in London where she was taught wood engraving by Thomas Smith. In 1927 Kidston joined the Glasgow Society of Lady Artists and the following year won the Societies' Lauder Award. During World War II Kidston worked for the Committee for the Education for the Forces, running art and painting classes for troops, many from Poland, stationed in St Andrews during the conflict. Living in St Andrews, Kidston became a member of a group of artists, that included Józef Sękalski and Alison McKenzie and Winifred McKenzie, that sought to promote wood engraving and became known as the St Andrews School. Kidston went on to hold a number of posts in the group and also spent some time between 1947 and 1950 as a part-time lecturer at the Dundee College of Art.

It is mostly found in western part of Istria. It is a late-ripening variety and grows in large clusters with densely packed berries. Berries have highly resistant skin and deep ruby red color. The vine requires a lot of sun but less water. It is sensitive, both to extremely strong sun (burning hazard) and to excessive humidity (botrytis). When the grapes are fully ripe and all other needed conditions are met, a very good quality red wine can be made from them. Its alcohol content is usually between 11 and 14%.  History  Teran has been grown in the Istrian peninsula for centuries. According to some sources, it has been part of Istria's identity for more than 650 years. At the end of the 19th century it was planted approximately on 90% of all vineyards in Istria and hence was the most widespread grape variety in Istria. Today it still remains the most common red grape variety in the region covering around 400 hectares. It is protected by the delegated act on wine labels of the European Commission in 2017.  Wine  Teran wine is traditionally produced from teran grapes. It is considered as one of the highest quality red wines on the market, having rich and robust character. The wine is known for its persistency and slightly higher acidity than other similar wines and is best served at about 18 degrees Celsius. The quality of the wine can depend on the location as well as on the conditions in the vineyard. Its colour is ruby-red, almost purple, and it has high tannins and a typical, fruity aroma which is easy to recognize. Different yeast type can influence the quality of teran wine as well. Teran wine differs from Kraški teran wine (), which is produced from Refošk () grape variety, grown in Istrian hinterland.

In 1918, after the Bolshevik Revolution, he was a founder and member of the Central Committee of the Ukrainian Communist Party. He was caught organising guerilla detachments to fight against the government of Symon Petliura and was sentenced to be shot. He escaped, but was wounded, and had to hide out until the arrival of the Red Army. He was wounded and captured again while fighting against the White army commanded by General Denikin, but escaped. In 1920-22, Drobnis was Chairman of the executive of the Poltava Soviet. During this period, he was kidnapped by bandits who held him hostage in a cellar until the Red Army secured his release. In this period, he supported the Democratic Centralist opposition group, led by Timofei Sapronov and Vladimir M. Smirnov. He was recalled from Ukraine in 1922, because of his involvement with the Democratic Centralists, and worked the government of the Russian Federation for year, then in 1923-27, for Administrative and Financial Commission of the USSR government. Drobnis signed the Declaration of the Forty-Six in 1923, and backed Trotsky in the split that opened up within the Communist Party after the death of its founder, Vladimir Lenin. In 1924, Drobnis was passed a letter written by a fellow oppositionist named Pililenko, who called for mass recruitment to the left opposition, and reputedly advocated creating a breakaway political party. He showed it to V.M.Smirnov. When the party authorities found out, Pililenko was expelled, and Drobnis received a severe reprimand. He was expelled from the communist party in December 1927. In 1929, he was arrested and deported to Siberia, but in 1930 he renounced the opposition and was reinstated as a party member.  Arrest and execution  Drobnis was arrested again on 6 August 1936. On 23 September, there was an explosion in a mine in Kemerovo, in Siberia, close to where he was employed in 1934-36 as an assistant director of the Kemerovo Chemical Works. Though it was probably an accident, the NKVD treated it as sabotage, and forced Drobnis to confess his role in planning the explosion. He appeared as a witness when the director and eight others employed at the mine were put on trial in Novosibirsk on 19–22 November. In January 1937, he appeared as a defendant alongside Yuri Pyatakov, Karl Radek and others at the second of three major Moscow show trials, where he confessed to having organised the explosion on Trotsky's orders, and pleaded with the court: \\"If you find it in the least possible to save me from shameful death, and, after putting me to the severest test, permit me to return to the ranks of the class from which I came, I shall regard it as my great and sacred duty fully to justify this gift.\\". He was sentenced to death on 30 January 1937, and shot two days later. Drobnis was posthumously rehabilitated and reinstated in the Communist Party in 1988.

It is part of the Joffre Group, which is a subset of the Lillooet Ranges. It is situated east of Pemberton, midway between Mount Matier and Mount Spetch, each a half kilometre either side of Hartzell. The mountain's name was submitted by Karl Ricker of the Alpine Club of Canada to honor Carl A. Hartzell, an early settler and postmaster at Pemberton. The name was officially adopted on January 23, 1979, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into Joffre Creek and Twin One Creek, both tributaries of the Lillooet River. The mountain and its climate supports the Hartzell Glacier on the southeast slope, and the Matier Glacier on the northern slope. Climate Mount Hartzell's west face as seen from Slalok Mountain Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Hartzell is located in a subarctic climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Mount Hartzell.

History Drawing by Paul Sandby (1731–1809) Askeaton Abbey was founded for the Order of Friars Minor Conventual by Gerald FitzGerald, 3rd Earl of Desmond between 1389 and 1400; or by James FitzGerald, 6th Earl of Desmond in 1420. The abbey was reformed under the Order of Friars Minor in 1490; it was reformed again in 1513 and a provincial chapter held there in 1564. Askeaton was plundered and later abandoned by Nicholas Malby's men in 1579 during the Second Desmond Rebellion, and some of the friars were killed. It was revived in 1627 and abandoned in 1648 when Cromwell’s forces neared. It was reestablished in 1658 and continued to house friars until 1714. Remains Plan of the friary The church and its north transept, sacristy, cloister arcade and domestic buildings survive. Notable features include the cloister with its carvings of Francis of Assisi with stigmata, a Mass dial, sedilia, several Fitzgerald dynasty tombs, and a carving of Christ as the Man of Sorrows.

Kingdom worked as a seaman before becoming a firefighter. He joined the National Union of Corporation Workers, and when the firemen's branch split away to form the Firemen's Trade Union, he became increasingly prominent in the new union. In 1929, Kingdom was elected as general secretary, and the following year renamed it as the Fire Brigades Union. In 1931, the London County Council cut firemen’s wages, arguing that Metropolitan Police wages had also been cut. Kingdom argued that firemen's working hours should also be cut, to match those of the police. He was unsuccessful, but in 1932 he achieved an agreement that firemen's wages would thereafter follow those of the police when they were increased, and this happened in 1934. At the 1934 London County Council election, the Labour Party won control of the council, and Kingdom hoped it would agree a 48 hour maximum working week for firefighters. Herbert Morrison disagreed, and the two became involved in a public dispute. On the outbreak of World War II, Kingdom was reluctant to accept members of the new Auxiliary Fire Service as members of the union, and when they did join, did little to represent them. In protest, three London firefighters, Bradley, Randall and Merrells, John Horner to stand against Kingdom for the general secretary post. Kingdom resigned as general secretary, without giving an explanation, and Horner won an election to replace him.

It is different from a memory-bound function; the latter incurs cost by slowing down computation through memory latency. MHFs find their use as a form of proof of work.  Memory hard measure  There are different ways to measure the memory hardness of a function. A commonly seen measure is Cumulative Memory Complexity (CMC). In a parallel model, CMC measures memory hardness by summing up all the inputs on each step. (AS15) Alwen, Serbineko, High Parallel Complexity Graphs and Memory-Hard Functions, 2015 Another viable measure is integrating memory against physical time.(MO16) Moran, Orlov, Simple Proofs of Space-Time and Rational Proofs of Storage, 2016 Yet another measure is the memory bandwidth consumption on a memory bus.(BR18) Blocki, Ren, Bandwidth-Hard Functions: Reductions and Lower Bounds, 2018 This category of functions are also dubbed \\"bandwidth-hard functions\\".  Motivation  There is a reason why MHFs cost a lot of memory instead of, say, CPU cycles. Bitcoin used repeated evaluation of SHA-2 function as proof of work, but it turned out that modern general-purpose processors, i.e. off-the-shelf CPUs, are very inefficient when tasked to compute a fixed function over and over. Miners adopted application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and achieved 10^16 speedup. While this is fine for what Bitcoin is good for, we want a more \\"egalitarian\\" hardness measure. In other words, we want everyone to be equally inefficient in computing the function even if they have an ASIC. Because if some people can evaluate the function efficiently and some can't, then in order to make the function relatively hard for the short-cut takers, we will make the function too hard for a regular user. If everyone is inefficient, then everyone can evaluate a moderately-hard function. Over time, it has been recognized that memory cost remains fairly equal across the board. Hence MHF.  Variants  Based on their evaluation patterns, MHFs can be put into two camps: data-dependent (dMHF) and data-independent (iMHF). dMHFs are that which sometimes you don't know which pieces of information you would still need for later calculations, and iMHFs are ones that there's no such ambiguity. Examples of dMHFs are scrypt and Argon2d. Examples of iMHFs are Argon2i and catena. Many of these MHFs are developed to be used as password hashing functions exactly because of their memory hardness. dMHFs have the glaring problem that they are prone to side-channel attacks like cache timing. People tend toward iMHFs for this reason, especially for password hashing. However, iMHFs are mathematically proven to have weaker memory hardness properties than dMHFs. Construction =depth-robust graph= For iMHFs in the parallel random oracle model (pROM), it is a known fact that the cumulative pebbling complexity is lower-bounded and upper-bounded by the depth-robustness of a graph. =scrypt= =bit- reversal-graph= References Category:Cryptography ","title":"Memory-hard function"},{"id":"62379098","text":"Seance is an upcoming American-British horror film written and directed by Simon Barrett.

Family background Servius belonged to the patrician gens Cornelia, one of the oldest and most successful gentes of the Republic; no other gens had more consulships than the Cornelii. The cognomen Maluginensis is the first recorded among the Cornelii; it was first borne by Servius Cornelius, also the first consul of the gens.

In 1940 the tanker was requisitioned by the Kriegsmarine and converted to a support ship for naval operations in the Atlantic. On the first mission in July 1941, to support commerce raiding by the German battleship and cruiser , Gedania was captured and taken into service with the British Ministry of War Transport as Empire Garden. In 1947 it returned to commercial service as Southern Garden with the South Georgia Company, transporting whale oil from the southern Atlantic, and carrying supplies and personnel to the whaling stations. The tanker was broken up in 1960. Construction The steam tanker Gedania was launched in September 1919 by Howaldtswerke at Kiel, as Yard No 587, and given a Latin name for Danzig. It was the first of a pair ordered before World War I by Deutsch-Amerikanische Petroleum Gesellschaft (DAPG, German-American Petroleum Company), the German subsidiary of Standard Oil of New Jersey (the other, Yard No 588 was completed in 1921 as Vistula). As built, Gedania had a length of , a beam of , and a depth of . The tanker measured and . It was powered by a 4-cylinder quadruple expansion engine of 404nhp, also made by Howaldtswerke, driving a single screw propeller, giving the ship a service speed of . Registry and civilian career In 1919, before the two ships were completed, they were transferred to Baltisch-Amerikanische Petroleum Import Gesellschaft (BAPIG), a Standard Oil subsidiary in the Free City of Danzig, and registered there in order not to be included in the war reparations arrangements under the Treaty of Versailles of 1919 which caused DAPG to lose their German-flag ships. During her service with BAPIG, the vessel was largely used to transport oil from the ports of Gulf Coast of the United States and Mexico to Germany. Wilhelm Anton Riedemann was one of Standard Oil's partners in DAPG, which in 1928 was renamed Waried Tankschiff Rhederei GmbH, of Hamburg; two years later that company became the ship manager of Gedania. In 1933 the tanker's ownership was transferred to the Waried company and registry changed from Danzig to Hamburg, under German flag. In 1922 a Bauer-Wach low pressure exhaust turbine was additionally fitted, increasing the engine power from 404nhp to 462nhp and 3000ihp. Requisition When the Second World War started, Gedania was sailing from Aruba to Germany. To avoid capture, the ship was forced to seek refuge in the Port of Las Palmas in the Canary Islands. On 1 October 1940 Gedania was requisitioned by the Kriegsmarine and ordered to sail on 15 October 1940 to Saint-Nazaire to be outfitted, arriving on the 2 November 1940. In Saint-Nazaire, the ship was converted into a supply oiler for the German battleship and given the code name \\"Maikäfer\\" (cockchafer). Crew At the start of her military life, Gedania had a crew of 101 men of which 45 were Kriegsmarine sailors. The senior naval officer aboard was the ship's doctor. Outfitting and supplies The ship underwent extensive modification to expand the available space for supplies. The following structural changes were made: * Store rooms were to built below the main deck, for'ard. * A refrigerator was supplied and installed. * In the rear, store rooms for prisoners were created. Initially rooms for 300 prisoners were requested by the naval architect, Wilhelm Meyer, but the decision was made to only provide space for 120 people. * An ammunition store was created in the forward cargo space. * Two motorboats for use as escape craft were installed. * Two 7.5cm guns with large stereoscopic rangefinders along with four 2cm anti-aircraft guns were fitted to the after extended boat deck. * An Anschütz gyrocompass was fitted on the bridge. The following supplies were taken on in Saint-Nazaire in preparation for sailing: * 48 torpedoes with fitted warheads :* 48 torpedo pistols, detonators and primers :* 200 gallons of lubricating oil and a similar amount of torpedo fuel. * 500 shells and 500 cordite charges for 15cm guns. :* 1600 rounds of fixed 10.5cm ammunition :* 1000 rounds of fixed 7.5cm ammunition :* 2000 rounds of fixed 2.0cm ammunition * Large cargo of diesel and bunker oil * A collection of engineers tools and two 8inch lathes * A wireless transmitter (WT), a direction finder and two portable WT sets for use ashore. * A collection of canned provisions that included butter, sausages and fruit * A collection of frozen meat and vegetables that included bacon and potatoes that had started to rot by the time the ship was captured. Wartime operational cruise The Gedania sailed from Saint-Nazaire on 0800 on the 25 May 1941 and arrived at La Pallice at 2130 on the same day. At the port of La Pallice, the Gedania waited for further orders. After taking on some of fresh water, she sailed on the afternoon of 29 May with an escort of armed trawlers on a southerly bearing that would take her towards Bilbao. She then sailed west, following the coast of Spain, finally crossing the 44th parallel to the west of La Corunna. During the afternoon of 4 June 1941 at the position , the Gedania was intercepted by the ocean boarding vessel and after a chase that lasted two hours, the ship was captured and the whole crew were taken prisoner. A landing party visited the ship to search for any cryptographic material that may not have been destroyed and to sail her to Scotland. The crew had left scuttling charges as they had left the ship as per instructions, but the damage to the ship was insufficient to sink her and she was soon sufficiently repaired to enable her to be get under steam. Although the Gedania was a veteran of many cruises, her first military cruise was her last. The mission of the ship was initially thought to be as a supply ship for U-boats in the Southern Atlantic Ocean. However it was noticed that she held specific ammunition that could only be used by surface vessels as well as containing space for 120 prisoners, all indicative of a mission to supply surface craft. When the crew were questioned, some believed that the Gedania would rendezvous, if necessary with the and cruiser , although no specific instructions were provided. Certainly the initial mission of the ship seemed to be to sail into the Central Atlantic, then find and takeover the patrol of the supply tanker . The Gedania would have remained on position until all the torpedoes were transferred. Further orders were then to be issued by Western Command to both ships. British-flag service After capture, Gedania was taken to Greenock by the boarding crew, arriving on 12 June 1941. The tanker was renamed Empire Garden by the Ministry of War Transport (MoWT), registered in London (Official Number 168211) and placed under the management of Gow, Harrison & Co. Despite repairs in the UK of damage from the scuttling charges when converted to a naval tanker, it continued to require further attention during its MoWT service. The tanker was damaged by fire at Singapore in 1946, and only released by the Royal Navy in March 1947. The return voyage from Hong Kong to the UK via Abadan took six months, with stops for repairs in Singapore, Colombo and Karachi. While en route to the UK, Empire Garden was purchased from MoWT by the South Georgia Company Ltd., a subsidiary of Christian Salvesen Ltd, for service as a supply ship for the company's southern ocean whaling operations, based Leith Harbour, South Georgia Island. The ship was renamed Southern Garden and registered at Leith, Scotland. The accommodation added in 1940 intended for prisoners was upgraded to be used for transporting the crews of locally-based whale catchers and other employees. During the major refit the ship caught fire and when leaving Liverpool in May 1948 engine trouble developed requiring a return for repairs at Birkenhead, where another fire broke out. The ship had further engine trouble on her subsequent return from South Georgia and had to be assisted back before going to South Shields for extensive repairs. After returning from the 1959-1960 whaling season Southern Garden was laid up off Southend-on-Sea and sold in July 1960 to the British Iron & Steel Corporation (Salvage) Ltd. for demolition. Scrapping was carried out by Thomas W. Ward Ltd at Inverkeithing, Fife.

It is produced by Falcon Studios, directed by Matt Sterling, and stars Casey Donovan, Al Parker, and Dick Fisk. The film was Falcon's first feature-length release, and is noted as one of the first adult films to be published on videocassette. A critical and commercial success upon its release, The Other Side of Aspen is regarded as a landmark work of the Golden Age of Porn, and has been called one of the greatest gay pornographic films of all time. Plot In San Francisco, a skiing instructor (Jeff Turk) recounts to his friend (Mike Flynn) a particular incident that occurred during his recent visit to Aspen, Colorado. While traveling to instruct two clients (Al Parker and Casey Donovan), he witnessed two men (Chad Benson and Dick Fisk) having sex in a cabin. Upon arriving at his destination, he found his clients also having sex; they are subsequently joined by the men from the cabin and the instructor in an orgy. Having recounted the story, the instructor comments that he is aroused; he exposes his penis to his friend, who reaches for it. Cast * Casey Donovan * Al Parker * Dick Fisk * Chad Benson * Jeff Turk * Mike Flynn Production =Development= In fall 1977, Falcon Studios cameraman Colin Meyer suggested to the studio's founder Chuck Holmes that Falcon produce a film that featured the most famous performers from the three \\"generations\\" of gay adult film actors: Casey Donovan, the star of Boys in the Sand and the first ever gay porn star; Al Parker, a popular Colt Studios model who had appeared in several Falcon films; and the up-and-coming Dick Fisk. The film would become The Other Side of Aspen after a staffer at Falcon suggested making \\"a movie in the snow.\\" =Filming= The Other Side of Aspen's skiing and sex scenes were shot in Lake Tahoe, California. Holmes regularly took skiing trips, and filmed scenes for the studio on one such trip so he could claim the vacation as a write-off. The film's setting of Aspen, Colorado references the city's popularity as a destination for LGBT tourists; in 1979, the city was the first municipality in Colorado to pass a non-discrimination ordinance, and has hosted Aspen Gay Ski Week annually since that same year. At the time, gay pornographic films were typically eight- to 10-minute single- scene film loops that were shot and released individually on 8 mm film; The Other Side of Aspen was similarly shot as four individual scenes. After filming concluded in Lake Tahoe, Holmes, director Matt Sterling, and Falcon co-founder Vaughn Kincey elected to shoot additional scenes of dialogue in San Francisco. The dialogue scenes were edited between the sex scenes, giving the film a narrative with plot and continuity, and making The Other Side of Aspen the first feature film to be released by Falcon. Donovan and Parker met for the first time while flying Lake Tahoe to shoot the film. The film's first sex scene between Donovan and Parker was improvised; initiated as a still photography session, the encounter was filmed after the actors began to have sex of their own accord. During the encounter, Donovan was fisted by Parker; this was cut from the film's original 1978 release, but was included in its 2002 re-release. =Release= The Other Side of Aspen was heavily marketed in the lead-up to its release, an atypical approach for gay adult films at the time. As the majority of Falcon's business was conducted through mail order, reservation cards and a brochure promoting the film were sent to the top customers on Falcon's mailing list. The film would be released in all extant media formats of the time: standard 8 mm, Super 8, Sound 8, VHS, and Betamax, making The Other Side of Aspen one of the first adult films to be released on videocassette. The film was re-released on DVD in 2002, and a remastered version of the film was released in 2014. Reception and legacy The Other Side of Aspen was a major critical and commercial success upon its release, and has been called one of the greatest gay adult films ever made. By 1993, 45,000 copies of The Other Side of Aspen had been sold, making it the best- selling gay pornography film at that time and producing the highest revenues in Falcon's corporate history up to that point. The film cemented the legacy of Donovan and Parker, with writer Jeffrey Escoffier noting that the film \\"put Donovan back into the spotlight and confirmed Parker's celestial status.\\" The film is regarded as a turning point for the development of gay pornography as a genre and industry: its elevated production values were largely unprecedented at the time, and feature film-style releases would become the norm across the gay pornography industry in the wake of The Other Side of Aspen's success. It is also credited with popularizing the macho gay porn star aesthetic that would remain broadly popular in the decades subsequent to the film's release, with Escoffier writing that The Other Side of Aspen \\"crystallized Chuck Holmes' vision of the erotic movie [...] it signaled the culmination of the gay macho sexual ethos, the confirmation of the ideal gay male body–young, a swimmer's build, no tattoos, and little hair–and the codification of gay porn movies as a genre.\\" =Awards= In 2002, the film's re-release won Best Classic Gay DVD at the GayVN Awards, and Best Classic Video at the Grabby Awards. Sequels A total of five sequels to The Other Side of Aspen have been produced by Falcon, and often star the most popular performers of the film's given era. The film's sequels have received a largely lukewarm critical reaction, with Michael Joseph Gross arguing that the franchise has gone \\"mostly downhill\\" since the release of the original film. *The Other Side of Aspen II (1985), directed by Matt Sterling *The Other Side of Aspen III: Snowbound (1995), directed by John Rutherford *The Other Side of Aspen IV: The Rescue (1995), directed by John Rutherford *The Other Side of Aspen V (2001), directed by John Rutherford *The Other Side of Aspen VI (2011), directed by Chris Ward Notes References * External links * Category:1978 films Category:1978 in LGBT history Category:1978 LGBT-related films Category:1970s pornographic films Category:American films Category:Gay pornographic films ","title":"The Other Side of Aspen"},{"id":"62379118","text":"Sydney Ombler (born 1892) was a British trade unionist. Born in Kingston upon Hull, Ombler became a shipwright. He served with the Royal Engineers during World War I, then after the war returned to Hull and joined the Ship Constructive and Shipwrights' Association. He gradually rose to prominence in the union, serving as branch secretary for eighteen years. In 1936, he was elected to the union's executive committee, and in 1946, he became the union's assistant general secretary, narrowly defeating John McMillan in an election. The union's general secretary, John Willcocks, resigned in 1948, and Ombler won the election to succeed him. He complained that he could not afford a house suitable for his family on his salary, and so the union agreed to purchase a house for them. Under his leadership, employment in shipbuilding declined, as did the union's membership. He remained leader of the union until his retirement, in 1957. In the 1954 Birthday Honours, Ombler was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire.
