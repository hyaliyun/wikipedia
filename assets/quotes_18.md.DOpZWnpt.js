G. Wodehouse. A part of the Mr. Mulliner series, the story was first published in July 1926 in Strand Magazine, and appeared almost simultaneously in Liberty in the United States. It also appears in the collection Meet Mr. Mulliner.McIlvaine (1990), pp. 53‚Äì54, A38. Plot Overview George Mulliner, a nephew of Mr. Mulliner, was cursed with a terrible stammer but was not terribly concerned about it until he fell in love with Susan Blake, the daughter of the vicar of East Wobsley, the Worcestershire village in which they lived. Determined to get rid of the stammer, he visits a specialist in London who advises him to go and speak to three perfect strangers each day as a confidence building measure. George decides to do this immediately on the train back to London. Unfortunately, the first person he meets also stammers and to stammer back at this man 'would obviously be madness'. The second person he meets turns out to be a lunatic runaway from the local asylum who thinks he is the Emperor of Abyssinia and wishes to perform a human sacrifice with George playing the lucky lamb. George manages to escape and takes refuge under a bench seat in a railway carriage. A woman takes a seat in the same compartment, and when George emerges from under the bench and tries to speak to her, she assumes that George must be the escaped lunatic. When George, unable to speak, decides to sing instead she faints. When a thermos falls and shatters as the train passes over some points, she leaps up and pulls the emergency cord, bringing the train to a halt. When a host of rustics appear, George decides to remove himself and does so at a high speed followed by twenty-seven rustics headed by a bearded man with a pitchfork. Late that night, a bedraggled George appears at the vicarage and presents himself to Susan Blake. Cured of his stammer, he proposes and she accepts. The mob arrives and George removes himself again at top speed but his stammer is cured for ever.

In the 2001 census the parish had a population of 721 which increased to 969 at the 2011 Census.  Origin of name  A D Mills (2003) says it was a 'homestead or village of a man called G«£rbald'. It appeared in the Domesday Book (1086) as Gerboldesham. The traditional view of Gaerbold is that it is an Old English name, i.e. homestead of Garbold. Others argue it has a Viking origin with Garbold being a famous Viking. As described above, the boundary between Anglian, Viking and possibly even Iceni is blurred in the light of recent genetic and linguistic research. To the south of the village are the hamlets of Smallworth and Broomscot Common, the name of the latter according to some recalling the village's ancient pagan past, but more likely, so Carole Hough thinks, an affiliation to a Scandinavian with the surname Brun. This name might reflect the Viking invasions or Scandinavian connections of the Wuffingas, founders of the kingdom of East Anglia. It might even go further back in time if you believe theories that the pre-Roman Iceni inhabiting this area were Old English speakers rather than Cymric/Welsh.  Notable buildings  St John's Church The village contains a Post Office with independent shop, selling a range of groceries as well as East Anglian regional \\"gourmet\\" produce. On Church Road is Garboldisham Church of England School, a primary school with about 90 pupils. The school is next to Garboldisham's St John the Baptist Church and opposite the village hall. About 200 yards north is the ruined Garboldisham All Saints Church, where the 14th century western face collapsed into the nave in 1734. There is also a small Methodist chapel, situated south of the A1066. The Fox public house, on the crossroads of the A1066 and Hopton/Harling Road, closed in 2007 but was purchased by a village consortium in 2016 and reopened in December that year. Garboldisham Manor was a substantial house designed by George Gilbert Scott junior in the Jacobean style. The hall was demolished in 1952.  Village life  Garboldisham has active cricket teams. The \\"Garboldisham Road\\" was mentioned in the A Bit of Fry and Laurie sketches \\"Information\\" and \\"Strawberries and Cream\\". There is a 10-foot high Bronze Age round barrow on Garboldisham Heath, known locally as 'Soldier's Hill' and 'Boadicea's Grave', although there is no evidence that Queen Boudicca is buried here. Local antiquarian Basil Brown carried out an excavation at the mound around 1963, and uncovered a burial urn, some cremated human bone, two flint flakes and a flint scraper. The burial probably dates from around 1300 BC. John Winston Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough and grandfather of Sir Winston Churchill, was born in Garboldisham Hall in 1822.

It provides security forces to guard high-value naval installations, most notably those containing nuclear vessels and weapons. It also provides Fleet Anti-terrorism Security Teams (FAST) and Recapture Tactics Teams (RTT). Marines who complete Security Forces training are assigned a secondary Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) of 8152 (Marine Corps Security Force Guard), while instructors can earn 8153 (Marine Corps Security Force Cadre Trainer). History The unit was initially organized as the Marine Detachment, Naval Operation Base in 1920. It was re-designated as Marine Barracks, Norfolk in 1939. During World War II, Marines from the Norfolk Barracks provided security for several commands in the Tidewater area, including the Naval Station, Naval Air Station, and Naval Fuel Annex at Craney Island, and what is now Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek. The Barracks also acted as the processing center for transient Marines on the East Coast. In addition to providing gate security for the Norfolk Naval Base Complex and a security force for a nearby Service Storage Facility, Barracks Marines also served as ceremonial troops and provided security at the headquarters of United States Atlantic Fleet and provided administrative support to Marines stationed in various Naval commands in Norfolk area. The Norfolk Barracks was re-designated as Marine Corps Security Force Battalion, Atlantic, on 1 April 1987, and exercised administrative control over security force companies and detachments afloat in the Atlantic region. FAST (FMF LANT) Marines engaged with 'Intruders' on April 14, 1988 at the fuel farms in Panama during a half hour-long firefight. The former Marine Barracks at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Vallejo, CA was re-designated as Marine Corps Security Force Battalion, Pacific, FMF on 3 August 1987, under Col. R. Johnson, USMC. The battalion exercised administrative control over security force companies and detachments afloat in the Pacific region such as the former Marine Barracks Concord, Marine Barracks Bangor, Marine Barracks Hawaii, Marine Barracks North Island, and Marine Barracks Yokusuka, Japan. Originally, Commanding General, Fleet Marine Force, Pacific had direct operational command of MCSFBN, FMF, Pacific. CG FMF PAC visited the battalion at Mare Island near the end of August that year. The Marine Corps also established FAST Company (Pacific) on 3 August 1987. FAST Marines had participated in the Shallow Hawk 1-87 Riverine Exercise led by US Navy Special Boat Unit-11 a battalion-sanctioned a month earlier in July '87 prior to the official battalion stand-up. The company comprised five 50-man platoons and assumed responsibility for temporary security of U.S. Navy Nuclear Submarine refueling and defueling (RF/DF) sites; reinforcement of US Navy Nuclear Weapons security facilities; security of transportation of special weapons under contingency operations; and US Navy related nuclear accident-incident (i.e. Broken Arrow and Bent Spear) site security; as well as, reinforcement of US Navy Facilities and US Embassies in the Pacific and Indian Ocean AOR. The first and second platoons were trained and commanded by former guard officers and staff NCO's from Marine Barracks Naval Weapons Station Concord, who were already qualified under Navy Technical Proficiency Inspection (NTPI) standard and had several years experience as nuclear weapons couriers. The first operational deployment of a FAST Platoon from MCSFBN (PAC) was 1st Platoon, FAST Company (FMF PAC), on 1 September 1987 to reinforce security at Naval Weapons Station Concord. The second operational deployment of a FAST Platoon from MCSFBN (PAC) was 2nd Platoon, FAST (FMF PAC) to Naval Submarine Base Bremerton Washington in October 1987 for a nuclear fueling security (RF/DF) mission. 1st Platoon also provided RF/DF security for the decommissioning of the USS Seawolf during the fall of 1987 at Mare Island Naval Shipyard. Three of the FAST platoon's also participated in KENNEL LANCE BRAVO anti-terrorism exercises with and against US Navy SEALS at several CONUS Naval Bases in the San Diego and Oakland areas. 1st Platoon, FAST (FMF PAC) also deployed to Naval Station Hawaii during Fall 1988 on an RF/DF mission. Although the FAST companies (FMF LANT and FMF PAC) were established in 1987 to provide a more mobile force under their respective FMF CG's, the battalions were consolidated and re-organized as Marine Corps Security Force Regiment on 16 December 1993. The new regiment assumed control of all security force companies and detachments globally. In 1998, numerous companies and detachments were deactivated due to force reductions and realignments; two FAST companies were established to take their place.

They are capable of special operations, including advanced close quarters battle and in-extremis hostage rescue. Established in 1987, FAST companies provide a limited-duration, expeditionary security force to protect vital naval and national assets. FAST maintains forward-deployed platoons at various naval commands around the globe, and possesses U.S.-based alert forces capable of rapidly responding to unforeseen contingencies worldwide. Each FAST company is equipped and trains with some of the most state-of-the-art weaponry and currently consists of around 500 Marines. FAST companies maintain a high degree of readiness in order to conduct these short- notice, limited-duration contingency operations. The USMC's FAST companies provide both the US Navy and Marine Corps with a dedicated force protection and anti-terrorist unit, and they constitute as one of the USMC Special Operations Capable Forces. History The late 1970s and early 1980s were a high water mark for US military counter-terrorist efforts. A series of deadly attacks directed at Americans highlighted the requirement for security forces capable of countering terrorist threats against military units. The President issued a directive ordering US security agencies and all branches of the military to enhance their capabilities in this field. In compliance with this directive, the USMC conducted a thorough evaluation of its security forces during the mid-eighties. Upon the study's completion, the Corps came to the conclusion that its current security procedures were inadequate to handle the security threats being posed against it. The Corps decided to form a new unit of highly trained Marines dedicated to defending both US Navy and Marine Corps assets from terrorist attack. The new unit was designated as the Fleet Anti- terrorism Security Team, or FAST. Established in 1987, FAST Companies are equipped to perform security missions as directed by the Chief of Naval Operations. FAST Company Marines augment installation security when a threat condition is elevated beyond the ability of resident and auxiliary security forces. They are not designed to provide a permanent security force for the installation. The Marine Corps uses FAST Companies to protect forces when a threat level requires it. Each company is well grounded in basic infantry skills. FAST Companies are primarily designed to conduct defensive combat operations, military security operations, and rear area security operations. They also can be tailored for specific tasks from the Chief of Naval Operations. They also ensure nuclear material on submarines is not compromised when the vessels are docked. *Dedicated, armed, combat-trained cadre *Task organized and equipped to perform security missions of short duration *Augment installation security when the threat condition has been elevated beyond the capability of the permanent security force *Train installation security forces in anti-terrorism and weapons marksmanship *Assist the base security officer in the preparation of base defense and other security plans *Requested by combatant and fleet commanders-in-chief *Deploy only upon approval of the Chief of Naval Operations The Marines of 1st FAST 1st Platoon after raiding a mock embassy in Rota Spain. Since their inception, FAST Company Marines have seen a heavy operations tempo, being deployed to participate in numerous training, security, and combat operations. In 1988, elements of 1st FAST had been deployed to Rodman Naval Station, Panama as a response to a number of incursions by unknown intruders (the intruders were believed to be members of a Cuban special operations unit who were attempting to sabotage US POL stockpiles located on the base ). On alternating with US Army security elements, FAST conducted operations including security patrols around the base perimeter, and establishing ambush positions along known avenues of approach. During one incident in April 1988, a Marine Corporal an 0331 augment from the 2nd Marine Division, was killed by rifle fire during a half-hour long fire- fight with a force of about 30 well-armed intruders, who were suspected to be the Cubans special forces. The FAST Marines were successful in deterring further incursions, and on a number of occasions they took intruders, attempting to gain entry to the base, under fire. On December 21, 1989 the US launched Operation Just Cause, the invasion of Panama. US forces were to secure the country and remove Panamanian military strongman, and the country's de facto leader, from power. Although primarily a US Army, and special operations forces mission, a select number of USMC units were to participate. One of the USMC units selected for the operation was 1st FAST Co. 1st FAST had been operating in Panama for some time providing security at US naval installations; conducting training exercises; and gearing up for any possible terrorist attack directed at USMC or USN facilities in Panama. 1st FAST along with a detachment form the 2nd Light Armored Infantry (LAI) Battalion, another new USMC unit, were to conduct several joint combat missions together. The 2nd LAI det. provided speed, armored protection, and heavy firepower, while 1 FAST provided CQB skills necessary for operating in the tight confines of an urban environment. During Operations Desert Storm and Desert Shield, FAST Marines provided additional security to US naval installations in Bahrain. In January 1991, the US Navy and Marines conducted Operation Sharp Edge, the noncombatant evacuation operation of US and foreign nationals from Liberia. FAST was deployed to relieve the Marine Amphibious Readiness Group that was providing security at the US embassy in Monrovia, Liberia. Shortly after the conclusion of Vigilant Warrior, USCENTCOM found itself involved once again in Somalia, this time to cover the withdrawal of UNOSOM II in accordance with a United Nations decision to pull its forces out of that war ravaged country. After the withdrawal of US forces on 25 March 1994, the United States maintained a liaison office in Mogadishu in an attempt to further the process of political reconciliation in Somalia. Security for this office was provided by a Fleet Anti terrorist Security Team (FAST) platoon. As conditions in Mogadishu deteriorated, the liaison office relocated to Nairobi and the FAST platoon redeployed to Mombasa, Kenya, on 15 September 1994, with FAST redeploying to home station three days later. FAST Platoons also provided security support for the transfer of Cuban migrants from Panama holding areas to Guantanamo Bay during Operation Safe Passage from January to February 1995. Following the 1996 bombing of a USAF barracks in Saudi Arabia, FAST Marines responded. Elements of FAST Company arrived on the scene and secured several buildings within 10 hours. During Operation Fairwinds in late 1996, FAST Platoons provided security for Navy Seabees and USAF Civil Engineers, work sites, camp sites, and convoys in Haiti. Organization There are currently three FAST companies in the US and a training company. Companies A and C are located on Naval Station Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia, and Company B, which is located at Naval Weapons Station Yorktown, Yorktown, Virginia. These companies operate under the control of the Marine Corps Security Force Regiment located on Naval Air Station, Norfolk, Virginia, The Security Force Regiment Training Company is located on Naval Support Activity Hampton Roads, Northwest Annex (NSA Northwest), in Chesapeake, Virginia. Each company includes almost 400 Marines, task-organized based upon mission. Training All Marines assigned to FAST must have completed the following training: *SOI (School of Infantry). *Security Force School - (NSA Northwest, Chesapeake, VA) - Teaches Combat Marksmanship (shotgun and pistol), Close Quarter Battle *FAST Training (5 weeks)-(NSA Northwest, Chesapeake, VA) Additional training in Advanced Urban Combat. During their training exercises, FAST makes extensive use of simulated ammunition or UTM. Si-munition and UTMs are like paintball ammunition, but it can be fired from weapons normally used by the unit instead of plastic guns. The USMC has seen fit to equip its FAST units with a wide array of weapons, and equipment to help them accomplish their mission. The FAST's arsenal is known to include M4 rifles, M4/M-203 40mm grenade launchers, Modified M-14 rifles with specialized stocks to make them Designated Marksmen Rifles (DMR which has a composite stock and fixed magnification scope) or Enhanced Marksmen Rifle (EMR which has a SAGE stock with a specialized scope known as the Scout Sniper Day Scope or SSDS), Beretta M9A1 9mm pistols, Remington 870 shotguns, Benelli M1014 semi automatic shotgun, M-249 5.56mm Squad Automatic Weapons (SAWs), M-240B 7.62mm MMGs, Browning .50 Cal. HMGs, MK-19 40mm HMGs (automatic grenade launchers). All these weapons can at any time be outfitted with the most advanced optics known today like ACOG, EoTech, AimPoint, various PEQ laser systems and night vision scopes. Almost all of FAST Company's missions are unknown, except by the members of that platoon. Charlie FAST Company from NAS Bahrain was sent to secure the embassy in Sanna Yemen in July 2011 just one year prior to the FAST's most recent mission that was known around the world and caught media attention was on 12 September 2012. A FAST team 1 from Rota, Spain was sent to Libya in response to the 2012 U.S. Consulate attack in Benghazi. Recapture Tactics Team The Recapture Tactics Team or RTT specializes in SWAT procedures without having to be military police special reaction team trained, as the two weeks of Army SRT School is not seen as being adequate to their mission profile. RTT units are attached to Nuclear Weapon Stations aboard US naval installations and do not deploy. Where as FAST Platoons deploy to areas in need of naval security operations, RTT has no need to deploy because they are already positioned in the appropriate strategic locations where they are most needed. Marines and Sailors assigned to Naval Nuclear Weapons Stations are given an opportunity, if the Command allows them, to try out for RTT, which is colloquially referred to within the nuclear commands as simply \\"CQB Platoon,\\" or just \\"CQB.\\" Typically, only a small fraction of the Marines and Sailors who are permitted to try out for CQB Platoon are actually selected from the grueling two-week selection process. Those who are selected then have a tactical spin-up (a period of intensive preparatory training), in which the CQB Platoon's current Operators help to get the newly selected candidates ready for the 3rd hardest tactical school in the United States Marine Corps. If they successfully complete spin-up, and an alternate is chosen in one of their places, the RTT candidates then report to USMC CQB School where they undergo an intensive seven-week advanced combat marksmanship and dynamic assault course, during which, in-extreme hostage rescues and counter-nuclear proliferation are heavily emphasized. The Marines and Sailors learn to violently recapture, and take back by force, United States personnel and property that has been stolen or otherwise compromised. If they pass the nearly two-month long USMC CQB school, they have officially earned the 8154 MOS, and they then go back to their Naval Nuclear Weapons Command where they spend several more weeks getting \\"broken in\\" by the platoon as new Operators. Upon successfully completing that phase, the candidates are formally admitted onto the Recapture Tactics Team as Shooters (also more controversially known as \\"Operators.\\") All RTT Shooters must attend the following schools to obtain the appropriate certifications: *United States Marine Corps Recruit Training, viz., Boot Camp - 13 weeks long *Marine Corps School of Infantry, Infantry Training Battalion (SOI-ITB) - 9 weeks long *Basic Security Guard (Marine Corps Security Guard Anti-Terrorism Training) - 7 weeks long *Close Quarter Battle School - 7 weeks long (not including platoon tryouts, spin-ups and the post-Schoolhouse breaking in period.) And are eligible to attend the following courses, pending their command's approval: *Designated Marksman Course *Methods of Entry or MOE, (small unit demolition and door breaching tactics) *High Risk Personnel also known as executive protection, similar to protective services detail, the military version of Federal Law Enforcement Training Center *Inter-service Nonlethal Individual Weapons Instructor Course and other riot control techniques *Helicopter and Rope Suspension Techniques Master Course, aka H.R.S.T., from Special Operations Training Group: This course focuses on how to properly rappel down structures and out of helicopter, fast rope out of helicopter, use Special Purpose Insertion and Extraction SPIE rigging and how to rig these systems to an aircraft with the proper gear for safe tactical operations. However, this is not in the pipeline fashion, as it is with other specialty units. RTT receives the \\"on job training\\" needed after going to CQB school, before going to the other schools listed. Once formally trained in CQB School, they receive the MOS 8154. The Marine Corps Security Forces Regiment's Close Quarters Battle Teams go to various installations as Mobile Training Teams to teach CQB course to units such as but are not limited to: military police special reaction teams, other military branches (both foreign and domestic), and law enforcement organizations (federal, state, and local).

In a variety of fields, artifacts (whether physical or abstract) are created that have both practical functionality and aesthetic affectation. In some cases, aesthetics is primary, and in others, functionality is primary. At best, the two needs are synergistic, in which \\"beauty\\" makes an artifact work better, or in which more functional artifacts are appreciated as aesthetically pleasing. This achievement of form and function, of art and science, of beauty and usefulness, is the primary goal of design, in all of its domains. Architecture and interior design Although structural integrity, cost, the nature of building materials, and the functional utility of the building contribute heavily to the design process, architects can still apply aesthetic considerations to buildings and related architectural structures. Common aesthetic design principles include ornamentation, edge delineation, texture, flow, solemnity, symmetry, color, granularity, the interaction of sunlight and shadows, transcendence, and harmony. These aesthetic considerations form one branch of the philosophy of architecture. Interior designers, being less constrained by structural concerns, have a wider variety of applications to appeal to aesthetics. They may employ color, color harmony, wallpaper, ornamentation, furnishings, fabrics, textures, lighting, various floor treatments, as well as adhere to aesthetic concepts such as feng shui. Digital art A new art form struggling for acceptance is digital art, a by-product of computer programming that raises new questions about what truly constitutes art. Although paralleling many of the aesthetics in traditional media, digital art can additionally draw upon the aesthetic qualities of cross-media tactile relationships; interactivity; autonomous generativity; complexity and interdependence of relationships; suspense; and playfulness. Artists working in this type of art are often forced to justify their use of a computer rather than a traditional medium, leading to, like the debate over Warhol's \\"Brillo Pad Boxes\\", a question of what constitutes art. The criticisms of digital art are many. For example, graphics programs allow perfect shading to be achieved with little to no effort. In other types of programs, there is a sense that because of the variety of tools, filters, distortions, etc., that an artist has a veritable image factory at their disposal. The various criticisms ultimately come down to the issue of \\"what effort is the artist putting into their work?\\" The 3d art community frequently references that while the programs they utilize render and shade the objects, their efforts are more akin to the sculptor or architect, presenting an aesthetically arranged, lighted, and textured scene. The users of the other programs such as Photoshop or Gimp point out that while they may have many tools at their disposal, the art itself must be that much more detailed and imaginative to stand out. In both cases there is the challenge of overcoming the barriers of limited technology and the lack of direct contact with one's medium. Education and social sciences Educators are also interested in how aesthetic designs influence the ways that students think and learn. Some historical figures like John Dewey have approached education through aesthetics. More recently, Elliot Eisner and jan jagodzinski have reopened the debate. Other researchers with postmodern or poststructural influences have done the same, these include Cleo H. Cherryholmes and Michel Foucault. Aesthetics in education has been linked to pragmatism as well as other areas of curriculum development and implementation. See Understanding Curriculum,\\" Chapter 11, Understanding Curriculum as Aesthetic Text, by William F. Pinar, William M. Reynolds, Patrick Slattery and Peter Taubman (1995) for more information. Fashion design Fashion designers use a variety of techniques to allow people to express the truth about their unconscious minds by way of their clothing. To create wearable personality designers use fabric, cut, colour, scale, references to the past, texture, color harmony, distressing, transparency, insignia, accessories, beading and embroidery. It is also used to find the average size of things, to make a product suitable for a high number of customers. Film, television, and video Film combines many diverse disciplines, each of which may have their own rules of aesthetics. The aesthetics of cinematography are closely related to still photography, but the movement of the subject(s), or the camera and the intensities, colors, and placement of the lighting are highly important. Sound recording, editing, and mixing are other, highly important areas of film, often closely related with the musical score. As in Theatre, art direction, in the design of the sets and shooting locations also applies, as well as costume design and makeup. All of these disciplines are closely inter-twined and must be brought together by the aesthetic sensibilities of the director. Montage, or editing is probably the one discipline unique to film, video, and television. The timing, rhythm and progression of shots form the ultimate composition of the film. This procedure is one of the most critical element of post production, and incorporates sound editing and mixing, as well as the design and execution of digital special effects. In the case of a video installation, the method of presentation becomes critical. The work may be screened on a simple monitor, projected on a wall or other surface, or incorporated into a larger sculptural installation. A video installation may also involve sound, with similar considerations to be made based on speaker design and placement, volume, and tone. Gastronomy Although food is a basic and frequently experienced commodity, careful attention to the aesthetic possibilities of foodstuffs can turn eating into gastronomy. Chefs inspire our aesthetic enjoyment through the visual sense using colour and arrangement; they inspire our senses of taste and smell using spices, diversity/contrast, anticipation, seduction, and decoration/garnishes. In regard to drinking water, there are formal criteria for aesthetic value including odour, colour, total dissolved solids and clarity. There are numerical standards in the U.S. for aesthetic acceptability of these parameters. Note, however, a use of a word translated to \\"culinary\\" in Adorno's aesthetics. Adorno distinguishes between technically accurate and \\"beautiful\\" musical interpretation, and an interpretation higher which brings out the \\"truth\\" in the musical text: interpretations more rehearsed, with more time for rehearsal, but which might sound strange to audiences pandered-to by popular conductors (perhaps in the way Glenn Gould enstranges the music of Beethoven). Unfortunately for the ordinary reader of Adorno, this isn't something technical such as \\"original instruments\\". It is instead the work of art that doesn't pander to what the audience \\"wants\\"...its whims. This is linked to a Marxist interpretation which instead of treating the audience as an all-powerful \\"customer\\" adopts a teacherly or even priestly stance \\"above\\" the mere audience, something only the most \\"snobbish\\" of French chefs would dare, proposing to teach it to like Higher Things. There are rarefied forms of *haute*cuisine; but note that common sense usually has a horselaugh about precious Yuppies eating designer food which it withholds about concert-goers listening to Berg; your man in the street merely thinks the latter crowd to be odd jobs, and doesn't resent them, meaning that ethical judgements play a role in aesthetic judgements that specialists in ethics, and specialists in aesthetics, systematically disregard...but which artists such as Tolstoy regarded as central. Based on Adorno's theory of the (merely) culinary as not being \\"art\\", this would seem to mean that it is a joke, for an Adornoite (if such a person exists meaningfully), to treat cooking as an art form or eating as art appreciation. Monty Python would often reverberate with this sort of arcana in a strange way: in the Mr. Creosote passage of The Meaning of Life, an enormously fat man is persuaded by the fawning waiter to have one more sweet whereupon Mr. Creosote throws up all over the dining room. Note that the scene has more claims to be art, despite being nauseating, than designer food. This MAY be an unconscious comment on any theory of art that blindly equates \\"fine dining\\" and a visit to the picture galleries, a sort of tourist equation in which picture galleries are overrun in fact by post-prandial Mr. Creosotes. Even the ordinary man in the street would say that the starving artist visiting the gallery has a \\"better\\" apprehension of the higher, more inner, more elusive aura of the art work than Mr. Creosote, which means that for some authors, including Adorno, there is a nexus between ethics (which nearly tracks aesthetics polyphonically, where we use \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" in ethics to characterise people and their deeds, and in aesthetics to judge what to buy). The possibility of a rejection of the culinary in art starts with Kant's theory of the sublime but does not end there; post Holocaust (with its Nazis playing Bach: with Adorno's questions about poetry after Auschwitz) the culinary, and whether the German officer enjoying a \\"fine\\" meal has much of anything to do with art, become important aesthetic questions. A Marxist theory of art would probably conclude that the chef cannot be an artist, lacking autonomy and beholden to the customer, Mr. Creosote, in all regards. Humor There is a developed theory of the aesthetics of jokes and humor, including a mathematical and logical analysis. Industrial design Industrial Design: Designers need many aesthetic qualities to improve the marketability of manufactured products: smoothness, shininess/reflectivity, texture, pattern, curviness, color, simplicity, usability, velocity, symmetry, naturalness, and modernism. The staff of the Design Aesthetics section focuses on design, appearance and the way people perceive products. Design aesthetics is interested in the appearance of products; the explanation and meaning of this appearance is studied mainly in terms of social and cultural factors. The distinctive focus of the section is research and education in the field of sensory modalities in relation to product design. These fields of attention generate design baggage that enables engineers to design products, systems, and services, and match them to the correct field of use. Information technology Aesthetics in information technology has focused upon the study of human-computer interaction and creating user-friendly devices and software applications. Software itself has aesthetic dimensions (\\"software aesthetics\\"), as do information-technology-mediated processes and experiences such as computer video games and virtual reality simulations. Digital culture is a distinct aesthetic to judge the appeal of digital environments such as Web browsers, websites, and icons, as well as visual and aural art produced exclusively with digital technologies. The notion of cyberspace has sometimes been linked to the concept of the sublime. Aesthetics in information technology do also apply to the act of designing software itself. Numerous programmers profess to experiencing a dimension of elegance in the functionality and structuring of software at the source code level.Preface to the First Edition For example, a short, powerful expression that clearly expresses the intent of the code can be considered \\"beautiful\\" to the poor programmer charged with maintaining said code. This contrasts with code that is (as code all too often is) short, cryptic, unclear, and unnecessarily \\"clever\\". In-line documentation, while not strictly code, can be considered something a programmer would need to be good at in order to write beautiful code. Correctly done, documentation can accentuate the effect of beautiful code, when it is clear, concise, explains the intent of the programmer, and expands the understanding that one can gain by simply looking at the code. Comments that are redundant (only explain what the code already explains), cryptic, and overly long or short can detract from beautiful code. Aesthetics in programming can also have a practical level: Under the right conditions, elegant code can run faster and more efficiently, and (most importantly) be less prone to errors.Donald Knuth, \\"Literate Programming\\", http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf Critics of this would say that the need to justify \\"good design\\" by reference to \\"cost savings\\" means that \\"good design\\" isn't \\"art\\" insofar as art is autonomous, and many aestheticians would have to say that art emerges in applications only in excess of cost savings. In information technology, theorists of \\"user friendliness\\" have to justify their \\"user friendly\\" applications and often disregard basic statistics when most users like a system, but a significant minority hate it. That is, they may discard the standard deviation of their data in order to sell a good design for the best price, and this has nothing to do with art insofar as art is a useful signifier (if you cost-justify everything you are a businessman and not an artist). A folk phenomenon among real programmers is in fact their frequent hatred of practice described in books as best practice and good design. A Marxist theory of industrial \\"art\\" would ascribe this to alienation, in which subaltern programmers never produce code they own in any meaningful sense, with the problem that the same sort of alienation, soldiering, and bloody-mindedness appeared, it seems, in Soviet computing shops. The most sophisticated writings on the topic of aesthetics are to be found in the late Edsger Wybe Dijkstra's corpus of papers and notes on computing: in Dijkstra, the art is real, but Ying with respect to the Yang of applications; Dijkstra seemed to have refused any analysis of programming as other than applied mathematics and, strange to say, never pursued what Adorno (the midcentury theoretician of whom Dijkstra was apparently unaware) called a purely culinary elegance...despite the protests of others that his work was \\"hard to digest\\", in Adorno's words not very culinary. Dijkstra's beauty refused the notion of accessibility as do many \\"artistic\\" works ancient and modern: it was hard as is the Grosse Fuge, Beethoven's syncopated and neo- primitive late movement. In fact, no aesthetician makes \\"user friendliness\\" canonical and necessary in a work of art, strange to say in an era when supposedly the masses rule through the market; for most art theorists, it is nice if the canaille can enjoy some pretty rondo of Mozart and whistle it on the street, but would deny that this property must be shared by the Masonic prelude and fugue or the Requiem mass. This makes strange any claim that a programmer making his work \\"user friendly\\" to all comers is some sort of artist by virtue of that. For Dijsktra, truth was primary, and beauty the automatic result. Landscape design Landscape designers draw upon design elements such as axis, line, landform, horizontal and vertical planes, texture, and scale to create aesthetic variation within the landscape. They may additionally make use of aesthetic elements such as pools or fountains of water, plants, seasonal variance, stonework, fragrance, exterior lighting, statues, and lawns. Literature In poetry, short stories, novels and non- fiction, authors use a variety of techniques to appeal to our aesthetic values. Depending on the type of writing an author may employ rhythm, illustrations, structure, time shifting, juxtaposition, dualism, imagery, fantasy, suspense, analysis, humor/cynicism, and thinking aloud. Cartography/Map Design Aesthetics in cartography relates to the visual experience of map reading and can take two forms: affective responses to the map itself as an aesthetic object (e.g., considering a map to be \\"beautiful,\\" or \\"interesting,\\" or \\"frustrating\\"), and affective responses to the geographic subject of the map (e.g., considering the mapped landscape as \\"beautiful\\" or \\"someplace I want to visit\\").Robinson, A. (1952). The Look of Maps. University of Wisconsin Press. Like other forms of design, almost all maps are created to serve a practical purpose: to inform, to explain, to discover, to guide, to convince. To some, aesthetics may seem of secondary concern, especially in the era of Geographic information systems and web mapping, when maps are created by the millions every day, to be used temporarily then discarded. However, it still serves an important, even practical purpose. Map readers are more likely to pick up a beautiful map than an ugly one, and are likely to spend more time using a map that is pleasing to look at. In turn, there is an aesthetic appeal for maps that look authoritative, clear, and well-crafted.Nestel, C. (2019). Aesthetics and Design. The Geographic Information Science & Technology Body of Knowledge (1st Quarter 2019 Edition), John P. Wilson (Ed.). DOI: 10.22224/gistbok/2019.4.14 Consequently, products such as Google Maps have undergone multiple major revisions to their design to make them not only more accurate and more useful, but more attractive, and thus more competitive.Google Maps History, Version Museum. 2018. Willem Van Lancker, Google Maps: Designing the Modern Atlas, Core77. Cartographers make aesthetic judgments when designing maps to ensure that the content forms a clear expression of the theme(s). Antique maps are perhaps especially revered due to their aesthetic value, which may seem to be derived from their styles of ornamentation. As such, aesthetics are often wrongly considered to be a by- product of design. If it is taken that aesthetic judgments are produced within a certain social context, they are fundamental to the cartographer's symbolisation and as such are integral to the function of maps. Marketing As opposed to Industrial Design, which focuses on the aesthetic qualities of consumer products (see below), the use of aesthetics in marketing concerns itself with the \\"trade dress\\" of a product, such as its branding, its commercial representation, or the reputation of its producer. Marketing professionals may tickle the consumer's aesthetic appreciation of sassyness, sophistication, color-harmony, stylishness, catchy jingles, slogans, craftsmanship, soothingness, attentiveness, authenticity, or the related perceived experiences associated with product consumption. Marketing consists of intriguing the human mind to think in a direction where it would not have done so previously ‚Äì or not without outside input. Human curiosity, self gain or mental adjustment is what drives marketing development itself. Mathematics The aesthetics of mathematics are often compared with music and poetry. Hungarian mathematician Paul Erd≈ës expressed his views on the indescribable beauty of mathematics when he said \\"Why are numbers beautiful? It's like asking why is Beethoven's Ninth Symphony beautiful.\\" Math appeals to the \\"senses\\" of logic, order, novelty, elegance, and discovery. Some concepts in math with specific aesthetic application include sacred ratios in geometry, the intuitiveness of axioms, the complexity and intrigue of fractals, the solidness and regularity of polyhedra, and the serendipity of relating theorems across disciplines. There is a developed aesthetic and theory of humor in mathematical humor. Music Some of the aesthetic elements expressed in music include lyricism, harmony, hypnotism, emotiveness, temporal dynamics, volume dynamics, resonance, playfulness, color, subtlety, elatedness, depth, and mood (see musical development). Aesthetics in music are often believed to be highly sensitive to their context: what sounds good in modern rock music might sound terrible in the context of the early baroque age. Neuroesthetics Cognitive science has also considered aesthetics, with the advent of neuroesthetics, pioneered by Semir Zeki, which seeks to explain the prominence of great art as an embodiment of biological principles of the brain, namely that great works of art capture the essence of things just as vision and the brain capture the essentials of the world from the ever- changing stream of sensory input. See also Vogelkop bowerbird. Performing arts Performing arts appeal to our aesthetics of storytelling, grace, balance, class, timing, strength, shock, humor, costume, irony, beauty, drama, suspense, and sensuality. Whereas live stage performance is usually constrained by the physical reality at hand, film performance can further add the aesthetic elements of large-scale action, fantasy, and a complex interwoven musical score. Performance art often consciously mixes the aesthetics of several forms. Role-playing games are sometimes seen as a performing art with an aesthetic structure of their own, called RPG theory. Two-dimensional and plastic arts Aesthetic considerations within the visual arts are usually associated with the sense of vision. A painting or sculpture, however, is also perceived spatially by recognized associations and context, and even to some extent by the senses of smell, hearing, and touch. The form of the work can be subject to an aesthetic as much as the content. In painting, the aesthetic convention that we see a three-dimensional representation rather than a two-dimensional canvas is so well understood that most people do not realize that they are making an aesthetic interpretation. This notion is the basis of abstract impressionism. In the United States during the postwar period, the \\"push-pull\\" theories of Hans Hofmann, positing a relation between color and perceived depth, strongly influenced a generation of prominent abstract painters, many of whom studied under Hofmann and were generally associated with abstract expressionism. Hofmann's general attitude toward abstraction as virtually a moral imperative for the serious painter was also extremely influential. Some aesthetic effects available in visual arts include variation, juxtaposition, repetition, field effects, symmetry/asymmetry, perceived mass, subliminal structure, linear dynamics, tension and repose, pattern, contrast, perspective, 3 dimensionality, movement, rhythm, unity/Gestalt, matrixiality and proportion. Urban life Towns and cities have been planned with aesthetics in mind; here in Bristol (England), 19th century private sector development was designed to appear attractive. Over half of mankind lives in cities; although it represents a lofty goal, planning and achieving urban aesthetics (beautification) involves a good deal of historical luck, happenstance, and indirect gestalt. Nevertheless, aesthetically pleasing cities share certain traits: ethnic and cultural variety, numerous microclimates that promote a diversity of vegetation, sufficient public transportation, Public art and freedom of expression in the community in the forms of sculpture, graffiti and street art, a range of build-out (or zoning) that creates both densely and sparsely populated areas, scenic neighboring geography (oceans or mountains), public spaces and events such as parks and parades, musical variety through local radio or street musicians, and enforcement of laws that abate noise, crime, and pollution. Website design Recent research suggests that the visual aesthetics of computer interface is a strong determinant of users‚Äô satisfaction and pleasure. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses found that users‚Äô perceptions consist of different main dimensions. Lavie and Tractinsky found two main dimension which they termed ‚Äúclassical aesthetics‚Äù and ‚Äúexpressive aesthetics‚Äù.Lavie, T., & Tractinsky, N. (2004). Assessing Dimensions of Perceived Visual Aesthetics of Websites. International Journal of Human Computer Studies , 269-298. *Classical Aesthetics ‚Äì pertains to aesthetic notions that presided from antiquity until the 18th century. These notions emphasize orderly and clear design and are closely related to many of the design rules advocated by usability experts. *Expressive Aesthetics ‚Äì created by the designers‚Äô creativity and originality and by the ability to break design conventions. While both dimensions of perceived aesthetic are drawn from a pool of aesthetic judgments, they are clearly distinguishable from each other. In a recent study Moshagen and Thielsch found four core dimensions of website aesthetics:Moshagen, M. & Thielsch, M. T. (2010). Facets of visual aesthetics. In: International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 68 (10), 689‚Äì709. *Simplicity *Diversity *Colors *Craftsmanship Simplicity and diversity have repeatedly been treated as formal parameters of aesthetic objects throughout the history of empirical aesthetics. Colors are a very critical property of aesthetic objects. Craftsmanship addresses the skillful and coherent integration of the relevant design dimensions. While simplicity is highly correlated to classical aesthetics as mentioned by Lavie and Tractinsky, the other three factors could be treated as deeper differentiation of expressive aesthetics. Best practices for aesthetic website design *Create visual clues based on groupings; related items or links are grouped together while unrelated items are separated. *Use headings and subheadings to allow visual scanning of content. *Use headings, subheadings, font sizes, bold fonts and italic fonts in proportion to the importance of the item. *Align elements on a page so that they are all visually connected; size all elements on the page to create balance and unity; nothing should look out of place unless you have a specific reason for the effect. *Choose a font style that supports the site atmosphere and stick to it; limit styles to 2 at the most. *Use images and photos for visual appeal and to communicate ideas. *Use one set of design elements across your website. Website design aesthetics and credibility Website design influences user's perception of site credibility. One of the factors that influences whether users stay or go on a web page is the page aesthetics. Another reason may involve a user's judgment about the site's credibility. Findings indicate that when the same content is presented using different levels of aesthetic treatment, the content with a higher aesthetic treatment was judged as having higher credibility. We call this the amelioration effect of visual design and aesthetics on content credibility. Holmes suggests that this effect is operational within the first few seconds in which a user views a web page. Given the same content, a higher aesthetic treatment will increase perceived credibility.Holmes, J., & Robins, D. (2008). Aesthetics and Credibility in Web Site Design.

The parish is bounded by the River Ock to the north, by two tributaries of the Ock to the south (Childrey Brook and Nor Brook), and by field boundaries and the road between Kingston Bagpuize and West Hanney to the west. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 229. Archaeology The course of a Roman road passes through the parish about east of the village. Manor Garford's toponym evolved from Garanford in the 10th century to Wareford in the 11th century before reaching its current form. In AD 940 Edmund I gave 15 houses at Garford to his thegn Wulfric, and in 960 Edmund's son Edgar the Peaceful confirmed the grant. The Benedictine Abingdon Abbey held two hides of land at Garford by the time of the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. Apart from brief interruptions during the reign of William II the Abbey retained Garford until 1538, when it surrendered its lands to the Crown in the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Elizabeth I sold Garford in 1576, after which it changed hands a number of times. In 1624 Garford was bought jointly by Elizabeth Craven (n√©e Whitmore), widow of William Craven, by Sir William Whitmore and by Elizabeth's son Thomas Craven. By the time of the English Civil War Garford was among the estates of William, Baron Craven, who supported the Royalists. When the Parliamentarians won the civil war the Commonwealth of England's treason trustees confiscated all of the Baron's estates. After the restoration of the English monarchy Craven's estates were restored to him and in 1664 he was created 1st Earl of Craven. Garford remained among the estates of the Barons Craven until 1821, when it was sold by another William Craven, 1st Earl of Craven. Chapel Since at least the 13th century, Garford has been part of the ancient ecclesiastical parish of Marcham. The Church of England chapel of Saint Luke dates from the 13th century, but was largely rebuilt in 1880 by Gothic Revival architect Edwin Dolby. The east window of the chancel is a pair of 13th-century lancets and the south doorway of the nave is also largely 13th century. There is a 14th- or 15th-century window in the south wall of the nave, and a 16th- or 17th-century window on the south side of the chancel. The chapel's other windows are largely Victorian. The ancient windows seem to occupy roughly the same positions in the rebuilt chapel as they did in the original building. There is a wooden bell-turret with one bell. Economic history Venn Mill, built about 1800 The Domesday Book records that by 1086 Garford had a watermill. There is a record of Garford having a watermill in the 16th century. The present Venn Mill, on Childrey Brook where the Roman road between Besselsleigh and Wantage crosses the stream, was built in about 1800 but may occupy the same site as the ancient mill. It is in full working order but for insurance reasons is open to the public only occasionally. Under an Act of Parliament of 1771, the Besselsleigh Turnpike Trust took over management of the road between Hungerford and Wantage and the Roman road between Wantage and Besselsleigh. The road ceased to be a turnpike in 1878. An open field system of farming prevailed in the parish until the beginning of the 19th century. Unusually, Parliament passed two Inclosure Acts for Garford: the first taking effect in 1814‚Äì15 and the second being passed in 1825.

The term has been in use since at least the early 18th century. At least 55,000 women and girls worked as bal maidens, and the actual number is likely to have been much higher. While women worked in coal mines elsewhere in Britain, either on the surface or underground, bal maidens worked only on the surface. It is likely that Cornish women had worked in metal mining since antiquity, but the first records of female mine workers date from the 13th century. After the Black Death in the 14th century, mining declined, and no records of female workers have been found from then until the late 17th century. Industrial improvements, the end of Crown control of metal mines, and rising demand for raw materials caused a boom in Cornish mining in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Increasing numbers of women and girls were recruited to the mines from about 1720, processing ore sent up by the male miners underground. The discovery of cheaper sources of copper in North Wales in the 1770s triggered a crash in the copper price, and many mines closed. As the Industrial Revolution began in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the Welsh metal mines declined and mining in Cornwall and Devon became viable once more. Women and girls were recruited in large numbers for work in ore processing. Women and children accounted for up to half the workers in the area's copper mines. Although machinery was capable of performing much of the work done by bal maidens, the industry grew so quickly that the number of women and girls working grew steadily even though their numbers fell as a proportion of the workforce to 15‚Äì20% by 1850. At the peak of the Cornish mining boom, in around 1860, at least 6000 bal maidens were working at the region's mines; the actual number is likely to have been much higher. While it was not unusual for girls to become bal maidens at the age of six and to work into old age, they generally began at around age 10 or 11 and left work once they married. From the 1860s Cornish mines faced competition from cheap metal imports, and legislation introduced in the 1870s limited the use of child labour. The Cornish mining system went into terminal decline, leading to a collapse of the local economy and mass emigration both overseas and to other parts of the United Kingdom. In 1891 the number of bal maidens had fallen to half its peak, and by the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 very few remained in employment. In 1921 Dolcoath mine, the last employer of bal maidens, ceased operations, bringing the tradition to an end. Other than women recruited for ore processing at Geevor as a result of labour shortages during the Second World War, and a very limited number of female workers after the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 banned the practice of recruiting only male mineworkers, women never again performed manual labour in Cornish mines. The last surviving bal maiden died in 1968, and with the closure of South Crofty tin mine in 1998, Cornish metals mining came to an end.  Background  Minions left by tin-streaming (gathering clusters of ore from stream and river beds), the earliest form of mining in Cornwallalt=Soil mounds piled near the course of a small stream For at least 3,000 years from antiquity until the late 20th century mining of tin and copper played a significant part in the economy of Cornwall. Cornwall, the northern part of Iberia and the Ore Mountains (the modern border between the Czech Republic and Germany) are the only places in Europe in which major tin deposits are found near the surface. As tin is an essential ingredient of bronze, Cornwall was of great economic significance in Bronze Age Europe despite its relative isolation. Mining by the Roman Empire led to the Iberian mines becoming depleted by the 3rd century AD, leaving Cornwall and neighbouring Devon the most significant sources of tin in Europe. While it appears from surviving evidence that after the decline of the Bronze Age civilisations copper production ceased in Cornwall, it seems that the tin mines were in continuous operation throughout the Roman period and the Middle Ages. The primitive early mines of Cornwall and Devon probably were operated by local extended families, with the men, women and children all working. Men and boys probably worked both above the surface and below ground, and women and girls worked only above ground; there is no archaeological evidence for women and children working underground in Bronze Age Britain, although some mines from the period contain tunnels so small that only children or very short adults could have worked in them. At some point between the death of Cnut the Great in 1035 and the death of Edward the Confessor in early 1066, the independent Kingdom of Cornwall was annexed by the neighbouring Kingdom of Wessex, a part of the Kingdom of England. In late 1066 Cornwall, along with the rest of the lands under the control of the English king, was conquered by the Normans and came under the control of William the Conqueror. By the late 12th century the metal mines were brought under the control of the Crown; operation of the tin mines was devolved to the Lord Warden of the Stannaries, and mining of other metals was directly controlled by the Crown as Mines Royal.  Female mine workers in the Middle Ages  Although women and girls probably worked in mining since antiquity, the earliest known written references to female manual labourers in mining are in the 13th and 14th century records of the royal lead and silver mines at Bere Alston, on the border between Devon and Cornwall. The mines were bordered on three sides by a loop of the River Tamar, since 936 the traditional boundary between Devon and Cornwall. The mines themselves were on the Devon side of the border at Bere Alston itself, but the surface-level smelters were on the Cornish side at Calstock as there was a readier supply of timber for use in the furnaces. Although the mining itself was carried out by men, female workers were employed to sort ore for crushing, to prepare the bone ash used as a flux during the smelting process, and for general manual labour. An adult woman was paid up to one penny per day, and young girls between and of a penny. Miners and other skilled labourers at Bere Alston were recruited from throughout England and Wales, and from the evidence of surnames in the records it appears that many of the female labourers were the wives and daughters of these incomers rather than locally recruited women. During and after the Black Death the area's population collapsed. Those miners who had survived the pandemic left mining to work in farming, in which wages had doubled owing to the severe labour shortage, and the mines of Bere Alston were abandoned. Although women and girls were almost certainly employed at the lead and silver mine at Bere Alston, and also a few records have so far been of female workers at tin works on Bodmin Moor and around Redruth and Marazion in the 14th century. It does not appear that significant numbers of female labourers worked in Cornwall's mining industry until the early 18th century, as no records have yet been discovered for this period.  Mechanisation and the 18th century copper boom  In 1678 Clement Clerke introduced the coal-powered reverberatory furnace, greatly increasing the quantity of metal extractable from ore. The Mines Royal Act 1689 ended Crown ownership of Cornwall's mines, allowing private investors and local families to begin mining operations. At the same time, the Nine Years' War (1688‚Äì97) and the War of the Spanish Succession (1701‚Äì14) caused high demand for metals. As a consequence the Midlands, with easy river and canal access to the coal mines of Wales and northern England and to the metal mines of Cornwall, became a major centre for metallurgy. Ore was shipped from Cornwall up the River Severn to smelters in Gloucestershire where it was refined and sold on to the factories surrounding Birmingham. Financiers and entrepreneurs began investing in and reorganising the mines of Cornwall. With a shortage of manual labour in rural and lightly-populated Cornwall, and with a prevalent belief that women and children were best suited to ore separation (which required dexterity and good observation skills but little in the way of physical strength), the large-scale recruitment of women and girls to the mines began. It is around this time that the term \\"bal maiden\\" appears to have come into common usage, derived from the Old Cornish (mine). A significant proportion of Cornwall's young women quickly became involved in mining; by 1736 the vicar of Ludgvan was complaining that he was unable to hire servants as the young women of the town were \\"employed about copper\\". In around 1720, two key innovations revolutionised the Cornish mining industry. The whim, a horse-powered mechanism for lifting ore to the surface, made mining in deep shafts practical, and the horse-powered pump allowed mining beneath the water table.  Role of 18th century bal maidens  With the need for expensive machinery and horses and for large numbers of workers at each mine, the traditional operation of mines by extended families or by individual entrepreneurs became impractical, and the new deep-level mines came under the ownership of groups of investors and of mining companies. A group of people known as a \\"tribute team\\" (often a single extended family) would bid for the right to work a specified portion of the mine; the men and older boys would dig in the appointed section, and the women, girls and young boys would dress the ore sent up by the men. In later years the practice of bal maidens dressing only the ore sent up by the men of their tribute team was abandoned, and they would instead be paid a flat wage by the mine owner to dress any ore sent up, and the tribute team which had sent up the ore would be billed for the work done. Typical work for a bal maiden in this period was picking ore from rubble, breaking and separating the ore, and carrying ore and metal. Generally girls under 12 would sort the ore, older girls would separate the ore, and grown women would carry out the heavy manual labour of breaking rocks with hammers and of transporting ore between various pieces of apparatus. As the bal maidens of the smaller tribute teams often did not have the time to dress all the ore sent up, or it was not financially worthwhile to pay for the poorer quality ore to be processed, large quantities of poor quality ore were discarded unprocessed in waste heaps. On those occasions when improved extraction techniques or rises in the price of metals made it worthwhile to process this discarded ore, sometimes separate tribute teams would bid for the right to dress and process this rubble. As the practice of using tribute teams declined in the early 19th century, the mine owners themselves would hire bal maidens to dress this waste ore. Records from the Pool Adit copper mine at Trevenson (the most successful of the early copper mines) show in 1729, 25 bal maidens and three males worked as 'pickers' sorting high quality from poor quality ore, earning a flat rate of 4d per day and typically working 20 days per month. (Records do not show the ages of the pickers at Pool Adit, but the male pickers are likely to have been boys too young for heavy labour.) In 1730 Pool Adit employed 30 female and four male pickers, and by 1731 the figures had risen to 55 female and five male, typically working 22 to 26 days per month. The number of bal maidens employed in the industry rose dramatically, and by the early 1770s Dolcoath, by then the most significant of the Cornish copper mines, employed around 220 bal maidens on the copper dressing floors alone. It appears that during the 18th century copper boom, it was customary throughout the Cornish mining industry to use bal maidens purely as casual labour. There are no records of bal maidens being contracted to a particular mine or paid a piece-rate for the amount of work done. Instead, mine accounts invariably show them being paid a fixed daily rate and employed only as and when they were needed. When poor weather conditions made surface-level work impossible, water shortages meant water-powered machinery could not operate, or accidents in the mines caused a temporary closure, the bal maidens would be suspended. In the 1770s and 1780s the discovery of copper at Parys Mountain in Anglesey which could be cheaply extracted by opencast mining led to a crash in the copper price, and expensive deep mining began to become unviable. As the copper boom came to an end, the mines began to close. In 1788 mining ceased at Dolcoath itself, although some bal maidens continued to be employed picking through the large quantities of ore which had already been brought to the surface.  Industrialisation and the 19th century copper boom  At the end of the 18th century the copper mining industry of North Wales centred around Parys Mountain declined, and the depression in the British copper market ended. As the price rose, the Cornish mines began to reopen. By this time, the Industrial Revolution had begun, bringing with it new attitudes towards organisation and efficiency. While the mine managers of the 18th century generally treated bal maidens as useful only for breaking and sorting ore, the managers of these new mines sought to use all their employees as efficiently as possible. While 18th century metal mines had worked on the principle of adult men digging the ore and women and children picking and cobbing the ore ready for smelting, in the new large-scale mines of the early 19th century working practices changed. The strenuous underground work was still carried out by male workers, as was breaking large rocks with heavy hammers ('ragging'). In copper mines, very young girls, and sick and injured older women, carried out the simple work of picking. Girls in their late teens forced the broken ore through a broad mesh to sort the ore ('riddling'), and used hammers to break the large chunks of ore left by the riddling process into smaller chunks. Girls in their mid-teens cobbed the resulting chunks, separating the valuable ore from waste rock. Grown women would carry out the heavy manual labour of breaking rocks with hammers ('spalling'), of crushing sorted ore to small grains ready for smelting ('bucking') and of transporting ore between various pieces of apparatus. An experienced bal maiden working as a spaller would produce approximately one ton (2240 lb; 1016 kg) of broken ore per day, depending on the type of stone. In the tin mines, in which ore could be crushed far more finely than copper before smelting, cobbing and bucking did not take place. Instead, the chunks of spalled ore were mechanically stamped to fine grains, and washed into a series of collecting pits to separate the coarse 'rough' from the fine 'slimes'. The resulting rough and slimes were separated out on large wooden frames ('buddling' and 'framing' respectively), to extract the tin ore from the surrounding dust and grit. Following the introduction of the mechanical ore crusher in 1804 the tasks traditionally carried out by bal maidens began to be mechanised. Despite this, the rapid growth of the mines in comparison to the slow spread of mechanisation meant the number of bal maidens appears to have risen steadily, although statistics for the number of women employed in the mines in the early days of industrialisation are incomplete and a few are contradictory.  Total numbers  Because records from the period are incomplete and inconsistent in format, the total number of bal maidens working in this period is unclear. Estimates for the total number employed at the end of the 18th century range from 1,200 to 5,000, with women and children constituting up to half the total number of people working in copper mining and a lower proportion in the less labour-intensive tin mining. Mayers (2008) estimates that at a minimum 55,000 women and girls in total worked as bal maidens between 1720 and 1921, based on an estimate of each working an average of 10 years, with the number peaking in the early 1860s at at least 7,000. The actual figures are likely to have been considerably higher; not all mines recorded male and female workers separately, and after 1872 there may have been deliberate under-reporting of the number of children working, owing to legal restrictions on their employment. These estimates do not include female workers performing non-manual administrative work at the mines, nor those in related industries such as slate and quarrying. Although the proportion of bal maidens in the workforce fell steadily, the mining boom of the first half of the 19th century took the total number to between 4,000 and 14,400 by the 1840s. The 1841 Census (the first full census of England) shows 3,250 women working in the mines, but the mine returns of the same year show over 5,000 women in the tin, lead and copper mines of Cornwall and West Devon. Increased mechanisation of the ore dressing process and public concerns over subjecting women and children to the harsh working conditions of the mines meant that the proportion of bal maidens in the workforce continued to fall, and it is generally accepted that by 1850 between 15 and 20% of mine workers were female. By the 1861 census, coinciding with the peak of the Cornish mining industry, a minimum of 6,000 women were working in mining in Cornwall, at least 2,500 of whom worked within a five-mile radius of Camborne. Although employed primarily in copper and tin mines, bal maidens also worked in lead, zinc, manganese, iron, antimony, wolfram, and uranium mines, and in slate and china clay quarries.  Typical work  alt=Three women wearing heavy clothing and long bonnets, carrying long hammers, standing around a pile of rocks Women typically began working at the mines at around the age of 10 or 11, although there are some cases of girls starting work at as young as six, and in areas such as Camborne with a high demand for workers it was not unusual for girls to start work at age seven or eight. (Charles Foster Barham's enquiry of 1841 found an average age for starting work of 12.) Until the 1870s Cornwall was largely unaffected by legislation which limited child labour in mines elsewhere in the United Kingdom, and the typical ages of bal maidens remained virtually unchanged between the 1841 census and the 1871 census. Women would typically remain at the mine until they married; while this generally meant that they stopped working at between the ages of 19 and 24, it was not unusual for unmarried women and widows to continue working into their 60s and 70s; and a 93-year-old bal maiden was recorded in the 1891 census. A typical working day would last from 7.00 am to 5.00 pm in summer and from dawn to dusk in winter, (ore dressing by candle-light was not cost effective) with a lunch break of either half an hour or an hour at noon. Lunch typically consisted of pasties, hoggans (hard pasties made with unleavened barley flour and filled with pork, potato or dried fruit) or fish eaten cold or warmed in ovens attached to the mine's furnaces, along with mugwort or pennyroyal tea, and it was not usual even for workers who lived near their workplace to go home for meals. Although still not paid on a piece-rate basis, each bal maiden would be expected to meet a daily quota to earn her pay; some mines operated on the basis that once the quota had been met the bal maidens were allowed to go home, meaning the working day could finish up to two hours early. Although at a few tin mines at which water-powered machinery was in continuous operation bal maidens would work seven days a week, in the vast majority of the industry they were not expected to work on Sundays. As well as the religious holidays observed in the rest of the United Kingdom, Cornish miners also celebrated St Piran's Day (5 March) and Chewidden Thursday (the Thursday before Christmas), purportedly the day on which St Piran rediscovered tin-smelting. Other than religious holidays and parish feast days, Cornish miners had no holidays until labour reforms in the early 20th century. Typical pay in the 1840s and 1850s would be 4d per day for younger girls, rising to 8d‚Äì1s per day for full-grown women engaged in skilled bucking work. (Wages varied by region owing to differing levels of supply and demand for workers; in Kea and Wendron the average wage for women and girls was as high as 18s in 1841.) As they were employed as casual labour, bal maidens were not tied to any particular mine, and it was not unusual for them to transfer to other mines offering better pay or conditions. Some mines may have paid a monthly loyalty bonus in an effort to retain their workers. The workers could be fined for bad language, failure to work hard enough, absenteeism and other misdemeanours. As their pay was dependent on the profitability of the mine, it was not unusual early in the 19th century for bal maidens to work for long periods (in at least one case, a laundry woman, 11 months) without pay, and to receive their pay in arrears once the mine returned to profit. While some younger bal maidens would attend school before starting work and, in 1841, around a quarter of bal maidens attended Sunday schools, illiteracy was rife. When Charles Foster Barham's reported to the 1842 Royal Commission into the Employment of Children at the Mines he found that less than half of bal maidens he interviewed were able to read to any extent. Some mines subsidised basic education for the children of their employees. Mining families generally valued education so highly that they would often try to send at least one child to school, but any education children did receive tended to be curtailed once they became old enough to work in the mines. Unlike the coal mines of Wales and northern England, the Cornish mines generally did not provide housing for their workers, largely owing to the casual nature of work under the tribute team system. Bal maidens would typically travel to the mines from their family homes, some families building homes near the mine. (Until the Inclosure Acts of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, anyone moving to an area had the right to build a house on common land, provided they could build it overnight.) They would generally remain living with their families until marriage. (Much of early 19th century Cornwall retained the old custom of 'keeping company', by which a couple would not be formally married until the woman became pregnant, and the woman would continue to work and to live with her family until that time.) While some lived at or near the mine at which they worked, mine workers typically walked three to four miles (five to seven km) to and from work each day. The miners' cottages were generally crowded and squalid, sometimes with ten or more people living in each small cottage, while the abstraction of the region's water supplies for use in the mines led to serious problems with sanitation and the provision of fresh water. During the European food crisis of the 1840s, food prices rose sharply to around three times the pre-crisis prices, and the relatively low-paid bal maidens of Devon Great Consols demanded increased pay to cover food costs. While the mine owners initially met their demands, once the food price stabilised the pay rate was then reduced to previous levels causing around 200 bal maidens and boys to walkout. On their return to work the next day all the striking workers were summarily dismissed and either replaced with new workers, or re-hired at an even lower pay rate than before. Bal maidens went on strike on at least six other occasions in the 19th century, but Cornwall's high unemployment meant the strikes were generally unsuccessful as workers could easily be replaced.  Working conditions  alt=Large group of men in bowler hats and women wearing large bonnets, posing with tools From the 1840s onwards more mines provided crude shelters to protect surface workers from the worst of the weather, but at many others work at surface-level took place in the open air. Workers were generally expected to remain at their posts except in the most extreme weather conditions. Bal maidens wore gooks, a specialised bonnet which covered the shoulders and extended over the face to protect from rain, bright sunlight, flying debris and loud noise. In the winter the gook was made of felt, and in summer of cotton. Working in close proximity to heavy industrial machinery, they wore shorter dresses or skirts than the ankle-length clothing typical of the period, and their exposed lower legs were wrapped in protective coverings. Their arms were sometimes protected by hessian sleeves worn over their clothes. Some bal maidens working in cobbing and bucking wore rubber tubing on the fingers of one hand as protection from their hammer. While working bal maidens wore a waist-length hessian apron ('towser') over their clothes, and those who could afford it would have a white herden (flax and hemp) apron for wearing to and from work. These working clothes were accessorised with flowers, bows, ribbons, jewellery and other decoration. Until the end of the 19th century the working clothing of a bal maiden changed very little. Although less dangerous than work below ground, some bal maidens suffered poor health. Tuberculosis and bronchitis were endemic in the mining communities, and would be exacerbated by constant exposure to high levels of mineral dust. Constant work with damp ore might have led to rheumatic problems. The extraction of arsenic from the tin and copper ores sometimes led to exposure to arsenic fumes. Constant bending, lifting, and carrying often led to muscular strains. The need to hold chunks of ore with one hand while hammering them with the other led to some bal maidens suffering permanent damage to their left hands. The noise generated by industrial machinery, particularly after the introduction of the steam engine, could cause hearing difficulties, with some groups of bal maidens developing private sign languages. Noxious fumes, notably arsenic, lead and antimony could cause digestive problems, bowel disorders and amenorrhoea and other disruptions of the reproductive system. Barley hoggans also caused digestive problems. While some of the larger mines provided separate eating areas for bal maidens, others obliged male and female workers to eat together, a cause of consternation among some observers concerned that exposure to the \\"coarse joking\\" and \\"rude behaviour\\" of men had a negative effect on the \\"modesty and delicacy\\" expected of women. Other contemporary concerns were that heavy protective clothing led them to be unfeminine, that working in the constant view of men caused the bal maidens to have an unhealthy interest in their own appearance and attractiveness, that spending long hours at work meant that they did not have time to learn the skills to be good housewives. (Barham's 1841 investigations found no evidence to the claim that bal maidens grew up to be poor housewives, concluding that \\"they are for the most part tender mothers and industrious wives [and] the laborious occupations to which they have been inured make household duties appear comparatively light\\".) Other contemporary observers noted that bal maidens were generally good natured and well behaved, and often devoutly religious, but it is well-documented that bal maidens typically took great pride in their own appearance and clothing. Many contemporary observers commented on the high fashion of the clothing worn by bal maidens on Sundays and holidays; although the disposable income of a bal maiden was low, they would sometimes form \\"dress clubs\\" to buy fashionable clothing which they would take turns wearing. Despite the hardships and relatively low pay, Barham's 1841 investigation into the Cornish mining industry found that bal maidens generally enjoyed their work, and that those who had been in other jobs tended to prefer work at the mines. Mining had shorter hours than domestic service and was less affected by seasonal variations than farm working, the other two jobs employing significant numbers of women, and it was far easier for workers to live at home and travel to work each day, rather than lodging in their master's house or on a remote farm. Outdoor work was considered healthier than work in enclosed and smoky mines and factories, and it was sometimes believed that women who had worked as bal maidens from a young age were healthier than they would otherwise have been. From the 1780s onwards Cornwall suffered severe unemployment and poverty, and there were always large numbers of women and girls volunteering for work at the mines. The practice of giving preference to the wives, widows and children of dead or invalid miners allowed families to remain in their local area and to avoid destitution following the loss of the family's main breadwinner; work as a bal maiden also provided an opportunity for girls and young women to escape workhouses and gain financial independence. (As well as the benefits to the community of giving work to the families of invalid or dead miners, recruitment from within mining families benefited the mine owners also. The wives and children of miners could be expected to understand mining terminology and techniques, and would generally have been regular visitors to the mines delivering food to their husbands and thus be familiar with the mine's layout.)  Decline  alt=Barren landscape with a large number of tall smoking chimneys and long low buildings In around 1865, faced with increased competition from overseas mines and with the most productive copper mines becoming exhausted, the Cornish mining industry went into terminal decline. By 1880 the level of Cornish copper production was at around a quarter of its 1860 level. As production fell, the numbers of employees in the mines fell with it. Much of the copper industry collapsed, causing a movement within Cornwall from the copper to the tin mining. While some bal maidens continued to work at the mines, many worked in tin streaming in the rivers and streams flowing from the tin mining areas. In those copper mines which survived, investment in new machinery virtually ceased, so employment of some bal maidens continued. The tin industry, which was still economically successful, began to invest in new machinery to replace manual ore dressing, drastically reducing the number of female workers. By 1870 the number of bal maidens in work had fallen by around 50%. At the same time as the Cornish mining industry went into decline, public opposition to the use of female and child labour in mines was rising. The Metalliferous Mines Regulation Act 1872 brought the mines of Cornwall under the provisions of the Mines Act 1842, which had previously applied only to coal mines, limiting the use of child labour in the mines and thus increasing costs. The Act prohibited women from working underground, which the bal maidens did not do, but it also forbade any child under ten from working in any mine, even on the surface. The passing of the Factory and Workshop Act 1878 drastically limited the use of female and child labour. The employment of children under 10 was banned outright, the maximum working hours for children aged 10‚Äì14 were drastically restricted, and women were banned from working over 56 hours per week. The sudden loss of cheap child labourers made the already weakened mining industries of Cornwall and West Devon even less profitable, and more than half the mines in the area went out of business in the following decade. Some bal maidens continued to work in surviving mines and in tin-streaming, but instability in the metal markets made what remained of the mining industries increasingly unviable. In the 1880s William Ewart Gladstone's Liberal government tried to ban female labour from mines altogether; although the Bill was defeated, the number of bal maidens continued to fall. At the 1891 census the number of working bal maidens had fallen to around half its 1850s‚Äì60s peak. By 1895 only 23 mines remained operational compared to 307 in 1873, and in 1901 Devon Great Consols, the last significant copper mine in Devon and Cornwall, closed. Electrification and the introduction of Frue Vanners at the surviving mines replaced most of the jobs still done by women, and by the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 very few bal maidens remained in employment. With wartime shortages of raw materials and many younger men in the armed forces, some bal maidens were temporarily rehired to dress potash ore at a re-opened mine at St Austell, and to re-dress the existing spoil heaps of defunct mines for wolfram and arsenic.  Emigration and economic collapse  \\"The bal maidens\\"; Emily Mary Osborn As the metal mining industry on which it depended declined, and prices for staple goods rose sharply resulting from fluctuations in food prices and of the American Civil War, the economy of Cornwall collapsed. Large numbers of Cornish families emigrated to mining districts in other countries and other parts of the United Kingdom; in some former mining districts as much as of the young people moved out in the 20 years following the closure of the local mines. Between 1861 and 1900 at least 35% of Cornish women aged 15‚Äì24 moved to other parts of the UK, and over 26% left the country altogether. Although the male emigrants generally found work in mines in their new places of settlement, or put their mining skills to use digging tunnels for the rapidly growing railway networks, the jobs traditionally done by bal maidens, where they still existed, were usually done by locally recruited men or boys, and the tradition of female Cornish mine labour died out in emigrant families. While a few former bal maidens found alternative employment at local factories, and large numbers emigrated, the unemployment situation in Cornwall remained bad. As early as the 1860s, charitable schemes had begun for training former bal maidens as domestic servants, and as the textile industry of the North of England boomed a concerted effort was made to recruit Cornish women to work in the mills. Large numbers of women took up these offers; the 1891 census showed 17,757 Cornish women living in Devon (the majority working in domestic service), 10,005 in London and the surrounding suburbs of Middlesex, and 4,439 in Lancashire. In addition, the towns growing around the newly discovered mines of South Australia suffered a serious gender imbalance and made concerted efforts to recruit Cornish women. alt=Ruined and overgrown stone building with a tall stone chimney By the end of the First World War most of the more complicated tasks in the remaining mines had been mechanised, and those bal maidens who remained in work were restricted to simple manual labour of physically moving ore, spalling and overseeing the buddling frames. A successful 1919 Workers' Union campaign for a minimum 30s per week wage in the industry virtually doubled the wages of the few remaining bal maidens in Cornwall. Those at Dolcoath were made redundant within weeks of this increase. Dolcoath, the last mine in Cornwall to employ traditional bal maidens, closed in 1921, bringing the centuries-old tradition to an end. (The end of the use of bal maidens did not mean the end of female workers in those mines that survived; women continued to work in administrative roles until the final collapse of the Cornish mining industry in the late 20th century.)  After the closures  During the Second World War Britain suffered severe shortages of raw materials. While consideration was given to reopening the closed mines, this was not deemed viable and instead the few remaining mines increased their production. As many male workers were away on military service, some women were briefly employed in tin-picking at Geevor, and in ore-dressing at the Great Rock iron mine on Dartmoor, during and after the war until around 1952. Other than a very limited number of female workers after the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 ended the policy of recruiting only men for underground work in the few surviving mines, the Geevor pickers were the last female manual labourers in the Cornish mining industry. Minnie Andrews (born in Camborne in 1874), who had begun work as a racker at the age of nine, was believed to have been the last surviving former bal maiden (other than the Geevor pickers), when she died in March 1968. In 1998 South Crofty, Europe's last operational tin mine, closed, bringing metal mining in Cornwall to an end.

History The company was founded in 1986 by Gwyn Jones, Gary Helfrich, and Mike Augspurger in Cambridge, MassachusettsMerlin They were the first to manufacture bicycle frames constructed solely from titanium. Merlin became known for their meticulous and visually pleasing puddle welds. The first Merlin frame was a mountain bike frame custom-built for the defending National Mountain Bike Champion, Joe Murray. In the following year, the company began a strong relationship with frame designer Tom Kellogg, who helped them produce the world's first 3-2.5 titanium alloy road bicycle frame. In 1988, Mike Augspurger left Merlin to found One-Off Titanium in Florence, Massachusetts, a company specializing in experimental and custom-designed products for bicycles.Inventor of the Week: Archive In 1990, the Subaru- Montgomery team, consisting of Lance Armstrong, Steve Hegg, and Ken Carpenter, began its successful three-year relationship with Merlin.

It lived during the Early Permian in what is now Europe and Germany. Fossils have been found from the Ruprechtice horizon of the Intrasudetic Basin of Bohemia in the Czech Republic, as well as the Saar-Nahe Basin of southwestern Germany. Cheliderpeton had a 16 cm skull, and reached about 65 cm in length.http://www.angellis.net/Web/PDfiles/amphs.pdf Life restoration of Cheliderpeton vranyi The type species of Cheliderpeton is C. vranyi, named in 1877 by the Czech paleontologist Antonin Fritsch and found from the Czech Republic. A second species named C. latirostre was described in 1993 by J. A. Boy from Germany, after having been assigned to Archegosaurus. It differs from the type in having a less extensive preorbital region of the skull, a wider cheek region, and a snout tip that is less round and has lateral projections. Currently the two species are the only ones known to belong to Cheliderpeton, although there have been more assigned in the past that are now considered to be synonymous with the known species. \\"Actinodon germanicus\\", described by O. Kuhn in 1939 on the basis of a specimen found from the Czech Republic,\\"A. germanicus\\", was named during the time when Germany occupied Bohemia, hence the specific name. It is now known to be an unusually large individual of C. vranyi, probably in a late stage of ontogenic development. It has been suggested that C. latirostre may belong to a separate genus, either to Archegosaurus or its own distinct taxon, due to several differences between it and the type species. These differences include the concave outline of the skull roof, the expanded snout seen in adult individuals (similar to Archegosaurus decheni), and a nasal-maxilla contact in the adult stage. In 2009, C. latirostre was placed in its own genus, Glanochthon. Cheliderpeton is closely related to the genus Intasuchus from the northern pre-Ural region of Russia. Both share similarities in skull shape, as well as a short and expanded dorsal branch of the ilium and a premaxilla-maxilla suture that is anterior to the choana. Fossils of temnospondyls similar in appearance to Cheliderpeton have been found from the Autun Basin and the basin of Bourbon l'Archambault in France. Fossil Cheliderpeton may be a member of the family Archegosauridae or the family Intasuchidae. The family Archegosauridae belongs to the superfamily Archegosauroidea, but it is unsure whether Intasuchus, the type species of Intasuchidae, belongs to Archegosauroidea or the family Eryopidae, within the superfamily Eryopoidea. Thus it is unsure whether Cheliderpeton is an eryopoid (and perhaps more specifically an eryopid) or an archegosauroid. Cheliderpeton had previously been placed in the family Actinodontidae along with Actinodon, Syndyodosuchus and Sclerocephalus, but because Actinodon, the type genus of the family, is a junior synonym of the eryopid Onchiodon, the family is now considered polyphyletic.

It is known from a single species, Intasuchus silvicola, which was named in 1956. Intasuchus belongs to the family Intasuchidae and is probably its sole member, although other taxa such as Syndyodosuchus and Cheliderpeton have been assigned to the family in the past. Intasuchus most likely belongs to the group Archegosauroidea, Permian relatives of the large, mostly Mesozoic temnospondyl clade Stereospondyli. Description Intasuchus has a long, flattened skull that narrows slightly toward the front. Prominent ridges run along the skull surface from the eye sockets to the nostril openings. The otic notch at the back of the skull is relatively narrow in comparison to other temnospondyls, although it extends as a groove along the sides of the skull table. Intasuchus has large teeth on the roof of its mouth, with a large row between two openings of the palate called choanae, tusks on the palatine bones, and small teeth extending along the ectopterygoid. Classification The phylogenetic analysis of Schoch and Milner (2000) placed Intasuchus as a basal member of a group called Archegosauriformes. It was placed among archegosauroids, although Archegosauroidea was found to be a paraphyletic assemblage of taxa basal to Stereospondyli. Intasuchus silvicola was recovered as the sister taxon of Cheliderpeton latirostre (now known as Glanochthon latirostre).

As of 2016, in a joint communique, Pakistan and Turkey plan to strengthen their close ties into a \\"strategic partnership\\". Relations date back generations before the establishment of the two states, more precisely during the Turkish War of Independence when the Muslims of the northwestern British Raj sent financial aid to the declining Ottoman Empire, which was followed by the formation of the Turkish Republic and the Independence of Pakistan. Additionally, the countries share historical Islamic ties, as the Muslims living under the British Raj deemed the Ottoman Sultan as their Caliph, and the Caliph of Islam and all Muslims. Abdulhamid II, who reigned as the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1876 to 1909,used his Caliphal titles to incite the Muslims living in colonies to rebel against the European powers. As a result, Pakistan and Pakistanis have enjoyed a positive perception in Turkey and amongst Turks for many decades. Pakistan and Turkey enjoy close cultural, historical and military relations which are now expanding into deepening economic relations as both countries seek to develop their economies. Turkey supports Pakistan's position of holding a plebiscite under the UN to decide if Kashmir wants to join Pakistan, a position which Turkish President Erdogan reaffirmed in a joint address to the Pakistani parliament and which was attended by Pakistan's military high command. Turkey supports Pakistan's membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group. Talat Masood said that Turkey and Pakistan enjoy close relations during both democratic and military regimes, reflecting the depth of the relations between the two nations. Both the countries enjoy friendly relations with both usually being termed as Karde≈üler (\\"brothers\\" in Turkish).  Diplomatic Relations  Diplomatic relations between Turkey and Pakistan were established in 1947, soon after Pakistan came into being as the then largest Muslim country on world map. Turkey was among a few countries that quickly recognized Pakistan after its creation and supported its successful bid to become a member of the United Nations. Turkey established diplomatic relations soon after the independence of Pakistan in 1947 and bilateral relations became increasingly close owing to cultural, religious and geopolitical links between the two countries. Turkey was among a few countries that quickly recognized Pakistan after its creation and supported its successful bid to become a member of the United Nations.https://www.yenisafak.com/en/news/pm-khan-pushes-for-early- finalization-of-pak-turkey-strategic-economic-framework-3475130 Pakistan's founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah expressed admiration for Turkey's founding leader Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk and also a desire to develop Pakistan on the Turkish model of modernism. Similarly Pakistan would follow the footstep of Muhammad Ali Jinnah and Allama Iqbal to develop a modern Islamic Pakistan and all other so called ism are rejected by people of Pakistan. Similar ideas were expressed by the former President of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf, who grew up in Turkey and had received extensive military training there. Jinnah is honoured as a great leader in Turkey, and a major road of the Turkish capital Ankara, the Cinnah Caddesi is named after him, while roads in Islamabad, Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar, and Larkana are named after Atat√ºrk. On 26 October 2009, Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan was awarded the Nishan-e-Pakistan and was the fourth world leader who spoke to the Pakistani parliament. Economic Relations  Pak- Turkey Strategic Economic Framework  The framework aims to enhance bilateral economic cooperation with particular focus on trade and investment.  Investment & Trade  The Abdullah Gul Interchange near Allama Iqbal International Airport in Lahore, this interchange was inaugurated by the Turkish President Abdullah Gul during his visit to Lahore in 2010. Turkey and Pakistan are founding members of the Economic Cooperation Organization and part of the Developing 8 Countries (D-8) organization. Both nations have worked to negotiate a preferential trading agreement, aiming to considerably increase trade and investments, especially in transport, telecommunications, manufacturing, tourism and other industries. Both governments have sought to increase the volume of bilateral trade from $690 million to more than $1 billion by 2010. Pakistani exports include rice, sesame seeds, leather, textiles, fabrics, sports goods, and medical equipment. Turkey's exports to Pakistan include wheat, chickpeas, lentils, diesel, chemicals, transport vehicles, machinery and energy products. Turkish private corporations have also invested significantly in industrial and construction projects developing highways, pipelines and canals. The two countries are negotiatating the Turkey-Pakistan Free Trade Agreement.  Historical and Cultural Relations  Shashlik, a common Eurasian dish. Regions of both modern-day Turkey and Pakistan in the domain of the Persian Empire. The regions comprising both Pakistan and Turkey have been mutually influenced by contiguous Persian, Hellenistic, Arab and Turco-Mongol cultures at various points in history. By the fifth century BCE, the Achaemenid Empire spread from Anatolia to the Indus River, introducing Persianate cultural and political traditions to these regions. Common Hellenistic influence following the conquests of Alexander the Great. Modern-day Turkey was home to many ancient European civilizations, including that of the Ionian Greeks. The country has many traces of cultural and historical influences from the ancient Greeks, including many Greek and Hellenistic archeological sites found in the region. Pakistan was also influenced by Greek culture and civilization in the aftermath of Alexander the Great's conquest of the Indus Valley, which later led to the development of the Indo-Greek Kingdoms and Greco-Buddhism. Gandhara, a region in western Pakistan, was a major thoroughfare of Hellenistic, Iranic and Indo-Aryan contact. Turkey became a Turkic-speaking country as a result of Seljuq conquest and Turkification of the region. Though Pakistan is not a Turkic- speaking country, its major languages, particularly Urdu (also known as LashkariKhan, Sajjad, Waqas Anwar, Usama Bajwa, and Xuan Wang. \\"Template Based Affix Stemmer for a Morphologically Rich Language.\\" International Arab Journal of Information Technology (IAJIT) 12, no. 2 (2015).), are strongly influenced by the Turkic language of the Mughals before it became the empire's official language. As a result, it has borrowed many loanwords from Chagatai. The etymology of the word \\"Urdu\\" traces itself back to Mughal rule, believed to be coined by the poet Mashafi. Moreover, the common cultural influences on Pakistan and Turkey span several centuries, as many Turkic and Iranic peoples ruled vast areas of Central Asia, South Asia and the Middle East. The designs of clothing of the two countries also have common origins in Central Asia. Food is also similar to some extent such as Kebab, Pilaf and Halva although the spice content in Pakistan is different due to South Asian influence. Both Turkey and Pakistan practice the Hanafi school of Sunni Islam, which was the interpretation of Islam implemented by the Ottoman Empire and Mughal Empire respectively. Robust traditions of moderate Sufism exist and the religious ministers of both nations frequently contact each other. Many Turks still remember the sacrifices and donations by fellow Pakistani's to help Turkey in its beginning days to pay off debts when they were themselves poor. Pakistani's helped during the Khalifat movement which was formed to protect the Khalifa in Turkey and to demand fair treatment of Turkey after losing the world war. It was just the Turks against the world, and the Turks felt disheartened & disillusioned with this lack of support, and Turkish national memory has been traumatized by the betrayal of fellow Muslims in a brutal war of survival, against the full might of non-Muslim western powers. It was in these dark times that Shaukat Ali and Mohammad Ali Johar (from Pakistan) published an article in the Urdu weekly Hamdard' and English weekly Comrade' saying the Turks were justified in their fight against the British. During the Turkish war of independence, Ali brothers engaged in extensive tours across the length and breath of the Indian subcontinent focusing on Muslim towns located mostly in present-day Pakistan. They travelled with green robed volunteers, making passionate appeals to help the desperate Turks in need. On one of his fundraising tours Shaukat Ali announced to shake hands with only those who made contributions for the Turkish funds, and those who made large contributions he allowed them to kiss his hand. Allama Iqbal on the other hand kept busy in providing poetic inspiration to the Turkish struggle against western powers, holding large poetry meetings, addressing massive crowds and making sentimental appeals urging Muslims of Indian to fund the Turkish war effort. But the real reason for the success of this fundraising campaign was the popular support from ordinary Muslims of the subcontinent, that still echoes in the hearts of the people of Pakistan. Incredible stories of sacrifice and support by men, women and even children are still remembered in households across Pakistan. One such instance is when, Khilafat volunteers at the Dargah of Ajmer Sharif got so many generous donations, in cash and gold ornaments that, Khilafat volunteers went out of all the receipts they had In the aerial war of Turkey and Israel, Pakistan sent its soldiers to help Turkey.  Pakistan Turkey relations in present times  Relations of the two countries have been strong with Prime Minister Imran Khan visiting Turkey followed by a visit of Pakistan by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in February 2020. Pakistanis enjoy the gracious attitude of ordinary Turks towards Pakistanis and are often termed as Karde≈ü(brother). Turkish television shows have huge popularity in Pakistan with recently the Turkish show Ertugrul Ghazi being dubbed by Pakistan Television Corporation in the Urdu language, and has taken the country by storm. Turks also enjoy VIP treatment in Pakistan with much of the Pakistani public terming Turkey as their best friend and vice versa from Turkey. Erdoƒüan became one of the few world leaders to be given an opportunity to make give a speech in the Pakistani parliament and he is quoted saying \\"I pray that Allah (God) makes the solidarity between us strong and permanent\\" and \\"As in the past, we will continue to stand by Pakistan in the future\\". Both the countries announced dual citizenship under the citizenship initiative, in which the citizens of Pakistan and Turkey would be able to attain joint citizenship and dual passports. Pakistani and Turkish Armed Forces also hold many joint training sessions and Turkey imports arms from Pakistan. On 17 May 2020, The lead actress of Ertuƒürul, Esra Bilgi√ß, tweeted \\"I suggest one flag for one nation\\". Kashmir conflict The Turkish ambassador spent a week in Pakistan administered Kashmir's capital city of Muzaffarabad to express solidarity with the Kashmir cause. President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan recently expressed that Turkey stands with Pakistan on Kashmir issue bringing opposition from India  Trilateral Ankara cooperation process  Turkey launched a trilateral summit process between the two states and Afghanistan in February 2007, following a visit by then Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah G√ºl to Islamabad, as the backbone of its diversified foreign policy in Southeast Asia and Pakistani deputy Humair Hayat Khan Rokhri confirmed that according to G√ºl \\"we are all brothers who need to support each other\\", in order to, \\"bring security and stability to the region\\". A 1 April 2009 meeting between Pakistani and Afghan leaders, conducted as part of the trilateral Ankara cooperation process, saw the three countries pledged to increase coordination between their political, military and intelligence tiers in the fight against militancy and terrorism. Chairman of the Turkish‚ÄìPakistani Friendship Association Burhan Kayat√ºrk has stated that, \\"It is the first time that the military and intelligence chiefs of Afghanistan and Pakistan have attended the trilateral summit, which is a reflection of the deeper commitment to work together\\". At 17 April 2009 Friends of Pakistan Tokyo Donors Conference, Turkish State Minister Mehmet Aydƒ±n pledged $100 million to Pakistan for infrastructure, health and education projects. Turkish Parliamentary Deputy Kayat√ºrk has called on neighbouring countries, including India, to make similar commitments as \\"It is in their interests to see a stable Pakistan; otherwise violence will spill over into their territory\\". Pakistani and Afghan parliamentary deputies came together in Ankara on 5 May 2009, as part of the trilateral Ankara cooperation process, where they met with the now Turkish President G√ºl and new Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoƒülu to discuss a variety of issues. Head of the Turkish Parliament's Foreign Relations Commission Murat Mercan stated; > \\"Today we need cooperation between our countries more than ever. I believe > Turkey, having historical brotherhood relations with both, is in a special > position to improve and deepen this cooperation. Turkey is confident that > the cooperation to be established between Afghanistan and Pakistan will help > a lot to solve the problems\\". Chairman of the Pakistani Parliament's Foreign Relations Commission Asfandyar Wali Khan conveyed his thanks and stated, :\\"We need Turkey‚Äôs support to build stability in the region\\". Mercan concluded, :\\"We are finally on the verge of institutionalising the trilateral Ankara cooperation process within the framework of parliamentary joint initiatives\\", with follow-up meetings due to be held in Islamabad and Kabul at four-month intervals\\". Kadir Topba≈ü Chowk in Lahore, Pakistan inaugurated by Kadir Topba≈ü, The Mayor of Istanbul (Turkey) on 12 March 2012  Security Relations  Pakistan and Turkey have maintained long-standing military ties with Turkey also providing training to Pakistani air force officers in upgrading its F-16 fleet. On 2 April 1954, Pakistan and Turkey signed a treaty of friendship and cooperation. Both countries, valued as important states in their regions, joined the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO) aimed to bolster military and strategic cooperation and counter the spread of communism and Soviet influence in the region. Turkey has openly supported Pakistan's stance on the Kashmir conflict. Ankara, further, recognizes Jammu and Kashmir, as part of Pakistan, with which it endeavours to 'spice up' bilateral relations, and the Turkish ambassador to Pakistan spent nearly a week in Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan administered kashmir, in order to show Turkish solidarity with the Pakistanis in regards to Kashmir and maintained political and military support during its wars with India. Pakistan has reciprocated by expressing support for Turkey's policy on Northern Cyprus. Both nations have sought to expand cooperation to fight terrorism. Both countries are also members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. Turkey is also currently a major arms seller to Pakistan. Turkey previously purchased arms from Pakistan and continuous to purchase minor aerial weapons and components from Pakistan. The Pakistan and Turkish Air Force signed a deal to purchase 52 Super Mushak trainer turbo-props from Pakistan for Turkey to help train new pilots and support recovery of the Turkish Armed Forces in the aftermath of pilot shortages after the attempted coup. In July 2018 Pakistan's navy signed a contract for the acquisition of four MILGEM-class (MILGEM project) ships from Turkey which is the largest single military export deal of Turkey worth $1.5 billion. Pakistan Navy Commander Admiral Zafar Mahmood Abbasi and Erdogan cut the first metal plate of the first of the four MILGEM Ada class corvette during a ceremony held on 29 Sep 2019. Over the last decade, nearly 1,500 Pakistani military officers have received training in Turkey. The two are already collaborating on drone production, while Turkish and Pakistani troops held joint counter-terror exercises with Uzbek forces in Uzbekistan in April 2019. Both could soon join forces to develop and co-produce their own fighter jet after which they could go in together on a stealth fighter. Turkish military attaches from each branch of its armed forces have been posted in the Pakistani embassy in Ankara, and Turkey helped upgrade a batch of F-16 fighter jets for the Pakistan Air Force, manufacturing engines as well as spare parts. Both countries have come even closer militarily owing to security situation around their neighbors as well as due to instability in ties with the US recently. In November 2019, Navies of both countries participated in drills in the Mediterranean and Arabian Sea.  Aid exchange  In the aftermath of the 2005 Kashmir earthquake, Turkey stepped up its efforts to help the Pakistani people of the affected areas. Turkey announced a package of $150 million for the quake-hit people. The Turkish aid organization Kizilay also constructed a mosque in Pakistan's azad Kashmir region bordering Indian Jammu & Kashmir. The mosque is being built in the Ottoman Style in Pakistan's Bagh District. Pakistan supplied Turkey with aid during the 1999 earthquake and during the 2011 Van earthquake.

The poem, though borrowing heavily from prior literary sources of Greek and Roman Antiquity, attempts to go beyond the established versions of the myth by reconfiguring the narrative structure handed down by Ovid. Through the incorporation of highly innovative poetic techniques, G√≥ngora effectively advances the background story of Acis and Galatea‚Äôs infatuation as well as the jealousy of the Cyclops Polyphemus. The Polifemo was completed in manuscript form in 1613 and was subsequently published in 1627 after G√≥ngora‚Äôs death (see 1627 in poetry). The work is traditionally regarded as one of G√≥ngora‚Äôs most lofty poetic endeavors and is arguably his finest artistic achievement along with the Soledades. The Polifemo, in sum, realizes the final stage of G√≥ngora‚Äôs sophisticated poetic style, which slowly developed over the course of his career. In addition to the Soledades and other later works, the Polifemo demonstrates the fullest extent of G√≥ngora‚Äôs highly accentuated, erudite and impressionistic poetic style known as culteranismo. As made evident in the opening of the poem, the Polifemo was dedicated to the Count of Niebla, a Castilian nobleman renowned for his generous patronage of 17th century Spain‚Äôs most preeminent artists.Hanak 3 The work‚Äôs predominant themes, jealousy and competition, reflect the actual competitive environment and worldly aspirations that drove 17th-century poets such as G√≥ngora to cultivate and display their artistic ingenuity. G√≥ngora wrote his Polifemo in honor of Luis Carillo y Sotomayor's Fabula de Acis y Galatea, which was a contemporary poem depicting the same mythological account. Additionally, the poem of Carillo y Sotomayor was in deed dedicated to the very same Count of Niebla. Luis Carrillo y Sotomayor was both G√≥ngora‚Äôs friend and a fellow ‚Äúculteranist‚Äù poet who died at the age of 27 in 1610, three years before G√≥ngora's Polifemo was completed. The premature death of a promising pupil in a sense prompted the creation of the Polifemo. Conventional restraints; the Polifemo and poetic liberation in the Spanish Baroque The Polifemo is unprecedented for G√≥ngora in terms of its length, its florid style, and its ingenio (artistic ingenuity or innovation). Regarding its literary form, the poem develops in a manner that is distinctively unmindful of the mediating artistic clarity outlined in Aristotle‚Äôs Poeticssee Aristotle's Poetics (Quotation Pending) Contemporary critics such as Luis Carrillo y Sotomayor would come to see these Aristotelian precepts as artistically stifling. In his Libro de la Erudici√≥n Po√©tica, Carillo formally denounces both clarity and straightforwardness, particularly when such artistic ideals placed parameters on poetic expression in an effort to make \\"oneself intelligible to the half-educated.\\" see Carillo's Libro de la Erudici√≥n Po√©tica (1611) Though culteranismo maintained this elitist and aristocratic quality well after Carillo's death, this seemingly haughty comment on the part of G√≥ngora's pupil was actually a jibe at G√≥ngora's fiercest critics whose periodic vitriol sought to discredit the artist and his work. This fundamental debate between artistic clarity, intelligibility, lyricism, novelty and free expression first outlined in the Poetics of Aristotle and debated in the literary circles of posterity would never cease to divide artists throughout the modern era. Culteranismo, which was particularly fond of playful obscurity, has consequently incurred the disdain of several critics for its liberal artistic outlooks, which critics lampooned as frivolous and pedantic.see Jauregi's \\"Discurso po√©tico contra el hablar culto y oscuro\\" (1624) and \\"Ant√≠doto contra la pestilente poes√≠a de las Soledades\\" (1624) The primacy of ingenio contradicted the claims of more traditional critics who sought to tame instinct by imposing a rigorous aesthetic framework of poetic regulations derived from the ancients in order to establish a more coherent dialogue with the audience or reader. Critics such as Juan Mart√≠nez de J√°uregui y Aguilar and Francisco de Quevedo, for reasons related to their obscure lyricism, saw culternanist poets as highly affected, superficial and purposefully obscure with the intention of masking poetic mediocrity with highly ornate phraseology.see Quevedo's \\"Aguaja de Navegar Cultos\\" Regardless of the charges levied against his style, G√≥ngora would remain one of the most influential poets of the Spanish Baroque and would influence in turn the styles of even his most malicious critics.See \\"Nueva Poes√≠a. Conceptismo, Culteranismo en la Cr√≠tica Espa√±ola\\" by Collard (in Progress) The sophisticated metaphors displayed in the Polifemo would later inspire French symbolists such as Paul VerlaineWarshaw 1 as well as modern Spanish poets such as Federico Garc√≠a Lorca and fellow members of the Generation of '27. Culteranismo has always retained a highly arcane and esoteric quality throughout the centuries which would eventually inform the mystical nostalgia definitive to the poetry of other 20th century modernist poets. Along with conceptismo, culteranismo largely defined Spanish Baroque Poetry. Culteranismo, as a 17th-century artistic movement, sought to elevate pure ingenio over the ideal of imitatio (Latin term for artistic imitation), a tendency that dominated Renaissance poetry (see ad fontes). The ambiguity of culternanists would continue to incur criticism from more conservative Spanish poets and thinkers for centuries. Plot summary and analysis The Polifemo is composed of 63 stanzas, each of which are composed of 8 lines in total. In its entirety, the Polifemo comprises 504 lines. Throughout the poem there is an abundance of poetic correspondences (i.e. organic or interior referencing), which contrast sharply with the abstruse quality of the cultismos (i.e. highly idiosyncratic linguistic modifications, classical lexicon and scholarly references) themselves. Additionally, the ornamentality and detail of the work is further complicated by a profuse usage of classical symbolism and external referencing (i.e. relevant mythological accounts communicated through metaphors and anecdotes). A cultismo, though often intuited as an umbrella term for a particular display of culteranismo, can be thought of as a poetic device that abandons the precision of ordinary language for the sake of artistic expression. Within the poem, parallelism, proportionality, dissonance and intricate array of puns involving both similitude and antithesis also give the poem greater complexity than that of its classical predecessors. Opening (dedication to the Patron of Niebla) ‚Äì Stanzas 1‚Äì3 The elaborate summoning of the Sicilian Muse Thalia celebrates antiquity and the pastoral genre. Furthermore, this introduction involving a Grecian muse emphasizes ingenio itself over that of a more rudimentary imitation delineated by regulations and set expectations. Imitatio (the reverential imitation of the art of the ancients) was prevalent in Renaissance poetry as seen in the verse of the highly influential Spanish poet Garcilaso de la Vega who in turn borrowed heavily from the Italian Dolce Stil Novo poets, such as Petrarch, who revolutionized the poetry of the 14th and 15th centuries. The Cave and the World of Polifemo ‚Äì Stanzas 4‚Äì12 Contrary to the tranquil and idealized settings typical of the pastoral genre, G√≥ngora maintains a fluctuating Background‚ÄìForeground dynamic throughout the Polifemo, which makes itself apparent at the very beginning of the poem. Given his fondness for convoluted and self-fashioned metaphors in addition to his profuse use of hiperbat√≥n, the quality of the lyrical poetry defamiliarizes and reconfigures all aspects of the original narration (see ostranenie). The presence of contrasts, of antithesis and dissimilitude reflects a veritable lack of aesthetic concentration as well as deficient narrative unity deemed necessary in traditional Aristotelean aesthetics. Instead, G√≥ngora juxtaposes conflicting images of beauty and ugliness, harmony and discord to hint at an underlying dichotomy of erotic love as both prolific and destructive. The interspersing of the unsavory and the melancholic with the idyllic deviates from the Renaissance ideal, which differentiated forms by establishing boundaries, namely foregrounds and backgrounds where central objects or figures displaced the prominence of other things. Within the art of the Renaissance, there is a higher degree of hermetic focus, concentration and stability of form. ‚ÄúIn contrast to the classical delineation of boundaries‚Äù, which gives precedence to forms with greater density and texture, the Baroque style sought to dissolve the divisions between the ‚Äòintended figure‚Äô and ‚Äòunintended background‚Äô or apeirion ‚Äúin favor of a vision characterized by ‚Äòa mysterious interflow of form and light and colour.‚Äô‚Äù.Dolan 225 The Stag hunt at Aranjuez by Juan Bautista Mart√≠nez del Mazo (1665) In G√≥ngora's description of the scenery and the characters of the Polifemo, the descriptions themselves become the focus and take on an existence of their own. No longer are properties subordinate to the objects from which they emanate. No longer is there the subjugation of form required in Renaissance art. Instead, the Baroque is often characterized by a breakdown in such distinctions and the deterioration of these established ideals. As with Baroque visual art, within the Polifemo, there is a genuine lack of easily recognizable forms. In turn, this new awareness and appreciation of form in-itself became the chief artistic concern for culteranists, a group of like-minded poets who furthermore celebrated and, at the same time, critiqued the Western Humanist and Hermeneutic traditions of this epoch. The figures of the Polifemo themselves are often depersonalized by their metaphoric descriptions, by anecdote and by the portrayal of their circumstance or immediate environment in which they are blended. In the context of Baroque aesthetics, depersonalization in this sense is not the complete abandonment or deterioration of the individual as a distinguishable entity, but emphasizes instead the justification of those characters as forms themselves. The objective individual exists as both a series of phenomena as well as an aspect of the overall representation. Conversely, it is the subject who is the ultimate arbiter of artistic experience though they also limited to merely reflect a bundle of individual perceptions and privately held associations. Using this understanding, the distinction between Polyphemus and his cave is no longer deemed relevant as an overarching sympathy exists between the two. All of these forms serve an aesthetic purpose of preeminent importance as both capture the melancholic sense of longing and neglect that G√≥ngora attempts to develop and incorporate into the overall narration. Ultimately, it is the poet who goes beyond the mere resemblance and commonality of things as orchestrator of inter-subjectivity to both imagine and project a kindred will. This issue of similitude and the underlying perception of persistent sympathies that arise between two separate entities was an idea deeply rooted in the 16th century √©pist√©m√®, as Michel Foucault exposes in his highly influential work Les Mots et Les Choses.see Foucault's \\"The Prose of the World\\", second chapter within The Order of Things: An Archaeology of the Human Sciences (1970) Galatea described ‚Äì Stanzas 13‚Äì17 G√≥ngora portrays Galatea as both the inspiration whom the whole island of Sicily admires and adores. He goes on to deify her in the minds and rituals of the Sicilian locals. Her femininity remains the unparalleled source of inspiration for all of the inhabitants of the island as well as 'the good' (summum bonum), the ultimate pursuit and the sole object of desire. The sanctification of feminine beauty and grace eventually leads to an emerging cult of Galatea. Description of Sicily ‚Äì 18‚Äì24 Sicily, the setting of the tale, resembles the classical archetype of Arcadia. This contrasts sharply with the Darkness of Polyphemus‚Äô cave. Contrasts or dissimilitude were often employed in Baroque art, more so than in the art of the Renaissance. As Enrica Cancelliere explains in her article \\"Dibujo y Color en la fabula de Polifemo y Galatea\\", the commonality of aesthetic interests existing between visual and poetic artists was often quite remarkable during the Baroque epoch: > Cancelliere 279 > Being a work written during the Baroque Epoch, an epoch which favored the > profuse use of contrasts in painting more so than any of the other period in > Western History, the Fable of Polyphemus and Galatea takes upon itself this > very theme concerning chromatic contrasts, the clash between darkness and > radiance. The poem was written with a technique akin to the chiaroscuro > style one would see in the visual arts. As D√°maso Alonso wrote: \\"On one > side, there is this gloomy presence, that accompanies that which is > monstrous, that which is foreboding, that which is surly, that which is > grotesque; at the same time, there is the presence of the precious flower > and the purest of silver, that which is immaculate, the crystalline, that > which is sweet, immortal and beautiful.

If at the poles we find the limits of the chromatic scale -white and > black-, in the interior, the painting explodes with specks of vivid color, > dissolve to the oxymoronic that by means of the underlying symbolic meanings > construct whole images, characters, settings, thoughts and emotions. The Denial of St. Peter by Caravaggio (c. 1610) This poetic trend entranced with antithesis is concurrent with the Chiaroscuro style that matured in 17th century Western painting. The striking contrast of the poem rests in the juxtaposition of the dark, gloomy and burdened existence of Polifemo with the figure of Galatea, the paragon of light, beauty and contentedness. ;Description of Acis and the meeting of the lovers ‚Äì Stanza 25 An interesting correlation of G√≥ngora's poem to that of the classical source is the individual's appeal through his pedigree. The divine lineages of the two suitors, an issue of prevalence within classical works, is incorporated into the poem. ;Meeting of the two lovers and courtship ‚Äì Stanzas 26‚Äì37 In these lines, Acis pursues Galatea with a different approach than his wistful cycloptic rival. John McCaw in ‚ÄúTurning a Blind Eye: Sexual Competition, Self- Nontraditional, and the Impotence of Pastoral in G√≥ngora‚Äôs Fabula de Polifemo y Galatea‚Äù affirms that Acis's courtship stratagem engages the sensuality of Galatea and triumphs over the ‚Äúcontemplative love‚Äù of Polifemo.McCaw 30 Acis expresses his desire through means of luxurious material offerings, hinting at the old pagan practice of the Anathema, as well as unadulterated ‚Äúerotic passion‚Äù that is not transcendent and thus, anti-intellectual. ;The consummation of the lovers ‚Äì Stanzas 38‚Äì42 In these stanzas, Galatea's inaccessible character as an ideal (see Platonic idealism) is made tangible: > ‚ÄúFollowing the initial shock, Galatea becomes somewhat friendlier and less > inaccessible. She coaxes the lucky young man to his feet; sweet and smiling, > she is now ready to give, not peace to sleep, but indeed allowing a truce to > rest, i.e., not excluding it, but postponing it for later. A hollow rock > forms a shady cover for a cool, inviting settee with ivy twines serving as > green shutters, climbing around trunks and embracing rocks.‚Äù (English Prose > Translation by Miroslav John HanakHanak 106) Song of the Cyclops ‚Äì Stanzas 43‚Äì58 Contrary to Acis, Polyphemus represents failed self-cultivation, convention as opposed to nature, and the fruitless application of the virtues of neo-platonic thought, which stressed upward progression, refinement, beauty and universal harmonyRicapito, Josph V. \\"Galatea's Fall and the Inner Dynamics of Gongora's Fabula de Polifemo y Galatea.\\" Need Source Unlike the usual burlesque representations of Polyphemus and Galatea (as seen in Theocritus), the words of the G√≥ngora's Cyclops are incongruous with his outward appearance and his essential barbarism. The emphasis on the intellect, the dialectical or, the ancient rationalism Aristophanes satirically labelled as \\"thinkery\\" (Phrontisterion - from The Clouds) as well as the vigilance against moral and bodily corruption are central to neo-platonic understanding that finds its way into this bucolic landscape through the most unlikely of characters. Throughout the poem the Cyclops's eye is identified with the sun, a traditional Apollonian symbol for dispassionate truth or enlightenment. The Cyclops realizes his surrogate beauty in the form of discourse and song, which he contrasts with the tangible beauty of a lover. It is within the Song of the Cyclops where Polyphemus arises from his obscurity. His perpetual pain and incessant longing drive his lyrics. It is through his situation that his art emerges. As stated by Cancelliere in her investigation of the poem's visual dynamics, primordial darkness itself, embodied by the character of Polifemo, seems to be the recurring cradle and grave of all perception or advancement: > Cancelliere 270 > The night, in its vacuity, welcomes the possibility for redefinition or > regeneration and this is possible not merely by means of its concavity, its > uterine topology which begs to be filled, but by means of the natural > overturning occurring firstly on this very chromatic dimension, connoting > the black, the absolute absence of color, an infinite receptive and > regenerative possibility: realm of possibilities where one can await the > recurrent birth of light, of life, of both profundity and form and, > ultimately, the esoteric cavern of Plato, of those ancient rites and of > those long forgotten mysteries. Lovers discovered, death and transformation of Acis ‚Äì Stanzas 59‚Äì63 In the versions of both G√≥ngora and Ovid, the ending of the poem is one of violence and transformation. In both tales, after the Cyclops laments, the two lovers are eventually discovered, thus provoking the anger of Polyphemus who strikes the fleeing Acis with a boulder that he rips from the landscape. In both the Latin and the Spanish poem, the youthful Acis is crushed and killed by Polyphemus's striking boulder. Only after violent death is the boy is subsequently transformed into a river. Background, the classical precursors of the Polifemo and poetic innovation Though the mythological characters themselves can be traced to various pre-Hellenistic sources, such as book 9 of the Odyssey, the comprehensive artistic representation of the fabled lovers‚Äô tryst, the rejection and consequent dejection of Polyphemus and the subsequent murder of Acis was realized much later in Ovid‚Äôs Metamorphoses. Nevertheless, Ovid was not the first poet to exploit the poetic potential of these mythical figures. Though his influence on this poem is less direct, the founder of the bucolic or pastoral genre, Theocritus, wrote a burlesque poem representing Polyphemus and his unrequited love for the Sea-nymph Galatea. The pastoral genre was subject to later imitation by other prominent figures of antiquity, as seen in Virgil‚Äôs Eclogues, as well as by prominent figures of the Italian and Spanish Renaissance, such as Petrarch and Garcilaso de la Vega. In Theocritus, Ovid and G√≥ngora, the Songs of the Cyclops resemble one another to varying degrees. The two classical poems, which served as the framework for Gongora‚Äôs version, are characterized by the Cyclops‚Äôs invocation of Galatea which retains both a presumptuous and wistful tone. Some shared characteristics of classical origin are: #Theocritus and Ovid have Polyphemus compare Galatea‚Äôs physical beauty and allusiveness to natural and pastoral phenomena. The lamenting of Polyphemus is marked by the statement of her rejection of him and his consequent despondence. In Theocritus, ‚ÄúPolyphemus‚Äô four comparisons are with the daily business of agriculture and husbandry, made special nevertheless by the endearing simplicity of this Cyclops.‚ÄùLehrer 19 In contrast, G√≥ngora portrays Polyphemous as deeply poetic and sophisticated despite his ferocious appearance, lifestyle and the egotistical/antisocial disposition. #There exists in all three poems a description of his unappealing physical appearance. G√≥ngora's song is more subtle and consciously avoids the burlesque comedy found in Ovid. #Polyphemus lists his fecundity or material wealth in all 3 poems. #Polyphemus admonishes Galatea to be with him. Theocritus's version ends in the young Cyclop's self- reprimands. Furthermore, The tone is purely innocent and humorous, while hope for another love remains. Though other imitations and related works exist, the primary inspiration for G√≥ngora was undoubtedly Ovid who portrayed the tale in a way that conformed to the Metamorphoses's integral theme of transformation where beginnings and ends that feed into one another. Though the narrative structure differs substantially from that found in Ovid's version, G√≥ngora assumes a similar plot with the Cyclops's murder of Acis followed by the young boy's transformation. Though Ovid's work serves as the thematic and narrative framework for the Polifemo, G√≥ngora doesn‚Äôt seem content to merely imitate Ovid. The two poets had different aspirations that are clear to distinguish. In writing the Metamorphoses, Ovid sought to compose a narrative of mythic time united by the theme of constant transformation. Ovid's intention is, thus, cosmological in nature. Given his drastically opposing style and clear deviation from the ancient poet's narrative structure, the Spanish poet attempts to reexamine this popular myth, which grants him wide parameters for the display of his sophisticated wit as well as a peculiar aesthetic sensibility that are not nearly as developed in the Roman's poem. Deviations from the Ovidian portrayal and Gongorine innovation There are several notable differences in terms of content that distinguish the Polifemo from its predecessor. As Melinda Eve Lehrer states in her work Classical Myth and the ‚ÄúPolifemo‚Äù of G√≥ngora, ‚ÄúG√≥ngora made many innovations in the myth which he inherited from Ovid. Some of them have a merely ornamental function, while others are organically essential to G√≥ngora‚Äôs poem.‚ÄùLehrer 28 There are several ornamental additions that detract from the narration that are obviously not present in its classical counterpart: Furthermore, as Leher points out, when displaying his wealth and fecundity:Lehrer 29 In addition to ornamental descriptions giving life to the Cyclops' mundane possessions, G√≥ngora often incorporates anecdotes that detract from the overall narration as in St. 50-53 regarding the shipwrecked Genoese merchants. The thematic aloofness of G√≥ngora's verse contrasts sharply with his purely conceptista contemporaries who valued a verbal economy of correspondences and a less convoluted interplay between words (signs) and their meaning (signifiers) as the true testament of wit, which they in turn used to costume a thematic focus. G√≥ngora recreates events by focusing on the sensual impressions granted by the narrative. This reluctance to appeal to or rely on preconceived abstractions and prosaic lexicon and expressions forces the reader to reconstruct meaning. Given his highly sensorial lyrics and his reluctance to directly engage or placate the reader's understanding, literary critics, such as D√°maso Alonso, have labeled G√≥ngora's style as particularly impressionistic.Alonso: Estudios y Ensayos Gongorinos and Poes√≠a Espa√±ola: Ensayo de M√©todos y L√≠mites Estil√≠sticos The murder of Acis: Premeditated vs. crime of passion Ovid, Gongora's predecessor, portrays Acis‚Äô murder as a premeditated act: > ‚ÄúWell, he may please himself for all of that, but what I don‚Äôt like is, he > pleases YOU, Galatea ‚Äìjust let me at the guy, he‚Äôll learn that I‚Äôm as strong > as I am big! I‚Äôll tear his living guts out and I‚Äôll scatter his body parts > in fields and in your waters, so you can mingle with his mangled limbs.‚Äù10 > (Translation Bk. XIII of the Metamorphoses ln. 1249-1259) Unlike Ovid, G√≥ngora does not opt for such a calculating and cold-blooded portrayal of Polyphemus and instead stresses the impetuousness of the genuinely committed Cyclops as he accidentally catches the two lovers together: This underlying difference hints at G√≥ngora's primary concern with form and his concern in capturing the full aesthetic effect through his representation of the emotional torrents of love, jealousy and murder. Stephen Wagschal argues in \\"Mas no cabr√°s all√°\\": G√≥ngora's Early Modern Representation of the Modern Sublime‚Äù that in doing this, G√≥ngora fully demonstrates the aesthetic character of the sublime, as Kant defined it, where the sublime in its dynamic form inevitably occurs at the climax of the narrative itself. The revelation of betrayal is accentuated by an analogous impression of the sublime as experienced in nature. This impression is the precursor to violence, destruction and the complete devolution of the Cyclops to his natural state. Essentially, G√≥ngora pushes the concept of jealousy to its fullest extent by interfacing the human emotion with its corresponding destructive aspect of nature. Within the scope of the Polifemo, the presence of ugliness and the grotesque which taints the Arcadian landscape of the pastoral, proves predestined to annihilate both the beauty and harmony inherent in pastoral naivety, something which was cherished in both Renaissance art and the ancient bucolic.Wagschal 179 Even in paradise, where a harmonious and fruitful relationship between the loved and beloved remains a possibility, love never forms or subsists in a vacuum and is instead constantly tested and reshaped by the external realities that also allowed for it. Love eventually enters into a state of disequilibrium where both exterior circumstance and the instrinsic instability of the emotion jointly transmute the original form. The intemperance of love and the existence of evil as the result neglecting the good are deeply rooted in a non-Christian pagan morality birthed by Socrates in which excess and evil are the products of ignorance, which can be effectively ameliorated with proper education. Evil is a condition when perceived through the lens of this highly deterministic outlook, which contrasts sharpely with the Judeo-Christian explanation for the existence of evil. Instead of relying upon a preexisting cosmological force and the doctrine of Original Sin, the pagans offered a much more rational explanation that rested in the philosophical categorization that delineated the good. All conditions contrary to this understanding were in a sense flawed to various extents (see Nichomean Ethics). The beauty of Galatea: The material vs. the transcendental Within pre-Christian texts the portrayal of Galatea differs drastically from that of early modern depictions. Certain recurrent images present in Ovid and Theocritus that seem to be avoided altogether in Renaissance and Baroque poems are the mundane associations that pertain to her femininity. According to Ignasi Rib√≥, when emphasizing the blancura or ‚Äúwhiteness‚Äù of Galatea, Theocritus and Ovid both utilize the metaphor of milk. In fact, etymologically Galatea can be translated to mean ‚Äúmilk-white.‚Äù Nevertheless, within the context of G√≥ngora's poem a reference or metaphor to milk does not occur. Given that G√≥ngora was fully aware of this, it is interesting that he consciously choose to filter this image out of his Polifemo. Rib√≥ notes that G√≥ngora opts instead for other representations of feminine beauty that appeal to the platonic or Marian or Beatricean abstraction of femininity. Some examples are, ‚Äúm√°s brillante que el cristal‚Äù (brighter than cristal) and ‚Äúm√°s luciente que el hielo‚Äù (more translucent than ice). Rib√≥ believes that this transposition of feminine ideal corresponds to the neo-platonic tradition that became exceedingly popular in the later stages of Roman antiquity. These philosophical trends undoubtedly allowed for the gradual Christianization of the empire. Rib√≥ would elaborate that medieval Christianity greatly shaped European perceptions and taste placing parameters on those of even the most avid of Humanists during the Renaissance. Character portrayals: Galatea Ovid seems to represent Galatea as entirely helpless and passive as she laments over the brutality of Polyphemus: > ::‚ÄúOne day, Galatea, spreading her hair for Scylla to comb, heaved a sigh > and said: ‚ÄúYou, dear girl, are pursued by the kind of men you would hardly > consider uncouth, and you can say no to them, as you do, without a second > thought. But consider my case: My father is Nereus; my mother, sea-blue > Doris; and I have a group of sisters who protect me; yet I was unable to > escape the love of a Cyclops without suffering for it,‚Äù and her voice choked > with sobs. The girl wiped away Galatea‚Äôs tears with a hand white as marble > and consoled her, saying, ‚ÄúTell me about it, dearest, don‚Äôt hide your > sorrow- you can trust me.‚Äù (Ovid Book XIII of the Metamorphoses ln 742‚Äì749. > English Translation by Michael Simpson) Within the Polifemo, Galatea transgresses the established gender roles that were rigidly maintained particularly in 17th century Spain. G√≥ngora places Galatea in a much different light by having her assume a more sexually assertive role. Her shamelessly unrestrained behavior is distinct. Midway through the poem, there is a reversal between the role of the lover (Galatea) and the beloved (Acis). This inversion of the courtly poetry popular in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance in which women were confined to the role of the humble, reticent and inactive role of the beloved spars with the expectations of the 17th century reader. Despite the sexual overtones of the poem, the Bucolic environment captures the Adamic or Pre-fall Edenic innocence of Western tradition, which effectively predicates the licentious and exploitative associations with human sexuality. In this sense, the poem escapes the regular criticism so prevalent in G√≥ngora's time. The bucolic genre effectively bypassed the social formalities, norms, taboos and concerns of posterior civilization. Physical consummation of the lovers Ovid is not so suggestive and does not note whether or not the love was consummated. Meanwhile, G√≥ngora makes this evident and limits the ambiguity of the extent of the brief relationship and by doing so Galatea substantiates her latent sexuality. Temporal differences in the narrative Ovid presents the tale as a recollection and incorporates it into other mythological accounts of transformation. His rendering of the tale portrays the act as something already experienced. As stated by Leher, ‚ÄúG√≥ngora is not interested in this story for the same reason as Ovid. G√≥ngora was interested in this particular story for the contrasts, tensions, and resolutions of the forces which it offered, and his innovations and alterations were directed toward that purpose.‚ÄùLehrer 35 In sum, G√≥ngora seeks to recreate the experience in order to capture the full aesthetic potential provided by the background narrative. Other narrative differences The eloquence of Polifemo's words as he serenades Galatea is particular to G√≥ngora, which contrasts sharply with the grotesque and humorous classical portrayals of the barbarous Cyclops. G√≥ngora chooses to exclude the image of the Cyclops raking (i.e. combing) his hair and other instances in which scrupulous attention is given to his physical appearance. In Ovid, this was used likewise for a humorous effect, which was inappropriate for the graver tone set by G√≥ngora. There are several comedic elements to the ancient texts that were selectively discarded by G√≥ngora. A noticeable difference is in the discovery of the lovers. While in Ovid, the Cyclops stumbles upon them while he is roaming the countryside, G√≥ngora has the discovery interrupt the song of the Cyclops as he is lamenting. As Lehrer goes on to state in her mythological analysis of the Polifemo, ‚Äúinterruption of a speaker is in fact a motif that occurs in G√≥ngora‚Äôs Soledad Primera and suggests displacement and alienation. The interruption of Polifemo‚Äôs song resembles a ‚Äújog in timing which hastens the denouement of the poem.‚Äù Thus, while it does not deviate from the unfolding of the plot, it definitely elicits an aesthetic effect not present in its Roman predecessor.  The Polifemo and the Renaissance ideal  The question of perfection, of a harmonious situation where nothing can be added without worsening conditions for individuals and set relationships, drives the narrative of the Polifemo. Essentially, the poem exposits the implausibility of Arcadia, of an ideal world, given the persistent problem of evil. It presents evil not as an unjustified primordial element independent of humankind, but as a corollary to the finite nature of the material universe. The zero-sum metaphysical assumptions maintained throughout the narrative foment a pervasive sense of competition that prompt egocentric feelings of vanity and jealousy, which together predicate violence and destruction. At the same time, the Polifemo could be interpreted analogically as a commentary of the aesthetic and ethical systems of Gongora's time and place. Beauty itself as a pleasurable distinction amid a multitude of phenomena can only be made sensible through the necessary existence of the outlying inferior qualities or distinct forms surrounding the object in focus. Beauty as a focused pursuit is reflected in the clear background-foreground distinctions characterizing Renaissance painting. By its scarce and exclusive nature, beauty becomes the unending pursuit or focus endowing the aspirant pursuer with a sense of purpose and meaning. These underlying values are reflected in the prevailing themes of Renaissance literature, particularly intangible beauty and harmonious idealization. Presupposing the belief that the world resumes under a cyclic progression of infinite transformation, as propounded in the Metamorphoses of Ovid, the situation that originally gives rise to feelings such as love is likewise just as ephemeral or predisposed to change. Within the narrative, tension develops between this intractable and predetermined outlook characterizing Neo-Platonic thought and that of free will, personal accountability and the uniqueness of individual experiences. The very self- contained and immutable reality of things propounded during the height of the Renaissance, in which entities remained suspended in their particular web of semblances and associations, is portrayed as a specious and unavailing contraption or constraining dogma that thoroughly undermines Immanence and the Present by denigrating the very sensibility of phenomena. The poem has anti- intellectual undertones and seems to idealize pagan love as a contrast to both Polifemo's unavailing lamentations that mirror the courtly love poetry popular throughout both Medieval Christendom and the Early Renaissance in addition to the reemerging Platonic strains of thought. In the Polifemo, the Arcadian world of bucolic poetry proves just as insecure as our own. The world, as the subject experiences it, remains exposed to an array of hostile outside influences that impinge upon our most gratifying experiences. Whether through a direct or indirect capacity, the exterior world inevitably prompts a change in the present arrangement in the very same manner that originally allowed for the conditions at hand. Essentially, life as a continuum of contingent experiences reflects the doctrine of Heracletan flux that greatly influenced the course of Western philosophy. This outlook begs on the part of the subject a reorientation of all outlying perceptions and ultimately renders all teleological equilibria as purely theoretical conceptions. In the midst of flux, the subject is made a victim of his or her circumstance. The Polifemo reflects a change in the aesthetic and philosophical perceptions of 17th- century Europe. Though the poem does offer a critique of former metaphysical and artistic outlooks, the poem is thoroughly distinct in form. The aesthetic focus, for example, shifts towards the sublime and perhaps this is the most palpable distinction. The poetic style also reflects the prevalent sense of anxiety characterizing both the Baroque period and the historical context of the Counter-Reformation. The liberal use of hyperbaton, antithesis, arcane classical allusions, abstruse metaphors and intricate witticisms mark a genuine distinction from Renaissance poetry (see Euphuism, Culteranismo, Marinismo, Pr√©ciosit√©). During this period, there seems to be an unprecedented focus on artistic form, which is a rather modern preoccupation. The injustice experienced on a personal level, of change and of loss, offers a different rendition of what is theorized on the plane of remote abstraction. This is perhaps one reason that can explain the anti-intellectual tone maintained throughout the poem. In the face of destruction and suffering, Gongora portrays life as being ultimately redeemed by the sensorial experience of life itself. Pleasure is realized in its absence and full appreciation develops as a result of its loss. Thus, beauty and ugliness, tranquility and turmoil allow for one another, making life sensible through their contrasts. What an experience does not entail allows for the intellection of its reality. Consequently, this understanding would in turn merit a deep appreciation for reality and all it entails, particularly during the artistic process. This novel outlook could explain the fixation with contrasts present throughout Gongora's other works. During the early 17th century, several scientific and cultural breakthroughs were being made that greatly reshaped Western cosmological perceptions. It seems that Gongora's work reflects this period enmeshed in social upheaval, lingering spiritual doubts and a pervasive feeling of instability. In contrast to the courtly poetry of the Renaissance, the love of Acis and Galatea as portrayed by Gongora is grounded in the innocence of physical attraction, something which had been traditionally marginalized throughout the Middle Ages and Early Renaissance. The actual degeneration of pagan sensibility is rooted in the metaphysical hierarchies of Neoplatonism and its populist successor, Christianity. Sensualism in poetry had always been harangued by Church officials particularly during the Renaissance when there was a renewed interest in Pagan culture. This was understandable given that the literature of antiquity clearly possessed a distinctive ethos that at times drastically opposed the rigid moral standards later established by the Church. The Polifemo ultimately represents the redeeming aspect of love as it arises from and is consequently destroyed by the inscrutable primordial chaos that gives form to passion. The poem celebrates Pagan Love as described by Robert Jammes and conversely criticizes the intellectualism that needlessly justifies and consequently stifles erotic love.

Playing career Club Noted for his ability at taking set pieces, Lozanovski signed with South Melbourne in 1997 under Ange Postecoglou, where he would go on to win 2 National Soccer League grand finals in both the 1997-1998, and 1998-1999 seasons. In the 1999 Grand Final against Sydney United, Lozanovski was awarded the prestigious Joe Marston Medal in South Melbourne's 3-2 victory. Lozanovski's success at South Melbourne paved the way for him to link up with fellow Socceroo Mark Rudan at then-2. Bundesliga club Alemannia Aachen. However, his stay at the club would last only 12 games after being embroiled in the 'suitcase affair' corruption scandal in 2001, after financial irregularities arose following both Australian players transfers to the club. After Rudan was briefly arrested by German authorities over the scandal, charges were laid on the clubs treasurer Bernd Krings, who was convicted of financial fraud. Both Lozanovski and Rudan were eventually cleared, with both players departing the club shortly after. Returning home, Lozanovski had stints in South Australia with Adelaide City, Adelaide United, and Western Strikers during the dying years of the National Soccer League. He saw out his career in the Victorian State Leagues with Heidelberg United and Preston Lions respectively, where he retired in 2008. Managerial Following his retirement, Lozanovski immediately took up a head coaching position at Preston Lions. He would go on to briefly coach both Hume City, and his 2013 Grand Final opponents, Bentleigh Greens before joining Northcote City. During the 2012 season at Northcote, Lozanovski was promoted to head coach, following Peter Tsolakis' departure to South Melbourne. In 2013, Lozanovski took Northcote FC to their first ever Victorian Premier League Championship, defeating Bentleigh Greens in which would be the last season of the Victorian Premier League system, before it was re-branded into the National Premier Leagues Victoria.

The 1-36 was first flown in 1979 and a total of 43 were built by the time production was completed in 1982. The Sprite was reportedly still available to customers in 1987, but none were built after 1982. The 1-36 was conceived as a replacement for the One-design competition Schweizer SGS 1-26, when production of that model ended in 1979. The 1-36 was also the last glider model that the company would manufacture. The completion of production of the 1-36 in 1982 marked the end of an era that started in 1930 with the Schweizer SGP 1-1. The SGS 1-36 Sprite was the only glider produced by Schweizer that was given an official marketing name. Design and development By the end of the 1970s the company decided to end manufacture of the SGS 1-26 one-design class sailplane, which had been in production since 1954. The 1-26 had proven the concept and popularity of one-design soaring competition and the company felt that a similar aircraft, but with more performance, would be popular. The prototype SGS 1-36 first flew in August 1979 and the Sprite was certified under type certificate G5EA on 15 October 1980. The first customer delivery was made on 16 October 1980 to Al Freedy of Hinckley Soaring, Schweizer's dealer in Chicago, where it was employed as a rental aircraft. In late 1980 Schweizer had 32 dealers listed and each one was required to order an SGS 1-36. The 1-36 is an all-metal aircraft with a monocoque fuselage. The wing is covered in aluminum sheet and the aircraft's elevator and rudder are fabric covered. The Sprite's wing has balanced top and bottom divebrakes set well aft near the trailing edge. The 1-36 is not equipped for water ballast. The SGS is equipped with a diameter X main wheel. The wheel has a hydraulic brake that is actuated by full application of the spoilers. The pitot tube is installed in the nose air intake, which gives it good protection during ground handling. The static ports are located 14 inches (35.6 cm) aft of the nose and the fuselage sides. Their location provides accurate indicated airspeed above 56 knots (64 mph, 104 km/h) but provide increasing errors below that speed, up to 4.5 knots (5.2 mph, 8.3 km/h) at the stall. Assembly of the 1-36 is accomplished by inserting the wings and installing the main spar pins and fore and aft drag pins. The T-tail has a fixed section and the two horizontal stabilizer and elevator sections are inserted in that and retained with one pin. The elevators and divebrakes hook up automatically on assembly, but the ailerons require the manual insertion of pins. The Sprite was built in two different versions, differing only in main wheel placement. The 1-36 type certificate is currently held by K & L Soaring of Cayuta, New York. K & L Soaring now provides all parts and support for the Schweizer line of sailplanes. Independent flight testing Independent flight testing of the SGS 1-36 was carried out in January 1982 by Dick Johnson and the Dallas Gliding Association and published in the Soaring Society of America's journal, Soaring, in March 1982. The evaluation flights showed that the aircraft has a glide ratio of 31:1 at calibrated airspeed (48 mph, 78 km/h), the same glide ratio claimed by the factory. Measured minimum sink rate was 130 ft/min (2.17 ft/s) at 39 knots (45 mph, 73 km/h). The roll rate at was 6 seconds from 45 degrees to 45 degrees. Flight testing did note that the 1-36 has a tendency to oscillate in pitch while on aero-tow, but this was easily controlled by the pilot with practice. Johnson's flight test evaluation indicated that the 1-36 out-performed the 1-26E by a margin of 45%. The flight test evaluation concluded:  Operational history As a result of the low numbers produced, the 1-36 did not find a following as a one-design competition class, but it remains popular as a club, rental and personal glider. As of November 2017 there were still 29 SGS 1-36s registered in the US and one in Canada. NASA Research Project The Schweizer SGS 1-36 Sprite experimental prototype, registered N502NA, was acquired by NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center at Edwards, California and used for research into controlled, deep-stall conditions at an angle of attack of more than 30 degrees. The Sprite was used for the test program because of its slow speed and the simple aerodynamics of its long unswept wing. Schweizer Aircraft modified the Sprite's horizontal stabilizer to allow it to produce an elevator angle of up to 70 degrees. NASA also modified the Sprite to permit better pilot entry and exit. Radio-controlled-model, ground tests and simulator tests were conducted before manned flight. During September and October 1983 NASA flew the test program with the SGS 1-36, to demonstrate whether a piloted aircraft could be controlled in flight at very high angles of attack. The 1-36 was usually aero-towed to to conduct these test flights. The program results showed that the Sprite could be safely controlled at angles of attack of 30 to 72 degrees and at high rates of descent.

Messenger, and Twitter. It is developed by Jimmy Moore and is designed around the Ajax model with a user interface written in JavaScript. It is the IRC application setup by default on Firefox.  Design  Mibbit's user interface operates entirely within a web browser and does not require installation of any software on the user's computer. Most modern web browsers that support recent versions of JavaScript are supported, including Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, Google Chrome, and Safari. Mobile devices such as the Apple iPhone iPod Touch, and Nokia N800, and other platforms such as the Nintendo Wii are also supported. Unlike typical web-based IRC clients, Mibbit makes use of a client‚Äìserver design model. The user interface is written in HTML and JavaScript using Ajax programming techniques. The client's backend is written completely in Java and operates independently of the web server in a standalone fashion on the Mibbit server. This design differs from web browser component clients such as ChatZilla or Java applet based IRC clients such as PJIRC that operate entirely from within the web browser. It also differs from server-based web proxy IRC clients such as CGI:IRC where all processing takes place on a remote server. Because the client‚Äìserver design allows for a centralized Mibbit client server, Mibbit is able to offer extended functionality which is not present in the standard IRC protocol. Some of these extensions include a channel chat buffer that can be shown to Mibbit clients when they join a channel where another Mibbit user is already present, a notification for other Mibbit users that you are typing a message to them, and distinctive icons that allow identification of the device used with Mibbit such as an iPhone, iPod Touch, Wii, etc. Mibbit supports the webirc (cgiirc) protocol which allows the client to send the user's IP address and hostname to the IRC server. Servers that support webirc allow Mibbit users to appear as regular IRC clients instead of appearing to connect from the mibbit.com domain. If webirc is not used or is unavailable, Mibbit puts the user's hostname in the client's realname field and encodes the user's IP address in hexadecimal and sends it as the ident reply.  Features  The Mibbit client has the ability to connect to multiple IRC servers, including servers that use SSL/TLS, can join multiple channels, and can be configured auto-join often used channels. Mibbit uses the UTF-8 character set by default but can also be configured to use other character sets. It supports nickname tab auto- completion, an input history for each tab accessible with the up/down arrow keys, aliases, user menu commands, and saving of user preferences. Mibbit can parse smilies, links, channels, nicks, and mIRC color codes, and can automatically create thumbnails for image links and URLs. In addition, Mibbit offers an integrated pastebin, an upload service, and can minify URLs. Mibbit also offers typing notification for other Mibbit users, a recent chat buffer for IRC channels when other Mibbit users are already on the channel, and extended whois information with user profiles. Mibbit supports the Google API which allows the client to support a number of Google Services. Mibbit can translate text and conversations on the fly using Google Translate, Mibbit can also display geographic locations using Google Maps and supports viewing of YouTube videos. In addition to the standard client, Mibbit also supports a widget client that can be embedded into a web page. The widget client supports most of the features of the regular client but does not support multiple server connections.  Reception  Mibbit has been praised by CNET and Lifehacker for its ease of use. Drupal administrators use it to add IRC widgets to sites, noting the benefits of its modular design. Mashable suggests Mibbit as an appropriate resource for those new to IRC.  Firefox support  Firefox 3.5 and beyond builds already support Mibbit as the default IRC protocol handler and support for encrypted ircs:// SSL/TLS connections is also included.  Abuse mitigation  Because Mibbit is effectively an IRC proxy it has the potential to be abused or used to evade bans and blocks. This has resulted in the client being banned from accessing some IRC networks and channels. Mibbit now supports DNSBL checking via the DroneBL service as a means to help block access from abusive users and botnets. Mibbit was listed as an open proxy in the DroneBL DNS blacklist in December 2008, and due to a database glitch mistakenly again listed in March 2009. This prevented Mibbit users from connecting to IRC networks that make use of the DroneBL service. Mibbit was added to DroneBL's whitelist to help prevent future service disruptions. On June 19, 2009 it was banned permanently from freenode, and a new officially supported open-source AJAX client was introduced.

Their debut release in 1982 attracted the attention of Phil Collins via a chance meeting with his mother, and was also given a positive review in the Official Genesis Fan Club quarterly magazine. The Neo-Progressive movement Janysium were one of a small number of British bands formed during the early 1980s, including Marillion, Pendragon, IQ, Twelfth Night, Pallas and Mach One, that was associated with the progressive rock revival of that decade, often referred to as the \\"Neo Progressive Rock Movement\\". Initially their sound was likened to progressive bands like Camel and Genesis, although they later experimented with a more updated sound, influenced by current bands at the time such as Duran Duran. Interesting post note: The band got its name from Peter Matuchniak overhearing a conversation about the singer Janis Ian, and interpreting this as Janysium. Line-ups and output During 1981-82 two members joined Janysium, Sean Lewis (keyboards) and Martin Polley (bass guitar), to rehearse and record their first studio sessions. The original members Matuchniak and Strevens remained the core of Janysium throughout, although both abandoned their project with the band when they merged with fellow musicians in Mach One from 1982-85. After the breakup of Mach One, Matuchniak and Strevens resumed writing and recording in late 1985-86 but this time as a duet only. In 1987, they performed as a guest act for Rock Machine (later known as Indus Creed under CBS) in front of 4,000 people at the Rang Bhavan in Bombay, India under the name \\"The Various Artists\\". This followed several months there recording jingles for television advertisements shown nationally on Indian TV. Other projects Matuchniak formed the progressive rock band Evolve IV in 2003, and Strevens played in Still (1990s) and The Noun (2000s). Lewis became a producer/engineer of classical music at Naxos Records. Polley dropped out of music entirely, focusing on publishing books on the history of sports, and is a lecturer at Southampton University.

It is a seasonal live programme which airs only during the summer months with 16 to 21 episodes being produced. The show is presented by Andrea Kiewel.  History  The first ZDF Fernsehgarten was broadcast on 29 June 1986 and was hosted by Ilona Christen who had a trademark of wearing unusual spectacles and a yellow raincoat. On 17 September 2006, Fernsehgarten celebrated its 20th anniversary. In the 2007 season of the ZDF Fernsehgarten was organised in collaboration with the magazine Yam! It was also the first time a school band competition was organised which was an integral part of the programme at this time. On 8 July 2012 a performance by Roland Kaiser was disrupted.http://kurier.at/404 Also, two weeks later people were arrested at the show. At the end of the 2013 summer season by popular demand of viewers it was decided to broadcast ZDF Fernsehgarten throughout the year, this included a new \\"Fernsehgarten on Tour\\". The show is rebranded depending upon the season. Since May 2014 an image description has been provided for the blind and partially sighted. On 29 June 2014 the ZDF Fernsehgarten appeared in the Guinness Book of World Records as the longest running live open-air entertainment show. The programme has run continuously for 28 years. Total airtime to date is 49,507 minutes and 31 seconds and were broadcast live, equivalent to 34 days at a stretch.  ZDF Fernsehgarten on Tour  As a result of the high popularity of ZDF Fernsehgarten, the programme went on tour for the spring and winter Sunday broadcasts of 2014 before returning to the open-air studio in Mainz for the summer. Three winter productions took place in Obertauern, Austria, with a fourth special in Kitzb√ºhel featuring Hansi Hinterseer.

Origin of the term Barbara Tuchman indicates that the term Gugler is derived from the appearance of the knights dressed for winter, wearing pointed helmets and cowl-like hoods, Gugle (or G√ºgle) being a Swiss German term for cowl or point. Background During lulls in the Hundred Years War unemployed knights and soldiers of free companies often rampaged and plundered the French countryside until they were again engaged and paid by French or English overlords to do their bidding. De Coucy gathered a mercenary army of such knights to enforce his inheritance rights versus his Habsburg relatives. The French king Charles V encouraged and financed de Coucy as he hoped to move these free companies off French lands. There is disagreement about the size of the army De Coucy put together, Tuchman estimates them to be a force of about 10,000 men, a contemporary Alsacian document names 16,000, and other writings place the numbers much higher. As the army was plundering in groups it may not have presented a unified entity. De Coucy's plan was to gain the Sundgau, Breisgau and the county of Ferrette. According to a treaty they had belonged to his Habsburg mother Catherine of Bohemia but were retained by her former brothers- in-law, Albrecht III, Duke of Austria and Leopold III, Duke of Austria. Course The mercenary forces assembled in the Alsace and plundered the Sundgau in October and November 1375. Forty villages were wrecked and people were killed or raped. Leopold was unable to defend the Alsace and retreated to Breisach on the Rhine. After Enguerrand's arrival in November some dissension arose about the next course of action. The Alsace had been plundered, winter was approaching, and the knights were unwilling to cross the Rhine. Coucy then led the army south. In December 1375 the Gugler army crossed the Jura mountains, entered the Aare valley and proceeded in three units. Enguerrand de Coucy led the main army that headquartered at the abbey of St. Urban, Jean de Vienne led the second unit and was stationed at the abbey of Gottstatt, and Owain Lawgoch, the leader of the third unit, stayed at the abbey of Fraubrunnen. Some local nobles left their castles and fled to join Leopold, leaving the countryside open to the Guglers. Others resisted, among them Rudolph IV of Nidau, who was killed as the last of the Nidau counts. Resistance was also given by Petermann I von Gr√ºnenberg whose attempt to displace the Guglers from St. Urban was thwarted. The pillage by the roaming Guglers affected the western part of the Aargau, where the towns of Fridau and Altreu were completely destroyed. However the populace of the area organized to strike back and, although outnumbered, were able inflict significant damage at Buttisholz on December 19, where 300 knights were killed. The Bernese subsequently formed a citizen army, killed another 300 Guglers with apparently only minor losses at Ins on Christmas night, and led a decisive attack on the Guglers at the abbey of Fraubrunnen on December 27. Owain barely escaped, but another 800 knights were slain. These setbacks, the cold weather, and the obvious resolve of the Swiss populace, led to the retreat of the Guglers; their main army and Enguerrand were not even involved in any pitched battle along the line of retreat. Aftermath In January 1376 the Guglers dissolved and returned to plunder the French countryside. Enguerrand compromised with Albrecht III in 1387 and received domain over B√ºren and part of the town of Nidau which he lost after only one year to the citizen army of Bern and Solothurn. The successful defense of their lands against foreign invaders helped the local people in strengthening their budding independence. They confirmed, after their previous successes at the battles of Morgarten (1315) and Laupen (1329), that well organized armies of common men could defeat knightly armour, a feat they would repeat a decade later at Sempach on their route to Swiss independence. The engagements of the Gugler War showed that the epoch of the medieval knight was coming to a close. When questioned by the chronicler Froissart many years later, Enguerrand de Coucy flatly denied he had been in Switzerland at all.

The Queen laid the foundation stone in 1856 and inaugurated the School's opening on 29 January 1859.

Recording As on his previous album Human Emotions, Coe gave each side of Spectrum VII a theme: side one was called ‚ÄúLand Side‚Äù and side two was christened ‚ÄúOcean Side.‚Äù However, unlike that album, the lyrics on Spectrum VII were breezier and more reflective. The ocean theme is apparent on the LP‚Äôs cover, which displays a shirtless Coe on a tropical beach, and in the music, as Coe had been incorporating Caribbean sounds into his delinquent mix of stone country and southern rock material. This became a bone of contention for Jimmy Buffett, who accused Coe of stealing the melody from his song ‚ÄúChanges in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes\\" for Coe‚Äôs ‚ÄúDivers Do It Deeper,\\" which appeared on the 1978 LP Family Album. \\"I would have sued him,\\" Buffett later said, \\"but I didn't want to give Coe the pleasure of having his name in the paper.\\" Coe replied by writing the insulting \\"Jimmy Buffett, which appeared on Nothing Sacred, an album of explicit material released by mail order in 1978 through the back pages of the biker magazine Easyriders. Spectrum VII contained a note stating \\"Jimmy Buffett doesn't live in Key West anymore,\\" a lyric from the song. A more affable shout out went to Meat Loaf, to whom Coe dedicated the hard rocking ‚ÄúSudden Death‚Äù for ‚Äúbelieving in rock and roll and Ohio boys.‚Äù The ever prolific Coe wrote all ten tracks on the album, with the only co-write being the pleading ‚ÄúFall in Love with You,‚Äù which he composed with Leon Petty and includes an opening vocal part reminiscent of Simon and Garfunkel‚Äôs ‚ÄúMrs. Robinson.‚Äù ‚ÄúOn My Feet Again‚Äô contains the lines ‚ÄúI left my stomach in Houston on some surgeon‚Äôs knife but I slept through it all‚Ä¶‚Äù which alludes to complications from a recent burst appendix. \\"Ocean Side\\" collects four sunny marine-themed songs, including the nautical epic \\"Seven Mile Bridge,\\" which stretches to over seven minutes. \\"Now's the Time (To Fall in Love)\\" and \\"Fairytale Morning\\" also radiate with positive vibes.

The county has an average annual temperature of 10.4 ¬∞C, an average of 2504.6 hours of sunshine per year, and an average of 564 millimeters of precipitation per year.  History  Human activity in Yanchang County can be traced back thousands of years, and the first administrative district in the area arose in 266 AD.  Qingjian Uprising and Communist insurgency  Communist activity in the area began in January 1927, when a Communist Party branch was set up at a high school in the county. On October 14, 1927, party leaders Tang Shu and Xie Zichang lead an uprising called the Qingjian Uprising, which had failed. However, Communist Party activity in the region continued in subsequent years. In the spring of 1932, a communist uprising in the area occurred yet again, and the Communist Party organized militias afterwards. On May 30, 1935, Communist troops successfully took control of the county. Communist forces would retain control of the county during the rest of the Civil War, as well as during the Japanese Invasion of China.  Economy  As of 2018, the county's GDP was 5.408 billion Yuan, an increase of 8.7% from the previous year.

During Mao Zedong's rule, oil production in the county was encouraged.  Wangjiachuan Petroleum Drilling Company  In 1985, the county established its own oil company, called Wangjiachuan Petroleum Drilling Company. The company was run by the county government, the first oil company in China to be structured as such. The company dug its first well on May 29, 1985, and produced 1,005 tons of crude oil by the end of the year. By the late 1990s, the company's output hovered at around 14,000 tons per year. In 2000, the county government launched reforms meant to boost its productivity, and in 2005 the company had merged into the Yanchang Oilfield Company Ltd.  Present-Day Situation  After merging into Yanchang Oilfield, the county's oil production further expanded, achieving a stable annual output of approximately 250,000 tons from 2005 through 2010. The county now has three oil production plants, which combine for an annual output in excess of 600,000 tons. = Coal = The county has coal reserves of 20.92 million tons. = Natural Gas = The county's natural gas reserves total 2,000 square kilometers in area, and 100 billion cubic meters in volume. = Salt = The county's salt reserves total 4.838 billion tons.

Pruter was raised in a Lutheran church and served as a Congregationalist minister under the name of Hugo Rehling Pruter, Sr., from 1945 to 1958. In the Congregationalist Church, he was one of the leaders of the liturgical movement in the church during the late 1940s and early 1950s. He was also an opponent of the merger of the Congregational Christian Churches with the Evangelical and Reformed Church to form the United Church of Christ, begun in 1957 and concluded in 1961. As a continuing Congregationalist, he led his church and several other Midwest Congregational churches to reject the merger and form a new body, the Central Association of Congregational Christian Churches. In the late 1960s, Pruter became involved in the Free Catholic Movement, an association that lasted until his death. Pruter's introduction to the Free Catholic Movement and Old Catholicism came in 1963, when he traveled to Europe, where he met several leaders of the Old Catholic tradition. When he returned to the United States, he settled in Boston hoping to find an available church or bishop. Not finding any, he arranged with Archbishop Peter A. Zurawetsky to start a new church in the Back Bay area of Boston, which stressed the contemplative life, mysticism, and a faith based on personal experience. Pruter was consecrated as bishop of the Diocese of Boston by Archbishops Peter A. Zurawetsky and Uladyslau Ryzy-Ryski in 1967. The following year, Pruter designated his diocese an independent communion. After a meeting the following year, the new Christ Catholic Church (Pruter) was recognized when its constitution and canons were given to it by Archbishop Zurawetsky. Pruter was a vigorous publisher and distributor of literature in his fields of interest. The press he founded, St. Willibrord Press, was a major distributor of literature about Old Catholicism. He wrote a number of tracts and pamphlets, as well as books such as The Teachings of the Great Mystics and A History of the Old Catholic Church. He also operated the Tsali Bookstore, specializing in American Indian literature, and Cathedral Books which emphasizes literature about the topic of peace. In his later years Pruter made his home in Highlandville, Missouri. He gained notice for Christ Catholic Church when he converted a small wash-house near the east site of his home there into a chapel. Since the official chapel of a bishop is technically designated as a \\"cathedral\\" the structure was featured for decades in the Guinness Book of World Records as \\"The World's Smallest Cathedral\\". The structure in later years featured a small blue copola, small stained glass window, and three rows of pews about five feet across. Pruter died on 18 November 2007.  Books by Pruter  *Pruter, Karl.

Pruter died on November 18, 2007. There are several remnants of Christ Catholic Church of the Americas and Europe throughout the world and each of them in their own distinct way are connected with Archbishop Karl Hugo Rehling Pruter‚Äôs lifelong ministry within the Old Catholic Movement, but perhaps the most closely related is that of Christ Catholic Church Archdiocese of the Prince of Peace. The church formally began in 1968 after Pruter, who had been consecrated a bishop the previous year, had his new church formally recognized and designated an independent body by Archbishop Peter A. Zurawetsky. The church holds the principles of the Old Catholic churches. It embraces the Christian Holy Scriptures, the creeds of the seven ecumenical councils, and the Confession of Utrecht. It recognizes that the right of private judgement on matters of doctrine lies both with the laity and clergy. However, it retains the right to deprive any of its clergy who adhere to heterodox beliefs of clerical recognition by the church's Presiding Bishop. Liturgically, it uses a vernacular Mass, The Christ Catholic Mass. In his position as bishop, Pruter regularly spoke out for peace and against abortion. The headquarters of the church moved over time, from Boston to New Hampshire, where it has a mission, to Scottsdale, Arizona and finally to Highlandville, Missouri. There, Pruter served as the pastor of the Cathedral of the Prince of Peace, a chapel which has been described as being the smallest cathedral in the world. While in Missouri, Pruter helped establish a small monastic religious community (Good Shepherd Monastery) dedicated to a quiet life of prayer and work, and consecrated its abbot (E.W. Blain) a bishop. Prior to his death in 2007, Pruter entrusted his ministry at the Cathedral of the Prince of Peace to Bishop Brian E. Brown, a bishop of Christ Catholic Church Archdiocese of the Prince of Peace, whom he had consecrated sub-conditionally on September 9 of that same year. At one time the Christ Catholic Church claimed 165 members in six parishes, located in Biddeford, Maine, Kingston, Rhode Island, Chicago, Aurora, Illinois, and Scottsdale, Arizona.

He was one of the original artists for the National Film Board for whom he worked for many years before launching a successful freelancing career. His cartoon character Jasper the Bear was famous throughout Canada from 1948 to 1972 and remains as the mascot of Jasper National Park. Youth James Simpkins' father, Arthur, was proofreader for a Winnipeg newspaper and his mother, Mary, looked after the family which included James and his two older brothers. He attended Luxton public school and began by drawing in his school books. He attended the Winnipeg School of Art and studied under Group of Seven artist LeMoine FitzGerald. Career His professional life began by contributing to the Hudson's Bay's company magazine and submitting cartoons to Macleans. He was drafted into the army in World War II, but was still able to continue to make use of his artistic skills. He was with the Signal Corps security and intelligence group producing training posters and film strips. He recounted that during this period, on a trip to New York for training with the U.S. Signal Corps, he met Charles Addams who had just begun to sell cartoons to The New Yorker. After the war, he became one of the original animators of the National Film Board in Ottawa where he worked for 16 years. In 1948 he began a regular cartoon feature for Maclean's magazine, Jasper the Bear, which would prove to be his most famous and enduring creation. In 1955, Simpkins provided the artwork for a 5¬¢ Canadian stamp which was the idea of Canadian hockey great and member of parliament Lionel Conacher. The stamp featured three Canadian hockey players in action. On August 6, 1962, while living in Beaconsfield, Montreal he began a thrice-weekly cartoon feature for the Montreal Gazette called Simpkins' Montreal. He eventually moved to Toronto where he continued freelancing to the Toronto Star, ad agencies, book illustration, and numerous magazines in Canada and the US. His clients have included General Motors, The National Enquirer and Jasper the Bear has been used by the Boy Scouts of Canada and Jasper National Park. He had five collections of his cartoons published in book form. Four collections of his Jasper cartoons and also his medical cartoons from The Medical Post, When's The Last Time You Cleaned Your Navel?, were published. He also provided the illustrations for other writers' books, most frequently for Canadian humourist Eric Nicol. Jasper the bear His most famous creation was the cartoon Jasper the Bear which appeared in Maclean's magazine for over 20 years and became popular across Canada. The character first appeared in the November 15, 1948 issue and ran as a regular feature until 1968. It was then syndicated by Canada Wide Features running in newspapers across Canada for four more years until Simpkins retired in 1972. Jasper was also featured in several books. Simpkins' anthropomorphic Jasper was an urbane, friendly bear with a wife and two cubs. A typical jasper cartoon involved a hibernating Jasper being woken by a golf ball flying into the den and hitting him in the head. Jasper, happily calls out to his sleeping family, \\"Wake up, everyone. It's spring.\\" On another occasion, Jasper approached a beehive cup in hand saying to the swarm, \\"Could I borrow a cup of honey?\\" In 1962 Jasper was adopted as the official mascot for Jasper National Park in Alberta erecting a statue of Jasper at the train station. Jasper cartoons were also reprinted internationally in England, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and Mexico. In the 1960s Jasper's copyright was sold to Irwin Toys who produced a line of Jasper toys. In 1968 Jasper was used as the official mascot of the charity The United Appeal. As part of their fundraising campaign, Jasper visited various locations including Parliament Hill in Ottawa. This larger-than-life Jasper, a live person in a costume, had his picture taken hugging Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. In 1968 a seven-year-old Ottawa boy was being sent to Boston's Children's Hospital Medical Centre for corrective heart surgery paid for by private charity. In a gesture of encouragement Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau gave the boy a picture with the words \\"A thousand best wishes\\". It was a picture of the Prime Minister with Jasper the Bear. In 2004 vandals damaged a statue of Jasper the Bear which had been a local landmark for 40 years, but the statue was replaced and moved to a more secure location 160m due north of the Jasper Information Centre. The Mayor of Jasper was quoted as saying that vandalism is not unknown to the area, but until now, \\"not to poor ol' Jasper\\". Jasper continues as a promotional tool of Jasper tourism. Having one's picture taken with the statue of Jasper is still a must-have photo when visiting Jasper and, keeping up with the times, Jasper is even on Twitter. In 2005, in celebration of Alberta's centennial, a Jasper the Bear coin was issued. note:picture of coin. Personal life James Simpkins was married to Ethel Mary Thom who died in 2001. They had five children and at the time of his death he had ten grandchildren and seven great grandchildren. Simpkins died on February 1, 2004, at the age of 93, in Dundas, Ontario. Canadian cartoonists have argued that Simpkins has failed to fully get the recognition he deserves. For example, despite his major contribution to Maclean's Magazine, they neglected to mention him or Jasper in their anniversary issue.

It is considered one of the most important works of 20th century aesthetics in the analytic tradition. Originally published in 1968, it was revised in 1976. Goodman continued to refine and update these theories in essay form for the rest of his career.  A general theory of symbols  Languages of Art ostensibly concerns only the philosophy of art, but in the book's introduction, Goodman says that by the \\"languages\\" in the book's title, he means \\"symbol systems\\" in general. Central to the book's thesis is the concept of reference.  Resemblance vs. representation  In the first section of the book, Goodman demonstrates the absurdity of the common assumption that something must resemble another thing to represent it. He does by appealing both to common sense and to mathematical relation theory. Instead, he suggests that representation be seen as a particular type of arbitrary denotation.  Denotation vs. exemplification  Denotation and exemplification are both types of reference. Goodman calls denotation the \\"core of representation.\\" (5) Something is denoted when it is referred to by a label but does not \\"possess\\" it. Exemplification is possession plus reference. \\"While anything may be denoted, only labels may be exemplified.\\" (57)  Authenticity: autographic vs. allographic  In this section of the book, Goodman calls attention to a peculiar problem in the philosophy of art: why is it that a painting can be forged while a piece of music cannot? After verifying that there is indeed an important aesthetic difference between an original and a forgery and clarifying its nature, Goodman suggests an answer to the question. His answer is that works in a form of art can be forged if and only if (\\"iff\\") there is no possible notation to specify which are and are not authentic works. In other words, a piece of music can be written down as a score, so any performance which corresponds suitably to the score is counted as authentic; there is no such notation to define what is and what isn't an authentic instance of a painting, so a painting can be forged.  Theory of notation  In this, the key section of the book, Goodman expands on his idea of a notational system introduced in the previous chapter. For Goodman, a symbol system is a formal language with a grammar consisting of syntactic rules and semantics rules. A symbol system is called notational if it meets certain properties, notably that its symbols are non-compact.  Score, sketch and script  Goodman evaluates the common notational methods of musical and theatrical performance, drawing and painting, dance and architecture. None of the art forms adhere to his ideal notation, but they are nonetheless sufficient for their purpose. Despite the critiques Goodman makes of the common vocabulary of art discussion, he does not believe that, \\"the exigencies that dictate technical discourse need govern our everyday speech.\\" (187)  References  * Goodman, Nelson.

The VEGA browser is based on Ensembl web code and infrastructure and provides a public curation of known vertebrate genes for the scientific community. The VEGA website is updated frequently to maintain the most current information about vertebrate genomes and attempts to present consistently high-quality annotation of all its published vertebrate genomes or genome regions. VEGA was developed by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and is in close association with other annotation databases, such as ZFIN (The Zebrafish Information Network), the Havana Group and GenBank. Manual annotation is currently more accurate at identifying splice variants, pseudogenes, polyadenylation features, non-coding regions and complex gene arrangements than automated methods. History The Vertebrate Genome Annotation (VEGA) database was first made public in 2004 by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. It was designed to view manual annotations of human, mouse and zebrafish genomic sequences, and it is the central cache for genome sequencing centers to deposit their annotation of human chromosomes. Manual annotation of genomic data is extremely valuable to produce an accurate reference gene set but is expensive compared with automatic methods and so has been limited to model organisms. Annotation tools that have been developed at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI) are now being used to fill that gap, as they can be used remotely and so open up viable community annotation collaborations. The HAVANA and VEGA Projects were run by Dr. Jennifer Harrow of the Wellcome Sanger Institute. VEGA has been archived since February 2017 and the HAVANA team moved to EMBL-EBI in June 2017. Human genome The Vega database is the central repository for the majority of genome sequencing centers to deposit their annotation of human chromosomes. Since the original VEGA publication, the number of human gene loci annotated has more than doubled to over 49,000 (September 2012 release), over 20,000 of which are predicted to be protein coding. The Havana Group as part of the consensus-coding sequence (CCDS) collaboration and whole-genome extension of the ENCODE project have fully manually annotated the human genome‚Äîwhich is available for reference, comparative analysis and sequence searches on the VEGA database. The final VEGA release was in February 2017 (release 68) and VEGA is now an archived site that will no longer be updated. Other vertebrates The VEGA database combines the information from individual vertebrate genome databases and brings them all together to allow easier access and comparative analysis for researchers. The human and vertebrate analysis and annotation (Havana) team at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI) manually annotate the human, mouse and zebrafish genomes using the Otterlace/ZMap genome annotation tool. The Otterlace manual annotation system comprises a relational database that stores manual annotation data and supports the graphical interface, Zmap and is based on the Ensembl schema. Zebrafish The Zebrafish Genome, which is being fully sequenced and manually annotated. The Zebrafish genome currently has 18,454 annotated VEGA genes--of which, 16,588 are projected protein-coding genes (September 2012, release). Mouse The Mouse genome currently has 23,322 annotated VEGA genes--of which, 14,805 are projected protein-coding genes (June 2012, release). The loci chosen for manual annotation are spread throughout the genome, but some regions have received more focus than others: Chromosomes 2, 4, 11 and X, which have been fully annotated. The annotation shown in this release of Vega is from a datafreeze taken on 19 March 2012 and the gene structures are presented in the merged mouse geneset shown in Ensembl release 67. Vega also shows artificial loci generated by the mouse Knockout programs. Pig The Pig genome currently has annotated 2,842 VEGA genes-- of which, 2,264 are projected protein-coding genes (September 2012, release). The pig major histocompatibility complex (MHC), also known as the swine leukocyte antigen complex (SLA), spans a 2.4Mb region of submetacentric chromosome 7 (SSC7p1.1-q1.1). Implicated in the control of immune response and susceptibility to a range of diseases, the pig MHC plays a unique role in histocompatibility. Chromosomes X-WTSI and Y-WTSI are currently being annotated by Havana. Dog, chimpanzee, wallaby, and gorilla The Dog genome currently has 45 annotated VEGA genes--of which, 29 are projected protein-coding genes (February 2005, release). The Chimpanzee genome currently has 124 annotated VEGA genes--of which, 52 are projected protein-coding genes (January 2012, release). The Wallaby genome currently has 193 annotated VEGA genes--of which, 76 are projected protein-coding genes (March 2009, release). The Gorilla genome currently has 324 annotated VEGA genes--of which, 176 are projected protein-coding genes (March 2009, release). Comparative analysis In addition to full genomes, and unlike other browsers, VEGA also displays small finished regions of interest from genomes of other vertebrates, human haplotypes and mouse strains. Currently this comprises the finished sequence and annotation of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) from different human haplotypes, and dog and pig [the latter of which is currently otherwise only available in very limited form in Ensembl Pre!. Additionally there is mouse NOD (non-obese diabetes) strain annotation of IDD (insulin-dependent diabetes) candidate regions and two more pig regions. Vega contains comparative pairwise analysis between specific genomic regions from either different species or from different haplotypes / strains. This is in contrast to Ensembl where many all genome versus all genome comparisons are performed. The analysis in Vega involves: 1\\\\. The identification of genomic alignments using LastZ. 2\\\\. Prediction of the orthologue pairs using the Ensembl gene tree pipeline. Note that although the pipeline generates phylogenetic genetrees, the limited scope of the Vega comparative analysis means that these will necessarily be incomplete and consequently only orthologs are shown on the website. 3\\\\. The manual identification of alleles in either different human haplotypes or mouse strains. There are five sets of analyses: 1\\\\.

At Jena he was responsible for the establishment of an anatomical theatre and an Accouchierhaus (maternity house). In 1780-81, at the expense of the Duke of Weimar, he took a scientific journey to France, England and Holland, a trip in which he made the acquaintance of several well-known physicians and scientists -- Louis-Jean- Marie Daubenton, Jean-Louis Baudelocque, F√©lix Vicq-d'Azyr and John Hunter, among others.ADB:Loder, Justus Christian von @ Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie In 1803 he transferred to the University of Halle, where he established a clinic of obstetrics.

Later he relocated to Russia, where in 1810 he became personal physician to Czar Alexander I. Between 1814 and 1817 he was in charge of the military hospital in Moscow. He died in Moscow on 16 April 1832. From 1794 to 1803 he published Tabulae anatomicae, which was a masterpiece containing a complete collection of anatomical illustrations of the human body.

These peaks can occur in the NMR spectrum of any NMR active atom (e.g. 19F or 31P NMR) where those atoms adjoin a carbon atom (and where the spectrum is not 13C-decoupled, which is usually the case). However, Carbon satellites are most often encountered in proton NMR. In the example of proton NMR, these peaks are not the result of proton-proton coupling, but result from the coupling of 1H atoms to an adjoining 13C atom. These small peaks are known as carbon satellites as they are small and appear around the main 1H peak i.e. satellite (around) to them. Carbon satellites are small because 13C only makes up about 1% of the atomic carbon content of carbon, the rest of the carbon atoms are predominantly NMR inactive 12C. Carbon satellites always appear as an evenly spaced pair around the main 1H peak. This is because they are the result of 1% of the 1H atoms coupling to an adjoined 13C atom to give a wide doublet (13C has a spin of a half). Note, if the main 1H-peak has proton-proton coupling, then each satellite will be a miniature version of the main peak and will also show this 1H-coupling, e.g. if the main 1H-peak is a doublet, then the carbon satellites will appear as miniature doublets, i.e. one doublet on either side of the main 1H-peak. For other NMR atoms (e.g. 19F or 31P atoms), the same applies as above, but obviously where the proton atom is replaced with that other NMR active atom e.g. 31P. Sometime other peaks can be seen around 1H peaks, these are known as spinning sidebands and are related to the rate of spin of an NMR tube. Carbon satellites (and spinning sidebands) should not be confused with impurity peaks. Uses Cis- Stilbene Trans-Stilbene Carbon satellites can be used to obtain structural information, which is not available by looking at the main peaks in the NMR spectrum. This usually occurs when the purely 12C compound is symmetrical but where the 1% of the compound which has a 13C atom in it is no longer symmetrical. For example, you can not tell if stilbene (Ph-CH=CH-Ph) has a cis- or trans- double bond just by examining at the main peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum. The =CH- proton does not couple to the adjacent =CH- proton as the molecule is symmetrical. However 1% of the stilbene molecules will have a 13C atom on one of these double bond carbons (i.e. Ph-13CH=12CH-Ph). In this situation, the proton adjacent to 13C atom will couple to the 13C atom to give a wide doublet. Also, as this molecule is no longer symmetric the 13C _H_ = proton will now couple to the adjacent 12C _H_ = proton, causing a further doubleting. Thus this additional coupling (additional to the 13C coupling) is diagnostic of the type of double bond, and will allow one to determine if the stilbene molecule has a cis- or trans- configuration i.e. by examining the size of the diagnostic J coupling constant from -CH=CH- bond. Thus only a single 1H NMR spectrum is needed, albeit with close inspection of the satellite peaks, rather than any further complex NMR or derivative chemical experiments.

In January 2019, PV-Wave parent Rogue Wave Software was acquired by Minneapolis, Minnesota-based application software developer Perforce. History PV-WAVE was originally developed by a company called Precision Visuals, based in Boulder, CO. In 1992, the IMSL Numerical Libraries and Precision Visuals merged and the new company was renamed Visual Numerics. PV-WAVE is closely related to the IDL (programming language), from whose code-base PV-WAVE originated. The shared history of PV-WAVE and IDL began in 1988, when Precision Visuals entered into an agreement with Research Systems, Incorporated (RSI, the original developer of IDL) under which Precision Visuals resold IDL under the name PV-WAVE. In September 1990, Precision Visuals exercised an option in its agreement with RSI to purchase a copy of the IDL source code. Since that time, IDL and PV-WAVE have been on separate development tracks: each product has been enhanced, supported, and maintained separately by its respective company. In May 2009, Visual Numerics was acquired by Rogue Wave Software. In January 2019, Rogue Wave Software was acquired by Minneapolis, Minnesota-based application software developer Perforce.

He is the son of Stan and Ariel Rogers. His father, a folk musician and songwriter, died in a fire aboard Air Canada Flight 797 on June 2, 1983. Rogers was immersed in the songwriting tradition from an early age, gaining a keen appreciation for singers and songwriters like Joni Mitchell, Gordon Lightfoot and Leonard Cohen. Early musical experience consisted of singing in school choirs and plays. While attending the boarding school Appleby College in Oakville, Rogers worked with the Appleby Boys Choir, a world-class boys choir, occasionally touring as far afield as New Orleans. Rogers completed his high school education at Westdale Secondary School in 1997 and moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1998. Rogers worked with Mitch Podolak on the World Next Door Festival then stayed in Winnipeg to pursue a degree in Religious Studies. In 2004, Rogers approached Rick Fenton to produce his debut album, True Stories. Around the time Rogers released True Stories, he began to develop his talent at throat singing. He has since added a stomp box to his shows to provide rhythm and regularly features Mongolian and Tuvan throat singing. Rogers has been to Iqaluit to study Inuit throat singing and to teach the Tuvan styles. In 2009, Rogers released his second album, The Gauntlet. The album is supported by Fogarty's Cove Music and was released through Borealis Records. In 2010, Rogers was aboard the Clipper Adventurer when she ran aground on an uncharted rock in Coronation Gulf, Northwest Territories. More recently, Rogers has teamed up with Leonard Podolak and JD Edwards to create a new folk music power trio called Dry Bones. In 2011, they released the band's first self-titled CD. In 2017, American blues and Americana artist Watermelon Slim recorded a CD titled Golden Boy in Winnipeg, Scott Nolan producing, that included an a cappella version of Stan Rogers' \\"Barretts Privateers.\\" Nathan Rogers honored Slim by being part of the men's singing group backing him in this recording.

Lope √ç√±iguez (c. 1050 ‚Äì 1093) succeeded his father √ç√±igo L√≥pez to become the second Lord of Biscay in 1076. √ç√±igo died shortly after the assassination of his overlord Sancho IV of Navarre and the subsequent takeover of Biscay, √Ålava, part of Guip√∫zcoa and La Rioja by Alfonso VI of Castile. He accepted Alfonso as his lord and his son followed suit, although after √ç√±igo's death the tenencia of N√°jera, the most important in La Rioja, which he had held was given to Garc√≠a Ord√≥√±ez, husband of Urraca, sister of the deceased Navarrese king. Nevertheless, it was Lope and Diego √Ålvarez de Oca whom the king had swear to uphold and guarantee the fuero of N√°jera which he had granted (1076). For the loss of N√°jera, Lope was compensated with the tenencias of √Ålava (1081) and Guip√∫zcoa (1082) and he was thus the first to unite the Basque provinces under one lord. The first record of his simultaneous rule in all three provinces comes from a charter of donation he made to the monastery of San Mill√°n de la Cogolla in 1082, which he signed as \\"I, lord Lope √ç√±iguez, governing Biscay, Guip√∫zcoa and √Ålava\\".Ego senior Lope Enneconis dominante Bizcaia et Ipuzcoa et Alaba. The title senior (modern Spanish se√±or) was more typical of Navarrese titulature, whereas the Castilians preferred the form dominus (modern Spanish don). This concentration of political authority led to the suppression of the Diocese of √Ålava and the consignment of its province to the Diocese of Calahorra in 1087. In 1089 Lope received the title of count, the highest rank in the kingdom, from Alfonso.He witnessed a royal diploma as \\"count Don Lope of Biscay\\" (Comite domno Lope Bizcaie). Lope's importance continued to grow, for in 1091, at his instigation, Alfonso VI donated the monastery of San Andr√©s de Astigarribia, which lay on the border between Biscay and Guip√∫zcoa, to San Mill√°n. Lope was a regular participant in Alfonso VI's Reconquista.His record indicates he held non grudge against either Alfonso or Garc√≠a for the loss of N√°jera. He probably took part in the conquest of Toledo in 1085. Forces from √Ålava are known to have participated in the Battle of Sagrajas in 1086, probably under his leadership.The source is a notice added in that year to a document of 1080 in the archives of San Mill√°n. The knights Sancho Fort√∫nez and his nephew Sancho Ortiz, both from √Ålava, are known to have been at Sagrajas (Sacralias) north of Badajoz. In the spring of 1092 he probably joined with Garc√≠a Ord√≥√±ez in defending the Rioja from the depredations of the exile and freebooter Rodrigo D√≠az de Vivar. Lope married Ticlo (Tecla) D√≠az, daughter of a certain Diego √Ålvarez, possibly Diego √Ålvarez de Ayala, who ruled Asturias de Santillana,This was the suggestion of Juan Antonio Llorente, based on the numerous donations the couple made in the Valle de Mena, where many of Diego's interests lay. but more probably Diego √Ålvarez de Oca. Their marriage took place before 1079, when the couple made a donation to San Mill√°n. Ticlo may have brought part of Las Encartaciones to Lope, thus uniting them permanently with Biscay. She gave birth to an heir, Diego I, named after her father. The names Diego and Lope would alternate in the heads of the family for generations. Ticlo bore four other children: Sancho, Toda (who married Lope Gonz√°lez, who succeeded Lope in √Ålava), Sancha and Teresa (who married Garc√≠a S√°nchez de Zurbano and later went on a pilgrimage to Rome). Shortly after Lope's death in 1093 Ticlo donated the monastery of Alb√≥niga to San Mill√°n for the good of his soul. She died towards 1104 and was buried in San Mill√°n. Lope may also have been the father of Pedro L√≥pez de Monforte.Barton, 281. Notes References *Simon Barton. The Aristocracy in Twelfth-century Le√≥n and Castile.

Shawano Lake is a hard water drainage lake with multiple inlets and one major outlet, the Wolf River. A dam on the Wolf River located in the City of Shawano raises the water levels of Shawano Lake. Shawano Lake is approximately , with an average depth of approximately and a maximum depth of approximately . The shoreline length is estimated at .Lake Survey Map: Shawano Lake. Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. The Towns of Wescott, and Washington, and the Village of Cecil border Shawano Lake. Activities Shawano Lake is a popular lake for recreational fishing, boating, swimming, water skiing, bird watching, hunting, and other outdoor activities. It is currently a eutrophic lake with elevated levels of algae blooms, nutrients, and nuisance aquatic plants. Aquatic plant management is a major management objective for the lake. Shawano Lake is one of the most heavily fished lakes in the area. It contains many species of fish, including walleye, largemouth bass and panfish in the early season. Ice fisherman concentrate on northern pike and panfish. Fishing tournaments are common on the lake. Two ice racing tracks are used on the lake in the winter. Development Shawano Lake is heavily developed, with dense residential housing surrounding most of the shoreline. It lies within the Shawano Lake Sanitary District, so all dwellings have sanitary sewers and public water supply. There are many resorts and cabin rentals on the lake.Shawano Lake, WI 54166, Community Web Site Fishing and Wildlife Shawano Lake is managed as a warm water fishery. The primary game fish species are northern pike, largemouth bass, and walleye. The predominant panfish are bluegill, black crappie, yellow perch and pumpkinseed.Shawano Lake Watershed (WR15) Good natural reproduction supports the fishery. Over the last ten years a musky population has been established and is maintained by annual stocking. A walleye spawning reef was developed on Shawano Lake in the mid-1980s. Annual fall electrofishing surveys are conducted on the lake to monitor the reproductive success of walleye and largemouth bass, with periodic spring fyke netting surveys conducted to monitor the overall fishery. Shawano Lake is important as a resting stop for migrating waterfowl. Numerous species of wildlife inhabit the undeveloped shoreland areas. Standing dead and dying trees (snags) on the uplands provide habitat for various species of birds and insects, including bald eagles, bats, woodpeckers, and songbirds. Several species of mammals and birds use cavities in trees for dens. Salamanders, small mammals, and invertebrates use downed and rotting logs for protection, feeding and breeding sites. Downed trees in or at the water's edge (woody cover) are especially valuable for resting and feeding areas. Aquatic and wetland vegetation at or near the water's edge provides critical habitat for small mammals, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and fish at all life stages. Lake Access Shawano Lake has about 24 access points, which are a combination of public and private landings and town owned fire lanes. A county park is located on Shawano Lake, with a swimming beach and boat launch. A second park is located within the Village of Cecil, which is used as an access point for one of the ice racing tracks. Shawano Municipal Airport is also located on Shawano Lake and uses part of the lake for a runway. It is frequently used for pontoon plane take-offs and landings during the summer months.

It can be used either to transform pressure into rotational motion (an engine), or the converse - rotational motion into pressure (pump). It is still in development, but has possible applications in fields requiring oil, fuel or water pumps, as well as pumps for non-abrasive fluids when moderate or high pressure is required. For instance: Hydraulics, fluid and gas transport systems, presses, fuel injection, irrigation, heating systems, hydraulic lifts, water jet engines, hydro- and pneumatic engines, and medical pumps.Schapiro, B., \\"The RKM Rotary Piston Maschines\\" In: Vernetzte Wissenschaften, Eds: Peter J√∂rg Plath und Ernst-Christoph Ha√ü, Logos Verlag, Berlin 2008 The machine's inventor is Boris I. Schapiro, along with co- inventors Lev B. Levitin and Naum Kruk. Design All versions of the RKM incorporate a working chamber formed by smoothly conjugated circular arcs. The piston, shaped to conform to the chamber's walls, \\"jumps\\" from wall to wall, thus performing a rotary motion. The piston has an appropriately shaped aperture fitted with a gear structure, and this drives the power shaft (or two power shafts in some models). The piston, its aperture and the working chamber of the RKMs represent, in their cross sections, multi-oval figures which, mathematically, are related to the class of figures of equal width. Those multi-ovals are non-analytical figures with a discontinuous second derivative of the contour line (the curvature). Hence, generally speaking, the trajectories of their centers of curvature are also non-analytical and, within the RKMs' geometry, have to have singular points. In relation to the piston, the trajectory of the power shaft axis has corner points, which correspond to extreme positions of the piston as related to the working chamber. Those corners, which represent singular points of the power shaft's trajectory, cannot be avoided or rounded to provide for the kinematically closed functioning of the gear. The reason why until now the geometry of curves of constant width could not be put to practical use in the gear design is that no conventional gear structure with the regular rolling on of the gears would permit the exact rolling-on of the singularities. The RKMs solve this problem by introducing the inversely conjugated gear system, which makes it possible to have singular trajectories of the axes of rolling-on gears and, thus, allows the transfer of the angular momentum during the passage of the piston through its stop positions.RKM's - Rotating Piston Machines - Scientific and Technical Comments In simple words, the gear mechanism introduces corrections to the piston's motion, correcting the axis of rotation as it leaves the stop positions, so as to create a smooth motion. Possible configurations In theory, there is no limit to the number of \\"sides\\" that a working chamber may have. However, in practice, it is likely that configurations incorporating no more than seven arcs will be used. In addition, there can be either one or two power shafts in the aperture in the center of the piston. Of course, the exact configuration of every model depends upon its use. For instance, internal combustion engines would include injection valves and after-burning chambers. These, however, are not part of the RKM concept. Applications Potential areas of application for the RKM engines include:RKM's - Rotating Piston Machines - Project Summary *Pumps: medium-, high-pressure, and pre-vacuum pumps for use in power machinery, refrigerators, elevators, lifts, cranes, road-building machinery, automobiles, aircraft, and other applications, including those for domestic water and heating systems,and scientific research. *Compressors: medium- and high-pressure compressors for a wide range of industrial and consumer applications. *\\"Cold\\" motors: hydraulic and pneumatic motors for use in automobiles, air-, space- and marine craft, and in a number of other applications in industrial and consumer products. *Power tools: a new class of power tools for drilling, cutting and surface treatment of materials in various ranges (from super-large to micrometre). *Internal and external combustion engines, including Diesel, for all types of wheeled or tracked motor vehicles (from motorbikes to automobiles and trucks, to Mars explorers), marine craft of all sizes (from pleasure boats to supertankers), helicopters and propeller-driven aircraft (including super-light platforms). *Electric power generators for agriculture and industry, including oil and gas production, air & space industry, large stationary and vehicular power generators, compact emergency generators, etc. *Compact sources of electrical power for portable computers and other electronic devices, etc. One area where RKMs offer very high potential is in the pump market. RKM pumps can be as, or more efficient than today's preferred pump technologies, while offering overall advantages in pricing, size, reliability and energy efficiency.Schapiro, B. and Terlitsky, L., \\"The RKM (RKM) Rotary Piston Machines with the Jumping Momentously Axis\\", Proceedings of the International Conference on Sustainable Automotive Technologies 2008 (ICSAT2008), 4th to 9th November 2008 in Melbourne, Australia Comparison to the Wankel engine Despite their apparent geometrical similarity, the RKM and the Wankel engine are quite different in design. The main similarities between them are the shape of the working chamber and the use of rotary motion. However, there are many differences between the two. The Wankel engine working chamber is mobile while the RKM chamber is stationary. The axis of rotation in the Wankel engine moves in a circle while that of the RKM is fixed (in the single power shaft version, temporarily with two possible positions). In the RKM motor, the ignition takes place in a compact recess, while the Wankel's is in the work chamber itself. The RKM's sealing elements are in surface contact with the work chamber and pistons, as opposed to the Wankel's line contact. This makes for a number of advantages of the RKM motor over the Wankel: #Easier adaptation to diesel fuel. #Support of forced afterburning of gases, which is not feasible with the Wankel geometry. #Longer life, lower fuel consumption and higher efficiency. One application that the two may indeed have in common is miniaturization. A miniature Wankel engine has been successfully constructed,Fu, K., Knobloch, A., Cooley, B., Walther, D., Fernandez-Pello, A. C., Liepmann, D., and Miyasaka, K., Microscale Combustion Research for Applications to MEMS Rotary IC Engine, Proc. 2001 National Heat Transfer Conference, Anaheim, CA, June 10‚Äì12, 2001. and it stands to reason that the same can be done for an RKM. Although developed in the 1960s, today there are no runnable RKM engine demonstrated.

In 1949, the consulate was upgraded to a consulate-general. In 1954, Canada recognized and established diplomatic relations with Lebanon. In 1958, both nations opened embassies in each other's capitals, respectively. Between 1975-1990, Lebanon entered into a civil war between various religious factions in the country. In 1985 Canada closed its embassy in Beirut. During the war, Canada received thousands of Lebanese refugees which made Lebanon the largest Arab diaspora community in Canada. Canada re-opened its embassy in Beirut in 1995. There are approximately 190,000 Canadians of Lebanese descent in Canada and 45,000 Canadians residing in Lebanon.

He is most remembered as the inventor of an improved fluid-damped tripod head, for which he won Academy Awards in 1975 and 1992. Early life and education Chadwell O'Connor came from a distinguished family. His father, Johnson O'Connor was a well-known psychometrician and pioneer in the study of aptitude testing. His mother died when he was young and his father remarried the MIT-trained architect and educator Eleanor Manning. The family lived in Boston and O'Connor often accompanied his father to his work at the General Electric factory in Lynn, Massachusetts where he acquired an interest in engineering. O'Connor attended the Stevens Institute of Technology and California Institute of Technology where he earned a degree in mechanical engineering. Shortly after graduating, World War II broke out and O'Connor joined Douglas Aircraft where he was in charge of expediting aircraft production and repair, a vital part of the war effort.Broggie, Michael, Walt Disney's Railroad Story, 2nd ed., pp. 149-50, The Donning Company Publishers, Virginia Beach, VA, 2006. Steam enthusiast Reproduction of Central Pacific No. 60 Jupiter Reproduction of Union Pacific No. 119 The locomotive that Chadwell owend. It is now on display in Jacksonville Oregon. After the war, O'Connor joined Pasadena Power and Light as chief engineer. O'Connor had been interested in steam engines since he was a boy and he applied this knowledge at the power company to improve power production and incineration. In 1974, he used this experience to develop the O'Connor Rotary Combustor that burned municipal garbage to create steam for power generation. The first pilot plant was built in Japan, and in 1980 a production facility was built in Gallatin, Tennessee, that burned 200 tons a day of municipal waste. This technology was spun out of O'Connor's company, O'Connor Engineering, to a separate company that was later purchased by Westinghouse. O'Connor had long been fascinated with steam locomotives which he recognized were a dying breed and began photographing them. He later became involved in the refurbishment and reproduction of classic steam locomotives, and owned a 1891 0-4-0 locomotive from 1952-1967., http://www.southerncalifornialivesteamers.com/Show_Tip.asp?ID=16, http://movie-trains.com/sleroster1/ He and his company, O'Connor Engineering Laboratories, recreated the drawings and reproduced copies of the Union Pacific No. 119 and Central Pacific Jupiter locomotives that met for the driving of the Golden spike at Promontory Summit, Utah. These reproductions are used in recreations of the event and have been operating at the Golden Spike National Historic Site since 10 May 1979.Pentrex, 1997.\\"Colored Steam Locomotives,\\" SteamLocomotive.com (http://www.steamlocomotive.com/colored/ ) Retrieved 8-17-2011.\\"Golden Spike,\\" National Park Service, Dept. of the Interior, Golden Spike National Historic Site, Brigham City, UT (http://www.nps.gov/gosp/historyculture/upload/jupiter%202.pdf), Retrieved 8-17-2011.\\"Union Pacific's 119\\" Golden Spike Pictures (http://users.tns.net/~path/GS119.html), Retrieved 8-17-2011.Gest, Gerald M., Promontory's Locomotives, pp. 12-43, Golden West Books, San Marino, CA, 1980.\\"Central Pacific Jupiter and Union Pacific 119 at Promontory, UT, 6-8-09\\" YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv54hDAvJwk), Retrieved 11/24/11.Dowty, Robert R., Rebirth of the Jupiter and the 119: Building the Replica Locomotives at Golden Spike, pp. 5-46, Southwest Parks & Monuments Ass'n., 1994.\\"Promontory Locomotive Project: Plans for the Jupiter and No. 119,\\" DVD, Western National Parks Ass'n. Disney animator and steam-engine- owner Ward Kimball painted the artwork on the No. 119. In later years, O'Connor maintained his own steamboat which he would fire up and tool around the harbor in Newport Beach, California.Broggie, Michael, Walt Disney's Railroad Story, 2nd ed., pp. 123, 124, 149-50, The Donning Company Publishers, Virginia Beach, VA, 2006. In the 1990s the O'Connors donated one of their steam engines to the Minnesota Transportation Museum for the restoration of the streetcar boat Minnehaha. Minnehaha was brought back into service as a working museum in 1996. Through the O'Connors' generosity people are still able to experience a historic steamboat cruise on Lake Minnetonka, Minnesota, where they can learn about and see a working steam engine.http://www.steamboatminnehaha.org/ The fluid head O'Connor's fascination with photographing steam locomotives led to his best known invention, an improved tripod fluid head with counterbalance and adjustable drag. As he tried photographing moving trains, he became annoyed by the jerkiness of the pictures. To solve this problem he developed a silicone- filled platform that interfaced between the tripod and the camera to allow smooth panning and tilting of the camera. He still viewed this as a hobby and shot more than 100,000 feet of film on the waning days of steam locomotives. One day in 1952, while filming near Glendale, California, he met Walt Disney, who was also a steam enthusiast. Disney was so impressed with the tripod head that he asked if O'Connor could make more for him. O'Connor agreed but said it would take time as he built them in his garage. Disney was then shooting one of his first nature studies, The Living Desert, and needed a way to shoot moving animals smoothly. The O'Connor head was so successful that Disney immediately ordered 10 more. This film won the first Academy Award for Documentary Feature in 1953. O'Connor founded a part-time business in 1952 to make the heads and by 1969 it was so successful that he left the power company to work full-time on camera heads and steam engines at O'Connor Engineering. O'Connor and Disney maintained a lifelong friendship and business relationship. O'Connor designed the power systems for the steam launches and paddlewheelers at Disney World in Florida. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presented O'Connor with a Scientific and Engineering Award (Class II) in 1975 and an Award of Merit in 1992 for the concept and engineering of a fluid-damped camera-head for motion picture photography. In his lifetime, O'Connor received 29 US patents. Death Chadwell O‚ÄôConnor died on September 5, 2007.

The 2008 US beef protest in South Korea was a series of protest demonstrations made between 24 May 2008 and mid August 2008. against president Lee Myung-bak in Seoul, Korea. The protest involved several hundred thousands and at its height up to one million people. The protest began after the South Korean government reversed a ban on US beef imports. The ban had been in place since December 2003, when mad cow disease was detected in US beef cattle. The protests occurred on a background of talks concerning the US-Korea free trade agreement. Critics accuse the move as an attempt by the Korean government to please the US government. Local media also criticized the government's attempt. An example of this is the Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation (MBC) PD Notebook program \\"Is American Beef Really Safe from Mad Cow Disease?\\" televised on 27 April 2008. Lee Myung-bak's popularity plummeted after the decision and protests.  Background  South Korea was once the third-largest importer of US beef. This changed when in 2003 mad-cow disease, specifically the prion responsible for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), was detected in US beef. Imports were then halted. In 2008, the then new Lee Myung-bak government agreed, after extensive negotiations, to restart imports. That decision set off a firestorm of controversy, leading hundreds of thousands of citizens to come out in the spring and early summer of 2008 in protest over the resumed imports and against the corrupt chaebol government. Media reports, public networks, and PD Notebook uncovered the new president's policies to be putting South Koreans' health at risk of contracting mad cow disease. The deal has sparked public outrage for exposing the country to a higher risk of mad cow disease.https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/30/world/asia/30korea.html?_r=0 Natively referred to as the \\"Million Citizen Protests,\\" the events comprised nation's largest anti-government movement in two decades, drawing hundreds of thousands of citizens daily and 1,700 civic groups over a span of three months.

Elise Yoon, \\"Largest Crowd in Anti-Lee Myung-Bak Protests\\" The Seoul Times. Origin of the protest 2003 On 23 December 2003, a first case of BSE in the US was found in Washington state. The Holstein cow had been imported from Canada in 2001. On 9 December the 6.5-year-old cow was slaughtered. The cow was a \\"downer\\" (a cow that is unable to walk). For that reason, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) was automatically notified; and the cow was examined before and after its death by a government vet. The veterinarian determined that the cow was suffering from complications of calving. Samples of tissue were taken for further testing for BSE. Parts of the cow with a high risk of transmitting the BSE prion were removed but may have been sent for \\"inedible rendering\\" into food for non-ruminant animals. The carcass itself was allowed to continue on for further processing into human food at other facilities. On 23 December 2003 when tests proved positive for BSE, a recall was made. The contaminated meat had not entered the commercial market. Offspring of the cow were destroyed. \\"Bovine spongiform encephalopathy in a dairy cow ‚Äì Washington State, 2003\\". 9 January 2004.

Its shores, mostly lined with private homes, also host two small parks, a designated swimming area, a town beach and a bathhouse. The public is not allowed to swim outside of the small swimming area. Description Crystal Lake is situated at above sea level. Its maximum depth is , and its total volume is approximately . It measures about from north to south and from east to west, and has a circumference of about one mile. A spring with subterranean sources, Crystal Lake drains into the South Meadow Brook, which joins the Charles River in Newton Upper Falls, from which it flows into the Atlantic Ocean at Boston Harbor. History Wiswall's Pond can be seen in the center of this map of the city of Newton, drawn in 1700 Thomas Wiswall built a house in 1654 on the southwestern shore of the pond, beside what was then known as the Dedham Trail (now known as Centre Street). From that time until sometime after 1855, the pond became known as \\"Wiswall's Pond\\". Wiswall's great- grandson, Noah Wiswall, dismantled the original house and replaced it with a more modern structure in 1744. In 1780, Noah Wiswall donated a piece of land to a group of people who constructed a Baptist church at the southern shore of the pond, near the modern-day intersection of Old Rogers Street and Centre Street. The pond was often informally called \\"Baptist Pond\\" during the first half of the nineteenth century because it was used for baptisms by the First Baptist Church in Newton. Around 1804, the Wiswall property passed into the possession of the Paul family. The Paul family began to use the lake for commercial ice harvesting, and they built an ice house there in the 1850s. The ice house was situated at the western edge of the lake, near the intersection of present-day Centre Street and Norwood Avenue. Sometime between 1855 and 1875, the name of the pond was changed from \\"Wiswall's Pond\\" to \\"Crystal Lake\\" because this was felt to be a better name from a marketing standpoint. George Henry Ellis (1848-1934) owned the Crystal Lake Ice Company from the late 1800s until at least 1915. The Crystal Lake Ice House was used until it was destroyed in a fire in 1915. A new facility was constructed at a location near the intersection of Walnut and Beacon Street. The company was eventually taken over by Metropolitan Ice Company, and was finally closed and dismantled in 1933.https://archive.org/stream/NewtonGraphicMar_1941/1941-03-Mar_djvu.txthttps://archives.lib.state.ma.us/bitstream/handle/2452/62746/1934acts0187.txt?seq References External links * *Crystal Lake Conservancy Category:Geography of Newton, Massachusetts Category:Lakes of Middlesex County, Massachusetts Category:Lakes of Massachusetts ","title":"Crystal Lake (Newton, Massachusetts)"},{"id":"17743835","text":"More than 1,000 Degar (Montagnard) refugees have entered Ratanakiri and Mondulkiri, Cambodia, since 2001, raising issues of Cambodia's international law obligations toward refugees and its right to control its border.

At the beginning of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1793, the army was a small, awkwardly administered force of barely 40,000 men.Chappell 2004, p. 8. By the end of the period, the numbers had vastly increased. At its peak, in 1813, the regular army contained over 250,000 men.Chandler & Beckett 2003, p. 132. The British infantry was \\"the only military force not to suffer a major reverse at the hands of Napoleonic France.\\" Structure In 1793, shortly before Britain became involved in the French Revolutionary Wars, the army consisted of three regiments of Household Cavalry, 27 line regiments of cavalry, seven battalions in three regiments of Foot Guards and 81 battalions in 77 numbered regiments of line infantry, with two colonial corps (one in New South Wales and one in Canada). There were 36 Independent Companies of Invalids, known by their Captain's name, scattered in garrisons and forts across Great Britain. Administered separately by the Board of Ordnance, the artillery had 40 companies in four battalions of Foot Artillery, 10 companies in the Invalid Battalion, two independent companies in India and a Company of Cadets. Two troops of the Royal Horse Artillery were being organised. The Corps of Royal Engineers and Invalid Corps of Royal Engineers were specialised bodies of officers. The Corps of Royal Military Artificers consisted of six companies. There were also two Independent Companies of Artificers. There was no formal command structure, and a variety of government departments controlled army units depending on where they were stationed; troops in Ireland were controlled by the Irish establishment, rather than the War Office in London, for example. In 1793, the first steps towards formal organisation were taken when fifteen general officers were appointed to command military districts in England and Wales.. Recruitment During the later part of the 18th century Britain was divided into three recruiting areas‚Äîwith England and Wales generally called South Britain‚Äîwhich were further divided into Districts with their own Headquarters. Ireland had separate Districts and organisation, and Scotland, or North Britain, was one administrative area. Home defence, enforcement of law and maintenance of order was primarily the responsibility of the Militia, the Royal Veteran Battalions, the Yeomanry and the Fencibles. Another structure of Recruiting Districts and Sub-Divisions existed alongside this. The British Army drew many of its raw recruits from the lowest classes of Britain. Since army life was known to be harsh, and the remuneration low, it attracted mainly those for whom civilian life was worse. The Duke of Wellington himself said that many of the men \\"enlist from having got bastard children ‚Äì some for minor offences ‚Äì some for drink\\". They were, he once said, \\"the scum of the earth; it is really wonderful that we should have made them to the fine fellows they are.\\"Haythornthwaite 1987, p. 7. In Scotland however, a number of men enlisted due to the collapse of the weaving trade and came from skilled artisan or even middle-class households. Most soldiers at the time signed on for life in exchange for a \\"bounty\\" of ¬£23 17s 6d, a lot of which was absorbed by the cost of outfitting \\"necessities\\", but a system of 'limited service' (seven years for infantry, ten for cavalry and artillery) was introduced in 1806 to attract recruits. Soldiers began, from 1800 onward, to receive a daily Beer money allowance in addition to their regular wages; the practice was started on the orders of the Duke of York.Haythornthwaite 1995, pp. 30‚Äì31. Additionally, corporal punishment was removed for a large number of petty offences (while it was still retained for serious derelictions of duty) and the Shorncliffe System for light infantry was established in 1803, teaching skirmishing, self-reliance and initiative. Unlike other armies of the time, the British did not use conscription to bolster army numbers, with enlistment remaining voluntary. In periods of long service, battalions generally operated under strength; many discharges and deaths were due to wounds and disease. During the Peninsular Campaign, the army lost almost 25,000 men from wounds and disease while fewer than 9,000 were killed directly in action;Glover 1974, p. 37. however more than 30,000 were wounded in action, and many died in the days or weeks to follow. Seriously under-strength battalions might be dissolved, merged with other remnants into \\"Provisional battalions\\" or temporarily drafted into other regiments. Officers ranged in background also. They were expected to be literate, but otherwise came from varied educational and social backgrounds. Although an officer was supposed also to be a \\"gentleman\\", this referred to an officer's character and honourable conduct rather than his social standing. The system of sale of commissions officially governed the selection and promotion of officers, but the system was considerably relaxed during the wars. One in twenty (5%) of the officers from regular battalions had been raised from the ranks, and less than 20% of first commissions were by purchase.Haythornthwaite 1987, p. 8. The Duke of York oversaw a reform of the sale of commissions, making it necessary for officers to serve two full years before either promotion or purchase to captain and six years before becoming a major, improving the quality of the officers through the gained experience. Only a small proportion of officers were from the nobility; in 1809, only 140 officers were peers or peers' sons. A large proportion of officers came from the Militia, and a small number had been gentlemen volunteers, who trained and fought as private soldiers but messed with the officers and remained as such until vacancies (without purchase) for commissions became available.Haythornthwaite 1987, p. 9. Promotion was mainly by seniority; less than 20% of line promotions were by purchase, although this proportion was higher in the Household Division. Promotion by merit alone occurred, but was less common. By 1814 there were over 10,000 officers in the army. Civilian support network Britain mobilized a vast civilian support network to support its 1 million soldiers. Historian Jenny Uglow (2015) explores a multitude of connections between the Army and its support network, as summarized by a review of her book by Christine Haynes: :a whole host of other civilian, actors, including: army contractors, who provided massive quantities of tents, knapsacks, canteens, uniforms, shoes, muskets, gunpowder, ships, maps, fortifications, meat, and biscuit; bankers and speculators, who funded the supplies as well as subsidies to Britain's allies...revenue agents, who collected the wide variety of taxes imposed to finance the wars; farmers, whose fortunes rose and fell not just with the weather but with the war; elites, who amidst war maintained many of the same old routines and amusements; workers, when the context of war found opportunities for new jobs and higher wages but also grievances that led to strikes and riots; and the poor, who suffered immensely through much of this....[And women who] participated in the war not just as relations of combatants but as sutlers, prostitutes, laundresses, spinners, bandage-makers, and drawing-room news-followers.Christine Haynes, Review, ‚Äò‚ÄôJournal of military history April 2016 80#2 p 544Jenny Uglow, In These Times: Living in Britain Through Napoleon's Wars, 1793‚Äì1815 (2015) Infantry Infantry Square at the Battle of Waterloo. The 28th Regiment at Waterloo by Lady Butler There were three regiments of Foot Guards, each of which had 2 or 3 battalions. In background and natural attributes, many recruits to the Foot Guards differed little from those recruited into other regiments, but they received superior training, were better paid, highly motivated and expected to maintain rigorous discipline.Fletcher & Younghusband 1994, p. 13. Soldiers of the 1st Foot Guards There were eventually 104 regiments of the line. They were numbered and, from 1781, were given territorial designations, which roughly represented the area from which troops were drawn. This was not entirely rigid, and most regiments had a significant proportion of English, Irish, Scots and Welsh together, except for certain deliberately exclusive regiments.Haythornthwaite 1987, p. 6. The majority of regiments contained two battalions, while some had only one. One special case, the 60th Foot, ultimately had seven battalions. Battalions were dispersed throughout the army; it was rare for two battalions of any regiment to serve in the same brigade. A line infantry battalion was commanded by its regimental colonel or a lieutenant colonel, and was composed of ten companies, of which eight were \\"centre\\" companies, and two were \\"flank\\" companies: one a grenadier and one a specialist light company. Companies were commanded by captains, with lieutenants and ensigns (or subalterns) beneath him. Ideally, a battalion consisted of 1000 men (excluding NCOs, musicians and officers), but active service depleted the numbers. Generally, the 1st (or senior) battalion of a regiment would draw fit recruits from the 2nd battalion to maintain its strength. If also sent on active service, the 2nd battalion would consequently be weaker. Tactics In the aftermath of the American War of Independence, during which the British infantry had fought in looser formations than previously, rigid close-order linear formations had been advocated by Major General David Dundas. His 1792 Rules and regulations for the formations, field-exercise, and movements, of His Majesty's forcesOnline version of Rules and regulations for the formations, field-exercise, and movements, of His Majesty's forces at the Internet Archive became the standard drill book for the infantry. As the wars progressed line infantry tactics were developed to allow more flexibility for command and control, placing more reliance upon the officers on the spot for quick reactions. British infantry deployed in line prepare to repulse an advancing French column. Disciplined, short-range musket volleys, followed by a bayonet charge, usually drove off an attacker. The line formation was the most favoured, as it offered the maximum firepower, about 1000 to 1500 bullets per minute.Haythornthwaite 1996, p. 26. Though the manual laid down that lines were to be formed in three ranks, the lines were often formed only two ranks deep, especially in the Peninsula. While the French favoured column formation, the line formation enabled all muskets available to fire at the enemy. In contrast, only the few soldiers in the first rows of the column (about 60) were able to fire.Haythornthwaite 1996, p. 5. British infantry were far better trained in musketry than most armies on the continent (30 rounds per man in training for example, compared with only 10 in the Austrian Army) and their volleys were notably steady and effective. The standard weapon of the British infantry was the \\"India Pattern\\" version of the Brown Bess musket. This had an effective range of 100 yards, but fire was often reserved until a charging enemy was within 50 yards. Although the French infantry (and, earlier, the Americans) frequently used buck and ball in their muskets, the British infantry used only standard ball ammunition.Chappell 2004, p. 14. Riflemen and light infantry A number of infantry regiments were newly formed as, or converted into, dedicated regular light infantry regiments. During the early war against the French, the British Army was bolstered by light infantry mercenaries from Germany and the Low Countries, but the British light infantry companies proved inadequate against the experienced and far more numerous French during the Flanders campaign, and in the Netherlands in 1799, and light infantry development became urgent.Chappell 2004, pp. 9‚Äì10. The first rifle-armed unit, the 5th Battalion of the 60th Regiment, was formed mainly from German √©migr√©s before 1795. An Experimental Corps of Riflemen, armed with the Baker rifle, was formed in 1800, and was brought into the line as the 95th Regiment of Foot (Rifles) in 1802. Some of the light units of the King's German Legion were also armed with the same weapon. The rifle-armed units saw extensive service, most prominently in the Peninsular War where the mountainous terrain saw them in their element. In 1803, Sir John Moore converted two regiments (the 43rd Foot and his own regiment, the 52nd Foot), to light infantry at Shorncliffe Camp, the new specialised training camp for light infantry.Chappell 2004, p. 11. Five other regiments (the 51st, 68th, 71st, 85th and 90th) were subsequently converted to light infantry. Under Moore, this change of role was accompanied by a change in the methods of training and discipline, encouraging initiative and replacing punishment for minor infractions with a system of rewards for good conduct. Light infantry and rifle battalions were composed of eight companies. While the rifle-armed units adopted a dark green uniform, the musket-armed light infantry units wore tailless jackets in the traditional red colour. In addition to light infantry duties, they could form up in close order and perform as line infantry if required. They were armed with the \\"New Light Infantry Land Pattern\\" of the standard musket, which had a rudimentary backsight to aid individual accuracy, using the bayonet lug as a foresight. While line regiments fired in volleys, light infantry skirmishers fired at will, taking careful aim at targets.Chappell 2004, pp. 14‚Äì15. Uniform Colonel the Right Hon. Charles Lennox, 2nd Foot Guards in typical undress uniform, 1789 The standard uniform for the majority of regiments throughout the period was the traditional red coat. There was no standardised supply for uniforms, and it was generally left to the regimental colonel to contract for and obtain uniforms for his men, which allowed for some regimental variation.Haythornthwaite 1987, p. 14. Generally, this was in the form of specific regimental badges, or ornamentation for specialised flank companies, but occasionally major differences existed. Highland regiments generally wore kilts and ostrich feather hats, although six of these regiments exchanged the kilt for regulation trousers or tartan trews in 1809. Officers of Highland regiments wore a crimson silk sash worn from the left shoulder to the right hip. Regimental tartans were worn but they were all derived from the Black Watch tartan. White, yellow or red lines were added to distinguish between regiments. Trousers for the rank and file were generally of white cotton duck canvas for summer use, and grey woolen trousers were issued for winter wear, although considerable variation exists in the color of the woolen trousers. Originally, the white trousers were cut as overalls, designed to be worn to protect the expensive breeches and gaiters worn by the rank and file, although on campaign, they were often worn by themselves; a practice which was later permitted except on parade. Soldiers were also issued with grey greatcoats starting in 1803.Haythornthwaite 1987, p. 24. From the last years of the eighteenth century, the bicorne hat was replaced by a cylindrical \\"stovepipe\\" shako. In 1812, this was replaced by the false-fronted \\"Belgic\\" shako, although light infantry continued to wear the stovepipe version. Grenadiers and Foot Guards continued to be issued bearskins, but these were not worn while on campaign. It was in 1802, during this period of uniform transition, that enlisted soldier rank insignia were first designated by chevrons. Their introduction allowed the rapid differentiation of sergeants and corporals from private soldiers. Colour sergeant and Lance corporal ranks soon evolved as well.Ranks Officers were responsible for providing (and paying for) their own uniforms. Consequently, variable styles and decorations were present, according to the officer's private means. Officers in the Infantry wore scarlet coattees with long tails fastened with turnbacks. Close-fitting white pantaloons, tucked into tall Hessian or riding boots were worn, often covered with grey wool and leather overalls on campaign, in addition to a dark blue, later grey, double-breasted greatcoat. After 1811, officers were permitted to wear a short tailed coatee, grey pantaloons or trousers and low field boots on campaign. Officers generally wore silver or gold epaulettes (depending on regimental colours), with regimental badge to designate rank. An 1810 order stipulated that subalterns wore one epaulette, on the right shoulder, while captains wore one of a more ornate pattern on the right shoulder. Field officers wore one on each shoulder, badged with a star (for majors), a crown (lieutenant colonels) or star and crown (colonels).Haythornthwaite 1987, p. 37. Grenadier, fusilier and light infantry officers wore more ornate versions of the shoulder wings their men wore on both shoulders; trimmed with lace, chain or bullion.Fletcher, Younghusband 1994, p. 27. Generals, from 1812, wore an aiguillette over the right shoulder, and rank was denoted by the spacing of buttons on the coatee: Major generals wore their buttons in pairs, lieutenant generals in threes and full generals wore their buttons singly spaced. Until the issue of the Belgic shako in 1812, company officers wore bicorne hats; afterwards, they usually wore the same headgear as their men while on campaign, their status as officers denoted with braided cords. Generals, field officers and staff officers generally wore bicorne hats. Officers were generally armed with the poorly-regarded 1796 Pattern British Infantry Officer's Sword. In light infantry units and the flank companies of line units, they carried the Pattern 1803 sabre instead. In highland regiments, a basket-hilted claymore was generally worn. Colours Buffs defending the Colours at the Battle of Albuera Most British battalions carried flags known as \\"colours\\": the First, or \\"King's Colour\\", and the Second, or \\"Regimental Colour\\". The First had the Union Flag with the Regiment's number in the centre, surrounded by a wreath.Sumner & Hook 2001, p. 3. The Second was in the colour of the regimental facings with a small Union Flag in the corner and the regimental number in centre. (Units whose facing colours were red or white used a St George's Cross design).. The colours were carried into battle for identification, and as a rallying point, in the care of sergeants or ensigns. Attending the colours in battle was dangerous, since they were a target for enemy artillery and assault. Due to the symbolic significance of the colours, their loss was a grave issue, and extreme measures were often taken to prevent such dishonour occurring.Sumner & Hook 2001, pp. 20‚Äì1. The skirmishing and forward positions maintained by light infantry frequently made the bearing of colours inconvenient. For this reason, the newly raised 95th Rifles received no colours, but the converted line regiments retained their existing colours. Some light infantry regiments opted not to carry them in the Peninsula.Sumner & Hook 2001, pp. 22‚Äì23. Medals The widespread use of campaign medals began during the Napoleonic Wars. The Army Gold Medal (\\"Peninsular Medal\\"), in round and cross varieties, was issue to battalion commanders and higher ranks for battle service in the Peninsular War. The cross also saw the first use of Medal bars. Following the battle a Waterloo Medal was issued to all soldiers who participated in that engagement. Decades later the Military General Service Medal was awarded to all ranks for service in campaigns during the 1793‚Äì1814 period. Cavalry British Household Cavalry charging At the start of the French Revolutionary Wars, the \\"heavy\\" cavalry were equivalent to dragoons or \\"medium\\" cavalry in the French and other armies. They consisted of three regiments of Household Cavalry, seven regiments of Dragoon Guards and six regiments of Dragoons. The Dragoon Guards had been regiments of heavy cavalry in the eighteenth century, but had been converted to dragoons to save money. The heavy cavalry wore red uniforms and bicorne hats. From 1796, they were armed with the straight 1796 Heavy Cavalry Sword, a heavy hacking sword which was reckoned to be useless for thrusting, and also carried a long carbine. (The Scots Greys wore a bearskin headdress and had a more curved sword.) The light cavalry units consisted of fourteen regiments of Light Dragoons, which had been formed during the eighteenth century to carry out the roles of scouting and patrolling. In many cases, the regiments were originally troops attached to heavy regiments, before being separated from them and expanded. Some regiments were raised specifically to serve overseas; the 19th and 25th (later the 22nd) Light Dragoons to serve in India, and the 20th to serve in Jamaica. The light dragoons wore short blue braided jackets and the leather Tarleton helmet which had a thick woollen comb. They were armed with the Pattern 1796 light cavalry sabre, which was very sharply curved and generally used for cutting only.. Later in the period, light cavalry carried the short \\"Paget\\" carbine, which had a ramrod attached by a swivel for convenient use. In 1806, four light dragoon regiments (the 7th, 10th, 15th and 18th) were converted into regiments of Hussars, with no change in their role, but a great increase in the expense of their uniforms. From 1812, the uniforms of most of the remaining British cavalry changed, following French styles. The heavy cavalry (excepting the Household Cavalry who adopted a helmet with a prominent woolen comb and the Scots Greys, who retained their bearskins) adopted a helmet with a horsetail crest like those of French dragoons or cuirassiers, while the light dragoons adopted a jacket and shako similar to those of French chasseurs a cheval. The Duke of Wellington objected to these changes, as it became difficult to distinguish French and British cavalry at night or at a distance, but without success. For most of the wars, British cavalry formed a lower proportion of armies in the field than most other European armies, mainly because it was more difficult to transport horses by ship than foot soldiers, and the horses usually required several weeks to recuperate on landing. British cavalry were also more useful within Britain and Ireland for patrolling the country as a deterrent to unrest. Some exceptions were Wellington's Vitoria campaign in 1813, when he required large numbers of cavalry to ensure a decisive result to the campaign, and the Waterloo campaign, where the cavalry needed to be transported only across the English Channel. The British cavalry was usually organised into brigades, but no higher formations. (The cavalry division referred to all cavalry units of an army.) Brigades were attached to infantry divisions or columns, or sometimes acted directly under the command of the cavalry commander of an army. British cavalry were excellently mounted and were reckoned superior to French cavalry if squadrons clashed, but because brigades and even regiments were rarely exercised in battlefield manoeuvres and tactics, they were inferior in larger numbers.. Wellington in particular was highly unimpressed by the quality and intelligence of many of his cavalry officers. He said: Foreign units in British service During the wars, many √©migr√© units were formed from refugees from countries occupied by France, and from among deserters and prisoners of war from the French armies. The oldest of these was the 60th Regiment, which had originally been raised in 1756 for service in America, and which had long been composed primarily of Germans. During the Napoleonic Wars, most of the seven battalions of this regiment served as garrison troops in territories such as the West Indies, but the 5th battalion was raised in 1797 from two other emigre units (Hompesch's Mounted Riflemen and Lowenstein's Chasseurs) as a specialised corps of skirmishers armed with the Baker Rifle, and the 7th battalion was specifically formed to serve in North America during the War of 1812. The largest √©migr√© corps was the King's German Legion, which was formed in 1803 and was composed mainly of German exiles from Hanover and other north German states. In total, it formed two dragoon regiments (which later became light dragoons), three hussar regiments, eight line and two light infantry battalions, and five artillery batteries. Although it never fought as an independent force, its units were often brigaded together. The units of the Legion were regarded as the equal of the best regular British units. The Royal Corsican Rangers were formed in 1798 from among Corsican exiles on Menorca. After being disbanded during the Peace of Amiens, the regiment was reformed in 1803 from Corsicans and Italians (Italian was the main language spoken among Corsicans). It served in the Mediterranean, and was not disbanded until 1817. The King's Dutch Brigade was formed from former personnel of the Dutch States Army (defunct since 1795), who had emigrated to Germany and Britain after the Dutch Republic was overthrown by the Batavian Republic; from deserters from the Batavian army; and mutineers of the Batavian naval squadron that had surrendered to the Royal Navy in the Vlieter Incident, all during the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland in 1799. The brigade was commissioned on 21 October 1799 on the Isle of Wight, after it had been organised by the Hereditary Prince of Orange who had been an allied commander during the Flanders Campaign of 1793‚Äì95. The troops swore allegiance, both to the British Crown, and to the defunct States-General of the Netherlands, the former sovereign power in the Dutch Republic. The troops received both the King's Colours and regimental colours after Dutch model. The brigade counted four regiments of infantry of 18 companies each, 1 regiment of Chasseurs (also of 18 companies), 1 battalion of artillery of 6 companies, and a corps of engineers (96 companies total). The brigade was used in Ireland in 1801, and later on the Channel islands. It was decommissioned on 12 July 1802, after the Peace of Amiens, after which most personnel (but not all) returned to the Batavian Republic, under an amnesty in connection with that treaty. The Dutch Emigrant Artillery was formed in Hanover in 1795 from remnants of Franco-Dutch units. It consisted of three companies and between 1796 and 1803 served in the West Indies to man guns in forts there. In 1803 it was amalgamated into the Royal Foreign Artillery. The Chasseurs Britanniques were originally formed from French Royalist emigres in 1801, and served throughout the wars. The unit served chiefly in the Mediterranean until 1811, when it participated in the later stages of the Peninsular War. It had a good record in battle but later became notorious for desertion, and was not even allowed to perform outpost duty, for fears that the pickets would abscond. In 1812, the Independent Companies of Foreigners were formed from among French prisoners of war for service in North America. The companies became notorious for lack of discipline and atrocities in Chesapeake Bay, and were disbanded. The nominally Swiss Regiment de Meuron was transferred from the Dutch East India Company in Ceylon in 1798. It consisted even when first transferred of soldiers of mixed nationalities, and later recruited from among prisoners of war and deserters from all over Europe. It later served in North America. Two Swiss units in French service were also taken into British service about the same time. The Regiment de Roll was originally created from the disbanded Swiss Guards in the pay of France. Dillon's regiment was also formed from Swiss √©migr√©s from French service. These two regiments were merged into a single provisional battalion, termed the Roll-Dillon battalion, at some stage in the Peninsular War. The Regiment de Watteville was another nominally Swiss unit, which actually consisted of many nationalities. It was formed in 1801 from the debris of four Swiss regiments formed by the British for Austrian service, and served at the Siege of Cadiz and in Canada in 1814. The British Army also raised units in territories that were allied to Britain or that British troops occupied. These included the Royal Sicilian Volunteers and two battalions of Greek Light Infantry. Initially the 1st Greek Light Infantry was formed, then by 1812 The Duke of York's Greek Light Infantry Regiment and in 1813 a second regiment composed of 454 Greeks 2nd Regiment Greek Light Infantry) which occupied Paxoi islands. These regiments included many of the men who were afterwards among the leaders of the Greeks in the War of Independence, such as Theodoros Kolokotronis. During early part of the Peninsular War, some Portuguese soldiers were organised into a Corps known as the Loyal Lusitanian Legion, which eventually was absorbed by the Portuguese Army. Canadian units Four regiments of Fencibles were raised before 1803 in Canada or the Maritime provinces (Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick) as regulars for service in North America. (The New Brunswick Fencibles volunteered for general service and became the 104th Regiment of Foot, but did not serve outside the continent.) A fifth fencible regiment (the Glengarry Light Infantry) was raised as war with the United States of America appeared inevitable. There were also ad-hoc units, such as the Michigan Fencibles and the Mississippi Volunteer Artillery which served in a specific theatre, such as the west around Prairie du Chien and Credit Island. When the War of 1812 broke out, six (later eight) battalions of Select Embodied Militia were formed for full-time service from among the militia or from volunteers. One of these units, the Canadian Voltigeurs, was treated as a regular unit for most purposes. There were also several volunteer company-sized units of dragoons or rangers, and detachments of artillery. A militia company composed entirely of Negroes later became a full-time pioneer unit. After the end of the War in 1815, almost all the fencible and volunteer units were disbanded. Many of the troops and British soldiers discharged in Canada received land grants and became settlers. Daily life While on campaign, it was customary for men to sleep in the open, using their blankets or greatcoats for warmth. Simple blanket tents could be made from two blankets, supported by firelocks, a ramrod, and fixed to the ground with bayonets.Bluth 2001, p. 62. At other times, huts could be made using branches covered with ferns, straw or blankets.Bluth 2001, p. 63. While tents were frequently used by officers, they were not issued to the men until 1813.Bluth 2001, p. 65. Soldiers were allowed to marry, but wives were expected to submit to army rules and discipline, as well contribute to regimental affairs by performing washing, cooking and other duties. Six women per company were officially \\"on the strength\\" and could accompany their husbands on active service, receiving rations and places on troop transports. If there was competition for these places, selections would be made by ballot.Venning 2005, p. 31. Many soldiers also found wives or companions from amongst the local populations, whose presence in the army train was generally tolerated, despite being beyond the quota.Venning 2005, p. 15. However, at the conclusion of the Peninsular War only those wives officially on the strength were allowed to return to Britain with their husbands, resulting in a large number of women and children abandoned in France, with no provisions or means of returning to their homes. Officers also needed permission from their commanding officers to marry, and for their wives to accompany them, but they were not subject to quota, although restrictions might be made due to the officer's age or seniority.Venning 2005, p. 14. Campaigns The British Army fought on a number of fronts during the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic wars, with a brief pause from 1802 to 1803 (and from 1814 to 1815, after Bonaparte abdicated for the first time). French Revolutionary Wars =Mysore, 1789‚Äì1792= Bangalore by Robert Home. The first major engagement involving the British army during the Revolutionary period was the Third Anglo-Mysore War, between Kingdom of Mysore supported by France and led by Tipu Sultan, and the British East India Company supported by its local allies. British regular infantry and artillery regiments formed the core of the East India Company army serving under the command of British general Lord Cornwallis. After some initial setbacks, Cornwallis was ultimately victorious capturing the Mysorean capital city of Seringapatam and compelling Mysore to make peace on terms favourable to Britain. =Toulon= In 1793, French Royalists in Toulon surrendered their port and city to a British fleet under Vice Admiral Samuel Hood. A land force of 18,000 of mixed nationalities, including 2,000 British (mainly Royal Marines), gathered to protect Toulon against a French Republican counter- attack. The commander of the British contingent, Lieutenant General Charles O'Hara, was captured in a minor skirmish, by Captain Napoleon Bonaparte who inspired the besiegers of the port. After the French captured vital forts which commanded the town and harbour, the British and their allies evacuated the port. British troops and ships seized the island of Corsica, turning it temporarily into the Anglo-Corsican Kingdom. Relations between the British and Corsicans soured, and the island was evacuated after Spain declared war on Britain, making it impossible for the Royal Navy to maintain communications with the island. =Flanders, 1793‚Äì1796= In this theatre a British army under the command of the Duke of York formed part of an Allied army with Hanoverian, Dutch, Hessian, Austrian and Prussian contingents, which faced the French Republican Arm√©e du Nord, the Arm√©e des Ardennes and the Arm√©e de la Moselle. The Allies enjoyed several early victories, (including a largely British-fought battle at Lincellesquoted, .), but were unable to advance beyond the French border fortresses and were eventually forced to withdraw by a series of victorious French counter-offensives. The Duke of York led British-allied forces through two ill-fated campaigns in the Netherlands. The Allies then established a new front in southern Holland and Germany, but with poor co-ordination and failing supplies were forced to continue their retreat through the arduous winter of 1794/5. By spring 1795 the British force had left Dutch territory entirely, and reached the port of Bremen where they were evacuated. The campaign exposed many shortcomings in the British army, especially in discipline and logistics, which had developed in the ten years of peacetime neglect since the American Revolution. =West Indies, 1793‚Äì1798= The other major British effort in the early French Revolutionary Wars was mounted against the French possessions in the West Indies. This was mainly for trade considerations; not only were the French islands valuable for their plantations, but they were also used by French privateers preying on British merchant ships. The resulting five-year campaign crippled the whole British Army through disease, especially yellow fever. Out of 89,000 soldiers and NCOs who served in the West Indies, 43,747 died of yellow fever or other tropical diseases. Another 15,503 were discharged, no longer fit for service, or deserted. The islands of Martinique, Guadeloupe and ports in Haiti were captured in 1794 and 1795 by expeditionary forces under General Charles Grey, but the British units were almost exterminated by disease. Negro and mulatto insurgent armies in Haiti which had first welcomed the British as allies turned against them. Guadeloupe was recaptured in 1796 by Victor Hugues, who subsequently executed 865 French Royalists and other prisoners. Eight thousand reinforcements under Lieutenant General Sir Ralph Abercromby arrived in 1796, and secured many French territories, and those of Spain and the Netherlands (which was now titled the Batavian Republic and allied to France). However, the decimated British troops evacuated Haiti, and Guadeloupe was never recaptured, becoming a major privateering base and black market emporium. =Muizenberg and Ceylon 1795= In 1795 a combined British army and Royal Navy force under the command of Major-General James Craig and Admiral Elphinstone captured the Dutch Cape Colony. It remained in British possession for seven years until the Peace of Amiens. At the same time another British force captured the Dutch colony of Trincomalee, Ceylon, which remained in British possession until 1948. =Ireland 1798= A rebellion inspired by a secret society, the Society of United Irishmen, broke out in Ireland. The British Army in Ireland consisted partly of regular troops but mostly of Protestant militia and Irish Yeomanry units. The rebellion was marked by atrocities on both sides. After the rebellion had already failed, a French expedition under General Humbert landed in the west of Ireland. After inflicting an embarrassing defeat on a British militia force at the Battle of Castlebar, Humbert's outnumbered army was surrounded and forced to surrender. =Mysore, 1798‚Äì1799= This was the last war fought between the East India Company and the Kingdom of Mysore. British regular regiments again formed part of the East India Company army, this time under the command of British general George Harris. The British forces defeated Mysore for the final time, capturing Seringapatam and killing Tipu Sultan. =Holland 1799= As part of the War of the Second Coalition, a joint Anglo-Russian force invaded the Netherlands. Although the British troops captured the Dutch fleet, but after the defeat at Castricum, the expedition was a failure and the British commander in chief, the Duke of York negotiated a capitulation which allowed the British to sail away unmolested. =Egypt= In 1798, Napoleon Bonaparte had invaded Egypt, as a stepping stone to India, which was the source of much of Britain's trade and wealth. He was stranded there when Vice Admiral Nelson destroyed the French fleet at the Battle of the Nile. Abercromby's victory over the French at the Battle of Alexandria, resulted in the end of Napoleon's military presence in Egypt. In alliance with the Ottoman Empire, Britain mounted an expedition to expel the French from Egypt. After careful preparations and rehearsals in Turkish anchorages, a British force under Sir Ralph Abercromby made a successful opposed landing at the Battle of Abukir (1801). Abercromby was mortally wounded at the Battle of Alexandria, where the British troops demonstrated the effectiveness of their musketry, improved discipline and growing experience. The French capitulated and were evacuated from Egypt in British ships. Peace of Amiens After Britain's allies all signed treaties with France, Britain also signed the Treaty of Amiens, under which Britain restored many captured territories to France and its allies. The \\"peace\\" proved merely to be an interlude, with plotting and preparations for a renewal of war continuing on both sides. Napoleonic Wars =Maratha, 1803‚Äì1805= Shortly after the resumption of war on the continent, the East India Company once again became involved in war with an Indian power, this time with the Maratha Empire, supported by France. British regiments of infantry, artillery and cavalry once again formed the core of the Company army, this time under the command of British generals Gerrard Lake and Arthur Wellesley. Maratha forces were defeated decisively at Assaye and Delhi and further losses eventually compelled them to make peace. =West Indies, 1804‚Äì1810= When war resumed, Britain once again attacked the French possessions in the West Indies. The French armies which had been sent to recover Haiti in 1803 had, like the British armies earlier, been ravaged by disease, so only isolated garrisons opposed the British forces. In 1805, as part of the manoeuvres which ultimately led to the Battle of Trafalgar, a French fleet carrying 6,500 troops briefly captured Dominica and other islands but subsequently withdrew. In 1808, once the British were allied to Portugal and Spain, they were able to concentrate their forces and capture the French possessions one by one; Cayenne and Martinique in 1809, and Guadeloupe in 1810. Haiti was left to the insurgent armies. =Hanover 1805= In 1805 news arrived in London that Napoleon had broken up his invasion camp at Boulogne, and was marching across Germany. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom William Pitt immediately equipped an army of 15,000 men, and deployed it to Hanover under the command of General William Cathcart, with the intention of linking up with another allied Russian army and creating a diversion in favour of Austria, but Cathcart made no attempt to attack the flank of the far larger French army. Cathcart established his headquarters at Bremen, seized Hanover, fought a small battle at Munkaiser, and then peacefully waited for news. After the death of Pitt and news of the Franco- Prussian agreement handing control of Hanover to Prussia, the ministry recalled Cathcart's army from Germany. =Naples 1805= One of Britain's allies was Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies, whose kingdom was important to British interests in the Mediterranean. In 1805 British forces under the command of General James Craig were part of an Anglo-Russian force intended to secure the Kingdom of Naples. However, after a brief occupation the allied position became untenable with the news of the disastrous Austrian defeat at the Battle of Ulm. =Sicily and the Mediterranean= In 1806, French troops invaded southern Italy, and British troops again went to aid the defenders. A British army under the command of General John Stuart won a lopsided victory at the Battle of Maida. For the rest of the war, British troops defended Sicily, forcing Ferdinand to make liberal reforms. An allied force consisting mainly of Corsicans, Maltese and Sicilians was driven from Capri in 1808. The next year, British troops occupied several Greek and Dalmatian islands, although the French garrison on Corfu was too strong to be attacked. The British retained their Greek islands until the end of the wars. =South Africa and the Plate= British troops storming the Cape of Good Hope. The Dutch colony at the Cape of Good Hope was a vital port of call on the long sea voyage to India. An expedition was sent to capture it in 1805. (It had first been captured in 1796, but was returned under the Treaty of Amiens.) British troops under Lieutenant General Sir David Baird won the Battle of Blaauwberg in January 1806, forcing the surrender of the colony. The naval commander of the expedition, Admiral Home Riggs Popham then conceived the idea of occupying the Spanish Plate River colonies. A detachment under Major General William Carr Beresford occupied Buenos Aires for six weeks, but was expelled by Spanish troops and local militias. General Auchmuty mounted a second invasion of the region in 1807, capturing Montevideo. Lieutenant General Sir John Whitelocke was sent from Britain to take command in the region, arriving at the same time as Major General Robert Craufurd, whose destination had been changed several times by the government, and whose troops had been aboard ship for several months. Whitelock launched a bungled attack on Buenos Aires on 5 July 1807, in which the British troops suffered heavy casualties and were trapped in the city. Finally he capitulated, and the troops returned ignominiously to Britain. Whitelock was court-martialled and cashiered. =Denmark= In August 1807, an expedition was mounted to Copenhagen, to seize the Danish fleet to prevent it falling into French hands. The expedition was led by General Lord Cathcart. A British land force under the command of Arthur Wellesley routed a Danish militia force. After the city was bombarded for several days, the Danes surrendered their fleet. =Alexandria= In 1807 an army and navy expedition under the command of General Alexander Mackenzie Fraser was dispatched with the objective of capturing the Egyptian city of Alexandria to secure a base of operations to disrupt the Ottoman Empire. The people of Alexandria, being disaffected towards Muhammad Ali of Egypt, opened the gates of the city to the British forces, allowing for one of the easiest conquests of a city by the British forces during the Napoleonic Wars. However, due to lack of supplies, and inconclusive operations against the Egyptian forces, the Expedition was forced to re-embark and leave Alexandria. =Walcheren= In 1809, Austria declared war on France. To provide a diversion, a British force consisting mainly of the troops recently evacuated from Corunna was dispatched to capture the Dutch ports of Flushing and Antwerp. There were numerous delays, and the Austrians had already surrendered when the army sailed. The island of Walcheren, where they landed, was pestilential and disease-ridden (mainly with malaria or \\"ague\\"). Although Flushing was captured, more than one third of the soldiers died or were incapacitated before the army was withdrawn. =Indian Ocean and East Indies= To clear nests of French privateers and raiders, the Army captured the French dependencies in the Indian Ocean in the Mauritius campaign of 1809‚Äì1811. With substantial contingents from the East India Company, British troops also captured the Dutch colonies in the Far East in 1810 with the successful Invasion of the Spice Islands and 1811, with the fall of Java. =Peninsular War= Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, who commanded the army in the Peninsula from 1809 to 1814 In 1808, after Bonaparte overthrew the monarchs of Spain and Portugal, an expedition under Sir Arthur Wellesley which was originally intended to attack the Spanish possessions in Central America was diverted to Portugal. Wellesley won the Battle of Vimeiro while reinforcements landed at nearby Maceira Bay.Chappell 2004, p. 17. Wellesley was superseded in turn by two superiors, Sir Harry Burrard and Sir Hew Dalrymple, who delayed further attacks. Instead, they signed the Convention of Sintra, by which the French evacuated Portugal (with all their loot) in British ships. Although this secured the British hold on Lisbon, it resulted in the three generals' recall to England, and command of the British troops devolved on Sir John Moore.Chappell 2004, p. 18. In October, Moore led the army into Spain, reaching as far as Salamanca. In December, they were reinforced by 10,000 troops from England under Sir David Baird. Moore's army now totalled 36,000, but his advance was cut short by the news that Napoleon had defeated the Spanish and captured Madrid, and was approaching with an army of 200,000. Moore retreated to Corunna over mountain roads and through bitter winter weather. French cavalry pursued the British Army the length of the journey, and a Reserve Division was set to provide rearguard protection for the British troops, which were engaged in much fighting. About 4,000 troops separated from the main force and marched to Vigo.Glover 1974, p. 82. The French caught up with the main army at Corunna, and in the ensuing Battle of Corunna in January 1809, Moore was killed; the remnant of the army was evacuated to England. In 1809, Wellesley returned to Portugal with fresh forces, and defeated the French at the Second Battle of Porto, driving them from the country. He again advanced into Spain and fought the Battle of Talavera and the Battle of the C√¥a. He and the Spanish commanders were unable to cooperate, and he retreated into Portugal, where he constructed the defensive Lines of Torres Vedras which protected Lisbon, while he reorganised his Anglo-Portuguese Army into divisions, most of which had two British brigades and one Portuguese brigade. The next year, when a large French army under Marshal Andr√© Mass√©na invaded Portugal, Wellesley fought a delaying action at the Battle of Bussaco, before withdrawing behind the impregnable Lines, leaving Massena's army to starve in front of them. After Massena withdrew, there was fighting for most of 1811 on the frontiers of Portugal, as Wellesley attempted to recover vital fortified towns. A British and Spanish force under Beresford fought the very bloody Battle of Albuera, while Wellesley himself won the Battle of Sabugal in April, and the Battle of Fuentes de Onoro in May. Major British battles of the Peninsular War In January 1812, Wellesley captured Ciudad Rodrigo after a surprise move. On 6 April, he then stormed Badajoz, another strong fortress, which the British had failed to carry on an earlier occasion. There was heavy fighting with very high casualties and Wellesley ordered a withdrawal, but a diversionary attack had gained a foothold by escalade and the main attack through the breaches was renewed. The fortress was taken, at great cost (over 5000 British casualties), and for three days the army sacked and pillaged the town in undisciplined revenge.Chappell 2004, p. 24. Soon after the assault on Badajoz, Wellesley (now raised to the peerage as Marquess Wellington) marched into northern Spain. For a month the British and French armies marched and counter-marched against each other around Salamanca. On 22 July, Wellington took advantage of a momentary French dispersion and gained a complete victory at the Battle of Salamanca. After occupying Madrid, Wellington unsuccessfully besieged Burgos. In October, the army retreated to Portugal. This \\"Winter Retreat\\" bore similarities to the earlier retreat to Corunna, as it suffered from poor supplies, bitter weather and rearguard action.Chappell 2004, p. 33. In spring 1813, Wellington resumed the offensive, leaving Portugal and marching northwards through Spain, dropping the lines of communication to Lisbon and establishing new ones to the Spanish ports on the Bay of Biscay. At the Battle of Vitoria the French armies were routed,Chappell 2004, p. 34. disgorging an enormous quantity of loot, which caused the British troops to abandon the pursuit and break ranks to plunder. Wellington's troops subsequently defeated French attempts to relieve their remaining fortresses in Spain. During the autumn and winter, they forced the French defensive lines in the Pyrenees and crossed into France, winning the Battle of Nivelle, the Battle of Nive and the Battle of Orthez in February 1814. In France, the discipline of Wellington's British and Portuguese troops was far superior to that of the Spanish, and even that of the French, thanks to plentiful supplies delivered by sea. Battle of Nivelle, 1813 On 31 March 1814, allied armies entered Paris, and Napoleon abdicated on 6 April.Glover 1974, p. 326. The news was slow to reach Wellington, who fought the indecisive Battle of Toulouse on 10 April.Glover 1974, p. 329. Once peace agreements had finally been settled, the army left the Peninsula. The infantry marched to Bordeaux for transportation to their new postings (several to North America). Many Spanish wives and girlfriends were left behind, to general distress. The cavalry rode through France to Boulogne and Calais.Bryant 1950, p. 98. =Holland 1814= In 1814, the British government had sent a small force to Holland under Sir Thomas Graham to capture the fortress of Bergen op Zoom. The attack, on 8 March 1814, failed and the British were repelled, with heavy losses.Bryant 1950, p. 86. =War in North America= Although the United States of America was not allied to France, war broke out between America and Britain ostensibly over issues of trade embargoes and impressment of American sailors into the Royal Navy, both of which were directly or indirectly linked to the Napoleonic wars (the latter of which was not even brought up during the Treaty of Ghent). For the first two years of the war, a small number of British regular units formed the hard core around which the Canadian militia rallied. Multiple US invasions north of the border were repulsed; such an example can be seen at the Battle of Crysler's Farm in which battalions of 89th and 49th Regiments attacked and routed a significantly larger American force making its way toward Montreal. In 1814, larger numbers of British regulars became available after the abdication of Napoleon. However, long and inadequate supply lines constrained the British war effort. In Chesapeake Bay, a British force captured and burned Washington, but was repulsed at Baltimore. Neither side could strike a decisive blow which would compel the other to cede favourable terms, and the Treaty of Ghent was signed. Before news of it could reach the armies on the other side of the Atlantic, a British force under Wellington's brother-in-law Sir Edward Pakenham was defeated foolhardily attacking heavily fortified positions at the Battle of New Orleans. =Waterloo Campaign 1815= It appeared that war was finally over, and arrangements for the peace were discussed at the Congress of Vienna. But on 26 February 1815, Napoleon escaped from Elba and returned to France, where he raised an army. By 20 March he had reached Paris.Nofi 1998, pp. 19, 28. The Allies assembled another army and planned for a summer offensive.Nofi 1998, p. 31. The Waterloo Campaign Basing themselves in Belgium, the Allies formed two armies, with the Duke of Wellington commanding the Anglo-Allies, and Gebhard Leberecht von Bl√ºcher commanding the Prussians. Napoleon marched swiftly through France to meet them, and split his army to launch a two-pronged attack. On 16 June 1815, Napoleon himself led men against Bl√ºcher at Ligny, while Marshall Ney commanded an attack against Wellington's forward army at the Battle of Quatre Bras. Wellington successfully held Quatre Bras, but the Prussians were not so successful at Ligny, and were forced to retreat to Wavre. Hearing of Bl√ºcher's defeat on the morning of 17 June, Wellington ordered his army to withdraw on a parallel course to his ally; the British and Belgians took position near the Belgian village of Waterloo. On the morning of 18 June, one of the greatest ever feats of British arms began: The Battle of Waterloo. The British, Dutch, Belgian, Nassau and German troops were posted on higher ground south of Waterloo. There had been heavy rain overnight and Napoleon chose not to attack until almost midday. The delay meant that the Prussians had a chance to march towards the battle, but in the meantime, Wellington had to hold on. The French started their attack with an artillery bombardment. The first French attacks were then directed against the Chateau of Hougemont down from the main ridge. Here British and Nassau troops stubbornly defended the Hougomont buildings all day; the action eventually engaging a whole French Corps which failed to capture the Chateau. At half past one, the Anglo-Allied Army was assaulted by d'Erlon's infantry attack on the British left wing but the French were forced back with heavy losses. Later in the afternoon, British troops were amazed to see waves of cavalrymen heading towards them. The British troops, as per standard drill, formed infantry squares (hollow box-formations four ranks deep) after which the French cavalry was driven off. The British position was critical after the fall of La Haye Sainte, but fortunately, the Prussians started entering the battlefield. As the Prussian advance guard began to arrive from the east, Napoleon sent French units to stabilise his right wing. At around seven o'clock, Napoleon ordered his Old and Middle Guard to make a final desperate assault on the by now fragile Allied line. The attack was repulsed. At that point Wellington stood up and waved his hat in the air to signal a general advance. His army rushed forward from the lines in a full assault on the retreating French. Napoleon lost the battle. Later history Following the conclusion of the wars, the army was reduced. At this time, infantry regiments existed up to 104th Foot, but between 1817 and 1819, the regiments numbered 95th Foot up were disbanded,Haythornthwaite 1995, p. 19. and by 1821 the army numbered only 101,000 combatants, 30% of which were stationed in the colonies, especially India.Haythornthwaite 1995, p. 18. Over the following decades, various regiments were added, removed or reformed to respond to military or colonial needs, but it never grew particularly large again until the First World War, and the Empire became more reliant on local forces to maintain defence and order.

It has come to be the standard English form of Latin Guendoloena, which was first used by Geoffrey of Monmouth as the name of a legendary British queen in his History of the Kings of Britain (). He reused the name in his Life of Merlin (c. 1150) for a different character, the wife of the titular magician \\"Merlinus\\", a counsellor to King Arthur; the metre shows that Geoffrey pronounced it as a pentasyllable, Guƒïnd≈èl≈èƒìnƒÉ, with the \\"gu\\" pronounced . Dr. Arthur Hutson suggests that \\"Guendoloena\\" arose from a misreading of the old Welsh masculine name Guendoleu; Geoffrey may have mistaken the final U for an N, then Latinized *Guendolen as a feminine name to arrive at Guendoloena. In the Vita Merlini, however, Geoffrey Latinizes the masculine name of Gwenddoleu ap Ceidio as Guennolous. Spelled Gwendoloena, the name reoccurs in the anonymous Latin romance De Ortu Waluuanii belonging to Arthur's queen Guinevere. It did not become a common English given name until the 19th century. Gwendoline was in use in England by the 1860s (an early example being Lady Gwendoline Anson, born c. 1837, a daughter of the 1st Earl of Lichfield),Sheard, K. M.

The Besicovitch covering theorem asserts that there exists a constant cN depending only on the dimension N with the following property: * Given any Besicovitch cover F of a bounded set E, there are cN subcollections of balls A1 = {Bn1}, ‚Ä¶, AcN = {BncN} contained in F such that each collection Ai consists of disjoint balls, and : E \\\\subseteq \\\\bigcup_{i=1}^{c_N} \\\\bigcup_{B\\\\in A_i} B. Let G denote the subcollection of F consisting of all balls from the cN disjoint families A1,...,AcN. The less precise following statement is clearly true: every point x ‚àà RN belongs to at most cN different balls from the subcollection G, and G remains a cover for E (every point y ‚àà E belongs to at least one ball from the subcollection G). This property gives actually an equivalent form for the theorem (except for the value of the constant). * There exists a constant bN depending only on the dimension N with the following property: Given any Besicovitch cover F of a bounded set E, there is a subcollection G of F such that G is a cover of the set E and every point x ‚àà E belongs to at most bN different balls from the subcover G. In other words, the function SG equal to the sum of the indicator functions of the balls in G is larger than 1E and bounded on RN by the constant bN, : \\\\mathbf{1}_E \\\\le S_{\\\\mathbf {G}} := \\\\sum_{B \\\\in \\\\mathbf{G}} \\\\mathbf{1}_B \\\\le b_N. Application to maximal functions and maximal inequalities Let Œº be a Borel non-negative measure on RN, finite on compact subsets and let f be a Œº-integrable function. Define the maximal function f^* by setting for every x (using the convention \\\\infty \\\\times 0 = 0) :f^*(x) = \\\\sup_{r > 0} \\\\Bigl( \\\\mu(B(x, r))^{-1} \\\\int_{B(x, r)} f(y) \\\\, d\\\\mu(y) \\\\Bigr). This maximal function is lower semicontinuous, hence measurable. The following maximal inequality is satisfied for every Œª > 0 : :\\\\lambda \\\\, \\\\mu \\\\bigl( \\\\\\\\{ x : f^*(x) > \\\\lambda \\\\\\\\} \\\\bigr) \\\\le b_N \\\\, \\\\int f \\\\, d\\\\mu. ;Proof. The set EŒª of the points x such that f^*(x) > \\\\lambda clearly admits a Besicovitch cover FŒª by balls B such that :\\\\int \\\\mathbf{1}_B \\\\, f \\\\ d\\\\mu = \\\\int_{B} f(y) \\\\, d\\\\mu(y) > \\\\lambda \\\\, \\\\mu(B). For every bounded Borel subset E¬¥ of EŒª, one can find a subcollection G extracted from FŒª that covers E¬¥ and such that SG ‚â§ bN, hence :\\\\begin{align} \\\\lambda \\\\, \\\\mu(E') &\\\\le \\\\lambda \\\\, \\\\sum_{B \\\\in \\\\mathbf{G}} \\\\mu(B)\\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\le \\\\sum_{B \\\\in \\\\mathbf{G}} \\\\int \\\\mathbf{1}_B \\\\, f \\\\, d\\\\mu = \\\\int S_{\\\\mathbf {G}} \\\\, f \\\\, d\\\\mu \\\\le b_N \\\\, \\\\int f \\\\, d\\\\mu, \\\\end{align} which implies the inequality above. When dealing with the Lebesgue measure on RN, it is more customary to use the easier (and older) Vitali covering lemma in order to derive the previous maximal inequality (with a different constant).

Descended from Robert Forrester, a First Fleet convict, Forrester was known as Black Bill to distinguished him from a cousin also of the name William Forrester. He was a racehorse owner and trainer who owned Warwick Farm. Forrester achieved a quinella in the 1897 Melbourne Cup with the brother horses, Gaulus and The Grafter. The Grafter also won the Cup in 1898, surviving a protest. In 1881, Forrester purchased land at what was originally called Warwick Park. He renamed it Warwick Farm to correspond with his own initials, and built a family homestead along with racing stables and a thoroughbred stud. Forrester held the inaugural race meeting at Warwick Farm on 16 March 1889, after forming a syndicate called The Warwick Farm Racing Club. Forrester contested the Melbourne Cup 5 times with 2 wins. His winnings would have been worth more than A$4 million, with trophies valued at A$70,000. Because of his gambling debts, Bill was almost destitute at the time of his death at age 57 on 23 August 1901. At one time, he allegedly wagered the deeds of his Warwick Farm house on a card game; he won. Forrester owned a large part of Warwick Farm Racecourse. It was later revealed he had sold much of his property to discharge his gambling debts. After his death, Sydney Tattersalls Club opened a subscription to assist his widow, Emily, their 3 daughters and their son. The Australian Jockey Club bought the Warwick Farm course in 1922, with the first meeting held in the refurbished surrounds in 1925. Many years after Forrester and his wife's death, and with the redevelopment of Liverpool cemetery, one of their daughters, Ellie May, had her parents remains exhumed and cremated at Northern Suburbs.

It ruptured along the Queen Charlotte Fault both northward and southward more than . Shaking was felt throughout British Columbia, parts of Washington, Oregon, Alberta, the Yukon, and Alaska. No deaths were reported in this earthquake. Earthquake The 1949 Queen Charlotte Islands earthquake was caused by a rupture on the Queen Charlotte Fault, which forms part of the boundary between the Pacific and North American plates. This fault runs from northern Vancouver Island, west of the Queen Charlotte Islands, up to the Gulf of Alaska. The earthquake ruptured the fault for a distance more than . Because this quake occurred before the modern surface wave magnitude scale was developed and widely implemented, this earthquake may have only had the same overall intensity as the 2012 Haida Gwaii earthquake. In future there may be some research done to compare the two earthquake events. This earthquake, larger than the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, is Canada's largest earthquake recorded by seismometers. However, the greatest earthquake in Canadian history was the 1700 Cascadia earthquake, a megathrust earthquake that occurred along the Pacific Northwest coast from Northern California to southwestern British Columbia which reached magnitude 9 on the Richter magnitude scale.EnviroZine: Environment Canada's Online Newsmagazine Retrieved on 2008-06-03 Damage Although nobody was killed in this earthquake, people and animals were knocked off their feet and there were landslides and other damage.

The east‚Äìwest part is normally passable in late summer, but the west end which turns northwest (McClure Strait) is normally filled with ice. The Parry Channel is a natural waterway through the central Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Its eastern two-thirds lies in the territory of Nunavut, while its western third (west of 110¬∞ West) lies in the Northwest Territories. It runs east to west, connecting Baffin Bay in the east with the Beaufort Sea in the west. Its eastern end is the only practical entrance to the Northwest Passage. Its western end would be a natural exit from the archipelago were it not filled with ice. The channel separates the Queen Elizabeth Islands to the north from the rest of Nunavut. Named parts of the Channel are, from east to west, Lancaster Sound, Barrow Strait, Viscount Melville Sound and McClure Strait. On the south are Baffin Island, Admiralty Inlet (Nunavut) and the Brodeur Peninsula of Baffin Island, Prince Regent Inlet which leads to the large Gulf of Boothia, Somerset Island (Nunavut), Peel Sound which is the main route south, Prince of Wales Island (Nunavut), the ice-choked M'Clintock Channel, Victoria Island (Canada), the narrow Prince of Wales Strait and Banks Island. On the north are Devon Island, Wellington Channel, Cornwallis Island (Nunavut), McDougall Sound, Bathurst Island (Nunavut), Melville Island (Arctic) and Prince Patrick Island. Parry Channel is named after Arctic explorer William Edward Parry who in 1819 got as far as Melville Island before being blocked by ice at McClure Strait. The next ship to get this far west was part of the Edward Belcher expedition in 1850.

The Scottish Rite is one of the appendant bodies of Freemasonry that a Master Mason may join for further exposure to the principles of Freemasonry. To join the Supreme Council, one must attain the 32¬∞ of the Scottish Rite, and then be conferred the honorary 33¬∞. In the Southern Jurisdiction of the United States, the Supreme Council consists of no more than 33 members, and is presided over by a Grand Commander.

In 1911 the Mother Supreme Council began construction of a national headquarters of the Supreme Council in the District of Columbia, called the House of the Temple. Finished in 1915, the House of the Temple remains their headquarters to this day. It is located at 1733 Sixteenth Street, NW. The House of the Temple also contains the remains of Albert Pike, the author of Morals and Dogma. In 1813, a member of the Supreme Council established in New York a Supreme Council for the Northern Jurisdiction of the United States of America. In 1823, the Supreme Council granted jurisdiction of the fifteen states east of the Mississippi River and north of the Ohio River to the Supreme Council for the Northern Jurisdiction.

Investigation From 1993 through 2006, Albaugh was employed by U.S. Representative Ernest Istook, eventually becoming Chief of Staff for Istook in 1998. In the plea agreement, Albaugh admitted that from approximately March 2002 until approximately May 2004 he accepted campaign contributions, tickets to sporting events and meals from Kevin A. Ring, Greenberg Traurig and their clients, in exchange for agreeing to take and taking official action on their behalf. The documents also document that Istook called Abramoff in 2003, to thank him in advance for use of one of Abramoff's suites at FedEx Field in Landover, Md., for a fundraising event. During the call, Istook asked Abramoff which projects his clients wanted in the upcoming transportation bill. The documents refer to an e-mail Abramoff sent to his lobby colleagues saying Istook \\"had basically asked what we want in the transportation bill\\" and instructing the lobbyists to \\"make sure we load up our entire Christmas list.\\" Plea agreement In June 2008 Albaugh pleaded guilty to conspiracy with Kevin Ring. As part of his plea agreement Albaugh wore a wire during a conversation with former Congressman Istook, testified for three days during trial, and provided other assistance to the government. However, Albaugh's plea agreement fell apart when he informed the government that his actions were motivated by campaign contributions provided by Kevin Ring to Congressman Istook, and not by tickets to sporting events or meals provided by Ring to Albaugh. As a result of breaking his plea agreement the government requested Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle to sentence Albaugh to 27 months in prison. Judge Huvelle, however, rejected that request and instead sentenced Albaugh to four months in a half-way house citing his cooperation with the government investigation and saying \\"There are three or four Congressman out there that will never see the light of day for their actions, and we're blaming the staffers,\\". Huvelle declined to fine Albaugh or require him to perform community service because of his work with a non-profit organization which operates schools and medical clinics in Afghanistan saying that it was unnecessary. Retirement Albaugh currently resides in Colorado where he works for a non-profit organization which operates schools and medical clinics in Afghanistan.

McVey studied at the Cleveland Institute of Art (1927‚Äì1932) and at the Colorado Springs Fine Art Center (1943‚Äì1944). In 1932, she married the sculptor William Mozart McVey, and from 1935 to 1947, she worked as a ceramist in Houston, Austin, and San Antonio. William accepted a teaching position at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan in 1947, and there she met the Finnish artist Maija Grotell and became friends with the Japanese-American artist Toshiko Takaezu who studied at the Cranbrook Academy from 1951 to 1954. In 1953, McVey returned to her native city of Cleveland and established her studio in the suburb of Pepper Pike, Ohio. McVey's large-scaled, biomorphic, asymmetrical work is said to reflect her dissatisfaction with wheel-thrown pieces and to have led the way for modern ceramic art in the United States. Influenced by surrealism, her sculptural stoneware and porcelain works embody the natural, organic form. In 1965, the Cleveland Institute of Art presented a major retrospective of her work that included seventy-five large scale sculptures or what she called \\"ceramic forms.\\" By 1979 McVey's production slowed due to her failing eyesight.

Early life Alfredo Silipigni was born in Atlantic City on April 9, 1931, a son of Italian immigrants. He attended the Westminster Choir College in Princeton, New Jersey and the Juilliard School. He made his Carnegie Hall debut at 25 with the NBC Symphony Orchestra, and went on to conduct at the Vienna State Opera and the English National Opera. Life He was principal conductor and artistic director of the New Jersey State Opera since its founding, guiding the company from an amateur venture to a respected professional company. Silipigni was known for his talent conducting verismo opera. Death Silipigni died on March 25 at the age of 74 in Livingston, New Jersey. His death was caused by complications of pneumonia.https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/29/arts/music/29silipigni.html?_r=1&oref;=slogin Silipigni is survived by his wife of 45 years, Gloria; daughters Marisa and Elizabeth Silipigni; son Alfred Silipigni; and two grandchildren, Carolyn and Rob. Silipigni was born in Atlantic City and educated at the Juilliard School and Westminster Choir College of Rider University. He made his Carnegie Hall debut with the NBC Symphony Orchestra at 25; his international career included appearances with the Vienna State Opera, English National Opera, Teatrale L'Opera de Montreal, and Opera de Bellas Artes in Mexico City. Silipigni conducted Puccini's Turandot for the NJSOpera's house debut at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center (Newark) in February and March 1998. Pl√°cido Domingo often requested Silipigni when singing verismo; one such occasion was the 1999 production of Giordano's Fedora in Mexico City, with Domingo as Ipanov. Other stars were also Silipigni fans, including Metropolitan Opera singers Licia Albanese and Jerome Hines, who often sang in his productions. Silipigni also worked with Birgit Nilsson (singing her last American Turandot), Franco Corelli, Carlo Bergonzi, Roberta Peters, Beverly Sills, Richard Tucker, and the verismo specialists Giuseppe Taddei and Magda Olivero. In October 2002, Silipigni conducted two performances of Verdi's Aida in Shanghai with a cast of 1,500 and audiences of more than 50,000, according to the NJSOpera web site. According to the Star Ledger, Silipigni's greatest legacy was convincing funders that New Jersey deserved an opera company of its own. Researcher Silipigni, a dapper figure of old-world elegance with a pencil-thin mustache, manicured nails and ascot, was as meticulous with his productions as he was with his own appearance. Before conducting works like Leoncavallo's Zaza, Cilea's Adriana Lecouvreur and Verdi's Attila, he did painstaking research. For a production of Tosca six years ago, he matched the color of choir robes used in Rome in 1800. Often, the works had not been heard in the United States for decades before Silipigni presented them, turning Newark, NJ where the company was based, into a destination for lovers of verismo and operatic obscurities. In 1973 he took the New Jersey State Opera to New York's Carnegie Hall where he conducted the United States' premiere of a long forgotten Donizetti opera, Catarina Cornaro. Shanghai He also did things on a grand scale. In 2000, he conducted two performances of Aida before tens of thousands of people at a stadium in Shanghai, with a cast put at 3,000. New Jersey In 1965, an amateur troupe, the Opera Theater of Westfield, NJ, asked him to take charge, and he set about turning it into a professional operation. Many singers with big reputations chose to sing with Silipigni and his modest company. Beverly Sills, Birgit Nilsson, Anna Moffo and Pl√°cido Domingo were a few. He also brought in exciting singers based in other parts of the world for rare American appearances, Turkish soprano Leyla Gencer, the renowned verismo specialist Magda Olivero, and dramatic tenor Nicola Martinucci among others. Silipigni died on March 3, 2006 in Livingston, NJ. He was 74 and lived in West Orange, NJ. The cause of death was complications of pneumonia, said Astera Argyris, a spokeswoman for the opera company. Silipigni is survived by his wife, Gloria; three children, Marisa, Elisabetta and Alfred; a brother, Richard; and two grandchildren, Carolyn and Robert. In an interview with The New York Times in 2000, Silipigni said his goal at the start of his career was to make great music. \\"Now, that just seems grand and pompous,\\" he said. \\"I conduct for myself. If it is not what consumes me, then it doesn't work for me.\\"Wakin, Daniel J. \\"Alfredo Silipigni, 74, Who Founded an Opera Company, Dies\\", The New York Times, March 29, 2006.

Built in 1928, it was known for its first year as the Hotel Somerville. Upon its opening, it hosted the first national convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) to be held in the western United States. In 1930, the hotel was renamed the Dunbar, and it became the most prestigious hotel in LA's African- American community. In the early 1930s, a nightclub opened at the Dunbar, and it became the center of the Central Avenue jazz scene in the 1930s and 1940s. The Dunbar hosted Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway, Billie Holiday, Louis Armstrong, Lionel Hampton, Count Basie, Lena Horne, and many other jazz legends. Other noteworthy people who stayed at the Dunbar include W. E. B. Du Bois, Joe Louis, Ray Charles, and Thurgood Marshall. Former heavyweight champion Jack Johnson also ran a nightclub at the Dunbar in the 1930s. No longer a hotel, the building was renovated in the 2010s and is now part of a larger residential community named Dunbar Village. Hotel Somerville opens in 1928 Originally known as Hotel Somerville, the Central Avenue landmark was a source of pride in the African American community when it opened in 1928. The hotel was built in 1928 by John and Vada Somerville, socially and politically prominent black Angelenos. Vada Somerville was the first African-American woman in California to received a Doctor of Dental Surgery degree at University of Southern California. John Somerville was the first black to graduate from the University of Southern California. The hotel was built entirely by black contractors, laborers, and craftsmen and financed by black community members. For many years, the Somerville was the only major hotel in Los Angeles that welcomed blacks, and it quickly became the place to stay for visiting black dignitaries. In 1928, the Somerville housed delegates to the first NAACP convention held in the western United States. In 1929, when Oscar De Priest (the first African American to serve in Congress in the 20th century) visited Los Angeles, he was met at the station \\"by a large delegation of colored people, who formed a parade and escorted him to the Dunbar Hotel.\\" The hotel was known for its physical amenities. Its Art Deco lobby had a spectacular chandelier (also in the Art Deco style), Spanish arcade-like windows, tiled walls and a flagstone floor. The lobby was said to look like \\"a regal Spanish arcade, with open balconies and steel grillwork, as opulent as the Granada Building at Lafayette Park.\\" One person who was present at the hotel's groundbreaking ceremony recalled it was \\"a palace compared to what we had been used to.\\" The hotel came to represent a level of achievement among the black community. Historian Lonnie G. Bunch III said, \\"On the one hand, blacks were not allowed to stay at major hotels. But with enough financial wherewithal and a strong sense of community a black man could build a large hotel.\\" Unlike earlier segregated hotels and boarding houses, the Somerville (and later the Dunbar) offered luxury amenities ‚Äì a restaurant, cocktail lounge and barbershop. One person noted, \\"The Dunbar symbolizes luxury and respect even in the worst of times.\\" Roy Wilkins wrote in the New York Amsterdam News of the hotel's luxury and service: \\"Everything was just the opposite of what we had come to expect in 'Negro' hotels.\\" The Somerville/Dunbar also played an important role in anchoring the new Central Avenue community. Prior to 1928, the black community in Los Angeles had been centered around 12th Street and Central Avenue, near Downtown Los Angeles. Somerville was the first to build a major structure so far south in the 42nd Street neighborhood, and soon other businesses followed. After the stock market crash in 1929, Somerville was forced to sell the hotel to a syndicate of white investors. The passing of the hotel from its original black ownership was a disappointment for a community that viewed the hotel as a symbol of black achievement. The hotel was renamed the Dunbar in 1929, in honor of poet Paul Lawrence Dunbar. In 1930, the hotel was purchased for $100,000 by Lucius W. Lomax, Sr. (1879-1961). With ownership being restored to an African- American, the \\"debilitating impact of John Somerville's loss was reversed, and the hotel once again became the gem of black Los Angeles.\\" During Somerville's ownership, there was no nightclub or live music at the hotel. It was not until February 1931 that the Dunbar was issued a permit \\"to conduct a cabaret in the dining room.\\" Though he had sold the hotel, Somerville and others in the neighborhood opposed the establishment of a cabaret in his hotel, stating that such a use \\"would cast a lasting stigma on it.\\" Hub of the Central Avenue scene Billie Holiday and other African American performers stayed at the Dunbar when working in LA. The Dunbar became known in the 1930s and 1940s as \\"the hub of Los Angeles black culture,\\" and \\"the heart of Saturday night Los Angeles.\\" In its heyday, it was known as \\"a West Coast mixture of the Waldorf- Astoria and the Cotton Club.\\" The Los Angeles Herald-Examiner described the Dunbar this way: > It was once the most glorious place on 'the Avenue.' At the Dunbar Hotel ... > you could dance to the sounds of Cab Calloway, laugh till your stomach hurt > with Redd Foxx and maybe, just maybe, get a room near Billie Holiday or Duke > Ellington. The Dunbar hosted prominent African Americans traveling to Los Angeles, including Duke Ellington, Joe Louis, Louis Armstrong, Lena Horne, Paul Robeson, Marian Anderson, and Josephine Baker. The Dunbar was \\"the gathering spot for the cr√®me de la cr√®me of black society, the hotel for performers who could entertain in white hotels but not sleep in them.\\" In 1940, radio comedian Eddie \\"Rochester\\" Anderson used the Dunbar as his headquarters while \\"campaigning\\" for the honorary seat of \\"Mayor of Central Avenue.\\" The Dunbar also became the place where African American political and intellectual leaders and writers, including Langston Hughes, W. E. B. Du Bois, Ralph Bunche, Thurgood Marshall and James Weldon Johnson, gathered. It has been described as \\"a place where the future of black America was discussed every night of the week in the lobby.\\" Celes King, whose family owned the Dunbar in its heyday, said, \\"They were very serious discussions between people like W. E. B. Du Bois (founder of the NAACP), doctors, lawyers, educators and other professionals. This was the place where many of them put together the plans to improve the life style of their people.\\" One of the regulars at the Dunbar in its heyday was future mayor Tom Bradley, then a young police officer. Bradley would stop in for coffee and conversation. Bradley later recalled, \\"I remember, from the days of my childhood, walking down the avenue, just to get a look at some of those famous superstars.\\" More than anything, the Dunbar is remembered for its role in the Central Avenue jazz scene. The nightclub at the Dunbar was the home-away-from-home for, and the stage for performances by, artists including Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Louis Jordan, Count Basie, Lionel Hampton, Lena Horne, Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Cab Calloway, and Nat King Cole. Even Ray Charles stayed at the Dunbar when he first moved to Los Angeles. In addition to the main nightclub, former heavyweight champion Jack Johnson opened his Showboat nightclub at the Dunbar in the 1930s. \\"Jack Johnson ... ran his Showboat nightclub in one corner, and black bands practiced on the mezzanine for acts across town later that night.\\" The hotel was also popular with the white community, and many from Hollywood spent their Saturday nights at the Dunbar and surrounding clubs. Celes King recalled once when Bing Crosby bounced a check at the hotel, and her father (the hotel's owner) kept Crosby's check. \\"It was a big joke between them.\\" The neighborhood was also the home of other famous jazz clubs, including Club Alabam (next door), the Last Word (across the street), and the Downbeat (nearby). Even local musicians who were playing at other Central Avenue clubs would gather at the Dunbar. Lee Young, the drummer who led a band at the Club Alabam, recalled: \\"The fellows in the band ‚Äì Charles Mingus, Art Pepper, all of us ‚Äì would hang out between sets next door at the Dunbar ... Between the club and the hotel you'd see movie stars and all the big show business names of the day.\\" Buck Clayton wrote that Duke Ellington threw parties at the Dunbar with \\"chicks and champagne everywhere.\\" Musician Jack Kelson recalled the sidewalk in front of the Dunbar as the most desirable place to hang out on the city's coolest street. He said, \\"That's my favorite spot on Central Avenue, that spot in the front of the Dunbar Hotel, because that to me was the hippest, most intimate, key spot of all the activity. That's where all the night people hung out: the sportsmen, the businessmen, the dancers, everybody in show business, people who were somebody stayed at the hotel. ... [B]y far that block, that Dunbar Hotel, for me was it. And it was it for, it seemed to me, everybody else. Sooner or later you walked in front of that hotel, and that's where everybody congregated.\\" Another writer recalled the area around the Dunbar as \\"a place where people love to congregate and have a good time, check out the new models and pick up on the latest lingo.\\" The Dunbar built a reputation in the 1930s as \\"the symbol of L.A.'s black nightlife,\\" as \\"regular jamming sessions and meetings in the hotel lobby elevated the structure to a practically mythical status.\\" Lionel Hampton had fond memories of jam sessions and practices on the Dunbar's mezzanine. Hampton recalled, \\"Everybody that was anybody showed up at the Dunbar. I remember a chauffeur would drive Stepin Fetchit, the movie star, up to the curb in a big Packard, and he'd look out the window at all the folks.\\" In his autobiography, Buck Clayton shared some of his memories of the Dunbar. He recalled the Dunbar as \\"jumping\\" with loads of people trying to get a glimpse of the celebrities, and parties thrown by Duke Ellington and his guys with \\"chicks and champagne everywhere.\\" Clayton recalled an instance when Ellington and his orchestra came to Los Angeles shortly after the 1932 release of the song It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing). Ellington's band was in the Dunbar restaurant when the song came on the jukebox. It was the first time since leaving New York that they had heard their recording. Clayton described the band's response: \\"So much rhythm I've never heard, as guys were beating on the tables, instrument cases or anything else they could beat on with knives, forks, rolled-up newspapers or anything else they could find to make rhythm. It was absolutely crazy.\\" The Dunbar was also known for its food. One musician recalled they \\"had good old southern-fried everything.\\" The Peace Mission years For a brief period during the Great Depression, the Dunbar was converted into a hostel for members of the Peace Mission Movement of Father Divine. In 1934, Lucius Lomax sold the hotel to the Peace Mission. The hotel staff was discharged, and the building was renovated as lodging for the mission's members. The Peace Mission Movement, run by Father Divine, operated a multi-racial religious colony at the Dunbar, with members using the dining room (formerly the site of a cabaret) for Holy Communion ceremonies. The Dunbar was sold to the Neslon family in the late 1930s, and it resumed its role as the cultural center of the Los Angeles black community. Deterioration and redevelopment Just as racial segregation had created a need for the Dunbar, racial integration in the 1950s eliminated the need. Duke Ellington, who had previously kept a suite at the Dunbar, began staying at the Chateau Marmont in Hollywood, and others followed. As one writer put it: \\"When the barriers against integration began to crumble in the late 1950s, so did the Dunbar Hotel.\\" Bernard Johnson bought the Dunbar in 1968, but the hotel continued to lose money, and Johnson closed the hotel's doors in 1974. While closed in 1974, comedian Rudy Ray Moore used the hotel extensively in his low-budget film Dolemite, and in 1976, the movie A Hero Ain't Nothin' but a Sandwich was filmed at the Dunbar. Owner Bernard Johnson also opened a museum of black culture for a time. But for most of the years from 1974 to 1987, the building was vacant and declined drastically, as transients began using it for shelter, and the building suffered from graffiti, broken windows and litter. A renovation effort was started in 1979, but stopped when city funding ceased. By 1987, the Dunbar was marred by graffiti and generally tarnished by neglect. That year, a plan was announced to convert the Dunbar into low-income housing units with a museum of black culture on the ground floor. The 115 hotel rooms on the top three floors were gutted and replaced with 72 apartments. The mezzanine, lobby and basement retained their original d√©cor and were converted into a museum and cultural center. The project was funded in large part with city redevelopment funds at a cost of $4.2 million. In 1990, the Dunbar re-opened as a 73-unit apartment building for low-income senior citizens and museum of black history. Delegates from the NAACP national convention helped rededicate the Dunbar in July 1990 following its renovation. Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley attended the rededication ceremony and praised the efforts to \\"breathe new life and vigor into this magnificent hotel.\\" The Dunbar hosted a jazz show in 1991, attended by noted music journalist Leonard Feather. Feather wrote that the event was like \\"a visit to a haunted house.\\" When one of the musicians played a Duke Ellington theme, Feather said \\"you could look up at the balcony and see, in your mind's eye, Duke himself at a piano on the mezzanine, working out an arrangement for tomorrow's show.\\" By 1997, the neighborhood around the Dunbar was 75% Latino, and by 2006 the neighborhood was predominantly Latino and poor, with most of the nearby storefronts having their signs written in Spanish. Designation as historic site In 1974, the Dunbar was designated as an Historic-Cultural Landmark (no. 131) by the city's Cultural Heritage Commission. The plaque called the hotel \\"an edifice dedicated to the memory and dignity of black achievement.\\" It was also added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. The Dunbar was also listed in the Green Book, a guide to African American travelers, from 1940-1956. This map pin shows the location. Extensive renovation The Dunbar was in such disrepair pigeons and rats were living in the vacated apartments and drug dealing was prevalent in the area some time after that. After the city foreclosed on the property, in partnership with Coalition for Responsible Community Development was selected through a competitive bidding process to redevelop the Dunbar Hotel. In approximately 2005 Blues entertainer Roy Gaines performed at the annual Jazz Festival and along with Deborah Dixon of the Southern California Blues Society they were interviewed and photographed in the hotel by the Los Angeles Times. It had been refurbished and was being occupied by then. In 2011, Dunbar Village L.P. was formed and purchased the buildings. The project included transforming the three existing buildings, the Dunbar Hotel, Somerville I and Somerville II, into one cohesive, activated, mixed-use, intergenerational community that honors South Los Angeles and the historic Dunbar Hotel.The new community is called Dunbar Village. Along with the physical renovation of the property was the community transformation. The first step in this transformation was securing the building from the gangs and drug dealers. The new owner installed a state-of-the-art camera system to help deter the rampant criminal activity occurring in the buildings. In a short time, this along with other security measures, helped to eliminate the frequent police visits to the property. Dunbar went from being one of the most visited properties by the police to a safe and secure community. Preserving Dunbar Hotel's historic brick facade, grand entry and lobby, the new design provides 41 residential units of affordable housing for seniors with amenities that include a community room, communal kitchen, media lounge, billiard table, library area and fitness room. In 2013, Councilwoman Jan Perry with many others attended the re-opening ceremony. \\"Central Avenue and the Dunbar Hotel have long been an important part of our Los Angeles history. It is wonderful to see the Avenue come alive again and know that this historic landmark will be restored for people to enjoy for generations to come,\\" said Councilwoman Perry, who led efforts to ensure that the Dunbar Hotel was redeveloped as part of an overall plan to revitalize the Central Avenue community. \\"Dunbar Village will preserve our shared history, create quality jobs for local youth, and offer much-needed affordable housing for families and seniors.\\" Together, Dunbar Village will have 83 units, including 41 senior units in the Dunbar Hotel and 42 affordable family units.

Ali Lakhani, (born 1955) is a writer, lawyer, and editor whose works focus on metaphysics and the perennial principles found in the wisdom traditions of the world. He is married to Nazlin N. Lakhani and lives in Vancouver, Canada. Biography Born in England in 1955, Lakhani was educated at The King's School, Canterbury before receiving his undergraduate and graduate degrees in law from Cambridge University. He immigrated to Vancouver in 1973, and was called to the Bar in British Columbia in 1979. He practises law in Vancouver as a trial lawyer. In 2015, he was conferred the designation of \\"Queen's Counsel\\" by the Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia to recognize his work as a lawyer. In 1998, he founded the Traditionalist journal, Sacred Web: A Journal of Tradition and Modernity. The bi-annual journal has included contributions by many leading traditionalists including Titus Burckhardt, Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, Jean-Louis Michon, Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Frithjof Schuon, Huston Smith, and the Prince of Wales. In 2001, Lakhani was invited to address the International Congress on Imam 'Ali in Iran where he presented his essay on The Metaphysics of Human Governance. This essay garnered the First Prize in English at the conferences and awarded at a special ceremony in Tehran in March 2002. A revised version of this essay is included in The Sacred Foundations of Justice in Islam. The anthology has been described by Professor Seyyed Hossein Nasr, as \\"among the best writings on this extraordinary figure in Western languages and are obligatory reading for anyone interested in ‚ÄòAli but not familiar with Islamic languages. In May 2016, at the invitation of the Temenos Academy, Lakhani presented a talk at the Royal Asiatic Society in London, England, titled ‚ÄòThe Integral Vision of the Aga Khan‚Äô. The talk focused on a question asked by the Aga Khan in 2006: \\"How, in an increasingly cynical time, can we inspire people to a new set of aspirations - reaching beyond rampant materialism, the new relativism, self- serving individualism, and resurgent tribalism?\\" Lakhani's book, Faith and Ethics: The Vision of the Ismaili Imamat was published by I.B. Tauris in association with The Institute of Ismaili Studies in 2018. The book examines how the ideas and actions of the current Ismaili Imam, and fourth Aga Khan, Prince Karim al-Husseini, provide an Islamic response to the challenges that face Muslims in the modern era. The book provides an extensive survey of the Aga Khan's aspirations, showing how the values of integrity and dignity are at the forefront of his work, with the traditional Muslim concepts of cosmopolitanism and social justice guiding his response to the stark challenges of the modern age.

Galbijjim at Doosan Encyclopedia History In traditional cuisine, galbijjim was traditionally eaten at Chuseok along with songpyeon, namul, taro soup, chestnut dumplings (Î∞§Îã®Ïûê), chicken jjim and autumn fruit. Lee, Jiho (Ïù¥ÏßÄÌò∏), Discussions of Korean Cuisine (ÌïúÍµ≠ ÏùåÏãùÎ°†), Gwangmungak, Seoul, 2002. As galbijjim is usually made from only the center part of ribs from a calf while the rib ends used to make soup stock, galbi was more expensive than other cuts of beef in South Korea, and has been regarded as a high-class dish. Preparation and serving Ribs are cut to size and excess blood should be removed. Knife cuts are made in the meat till the bone to allow seasoning to seep in. Surplus fat is removed from the ribs, either by cutting or removing after parboiling. Soy sauce, sesame oil, scallions, minced garlic, pepper, ground sesame with salt (Íπ®ÏÜåÍ∏à), ginger juice, and sugar are mixed together with the ribs and are simmered in a large pot on a mid-flame. The cooking is done slowly, occasionally stirring. When the meat is almost cooked, additional seasoning is added with jujube, ginkgo nuts, carrots, and pine nuts, and is boiled once again. Chestnuts, shiitake, and seogi mushrooms are added near the end of the dish. Galbijjim is usually served in a bowl rather than a plate and was traditionally served in a hap (Ìï©, bowl with cover).

Tea was first introduced to Korean royalty, and later reached the upper classes. Due to the region's climate, Korean farm land is unsuitable for the cultivation of tea, which made it difficult for the elite class to enjoy the foreign drink. Buddhist ceremonies were the most common times one would drink tea, making Bhuddist temples centers of Korean tea culture. The tea culture flourished during the Goryeo Dynasty (918‚Äì1392) and promoted the virtues of Buddhism. During the Joseon Dynasty (1392‚Äì1910), tea culture declined as the ruling class adopted Confucian doctrine. The tea culture from Korea eventually reached Japan, which embraced other cultural influences. Hardships of farming not only affected men, but women as well who looked after children and prepared meals after a long day of working in the fields. The government designated one day each month where culinary delicacies were prepared as a way to promote a healthy family life and to free women from some of their daily burden. These monthly celebrations included Seollal, New Year's, the first day of the first lunar month and Chuseok, Harvest Moon Festival, the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month, when the harvest begins, making it the most abundant time of the year. During these holidays, ancestors were honored with food offerings and would pour alcoholic beverages in a ceremony called charye, a name that came from serving tea or cha to ancestors. The offerings included meat, fish, fruit, and special delicacies, often decorated elaborately. Gokcha, a type of wine and was sometimes used instead of tea. Now, wine is more included instead of traditional tea. With families that emphasize formality, the color of the dasik is carefully chosen. The desired taste, color and texture are taken into account during the process of selecting the ingredients and the processing. Dasik arrangements are by color, served on a serving plate that reflects the artistic sense of the host and it sets the tone of the celebration.Koo Chun-sur (2002) Dasik: A Unique Delicacy to Accompany Tea Koreana A Quarterly on Korean Art & Culture web:http://koreana.kf.or.kr/view.asp?article_id=4606‚ü®=English Retrieved on 7 November 2014 Dasikpan Dasik is shaped with a wooden or porcelain press that forms a patterned confectionery.

It was constructed in a utilitarian commercial style with reinforced concrete. Even though this particular style was common for cities in the midwest and east coast, the building style was a stark contrast for Bellingham's sandstone and rounded arch buildings. The Bellingham National Bank occupied the building starting on December 1, 1913.Bellingham National Bank Building (1912-1913) - City of Belligham, WA Key Bank of Washington occupied the first floor until May 8, 2009. Starting in February 2011, The Stamp & Coin Place, a local bullion and coin trading shop, will occupy the space. The upper-offices are leased to various businesses and government offices, including the Washington State Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals and the Washington State Attorney General's Office. History The bank The Bellingham National Bank was formed in 1904 by a group of local capitalists led by Victor Roeder. It opened for business on January 3, 1905 in the corner store-room of the Clover Block on the corner of Holly and Commercial Streets.\\"Bellingham National Bank Will Open Soon\\" The Bellingham Herald 2 Jan. 1905. Pg. 4. The small bank soon grew to become one of the most prominent banks in Bellingham and began searching for larger quarters by the end of the decade. In March 1912, the bank purchased the Southeast corner of Dock and Holly Streets for $175,000. The site was occupied by several wooden buildings dating to the late 19th century including the Beck Hotel, built on the corner in 1888 by David Beck who would later build the adjoining theater. The parameters of the property were described in the local paper: The bank announced their plans to build a $200,000, 6 story brick and concrete building on the lot that would be one of the finest in the Northwest. The bank would occupy the ground floor corner of the building, a frontage of about 50 feet on Holly, while the rest of the building would contain offices above and retail stores on the ground floor. Demolition and then construction would begin by June of the same year.\\"Dock and Holly to Get Six Story Bank Building\\" Bellingham Herald 18 Mar. 1912. Pg. 4. Design and construction The bank hired Bellingham architect F. Stanley Piper to design the building who in turn hired C.H. Beattie of Seattle as the general contractor. Work began at a quick pace and by February 1913, the concrete structure of the building was complete with laying of the brick facing about to begin. Each of the building's 124 rooms was to be equipped with hot and cold running water as well as access to the building's vacuum system. Other modern features would include two high-speed elevators and a mail chute. The first two stories were clad with Wilkeson sandstone, with the upper four clad in light buff-colored pressed brick. From the top of the fourth-floor windows to the parapet line was clad with terra cotta. The interior corridors featured terrazzo floors with panels and borders of Alaskan marble. The vestibule was adorned with an 11 foot high marble dado of Colorado Yeul while the columns in the vestibule were of genuine Italian Pavonazzo marble. Materials used in the banking room included Alaskan and Kasota marble, Honduran mahogany, and Calamine brass for doors.\\"New Bank to be Opened in July; Work on New Building Bellingham National is Rushed\\" Bellingham Herald 17 Feb. 1913. Pg. 8. By August 1913, the building was complete and tenants began to move including doctors, dentists and other professionals. The bank officially opened on December 1, 1913.

The house, in which Stefan Zweig and his second wife Lotte resided for 5 months until their joint suicide in February 1942 and where the author had revised his autobiography Die Welt von Gestern and drafted Schachnovelle and his essays about Montaigne, was bought by the association \\"Casa Stefan Zweig\\" and the architect Miguel Pinto Guimar√£es was commissioned with the renovation and the redesign of the house into a museum. The museum is dedicated to the author. He, like other artists, scholars, and scientists from Europe had fled to Brazil, due to the Nazi Party takeover in Germany. The museum will accommodate a library as well as a conference hall. Beside exhibitions, conferences, competitions, theater and cinema performances, readings and concerts, also cooperations with partner organisations like the Internationale Stefan Zweig Gesellschaft, are planned. Scientists as well as the general public should have the opportunity, to retrieve online information about Zweig, his work and his literature written in exile. They should furthermore have the opportunity to contribute their own ideas. For this purpose, a bilingual web page will be created by the Casa Stefan Zweig, which will be updated constantly. The First president of the association Casa Stefan Zweig is the Brazilian journalist and Stefan Zweig biographer, Alberto Dines.

She lives in Brighton, England. Along with Candida Royalle, Annie Sprinkle, Maria Beatty, and others, she is one of the pioneers of the movement to make pornography for women. Her genre is described as \\"art-core,\\" meaning the focus is on sexuality from the female perspective, female pleasure, and creative, sensual play. Common themes in her erotic films include safe sex, men seen as sexual objects, female fantasies, and male bisexuality.  Background  Joy holds a master's degree in Film History from the University of Cologne. In 1990, she wrote her thesis on the representation of female sexuality in Nazi films. After graduation, she moved to England, where she worked for 10 years as a freelance producer and director for German television. Joy has directed and produced over 70 documentaries for international TV stations such as Channel 4, National Geographic, and WDR. Since 1990, the main focus of her work has been lifestyle and sexuality. A recurring topic was sexuality from a female perspective. Starting in 1992, she produced segments for ‚ÄúLiebe S√ºnde‚Äù, a programme about sex airing on the German satellite station Vox/Pro7. In 2003, Joy launched Strawberry Seductress, an intimate and creative erotic photo service for women and couples and film production company. In 2004, Joy filmed Sexual Sushi, her first alternative pornographic film for women. Harper Collins published her book How to Make Your Own Adult Video: The Couple‚Äôs Guide to Making Sensual Home Movies in 2006. She then shot Female Fantasies and Feeling it, not faking it!. In 2009, Joy established the Petra Joy Award, an international erotic film competition for first-time female directors. She runs ‚Äúhow to make your own creative porn‚Äù workshops and speaks on the subject of women and pornography across Europe. Joy curates and produces a feminist porn series called Her Porn and has shot a documentary called The Joy of Porn: My Life as a Feminist Pornographer.  Erotic Film Production  Joy started producing and directing erotic films in 2004 with the aim to show a more accurate reflection of female sexuality than mainstream porn filmmakers. She works exclusively with amateur performers, with the intention of capturing real chemistry, always shows safe sex, and has a policy never to show acts that can be perceived as being degrading to women. In contrast to mainstream porn that often focuses on shots of genitalia, Joy focused on the faces of the performers. Authentic sex scenes, men as sex objects, elaborate costumes, and taboo themes such as females penetrating males, and male bisexuality often feature in her films. Of her first erotic film, Sexual Sushi, one reviewer wrote, ‚ÄúPetra has achieved her aim of creating an antidote to ‚Äòporn junk food‚Äô‚Äù. She describes her inspiration as follows: ‚Äú... [C]ommercially successful porn does nothing for me: I want porn that stimulates the mind and feeds the soul. I want porn that is educational and inspirational. I want porn that is creative and kinky. And because I cannot find it anywhere, I make my own. I am a visual creature and enjoy expressing myself through photos and films that are very different from mainstream glamour photography and porn films.‚Äù In 2009, she curated and produced the first installment of the Her Porn series with the aim of showing a variety of female erotic visions. Her Porn 2 is to be released in April 2010. She also acts as a distributor for other female directors. Her films have been shown at New York City‚Äôs Cinekink festival, the pornfilmfest Berlin, and at the British Film Institute. The Petra Joy Award The Petra Joy Awards were founded by Petra Joy in October 2009 to encourage first-time erotic female filmmakers and to help the genre of porn from a female perspective thrive. Sponsored by German personal lubricant manufacturer \\"pjur\\", the inaugural theme was ‚ÄúWhat is erotic to you?‚Äù. Submissions came from Australia, America, the Netherlands, England, Spain and Austria. The winning films premiered at the Movimento cinema in Berlin during Berlin's pornfilmfest. In addition to cash prizes, the winning films were included on the first volume of Joy's compilation of erotic female filmmakers Her Porn. 2009 Winners: * First Prize - Louise Lush, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs What I Like‚Äù * Second Prize - Lola Clavo, ‚ÄúLa Lucha‚Äù * Third Prize - Linsey Satterthwaite, ‚ÄúI Like It When‚Äù * Special Jury Award - Cora Emens, ‚ÄúCora‚Äôs Memoirs‚ÄîThe Rose‚Äù Professional honours and awards * 2004 Erotic Award - Photographer of the Year * 2007 FICEB Award - Best Softcore Film (Female Fantasies - Strawberries Seductress)\\"Winners of the 2007 FICEB Ninfa Awards\\", h.b., October 10, 2007, xstarsnews.com.

Some are prehistoric rock art, probably of Fremont culture origin. Others are probably modern, depicting horses, for example. And some are perhaps of very recent origin, most likely the work of white explorers, settlers, and/or tourists. There is a great deal of graffiti near the main panel that is obviously of fairly recent origin. The majority of the panel is covered with a dark desert varnish which contrasts nicely with the light sandstone that is exposed when the petroglyphs are pecked into the surface. There are several sections of very light stone in the center of the panel where it appears some of original stone was removed, probably by collectors who were after the figures inscribed there. The panel is located 3 miles east of Emery, Utah but is accessed via a graded road coming from a turnoff to the north, near the town of Moore. To get to the panel drive to the turnoff between mile markers 16 and 17 on highway 10 between the towns of Emery and Ferron. Take the paved road heading east to Moore for about half a mile. Turn south onto a well-graded road and drive for about 4 miles, passing a radio tower on the way.

He was subsequently named by the United Nations Mission in Kosovo as the International Administrator of one of the Municipal Districts of Kosovo and later served on active duty as Deputy J9 at the Headquarters of KFOR in Pristina, Kosovo.

Civilian service in Afghanistan and Homeland Defense After retiring in 2006, he was selected and appointed in 2008 to serve as a Senior Executive civilian government official as the assistant Inspector General for Inspections within the newly created Office of the Special Inspector general for Afghanistan Reconstruction. In this position he assisted in standing up this new congressionally created agency charged with reporting to the American people where over $104 billion of reconstruction money has been spent in Afghanistan since 2001. This position took him throughout Afghanistan during 2009 and resulted in the publishing of numerous reports of inspections on various projects.

This sept had their royal seat at Maistiu (Mullaghmast) in the south of modern County Kildare. He was the son of Cellach mac Brain (died 834), a previous king.Byrne, Table 9 The succession of kings in Leinster is difficult to follow in his time. The king lists in the Book of Leinster have Lorc√°n succeed Ruarc mac Brain (died 862) of the U√≠ D√∫nchada sept and followed by T√∫athal mac M√°ele-Brigte (died 854). According to these lists Ruarc ruled for 9 years (c.838-847) and T√∫athal for 3 (c.851-854). Lorc√°n's reign then corresponds to c.847-851.Book of Leinster: Rig Laigin Francis John Byrne suggests that the root of this apparent confusion lay in the fact that the U√≠ D√∫nlainge kings exercised little real authority due to the aggressions of their western neighbour Cerball mac D√∫nlainge (died 888), King of Osraige. Cerball, while unable to install himself as king of Leinster, was able to prevent any rival king exercising real power there.Byrne, pg.163 In 848 Lorc√°n led the Laigin in alliance with √ìlchobar mac Cin√°eda (died 851) in a victory over the Vikings in the Battle of Sciath Nechtain near modern Castledermot, County Kildare, in which fell the jarl Tomrair.Annals of Ulster, AU 848.5 Lorc√°n's father Cellach had also been aligned with Munster during the reign of Feidlimid mac Cremthanin (died 847).

It is the largest island in Fujian and the fifth-largest island administered by the People's Republic of China. History In June 1955, there was considerable road and military construction around Haitan Island, including roads leading to possible artillery positions on the mainland. These positions might have been used to protect the Haitan Strait, which was thought of as a favorable staging area for amphibious operations against the Matsu Islands. The site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List in 2001, under Haitan Scenic Spots, in the Mixed category (Cultural & Natural).Haitan Scenic Spots - UNESCO World Heritage Centre; added to Tentative List on November 29, 2001. Geography Administratively, the island is part of Pingtan County, which includes several smaller islands and part of the nearby mainland. Most of the county's towns, including its seat of government at Tancheng, are on the island. Large areas of the island's coast have undergone land reclamation, along with major building and infrastructure projects.Cf. especially the historical imagery timeline available for Google Earth. Pingtan is separated from mainland China by the Haitan Strait. Most of the nearby mainland is the county-level city of Fuqing, administered as part of the prefecture-level city of Fuzhou. Pingtan is separated from Taiwan Island by the Taiwan Strait. Following the completion of its bridge to the mainland in 2010, Pingtan may be considered the closest part of the Chinese \\"mainland\\" to Taiwan Island. Under current international agreement, the island's southernmost extremity forms the boundary between the East and South China Seas. In the still-unapproved draft of the new edition of the IHO's Limits of Oceans and Seas, the northernmost extremity of the islandforms the boundary between the East China Sea and the Taiwan Strait, with the South China Sea having its northern boundary moved to the south end of the strait. Economy The island relies on tourism and anticipates that foreign investment will spur economic growth. The first major bridge to cross the Haitan Strait was completed in November 2010, connecting the island to Fuqing on the mainland. Spanning 4,976 meters, it cost 1.4 billion RMB (about US$200 million) to build. An 88.5-km-long Fuzhou-Pingtan Railway (the Fuping Railway, Á¶èÂπ≥ÈìÅË∑Ø), connecting Fuzhou to Pingtan Island, via Changle and a series of bridges, is under construction. The project was approved in November 2012. It was expected that the work would start by the end of the year, and would take about five and a half years.Á¶èÂ∑ûËá≥Âπ≥ÊΩ≠ÈìÅË∑ØÂèØÁ†îÊä•ÂëäËé∑ÂèëÊîπÂßîÊâπÂ§ç, 2012-11-10 In early 2012, it was announced that a large cloud computing center would be built in Pingtan. Culture A museum, the Pingtan Art Museum, is currently under construction in the island. The museum, designed by the Chinese-American firm MAD Studio on an artificial island, is scheduled for completion in 2016.

Brown is perhaps best known for his collaboration with the organizational theorist Elliott Jaques on the Glacier Project, which Peter Drucker called \\"the most extensive study of actual worker behavior in large-scale industry\\". Sponsored by Glacier Metal Company and its Works Council during Brown's leadership, the project ran from 1948 to 1965, resulting in the development or discovery of felt-fair pay, stratified systems theory, timespan of discretion, levels of work, product pricing analysis and career progression trajectories. These ideas were described in the various books and articles written by Brown and Jaques. (See Bibliography.) Brown later attempted to use these processes in governmental affairs as a member of the House of Lords. An advocate of practical learning for managers, Brown created the Glacier Institute of Management. He served as the first Chairman of Acton Technical College's Governing Body, Chairman of Brunel University from 1949 to 1965, and Pro-Chancellor of Brunel from 1965 to 1980. Although he never attended university, Brown received honorary degrees from Brunel University (DTech, 1966), Southern Illinois University (Doctor of Laws, 1967) and Cranfield University (DSc, 1972). He was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1943 Birthday Honours and made a life peer as Baron Brown, of Machrihanish, in the County of Argyll, on 22 December 1964.

The identity is used most notably by Jimmy Zafar. Fictional character biography Disillusioned by the justice system and what they viewed as its lenient stance on crime, a number of New York City Police Department officers came together to form an organization that would permanently kill criminals, rather than simply jailing them. Calling themselves the \\"Cabal\\", the group commissioned Stane International to give them an edge in their crusade. Stane's company designed and manufactured a suit of powered armor for them, the \\"Savage Steel\\" battlesuit, based on technology stolen from Stark Enterprises. Different members of the Cabal all took turns wearing the resulting powered armor, including Paul Trent and former members Harry Lennox, Johnny Leone, and Jimmy Zafar. Savage Steel was first seen battling Darkhawk, and killed some drug dealers.Darkhawk #4 Savage Steel then tried to kill the Punisher, then battled the Punisher, Darkhawk, and weapons dealers.Darkhawk #9 Savage Steel attacked Phillippe Bazin during his trial, and was revealed as Harry Lennox.Darkhawk #12 It was revealed how the Cabal created the Savage Steel identity, and the Cabal was defeated by Darkhawk and most of its members taken into custody.Darkhawk #15 The Savage Steel armor was then stolen by police van driver Arthur Vale, who adopted the Savage Steel identity. Vale attempted to gain new weaponry, but was defeated by Iron Man, who targeted the Savage Steel armor in an attempt to regain his stolen technology, and then deactivated the armor.Darkhawk Annual #1 Jimmy Zafar rescued the imprisoned Vale and Lennox from the Cabal, and faked their deaths and his own. With Vale, Lennox, and Leone, Zafar joined the Witness Relocation Program.Darkhawk Annual #1 Zafar later stole the rebuilt armor from renegade Stane technicians, and adopted the Savage Steel identity.Darkhawk Annual #2 With Darkhawk as an ally, the new Savage Steel battled terrorists.Darkhawk #32 He later attempted to aid Darkhawk against an invasion of Mahari space pirates led by Overhawk, but was knocked out of the fight. He met up with Darkhawk and his other allies after the battle.Darkhawk #50 The Initiative Jimmy Zafar was considered as a \\"potential recruit\\" for the Initiative program, according to Civil War: Battle Damage Report. Original Sin A version of the Savage Steel armor was obtained through unknown means by a criminal. This man was stopped after a robbery by the Black Knight who nearly killed him during a bout of instability caused by the Ebony Blade.Original Sins #2 Powers and abilities The Savage Steel armor, constructed and modified by former Stane International engineers based on designs stolen from Tony Stark, is an armored battlesuit which serves as an exoskeleton greatly amplifying the user's strength. The armor is equipped with hand-blasters firing multi-directional high-frequency electrical bolts, and also comes with gas grenades, flares, sonic weaponry, a targeting computer, a self-contained air supply for one hour, and boot jets which allow flight.

It was built with the intent of bringing an old time circus to everyone; it is billed as one of the world's biggest traveling circuses still using a big top tent. Owned and operated by Tab√°res Entertainment, the circus produces a truck circus show throughout the western United States; thanks to the closing of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus in 2017, their tour expanded to the rest of the country. History Clifford E. Vargas (1924‚Äì1989) founded Circus Vargas in 1969. Vargas was influenced to restart the big top tent circus from his childhood fascination with glamour and thrills of old circuses. He was a frequent spectator with big top tent circuses that visited his hometown of Livermore, California every year. Vargas, the son of Portuguese immigrants, grew up on a farm near Livermore. He got a job in Chicago as the ticket seller, doorman and later ringmaster. Vargas saved money, and in 1972 purchased controlling interest in the Miller-Johnson Circus. The show was small to start, but grew. Circus Vargas at its peak was using the largest circus tent, the size of a football field, which took thirty men seven hours to raise.LA Times, Clifford E.

Bailey sold his interest to concession manager Roland Kaiser. Kaiser and Muscarello, both longtime friends of Vargas and management executives with the show, began managing the circus. Faced with rising costs and declining attendance, Kaiser and Muscarello changed the circus into a more intimate one-ring 'European style' circus. They ran the circus until retiring in 2003. Circus Vargas then went on hiatus while looking for a buyer. In 2005, Nelson & Katya Quiroga (n√©e Arata) became United States citizens, and founded their production company, Tabares Entertainment, Inc. They now present Circus Vargas. In 2010, Circus Vargas discontinued its animal acts. Circus Vargas History Since March 2020, all shows were cancelled caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Unification Church of the United States, sometimes colloquially referred to as the \\"Moonies\\", is a religious movement in the United States of America. It began in the 1950s and 1960s when missionaries from Japan and South Korea were sent to the United States by the international Unification movement's founder and leader Sun Myung Moon. It expanded in the 1970s and then became involved in controversy due to its theology, its political activism, and the lifestyle of its members. Since then it has been involved in many areas of American society and has established businesses, news media, projects in education and the arts as well as taking part in political and social activism, and has itself gone through substantial changes. Early history In the late 1950s and early 1960s missionaries from the Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity (HSA-UWC) of South Korea and Japan came to the United States. Among them were Young Oon Kim, Sang Ik-Choi, Bo Hi Pak, David S. C. Kim, and Yun Soo Lim. Missionary work took place in Washington D.C., New York, Oregon, and California.A History of the Unification Church in America, 1959‚Äì1974: Emergence of a National Movement, Michael L. Mickler, 1987, New York: Garland, . The Unification Church first came to public notice in the United States after sociology student John Lofland studied Young Oon Kim's group and published his findings as a doctoral thesis entitled: The World Savers: A Field Study of Cult Processes, which was published in 1966 in book form by Prentice-Hall as Doomsday Cult: A Study of Conversion, Proselytization, and Maintenance of Faith. This book is considered to be one of the most important and widely cited studies of the process of religious conversion, and one of the first modern sociological studies of a new religious movement.Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America: African diaspora traditions and other American innovations, Volume 5 of Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America, W.

Barker could find no evidence that Moonie recruits were ever kidnapped, confined, or coerced. Participants at Moonie retreats were not deprived of sleep; the lectures were not \\"trance- inducing\\"; and there was not much chanting, no drugs or alcohol, and little that could be termed \\"frenzy\\" or \\"ecstatic\\" experience. People were free to leave, and leave they did. Barker's extensive enumerations showed that among the recruits who went so far as to attend two-day retreats (claimed to be the Moonie's most effective means of \\"brainwashing\\"), fewer than 25% joined the group formore than a week and only 5% remained full-time members one year later. And, of course, most contacts dropped out before attending a retreat. Of all those who visited a Moonie centre at least once, not one in two-hundred remained in the movement two years later. With failure rates exceeding 99.5%, it comes as no surprise that full-time Moonie membership in the U.S. never exceeded a few thousand. And this was one of the most successful New Religious Movements of the era!\\" Scholars have attributed the Unification Church's relative success in the United States, as compared to other Western nations, to its support of patriotism and capitalist values, and to its multi-racial membership.Regulating Religion: Case Studies from Around the Globe (Google eBook), James T.

Many of these members are attractive, well-educated graduates from some of our finest colleges and universities. Their membership in the movement should remind us that for the young adult (18‚Äì25 years of age) conversion has a highly ideological and vocational dimension.\\" Some commentators have also noted that this period of Unification Church growth in the United States took place just as the \\"hippie\\" era of the late 1960s and early 1970s was ending, when many American young people were looking for a sense of higher purpose or community in their lives.Moon at Twilight , The New Yorker September 14, 1998, \\"David Bromley, a professor of sociology and religious studies at Virginia Commonwealth University, who has co-written a book about the Unification Church, believes that the bulk of Moon's remaining followers were recruited in the seventies, when both the establishment and the counterculture were falling apart.

He then asked church members to help him in a series of outreach campaigns in which he spoke to public audiences in all 50 states, ending with a 1976 rally in Washington D.C. in which he spoke on the grounds of the Washington Monument to around 300,000 people.Introvigne 2000 pages 13‚Äì16 During this time many church members left school and careers to devote their full-time to church work. \\"Mobile fundraising teams\\" (often called MFT) were set up to raise money for church projects, sometimes giving candy or flowers in exchange for donations.Moon-struck, Time, October 15, 1973, \\"The core members‚Äîmost in their 20s, many of them converts from other spiritual, psychological or political trips‚Äîdisplay a dogged devotion that makes even Jehovah's Witnesses look like backsliders.

Church buildings were purchased around the nation. In New York State the Belvedere Estate, the Unification Theological Seminary, and the New Yorker Hotel were purchased.

He was born in what is now North Korea and had been imprisoned by the North Korean communist government during the Korean War, and believed that the defeat of communism by democracy was a necessary step in the Divine Providence to establish the Kingdom of God on earth. Divine Principle, Introduction. \\"Nonetheless, one final and inescapable conflict remains before us, the war between democracy and communism. Although each side has equipped itself with fearsome weapons and is pitted against the other in readiness for battle, the core of their conflict is internal and ideological. Which side will triumph in this final ideological conflict? Anyone who believes in the reality of God will surely answer that democracy will win.\\"Beyond the Dark Side of the Moonies, Andrew Brown, The Independent, November 2, 1995, \\"The Moonies were - and remain - intent on halting communism. Moon founded the Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity in Korea in 1954. The first missionaries were sent out in the Fifties, but only after Moon moved to the US in the Seventies did the movement start to become visible in the West. Moon's followers believe he is the Messiah who can lead the way to establishing the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth. Their beliefs are set out in the Divine Principle, which contains interpretations of the Old and New Testaments with further revelations from Moon himself. Devotees believe God's victory over Satan requires the defeat of atheistic communism. To this end they have sponsored large numbers of conferences for journalists, theologians, academics, politicians and anyone else they think might contribute to establishing a God-centred world.\\" In 1974 Moon asked church members to support President Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal when Nixon was being pressured to resign his office. Church members prayed and fasted in support of Nixon for three days in front of the United States Capitol, under the motto: \\"Forgive, Love and Unite.\\" On February 1, 1974 Nixon publicly thanked them for their support and officially received Moon. This brought the church into widespread public and media attention.Introvigne, 2000 page 16 The Unification Church of the United States sponsored other anti-communist activities during the 1970s and 1980s, including the multi-national organization CAUSA International.Introvigne, 2000, page 18Sun Myung Moon's Followers Recruit Christians to Assist in Battle Against Communism Christianity Today June 15, 1985 In 1982 Moon founded the conservative newspaper The Washington Times, in Washington D.C., as part of News World Communications, an international news media conglomerate which also publishes newspapers in South Korea, Japan, and South America. Although never a financial success, the Times was well-read in conservative and anti- communist circles and was credited by President Ronald Reagan with helping to win the Cold War.Gorenfeld, John, Dear Leader's Paper Moon The American Prospect 2005-09-19 \\"The American people know the truth. You, my friends at The Washington Times, have told it to them. It wasn't always the popular thing to do. But you were a loud and powerful voice.

And -- oh, yes -- we won the Cold War.\\" -Reagan, 1997 In 1983 church members publicly protested against the Soviet Union over its shooting down of Korean Airlines Flight 007. San Francisco Chronicle September 3, 1983 \\"For a second day, the Soviet Consulate in Pacific Heights was the scene of emotional protests against the shooting down of a Korean Air Lines jumbo jet. About 300 people held demonstration yesterday morning. Among them were members of the Unification Church, or \\"Moonies,\\" whose founder is the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, the controversial South Korean who has melded a fierce anti-communism into his ideology. Eldridge Cleaver, the onetime black radical who recently has had ties with the Moonies, spoke at the rally. Many pickets carried signs accusing the Soviet Union of murdering the 269 passengers and crew aboard the airliner. In another development, San Francisco attorney Melvin Belli filed a $109 billion lawsuit against the Soviet Union on behalf of the 269 victims.\\" In 1984, church member Dan Fefferman founded the International Coalition for Religious Freedom in Virginia, which is active in protesting what it considers to be threats to religious freedom by governmental agencies. In 1986 conservative author William Rusher wrote: \\"The members the Reverend Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church, now almost universally referred to as 'Moonies,' constitute a fascinating problem for outsiders--and perhaps above all for conservatives, because they are so unabashedly anti-Communist and pro-American.\\"Review of The Making of a Moonie, William Rusher, National Review, December 19, 1986. Criticism, opposition, and controversy The Unification Church of the United States was met with widespread criticism beginning in the early 1970s. The main points of criticism were the church's unorthodox theology, especially the belief that Moon is the second coming of Christ; the church's political involvement; and the extreme lifestyle of most members, which involved full- time dedication to church activities often at the neglect of family, school, and career. During this time, hundreds of parents of members used the services of deprogrammers to remove their children from church membership and the activities of the church were widely reported in the media, most often in a negative light.Introvigne, 2000, pages 16‚Äì17 In 1975 Steven Hassan left the church and later became an outspoken critic.

Fraser of Minnesota.Introvigne, 2000. page 17 (see also: Koreagate, Fraser Committee) In 1982 the United States Supreme Court struck down a Minnesota law which had imposed registration and reporting requirements on those religions that receive more than half of their contributions from nonmembers as being contrary to the First Amendment of the United States Constitution's protection of religious freedom and prohibition of state establishment of religion. The law was seen as especially targeting the Unification Church.A crumbling wall between CHURCH and STATE?, Christian Science Monitor, June 2, 1982Equal rights for Moonies, Time, May 3, 1982 In 1982, Moon was convicted in United States federal court of willfully filing false Federal income tax returns and conspiracy. In 1984 and 1985, while he was serving his sentence in Federal Correctional Institution, Danbury, Connecticut, American Unification Church members launched a public-relations campaign claiming that the charges against him were unjust and politically motivated. Booklets, letters and videotapes were mailed to approximately 300,000 Christian leaders. Many signed petitions protesting the government's case.Why Are Pastors Flying to Moon? Christianity Today August 1, 2001. Among the American Christian leaders who spoke out in defense of Moon were conservative Jerry Falwell, head of Moral Majority, and liberal Joseph Lowery, head of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.Introvigne, 2000, pages 23‚Äì25 Michael Tori, a professor at Marist College (Poughkeepsie, New York) suggested that Moon's conviction helped the Unification Church gain more acceptance in mainstream American society, since it showed that he was financially accountable to the government and the public.Church urges Christian unity: Valley seminary open since 1975 Poughkeepsie Journal, 2003-12-11\\"Michael Tori, a professor in Marist College's religious studies program, said the Unification Church has gained more acceptance in mainstream society for several reasons. One reason was Rev. Moon's indictment in the early 1980s for tax evasion. The indictment showed Moon was financially accountable to the government and to the public, Tori said. Another reason the church has gained greater acceptance is that it has taken on several universally accepted causes such as the importance of family values in society and the formation of the Interreligious and International Peace Council. The church has also given financial support to institutions such as the University of Bridgeport in Connecticut and made acquisitions such as the purchase of the Washington Times.\\"(see also: United States vs. Sun Myung Moon) Changes in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s On July 1, 1982 a large number of the members of the Unification Church of the United States were married by Rev. and Mrs. Moon in a Blessing ceremony (sometimes called a \\"mass wedding\\") in Madison Square Garden in New York City. The total number of couples who took part was 2075, some coming from other countries. Soon after other American members were married in ceremonies in South Korea. Most who took part were matched with their future spouses by Moon. Many couples were international or interracial. Before this most American church members had been single and living celibately.Introvigne, 2000, pages 47‚Äì48 Moon's practice of matching couples was very unusual in both Christian tradition and in modern Western culture and attracted much attention and controversy.The men and women entered a large room, where Moon began matching couples by pointing at them.\\"NY Daily News \\"In the Unification tradition, romantic liaisons are forbidden until the members are deemed by Mr. Moon to be spiritually ready to be matched at a huge gathering where he points future spouses out to one another. His followers believe that his decisions are based on his ability to discern their suitability and see their future descendants. Many are matched with people of other races and nationalities, in keeping with Mr. Moon's ideal of unifying all races and nations in the Unification Church. Though some couples are matched immediately before the mass wedding ceremonies, which are held every two or three years, most have long engagements during which they are typically posted in different cities or even continents, and get to know one another through letters.\\"NY Times \\"Many were personally matched by Moon, who taught that romantic love led to sexual promiscuity, mismatched couples and dysfunctional societies. Moon's preference for cross-cultural marriages also meant that couples often shared no common language.\\"Manchester Guardian \\"Moon's death Sept. 2 and funeral Saturday signaled the end of the random pairings that helped make Moon's Unification Church famous ‚Äî and infamous ‚Äî a generation ago.\\" Washington Post \\"Many of the couples who married at mass weddings were hand-picked by Moon from photos. It led to some strange pairs such as a 71-year-old African Catholic archbishop who wed a 43-year-old Korean acupuncturist. In 1988 Moon entered the Guinness Book of Records when he married 6,516 identically dressed couples at Seoul's Olympic Stadium. Moonie newly-weds were forbidden to sleep together for 40 days to prove their marriage was on a higher plane. They then had to consummate their marriage in a three-day ritual with the sexual positions stipulated by their leader.\\"Daily Mirror Thousands of couples have been placed in marriages by religious leaders with people they had barely met, since Moon taught that romantic love led to sexual promiscuity. Their mass arranged marriage events have gained international public attention. Critics have stated that some of these marriages end in divorce, which is discouraged by the church. Also in the 1980s Moon instructed church members to take part in a program called \\"Home Church\\" in which they reached out to neighbors and community members through public service.Patrick Hickey Tahoe Boy: A journey back home John, Maryland, Seven Locks Press (May 15, 2009) pages 163-168 Unification Church business interests, which had begun in the 1960s, expanded in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s (decade).

Massimo Introvigne, who has studied the Unification Church and other new religious movements, has said that this confirms that full-time membership is no longer considered crucial to church members.Introvigne, 2000, page 19 In 1997 Dr. Sontag commented: \\"There's no question their numbers are way down.

The FFWPU would include members of various religious organizations working toward common goals, especially on issues of sexual morality and reconciliation between people of different religions, nations, and races. The FFWPU co-sponsored the Million Family March in 2000, the Global Peace Festival in the late 2000s (decade), and blessing ceremonies in which thousands of married couples of different faith backgrounds were given the marriage blessing previously given only to HSA-UWC members.Introvigne, 2000, pages 47‚Äì52Thousands rally at million family march - racially and religiously diverse gathering, Christian Century, 2000-11-1 In 2009 Sun Myung Moon's daughter In Jin Moon became president of the FFWPU of the United States.

These include the derogatory term \\"Moonies\\",*Oxford English Dictionary*WordNet¬Æ 3.0, ¬© 2006 by Princeton University a special use of the word \\"indemnity\\",Daske, D. and Ashcraft, W. 2005, New Religious Movements, New York: New York University Press, \\"To restart the process toward perfection, God has sent messiahs to earth who could restore the true state of humanity's relationship with God. Before that can happen, however, humans must perform good deeds that cancel the bad effects of sin. Unificationists call this \\"indemnity\\". Showing love and devotion to one's fellow humans, especially within families, helps pay this indemnity.\\" p142Yamamoto, J. 1995, Unification Church, Grand Rapids, Michigan: Zondervan Press, \\"The doctrine of indemnity. Indemnity is that which people do to restore themselves to God's kingdom. Young Oon Kim describes it this way: 'We atone for our sins through specific acts of penance.' Kwang-Yol Yoo, a Unification teacher, even goes so far as to say that by following the Divine Principle, 'man's perfection must be accomplished by his own effort without God's help.' God does most of the work, but people must still do their part in order to achieve God's plan of salvation: 'Five percent is only to say that man's responsibility is extremely small compared to God's.' \\"p35 \\"The doctrine of indemnity is not biblical. 'In simple language.' states Ruth Tucker, 'indemnity is salvation by works.' Bob Larson makes a distinction between Moon's doctrine and biblical theology, saying, 'Moon's doctrine of sinless perfection by \\"indemnity [forgiveness of sin by works on Moon's behalf], which can apply even to deceased ancestors, is a denial of the salvation by grace offering through Jesus Christ.' 'Farewell,' said John Calvin. 'to the dream of those who think up a righteousness flowing together out of faith and works.'\\" p40Tingle, D. and Fordyce, R. 1979, The Phases and Faces of the Moon: A Critical Examination of the Unification Church and Its Principles, Hicksville, New York: Exposition Press p53-55 \\"In short, indemnity is anything you want to make it, since you establish the conditions. The zeal and enthusiasm of the Unification Church members is not so much based on love for God as it is compulsion to indemnify one's own sins.\\"THE POWER OF THE PRINCIPLE: WHENCE IT CAME; WHERE IT WENT Richard Quebedeaux, \\"Rev. Moon calls such a mode of living, such a lifestyle, \\"restoration through indemnity.\\" With indemnity viewed as a persistent pattern of behavior, not as a mere doctrine to be affirmed or a rational list of rules, God's ideal for human relationships is \\"restored\\" through restitution.

Moonie The word \\"Moonie\\" was first used by the American news media in the 1970s when Sun Myung Moon moved to the United States and came to public notice. It became prevalent and was used by both critics of the Unification movement and movement members themselves. In 1982, a report sponsored in part by Auburn University noted: \\"In informal interviews with U.C. members have indicated that they do not consider the term 'Moonie' derogatory.\\" In the 1970s and early 1980s, the word \\"Moonie\\" was used by Unification movement members both within the movement and in public as a self-designation, and \\"as a badge of honor\\". Members could be seen on subways in New York wearing T-shirts that read: \\"I'm a Moonie and I love it\\". Religious scholar Anson Shupe notes that \\"on many occasions,\\" he heard \\"David Kim, President of the Unification Theological Seminary, refer to 'Moonie theology,' the 'Moonie lifestyle,' and so forth matter-of-factly\\". The principal aide to Moon, Bo Hi Pak, was quoted by Carlton Sherwood in his book Inquisition: The Persecution and Prosecution of the Reverend Sun Myung Moon as declaring to the United States Congress: \\"I am a proud Korean ‚Äì a proud 'Moonie' ‚Äì and a dedicated anti-Communist and I intend to remain so the rest of my life.\\" Moon himself declared: \\"In two and a half years the word 'Moonie' shall become an honorable name and we will have demonstrations and victory celebrations from coast to coast.\\" During the proceedings of United States v. Sun Myung Moon in 1982, federal prosecutors argued that the word \\"Moonie\\" be banned during the jury selection process because they said it was considered \\"a negative term,\\" and prejudicial in nature. Defense counsel for Moon instead asserted use of the word in the jury selection process was necessary to identify the Unification movement and to question jurors about possible prejudice. Judge Gerard L. Goettel denied the prosecution's request, and ruled that the word was appropriately \\"descriptive.\\" A 1992 study by Jeffrey E. Pfeifer of the University of Virginia on \\"The Psychological Framing of Cults\\" found that 75.51% (74 of 98) of participating individuals were familiar with the word \\"Moonies\\". Dr. Pfeifer sums up his findings by saying: :Subjects were asked to read a description of a young man who joins a group and is exposed to its indoctrination process. Depending on the condition, subjects were led to believe that the group was either the Moonies, the Marines, or the Catholic Church. Except for the group label, in all three conditions the description of the indoctrination process was identical. Subjects were then asked to evaluate both the group's indoctrination techniques and the individual who joined the group, and to complete a questionnaire regarding their general knowledge of cults. Results indicate that subject ratings are significantly affected by the group label and that general knowledge regarding cults is based primarily on indirect sources. In the 1995 book America's Alternative Religions, published by the State University of New York Press, Baker wrote: \\"Although they prefer to be called Unificationists, they are referred to in the media and popularly known as 'Moonies'.\\" In the same book, sociologists Anson Shupe and David Bromley, both noted for their studies of new religious movements, also use the word \\"Moonies\\" to refer to members of the Unification Church. In his 1998 book Religion, Mobilization, and Social Action, Shupe notes that Barker, Bromley, and he himself had used the term in other publications, \\"and meant no offense\\". In a 1996 article for The Independent about a talk former Prime Minister Edward Heath gave at a Unification movement-sponsored conference, Andrew Brown commented: \\"The term 'Moonie' has entered the language as meaning a brainwashed, bright-eyed zombie.\\" Brown also quoted William Shaw, a broadcaster who was presenting the Cult Fiction series on BBC Radio Five Live: \\"Most Moonies embrace a morality which would make them acceptable in the most genteel Anglican social circle.\\" In his 2000 book Mystics and Messiahs, Philip Jenkins likens the term to \\"smear words such as Shaker, Methodist, Mormon\\". Jenkins mentions use of the word in book titles including Life among the Moonies and Escape from the Moonies, and comments: \\"These titles further illustrate how the derogatory term 'Moonie' became a standard for members of this denomination, in a way that would have been inconceivable for any of the insulting epithets that could be applied to, say, Catholics or Jews.\\" In 2010, National Public Radio, in a story on \\"second generation\\" members, reported that they \\"bristle at the term 'Moonie'\\", while USA Today reported on \\"the folks who follow Rev. Sun Myung Moon (also known, to their dislike, as the Moonies).\\" Response by church members In 1984, The Washington Post noted, \\"Members of the Unification Church resent references to them as 'Moonies'\\", and quoted one church member who said, \\"Even in quotation marks, it's derogatory\\". In 1985, the president of the Unification Church of the United States, Mose Durst, said: \\"In one year, we moved from being a pariah to being part of the mainstream. People recognized that Reverend Moon was abused for his religious beliefs and they rallied around. You rarely hear the word 'Moonie' anymore. We're 'Unificationists.'\\" In 1987, civil rights activist Ralph Abernathy, who was also the vice president of the Unification Church- affiliated American Freedom Coalition and served on boards of directors for two other related organizations, equated the word \\"Moonie\\" with the word \\"nigger\\". In 1989, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that members preferred to be called \\"Unificationists.\\" The Washington Post reported that \\"Unification Church members are being advised no longer to accept the designation of 'Moonie,' and to declare any such nomenclature as indicative of a prejudiced view of the church.\\" In 1989, the Chicago Tribune was picketed after referring to members as Moonies. Moon directed minister and civil rights leader James Bevel to form a protest by religious officials against the Chicago Tribune because of the newspaper's use of the word. Bevel handed out fliers at the protest which said: \\"Are the Moonies our new niggers?\\" In 1990, a position paper sent from the Unification movement to The Fresno Bee said: \\"We will fight gratuitous use of the 'Moonie' or 'cult' pejoratives. We will call journalists on every instance of unprofessional reporting. We intend to stop distortions plagiarized from file clippings which propagate from story to story like a computer virus.\\" In 1992, Michael Jenkins (who later became president of the Unification Church of the United States) commented: \\"Why, after so many years, should we now be taking such a stand to eliminate the term 'Moonie?' For me, it is a sign that the American Unification Church has come of age. We can no longer allow our founder, our members, and allies to be dehumanized and unfairly discriminated against. ... We are now entering a period of our history where our Church development and family orientation are strong enough that we can turn our attention toward ending the widespread misunderstanding about our founder and the Unification movement.\\" In 1992, Unification movement member Kristopher Esplin told Reuters what is normally done if the word is seen in media sources: \\"If it's printed in newspapers, we will respond, write to the editor, that sort of thing.\\" On an October 6, 1994 broadcast of Nightline, host Ted Koppel stated: \\"On last night's program ...I used the term 'Moonies'. This is a label which members of the Reverend Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church find demeaning and offensive, and I'd like to apologize for its use.\\" In its entry on \\"Unification Church\\", the 2002 edition of The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage advised: \\"Unification Church is appropriate in all references to the Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity, which was founded by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon. Do not use the disparaging Moonie(s)\\". Reuters, in its handbook for journalists, says: \\"'Moonie' is a pejorative term for members of the Unification Church.

The king lists in the Book of Leinster have Tuathal succeed his cousin Lorc√°n mac Cellaig and Tuathal is given a reign of three years giving a reign of 851-854.Book of Leinster: Rig Laigin Byrne suggests that the root of this apparent confusion lay in the fact that the U√≠ D√∫nlainge kings exercised little real authority due to the aggressions of their western neighbour Cerball mac D√∫nlainge (died 888), King of Osraige. Cerball, while unable to install himself as king of Leinster, was able to prevent any rival king exercising real power there.Byrne, pg.163 In his death obit in the annals in 854 it states that he was wickedly killed by his own kinsmen.

His father was probably called Seleucus, his brother was called Ptolemy and he probably had a nephew called Seleucus. Antiochus married a Macedonian woman called Laodice and in about 358 BC Laodice bore Antiochus a son Seleucus I Nicator, who became a general of Alexander the Great and later founded and became the first king of the Seleucid Empire; she also bore him a daughter, Didymeia. It was pretended, in consequence of a dream which Laodice had, that the god Apollo was the real father of Seleucus. When Seleucus became king, he founded and named 16 cities in honor of his father, including the Syrian city of Antioch (now situated in modern Turkey) and the Seleucid Military Outpost, Antioch, Pisidia. Through Seleucus, Antiochus had thirteen Seleucid kings bearing his name, as well as various monarchs from the Kingdom of Commagene.

Carter was born in Rugby to a father who was an electrical engineer and the developer of the Carter coefficient, and a mother who was an active member of the Society of Friends. He was educated at Rugby School and St John's College, Cambridge, where he read Mathematics and Economics and attained a First. In World War II Carter refused to fight, being a conscientious objector, and because he refused to accept any conditions for his exemption he spent three months in Strangeways Prison, Manchester. When released, he joined the Friends' Relief Service, where he met Janet Shea, whom he married in 1944. In 1945, he returned to Cambridge, where he became a lecturer in statistics and, from 1947, a fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He remained at Cambridge until 1952, when he took the Chair of Applied Economics at Queen's University, Belfast. Whilst in Northern Ireland he became a student of The Troubles, and concluded that a Protestant monopoly on power was unacceptable and could not be sustained. He also chaired the Northern Ireland Economic Development Council. In 1959 he moved to the Stanley Jevons chair in Manchester, remaining there for four years. As an economist, he was a follower of G.L.S. Shackle, and was concerned about the impact of expectations in human decisions. In 1963, he became the founding Vice- Chancellor of the new University of Lancaster. He managed to admit the first 264 students in 1964, a year ahead of schedule, by utilising disused buildings as temporary accommodation and teaching facilities. Carter's vision was for Lancaster to be a university for the whole North West, commenting that the people of Lancashire thought of it as their university. He refused \\"discrimination on the grounds of race, colour, politics or any other thing\\" and established links with various Higher Education Colleges, thus pre-empting the drive for widening participation forty years later. His tenure at the University of Lancaster ended in 1979, the same year he was knighted. He retired to Seascale, Cumbria, and continued to work on projects he deemed to be worthwhile.

FrameStore-CFC. The commercial was created by Chas Bayfield and Jim Bolton at the UK advertising agency, HHCL + Partners and was directed by Colin Gregg at the production company Eclipse for the client David Atter at Britvic. The advertisement was Tango's biggest advertisement to date, and with most of its budget being spent on production as opposed to airtime, the advert only appeared on national television ten times, mostly in advert breaks during the Channel 4 series TFI Friday. This unusual scheduling idea was deemed groundbreaking. The advert won several major advertising awards in 1997, notably a Cannes Gold Lion and a Silver Pencil from D&AD; in London. It has been voted one of the 100 best commercials of all time and was popular for its latent jingoism and the fact that it appears to have been filmed in one continuous shot. The advert also saw the re-release of \\"Don't You Want Me\\" by Felix, which features in the advert, as a CD and cassette release, which also featured the Tango Blackcurrant logo. It reached number 17 in the UK Singles Chart. Sequence St George opens with Tango spokesman Ray Gardner in his office in the headquarters of Tango. He appears to be doing a corporate video. He has a letter in his hand from a French exchange student, Sebastien Loyes, who is critical of new blackcurrant flavoured Tango. Ray addresses Sebastien's criticism in what begins as a mutual retort before slowly developing into a full-on rant. Ray walks forward, bumping into the camera before continuing his rant through the office. He is joined by some colleagues who follow him out into the car park where, now in full flow, he begins stripping off. Ray is joined by more staff who help him off with the rest of his clothes, revealing some bright purple boxing shorts under his trousers. Ray and his entourage arrive seamlessly on the White Cliffs of Dover where a flag waving army of supporters have gathered to cheer on their leader. The commercial is now fully widescreen and the action is accompanied by rousing anthemic dance music - \\"Don't You Want Me\\" by Felix. As they help him into some purple boxing gloves and place a purple cloak around his shoulders, Ray continues his rant against Sebastien. On the edge of the cliffs is a boxing ring which Ray climbs into, before challenging Sebastian, France, Europe and the world to a fight. In the sky behind him, three Harrier Jump Jets appear and tilt menacingly. Production Background and conception Since 1992, London-based advertising agency HHCL + Partners had created each advertisement for the different variants and flavours of Tango, owned by Britvic, beginning with the Orange Man advertisement for the orange flavour. Several of the agency's advertisements for the brand had proven controversial, but by 1994, the brand's ongoing \\"You Know When You've Been Tango'd\\" campaign had helped Tango double its share on the soft drinks market. The campaign had finished in 1995 when Tango focused on individual advertising for its different flavours. Each flavour was now being advertised with its own campaigns and distinct identities; advertisements for the Orange flavour were largely put on hold whilst Tango Apple advertisements involved imbibers' bizarre sexual fetishes for the product, Tango Lemon advertisements featured the product as the euphoric, ritualistic drink of a fictional cult worshipping their god, Jim, whilst advertisements for the \\"Still Tango\\" variant warned viewers that the variant was unofficial and that viewers should call a number given on screen, only for callers to be greeted with the news that it was a trick. When Tango Blackcurrant launched as the fourth official flavour of Tango in 1995‚Äì96, an advertisement for the flavour entitled Trade was created in which Britvic's National Sales Manager Nigel Harrison announces several promotional tie-ins, but which are then denounced by his colleague Sunhil Patel because \\"this stuff with sell itself anyway.\\" Nonetheless it is disputed whether the advertisement was ever aired, and in early 1996, Tango began planning for their re-launch in July 1996 with a new logo; the planning included \\"re-launching\\" Tango Blackcurrant with a brand new advertisement, introducing not just the flavour's new logo but indeed widening knowledge of the flavour itself; the plan effectively rendered Trade a standalone advertisement. Continuing their focus on instigating advertisements for flavours of Tango other than Orange, David Atter of Britvic re-hired HHLC + Partners to create the new Tango Blackcurrant advertisement. The original plan was to create a commercial that was only 30 seconds long and was intended to be an attack on Coca-Cola, who had dominated the soft drinks market. The advertisement soon evolved into the radically different St George, which they planned as a 90-second advertisement‚Äìthe longest Tango advertisement so far‚Äìwhich would not attack Coca-Cola but instead present the drink as very \\"British\\" and present another confrontational style of advertising the product. The decision to make the advertisement longer came from both Tango's desire to surprise its customers and because the only soft drink brand that could afford to do such a long commercial was Coca-Cola. Using a majority of the advertisement's budget on the production (rather than airtime) and only airing it 10 times was a risk that Tango believed was worth taking. HHCL hired television actor Ray Gardner to play a fictionalized version of himself in the advertisement, having worked with him previously when he played the character of Marshall in a 1995 HHCL- created advertisement for the Automobile Association. Production St George was written by Chas Bayfield and Jim Bolton, directed by television drama director Colin Gregg and produced by production company Eclipse on a total campaign budget of ¬£400,000, which remains the largest budget for a Tango advertisement to date. Nonetheless, The Independent reported the budget to be ¬£500,000. The commercial was filmed over only three days in April 1996. The office section was shot in a new high rise development overlooking East Croydon railway station, the car park was in a business park in Welwyn Garden City and the White Cliffs filmed at St Margaret's at Cliffe, Kent. Gregg explained that the White Cliffs were chosen as a filming location because \\"what more British location can you have than the White Cliffs of Dover?\\" Ray's office and the White Cliffs were filmed first and the car park sequence was shot to link the two together. Ringcraft Boxing Ring Hire Specialists built the boxing ring used in the advertisement. The flag-wielding extras in Gardner's entourage recorded their chants separately on the same day in the same field. During production of St George, Barth Hulley, who produced the advertisement, also duly shot and directed The Making of Blackcurrant Tango, a fifteen-minute \\"making-of\\" video. Hulley's brief stated that the making-of video was required in order to be supplied to his client. The style of St George gradually changes from an amateurish corporate video-style piece into an epic, cinematic widescreen piece whilst Gardner is running towards the White Cliffs with his growing entourage. There are several tricks in St George to give the illusion that it was filmed in one take; Gardner moves from a 20th storey office to the ground floor, then to the office car park and the White Cliffs, all apparently in one take. In fact, Gardner passes a white wall on leaving his office and his position is matched exactly against a white wall on the ground floor. Similarly, Gardner‚Äôs position as he passes a Tango truck in the car park had to be replicated exactly to match his actions as he passes the truck on the White Cliffs. The usage of music in the advertisement‚Äìan unfinished remix of Felix's \\"Don't You Want Me\\"‚Äìmarked the first time since 1991, and the first time since HHCL began creating Tango advertisements, that a Tango commercial featured a musical soundtrack.St George was also the first Tango advertisement to use commercially available music since a 1988 commercial featuring \\"Apache\\" by The Shadows. Framestore CFC (offices pictured) provided computer generated effects. There were several problems during production; Gardner needed to step out of his trousers as he leaves the building, something which needed nearly thirty takes to get right, and Gregg cancelled his idea for Gardner to start running after taking a sip of Tango Blackcurrant because it implies the drink has given him energy. Production was not helped by how the fact that on the first two days of filming, the weather was fine but on the third, it snowed. Due to health and safety regulations, the crew were not allowed to use real Harrier jets on the day‚Äìthe planes were computer generated afterwards by the digital visual effects company, Framestore CFC. Unlike many television advertisements, St George does not feature a slogan, nor indeed is the Tango logo ever superimposed on the screen in its final moments; however, St George is not free of Tango branding: The Tango offices depicted in St George suitingly features numerous staff members from Britvic, as well as several Tango branded items, such as the \\"Tango doll\\"‚Äìtaken from a 1995 campaign, a Tango Blackcurrant vending machine, a Still Tango poster and a Tango door sticker, whilst outside the offices is a Tango sign Tango Blackcurrant delivery lorry, and later on in the advertisement, Gardner's entourage Tango Blackcurrant flags whilst Gardner himself wears a Tango-branded boxing shorts and cape, whose Tango logo was stitched on the day of filming. At the time the use of the Harrier Jump Jets at the end of the advert made it one of the most expensive adverts ever made. Broadcast St George premi√®red on British television on 1 October 1996. As the majority of the advertisement's budget was put into production instead of airtime, St George only ever aired on television ten times, mostly during advert breaks during the Channel 4 series TFI Friday; one commentary later clarified that St George aired once a week for six weeks during TFI Friday. Public relations firm Freud Communications worked with Britvic in publicising St George by making \\"a celebrity\\" out of the otherwise unknown Ray Gardner, arranging for him to be interviewed on television and in the newspapers. David Atter, international marketing manager for Tango, explained to PR Week that \\"as a youth product, Blackcurrant Tango was particularly adaptable and flexible. We didn‚Äôt need to have a well-known celebrity to reach our audience.\\" Scheduling the commercial in advert breaks of TFI Friday alone was considered unusual, even revolutionary, at the time.The Channel 4 TV Planning Awards 2006: The planner's planner The idea came from George Michaelides of Michaelides & Bednash. Vizeum UK's joint managing director, Matt Andrews, considered Michaelides to be a worthy candidate for a legacy prize at the 2006 Channel 4 TV Planning Awards, citing his scheduling idea for the advertisement as a reason. Andrews explained: An unreleased and unfinished remix of hardbag musician Felix's 1992 song \\"Don't You Want Me\\" features in St George; by the time of the broadcast of the advertisement, the remix had been updated to become the \\"'96 Pugilist Mix\\", featuring samples of Ray Gardner's dialogue from the advertisement. This version was released as a single on 4 October 1996 by Deconstruction Records on CD, cassette and purple-coloured seven-inch vinyl to coincide with the Tango Blackcurrant and St George launch. The single features the Tango Blackcurrant logo several times in its packaging, and reached number 17 on the UK Singles Chart in October 1996. In the remix's music video, the St George samples were modified to remove mentions of Tango Blackcurrant, but the original version later featured on the hits compilation Hits 97. On 13 October, the campaign continued when customers who bought the Sunday Mail at branches of Esso Snack & Shop were each given a free can of Tango Blackcurrant. Reception St George was an instant critical and commercial success. Peter York of The Independent stated that \\"the launch of Blackcurrant Tango provides the opportunity for a fizzy drink to make a unique political statement - indeed an intervention. The European Movement will no doubt object strenuously.\\" He noted the advertisement's diversion from the norm, saying \\"Roy displays a patriotic body of a kind never normally seen in TV commercials: white, with a proudly cantilevered beer-belly and two pendulous crescent breastettes. British as they come, the Roy Gardner body speaks for pork pies, British lager, and full-cream dairy products. It defies gymnasia and sunbathing.\\" He called it \\"a simply brilliant launch\\". In 1997, the Institute of Contemporary Arts included it in their Assuming Positions exhibition. The exhibit examined how art could be created from a number of unexpected sources.ICA July 1997 Kate Bush, curator of the exhibition, said St George was used because it was \\"technically brilliant as well as self- knowing\\": \\"It starts off dull and builds to a wonderful cinematic climax. You could read it as real laddishness and repugnant xenophobia, but at the same time you known it knows all that about itself and is a parody. This helps it transcend being an advert and becomes art.\\" Mike Cozens, creative director of Young & Rubicam, praised the advertisement and said \\"it's been a great hit with punters as well as with advertising juries, which doesn't always follow. It's good to see such a mainstream brand like this winning awards for its advertising; it's often more obscure brands that win, which is sometimes questionable.\\" Impressed with Gardner's performance in St George, the advertisement's producer Barth Hulley asked him to star in his short film Up and Running. Despite St Georges popularity in the public eye, it was also nonetheless controversial; it was also one of the top 10 most complained about adverts reported to the Independent Television Commission (ITC) in 1996, as 68 complainants citied it as 'insulting and xenophobic'. The ITC dismissed the complaints, characterising the humour as harmless and likening it to what viewers might see on Fawlty Towers. Letters of complaint from French exchange students who did not see the humour in the advertisement were ridiculed in newspaper inserts. Accolades St George was a major success in the industry and won a string of awards. A year after its premiere, Paul McCann of The Independent said that St George \\"has won nearly every advertising award in Britain.\\" In March 1997, St George won HHCL Partners the British Creative Circle award for best advertisement of the year. The commercial, which was honoured in the platinum section, also won the gold award for best use of humour, as did its sister advert for Tango Apple. In May, St George won the D&AD; \\"Silver Pencil\\" design award for best advert of the year, in June, St George won a Cannes \\"Gold Lion\\" award for being a top-tier advertisement, and in November 1997, St George was selected as the grand prize winner from among 7,000 entries from 78 countries at the London International Advertising Awards. It has also been listed on many industry \\"advert of the year\\" lists, and won the \\"ITV gold award\\" at the British Television Advertising Awards. In later times, St George continued to receive acclaim. In as early as May 1997, St George was named \\"ad of the decade\\" in a survey of readers of Sky Magazine, beating Levi's 1995 Planet advertisement. It has been voted one of the 100 best commercials of all time. Bernice Kanner included St George in his 1999 list book 100 Best TV Commercials: And Why They Worked. It won the Film Four \\"Best Long Commercial 1956-2001\\" award in June 2007, whilst Gardner was honoured with the Channel 4 \\"Director's Cut\\" Gold Award that same summer, where the advertisement was awarded top honours in the \\"Vintage Category\\". Ray Gardner later won the \\"ITV Best Actor In A Commercial\\" Award for his performance. In 2008, advertising industry publication Campaign Live ranked St George at number 2 in their list of the \\"Top 10 Funniest TV Ads of All Time\\". In 2013, Ben Tollett and Emer Stamp, joint creative directors of Adam & Eve DDB, included the advert in his list of \\"3 Great Ads I Had Nothing to Do With\\", part of a series for Campaign Live. At the turn of the millennium, the original Hooj-produced \\"Hooj Mix\\" version of \\"Don't You Want Me\\", which features in St George in an early variation of its specially created \\"'96 Pugilist Mix\\", was included on several commercially successful, TV-advertised British various artists compilation albums of popular music featured in acclaimed television advertisements, including Virgin Records' The Best TV Ads...Ever! (2000), which was part of The Best...Album in the World...Ever! compilation strand, and Telstar Records's Switched On: The Cool Sound of TV Advertising (2001). The compilations were both released on CD, with The Best TV Ads...Ever! also being released on cassette, and reached number 10 and 9 in the UK Compilation Chart respectively. Aftermath Ray Gardner later appeared in a FIFA World Cup 1998-tie-in Tango commercial. Tango themselves parodied St George in a HHCL-created advertisement for the orange flavour entitled Vote Orange Tango. The advertisement, broadcast in March 1997 in the run up to the General Election, takes the form of a mock party political broadcast where a Tango Orange campaigner criticizes the Apple, Lemon and Blackcurrant variants of the drink individually; his remarks against the blackcurrant flavour see him walk to the roof of a building where the character of Ray Gardner (portrayed by an actor other than Gardner) is still shown expressing his anger against Sebastian, but is clearly exhausted, and ultimately falls into a puddle. The spokesperson criticizes \\"Blackcurrant Tango\\" as \\"stinky wind\\" and \\"lets off\\" an inflatable Ray Gardner. The advertisement was broadcast in the first ever advert break on Channel 5. Despite his ties to the blackcurrant flavour, Gardner himself later appeared in two advertisements for the orange flavour. The first of these advertisements, Clowns, aired between late 1997 and early 1998 and showed him encouraging a colleague at an event where clowns were being run over by giant trucks. The advertisement was released to promote the send-away Tango Horn toy, but Tango themselves appeared to deem the advert a failure when a further advertisement in early 1998 humorously dismissed the advert as such. Gardner's second Tango Orange advertisement aired in mid-1998 during the 1998 FIFA World Cup and showed Gardner advertising a competition to win television sets as part of the brand's World Cup promotions. He sported the same uniform as in the start of St George. Additionally, Gardner appeared in several wraparound stings (break bumpers) during ITV's coverage of the World Cup where he is shown exploring Paris between games, although these stings do not feature Tango branding. Despite the success of St George, there were no further advertisements for Tango Blackcurrant, and the flavour was discontinued after several years. Post-St George Tango advertising prior to 2000 focused mainly on the Tango brand as a whole or on the orange and diet orange flavours, and the blackcurrant variant was dropped before their more eclectic advertising would return in the millennium. Tango Blackcurrant was relaunched as an Asda- exclusive flavour in August 2011 and as a standard flavour in December 2012. Nonetheless, St George remains the final advertisement for the drink, with Tango having seldom advertised on television in the 2010s.

Background Imad ud-din Lahiz was among the fourth generation of Islamic scholars in the family. His father, Mohammed Siraj ud-din, grandfather and great-grandfather had all been maulvis. The Lahiz family hailed from Panipat, a town situated in the modern day Haryana state of India. The Muslims of Panipat had a reputation for being zealous the faith of Islam and were well-versed in Islamic jurisprudence. Imad ud-Din Lahiz was a prolific writer. He translated the Quran into Urdu and also composed several Bible commentaries. In addition to Lahiz‚Äôs writings about Islam, its history, faith and practices, his translation of the Quran into Urdu and his many Bible commentaries, he wrote many rebuttals to the works of Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan and Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, the founder of the Ahmadiyyah movement in Islam. He assisted Rahmatullah Kairanawi alongside Muhammad Waz√Ær Kh√¢n represent the Muslim side in a widely publicised Muslim-Christian debate featuring German Christian Karl Gottlieb Pfander in Agra, 1854.Bennett, C.; The Legacy of Carl Gottlieb Pfander, International Bulletin of Missionary Research, http://www.internationalbulletin.org/issues/1996-02/1996-02-076-bennett.pdf The interest the debate aroused led a number of Muslims to read Pfander's literature and consider the questions that had been discussed. Some, such as Imad ud-Din Lahiz himself and Sufi Maulvi Safdar Ali who was also in attendance and a close friend, subsequently converted to Christianity. Imad ud-din Lahiz was so impressed with Pfander's arguments in his work Mizan Al Haqq (The Balance of Truth) that he noted upon his conversion to Christianity: > \\"We can now, I think, say that the controversy has virtually been complete > ... [that] the Christians have obtained a complete victory, while our > opponents have been signally defeated.\\"Imad-ud-Din, \\"The Results of the > Controversy in North India with Mohammedans,\\" Church Missionary > Intelligencer (hereafter CMI) 10 (1875): 276 Conversion Lahiz converted to Christianity at Amritsar on 29 April 1866 together with his aged father and brother.

But many people, among them my elders, friends, acquaintances and others, have expressed various ideas of their own about me. There are those who say that Imad ud-Din is merely a fictitious person, a doubt shared by some persons in Peshawar. Others say that I became a Christian for worldly gain. Some orthodox Muslims cannot believe that I have really become a Christian, an opinion expressed by people in Qaroli and elsewhere. Thus, I have deemed it necessary to relate my full story in such a way that all who know me may know that the subject of this account is truly I.\\" Works Imad-ud Din Lahiz wrote his autobiography in 1866.

I wasn't in cahoots with anybody to bring about his downfall.\\" On the Cold War front, Mrs. Reagan takes credit for assembling a meeting in Geneva between her husband and Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev. Her husband One of the most discussed matters in the book is her husband, and how much influence she exerted over him while in office. In the book, she explains that she found it proper and just to talk to the president and advise him on anything. She admits that she consulted an astrologer, Joan Quigley, but says it only started after the 1981 attempt on President Reagan's life. She acknowledges that she altered the President's schedule without his knowledge based on astrological advice, but argues that \\"no political decision was ever based [on astrology]\\". She also writes about how after the shooting, she became very fretful and worried about her husband every time he left the White House. She wrote, \\"I'm a worrier, and now I really had something to worry about: that it might happen again, and that this time, I would lose him forever. Astrology was simply one of the ways I coped with the fear I felt after my husband almost died.\\"Reagan, Nancy (1989), p. 44 Her children Perhaps the most recorded problem of Mrs. Reagan's was that of her children and stepchildren, Maureen, Michael, Patti, and Ron. The most-publicized controversy erupted between Nancy and her daughter Patti. Mrs. Reagan wrote of it, \\"there is still time for us to improve our relationship, and now that our public years are over, I'm hoping Patti and I will be able to reach some kind of understanding.\\" This was written in 1989 and Mrs. Reagan and her daughter have since reconciled. However, in the book, she faults her for not attending her grandmother's funeral, and for being a difficult child. Regarding Michael, Mrs. Reagan speaks of a controversy between them. In 1984, the first lady said on television that she and Michael were in an \\"estrangement right now\\". Michael responded that Nancy was trying to cover up for the fact she had not met his daughter, Ashley, who had been born nearly a year earlier.Reagan, Nancy (1989), pp. 148‚Äì149 They have also made peace. Reagan was thought to be closest to her stepdaughter, Maureen, during her White House years.

To be admitted to the school, a child had to have a perfect pitch and go through a series of rigorous evaluations aimed at measuring her or his innate musical gift. Fate willed that the fame of Pyotr Stolyarsky, a master violin pedagogue, should reach far beyond Odessa, the city in general, and the entire country. At the start of his career, Stolyarsky offered private violin lessons in his studio, which later became the Stolyarsky Specialized Music School of Odessa. Among his star pupils were David Oistrakh, Nathan Milstein, Iosif Brodsky, Samuil Furer, Boris Goldstein, Elizabeth Gilels (sister of pianist Emil Gilels and wife of the Soviet violinist Leonid Kogan), Igor Oistrakh, Mikhail Fikhtengoltz and Eduard Grach who was one of his last pupils. Russian composer Oscar Feltsman also studied in this school. In the Soviet Union Stolyarsky's name was always associated with the special pedagogic method for professional instruction(s) in music for gifted children (from an early age). Stoliarsky had superb personal qualities of a master teacher, highest musical instincts and organizational talent which made it possible for him to attain maximum results. Stoliarsky is one of the founders of the Soviet violin school. His students won top prizes among important competitions. In 1935 Wieniawski Competition in Warsaw; Ginette Neveu from France came first, David Oistrakh second, Henry Temianka won third, Boris Goldstein came in fourth and Josef Hassid from Poland received an honorary diploma. In 1937, at one of the most prestigious international competitions of its time, the International Ysaye Competition, Stoliarsky students caused a sensation. Top prizes were garnered by David Oistrakh, Boris Goldshtein (Goldstein), Yelizaveta Gilels and Mikhail Fikhtengoltz. The Soviet Politburo was indeed riding the propaganda machine to its fullest. The foundations of musical education laid down by Stolyarsky are to this day zealously guarded by his disciples and followers. In the 1950-1970s, after the professor's death, the Stolyarsky school gave a start in life to a new generation of brilliant musicians, among them Margarita Lekhter, Rudolf Lekhter, Mark Zinger, Zakhar Bron, Boris Bloch, Mikhail Vaiman (Novy Bug, 3 December 1926 ‚Äì Leningrad, 28 November 1977), Evgeny Mogilevsky, Dora Schwarzberg, Pavel Vernikov, Karmella Tsepkolenko, Alexander Vinitsky, Arkady Shindelman, Alexander & Mark Peskanov and Gennady Filimonov. The school continues to operate today. Music is still heard today in the Stolyarsky School, where the child prodigies of today are trained to be the virtuosi of tomorrow.

A Soviet Intelligence officer, he is the head of Moscow Centre, le Carr√©'s fictional version of the KGB, and the nemesis of le Carr√©'s frequent protagonist George Smiley. Karla is nominally an unseen character who operates either through functionaries, hitmen, or by turning his enemies into double agents. Although other characters recount their past meetings with him, he only appears once during the events of the books. His real name is never revealed; instead, he takes his code name from that of the first spy network that he recruited. Karla is the central antagonist in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, The Honourable Schoolboy, and Smiley's People, three novels which were later published as a single omnibus edition entitled Smiley Versus Karla or The Quest for Karla in the US. In the BBC's television adaptations of both Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and Smiley's People, Karla is played by British actor Patrick Stewart. Karla is only seen briefly in one scene in each production and does not speak. Fictional biography Much of Karla's history is unconfirmed rumour, passed by Smiley to his prot√©g√© Peter Guillam. Among the rumours are: that his father was a professional intelligence officer, first for the Czarist Okhrana and later for the Bolshevist Cheka; that as a boy Karla worked as a kitchen boy on a train in occupied Siberia during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905 (putting his birth somewhere in the late 19th century); and that he was trained in espionage by \\"Berg\\" (a possible reference to an alias used by Alexander Mikhailovich Orlov), which Smiley compares to \\"being taught music by a great composer.\\" The first recorded Karla activities came during the Spanish Civil War, when he entered Nationalist territory in Spain posing as a White Russian journalist (i.e., an anti-Communist Russian), and recruited a large number of German agents. The network was code-named \\"Karla\\", and the agent was later known only by that name. It was an outstanding achievement for such a young man and would become characteristic of Karla in the series. He next appeared during the German invasion of Russia, running networks of partisans behind German lines. He discovered that his radio operator was a double agent for the Germans and so fed him false information that confused the Germans. According to one legend, at \\"Yelnya\\", Karla caused the Germans to shell their own forward line (presumably a reference to either the Yelnya Offensive during the first Battle of Smolensk, or the second Battle of Smolensk). During his years as a field agent, Karla traveled in several countries, recruiting agents who would later become highly placed in their respective national regimes. He traveled to England in 1936 and 1941 and recruited Bill Haydon, code-named \\"Gerald\\", who eventually became the number-two-man in the \\"Circus\\" (the British Secret Intelligence Service). At another time he recruited Nelson Ko, a high-ranking technocrat in the People's Republic of China (according to Connie Sachs, Karla was one of the few Soviets to predict the souring of Sino- Soviet relations). In 1948, Karla was snagged in one of Stalin's random purges of the Soviet military and intelligence organisations and sent to prison in Siberia. His wife, a student from Leningrad, killed herself. However, Karla served his time and returned to intelligence work; the experience did nothing to dull his devotion to the Communist cause. In 1951, while setting up a network in California under the name \\"Gerstmann,\\" Karla was unexpectedly caught when his radio codes were broken. Though he escaped the United States, he was arrested in Delhi on his way back to Moscow. Smiley attempted to use reason to get Karla to defect to the United Kingdom. Smiley felt that his case was ironclad: Karla's superiors at Moscow Centre were clearly looking to make him the scapegoat for the failure in California, and he was facing certain execution. Rather than giving in, Karla instead studied Smiley's words for signs of a hidden weakness, correctly deducing Smiley's insecurity regarding his unfaithful wife, Ann. Ultimately, Karla agreed to return to the Soviet Union, stealing Smiley's lighter prior to departure. He returned to Moscow and somehow contrived to have his superiors dismissed and executed, with himself appointed in their place. After being promoted away from active fieldwork, Karla sought to create his own independent apparatus inside Moscow Centre, believing that his personal agents were too important to leave to others. After several years, he finally became senior enough to create this apparatus (named in Smiley's People as the Thirteenth Directorate). He founded a special camp outside Moscow (towards Kiev) and trained a selection of handpicked men (usually ex-military officers) to act as handlers of his various moles. Role in the novels Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy Karla is first mentioned in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy as the spymaster who recruited and controls \\"Gerald\\", a mole inside the Circus. By the time of the novel, the mole‚ÄîBill Haydon‚Äîhas become The Circus' number-two-man; Karla uses his handler, Alexei Polyakov, to deliver fabricated intelligence that appears highly valuable. This allows the Circus (and, thus Karla) to gain access to highly valuable intelligence from the American CIA and also creates a perfect cover for Gerald's activities: Polyakov must pretend to his superiors that he is running a mole inside the Circus to meet with the Circus officials, so the Circus itself ignores and suppresses any indications that there is a mole, not realising that there really is. Smiley recounts what little he knows of Karla's history to his protege, Peter Guillam, including his interview with Karla in Delhi, and opines that Karla is a \\"fanatic\\", which he hopes will one day cause his downfall. After Jim Prideaux is freed from capture by the Soviets, Smiley interrogates him, learning that Karla came to visit Prideaux in prison and showed him that he still had Smiley's lighter. After Smiley reveals that Haydon is the mole, Haydon reveals that Karla has directed all of his activities, including encouraging Haydon to cuckold Smiley. He tells him that Karla regarded Smiley as the person most likely to uncover Haydon and that the affair was calculated to cloud Smiley's judgement and cast any accusations he may make as the vengeance of a wronged husband. As Smiley drives to break the news to his cheating spouse, he reflects that Haydon's self-justifying \\"confession\\" was an inadequate explanation for becoming a traitor in the first place, and only Karla discerned the quality in Haydon that allowed him to be turned. In Smiley's words, only Karla saw \\"the last little doll inside Bill Haydon.\\" The Honourable Schoolboy In the aftermath of Haydon's exposure, Karla moves ruthlessly to arrest and execute those Circus agents behind the Iron Curtain that Haydon betrayed. Smiley, appointed temporary chief of the Circus, scrambles to contain the disaster and save who can be saved, but with only minimal success. Karla's aggressive targeting of operatives all over the world necessitates the Circus to shut down safe houses and recall spies even in non-Soviet countries, including one in Vietnam. However, Smiley quickly takes the offensive. On the theory that Haydon's activities for the Circus were entirely directed by Karla, Smiley reasons that Haydon's record can lead them to other possible moles of Karla in other countries, who can yield valuable intelligence to restore the Circus's prestige. He is proven right, as evidence of Haydon's refusal to investigate a possible money laundering operation in Laos leads them to unmask Nelson Ko, Karla's mole inside the People's Republic of China. Karla does not appear to have a direct hand in protecting his mole. Instead, the Circus's main opponent is Nelson's brother Drake, a powerful Hong Kong crime lord. Although the Circus fails to capture Nelson themselves, their joint cooperation with the CIA leads to the Americans seizing him as he attempts to escape from Hong Kong back onto mainland China. During his tenure as Chief, Smiley keeps a photograph of Karla on his wall, seemingly as an object of obsession. It is an uncharacteristically symbolic and personal gesture for Smiley that unsettles his subordinates. Over the course of the novel, Ann takes to calling Karla \\"Smiley's Black Grail,\\" which becomes a recurring phrase. Smiley's People In Smiley's People, it is revealed that Karla had a young daughter, Tatiana, by a mistress during the Great Patriotic War. His mistress was Estonian, and in his daughter's incoherent memory, Karla had her mother killed after he overheard her praying (contrary to Communism's atheist views). Eventually, Tatiana began to demonstrate symptoms of schizophrenia. Unable to get her proper treatment, Karla uses a set of amateur agents to find or create a false identity that would allow him to send her to Western Europe to an adequate mental health clinic. As new Circus Chief Saul Enderby comments, Karla had to use amateurs because he had trained his own agents to be both too smart and too fanatically devoted to his ideals to be trusted with his private scheme. Because these agents are amateurs, they make several mistakes that allow Smiley to pick up on Karla's scheme. In desperation, Karla orders several assassinations, which only galvanises Smiley's investigation. Finally, Smiley gathers damning proof of Karla's activities that will ensure his destruction by his rivals at Moscow Centre, and offers Karla a choice: defect or be destroyed. Knowing that his fall will also be Tatiana's, Karla agrees to defect. In his only personal appearance in the novels, Karla crosses into West Berlin disguised as a laborer and is taken into custody by Circus officers. As he leaves, he drops Ann's cigarette lighter on the ground, but Smiley feels no urge to pick it up. Watching Karla be taken away, Smiley contemplates that he has won at last, but by a cruel irony, he and Karla have switched roles: Smiley has become the ruthless exploiter of Karla's vulnerability, while Karla has been defeated not through his fanaticism, but his love for his daughter. Other Karla does not appear again in le Carr√©'s novels, except a brief mention in The Secret Pilgrim, when Smiley tells a group of probationary intelligence officers that he was the one who debriefed Karla in captivity. Speaking in general about the nature of interrogations, Smiley says that sometimes they are \\"communions between damaged souls.\\" The date of Smiley's first encounter with Karla, in the jail in New Delhi, is unclear. In Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, we are told that the interrogation took place in the fifties. But in Smiley's People, Smiley recalls the meeting as having occurred in the sixties. Karla's ultimate fate is revealed in 2017's A Legacy of Spies, in which Jim Prideaux recounts to Guillam that, following his debriefing, Smiley arranged for Karla to teach Russian at a university in Latin America. Roughly a year later, Karla committed suicide; according to Prideaux, Smiley became grief stricken at his death, a response he doesn't understand given the nature of their relationship. Appearance and identity Karla is described as a small, spare man in middle age with an extraordinary composure and ascetic habits. Smiley describes him as modest and avuncular, Mediterranean in look and that he resembled a priest or schoolmaster. His most identifiable characteristic is his habit of chain smoking Camels. Real-life influences Several real-life intelligence figures have been postulated as models for Karla, including KGB General Rem Krassilnikov, whose obituary in the New York Times stated that his CIA opponents viewed him as a real-life Karla.  Film and television adaptations  Karla appears briefly in the BBC adaptations of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and Smiley's People, though he does not speak in either. He is played by Patrick Stewart. Karla appears briefly in the 2011 film adaptation of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy as a voice, provided by Michael Sarne, as well as in a partial shot in a Budapest coffee shop holding Smiley's lighter.

Culver built the mill around 1830 and the house 20 years later. The latter is an excellent example of the Picturesque aesthetic as applied to an Italianate house. Both buildings were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. Buildings The house and mill are the only buildings on the lot. A concrete slab bridge between them is not considered a contributing resource since it is relatively new compared to the house and mill. The house House The house is located on the slope across the creek from the road, and thus in the Town of Goshen. It is a two-story, three-by- four-bay frame house on a rubblestone foundation, with a low hipped roof. It appears to be three stories from the road because the basement is exposed on the south and east sides. A porch wraps around three sides, save the north. The clapboard siding is original. The roofline is distinguished by a finely- molded cornice with brackets and wide eaves. The corners are trimmed with broad pilasters. Smaller pilasters and a cornice surround the entrance, where a wide door is divided into four arched Gothic panels. Inside, the two parlors on either side of the main hall have marble fireplaces, plaster cornices, wooden architraves and wide plank flooring. Ornamentation continues in the upstairs bedrooms with wood molding in a lyre motif and other intricately detailed woodwork. Mill The mill is located to the southeast of the house, closer to the highway on the Florida side of the creek. It is a four- story, six-by-four bay frame building in a local rural vernacular style on a stone foundation. It has red wood clapboard siding and a gabled roof. The remnants of a chimney on the north side, facing the creek, are still visible. The original plank flooring and some of the machinery are still inside. History The Randel family had been milling on the property since at least 1790. Records show that many local commodities were milled at the site: wood, wool and flour, as well as millwork for home furniture. Culver Randel took over the property around the middle of the 19th century. He had spent some time apprenticing with a piano manufacturer in New York City as a younger man, and decided to give that business a try in his hometown. The mill produced pianos through his retirement in 1870. The new house he built for his own family reflected the tastes of the time found in pattern books by Andrew Jackson Downing and Calvert Vaux. Their designs were for country houses that would harmonize with nature. Randel's is considered an outstanding example of the contemporary Picturesque movement to a popular style of the day. There have been very few additions or alterations to either property. East and west additions to the mill were removed in the mid-20th century, and both it and the house were extensively restored in the 1990s prior to its nomination for the NRHP.

The length of a train, including the longest trains, may be measured in number of wagons (for bulk loads such as coal and iron ore) or in metres for general freight. Train lengths and loads on electrified railways, especially lower voltage 3000 V DC and 1500 V DC, are limited by traction power considerations. Drawgear and couplings can be a limiting factor, tied in with curves, gradients and crossing loop lengths. Conventional freight trains in India can average nearly 2.8 km (2800 m). Freight trains with a total length of three or four times that average are possible with the advent of distributed power, or additional locomotive units between or behind long chains of freight cars (referred to as a \\"consist\\"). Additional locomotive units enable much longer, heavier loads without the increased risks of derailing that stem from the stress of pulling very long chains of train-cars around curves.

It referenced the contemporary debate between creationism and evolution, as well as supernatural themes, overlaid with elements of science fiction. The book was an immediate success, well beyond expectations. Synopsis A Romance of Two Worlds starts with a young heroine, in first person, telling her story of a debilitating illness that includes depression and thoughts of suicide. Her doctor is unable to help her and sends her off on a holiday where she meets a mystical character by the name of Raffello Cellini, a famous Italian artist. Cellini offers her a strange potion which immediately puts her into a tranquil slumber, in which she experiences divine visions. Upon wakening, she craves more. Later, she meets her unnamed guardian angel, who whisks her through infinite solar systems faster than a shooting star while human spirits fly by like gossamer silk. He shares the truth of religion and the secret of human destiny, but still she longs for more. She comes to understand God as pure light and pure love, but it is not enough that she should see and hear these things from the touch of an angel. She wants to master this ability on her own and seeks a oneness with God through a series of meditative disciplines while locked away in a monastery. Reception The novel was rejected for publication by Hall Caine‚Äîan act that began a lifelong feud between Caine and Corelli. After hearing of Caine's harsh criticism, George Bentley suspected that the novel might have commercial appeal and published Corelli's first novel. Marie Corelli did not expect A Romance of Two Worlds to be so well received. She claims, in the introduction to the second printing in 1887, that, \\"It was not only read, but loved.\\"Introduction: Romance of Two Worlds, second printing 1887 Her scripture, \\"The Electric Principle of Christianity,\\" included in the novel, is presented as something factual and after the publication of the book, generated a cult following, in which readers sought more information about her experience. Today, New Age devotees hail Corelli as \\"inspired\\". Many believe that the book is autobiographical, a belief which Corelli encouraged.A typical example is Two Worlds of Mackay (archive) in Bruce D. Despain's section on writings about the afterlife (accessed 2009-01-28).Reviews of the book on amazon.com also reflect this belief system. In several chapters Corelli hints that Heliobas may be the Count of St. Germain, although Rosicrucian authors identify him as an Illuminati hierophant, Count A. di Guinotti. Heliobas appears in two other Corelli novels, Ardath and The Soul of Lilith. Themes In A Romance of Two Worlds, Marie Corelli takes on an old argument between the creationists and the evolutionists. However, her insights are futuristic, including ideas about electricity, solar power, and the properties of the atom. She explains in the introduction, > in this cultivated age a wall of skepticism and cynicism is gradually being > built up by intellectual thinkers of every nation against all the treats of > the Supernatural and Unseen, I am aware that my narration of the events I > have recently experienced will be read with incredulity. At a time when the > great empire of the Christian Religion is being assailed, or politely > ignored by governments and public speakers and teachers, I realize to the > fullest extent how daring is any attempt to prove, even by a plain history > of strange occurrences happening to one's self, the actual existence of the > Supernatural around us; and the absolute certainty of a future state of > being, after the passage through that brief soul-topor in which the body > perishes, known to us as Death. The book is suffused with Pantheism. She also argues that Christ did not come to us as a sacrifice because God is a creator of love and beauty and could not desire \\"a bleeding victim as sacrifice to appease His Anger [...].\\" Notes External links * Category:1886 British novels Category:Novels by Marie Corelli Category:Victorian novels Category:1886 debut novels ","title":"A Romance of Two Worlds"},{"id":"17745912","text":"The National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, also known as NIMBB, is a research institute of the University of the Philippines.

He also made five appearances for England. Playing career Haworth was born in Accrington and played for Christ Church FC as a teenager from 1878 and in 1882 he was playing for Accrington. Haworth went on loan to Preston North End FC. In 1884 he was on loan to Blackburn Rovers (registration & fee required) and was a member of their team which won the FA Cup in 1885. The 1885 FA Cup Final was played at the Oval on 4 April against Scottish team Queen's Park, who were hoping to gain revenge for their defeat, in somewhat controversial circumstances, the previous year. This time there was little controversy and it was soon clear that Rovers were the superior side, even though Queens Park fielded six players who had appeared in the England v. Scotland match two weeks earlier. After 14 minutes, Jimmy Forrest got the better of his marker Charles Campbell and was able to fire Rovers in front from close range, after Jimmy Brown's shot had come back off the goal-posts. Although Walter Arnott did put the ball in the net just before half-time, referee Francis Marindin disallowed the \\"goal\\" for handball. The Scots continued to attack, but Rovers increased their lead on 58 minutes when Brown added a second goal. From this point, Rovers controlled the game, and claimed the trophy for the second consecutive year. For the 1885‚Äì86 season Haworth was back with Accrington, for whom he was registered for his five England appearances, making his debut against Ireland on 5 February 1887. Haworth was selected for all three matches in the 1887 British Home Championship.

England were able to gain revenge for the 1887 defeat by Scotland in the following year, when Haworth played at centre-half in a 5‚Äì0 victory, including two goals from Fred Dewhurst.Scotland 0 ‚Äì England 5; 17 March 1888 (Match summary) Haworth's final international appearance came two years later in a 1‚Äì1 draw with Scotland.Scotland 1 ‚Äì England 1; 5 April 1890 (Match summary) In 1888, Accrington were one of the twelve founder members of The Football League, and in their first league season Haworth played in all but one of the club's 22 matches, scoring once as Accrington finished seventh in the table. George Howarth scored at Thorneyholme Road, the then home of Accrington, on 29 December 1888. He put the home team 2‚Äì1 ahead of Everton and the final score was 3‚Äì1. Haworth played wing-half in a midfield that achieved a big (three goals or more) win on one occasion. He was part of the 1st League team to debut for Accrington on 8 September 1888 at Anfield, then home of Everton. Accrington lost to Everton 2‚Äì1 but finished above Everton in the League table. In the following season, Haworth was now team captain and \\"performed splendidly at the heart of the defence\\" as Accrington gained their highest league position with a sixth-place finish. Haworth continued at centre-half for Accrington over the next three seasons, before retiring in 1892. In the first round of the FA Cup in 1892, Haworth scored in a 4‚Äì1 victory over Crusaders, before going out to Sunderland in a replayed Second Round match.

This information was recorded in a physical document called a , kept by the municipality in which the subject lived. Any changes in registered information had to be reported to the municipal office.Legal Procedures for Your Residence in Japan: Alien Registration If a resident alien moved within Japan, they were required to report their move to the new municipality of residence, which then took possession of the t≈çroku genpy≈ç. The t≈çroku genpy≈ç was closed when the alien left Japan without a re-entry permit, and was then kept in an archive at the Ministry of Justice. Any subsequent entry to Japan by the same person required a new registration which was kept on a new t≈çroku genpy≈ç.  Alien registration card  After a person registered as an alien, they were issued a photographic identity document called a , abbreviated (as is common in Japan) to , and colloquially referred to in English as an \\"alien registration card\\" (\\"ARC\\") or \\"gaijin card\\". All aliens in Japan were required to carry their passport or ARC at all times. The issuance of an ARC generally took about two weeks from the filing of the application.Study in Japan Comprehensive Guide: FAQ Alien registration could also be evidenced by a , which is an A4-sized printed copy of the information currently on file, similar in form to the residency registration certificates used by Japanese nationals. Because this form of certificate did not contain the subject's photograph, it was not as widely accepted as the ARC for identity verification purposes, and was mainly used as a temporary certificate when an ARC was unavailable. The ARC had to be surrendered when the foreigner left Japan unless they had a valid re-entry permit in their passport.Immigration Bureau: Immigration Procedures Guidebook: Immigration Control Procedures for All foreign nationals: Departure Procedures foreign nationals  Legal alias  Registered aliens are allowed to adopt an or ÈÄöÂêç as a second legal name. This resembles the ÈÄöÁß∞ that Japanese are allowed to use ‚Äî for example, to continue using a maiden name at work and on bank accounts after marriage. Foreigners who are long-term residents of Japan, particularly ethnic Koreans whose families have lived in Japan for generations, often adopt Japanese names as aliases in order to integrate within society. Ethnic Japanese who live in Japan as resident aliens may use a legal alias to reflect their ancestral name. Legal aliases are also used when registering a seal in a different script than the applicant's legal name (e.g., in katakana rather than Latin script). A person is generally required to use their alias in public relations before registering it. The exact criteria vary by locality, but the most common evidence is mail addressed to the alias name. One common technique which applicants use to create this evidence is to label the post box at their registered residence using the alias, and then mail themselves a postcard or letter addressed to the alias. One may also pay one's NHK television fee under the alias, and then receive official bills using that alias. Aliases may be registered upon initial alien registration. If the alias is registered subsequently, upon registration of the alias, the registrant receives a handwritten notation indicating the legal alias on the reverse side of their alien registration card. Any registration certificate which is subsequently issued will show the alias in type in parentheses just below the holder's name. A registered alias may be used on credit cards, health insurance, bank accounts and other documents. However, such documents may cause difficulties in foreign countries where the holder does not have personal identification showing their Japanese alias; thus documents in the registrant's foreign name may be preferable in non-Japanese speaking locales. Foreigners may obtain a Japanese credit card with a photo.Sumitomo Mitsui Visa Japanese nationals often use aliases for non-official purposes. For example, women often continue to use their maiden names following marriage, even though they are required to adopt the same family name as their husband for their legal name. However, Japanese nationals are not permitted to use an alias for legal purposes: their name on any official document (e.g. domestic use Japanese identification) must match the name appearing in their family register and resident register. Japanese passports may contain alternate names in parentheses next to the family name or the given name if the Japanese can show a legal connection and use of these names overseas. Multiple alternate names are separated by slashes. Non-standard non-Hepburn romanization may also be used for the main names if one can show a legal connection using these spellings.Passport Hepburn and alternate name rules  Issues   Fingerprinting debate  From 1952 onward, alien registration required the applicant to provide fingerprints from all fingers. Resident Koreans and other groups opposed this provision as a human rights violation. Kathleen Morikawa saw fingerprinting as violating the Golden Rule and fought for a level playing field. The fingerprinting system was repealed for Special Permanent Residents in the 1980s and for other aliens in 1999. The fingerprint law was described in an Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights report, Prevention of Discrimination: The Rights of Non-Citizens (final report of the special rapporteur David Weissbrodt), as follows: The Japanese government has since introduced fingerprinting and photographing of foreigners, claiming that this is a terrorism control measure. Fingerprinting is conducted at the immigration checkpoint when entering Japan and is only conducted using the two index fingers. Japanese nationals and Special Permanent Residents are exempt from the procedure; long-term residency holders are requested to give fingerprint scans regardless. When enforced, 95 people out of 700,000 who had entered Japan in one month were refused entry.  Relation with other registration systems  The alien registration system was similar to, but completely separate from, the koseki system used to record Japanese families and the juminhyo system used to record individual residents. If a household contained any non-Japanese members, those people would not appear in the koseki or juminhyo alongside the Japanese members. However, both Japanese and non-Japanese members of a registered alien's family appear in the alien's registration certificate; therefore one alien registration certificate can be used to prove their familial relationship. One side effect of this situation was that it was impossible for an alien married to a Japanese national to be registered as the head of their household on a koseki or juminhyo. It was possible, however, to add a footnote to the Japanese spouse's records indicating that the alien is a . Foreign residents' registration system The Japanese government passed a law replacing the alien registration system with a residents' registration system. This new system started from July 9, 2012. The changes see non-Japanese residents recorded alongside Japanese residents in the j≈´minhy≈ç system. (Note the distinction between the koseki system, which has not changed, and the j≈´minhy≈ç). Under the new system, foreigners are issued a new identification card known as a by immigration authorities. Local city officials stopped issuing Alien Registration Cards and all foreigners are now issued Residence Cards by immigration authorities. Use of the old card was permitted until 8 July 2015, or when the resident's current status expired, whichever came first. With the system, the maximum length of a status (other than statuses such as ' long-term residence or ' special long-term residence) for foreign residents was extended from three to five years, and shorter periods for Students and dependent statuses are permitted; the maximum length of multiple re-entry permits also has been extended to 5 years (eiju status) or 6 years (teiji), in addition for stays of up to one year, a special re-entry permit can be applied for at the point of departure at no charge rather than having to apply to an Immigration bureau in advance. Residency status renewals are automatically reported to City Offices. Immigration Dept. penalties for failing to promptly report changes in address to the City Office may be quite severe.New Residency Management System ‚Äî Immigration BureauJapan Times Many foreigners not at (registered) addresses July 3, 2012. Retrieved on July 11, 2012 As was the case for Alien Registration, penalties for not carrying registration cards at all times are still likely to be heavy. Special Permanent Residents such as special Korean residents of Japan have a Special Permanent Resident Certificate instead of a Residence Card.

It was released in June 1967, on Epic Records BN 26304, and re-released on vinyl by Sundazed Records (2007). The album has a raw, non-limited instrumental mentality, for each member played many instruments; for example, David Lindley played guitar, banjo, fiddle, and mandolin, and Solomon Feldthouse played saz, bouzouki, dobro, vina, oud, doumbek, dulcimer, fiddle, guitar, and vocals. Background After forming in 1966, the group known then as The Kaleidoscope, won a recording contract with Epic Records. They first recorded a single \\"Please\\" backed by a non-album track \\"Elevator Man\\", that was released in December 1966. The album Side Trips was released in June 1967, and an additional single was released with album cut \\"Why Try\\" backed by non-album track \\"Little Orphan Nannie\\". The album combined rock & roll with roots and world music, and contained several traditional songs including Charlie Poole's \\"Hesitation Blues\\" and Cab Calloway's signature song \\"Minnie the Moocher\\". Among other cuts, bassist Chris Darrow contributed a couple of trippy songs, \\"If the Night\\" and \\"Keep Your Mind Open\\", while Solomon Feldthouse contributed an Eastern influenced \\"Egyptian Gardens\\". Soon after the release, they re- named themselves as simply Kaleidoscope. Reception Allmusic's retrospective review praised nearly all of the individual songs and called the album \\"arguably the most diverse effort of 1967\\", but concluded that enthusiasts and collectors would be better off getting the more comprehensive Pulsating Dreams anthology, which includes the entirety of Side Trips.

Life and works  Hunter was born in the East End of London. His father was George Hunter, a deputy engineer in the General Post Office. He entered The London Hospital in 1915 but left in World War I to become a surgeon probationer RNVR in HMS Faulkner in the Dover Patrol. After the war, he returned to The London Hospital and qualified in 1920. Following a series of house appointments, he became first assistant to Lord Dawson of Penn (1864‚Äì1945) and then was appointed Assistant Physician to The London Hospital in 1927. He completed his MD degree in 1922 and FRCP in 1929. Hunter became curator to the Medical School Museum in 1933, and during his 30 years in office collected specimens said to ‚Äòrepresent almost all that is worth having in morbid anatomy‚Äô. He later became Director of the Medical Research Council‚Äôs Department for Research in Industrial Medicine at The London Hospital. In 1925 he married Mathilda Bugnion, a graduate from Somerville College, Oxford and daughter of a Lutheran Pastor from Lausanne, Switzerland. They had four children, two of whom became doctors. In 1935 he gave a series of lectures to the Derby Medical Society on occupational diseases. These lectures were followed by other publications, often jointly with colleagues. These all culminated in his 1955 book The Diseases of Occupations which became a classic \\"as soon as it was published\\". It was said that he wrote all 1000 pages by getting up at 5 a.m. for 18 months. It has been criticized as \\"perhaps lacking in balance\\" and being \\"sometimes irrelevant\\" but \\"always entertaining and gaining immeasurably from its readability and its impact on the medical profession.\\" There followed a Penguin Book Health in Industry published in 1959. Hunter was founder Editor of the British Journal of Industrial Medicine.

Harold (1977) Jews on the Frontier: An Account of Jewish Pioneers and Settlers in Early America Henry Regnery Company, Chicago, Today, California has one of the largest Jewish-American populations at about 1 million, and the state's main Jewish communities are found in Los Angeles (esp. the western side like Westwood and the city of Beverly Hills) and the San Francisco Bay Area (i.e. San Francisco and Berkeley near Oakland). Also recent Russian Jewish immigration are settling in urban Jewish communities, such as the state capital of Sacramento and a smaller yet well-known Jewish community in Palm Springs. Jewish congregations Lewis A. Franklin moved to San Diego in 1851 and organized the first High Holiday services in southern California. Lewis A. Franklin was not the only person who wanted to help Jews form a congregation in San Francisco in 1849. Congregation Sherith Israel was also being born at that time. Congregation Sherith Israel, like Lewis A. Franklin's congregation, also did not have a permanent home. Finally, in 1852, the congregation bought land on Stockton Street and asked for donations so they could build a temple of their own. They did get the opportunity to build a temple, which was completed in one year and they soon had 110 members mostly from Northern Europe and England. \\"The service follows the correct Polish minhag (rite) and is strictly Orthodox\\" noted Israel J. Benjamin. Another temple in San Francisco in 1854 was Congregation Emanu-el. Emanu-el had a different path from Sherith Israel, because Sherith Israel was an orthodox temple. Emanu-el was a \\"reform\\" community. Their rabbi was Dr. Cohen who was originally from Germany, where the \\"reform' movement started. The congregation had 260 members, made up mostly of Germans and French natives. Jewish politicians Jews such as Charles Himrod, Solomon Star, J.M. Sampliner, and Phillip Wasserman were all mayors. There were over 30 Jewish mayors in the late 1800s and early 1900s. One Jewish mayor was Adolph Sutro, he was the mayor of San Francisco, California, 1895-1897. Adolph Sutro came from Prussia for trade like many Jews. He ran as the \\"Anti-Octopus\\" candidate and served one term. Solomon Star was born in Bavaria on December 20, 1840. When he was ten years old, he was sent to live with his uncle in Ohio. When the Civil War broke out he went to Missouri. He moved to Deadwood South Dakota and, in 1884, he was elected mayor of Deadwood. He was the mayor for nine years. In 1893 he was elected state senator. After his term he was elected for a second term as mayor in 1896. He died in 1917. States with large Mormon population were notably welcoming to Jews in the West and among the first to elect Jews to statewide office. Moses Alexander (November 13, 1853 ‚Äì January 4, 1932) was the second elected Jewish governor of a US state, serving as the 11th Governor of Idaho from 1915 until 1919. Simon Bamberger was the third Jewish governor of a US State and the first non-Mormon elected Governor of the State of Utah, serving as the fourth Governor of Utah (1917‚Äì1921) after it achieved statehood from territorial status in 1896. The first Jewish congresswoman in the United States was Florence Kahn, who represented California succeeding her husband Julius Kahn who died in the middle of his twelfth term. In addition to being a congresswoman, she taught English and history to high school students. She was involved in many Jewish organizations and motivated women across California to be a part of politics.

Establishment and mission In the late 1960s, mobile patrol coverage of the metropolitan Manila area was considered inadequate due to increasing crime which strained the capabilities of the local police forces. On 14 July 1967, Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos directed the organization of a special force to be known as the PC Metropolitan Command (MetroCom). It was to operate in the cities of Manila, Quezon City, Caloocan and Pasay, and in the municipalities of Marikina, Pasig, Makati, Mandaluyong, San Juan, Para√±aque, Las Pi√±as, Navotas, Malabon and Taguig. As crime continued to increase and become more severe in the greater Manila area, and smuggling and illegal fishing in the Manila Bay area became rampant, President Marcos issued Executive Order 120 on 16 February 1968 which expanded MetroCom into a Metropolitan Area Command (MAC). MetroCom proved to be an efficient force supporting the municipal and city police forces in the Manila area. On 8 July 1974, President Marcos issued Presidential Decree No. 421, making MetroCom the basis for a regional police command for the future Metro Manila region. All local police departments within the capital area were joined under national government control as the Metropolitan Police Force (MPF) and overseen by the commander of MetroCom. On 8 August 8 1975, Presidential Decree 765 was issued to integrate the Philippine Constabulary with the Integrated National Police (INP) as a renewed service branch of the Armed Forces, not just for national defense but for the protection of public security and order. With this act, MetroCom and MPF were united under joint command. By November 1975, with the formal designation of the National Capital Region, MetroCom was extended to cover what was then the municipality of Valenzuela.  Dissolution and replacement  Following the People Power Revolution in 1986, the PC-INP was replaced by the Philippine National Police (PNP) by an act of Congress in 1991. From 1986 to 1991, in line with the democratization of the police forces of the republic, MetroCom was renamed the PC Capital Region Command (PCCAPCOM, Spanish:Comando del Region Capital de la Constabularia Filipina, COMRECAP-CF). In 1992, it was again renamed the PNP Capital Region Command (PNPCAPCOM, Comando del Region Capital de la Policia Nacional), the basis of the current National Capital Region Police Office.

It differs from B. sessilis var. flabellifolia in having lobes at the base of many leaves. Taxonomy A painting of B. sessilis var. sessilis by Ferdinand Bauer As the autonymous variety, B. sessilis var. sessilis encompasses the type material of the species; thus collections of this variety date back to the 1791 visit of Archibald Menzies to King George Sound. However the autonym was not needed until 1996, when Alex George published the other three varieties. As this taxon was then placed within the genus Dryandra, this varieties name was then Dryandra sessilis var. sessilis. It was transferred to its current name in 2007, when Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele transferred Dryandra into Banksia. Distribution and habitat B. sessilis var. sessilis occurs in a wide belt running from Regans Ford and Moora in the north, southeast to Collie and Bremer Bay. Cultivation It is a hardy plant that tolerates a wide range of soils and conditions, including drought and moderate frost. It flowers heavily, and produces an abundance of honey.

The lockout prohibited patrons from entering pubs, bars and nightclubs after 2am in designated areas which included the council areas of Port Phillip, Stonnington, Melbourne (including the Docklands) and Yarra. Licensees that breached the lockout could be fined a maximum of $6,899. Protest poster Melbourne Locked Out, a protest group designed specifically for campaigning against the lockout, was a source of opposition. On 30 May 2008, a protest was held at the Treasury Gardens, with about 3,000 people attending. History The 2am lockout was announced on 2 May by then Premier John Brumby. One of the objectives of the lockout was to reduce 'bar hopping' between 2am and 6am. On 2 June at 4.30am, the first morning of the trial, a bouncer struck a reveler outside a bar. Brumby used the incident to justify the need for the lockout. Of the 457 premises that were originally planned to be bound by the lockout, 115 were granted exemption but must abide under a number of rules which include no passouts after 2am for smokers; passouts for food, cab etc.; no advertising the fact that they have exemptions, and extra security guards after 2am.

During this period, a simmering disagreement between commercial radio stations ‚Äì represented by Federation of Australian Radio Broadcasters (FARB) ‚Äì and the six largest record labels ‚Äì represented by Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) ‚Äì resulted in major United Kingdom and Australian pop songs being refused airplay.Kent, David Martin. (2002) The government-owned Australian Broadcasting Corporation ‚Äì which had its own copyright and royalty arrangement with recording and music publishing companies ‚Äì did not take part in the dispute. The ban did not extend to releases by American artists. Some radio disc jockeys, such as Stan Rofe, defied the ban by playing songs according to their personal tastes. Teen-oriented pop music newspaper Go-Set reported on the dispute: it interviewed affected musicians and its journalists argued for the removal of the ban. Once the ban was lifted, status quo ante resulted: APRA's record companies returned to supplying free promotional material and FARB's radio stations resumed playing their records. During the ban some Australian musicians recorded covers of UK artists' hits on previously minor labels. The Mixtures, for example, recorded Mungo Jerry's \\"In the Summertime\\" on the Fable Label which was released in August. It peaked at No. 1 for nine weeks to be displaced by \\"Yellow River\\" ‚Äì originally by Christie ‚Äì which was covered by two Australian groups, Jigsaw (from Melbourne) and Autumn (from Sydney). Music charts from the period indicate that in the years immediately following the ban, there was a significant reduction in the number of Australian acts who scored major chart peaks. Background The 1970 Radio Ban had its origins early in 1969. Following the enactment of the new Copyright Act 1968, a group of recording companies ‚Äì including most of the members of the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) ‚Äì decided to scrap a long-standing royalty agreement with commercial radio stations that dated back to the 1950s. The recording companies included five major overseas labels Polygram, EMI, RCA, CBS and Warner and Australia's leading local company, Festival. APRA and the record labels demanded payment for pop records played on commercial radio claiming they were providing free programming for radio stations. Record companies traditionally supplied stations with free promotional copies of new singles. The commercial radio lobby ‚Äì represented by the Federation of Radio Broadcasters (FARB) ‚Äì balked at the proposed levy. They argued they provided a large amount of free promotion for the records they played. The government-owned Australian Broadcasting Corporation ‚Äì which had its own copyright and royalty arrangement with recording and music publishing companies ‚Äì did not take part in the dispute. In April 1970, teen- oriented pop music newspaper Go-Set reported on the dispute and interviewed musicians including former King of Pop Normie Rowe. He feared \\"it could be a major blow to the Australian scene.\\" Other musicians expected the situation would be resolved. Radio disc jockey and Go-Set columnist Stan Rofe claimed discussions were progressing and the threat of a ban was over. Fellow columnist and compiler of the Go-Set National Top 40, Ed Nimmervoll, predicted that its charts would be compromised as local artists' record sales were dependent on radio play. After negotiations between the parties broke down in late May 1970, the recording companies imposed a six-month embargo on the supply of promotional records to radio stations. In retaliation, FARB members boycotted all new major label releases by UK or Australian artists, but not American artists, and refused to include records from these companies in their weekly chart surveys. This was a serious matter as there was only one Australian national pop chart, published by Go-Set, and most Top 40 charts were collated locally by individual radio stations in major cities and towns. Darryl Cotton, lead singer of pop group Zoot was concerned that the public would be unaware of new releases by local acts. Solo singer Ronnie Burns believed it would affect groups more than individuals, who had greater access to television shows. Another singer, Russell Morris, criticised the policy which led to the ban, \\"[the Government] didn't realise that the pop recording market is a very large and important industry\\". As from 30 May, Nimmervoll's charts in Go-Set were based on direct surveying of large record-selling stores instead of relying on radio stations' Top 40s. Some disc jockeys, including Rofe, defied the ban on their radio shows ‚Äì he regularly played \\"Turn Up Your Radio\\" by The Masters Apprentices which had been issued by EMI in April. Rofe also championed the cause of Australian musicians in Go-Set by criticising mainstream media coverage of the dispute. During the ban, many UK hits like The Beatles' \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" and Mary Hopkin's \\"Knock, Knock Who's There?\\" gained only limited exposure in Australia. Some local artists released cover versions of UK hits; Melbourne singer Liv Maessen's \\"Knock, Knock, Who's There\\" debuted in the Top 10 in May with co-credit to Hopkin and Maessen. It eventually peaked at No. 2 in early August and earned Maessen the first gold record ever awarded to an Australian female artist. \\"In the Summertime\\" by The Mixtures was a cover of Mungo Jerry's hit which reached No. 1 in August for nine weeks. Melbourne band Jigsaw and Sydney band Autumn both had success with their respective versions of Christie's hit song, \\"Yellow River\\". \\"Yellow River\\" displaced \\"In the Summertime\\" at No. 1 in late October. For a short period, the ban had the inadvertent effect of putting more local musicians to air than ever before, and also opened the door to the 'underground' artists on previously minor labels such as Fable Label. Music charts in the years immediately following the ban show there was a significant reduction in the number of Australian acts who scored major chart peaks. The Go-Set charts for 1972, for example, indicate that only two Australian acts (Colleen Hewett and Blackfeather) had national No. 1 hits; while in 1973 no Australian act scored a No. 1 hit.

She won numerous beauty contests growing up and was signed to a contract with a studio almost immediately after graduation from high school. However, her option was not picked up, something that was repeated with another studio, \\"so that made me want to study and become a good actress\\", she later said. In 1969, she was appointed queen of the Warner Bros-Seven Arts International Film Festival in Freeport, Grand Bahamas Island. She gained a level of fame with her appearance in the enormously popular The Big Doll House. This led to a series of roles in exploitation films.

He was most admired for his interpretations of the works of Giuseppe Verdi.MARCH 22 CLASSICALmanac 'today in classical music' Biography Giacomo Rimini was born and raised in Verona, Italy. His father, Riccardo Rimini, descended from Sephardic Jews long resident in Verona; his mother, Giulia Sottopera, was Catholic.A Biography by Charles Mintzer Rimini studied at the Verona Music Conservatory with Amelia Conti Foroni. He began his operatic career in Italy in his early twenties. His first lead role was as Escamillo in Bizet's Carmen at the age of 22. In 1910 he sang the role of Albert in Massenet's Werther at the municipal theatre of Desenzano. He sang with many notable Italian opera houses over the next several years including the Teatro Regio (Turin), the Teatro Massimo in Palermo, and at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome. In 1915, Rimini was chosen by Arturo Toscanini to sing the title role in Verdi's Falstaff at the Teatro del Verme in Milan. He reprised the role later that year with Toscanini at La Scala in the presence of King Victor Emmanuel III.\\"GIACOMO RIMINI, 63, OPERATIC BARITONE; Celebrated Chicagoan Who Had Been Selected by Toscanini Dies--U. S. Debut in '16\\", \\"The New York Times\\" 1952-03-06. Also in 1915, Rimini met in Bologna Polish Jewish opera singer Rosa Raisa and the two of them fell in love with each other. They moved to Chicago, Illinois in 1916 where they would both establish a long association with the Chicago City Opera Company, the Chicago Civic Opera, and the Ravinia Festival. Rimini had been married once previously to a woman from Rome, Raffaella Bettei. Rimini and Raisa married in 1920 after moving to Chicago and became naturalized citizens of the United States in 1923. Rimini and Raisa had one daughter, Rosa Giulietta (Jolly) Segala, who was born in July 1931.TIME In addition to Falstaff and Escamillo, Rimini was admired for his portrayals of the title role in Verdi's Rigoletto, Iago in Verdi's Otello, Amonasro in Verdi's Aida, Renato in Verdi's Un ballo in maschera, Figaro in Rossini's Il barbiere di Siviglia, Tonio in Pagliacci, Barnaba in Amilcare Ponchielli's La Gioconda among others. In addition to frequently singing opposite his wife on the operatic and concert stage, Rimini also performed frequently with Amelita Galli-Curci. The two of them sang their first Figaro and Rosina in Il barbiere di Siviglia together with the Chicago Opera Company among many other performances. Although Rimini primarily worked in Chicago, he and his wife did occasionally travel to other parts of the United States and in South America for performances, usually performing together. They also maintained a villa in Verona where they would spend their summers and occasionally appear in operas. Most notably, Rimini originated the role of Ping in Puccini's Turandot at La Scala in 1926 opposite his wife in the title role. He also was the first person to completely record the role of Falstaff, which he also did with La Scala forces in 1932. In 1933 the Riminis appeared in a European tour with Teatro alla Scala's singers, which included a one-week series of performances at the St√§dtische Oper in Berlin, Germany. It was controversial due to the Jewish Raisa‚Äôs participation, and Rimini‚Äôs half-Jewish ‚Äòracial‚Äô status. In the following years, while Raisa preferred to concentrate on her Chicago engagements, Rimini appeared frequently in Italy having the opportunity to sing with many of the Italian operatic luminaries of the time. Rimini and his wife both announced their retirement from the operatic stage in 1937. Due to the Fascist Racial Laws and the Second World War they stayed away from Italy from 1939 to 1946. In Chicago, they decided to concentrate their time to teaching the next generation of opera singers. They had opened a voice/opera school in Chicago which they ran for two decades. As a part of the school, students would travel to Italy with Rimini and his wife to study in Verona, often staying at their teacher's villa. Giacomo Rimini died in his sleep on March 6, 1952 at his home in Chicago.

The members are consequently said to be incorporated, or to form a corporation. History Colleges existed among the Romans and Greeks from the earliest times. The Roman laws required at least three persons for constituting a college. Legal incorporation was made, at least in some cases, by decrees of the Senate, edicts of the emperor, or by special laws. There were, however, general laws under which colleges could be formed by private persons, and if the authorities judged that the members had conformed to the letter and spirit of these laws, they had incontestable rights as collegia legitima; if the requisites were not adhered to they could be suppressed by administrative act. The Colleges could hold property in common and could sue and be sued. In case of failure this common property could be seized, but that of the individual members was not liable to seizure. The Roman collegium was never instituted as a corporation sole; still, when reduced to one member, that individual succeeded to all the rights of the corporation and could employ its name.J. F. Keating, \\"Roman Legislation on Collegia and Sodalicia\\" in \\"The Agape\\", London, 1901, p. 180 sqq. Colleges were formed among the ancient Romans for various purposes. Some of these had a religious object, as the college of the Arval Brothers, of the Augurs, etc.; others were for administrative purposes, as of qu√¶stors, tribunes of the people; others again were trade unions or guilds, as the colleges of bakers, carpenters. The early Roman Christians are said to have sometimes held church property during times of persecution under the title of collegium.For the evidence of this, see H. Leclercq, Manuel d'Arch√©olog. Chr√©t. (Paris, 1907, I, 261-66). It is not admitted by Louis Duchesne, Hist. anc. de l'Eglise (Paris 1906, I). Canon law Most of the prescriptions of the ancient civil law were received into the law of the Roman Catholic Church and they are incorporated in the Corpus Juris Canonici. By canonists, a college has been defined as a collection of several rational bodies forming one representative body. Some authors consider \\"university\\" and \\"community\\" as synonymous terms with college, but others insist that there are points of difference. Thus, there are canonists who define university as a collection of bodies distinct from one another, but employing the same name specially conferred upon them. Pirhing remarks that a community of priests attached to the same church do not form a college unless they are members of one body whose head is a prelate elected by that body. According to canon law three persons are required to form a college. Some authors maintained that two were sufficient for the purpose, because Pope Innocent, alluding to St. Matthew, xviii, 20, says that no presbyter is to be chosen for a church where two or three form the congregation, except by their canonical election. As congregation here evidently means college, these writers contend that two can therefore form a college. As a matter of fact, however, the pontiff is simply affirming that the right of election will remain with an already constituted college even though only two of its members remain after the death of the prelate. Pirhing gives as the reason why two cannot constitute a college, that though it be not necessary that the college actually have a head, yet it must be at least capable of giving itself a presiding officer, or rector of the college. If, then, there be only two members and one be constituted the head, the other can not form the body, for the body requires several members, and the head is distinct from the body. He does not mean to assert, however, that if a college be reduced to two members, it can not preserve its corporate rights. On the contrary, the canon law explicitly affirms that one surviving member can conserve the privileges of the corporate body, not for himself personally, but for the college. When a legally constituted college has been reduced to two members, one can elect the other as prelate. If the college be reduced to one member, it becomes a virtual, not an actual, corporation. The single remaining member can exercise the acts belonging to the college, and although he can not elect himself prelate, yet he can choose or nominate some other proper person to the prelacy. He may also commit the election to other persons, or even to one, as the bishop. The ancient canonists, when stating that three constitute a college, give also the numbers requisite for other canonical bodies, thus: five are necessary to form a university, two a congregation, more than two a family, and ten a parish. Among conspicuous ecclesiastical colleges may be mentioned the College of Cardinals and collegiate and cathedral chapters. The name college is specially applied also to corporate educational bodies within the Church, as without it. Before the Protestant Reformation, and even in the first years of Elizabeth I of England, the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge were always spoken of as ecclesiastical corporations. By English law they are now purely lay corporations. Apostolic Colleges The title \\"Apostolic College\\" is applied in Rome to those institutions which are immediately subject to and controlled by the Holy See, and are consequently exempt from any other spiritual or temporal authority; the students are declared to be under the direct protection of the pope. Such institutions are, among others, the College of the Propaganda, and the Roman Colleges.

It was formed in 1906 when liberal party structures were becoming more solid. Its leader, Archibald Peake, stressed that the LDU represented 'something not so sharply set as Labourism, not so dull in its edge as conservatism'. But with Labor taking over the middle ground, Kingstonian liberals like Peake had to choose. At the 1905 election, Peake sought a Liberal alliance with Price Labor: 'the only difference between us is a difference of degree and of speed'. The Price- Peake administration was formed. At the 1906 election, the LDU won 10 percent of the vote and nine of 42 seats and continued to support the Price Labor government. When Price died in 1909, Labor as the largest single party in the lower house demanded it retain the premiership in their coalition, however Peake refused. Invited to form a ministry, he filled it with LDU members and became premier, treasurer and minister of education. The ministry survived with the parliamentary support of two independent conservative parties, the Australasian National League (formerly National Defence League) and the Farmers and Producers Political Union, and in December was reconstructed to include members of both. John Verran led Labor to South Australia's first majority government with 22 of 42 seats from a 49.1 percent primary vote at the 1910 election. The three anti-Labor parties endorsed a shared \\"Liberal\\" slate of candidates, winning a combined 20 of 42 seats from a 49.6 percent combined primary vote. Later in 1910 after the election, the parties merged and formed the Liberal Union with Peake as leader. The parties readily approved the merger, however, the LDU which salvaged the fewest of their principles from the merger were more hesitant. Peake persuaded a party conference that 'the day of the middle party is passed', and approved the merger by just one vote.

The Government then caused a CDA to be established by amending the Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand, BE 2534 (1991) to make provisions for having a new constitution. At that time, the CDA established consisted of 99 members being 76 deputies elected by citizens of 76 Chanagwats, and 23 academicians from higher education institutes. Bhumibol Adulyadej appointed Uthai Phimchaichon as the CDA President. The success of the CDA was the well-known Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand, BE 2540 (1997).  2007  The CDA has been established once again after the Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand, BE 2540 (1997) has been abrogated by the Council for Democratic Reform (CDR), a military junta which seized power in 2006. It consisted of 100 members, being 28 from the public service sector, 27 from the private sector, 23 from the social sector and 22 from the academic sector, or being 10 from the northern region, 68 from the central region, 12 from the eastern region and 10 from the southern region. Such 100 members were selected on 27 December 2006 by the CDR from the nominations submitted by the National People's Assembly, and appointed by Bhumibol Adulyadej on 2007, 1 January. The King's royal command appointing CDA members was countersigned by the CDR Leader Sonthi Boonyaratglin. The members selected amongst themselves Noranit Setthabut as their President, Decho Sawananon, their 1st Vice President and Kroekkiat Phiphatseritham, their 2nd Vice President.

For example, if a certain Church council is an ecumenical council then this is connected with dogma, for every ecumenical council is endowed with infallibility and jurisdiction over the Catholic Church; If a Church council is ecumenical then their rendering of documents will be the canon of that document, with natural providence secondary to divine providence. Ecumenical councils can make dogmatic facts. In a stricter sense, the term dogmatic fact is confined to books and spoken discourses. With this, the ecumenical council example can be made clearer. If a ecumenical council declared a writing unorthodox, even were this not the authors intention and indeed the author made no argument against orthodox, or even if later books having the same teachings were not so declared, the earlier work can nonetheless remain unorthodox on account of how the work was understood (or misunderstood) by wider interpretations. Thus, one purpose of a dogmatic fact is readily seen; a dogmatic fact allows the Roman Catholic Church to arbitrate as to which other Churches are Roman Catholic, separate from what those Churches themselves claim, or in fact, actually believe. Do note a dogmatic fact can also be correct in senses other than 'dogmatically', such as a writer truly being subversive to canon and duly labelled, even if they protested otherwise. The example of Jansenism The meaning in a case of historical significance can be explained by a reference to the condemnation by Pope Innocent X of five propositions taken from the posthumous book of Jansenius, entitled Augustinus. Could the pope define that Jansenius really was the author of the book entitled Augustinus? No, he may speak of it as the work of Jansenius, because, in general repute, at least, it was regarded as the work of Jansenius. The precise authorship of a book is called a personal fact. The question turned on the doctrine of the book. The Jansenists admitted that the doctrine enunciated in the condemned propositions was heretical; but they maintained that the condemned doctrine was not taught in the Augustinus. This brings us to what are called \\"particular facts of doctrine\\". Thus it is a fact (in this sense) that God exists, and that there are Three Persons in God; here the same thing is fact and dogma. The Jansenists admitted that the pope is competent to deal with particular facts of doctrine, but not to determine the meaning of a book. The controversy was then carried to the meaning of the book. The pope cannot define the purely internal, subjective, perhaps singular meaning, which an author might attach to his words. But the pope, in certain cases, can determine the meaning of a book judged by the general laws of interpretation. And when a book or propositions from a book are condemned, \\"in the sense of the author\\", they are condemned in the sense in which the book or propositions would be understood when interpreted according to the ordinary laws of language. The same formula may be condemned in one author and not in another, because, interpreted by the context and general argument of the author, it may be unorthodox in one case and not in another. In the strict sense, therefore, a dogmatic fact may be defined as \\"the orthodox or heterodox meaning of a book or proposition\\"; or as a \\"fact that is so connected with dogma that a knowledge of the fact is necessary for teaching and conserving sound doctrine\\". That a book contains unorthodox doctrine, conveys that a certain doctrine is unorthodox; here we have close connection between fact and dogma. The Catholic Church and dogmatic facts Jansenists distinguished between \\"fact\\" and \\"dogma\\". They held that the Catholic Church is infallible in defining revealed truth and in condemning errors opposed to revealed truth, but that the Church is not infallible in defining facts which are not contained in divine revelation. Consequently they held that the Church was not infallible in declaring that a particular doctrine, in a particular sense, was found in the Augustinus of Jansenius. Catholic theologians teach that the Church, or the pope, is infallible, not only in defining what is formally contained in divine revelation, but also in defining virtually revealed truths, or generally in all definitions and condemnations which are necessary for safe-guarding the body of revealed truth. Whether it is to be regarded as a defined doctrine, as a doctrine de fide, that the Church is infallible in definitions about dogmatic facts, is disputed among theologians. The Catholic Church has always exercised the right of pronouncing with authority on dogmatic facts. She has always claimed the right of defining that the doctrine of heretics, in the sense in which it is contained in their books, or in their discourses, is heretical; that the doctrine of an orthodox writer, in the sense in which it is contained in his writings, is orthodox. Faith and dogmatic facts The more extreme Jansenists, distinguishing between dogma and fact, taught that the dogma is the proper object of faith but that to the definition of fact only respectful silence is due. They refused to subscribe the formula of the condemnation of Jansenism, or would subscribe only with a qualification, on the ground that subscription implied internal assent and acquiescence. The less extreme party, though limiting the Church's infallibility to the question of dogma, thought that the formula might be signed absolutely and without qualification, on the ground that, by general usage, subscription implied assent to the dogma, but, in relation to the fact, only external reverence. But the definitions of dogmatic facts demand real internal assent; though about the nature of the assent and its relation to faith theologians are not unanimous. Some theologians hold that definitions of dogmatic facts, and especially of dogmatic facts in the wider acceptation of the term, are believed by divine faith. For instance, the proposition, \\"every pope duly elected is the successor of Peter\\", is formally revealed. Other theologians hold that the definitions of dogmatic facts, in the wider and stricter acceptation, are received, not by divine faith, but by ecclesiastical faith, which some call mediate divine faith. They hold that in such syllogisms as this: \\"Every duly elected pontiff is Peter's successor; but Pius X, for example, is a duly elected pontiff; therefore he is a successor of Peter\\", the conclusion is not formally revealed by God, but is inferred from a revealed and an unrevealed proposition, and that consequently it is believed, not by divine, but by ecclesiastical faith.

Location The phase covered a region in the South Appalachian geologic province. On the rim of the region during an earlier phase, the sites were occupied for rather short periods, with the interior of the region having sites occupied throughout the phase. Between about 1000 and 1250 CE, the region of northeastern Tennessee, western North Carolina and northwestern South Carolina was a subregional developmentKeel, a \\"Paper\\" of a local Woodland period population who incorporated characteristics from the larger Mississippian culture.Geier (1992),284‚Äì285 The villages ranged from about a quarter of an acre to which complexity and cultural pattern does not compare in size to the Mississippian in the south and west.Dickens; also Purrington (1983), 145‚Äì147 However, the Mississippian cultural pattern influence was as far north as Lee County, Virginia, and south to Oconee County, South Carolina.Dickens (1976), 211 Pee Dee culture expresses Pisgah cultural traits.Ward and Davis, 99 Lifeways Subsistence Pisgah Phase peoples, like other Mississippian culture peoples, consumed a variety of wild animal and plant foods. They hunted the wooded uplands for white-tailed deer, bear, and wild turkey. But unlike their predecessors in the region, they were also heavily dependent on maize agriculture, with as much as half of their food being derived from agriculture. The rich bottomlands near their villages were planted with many staples of indigenous agriculture, including the Three Sisters (corn, beans, and squash/pumpkin), and sumpweed (Iva annua). Architecture Pisgah Phase sites ranged from individual farmsteads to large nucleated villages with platform mounds and palisades, usually with the smaller sites clustering around the larger mound centers. They were invariably located within floodplains; the exceptions being temporary hunting camps. The majority of the sites are located in the Eastern and Central Appalachian Summit area, around the Asheville, Pigeon, and Hendersonville basins. Some Pisgah Phase sites, such as the Garden Creek Mound site, have been found to have earth lodges during early phases of their occupation. At times these earth lodges either collapsed or were destroyed, and a platform mound constructed over them. This is interpreted by archaeologists as a shift in sociopolitical organization and community hierarchy. It is believed the earth lodges were used as egalitarian council houses and that the superimposition of substructure mounds for temples, chiefly residences and mortuary structures signaled a shift to a more stratified society with hereditary elites. The houses of the Pisgah Phase were about square and tended to be rectangular. Walls were of single set post construction with wattle and daub as a finishing material. Structures had interior support posts and interior partitions. Trenches were dug for an entry way, with rows of saplings arched over them and covered in wattle and daub for a tunnel like effect. The floors had a raised hearth in the center. Around the houses within the palisade were common burials, fire pits and clay deposits used for storage pits and some as fire pits. There is evidence of smaller structures near the houses which are thought to be storage cribs for maize and sweat houses. A larger council house fronted the homes surrounding the central plaza opposite the village entrance. The palisades had off-set entrances. Burial There are three types of burials associated with the Pisgah Phase. These are side-chamber pits, central-chamber pits and simple pits. High ranking adults and infants were placed within the side-chamber location in a loose flexed position with their head towards the west. The burials have produced adult skulls showing artificial cranial deformation. The adult graves also had shell ear pins, turtle-shell rattles, shell bowls and perforated animal bones. The infant's grave objects included calumella shell beads, shell gorgets and perforated marginella shells. Included within certain graves in some sites show a social ranking having stone, clay, bone, shell and wood artifacts. Ceramics While William Henry Holmes of the Smithsonian Institution first identified Pisgah ceramics in 1884, Patricia Holden was the first to publish a detailed analysis of Pisgah pottery in 1966. Pisgah Phase pottery, unlike the vast majority of Mississippian culture pottery, used sand as a tempering agent instead of ground mussel shell. The pottery is typified by collared rims and rectilinear, complicated stamp decoration. The designs are similar to northern Iroquois ceramics. The complicated stamping designs was found to be like Etowah of the Piedmont region and Hiwassee Island designs of the Ridge and Valley province.King Bolder check stamping becomes a minority style and some having rectilinear motifs, some curvilinear towards the end of the phase. For the most part, these became more common on the Blue Ridge basins of western North Carolina and northwestern South Carolina after 1250 CE. The following Qualla Phase pottery is thought to be the result of the merging of Lamar and Pisgah Phases lifestyles about 1450 CE.Keel (1976), 312 Chronological position The Pisgah Phase is a part of the Southern Appalachian Summit Archaeology which includes the following chronology: *Archaic Period, ca. 7500‚Äì4300 BCE *Morrow Mountain Phase, ca. 4300‚Äì2500 BCE *Savannah River Phase, ca. 2500‚Äì750 BCE *Swannanoa Phase, ca. 750~150 BCE *Pigeon Phase, ca. 200 BCE‚Äì100 CE *Connestee Phase, 150‚Äì1000 CE *Pisgah Phase, 1000-1500 CE *Qualla Phase, ca. 1500 CE‚Äì1850 CE Sites Most Pisgah sites are found along the Catawba, French Broad, Hiwassee, Little Tennessee, and Pigeon rivers in North Carolina.Dickens (1974), Figure 2 Specific sites include the following: *Asheville *Blair Mound, near Winnsboro, South Carolina *Brunk Site, Buncombe County, North Carolina *Garden Creek Mound (31HW1), *Hendersonville *McDowell Site (31MC41), in McDowell County, North Carolina *Pigeon *Ward site, Watauga County, North Carolina *Warren Wilson site, east of Asheville Notes References *Dickens, Roy S.

The mall is owned by Robinsons Malls, and it is their flagship mall. It was built in 1990 with a total gross floor area of approximately . The mall Robinsons Galleria is a 5-level shopping mall and a landmark along EDSA and Ortigas Avenue with more than 400 shops, dining outlets, entertainment facilities and service centers. It is located within a mixed-use complex composed of two high-rise office towers, the Galleria Corporate Center and Robinsons Equitable Tower. Three hotels are also located among the said towers, the Holiday Inn Manila Galleria and Crowne Plaza Manila Galleria, and the Galleria Regency. A major tenant of the mall is the central passport office of the Department of Foreign Affairs in Metro Manila called DFA Consular Office NCR-Central, which is located on the first floor of the Lingkod Pinoy Center, and which was inaugurated in September 2012.  History  The mall's location was once an open land owned by the SSS at Ortigas Central Business District. In February 1986, the portion of the land facing EDSA was where participants in the People Power Revolution also protested; tanks going north to Camp Aguinaldo and Camp Crame were stopped at this spot. In 1987, John Gokongwei bought the large portion of the land from the SSS, while the Archdiocese of Manila had partly purchased the portion of the land near the intersection. This plot today is the site of EDSA Shrine, which belongs to the Archdiocese. Construction began in mid-1988 and finished in late 1989. The mall opened in 1990, being the first mall of Robinsons Malls. Since its opening, several renovations had made within the mall, expanding its area to 216,000 square meters. Incidents March 2012 robbery On March 29, 2012, one guard was killed and six others wounded after two armed robbers lobbed a couple of grenades while fleeing with their loot. The Philippine National Police spokesman Chief Superintendent Agrimero Cruz Jr. said that by 10:15 AM, two unidentified suspects in disguise as guards attacked two bank guards who were escorting bank tellers and were supposed to deliver an undetermined amount of money in a money changer shop at the mall's ground floor. October 2013 fire On October 29, 2013 a fire broke out inside the department store's toy section. The fire started at around 11:00 PM when the employees who were decorating Christmas lights inside the mall rushed out the mall to flee the premises. Guests from the Holiday Inn evacuated and moved to the adjacent Crowne Plaza Hotel. The fire raged for about six hours. The fire was under control the next morning, and the mall was closed for two days. The mall soon reopened by noon on November 1, 2013. Redevelopment The mall had gone for several renovations since it opened in 1990. In 2012, the mall took its major facelift with additional GLA of around 100,000 square meters that can cater at least 50 tenants. The said developments expanded the mall's GLA to what is now 216,000 square meters. The latest redevelopment had started in 2016. It will be done in 2 phases with its first phase of renovation from May to October 2016 while the second phase was to start in May 2017. Aside from the major renovations within the mall, the mall veranda will host more service stores related to health and beauty. There will be an upper veranda at the 3rd floor, formerly occupying the sports loop, which will accommodate more dining choices. The mall's renovation is almost complete. The mall's renovation will add wooden elements into the mall, a design similar to Robinsons Galleria Cebu. Urban legend There was an urban legend in the 1990s about a half- snake, half-human creature that resided in the basement of the mall. It was claimed as a lucky charm installed by the Gokongwei family. The story claimed that Filipino actresses Alice Dixson and Rita Avila were among the victims of the creature. Based on the story Dixson survived while Avila died and the one who appears today on television is purportedly a clone. Many female shoppers avoided its department store during that time. Although the rumor is now considered absurd and dead, it revived in 2010 after a supposed YouTube video depicting it. Dixson herself has dismissed the entire narrative as fake.

She gained global notoriety in 2007 when she took on the World Health Organization's practice of sharing avian influenza virus samples. In June 2017, she was convicted of corruption and sentenced to four years in jail for accepting bribes concerning the procurement of medical equipment. Minister of Health Supari as Minister of Health (2004) Supari was appointed Minister of Health by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on 20 August 2004. She served until 22 October 2009 when she was succeeded by Endang Rahayu Sedyaningsih, an epidemiologist and close advisor in her team. Influenza debate and standoff with WHO On 3 August 2006, Supari made the unprecedented move by announcing that the Indonesian government will make genomic data on bird flu viruses accessible to anyone. Supari said, opening up global access could be the key to unlocking such vital information as to the origin of the virus, how it causes disease, how it is mutating, the sources of infection, and how to prevent or cure the virus. \\"But in future cooperation on bird flu with other countries, the delivery of specimens should be regulated under Material Transfer Agreement documents as is commonly practised in scientific cooperation,\\" Supari added. The Economist wrote, Supari started a revolution that could yet save the world from the ravages of a pandemic disease. That is because Indonesia's health minister has chosen a weapon that may prove more useful than today's best vaccines in tackling such emerging threats as avian flu: transparency. It was unclear at the time what prompted Supari to share data, given the widespread reluctance of countries affected by the H5N1 virus to share their data, out of fear such disclosure could trigger economic sanctions. Just days before, an editorial published in Nature highlighted this problem with China's practice of belatedly publishing details of a case that tested positive for the virulent H5N1 strain in 2003 ‚Äî contradicting the government's official line that none had occurred before November 2005. Although not mentioning Supari by name, the editorial also addressed a confirmation by the World Health Organization (WHO) that a cluster of eight cases in an extended family in Northern Sumatra was the first unequivocal occurrence of limited human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 virus. On 22 August 2006, two weeks after Supari made her announcement, Nancy Cox, the director of the influenza division at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) communicated in a press release that following Indonesia's announcement, it too made genomic data on bird flu viruses publicly accessible. The following day a correspondence letter appeared in Nature shedding light on what had triggered the sudden shift in Supari's stance and that of the CDC. The scientific community had just been introduced to Peter Bogner, the new driving force in the virus sharing debate. Supari would later describe in her book an affinity for Peter Bogner, his plea to her government to share its bird flu virus data and his concern when she annoyed the US administration at times. Supari wrote, \\"he told me indirectly my speech had been too sharp,\\" or \\"Peter Bogner has the capability to change the world's opinions.\\" A former broadcast executive at Time Warner, he was not only familiar with intellectual property issues, but more importantly, he was friendly with Supari's government following his role in the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami relief efforts. He would turn out to be the mastermind behind the GISAID initiative, a mechanism devised and financed almost exclusively by him. When Supari attended the 61st World Health Assembly on 16 May 2008, the day GISAID's database was launched, Supari made available genetic H5N1 data alongside other countries like China and Russia. Within four months, this publicly accessible resource offered the world's most comprehensive collection of influenza data. Claiming Western governments could be developing viruses for dissemination in the developing world with the goal of generating business for pharmaceutical companies, Supari refused WHO researchers access to Indonesia's H5N1 bird flu virus samples in 2006. Indonesia resumed sending some H5N1 samples to WHO after a new agreement that developing nations would get access to vaccines. 2009 flu pandemic During a press conference on 28 April 2009, Supari reassured the public over the government's response to the swine flu threat and responded to a question on the origin of the H1N1 virus and whether it could have been man-made. Supari stated she was not sure whether the virus was genetically engineered, but it is a possibility. Several news outlets, among them Bloomberg News and the Times of India, reported about an investigation by the WHO into a claim by Australian researchers that the swine flu virus circling the globe may have been created as a result of human error. Australian virologists Adrian Gibbs, John Armstrong and Jean Downie suggested in a paper published in the Virology Journal, the new H1N1 strain, may be the product of three strains from three continents that swapped genes in a lab or a vaccine-making plant, suggesting its origin could be more simply explained by human involvement than a coincidence of nature. On 12 May 2009, Supari expressed her dissatisfaction of seeing many foreign medical students in Indonesia. She asked Universitas Padjadjaran Rector, Bandung to cut down foreign student intake in phases especially from Malaysia while visiting Cicendo Eyes Hospital, Bandung. Supari was instrumental in the termination of the United States Naval Medical Research Unit Two presence in Jakarta, and NAMRU-2 departed Indonesia in 2010. A 2008 memo revealed by WikiLeaks indicated her personal suspicion of an \\"American military laboratory\\" in Indonesia not under her control. This is despite the fact that NAMRU-2 had been operating in Indonesia on the campus of the Indonesia Ministry of Health for decades.https://www.wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/08JAKARTA815_a.html Personal life Supari is a cardiology research specialist based in Jakarta. Supari was married for 36 years to Muhammad Supari until his death in 2009. She is fond of karaoke singing and sang for her husband just days before his death. Corruption conviction On 16 June 2017, Supari was convicted of corruption and sentenced to four years in jail. The Jakarta Corruption Court found she had accepted bribes related to the procurement of medical equipment for the Health Ministry's crisis centre in 2005. She was fined IDR 200 million (US$15,042), although her actions had caused IDR 6.15 billion in state losses. The court ruled she had abused her authority as a minister by accepting bribes of IDR 3.2 billion from two directors of PT Graha Ismaya in the form of traveller's checks. She was ordered to return IDR 550 million to the state after previously returning IDR 1.35 billion. Her former subordinate Rustam Pakaya was also sentenced to four years in jail over a 2007 procurement corruption case that caused IDR 21.3 billion in state losses.

An edition with handwritten corrections and additions was released in the early 1970s. An expanded edition was further published in 1987, containing a chapter dedicated to counter the criticisms made of it in the 1980s. The main subject of the book is the perceptron, a type of artificial neural network developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The book was dedicated to psychologist Frank Rosenblatt, who in 1957 had published the first model of a \\"Perceptron\\". Rosenblatt and Minsky knew each other since adolescence, having studied with a one-year difference at the Bronx High School of Science. They became at one point central figures of a debate inside the AI research community, and are known to have promoted loud discussions in conferences, yet remained friendly. This book is the center of a long-standing controversy in the study of artificial intelligence. It is claimed that pessimistic predictions made by the authors were responsible for a change in the direction of research in AI, concentrating efforts on so-called \\"symbolic\\" systems, a line of research that petered out and contributed to the so-called AI winter of the 1980s, when AI's promise was not realized. The meat of Perceptrons is a number of mathematical proofs which acknowledge some of the perceptrons' strengths while also showing major limitations. The most important one is related to the computation of some predicates, such as the XOR function, and also the important connectedness predicate. The problem of connectedness is illustrated at the awkwardly colored cover of the book, intended to show how humans themselves have difficulties in computing this predicate.Minsky-Papert 1972:74 shows the figures in black and white. The cover of the 1972 paperback edition has them printed purple on a red background, and this makes the connectivity even more difficult to discern without the use of a finger or other means to follow the patterns mechanically. This problem is discussed in detail on pp.136ff and indeed involves tracing the boundary.  Background  The perceptron is a neural net developed by psychologist Frank Rosenblatt in 1958 and is one of the most famous machines of its period. In 1960, Rosenblatt and colleagues were able to show that the perceptron could in finitely many training cycles learn any task that its parameters could embody. The perceptron convergence theorem was proved for single-layer neural nets. During this period, neural net research was a major approach to the brain-machine issue that had been taken by a significant number of individuals. Reports by the New York Times and statements by Rosenblatt claimed that neural nets would soon be able to see images, beat humans at chess, and reproduce. At the same time, new approaches including symbolic AI emerged. Different groups found themselves competing for funding and people, and their demand for computing power far outpaced available supply.  Contents  Perceptrons: An Introduction to Computational Geometry is a book of thirteen chapters grouped into three sections. Chapters 1‚Äì10 present the authors' perceptron theory through proofs, Chapter 11 involves learning, Chapter 12 treats linear separation problems, and Chapter 13 discusses some of the authors' thoughts on simple and multilayer perceptrons and pattern recognition.  Definition of perceptron  Minsky and Papert took as their subject the abstract versions of a class of learning devices which they called perceptrons, \\"in recognition of the pioneer work of Frank Rosenblatt\\". These perceptrons were modified forms of the perceptrons introduced by Rosenblatt in 1958. They consisted of a retina, a single layer of input functions and a single output. Besides this, the authors restricted the \\"order\\", or maximum number of incoming connections, of their perceptrons. Sociologist Mikel Olazaran explains that Minsky and Papert \\"maintained that the interest of neural computing came from the fact that it was a parallel combination of local information\\", which, in order to be effective, had to be a simple computation. To the authors, this implied that \\"each association unit could receive connections only from a small part of the input area\\". Minsky and Papert called this concept \\"conjunctive localness\\".  Parity and connectedness  Two main examples analyzed by the authors were parity and connectedness. Parity involves determining whether the number of activated inputs in the input retina is odd or even, and connectedness refers to the figure-ground problem. Minsky and Papert proved that the single- layer perceptron could not compute parity under the condition of conjunctive localness and showed that the order required for a perceptron to compute connectivity grew impractically large.  The XOR affair  Some critics of the book state that the authors imply that, since a single artificial neuron is incapable of implementing some functions such as the XOR logical function, larger networks also have similar limitations, and therefore should be dropped. Research on three-layered perceptrons showed how to implement such functions. Rosenblatt in his book proved that the elementary perceptron with a priori unlimited number of hidden layer A-elements (neurons) and one output neuron can solve any classification problem. (Existence theorem.Theorem 1 in Rosenblatt, F. (1961) Principles of Neurodynamics: Perceptrons and the Theory of Brain Mechanisms, Spartan. Washington DC.) Minsky and Papert used perceptrons with restricted number of inputs of the hidden layer A-elements and locality condition: each element of the hidden layer receives the input signals from a small circle. These restricted perceptrons cannot define whether the image is a connected figure or is the number of pixels in the image even (the parity predicate). There are many mistakes in this story. Although a single neuron can in fact compute only a small number of logical predicates, it was widely known that networks of such elements can compute any possible boolean function. This was known by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts, who even proposed how to create a Turing machine with their formal neurons, is mentioned in Rosenblatt's book, and is even mentioned in the book Perceptrons.Cf. Minsky-Papert (1972:232): \\"... a universal computer could be built entirely out of linear threshold modules. This does not in any sense reduce the theory of computation and programming to the theory of perceptrons.\\" Minsky also extensively uses formal neurons to create simple theoretical computers in his book Computation: Finite and Infinite Machines. What the book does prove is that in three-layered feed-forward perceptrons (with a so-called \\"hidden\\" or \\"intermediary\\" layer), it is not possible to compute some predicates unless at least one of the neurons in the first layer of neurons (the \\"intermediary\\" layer) is connected with a non-null weight to each and every input. This was contrary to a hope held by some researchers in relying mostly on networks with a few layers of \\"local\\" neurons, each one connected only to a small number of inputs. A feed-forward machine with \\"local\\" neurons is much easier to build and use than a larger, fully connected neural network, so researchers at the time concentrated on these instead of on more complicated models. Some other critics, most notably Jordan Pollack, note that what was a small proof concerning a global issue (parity) not being detectable by local detectors was interpreted by the community as a rather successful attempt to bury the whole idea.  Perceptrons and pattern recognition  In the final chapter, the authors put forth thoughts on multilayer machines and Gamba perceptrons. They conjecture that Gamba machines would require \\"an enormous number\\" of Gamba-masks and that multilayer neural nets are a \\"sterile\\" extension. Additionally, they note that many of the \\"impossible\\" problems for perceptrons had already been solved using other methods.  Reception and legacy  Perceptrons received a number of positive reviews in the years after publication. In 1969, Stanford professor Michael A. Arbib stated, \\"[t]his book has been widely hailed as an exciting new chapter in the theory of pattern recognition.\\" Earlier that year, CMU professor Allen Newell composed a review of the book for Science, opening the piece by declaring \\"[t]his is a great book.\\" On the other hand, H.D. Block expressed concern at the authors' narrow definition of perceptrons. He argued that they \\"study a severely limited class of machines from a viewpoint quite alien to Rosenblatt's\\", and thus the title of the book was \\"seriously misleading\\". Contemporary neural net researchers shared some of these objections: Bernard Widrow complained that the authors had defined perceptrons too narrowly, but also said that Minsky and Papert's proofs were \\"pretty much irrelevant\\", coming a full decade after Rosenblatt's perceptron. Perceptrons is often thought to have caused a decline in neural net research in the 1970s and early 1980s. During this period, neural net researchers continued smaller projects outside the mainstream, while symbolic AI research saw explosive growth. With the revival of connectionism in the late 80s, PDP researcher David Rumelhart and his colleagues returned to Perceptrons. In a 1986 report, they claimed to have overcome the problems presented by Minsky and Papert, and that \\"their pessimism about learning in multilayer machines was misplaced\\".  Analysis of the controversy  It is most instructive to learn what Minsky and Papert themselves said in the 1970s as to what was the broader implications of their book. On his website Harvey Cohen, a researcher at the MIT AI Labs 1974+, quotes Minsky and Papert in the 1971 Report of Project MAC, directed at funding agencies, on \\"Gamba networks\\":from the name of the italian neural network researcher Augusto Gamba (1923‚Äì1996), designer of the PAPA perceptron \\"Virtually nothing is known about the computational capabilities of this latter kind of machine. We believe that it can do little more than can a low order perceptron.\\" In the preceding page Minsky and Papert make clear that \\"Gamba networks\\" are networks with hidden layers. Minsky has compared the book to the fictional book Necronomicon in H. P. Lovecraft's tales, a book known to many, but read only by a few. The authors talk in the expanded edition about the criticism of the book that started in the 1980s, with a new wave of research symbolized by the PDP book. How Perceptrons was explored first by one group of scientists to drive research in AI in one direction, and then later by a new group in another direction, has been the subject of a sociological study of scientific development.

Origins and education Graham was born at Netherby, Cumberland, on 24 September 1648, the eldest son of Sir George Graham, 2nd Baronet (d. 1658), of Netherby, son and heir of Sir Richard Graham, 1st Baronet (d. 1654). His mother was Lady Mary Johnstone, second daughter of James Johnstone, 1st Earl of Hartfell. He was educated at Westminster School under Dr Busby, although not on the foundation. He proceeded to Christ Church, Oxford, about 1664. On 4 February 1666 he graduated Master of Arts. Rise to prominence Graham was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Cockermouth, Cumberland, on 8 June 1675, in the place of John Clarke, deceased, and continued to represent that borough in the parliaments of 1678-9, 1679, and 1680-1.History of Parliament Online - Graham, Sir Richard, 3rd Bt. Though a Protestant he zealously advocated the right of James, Duke of York, to the succession. Supported by other high Tories he moved in the Commons on behalf of the Duke against the Exclusion Bill, 2 November 1680. His exertions were rewarded by his being created a peer of Scotland by the title of Viscount Preston in the county of Haddington, and Baron Graham of Eske. The patent, which is dated at Windsor Castle on 12 May 1681, recites that Charles I in 1635 had given the warrant to Sir Richard Graham, the patentee's grandfather, and that it had afterwards been burnt by the rebels. In July 1681 Preston was in attendance on the Duke of York at Edinburgh; on 1 August he took his place in the Parliament of Scotland; and on 26 August was with the duke at Leith, where he made a speech about the succession. Diplomatic career In May 1682 he succeeded Henry Savile as envoy extraordinary to the court of France. His instructions included many relating to Orange and Luxembourg, and to the proposal to Charles II to be the mediator of a peace between France and Spain, and relating to French excesses in the Netherlands. In August he gave notice that a plot for a descent upon Ireland was being concocted in France against Charles, and he employed spies to collect information on the subject. The king was not much disturbed, and ordered one of Preston's spies out of his presence as a liar. In September Preston presented a strongly worded memorial to the French king 'touching his seizing upon the city of Orange, looking on it as done to himself‚Äô. In October 1683 the Earl of Sunderland by the king's commands gave Preston directions to let the ministers in France know 'what a very ill man Dr. Burnet was.' Preston obeyed these orders, but declined to receive a visit from Burnet. He was ordered to endeavour to trace out Bomeny, the valet to the Arthur Capell, 1st Earl of Essex, who was suspected of being privy to that nobleman's death in the Tower of London. For his attention to the privileges in France of the Scottish people he gained the thanks of the Scottish royal boroughs. In the beginning of 1684 he heard reports that he was to be recalled, but the king disavowed any such intention in a very cordial letter. Political career under James II Preston returned home at the accession of James II, and on 2 April 1685 was elected M.P. for Cumberland. He hoped to have been raised to the English peerage as Baron Liddell in Cumberland, but was disappointed on account of his adherence to his religion. In conjunction with Lord Middleton he was entrusted by James with the management of the House of Commons which met on 19 May, was sworn a member of the privy council on 21 October, and five days later became chancellor to the queen-dowager. In 1687 he was made Lord Lieutenant of Cumberland and Westmorland. At the end of October 1688 he was made northern Secretary and chosen Lord President of the Council in succession to the Earl of Sunderland, and was one of the council of five appointed by the king to represent him in London during his absence at Salisbury in November 1688. He vainly endeavoured to impress upon James the necessity of moderation. Jacobite conspirator After the revolution Preston, who was in high favour with Louis XIV, was entrusted by the French government with considerable sums of money for political purposes. In a gesture, which was also intended to be a test case, James II, created him, by letters patent dated at St. Germain-en- Laye 21 January 1689 Baron of Esk, in the Peerage of England, which title was not recognised subsequently by the House of Lords. In March 1689 he was reported to be in the north of England concerting measures for the restoration of the king. In May he was arrested, brought up to London, committed to the Tower, and not admitted to bail until 25 October. Meanwhile, the Earl of Montagu had commenced an action against him to recover the profits of the office of wardrobe, for which he held a life patent for the place. Preston thereupon appeared before the House of Lords on 11 November, claiming the privilege of a peer of the realm in respect of the action at law. He stated that he had received a patent to be an English Peer from James II before the vote of abdication passed. The house thereupon sent him to the Tower, and instructed the attorney-general to prosecute him for a high misdemeanor. He was, however, released on making a humble apology and withdrawing his claim, 27 November. On the following day, he obtained a discharge from his recognisances in the court of king's bench, no further notice being taken of his conduct in the north. On 28 June 1690 Lord Montagu won his action, being awarded ¬£1,300 damages. Preston carried on his plots, and was still regarded by his party as a man of courage and honour. He retained the seals of his office, and was still considered by the Jacobites as the real secretary of state. The lord president, Carmarthen, caused a watch to be set on his movements. In December 1690 a meeting of the leading Protestant Jacobites was held, at which it was determined that Preston should carry to St. Germain the resolutions of the conspirators. Arrest, trial and pardon Nunnington Hall, Yorkshire Soon after midnight on 1 January 1691 Preston, Major Edmund Elliott, and John Ashton were seized as they lay concealed in the hatches of a smack making for Calais or Dunkirk. A packet of treasonable papers, tied together and weighted in order to be sunk in case of surprise, was dropped by Preston with his official seals, and seized upon the person of Ashton, who had tried to conceal it. The prisoners vainly attempted to bribe their captors. On 3 January Preston was sent to the Tower, and on the 16th was indicted at the Old Bailey in the name of Sir Richard Graham for high treason. He pleaded that as a peer of England he was not within the jurisdiction of the court, but this plea being overruled, he was on 17 January found guilty, and condemned to death two days afterwards. His estate and title of baronet were forfeited to the crown. Some months passed before his fate was decided. Lady Preston, on petitioning the queen for her husband's life, received an intimation that he could save himself by making a full discovery of the plot. During some time he regularly wrote, it is said, a confession every forenoon, and burned it every night when he had dined. At last he confessed his guilt, and named Clarendon, Dartmouth, Francis Turner, Bishop of Ely, and William Penn as his accomplices. He added a long list of persons against whom he could not himself give evidence, but who, if he could trust to Penn's assurances, were friendly to King James. After several respites, the government, convinced that he could tell even more, again fixed a day for his execution. At length, on 1 May, he made a further confession, and gained thereby another reprieve of three weeks, 'which, 'tis believed,' writes Luttrell, 'will end in a pardon‚Äô. A patent was passed for his pardon soon afterwards, and on 13 June he obtained his release. His estate was, however, still retained by the crown as security for his good behaviour, a supposed equivalent being granted him from the exchequer. Subsequently, in September 1693, the queen granted ¬£600 a year from the forfeited estate to Lady Preston and her children. The attainder could not affect his Scottish peerage, as no act of forfeiture against him passed in Scotland. Early in August 1691 Preston was recommitted to Newgate Prison for refusing to give evidence against some 'criminals,' but was soon bailed out. Thereafter he was permitted to retire to Nunnington Hall in Yorkshire, which he had inherited from his great-uncle, pursued by the execrations of his party. Translator of Boethius Preston employed the remainder of his life in revising for the press a translation with notes of Boethius's De Consolatione Philosophiae which he had made in 1680. It was published after his death at London in 1695-1696, and is remarkable on account of the allusions with which the preface is filled. In figurative language the translator complained that his judges had been more lenient than the friends who had sneered at him for giving way under trials which they had never undergone. Death and posterity Preston died at Nunnington Hall on 22 December 1695, and was buried in the chancel of the church. He married, on 2 August 1670, Lady Anne Howard, second daughter of Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Carlisle, by whom he had with other issue a son, Edward (1679-1709), who succeeded him as second Viscount Preston. He also had two daughters, Catherine (1677‚Äì1757), who married William Widdrington, 4th Baron Widdrington, and Mary (died unmarried in 1753). They inherited the Nunnington estate in 1739 on the death of their nephew Charles (1706‚Äì1739), the third Viscount Preston, who had died without offspring.

The line branches from the main North East railway at Benalla station and runs across the Victoria- New South Wales border to the town of Oaklands, New South Wales. History The first section of line opened in 1883 as a branch line to St James, at the same time as the extension of the main line to Albury in New South Wales. In 1886, the line was extended another to Yarrawonga, on the southern bank of the Murray River, which formed the colonial and, later, the state boundary between Victoria and New South Wales. Under the 1922 Border Railways Act, the line was extended another 61 kilometres to Oaklands, New South Wales, where it met the existing New South Wales branch line, thereby becoming a break-of-gauge location. Although the construction of the extension was completed in 1932, trains on it were operated by the Railway Construction Branch, mostly using a rail tractor as motive power, until the line was formally handed over to the Victorian Railways in August 1938. There was no turntable at the terminus, so steam locomotives had to operate tender-first when running to Oaklands. During World War II, additional sidings of both Victorian broad gauge and NSW standard gauge were provided, to serve Australian defence installations which were located at Oaklands. There was no passenger service to Oaklands at first but, in December 1946, a twice-weekly service began, operated by a rail motor. That service had been discontinued by the early 1950s. The last regular passenger service on the line was between Benalla and Yarrawonga on 13 October 1979, operated by DERM 55RM. With the opening of the North East standard gauge line in 1961, the line had standard gauge track at both ends, in addition to the broad gauge via Benalla. Gauge conversion of the line was proposed at various times, including by the Victorian State Government in 2001 with a proposed completion data of late 2003. The last broad gauge train to run on the line was a Pacific National grain service in May 2007. In 2008, agreement was reached to convert the North East railway line from broad gauge to standard gauge, which would have left the Oaklands branch as an isolated and useless spur. The local MP reported that the cost of converting this branch to standard gauge was just over $13m.Ken Jasper MLA, Member for Murray Valley - Jasper supports Oaklands rail line upgrade In October 2008 the Victorian State Government announced that an upgrade would take place. The conversion was completed in December 2009, at a cost of $16.5 million, with nearly 50,000 sleepers replaced. The first revenue service on the converted line was an El Zorro grain train on 10 March. Traffic The line carries seasonal grain traffic. There is no passenger service. In the 2000s, a potential new source of traffic on the line was noted, with the opening of coal mines in the area. At the time, the Coalworks company, since taken over by Whitehaven Coal, estimated that it had thermal coal reserves of at Oaklands.

Predating the launch of the originally similar ESPNews by three years, it focused on 24-hour coverage of sports news and analysis. History NewSport debuted on October 1, 1993, replacing SportsChannel America, a national version spun off of Rainbow's SportsChannel regional sports network group. NewSport developed a unique sports ticker, known as the \\"NewSport Score Box\\", which debuted in 1995 and provided constantly updated score information on ongoing games and schedules for upcoming sports events at the bottom right of the screen. The network also aired original programs such as NewSport Talk (a sports discussion program), NewSport Journal, NewSport Tonite (a nightly program featuring news and analysis on the day in sports) and Scoreboard Central (which premiered on April 29, 1995, a 12-hour sports news program that aired on Saturdays and Sundays from 12:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. Eastern Time). Programming from the network was used as filler on Rainbow's regional SportsChannel networks and PRISM (a Philadelphia-area movies/sports pay service also owned by Rainbow); some over-the-air television stations, like WYLN-CD, also carried NewSport programming. The network was slow to grow in coverage, with relatively limited carriage on cable system operators besides Cablevision, owner of SportsChannel and NewSport parent Rainbow Media. Ironically, even Cablevision did not give the network full-time coverage as it carried NewSport on the channel slots also occupied by The Weather Channel on some of their systems through a time- share arrangement. At its peak, NewSport had only about 10 million subscribers nationwide. This slow growth and lack of viewers, combined with the wide distribution and success of ESPNEWS and Rainbow reportedly losing more than $20 million operating the network, resulted in Rainbow Programming Holdings deciding to shut down NewSport on July 9, 1997. American Sports Classics American Sports Classics (named after then-sister network American Movie Classics) was a network that focused on sports nostalgia programming; it was originally set to launch after NewSport ceased operations on July 9, 1997, however its launch was postponed \\"indefinitely\\" for a time, after Rainbow Media transferred control of the network to Fox/Liberty Networks, a joint venture between News Corporation, Liberty Media and Cablevision created after News Corporation acquired a 40% stake in Cablevision's sports properties for $850 million in June 1997. When it launched that fall, the network featured a broad mix of biographical and magazine-style programs. ASC's format contrasted with the similarly focused Classic Sports Network (which later became ESPN Classic), which at the time mostly showed archived sports event telecasts. Indeed, the reason why the launch was postponed in the first place was due to problems Rainbow faced in trying to obtain the rebroadcast rights to sporting events from the major professional and collegiate sports leagues or their broadcast partners, forcing American Sports Classics to rely on the magazine and biographical programs. Like NewSport, ASC was unable to stand up to its competitors, specifically Classic Sports Network. The network ceased operations in mid-1998, shortly after SportsChannel discontinued operations upon its merger with Fox Sports Net.

It could mean (vice versa) a recourse to the ecclesiastical forum against the usurpation by the civil forum of the rights of ecclesiastical jurisdiction. Thus defined, the \\"appeal as from an abuse\\" had as its object was to safeguard equally the rights both of the State and of the Church. An abuse would be an act on either hand, without due authority, beyond the limits of their respective ordinary and natural jurisdictions. In practice the use of such appeals was important, historically, as a way to undermine the power of church courts. Canon law The canonscan. \\"Dilecto\\", in bk. VI of Decretals, \\"De sent. excom.\\", in ch. vi. did not exclude a recourse to the civil authority when the acts of an ecclesiastical judge invaded the domain of the civil authority, especially as reciprocity gave the ecclesiastical authority the right to repel with the same weapons any usurpation by the lay judge to the damage of the rights of the Church. Thus also a recourse to the supreme civil ruler was not deemed amiss when an ecclesiastical court undertook a cause belonging to the competency of a higher ecclesiastical court, and the ruler was askedcan. \\"Placuit\\" in Decree of Gratian, Pt. II, Q. I, ch. xi. merely to forward it to the proper tribunal without, however, claiming to delegate to it any jurisdiction. Perhaps the first formal manifestation of this appeal in the legitimate sense occurred in the fourteenth century. History Ecclesiastical judges acquired a reputation for learning and equity, and by the good will of the State, not merely ecclesiastical, but many civil cases of the laity were adjudicated by them. in 1329 complaint was brought to King Philip de Valois by the advocate general, Peter de Cugni√®res, that the civil tribunals were fast lapsing into contempt, and were being abandoned. The purport of the complaint was to restrict the competency of the ecclesiastical tribunals to their own legitimate fields. Bickerings between the two forums were henceforth frequent. Even the Catholic states, after the beginning of the sixteenth century, advanced far in the way of frequent ruptures with the Church. When the Protestant states had acquired control and supervision over the newly reformed bodies even in their spiritual relations, the Catholic states, particularly France, strove to limit the jurisdiction of the Church as far as they could without casting aside the profession of the Catholic Faith. The Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges was a serious aggression by France upon the acknowledged rights of the Church and of the Holy See. It is in France that we find the most flagrant series of encroachments upon Church jurisdiction, through pretence of appeals as from an abuse, gradually tending to the elimination of the ecclesiastical forum. During the seventeenth century the French clergy presented frequent memorials against the encroachments made by their kings and parliaments through constant recourse to these \\"appeals as from an abuse\\", which resulted in submitting to civil tribunals questions of definitions of faith, the proper administration of the sacraments, and the like. This brought confusion into the regulation of spiritual matters by encouraging ecclesiastics to rebel against their lawful ecclesiastical superiors. The lay tribunals undertook to adjudicate whether the ministers of the sacraments had a right to refuse them to those deemed unworthy, or the right to Christian burial of Catholics dying impenitent or under Church censures; whether interdicts or suspensions were valid; whether monastic professions should be annulled; whether the bishop's permission was necessary for preaching; whether a specified marriage was contrary or not to the Gospel; and also to decide the justice of canonical privations of benefices. Many other subjects intimately connected with the teaching of the Church were brought before lay tribunals, and unappealable decisions rendered in open contradiction to the canons, as can easily be surmised both from the absence of theological knowledge, and from the visible animus shown in decisions that undertook to subject the spiritual power of the Church to the dictates of transient politics. Interference was mostly owing to courtier-canonists who flattered the secular rulers by dwelling upon the right of protection over the Church conceded in early days to the Christian Roman Emperors. The Church was recognized as autonomous in all things of the divine law and in matters of ecclesiastical discipline. When rulers like Charlemagne seemed to take upon themselves undue authority, insisting upon certain canons, the bishops claimed their sole right to govern the Church. Even in mixed assemblies of bishops and nobles and princes, the bishops insisted that the civil power should not encroach upon the rights of the Church, e. g. in the Council of Narbonne (788). ZaccariaDissertaz. 28 recognized, however, that in his day (the eighteenth century), as well as in former ages, the Catholic rulers of Catholic States, in their quality of protectors of the Church, might receive a recourse from ecclesiastics in ecclesiastical matters, in order that justice might be done them by their ordinary ecclesiastical judges, not as deputies of the civil rulers, but as ordinary judges in their own forum. In her concordats with Catholic states the Catholic Church granted to several that the civil cases of clerics, and such as concern the property and temporal rights of churches, as well as benefices and other ecclesiastical foundations, may be brought before the civil courts. Modern relationship All ecclesiastical causes, and those that concern the Faith, sacraments, morals, sacred functions, and rights connected with the sacred ministry, belong to the ecclesiastical forum, both in regard of persons and of matter.cf. Concordat with Ecuador in 1881. In the United States, as decreed by the Third Provincial Council of Baltimore (1837), the church law is that if any ecclesiastical person or member of a religious body, male or female, should cite an ecclesiastic or a religious before a civil court on a question of a purely ecclesiastical nature, he should know that he falls under the censures decreed by canon law. The Congregation of Propaganda in its comment explained that, in mixed cases, where the persons may be ecclesiastical, but the things about which there is question may be temporal or of one's household, this rule cannot be enforced, especially in countries in which the civil government is not in the hands of Catholics, and where, unless recourse is had to the civil courts, there is not the means or the power of enforcing an ecclesiastical decision for the protection or recovery of one's own. A special proviso was made by Propaganda for the United States,17 August 1886. that if a priest should bring a cleric before a civil tribunal on an ecclesiastical or other question without permission from the bishop he could be forced to withdraw the case by the infliction of penalties and censures, yet the bishop must not refuse the permission if the parties have ineffectually attempted a settlement before him. If the bishop is to be cited, the permission of the Holy See is required. By a special declaration of Propaganda,6 September 1886. a cleric's transfer of a claim to a layman for the purpose of evading the censures is checked by the requirement of the consent of the bishop to such transfer, if made for the purpose of the suit. Justice Redfieldin vol. XV, Am. Law Reg., p. 277, quoted with approval in vol. XCVIII of Penn. Rep., p. 213. says in reference to the United States generally: \\"The decision of ecclesiastical courts or officers having, by the rules or laws of the bodies to which they belong, jurisdiction of such questions, or the right to decide them, will be held conclusive in all courts of the civil administration, and no question involved in such decisions will be revised or reviewed in the civil courts, except those pertaining to the jurisdiction of such courts or officers to determine such questions according to the laws or the usage of the bodies they represent.\\" Justice Strong, of the Supreme Court of the United States,In his lecture on the \\"Relations of Civil Law to Church Policy\\" (p. 41). speaks of the Church as \\"an interior organization within a religious society\\", and adds,p. 42. \\"I think it may be safely asserted as a general principle that whenever questions of discipline, of faith, of Church rule, of membership, or of office, have been decided by the Church, in its own modes of decision, civil law tribunals accept these decisions as final and apply them as made.\\" Notes References ;Attribution * The entry cites: **Zaccaria, Dissertazioni di storia ecclesiastica (Rome, 1841); **Affre, Trait√© des appels comme d'abus (Paris, 1844); **Nussi, Conventiones inter S.

Location Due to its good strategic location, the castle controlled the narrow Mura valley north of Graz, which opens out into the Graz basin, and therefore the traffic and trade to and from Graz. The castle ruin, which is above Graz, is a popular place to visit, since it offers a panoramic view of the Graz basin and the eastern Styrian hill country even today. History The castle was built in the 11th century; the first record dates to the year 1042. It continued to be extended until the 15th century. In that century, the castle was expanded to a fortress to provide protection against the Turks and Hungarians. It was part of the signalling fire system, which was supposed to warn the population in case of danger. In 1707, the castle and domain were acquired by the Counts of Attems. On 10 July 1723 lightning struck the gunpowder magazine and a large part of the castle burnt down. It was not rebuilt, but was replaced as the new residence of the Attems family by the Baroque Schloss G√∂sting or Neug√∂sting at the foot of the mountain, which was completed in 1728. Since 1999 the ruin and surrounding forests have been owned by the Auer family, who are bakers.Land register of the district court Graz The ruin is maintained by the castle foundation, which was founded in 1925. Construction Today only the chapel, the keep, and the remains of some of the walls are still standing. The tower now houses a small museum, and a tavern has been established. The castle can be reached on foot in only 30 minutes from the Schlossplatz in G√∂sting.

Some years later, when a UK-based auto manufacturer wished to name a new model as Standard Vanguard, Tyndale- Biscoe was involved in the decision as to whether they should be permitted to do so. Biography Alec Julian Tyndale-Biscoe was born at North Petherton (Bridgwater, Somerset) in the southwest of England, the elder of the two recorded sons of Lt. Col. Arthur Annesley Tyndale-Biscoe (1872 ‚Äì 1969) by his marriage two years earlier to Emily Beatrice Duff (1883 ‚Äì 1976). Tyndale- Biscoe was a great grandson of Captain George Duff (1764 ‚Äì 1805), through his mother's family. He was educated at the Royal Naval Colleges, Osborne and Dartmouth and entered the British Royal Navy in 1920. Specialising as a naval engineer, he served in the navy during and after the Second World War, rising to the rank of captain in 1949 and ending his professional career as a \\"rear admiral\\".

As usually understood, they are moral and ecclesiastical, broad in character and limited in number. In modern times there are five. These specifically Catholic commandments flow from and lead to the Ten Commandments which are common to all the Abrahamic religions. In particular Catechism of the Catholic Church The Catechism of the Catholic Church promulgates the following:https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c3a3.htm > # You shall attend Mass on Sundays and holy days of obligation. # You shall > confess your sins at least once a year. # You shall humbly receive your > Creator in Holy Communion at least during the Easter season. # You shall > observe the prescribed days of fasting and abstinence. # You shall help to > provide for the needs of the Church. Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church The Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church enumerates the same five:Vatican.Va: Compendium of the Catechism Q. 432 > # to attend Mass on Sundays and other holy days of obligation and to refrain > from work and activities which could impede the sanctification of those > days; # to confess one's sins, receiving the sacrament of Reconciliation at > least once each year; # to receive the sacrament of the Eucharist at least > during the Easter season; # to abstain from eating meat and to observe the > days of fasting established by the Church. # to help to provide for the > material needs of the Church, each according to his own ability. The fourth Church Commandment is commonly remembered as abstinence from meat (but not fish) on Fridays (except solemnities), and abstinence-plus restriction to one meal only on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday. The details are quite various, including some countries to allow for a different way of penance on at least ordinary Fridays. The whole of Lent is of penitential character,Paul VI, Paenitemini II 1 though no specified practice is required. Reasons The first reason for the Church commandments is Christ's ability to liberate through his prescriptions for humanity.http://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul- ii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_14091998_fides-et-ratio.html, Jn 14:15; 10:10 Secondly, Church authority, which has a right to be obeyed as delegated by Jesus,\\"Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\\" Matt 16:19b RSV; \\"He that heareth you, heareth me.\\" Lk 10:16 which common tradition subsumes under the Fourth Commandment. The first Church Commandment is obviously an explanation of the minimum requirements for hallowing the Lord's Day, with the specification that it is Mass, and not anything else, that needs to be heard, that the Lord's Day has been shifted from Saturday to Sunday, and that some other feasts are assigned by Church authority in remembrance of Our Lord, of His blessed Mother and of the Saints. The third Church Commandment is a specification to Our Lord's directive to eat His Flesh,John 5:53 reducible to the Third Commandment as well since it is an act of devotion. The second Church Commandment prescribes a preparation for fulfilling the third Church Commandment and was promulgated at the Fourth Council of the Lateran.Technically, he is not bound to confess who has not sinned mortally. Can 989. Previously, theologians have opined that their duty to confess ‚Äútheir sins‚Äù is indeed restricted to mortal sins, but if they have none, they are bound to declare just that in the confessional. St. Thomas Supp. 6 III ad 3, who however also mentions the other opinion, safer then and, anyway and now as well, the better alternative anyway in a spiritual way, that such persons at least should confess some of their venial sins. What concerns the fourth Church Commandment, the Church believes that penancePaenitemini I 1 is of divine law, and the notion is general that fasting, as a penitential practise, is quite useful,St. Thomas, II/II 147 I and III citing such Scripture as \\"Be converted to Me with all your heart, in fasting\\".Joel 2:12, Douay-Rheims Bible Thus again, the commanding act of the Church rather consists in the precisation. The necessity of providing for the needs of the Church results from the faithful belonging to one Mystical Body and is regulated in canons 1260 and 1262.According to Can. 1263, a compulsory church tax may be imposed to natural persons only in extraordinary circumstances, except in countries where this is particular custom. The Church commandments are generally seen as ‚Äúminimum requirements‚Äù for leading a Christian life in Communion with the Catholic Church. History As early as the time of Constantine I, especial insistence was put upon the obligation to hear Mass on Sundays and Holy Days, to receive the sacraments and to abstain from contracting marriage at certain seasons. In the seventh-century Penitentiary of Theodore of Canterbury we find penalties imposed on those who contemn the Sunday. According to a work written by Regino, Abbot of Pr√ºm (d. 915), entitled \\"Libri duo de synodalibus causis et disciplinis\\", the bishop in his visitation is, among other inquiries, to ask :if anyone has not kept the fast of Lent, or of the ember-days, or of the rogations, or that which may have been appointed by the bishop for the staying of any plague; if there by any one who has not gone to Holy Communion three time in the year, that is at Easter, Pentecost and Christmas; if there by any one who has withheld tithes from God and His saints; if there by anyone so perverse and so alienated from God as not to come to Church at least on Sundays; if there be anyone who has not gone to confession once in the year, that is at the beginning of Lent, and has not done penance for his sins (Hafner, Zur Geschichte der Kirchengebote, in Theologische Quartalschrift, LXXX, 104). The precepts here implied came to be regarded as special Commandments of the Church. Thus in a book of tracts of the thirteenth century attributed to Pope Celestine V (though the authenticity of this work has been denied) a separate tractate is given to the precepts of the Church and is divided into four chapters, the first of which treats of fasting, the second of confession and paschal Communion, the third of interdicts on marriage, and the fourth of tithes. In the fourteenth century Ernest von Parduvitz, Archbishop of Prague, instructed his priests to explain in popular sermons the principal points of the catechism, the Our Father, the Creed, the Commandments of God and of the Church (Hafner, loc. cit., 115). A century later (1470) the catechism of Dietrick Coelde, the first, it is said, to be written in German, explicitly set forth that there were five Commandments of the Church. In his \\"Summa Theologica\\" (part I, tit. xvii, p. 12) Antoninus of Florence (1439) enumerates ten precepts of the Church universally binding on the faithful. These are: *to observe certain feasts *to keep the prescribed fasts *to attend Mass on Sundays and Holy Days *to confess once a year *to receive Holy Communion during paschal time *to pay tithes *to abstain from any act upon which an interdict has been placed entailing excommunication *to refrain also from any act interdicted under pain of excommunication lat√¶ sententi√¶ *to avoid association with the excommunicated *finally, not to attend Mass or other religious functions celebrated by a priest living in open concubinage. In the sixteenth century Martin Aspilcueta(1586), gives a list of four principal precepts of obligation: *to fast at certain prescribed times *to pay tithes *to go to confession once a year *and to receive Holy Communion at Easter (Enchiridion, sive manuale confessariorum et poenitentium, Rome, 1588, ch. xxi, n. 1). At this time there began to appear many popular works in defence of the authority of the Church and setting forth her precepts. Such among others were the \\"Summa Doctrin√¶ Christian√¶\\" (1555) of Peter Canisius and the \\"Doctrina Christiana\\" of Bellarmine (1589).

Before the case was decided, the Equality Act 2010 provided a remedy to protect political beliefs, though it had not come into effect when this case was brought forth. Facts Arthur Redfearn was a bus driver for Serco Ltd, trading as West Yorkshire Transport Service, for Bradford City Council. He was disabled and drove a bus for disabled people. He had been rated as a first class employee by his Asian supervisor. But then he was elected as councillor for Bradford, representing the far right British National Party. The union had words with Serco, who said that on \\"health and safety\\" grounds he would be made redundant. The alleged idea was that in an area with large ethnic minority populations, his profile would make him a target for violent attacks, and that could make for an unsafe bus service. Redfearn alleged that he was being directly racially discriminated against under s 1(1)(a) of the Race Relations Act 1976, 'on racial grounds'. In previous cases, it had been held that this phrase should be construed widely. He said that where a person was subject to a detriment (here a dismissal) for a reason which involved race, that amounted to discrimination contrary to the Act Redfearn lost at the Employment Tribunal, but succeeded at the Employment Appeal Tribunal, and Serco appealed to the Court of Appeal. Judgment Court of Appeal Mummery LJ held that the purpose of the race discrimination rules was to combat the state of mind that breeds intolerance, not protect it. The indirect discrimination claim was held to fail on the technical point of pleading. He pointed out the Tribunal had suggested a 'provision, criterion or practice' that would be complained of was banning anyone with BNP membership. But that was wrong, because there could be no non-white comparator, because only whites were allowed in. Mummery LJ said,[2006] EWCA Civ 659, [53-54] Therefore, it was unnecessary to consider a 'health and safety' justification, but if it had been considered, as the Tribunal did, then more scrutiny was probably needed.[2006] EWCA Civ 659, [55]-[56] Furthermore, there was no human rights claim for Redfearn. David Pannick QC, acting for Serco Ltd submitted correctly that Art 17 of the European Convention on Human Rights states that nothing in the Convention should allow rights for any group to engage in activity aimed at destroying Convention rights. Dyson LJ and Sir Martin Nourse agreed. Mr Redfearn applied to the European Court of Human Rights, alleging the decision violated his right to freedom of association, private life, and that he had been unequally treated. European Court of Human Rights The European Court of Human Rights held that Mr Redfearn's right to freedom of association has been infringed and violated, because the qualifying period of one year for unfair dismissal left no room for a claim that he was discriminated against on grounds of his political beliefs. Three judges dissented. Significance The effect of the Court of Appeal decision appeared to be that any employer may pursue a workplace equality policy that results in refusal to hire staff who belong to political or religious groups whose aim is to undermine the fundamental rights set forth in the ECHR. However, the European Court of Human Rights decision casts doubt on any ability to simply dismiss a person because of their political beliefs. In particular, the use of a qualifying period for the ERA 1996 right to dismiss a person was held to be inadequate. A proposal to remedy this was put forward by the Government in the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill. This provision is now contained as an automatically unfair reason for dismissal in the ERA 1996, and does not require compliance with a qualifying period to be asserted. On the contrary, the affected worker may bring a claim since the first day of employment if there was a dismissal on these grounds.

In 2009-2010 a cause of delay to air the series in the U.S and Canada due to international distribution of the series forgoing to be aired in 2009-2010. Plot Beatriz Pengson, or simply Betty, is an aesthetically challenged career-oriented girl who happens to work in a posh advertising agency known as Ecomoda Manila. In an industry where everyone thrives on beauty and perfection, her lack of good looks and outdated sense of fashion make her an instant outcast amongst her superficial colleagues. Despite her shortcomings, Betty's capabilities and innate kindheartedness have gained her a set of loyal friends. Betty's lackluster life, however, heads a turn for the better (or is it for worse?) when she meets the man of her dreams, Armando Solis, the President of Ecomoda Manila. How will Betty catch the elusive heart of someone who's way out of her league? Is it possible that a good-looking guy like Armando will eventually fall in love with a certified ugly duckling? Cast and characters  Main cast  *Bea Alonzo as Herself / Beatrice \\"Betty\\" Pengson; in reality Beatrice Tingson (Beatriz Aurora \\"Betty\\" Pinz√≥n Solano) - Her intellectual capabilities and excellent organizational skills make her the perfect secretary for any top brass executive. The problem lies in her odd appearance which has always been a butt of jokes amongst her officemates. Yet not even such harsh treatment can deter her from achieving her goals and from being a nice girl towards other people. *John Lloyd Cruz as Armando Solis (Armando Mendoza S√°enz) - He is the epitome of a sophisticated and adventurous bachelor who remains a certified ladies‚Äô man despite his soon-to-be-married status with his possessive girlfriend, Marcella. But the truth is that Armando has no choice but to give in to all her demands because their families are co-founders and owners of the company where he works for as the President. *Vhong Navarro as Nicholas \\"Kulas\\" Mora (Nicolas Mora) - One can easily single him out in a crowd because of his attention-getting nerdy fashion sense: high-waist pants, checkered polo shirt, and suspenders. Coupled with his weird personality, Nicholas is indeed the exact male counterpart of his best friend Betty La Fea. It is his fervent wish to win the heart of his dream girl Patricia. *Ai Ai delas Alas as Julia Pengson; in reality Julia Tingson (Julia Solano Galindo de Pinz√≥n) - She plans to work as a domestic helper in London to provide a better life for her family. But her children eventually persuade her to stay especially when Betty gets her first job in Eco Moda. *Ruffa Gutierrez as Daniella Valencia (Solis) (gender-swapped Marcela/Daniel Valencia/Wilhelmina Slater) - She is the main antagonist of the series. As the SVP of the ad agency co-owned by her family with the Solis, it is her job to make sure that everything is under control in Eco Moda Manila. Her distrust towards Armando's capabilities, however, often creates a rift between them. Knowing that he's the fianc√© of her younger sister only intensifies her belief that he's nothing but a first-class gigolo. Eventually in the series, it became clear that her motives are mainly of revenge. *Megan Young as Marcella Valencia (Marcela Valencia) - For someone who's born with a silver spoon on her mouth, Marcella is used to getting everything she wants. As a result, her boyfriend suffers the most because of her domineering attitude similar to that of Daniella. Since she's aware of his womanizing ways, she keeps him under her beck and call at all times. *Ronaldo Valdez as Hermes Pengson; in reality Herminio \\"Miniong\\" Tingson (Hermes Pinz√≥n Galarza) - As a father, he believes that his daughter can be whoever she wants to be because she's an intelligent young lady. He is also very protective of Betty when it comes to ‚Äúpotential suitors‚Äù like Nicholas or Armando. *Sam Concepcion as Andrew Pengson; in reality Andrew Tingson (original character with some resemblance to Justin Suarez from Ugly Betty) - At first glance, you'd think that he's just a happy-go-lucky kid who's only out for some fun and excitement. But in truth, he's a loving son who always wants the best for the Pengson family. *Wendy Valdez as Patricia Suarez (Patricia Fern√°ndez de Brickman) - A rival secretary of Betty, she always creates mean and comedic schemes to get rid of her. Patricia is very attractive and sexy on the outside, but is shown to be shallow and an air-head. She wears flamboyant clothes and openly flaunts how proud she is of her beauty. *Joem Bascon as Mario Collantes (Mario Calder√≥n) - Despite his bad influence towards Armando when it comes to women, he nevertheless remains a loyal best friend to him. As the VP for Creatives, he closely works with Hugo and Randy for their various events and ad campaigns. Patricia is quite attracted to him, but he ignores her advances. *Thou Reyes as Hugo Bosinio (Hugo Lombardi) - Because he is a creative genius, he gets away with his annoying sarcasm when talking to the bigwigs including Armando's father, Roberto. He's a perfectionist who always wants the best out of every ad campaign that he makes. Yet despite his aversion to ugly people like Betty, he can also be nice when he wants to.

Production It had originally been reported that the Philippine version of \\"Yo soy Betty, La Fea\\" was going to be called \\"Betty Na Mas Pangit\\" (The Uglier Betty), but eventually the title was revealed to be \\"I Love Betty La Fea\\" instead. The series was set to debut in September 2008 with Bea Alonzo in the lead role. Early reports claimed that this Betty will be fatter and uglier than the other versions, and the story might be a mix of elements from the various other international adaptations. The official announcement of Alonzo's hiring ended a long period of casting speculation, during which actress/singer/TV host Toni Gonzaga and her frequent co-star Sam Milby were mentioned for the lead roles of Betty and Armando. Before Gonzaga's name was attached, it had previously been reported that Regine Velasquez wanted to leave the GMA Network to star in a reported musical adaptation of \\"Betty la fea\\" for rival network ABS-CBN, who bought the Philippine rights to the Colombian telenovela. Ultimately, though, she chose to stay with GMA Network, so the lead part was put up for grabs again. After Velasquez chose to stay with GMA Network, the names of a handful of ABS-CBN stars were then mentioned for the plum role, including Valerie Concepcion, Mariel Rodriguez, Bianca Gonzalez, Anne Curtis, Toni Gonzaga, and Bea Alonzo. People in the know insisted that the plum part would most likely go to Anne Curtis, who had plenty of practice playing the Ugly Duckling in \\"Kampanerang Kuba\\", as a reward for not moving back to GMA-7, but Gonzaga supposedly ended up winning the coveted role. The false news of Gonzaga and Milby's casting was probably derived from descriptions of their upcoming movie, My Big Love, in which Milby wears a fat suit and Gonzaga's character falls in love with him unconditionally, despite his appearance. After the role of Betty was cast, inquiring minds once again focused on who would play the male lead role. Fans speculated that the part would go to Jon Avila, Luis Manzano, Piolo Pascual, Jake Cuenca, Aga Muhlach, or Bea Alonzo's frequent co-star, John Lloyd Cruz, who led all online polls as the Armando of choice for a large majority of fans. On Monday, June 30, 2008, ABS-CBN aired a teaser music video (to the tune of Mika's \\"Hey Betty, You are Beautiful\\", which was originally recorded for the U.S. version, \\"Ugly Betty\\") during a primetime telenovela called \\"My Girl\\". The video introduced Betty and some of the show's other characters, such as Armando's business rival, Daniella (Ruffa Gutierrez); Betty's childhood friend, Nicolas (Vhong Navarro); Betty's doting parents, Julia (Ai Ai delas Alas) and Hermes (Ronaldo Valdez); Betty's little brother, Andrew (Sam Concepcion); and about a dozen others. The only notable character missing from the clip was the male lead himself, Armando, who still had not been cast at the time the teaser aired. Ironically, the clip was introduced by Toni Gonzaga, who had been a top contender for the role of Betty. Apparently, the early reports that this Betty would be fatter and uglier than other Bettys were false. Not only Betty is not fat, she is not particularly ugly either. In this version, the workplace is not a fashion house or a glossy magazine, but an advertising agency called Ecomoda Manila, or EM. In early August 2008, the internet rumor mill was naming Piolo Pascual as the show's Armando. When questioned about the casting rumors, Pascual only said that in deference to the producers' desire for secrecy, he could not comment on the matter. Like many of the previous casting rumors, this one was shortly proven to be false when it was finally revealed, with much fanfare on August 17, that Bea Alonzo would once again be reunited with her regular romantic male lead, John Lloyd Cruz, much to the relief and delight of the staunch fans of this popular pairing. It was the top show when May Bukas Pa and Tayong Dalawa has not been aired. Later, it had been in a very strong second place. The Bettyful Finale The final episode, which aired last April 24, 2009, got 41.3% in National TV Ratings conducted by TNS Media Research making the number one TV show on that day. This is the only version of the Betty franchise where Betty never had a make over. In this version, she decided to embrace her inner beauty instead of trying to be beautiful.

In some cases, only small amounts of a comonomer are employed, in other cases substantial amounts of comonomers are used. Furthermore, in some cases, the comonomers are statistically incorporated within the polymer chain, whereas in other cases, they aggregate. The distribution of comonomers is referred to as the \\"blockiness\\" of a copolymer. 1-Octene, 1-hexene, and 1-butene are used comonomers in the manufacture of polyethylenes. The advantages to such copolymers has led to a focus on catalysts that facilitate the incorporation of these comonomers, e.g., constrained geometry complexes. In this conversion, 1-hexene (red) is a comonomer in the formation of a modified polyethylene. Comonomers are often employed to improve the plastification of polymeric materials, i.e. the flexibility of the polymer. Unlike traditional plasticizers, comonomers are not leachable. In other cases, comonomers are used to introduce crosslinking. Divinylbenzene, for example, when copolymerized with styrene, gives a crosslinked polystyrene.Hans-Georg Elias \\"Plastics, General Survey\\"in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.

Bolger (born 25 December 1941) is a thoroughbred racehorse trainer and breeder based in Coolcullen in County Kilkenny. For many years, he has been recognised as one of the racing greats in Ireland. Aidan O'Brien, Tony McCoy and Paul Carberry were all apprenticed to him before gaining professional recognition in their own right. During the 2006 flat season, Bolger trained Teofilo to go unbeaten at the age of two. This five-race unbeaten streak included victories in the Group 1 National Stakes and Dewhurst Stakes. Talk of an English Triple Crown bid was imminent, but Teofilo suffered a career-ending injury in the lead up to the 2,000 Guineas and never saw a racecourse again. Bolger was criticized for his handling of this situation. 2007 saw another Bolger-bred star emerge in the shape of New Approach. He followed the same path as Teofilo during his two-year-old career and was unbeaten. In 2008, Bolger informed the public that New Approach would go to Newmarket for the Guineas followed by a trip to the Curragh for the Irish 2,000 Guineas and then on for a tilt at the Irish Derby. New Approach finished second in both Guineas, however, behind the Ballydoyle trained Henrythenavigator. It then emerged that at the latest Epsom Derby forfeit stage, New Approach's name had been left in by mistake. A week later, Bolger revealed that his horse would go to Epsom after all, which led to much criticism from punters and bookmakers alike. However, New Approach won the English Derby by a half length, beating the Sir Michael Stoute-trained Tartan Bearer. Bolger has two children, Fi√≥na Bolger and √öna Manning, as well as three grandchildren; Clare Manning, James Manning and Liadan Bolger.

Supported processors implement the Nehalem microarchitecture and therefore have an integrated memory controller (IMC), so the X58 does not have a memory interface. Initially supported processors were the Core i7, but the chip also supported Nehalem and Westmere-based Xeon processors.  Description The QuickPath architecture differs considerably from earlier Intel architectures, and is much closer to AMD's HyperTransport architecture. Except for the lack of a memory interface, the X58 is similar to the traditional northbridge: it communicates with the processor(s) via the high bandwidth QuickPath Interconnect, it communicates with the southbridge via Direct Media Interface (DMI), and it communicates with high bandwidth peripherals via PCI Express (PCIe). The X58 is not a memory controller hub (MCH), because it has no memory interface, so Intel calls it an I/O hub. This should not be confused with the similar term I/O controller hub (ICH) which has traditionally been used to refer to the southbridge chips. Intel documentation now refers to the southbridge as the Legacy I/O Controller Hub. The X58 has 36 PCIe lanes that are arranged in two √ó16 links, DMI link and \\"spare\\"-based link. When used with the ICH10 I/O Controller Hub with √ó4 DMI connection the \\"spare\\" supports a separate √ó4 PCIe connection. Future southbridge chips DMI may support a wider DMI. Each X58 QuickPath Interconnect uses 21 unidirectional differential pairs in each direction, for a total of 84 pins per QPI. At the highest bandwidth, each QPI can transfer up to 12.8 GB/s usable in each direction simultaneously using the QPI protocol. The protocol transfers information in 80 bit flits which contain 8 bits of error correction, 8 bits of QPI routing information, and 64 bits of data. X58 PCIe ports support full PCIe 2.0 bandwidth (e.g., up to 8GB/s including overheads per √ó16 link) and each √ó16 link may be divided into total 16 lanes in any combination of √ó8, √ó4, √ó2 or √ó1 ports. They also support all features of line- reserved wiring, which means that in the combinations of (√ó16 + √ó1/√ó8) slots, often used on the motherboards, not only √ó1 or √ó8 cards may be installed into the √ó1/√ó8 slot, but √ó4 cards should work as well (if not disallowed by the motherboard BIOS.) Unlike the front-side bus (FSB), QPI is a point-to-point interface and supports not only processor-chipset interface, but also processor-to-processor connection and chip-to-chip connection. The X58 has two QPIs and can directly connect to two processors on a multi-socket motherboard or form a ring-like connection (processor 1 to X58 to processor 2 back to processor 1). When used with the Intel Core i7, the second QPI is usually unused (though, in principle, the second X58 might be daisy-chained on the board). When used with the \\"Gainestown\\" DP processor, which will have two QPIs, the X58 and the two processors may be connected in a triangle or ring. For MP processors such as \\"Beckton\\" with more than two QPIs, the X58 is either connected to two processors, which in turn are connected in a \\"mesh\\" of QPIs to other processors or attached \\"in pairs\\" to two different processors. I/O for \\"remote\\" processors is relayed via the inter-processors QPI. X58 board manufacturers can build SLI-compatible Intel chipset boards by submitting their designs to nVidia for validation. However, users wishing to run more than two Nvidia video cards in PCIe √ó16 will still need to purchase motherboards equipped with one or more nVidia nForce chipsets. It is still possible to run more than two video cards in an SLI-configuration at fewer PCIe lane widths. The X58 chipset itself supports up to 36 PCI-Express 2.0 lanes, so it is possible to have two PCIe √ó16 slots and one PCIe √ó4 slot on the same motherboard.

It is the largest college in University of the Philippines System which offers most of the general education subjects required of UPLB students, as well as the highest number of degree programs in the University. The Philippines' Commission on Higher Education has recognized CAS as a Center of Excellence in Biology, Chemistry, Information Technology and Mathematics, as well as a Center of Development in Physics and Statistics. History The Board of Regents of the University of the Philippines at its 828th meeting on 21 December 1972 adopted Presidential Decree No. 58 issued on November 20, 1972 establishing the College of Science and Humanities. The Board appointed Edelwina C. Legaspi as the first dean of the new college, and a month later, Dolores A. Ramirez as secretary. The College's first seven departments were Humanities, Chemistry, Mathematics, Statistics and Physics, Botany, Zoology, Life Sciences and Social Sciences. The college was renamed College of Arts and Sciences on October 28, 1977. On 23 March 1983, CAS reorganized its science and mathematics departments into three institutes: Institute of Mathematical Sciences and Physics from the former Department of Mathematics and Physics, Department of Statistics and Statistical Laboratory and the Computer Science unit; Institute of Chemistry from the former Department of Chemistry and; Institute of Biological Sciences from the former Botany, Life Sciences and Zoology departments. Together with three similar institutes in UP Diliman, they were designed to form part of a system of national centers of excellence in basic sciences. The Division of Computer Science, because of the fast development in the field and rapid growth of student population, became an Institute in January 1996. The Physical Education Department was placed under the CAS and started offering a Diploma in Physical Education. It was eventually renamed Department of Human Kinetics. The Division of Statistics was transformed into an Institute in January 1998. Institutes/Departments * Institute of Biological Sciences (IBS) - Established on March 23, 1983, it offers a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology with specializations in cell and molecular biology, ecology, genetics, microbiology, plant biology, systematics, wildlife biology, and zoology. It also offers 12 graduate degrees: six master's degree, three doctor of philosophy, and three doctor of philosophy by research. Students are admitted to the institute through the University of the Philippines College Admission Test. The institute is composed of five divisions namely on animal biology, environmental biology, genetics and molecular biology, microbiology, and plant biology. In 2014, the undergraduate degree program in Biology of the institute received its certification and accreditation under the ASEAN University Network-Quality Assurance System. Researchers from the institute discovered new species of spiders from Mount Makiling. Other facilities that support the institute are the Limnological Station, UPLB Museum of National History, University of the Philippines Open University, National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, National Crop Protection Center, Institute of Plant Breeding, and International Rice Research Institute. * Institute of Chemistry (IC) * Institute of Computer Science (ICS) * Institute of Mathematical Sciences and Physics (IMSP) * Institute of Statistics (IS) * Department of Humanities (DH) * Department of Social Sciences (DSS) * Department of Human Kinetics (DHK) * UP Rural High School (UPRHS) Undergraduate Degree Programs * BA Communication Arts Majors: Speech, Theater, Writing * BA Philosophy * BA Sociology * BS Applied Mathematics Majors : Actuarial Science, Operations Research, Biomathematics * BS Applied Physics Specializations: Computational Physics, Experimental Physics, Instrumentation Physics * BS Biology Majors: Cell and Molecular Biology, Ecology, Genetics, Microbiology, Plant Biology, Systematics, Wildlife Biology and Zoology * BS Chemistry * BS Computer Science Institute of Computer Science * BS Mathematics * BS Mathematics and Science Teaching Majors : Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Mathematics * BS Statistics Institute of Statistics References External links * College of Arts and Sciences website * University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os Arts and Sciences Category:Educational institutions established in 1972 ","title":"University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os College of Arts and Sciences"},{"id":"17747737","text":"Nav is a village in Badakhshan Province in north-eastern Afghanistan.

The Geological Survey is a division of the Mines Branch. The Survey currently has 5 sections (Regional Geology; Mineral Deposits; Geochemistry, Geophysics and Terrain Sciences; Geoscience Data Management and Geoscience Publications and Information) and a geochemical laboratory. History The first geological surveys of Newfoundland were begun as early as 1839 by Joseph Jukes. It was, however, in 1864 that the first systematic geological investigations began, when the Geological Survey of Newfoundland was inaugurated by Sir William Logan, who, on request of the colonial government appointed Alexander Murray as director.Charles Schuchert, Carl Owen Dunbar, Stratigraphy of western Newfoundland, Geological Society of America, Memoir 1, 1934, pg. 1. Murray and his assistant (and eventual successor), James Howley, were pioneering geologists whose work formed the basis for the first geological map of Newfoundland, published in 1907. After Howley's death in 1909, the Survey was temporarily disbanded. It was resurrected in 1926 under H.A. Baker, but it was not until the 1930s, under the leadership of Government Geologist A.K. Snelgrove, working at Princeton University, that the Geological Survey was revived and a continuous series of geological investigations commenced within the country's Department of Natural Resources.

The indentation allows gardeners to add uncooked vegetable scraps, greywater, and manure into a composting basket that sits in the center of the bed. In this way, composting materials can be added to the basket throughout the growing season to provide nutrients for the plants. The upper layer of soil is hilled up against the center basket so the soil slopes gently down from the center to the sides. Most keyhole gardens rise about one meter above the ground and have walls made of stone. The stone wall not only gives the garden its form, but helps trap moisture within the bed. Keyhole gardens originated in Lesotho and are well adapted to dry arid lands and deserts. In Africa, they are positioned close to the kitchen and used to raise leafy greens such as lettuce, kale, and spinach; herbs; and root crops such as onions, garlic, carrots, and beets. Keyhole gardens are ideal for intensive planting, a technique in which plants are placed close together to maximize production. Plants with wide-reaching root systems such as tomatoes and zucchini may not perform well in a keyhole garden. The keyhole garden was developed in Lesotho by the Consortium for Southern Africa Food Security Emergency (C-SAFE), based upon a design that originated with CARE in Zimbabwe. In the mid-1990s, Lesotho had one of the highest AIDS/HIV rates in the world. C-SAFE designed the keyhole garden for people who suffered from AIDS or were otherwise unable to tend a traditional garden. They are tall enough that people do not have to bend over while working in them, sturdy enough that a person who is weak can lean against them while they work, and small enough that the entire bed is within arm‚Äôs reach. The garden is constructed using layers of compost, manure, wood ash and other nutrient-rich materials so they are more productive than most home gardens; they hold water making them drought-resistant. The walls can be made of common stones picked up from a field, cinderblocks, bricks, or any material strong enough to hold in the soil. Clean water is used when watering the plants on the surface, while household greywater is poured down into the compost basket. While they are designed for people who were too sick to tend a traditional garden, because they were so productive, people in good health started building them as kitchen gardens. Here the family could grow its high-value crops using succession planting. In the end, C-SAFE helped build over 20,000 keyhole gardens, and when they returned a couple of years later, more than 90% were still in use. Today, keyhole gardens are found in many places throughout Africa, including Ethiopia, Rwanda, Kenya, Sudan, and Nigeria. African-style keyhole gardens have been built in Texas and other places in the US. The Texas Master Gardeners Association has put on several workshops to promote them. They have modified the basic design, having standardized on a 6-foot-wide bed with a 12-inch tube made of rabbit fencing or chicken wire for the compost basket. It is common in Texas to add red-wiggler worms to the compost basket to help break down the organic matter. The term \\"keyhole garden\\" is also used in permaculture to describe a garden bed that has been laid out with one or more paths that dead-end rather than continuing through, in order to reduce the area of paths. Permaculture keyhole gardens tend to be wider and flatter than the African variety and do not generally incorporate a compost basket or compost pile built into the bed. The tall beds that incorporate compost are referred to as \\"banana circles\\" by permaculturalists.

They had intended to emigrate to Canada but, during a stop in Leith, the Bains met with a cousin who persuaded them to settle in Edinburgh instead. After leaving school, Bain joined a firm of printers in Edinburgh while, between the age of 15 and 21, studying art on a part-time basis, attending the School of Applied Art and the Edinburgh School of Art. His first exhibited work as a painter was in 1900 at the Royal Scottish Academy.Susan E. Seright, \\"George Bain, Master of Celtic Art\\", 1999, page 2. In 1902 he obtained a scholarship to the Royal College of Art in London. When there, he found that a foundation of Classical Art still controlled the work of the college. In London, he supported himself by working as a freelance newspaper artist and as a book and magazine illustrator. In 1905 he returned to Edinburgh, continuing his career as a commercial artist while studying part-time at the Royal Scottish Academy Life School.Susan E. Seright, \\"George Bain, Master of Celtic Art\\", 1999, page 3. In 1911 he decided to return to studying and gained a DA degree from Edinburgh College of Art in 1915. During World War 1 Bain served with the Royal Engineers and his artistic talents were used both as artist to the 26th Division's theatre and when attached to General Gay's final advance through Bulgaria. Sketches and paintings from this period form part of the George Bain Collection cared for by Groam House Museum. After the war Bain was appointed Principal Art Teacher at Kirkcaldy High School, where he had started his teaching activities in 1899, and in due course also held the post of Principal Advisory Art Teacher for the Kirkcaldy area. He retired from teaching in 1946 and moved to Drumnadrochit in Glenurquhart, the birthplace of his wife Jesse (married 1908). There he attempted to establish a College of Celtic Cultures at a nearby mansion, Balmacaan House. His vision was to \\"give the people of the Highlands a unique opportunity to study their own history, to build up afresh the national Celtic art, and to solve some of the agricultural problems peculiar to the hills and glens of the north of Scotland.\\" For a variety of reasons, particularly the difficulty of obtaining financial support, Bain had to give up the idea and in 1952 he and Jesse moved to Codsall in Staffordshire where they shared a large house with their daughter Christy and her husband. Bain had a studio in the house and he continued with lecture tours and worked on artistic commissions. Jesse died in 1957 and Bain himself on 25 March 1968.  Artistic achievements and contribution to the Celtic Art revival  Bain was the first artist to analyse and deconstruct the designs found on Pictish sculpture and metalwork, and on illuminated manuscripts such as the Book of Kells and the Lindisfarne Gospels.Exhibition catalogue \\"George Bain Collection, 2013\\", Groam House Museum His book Celtic Art: The Methods of Construction was published in 1951. It had little impact at the time, but on its re-issue in 1972The Continuum of Celtic Interlace it introduced a generation to Celtic knotwork, the Pictish stones, the Book of Kells and the Book of Durrow. As well as describing and illustrating over 200 historical examples, his book was notable for giving detailed instructions on creating similar interlace, spiral, and key pattern designs, and encouraging their use in craftwork. An unlicensed derivative of a Bail knotwork appears on the original cover of King Crimson's Discipline album; in later releases, it was replaced by a knotwork designed by Steve Ball, A Bain design was used to illustrate a rug by Quayle and Tranter, a carpet manufacturer based in Kidderminster, England. His son Iain Bain, an engineer, later wrote two books - \\"Celtic Knotwork\\" and \\"Celtic Key Patterns\\" that were intended to simplify the creation of knotwork and keypattern designs by using grid lines and diagonals rather than the mathematical formulae applied by his father.Susan E. Seright, \\"George Bain, Master of Celtic Art\\", 1999, page 23. The majority of Bain's surviving artworks are curated by the Groam House Museum in Rosemarkie, Scotland.  A Recognised Collection of National Significance for Scotland  George Bain's archive of drawings, designs and artefacts is now cared for by Groam House Museum. The collection was awarded Recognised Collection of National Significance for Scotland status by Museums Galleries Scotland in 2013.

Commissioned between 1985‚Äì87, it is located on the River Shannon near Kilrush, County Clare. It was constructed at a cost of more than ¬£700m in one of the largest capital projects in the history of the state. The station operates largely on coal, making it both unique in the context of Irish electricity production and the country's single largest emitter of greenhouse gases.http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/newtech-solution-could-clean- up-moneypoint-64089.html Irish Independent Business It is capable of meeting around 25% of customer demand across the country. It has two Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) storage tanks with a capacity of 50,000 tonnes which can be used as a back-up fuel if required. Three Brown Boveri four-cylinder, single-shaft impulse reaction turbines are directly connected to three generators which generate the power. The steam is generated by three Foster Wheeler two-pass boilers, which convert water into high pressure steam by combustion of the coal. The power station chimneys, at 218m, are the tallest free-standing structures in Ireland. History Moneypoint was under construction from 1979 to 1987. Before its construction, Ireland depended heavily on imported oil for its energy. The 1970s sharp increase in oil prices over a short period of time led the government and the Electricity Supply Board to choose coal as a fuel, as it was seen as a plentiful resource with a stable price. In 2019, the government launched its climate action plan which included a commitment to end the burning of coal in Moneypoint by 2025, and replace coal-fired generation with \\"low-carbon and renewable technologies\\". However to date no details have been provided on what technologies are being explored to replace coal.

The Spanish name roble de sabana, meaning \\"savannah oak\\", is widely used in Costa Rica, probably because it often remains in heavily deforested areas and because of the resemblance of its wood to that of oak trees.Hernan Rodriguez Navas. 2007. La Utilidad de las Plantas Medicinales en Costa Rica. EUNA, Heredia, Costa Rica. 213pp. It is the national tree of El Salvador, where it is called \\"Maquil√≠shuat\\". Distribution and habitat This species is distributed from southern M√©xico, to Venezuela and Ecuador. It has been found growing from sealevel to , in temperatures ranging from 20 ¬∞C to 30 ¬∞C on average, with annual rainfall above 500 mm, and on soils with very variable pH. This tree is often seen in Neotropical cities, where it is often planted in parks and gardens. In the rainy season it offers shade and, in the dry season, abundant flowers are present on the defoliated trees. Description The tree crown is wide, with irregular, stratified ramification and only few thick branches. The bark can be gray to brown, in varying darkness and may be vertically fissured. Leaves are compound, digitate and deciduous. Each leaf has five leaflets of variable size, the middle one being the largest. Flowering occurs mainly in January and February, and is generally associated with dry periods; although flowering has also been observed in August, September, April and May. Flowers are large, in various tones of pink to purple, and appear while the tree has none, or very few, leaves. Pollination occurs probably by insects, although the flowers are visited by many birds such as tanagers, hummingbirds and orioles. The long and slender fruit capsules can measure up to and appear from February through April. After the drying fruit dehisces, the anemochorous, hyaline-membrane-winged seeds are released. There are an average of 45,000 seeds per kg with up to 13% water content. Germination of seeds is extremely easy and efficient, reaching almost 100%. It is a fairly fast growing tree. Medicinal uses Preparations of the bark of the tree are consumed to eliminate intestinal parasites, malaria and uterine cancer. A decoction of the bark is recommended for anemia and constipation. A decoction of the flowers, leaves and roots has been used to reduce fevers and pain, cause sweating, to treat tonsil inflammation and various other disorders. Among the various active phytochemicals in the tree is lapachol, a natural organic compound isolated from various other Tabebuia species.Record, Samuel J. Lapachol. Tropical Woods (1925), 1 7-9. Chemically, it is a derivative of naphthoquinone, related to vitamin K. Once studied as a possible treatment for some types of cancer, lapachol's potential is now considered low due to its toxic side effects.Oral toxicology studies with lapachol. Morrison, Robert K.; Brown, Donald Emerson; Oleson, Jerome J.; Cooney, David A. Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology (1970), 17(1), 1-11. Lapachol also has antimalarial and antipanasomal effects.Gupta, M. 1995. 270 Plantas Medicinales Iberoamericanas. Santa Fe de Bogota. Convenio Andres Bello.

String. A studio journal has been posted on YouTube documenting the progress of Midheaven. The studio journal was shot and edited by Nick Guillen. Four video teasers have been made by the band's director Michael Grodner (The Human Abstract, Planes Mistaken For Stars, The Briggs, Chiodos) for the band's first music video from Midheaven, \\"Procession of the Fates\\". The video was shot months before the song was written and recorded to generate the overall concept of the entire record. The album debuted at #163 on The Billboard Top 200 with first week sales of 4,100.  Sound and theme  Before recording the album, The Human Abstract departed from its founding member A.J. Minette, who wished to pursue other musical goals outside of metal. Minette was replaced by Andrew Tapley, and at this time the band had also adopted a new member, Sean Leonard, playing various keyboard instruments.\\"The Human Abstract Announces New Members\\" metalunderground.com. Retrieved on August 22, 2008. These changes allowed a change in musical style for the band. The production of the album also saw a change while recording. Producer Toby Wright (Korn, Slayer, Alice in Chains) had initially been brought in to work on the record, however Wright \\"was wiped off of all the credits\\" due to musical differences, and the band finished the album with Leonard Simone, Jesse E. String co-producing the album. After the new band line up was set, Nathan Ells reassured fans that, \\"The Human Abstract has always been, and will continue to be, a heavy band.\\" However, Midheaven departs from the hardcore sound found on The Human Abstract's debut release Nocturne. Although the album does feature heavy parts, it focuses more on the alternative and progressive side. It also contains more singing than screaming when compared to Nocturne. One reviewer said, \\"You definitely need to have an open mind going into Midheaven. Don't expect Nocturne Pt. 2; you will be sorely disappointed if you do.\\"Marsicano, Dan. \\"The Human Abstract - Midheaven Review\\" 411mania.com. Retrieved on August 22, 2008. Midheaven is a concept album that tells the story of one unnamed man. The Human Abstract tried to create a story that is \\"something with a storyline that tells real stories about real people, something that tells a story that lies so deeply within the human cycle of being, that it has always been, and may always be within the recesses of our conscious thought.\\" To effectively create the concept the band created a theme, unique to each song, that tied into the overall concept. From there the band would, \\"try to capture the mood musically for what each theme represents.\\" Ells stated that the story \\"follows a full cycle of man while he makes his ascent and discoveries and is eventually brought down by his lust of conquest and greed.\\" The cover art theme and style is heavily influenced by Robert Parke-Harrison.The Artist who influenced the cover - Robert Parke-Harrison Retrieved on August 19, 2008 The album artwork was done by original bassist Kenny Arehart.

Music videos  Two music videos have been released for the songs \\"Procession of the Fates\\" and \\"Counting Down the Days\\". The video for \\"Processions of the Fates\\" starts with slogans saying \\"Doomed to repeat our history\\" and \\"What will bravery do for us now?\\". It then goes on to scenes of bombs being dropped for a minute, before turning on a man who is creating things in a dark room. About halfway through the video we see him plant a small cutting in a field, and near the end of the video we see a shot of the field filled with lightbulbs, a shot very similar to the one on the cover of Midheaven. The video for \\"Counting Down the Days\\" features shots of the band, together with scenes shot in stop motion of strange creatures, attempting to build a doomsday device.

The club has three teams. The Saturday XI, having traditionally played friendlies, from 2009 competes in the Northamptonshire Cricket League. The Sunday XI plays friendly fixtures against an established selection of clubs. The Midweek XI competes in the Market Harborough District Midweek Evening League and Knockout competitions. Gumley Top Gumley is a small village in South East Leicestershire. The nearest large town is Market Harborough. The cricket field is found on the North West edge of the village on the road to Laughton. The field has extensive views of the valley looking South from the pavilion, and is characterised by the road which bisects a small portion of the outfield between the square and the pavilion. Motorists are relatively few on this particular stretch, but those that do arrive during a game are politely asked by way of a sign to wait until the end of the over. Facilities have improved markedly over recent years. The concerted efforts of several club members have raised the quality of the square. Fund raising efforts have yielded many improvements to the pavilion, in particular a much needed new roof. Touring The club arranges an annual tour of 4 matches on consecutive days from the Thursday after the late Mary Bank Holiday. Recent venues include Margate, Braintree, Barnstaple, Havant, and this year, Harrogate. The tour has been a regular feature of the club calendar for over 20 years.

On the cricket side, the intra-club Twenty20 day has proved very popular. The last game of each season is the keenly fought Club Match. This has traditionally been a Saturday vs Sunday affair, but with the better players gravitating to the League side, a new format was introduced in 2009 of 'Greys' (being over 35) vs 'Kids'. A recent addition to the calendar is Presidents Day. This is seen as an opportunity to say 'thank you' to our benefactors and features the Sunday team taking on a Select XI. Away from cricket, a variety of social and fund-raising events are held throughout the year, ranging from golf days to millionaires evenings and race nights. The club arranges a fireworks display each Guy Fawkes night, in conjunction with the local Scout troop. This event regularly attracts a very large audience from the surrounding villages.

He was the captain of the ACT Brumbies rugby union club in the Super Rugby competition and the Australia national rugby union team. He usually plays at blindside flanker or number-eight. Early life Mowen was born in Brisbane and educated at Villanova College. He played for the Brisbane Easts club, and captained the Queensland under 19s. At the 2005 Under 21 Rugby World Championship he captained Australia to finish second. Rugby career Mowen made his Super Rugby debut in 2006 Super 14 season for the Queensland Reds against the Sharks. He made only other six appearances for Reds during the season, all being in non-competition matches, so he moved to the Waratahs in 2007, joining Randwick in the Shute Shield competition. Late in the 2011 Super Rugby season Mowen was forced to leave the Waratahs to allow for Rocky Elsom's return from the Brumbies. In July 2011 Mowen signed a two-year contract to play under Jake White at the Brumbies, being made captain for the 2012 season. In June 2013, former Wallaby, Stephen Larkham stated that, after some doubts, Mowen had turned out to be one of the best leaders he has ever encountered. He made his Wallaby debut on 22 June 2013, against the British and Irish Lions in the position of blindside flanker. He maintained his spot in the team for the entire series. On 31 October 2013, he replaced James Horwill as captain of the Wallabies. Mowen left Australia at the end of the 2014 Super Rugby season. He has said of his departure from test rugby: \\"I am probably the first (Wallabies captain to be in this situation), but I'm also probably the first bloke to make his Test debut at 28 and retire at 29.\\" Reference list External links * Category:Australian rugby union players Category:Australia international rugby union players Category:Australian rugby union captains Category:Brumbies players Category:Living people Category:New South Wales Waratahs players Category:People educated at Villanova College (Australia) Category:Queensland Reds players Category:Rugby union number eights Category:Rugby union players from Brisbane Category:1984 births Category:Montpellier H√©rault Rugby players Category:Australian expatriate rugby union players Category:Australian expatriate sportspeople in France Category:Expatriate rugby union players in France ","title":"Ben Mowen"},{"id":"17748148","text":"\\"Wreck on the Highway\\" is a song written and performed by Bruce Springsteen. It was originally released as the final track on his fifth album, The River. The version released on The River was recorded at The Power Station in New York in March‚ÄìApril 1980.Brucebase, On The Tracks: The River As well as being the last track on The River, it was the last song recorded for the album. A melancholic song with a false ending, \\"Wreck on the Highway\\" features prominent organ and acoustic guitar parts. The song is structured as a folk ballad with four verses of five lines each. The rhyming pattern of the verse endings is generally A-B-C-C-B, but this is not followed absolutely strictly. The lyrics describe a man who witnesses a hit-and-run auto accident on a rainy, isolated highway, and is subsequently haunted by the vision and unable to sleep. After the first three verses focus on the specific incident, the last verse broadens the theme to encompass more universal themes of life and death. The singer thinks about the life that was lost, and the people who may have loved him, and he knows he will be haunted by the incident for the rest of his life. Springsteen has explained the theme by stating that after seeing the accident the singer \\"realizes that you have a limited number of opportunities to love someone, to do your work, to be part of something, to parent your children, to do something good.\\" It is directly inspired by Roy Acuff's country song of the same name and similar theme from the 1940s, which is a cover version of the 1938 recorded song, \\"I Didn't Hear Nobody Pray\\", by the Dixon Brothers.Richard Carlin, Country Music, p. 108 While Springsteen's song has elements of a country arrangement, its music is more haunted and less sentimental. Along with the title track, \\"Independence Day\\" and \\"Point Blank\\", it is one of the verse-chorus songs on The River that was essentially a short story or character sketch. \\"Wreck on the Highway\\" and a few other songs on The River, such as the title track and \\"Stolen Car\\", mark a new direction in Bruce Springsteen's songwriting: these ballads imbued with a sense of hopelessness anticipate his next album, Nebraska, as well as a turn towards pessimism in his overall artistic and personal world-view. Springsteen himself has noted that \\"Wreck on the Highway\\" is one of the songs reflecting a shift in his songwriting style, linking The River to Nebraska. A slow-tempo song, \\"Wreck on the Highway\\" has not been particularly common in concert, with about 100 performances in Bruce Springsteen concerts through 2008. Nearly all of those performances occurred during the 1980‚Äì1981 River Tour.The Bruce Springsteen Setlist Page The song was revived occasionally for electric piano performances on the 2005 solo Devils & Dust Tour.Backstreets.com: 2005 Setlists Naturally, the song was played every night during the 2016 \\"River Tour\\" during which the entire album was played at the outset of each show. In the UK, it was released as the B-side of the single \\"Cadillac Ranch\\". Literary reception Author Patrick Humphries describes the song as distilling \\"the essence of what makes Bruce Springsteen great: a looping, loping and involving melody, heartfelt vocal and acutely visual lyrics.\\" June Skinner Sawyers describes it as \\"a perfect song, a masterpiece in miniature, and a haunting meditation on mortality and what it means to be alive.\\" Music critic Clinton Heylin described the version that was released on the album as a \\"near-cataleptic coda to 'Drive All Night,'\\" the previous song on the album, although Heylin felt that an earlier version of the song, with a faster, \\"countrabilly\\" arrangement, was more interesting. Heylin also described the song as Springsteen's \\"semi-ironic farewell to albums about cars and girls.\\" Music critic Dave Marsh describes the song as an appropriate closer for The River as it \\"pares down the situation from 'Drive All Night'\\" of the singer and his lover trying to ignore the distractions around them down \\"to one man facing the world again.\\" To Marsh, the singer in \\"Wreck on the Highway\\" may well have been the hero from other songs on The River such as \\"Ramrod,\\" \\"Cadillac Ranch,\\" \\"The River\\" or \\"Stolen Car,\\" or even the heroes from earlier Springsteen albums such as Born to Run and Darkness on the Edge of Town, but regardless Marsh feels that \\"he sees and speaks and sings for all of them.\\" References External links * Lyrics & Audio clips from Brucespringsteen.net * Category:Bruce Springsteen songs Category:1980 songs Category:Songs written by Bruce Springsteen Category:Song recordings produced by Jon Landau Category:Vehicle wreck ballads Category:Song recordings produced by Bruce Springsteen Category:Song recordings produced by Steven Van Zandt ","title":"Wreck on the Highway (Bruce Springsteen song)"},{"id":"17748171","text":"Fang Chengguo () (14 December 1943 - 27 January 2009)Fang Chengguo's obituary was a Chinese senior banker, governor/president of the Bank of Communications, and vice-president of the Agricultural Bank of China.

Early life and Murphy association Dolan was born in Loughrea, County Galway, Ireland and moved to the United States at the age of five with his family. He served in the Union Army from 1863 until the Civil War's end, after which he moved to Lincoln County, New Mexico. He worked as a clerk for Lawrence Murphy, and by 1874 the two men were business partners in a mercantile and banking operation. The venture was highly successful and profitable, particularly since there was no competition. In May 1873, Dolan attempted to shoot US Cavalry Captain James Randlett at Fort Stanton, resulting in \\"L. G. Murphy & Co.\\" being evicted from the fort. On May 9, 1877, Dolan killed Hilario Jaramillo, claiming that the latter had charged him with a knife. George Peppin, a recent friend, later married Jaramillo's widow. It would be the only killing he would personally commit, preferring thereafter to hire others to commit acts of violence under his direction. By this time, however, Dolan had become close friends with Sheriff William J. Brady, with whom he had a close alliance. Because of the lack of competition, the Murphy-Dolan businesses charged high prices for their goods, making them hated by local farmers and ranchers. To counter this, in 1876 John Tunstall, a middle class businessman from London, and Alexander McSween, a Presbyterian lawyer from Canada, opened a competing business, with the support of cattle baron John Chisum. The general store and bank, called \\"J. H. Tunstall & Co\\", was located near to the Murphy-Dolan businesses, in Lincoln, New Mexico, and enraged Dolan. In letters to his family in London, Tunstall said that he intended to not only unseat Murphy and Dolan, but also to build the same kind of business monopoly that they had once enjoyed. Tunstall also wrote that his intention was to become so powerful that half of every dollar earned by anyone in Lincoln County would find its way into his pocket. Dolan challenged Tunstall to a gunfight, but the latter refused, as he preferred to let others do the killing for him. Preparing for war, Dolan hired members of the Seven Rivers Warriors, the Jesse Evans Gang and the John Kinney Gang. In response, Tunstall and McSween formed a gang of their own called the Lincoln County Regulators. The ranks included Richard \\"Dick\\" Brewer, Charlie Bowdre, Billy the Kid, Doc Scurlock, George Coe and Frank Coe. Lincoln County War On February 18, 1878, Tunstall was shot and killed, officially while resisting arrest, by Deputies Jesse Evans, William Morton, Tom Hill and Frank Baker. This sparked what would become known as the Lincoln County War, one of the most famous range wars. Although Dolan was suspected of ordering the killing, Sheriff Brady did nothing. Alex McSween then took command of the Regulators which included the primary protagonists of Tunstall, who were deputized to capture and bring in Evans, Morton, Baker and Hill. William Morton and Frank Baker were captured on March 6 by the Regulators, who on March 9, 1878 executed them both when the group was surprised by Dolan-Murphy cowboys, along with fellow Regulator William McCloskey, who was suspected to have betrayed the Regulators and of being on Dolan's payroll. That same day Evans and Hill attempted to disperse sheep on a local farm, and Hill was killed by the sheep farmer, while Evans was wounded. During that period, Dolan offered a $1000 reward for anyone who would kill Alexander McSween. On April 1, 1878, the Regulators ambushed and murdered Sheriff Brady and Deputy George W. Hindman. According to Robert Marshall Utley, the murder of Sherrif Brady was ordered by Alexander McSween, who had learned that the Sherrif was carrying an arrest warrant for him. As Sheriff Brady and Deputy Hindman lay dead, Regulator Billy the Kid ran from the place of ambush in order to remove the arrest warrant from the Sheriff's pocket. Instead, the Kid was driven back and wounded by the gunfire of one of Sheriff Brady's Deputies. Several killings followed, committed by both the Regulators and the gunmen hired by Dolan, who were often led by Jesse Evans. John Copeland was appointed to replace Brady, but when he refused to side with either faction, preferring to remain neutral and deal with both sides accordingly, he was dismissed and replaced by George Peppin, who was plainly on the side of the Murphy-Dolan faction. The range war lasted through July, 1878, culminating in the Battle of Lincoln. Aftermath When the range war ended, Susan McSween hired attorney Huston Chapman to pursue charges against Dolan and others, in addition to working toward amnesty for the Regulators. On February 18, 1879, one year to the day after Tunstall was murdered, Evans and Billy Campbell killed Chapman, then fled the territory. That murder also was attributed to Dolan, though his involvement was never proven. Dolan was indicted for the murder of Tunstall, but was acquitted. Last years Dolan later suffered from alcoholism, but did serve as the Lincoln County Treasurer for a time, as well as in the Territorial Senate. He died on his ranch in 1898, aged 49, having finally acquired all of Tunstall's property as well. Much of the land was later expropriated by the Federal government as part of land conservation with the substantial remainder later being sold off.

Oxford, Pergamon Press, 1964. This is for example relevant for the design of anti-reflective coatings and dielectric mirrors. The reflection of light from a single interface between two media is described by the Fresnel equations. However, when there are multiple interfaces, such as in the figure, the reflections themselves are also partially transmitted and then partially reflected. Depending on the exact path length, these reflections can interfere destructively or constructively. The overall reflection of a layer structure is the sum of an infinite number of reflections. The transfer-matrix method is based on the fact that, according to Maxwell's equations, there are simple continuity conditions for the electric field across boundaries from one medium to the next. If the field is known at the beginning of a layer, the field at the end of the layer can be derived from a simple matrix operation. A stack of layers can then be represented as a system matrix, which is the product of the individual layer matrices. The final step of the method involves converting the system matrix back into reflection and transmission coefficients. Formalism for electromagnetic waves Below is described how the transfer matrix is applied to electromagnetic waves (for example light) of a given frequency propagating through a stack of layers at normal incidence. It can be generalized to deal with incidence at an angle, absorbing media, and media with magnetic properties. We assume that the stack layers are normal to the z\\\\, axis and that the field within one layer can be represented as the superposition of a left- and right-traveling wave with wave number k\\\\,, :E(z) = E_r e^{ikz} + E_l e^{-ikz}\\\\,. Because it follows from Maxwell's equation that E\\\\, and H=1/ik Z_c dE/dz\\\\, must be continuous across a boundary, it is convenient to represent the field as the vector (E(z),H(z))\\\\,, where :H(z) = 1/Z_c E_r e^{ikz} - 1/Z_c E_l e^{-ikz}\\\\,. Since there are two equations relating E\\\\, and H\\\\, to E_r\\\\, and E_l\\\\,, these two representations are equivalent. In the new representation, propagation over a distance L\\\\, into the positive z\\\\, direction is described by the unimodular matrix :M = \\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{cc} \\\\cos kL & i Z_c \\\\sin kL \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{i}{Z_c} \\\\sin kL & \\\\cos kL \\\\end{array} \\\\right), and :\\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{c} E(z+L) \\\\\\\\\\\\ H(z+L) \\\\end{array} \\\\right) = M\\\\cdot \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{c} E(z) \\\\\\\\\\\\ H(z) \\\\end{array} \\\\right) Such a matrix can represent propagation through a layer if k\\\\, is the wave number in the medium and L\\\\, the thickness of the layer: For a system with N\\\\, layers, each layer j\\\\, has a transfer matrix M_j\\\\,, where j\\\\, increases towards higher z\\\\, values. The system transfer matrix is then :M_s = M_N \\\\cdot \\\\ldots \\\\cdot M_2 \\\\cdot M_1. Typically, one would like to know the reflectance and transmittance of the layer structure. If the layer stack starts at z=0\\\\,, then for negative z\\\\,, the field is described as :E_L(z) = E_0 e^{ik_Lz} + r E_0 e^{-ik_Lz},\\\\qquad z<0, where E_0\\\\, is the amplitude of the incoming wave, k_L\\\\, the wave number in the left medium, and r\\\\, is the amplitude (not intensity!) reflectance coefficient of the layer structure. On the other side of the layer structure, the field consists of a right-propagating transmitted field :E_R(z) = t E_0 e^{ik_R z},\\\\qquad z>L', where t\\\\, is the amplitude transmittance, k_R\\\\, is the wave number in the rightmost medium, and L' is the total thickness. If H_L = 1/ik Z_c dE_L/dz\\\\, and H_R = 1/ik Z_c dE_R/dz\\\\,, then we can solve :\\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{c} E(z_R) \\\\\\\\\\\\ H(z_R) \\\\end{array} \\\\right) = M\\\\cdot \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{c} E(0) \\\\\\\\\\\\ H(0) \\\\end{array} \\\\right) in terms of the matrix elements M_{mn}\\\\, of the system matrix M_s\\\\, and obtain :t = 2 i k_L e^{-i k_R L}\\\\left[\\\\frac{1}{-M_{21} + k_L k_R M_{12} + i(k_R M_{11} + k_L M_{22})}\\\\right] and :r = \\\\left[\\\\frac{ (M_{21} + k_L k_R M_{12}) + i(k_L M_{22} - k_R M_{11})}{(-M_{21} + k_L k_R M_{12}) + i(k_L M_{22} + k_R M_{11})}\\\\right]. The transmittance and reflectance (i.e., the fractions of the incident intensity \\\\leftE_0\\\\right^2 transmitted and reflected by the layer) are often of more practical use and are given by T=\\\\frac{k_R}{k_L}t^2\\\\, and R=r^2\\\\,, respectively (at normal incidence). Example As an illustration, consider a single layer of glass with a refractive index n and thickness d suspended in air at a wave number k (in air). In glass, the wave number is k'=nk\\\\,. The transfer matrix is :M=\\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{cc}\\\\cos k'd & \\\\sin(k'd)/k' \\\\\\\\\\\\ -k' \\\\sin k'd & \\\\cos k'd \\\\end{array}\\\\right). The amplitude reflection coefficient can be simplified to :r = \\\\frac{(1/n - n) \\\\sin(k'd)}{(n+1/n)\\\\sin(k'd) + 2 i \\\\cos(k'd)}. This configuration effectively describes a Fabry‚ÄìP√©rot interferometer or etalon: for k'd=0, \\\\pi, 2\\\\pi, \\\\cdots\\\\,, the reflection vanishes. Acoustic waves It is possible to apply the transfer-matrix method to sound waves. Instead of the electric field E and its derivative F, the displacement u and the stress \\\\sigma=C du/dz, where C is the p-wave modulus, should be used. Abeles matrix formalism Reflection from a stratified interface The Abeles matrix methodO. S. Heavens. Optical Properties of Thin Films. Butterworth, London (1955).L. Nevot, P. Croce, Revue de physique appliqu√©e, 15, 761 (1980).F. Abel√®s, Le Journal de Physique et le Radium, \\"La th√©orie g√©n√©rale des couches minces\\", 11, 307‚Äì310 (1950). is a computationally fast and easy way to calculate the specular reflectivity from a stratified interface, as a function of the perpendicular momentum transfer, Qz: :Q_z=\\\\frac{4\\\\pi}{\\\\lambda}\\\\sin\\\\theta=2k_z where Œ∏ is the angle of incidence/reflection of the incident radiation and Œª is the wavelength of the radiation. The measured reflectivity depends on the variation in the scattering length density (SLD) profile, œÅ(z), perpendicular to the interface. Although the scattering length density profile is normally a continuously varying function, the interfacial structure can often be well approximated by a slab model in which layers of thickness (dn), scattering length density (œÅn) and roughness (œÉn,n+1) are sandwiched between the super- and sub-phases. One then uses a refinement procedure to minimise the differences between the theoretical and measured reflectivity curves, by changing the parameters that describe each layer. In this description the interface is split into n layers. Since the incident neutron beam is refracted by each of the layers the wavevector, k, in layer n, is given by: :k_n=\\\\sqrt{{k_z}^2-4\\\\pi({\\\\rho}_n-{\\\\rho}_0)} The Fresnel reflection coefficient between layer n and n+1 is then given by: : r_{n,n+1} = \\\\frac{k_{n}-k_{n+1}}{k_{n}+k_{n+1}} Since the interface between each layer is unlikely to be perfectly smooth the roughness/diffuseness of each interface modifies the Fresnel coefficient and is accounted for by an error function, as described by Nevot and Croce (1980). :r_{n,n+1} = \\\\frac{k_{n}-k_{n+1}}{k_{n}+k_{n+1}}\\\\exp(-2k_{n}k_{n+1}{\\\\sigma_{n,n+1}}^2) A phase factor, Œ≤, is introduced, which accounts for the thickness of each layer. :\\\\beta_{0} = 0 :\\\\beta_{n} = i k_{n}d_{n} where i^2 = -1. A characteristic matrix, cn is then calculated for each layer. :c_{n}=\\\\left[\\\\begin{array}{cc} \\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\beta_{n}\\\\right) & r_{n,n+1}\\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\beta_{n}\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\ r_{n,n+1}\\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\beta_{n}\\\\right) & \\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\beta_{n}\\\\right)\\\\end{array}\\\\right] The resultant matrix is defined as the product of these characteristic matrices :M=\\\\prod_{n}c_{n} from which the reflectivity is calculated as: :R=\\\\left\\\\frac{M_{10}}{M_{00}}\\\\right^{2}  See also  *Neutron reflectometry *Ellipsometry *Jones calculus *X-ray reflectivity References Further reading *Multilayer Reflectivity: first-principles derivation of the transmission and reflection probabilities from a multilayer with complex indices of refraction. *Layered Materials and Photonic Band Diagrams (Lecture 23) in MIT Open Course Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Properties of Materials. *EM Wave Propagation Through Thin Films & Multilayers (Lecture 13) in MIT Open Course Nano-to-Macro Transport Processes.

It is often called The Ireland that we dreamed of,Ferriter 2007, pp.238, 286, 363‚Äì4 a phrase which is used within it, or the \\"comely maidens\\" speech, a misquotation. The speech marked the 50th anniversary of the foundation of the Gaelic League (Conradh na Gaeilge), a group promoting Irish culture and the Irish language. In the most frequently quoted passage of the speech, de Valera set out his vision of an ideal Ireland: De Valera had made an annual radio speech on St Patrick's Day since coming to power after the 1932 election.Ferriter 2007, p.308 At the time the 1943 speech was made, the Second World War was raging and the threat of German invasion (Operation Green) or British re-occupation (Plan W) was very real. The 1943 speech in later years has been critiqued and often derided as archetypal of de Valera's traditionalist view of an isolationist, agricultural land where women held a traditional role. The phrase most commonly cited in this regard is the misquotation \\"comely maidens dancing at the crossroads\\". The speech in fact made no mention of crossroads dances, a rural tradition then dying out. Although de Valera actually said \\"happy maidens\\" in the broadcast, the phrase was \\"comely maidens\\" in the prepared text sent in advance to the newspapers, printed in the following day's Irish Press, and reprinted in Maurice Moynihan's 1980 anthology. It was a double LP record of speeches from the RT√â archives, released in 1982 on the centenary of his birth, which brought the correct wording back to public notice. In 2007, J. J. Lee and Diarmaid Ferriter argued for a reappraisal of the speech in the light of the Celtic Tiger consumption bubble and the Moriarty Tribunal revelations of corruption by 1980s Taoiseach Charles Haughey. Similarly, David McCullagh in 2018 suggests that its advocacy of \\"frugal comfort\\" was motivated by egalitarianism: \\"to ensure a minimum for everyone, the better off would have to accept a lower standard of living\\". Lee suggested de Valera's \\"Victorian language\\" gave his vision an antiquated tone that hid the continuing relevance of much of its vision.Ferriter 2007, pp.363‚Äì4 Ferriter called it \\"the most famous broadcast by any Irish politician of the twentieth century\\".

Running north‚Äìsouth, the road stretches between U.S. Route 30 on the north and Blanton Street, just south of Oregon Route 8, on the south. The road passes through Washington and Multnomah counties, crossing the Tualatin Mountains at Cornelius Pass, above sea level. TriMet's MAX Light Rail line (Blue Line or Westside MAX) travels over the road on a bridge. Route description Cornelius Pass at Baseline Road in 2009 Cornelius Pass Road begins at an intersection with Southeast Blanton Street in southern Hillsboro, about one block south of the Tualatin Valley Highway (OR 8). It travels north across a set of railroad tracks and intersects OR 8 before continuing into Hillsboro's suburban neighborhoods. The street passes under a viaduct carrying light rail trains on the Blue Line near Quatama station near the Orenco Woods Nature Park. From the undercrossing, the highway travels through several business parks on the east side of Intel's main factory, connected by the intersecting Cornell Road and Evergreen Parkway. Cornelius Pass Road then reaches an interchange with U.S. Route 26 (the Sunset Highway) and turns northeast as it leaves Hillsboro. The highway winds its way around farms and forestland as it ascends into the Tualatin Mountains, reaching its highest point at Cornelius Pass, elevation . The narrow road then descends from the mountains along McCarthy Creek and approaches the Multnomah Channel of the Columbia River, terminating at an intersection with U.S. Route 30 northwest of Portland. Cornelius Pass is one of only two main north‚Äìsouth connecting roads in Hillsboro. The former country road handles 11,000 drivers each day and is an arterial route from the Tualatin Valley between Hillsboro to the Columbia River north of Portland. A mountainous road at points, 1,500 of the 11,000 vehicles each day are tractor-trailers on the road designed to handle up to 10,000 vehicles per day. A portion of the road, from US 26 to Cornell, is part of the National Highway System. As of 2010, the average daily traffic on the road in Washington County from north to south was 8,130 vehicles just north of Germantown Road, 11,003 just south of Germantown, 17,947 a little south of West Union Road, 38,860 just north of Imbrie Drive, 26,542 just north of Cornell Road, 18,863 a bit north of Quatama Road, 18,208 just north of Baseline Road, 21,156 a little south of Baseline, and 16,294 just north of the road's terminus, until 2018, at Tualatin Valley Highway. History The road was built by Thomas R. Cornelius in the 19th century. The interchange with the Sunset Highway (US 26) was rebuilt and widened in 1989, and the road widened to five lanes from the freeway to Cornell Road the following year. In 1996, the road was extended southward when 216th and 219th avenues were renamed and became the southern section of the road, terminating at Tualatin Valley Highway. At that time, the intersection with Baseline Road was re-aligned, but most of the extension was simply a renaming of 216th Avenue. The intersection with US 26 was altered in 2005 with new on- and off-ramps extending from Cornelius Pass to the east, where a railroad overpass had previously been located. In 2008, the entire Multnomah County section was changed to a no- passing zone on the winding road over the Tualatin Mountains. New southern terminus in July 2018 A one-mile section from Lois to Wilkins streets closed for eight months in 2010 in order to widen the road in that area to five lanes as well as add bike lanes and sidewalks. The $12 million project included a new bridge over Beaverton Creek. The county hoped to widen the remaining portion of the road to five lanes between Walbridge/Aloclek and Wilkins. Announced in 2011, the expected cost was $10.1 million and would include a new bridge over Rock Creek. Construction closed the section for six months, with the new bridge opening on December 31, 2012; at that time, the remaining widening was expected to continue until the middle of 2013. Hillsboro also began preliminary work in 2011 to extend Cornelius Pass south of Tualatin Valley Highway to prepare for the development of South Hillsboro. The Oregon Legislature approved $9.5 million in 2012 to fund safety improvements such as guardrails. Hillsboro also announced plans in 2012 to widen the road to seven lanes between Cornell and US 26. The widening project was completed in March 2017 at a total cost of $18.3 million. Construction began in 2016 on the extension of Cornelius Pass Road south of Tualatin Valley Highway. The extension, approximately one-third of a mile long, was opened to traffic in July 2018. The new section crosses Portland & Western Railroad tracks and takes Cornelius Pass Road into the under-construction South Hillsboro area. The street currently ends at its intersection with an also-newly built section of SE Blanton Street. In July 2019, a five-mile stretch of Cornelius Pass Road between US 30 and NW Germantown Road began an 11-week closure. This stretch of road had experienced a high rate of crashes in preceding years, and Multnomah County closed the road so that safety improvements could be carried out, including curve realignment and widening of shoulders.

An old name in the county, Horden had been spelt a number of ways, including Hordern and Hordin.  Early history  Sir Thomas Conyers, 9th Baronet (died 1810)Between 1099 and 1133 the then Bishop of Durham, Ralph Flambard, granted lands at Sockburn, in County Durham and Hutton, in the North Riding of Yorkshire, to a Roger de Conyers. By the end of the 12th century the lands were divided between two branches of the Conyers family. The elder branch resided at Hutton Conyers, which passed to the Mallory family in 1347 after a Conyers daughter married a Mallory. The other branch was well established at Sockburn. Sockburn Hall was the family seat. The last male Conyers at Sockburn died in 1635, and his granddaughter sold the manor of Sockburn. Horden Hall In the 16th century Richard Conyers of Hornby, a descendant of Sir Christopher Conyers of Sockburn, married the heiress of the Horden estate near Peterlee, County Durham, and Horden Hall became the family seat. The 2nd Baronet married Elizabeth Langhorne, heiress to an estate at Charlton, Kent and his son, the 3rd Baronet inherited that estate in 1714. The 3rd Baronet had however married the Baldwin heiress to an estate at Great Stoughton, Huntingdonshire, in 1675 and moved the family seat there. After the death of the 4th Baronet without a male heir, the Horden estate was sold and the Charlton estate passed by entail out of the immediate family. The baronetcy passed to his cousin, Ralph Conyers of Chester le Street, who was a great grandson of the first Baronet. He married Jane Blakiston (d.1774) on 11 June 1719 at Durham Cathedral ‚Äì Jane being a scion of the \\"opulent House of Gibside\\", near Rowlands Gill. This alliance of the family with the Gibside-Bowes further \\"elevated their position and grandeur\\". The sons of Sir Ralph and Lady Conyers succeeded as the 6th and 7th Baronets, their grandson George as the 8th Baronet who upon his death, left the baronetcy to be inherited by Thomas, their third son; Sir Thomas was the 9th and last Baronet. Sir Thomas Conyers, 9th Baronet Sir Thomas, the ninth Baronet, seems to have retained his bearing as a gentleman; he is described as \\"gentleman\\" at his marriage in 1754 and as \\"esquire\\" in the baptismal entries of his daughters. According to Burke's Vicissitudes of Families, Durham historian Robert Surtees called on him at a Durham workhouse and, distressed at his plight, offered to raise an appeal to alleviate his circumstances. Sir Thomas replied: \\"I am no beggar, Sir; I won't accept any such offers.\\" His pride extended to the rejection of financial aid from his family. Although on 10 May 1800, he had attended Westminster Abbey for the funeral of his Gibside heiress cousin, Mary Eleanor Bowes - acknowledged as the wealthiest woman in England \\\\- he accepted no aid from his relatives at Gibside, the coal-rich estate in the Derwent Valley, County Durham, that his ancestor, Sir William Blakiston had owned. Eventually, Surtees was modestly successful in his appeal for funds and Sir Thomas Conyers was moved to more comfortable accommodation in a private house on 1 March 1810. The fate of Sir Thomas' brother was, according to the 1809 Gentleman's Magazine, somewhat better; Sir Blakiston Conyers (d.1791), was the \\"heir of two ancient titles, from which he derived little more than his name\\". But whereas the acceptance of the \\"generous patronage\\" of his Gibside relatives, the Bowes-Lyon family, had ensured that Sir Blakiston's situation was considerably more comfortable, his brother, Sir Thomas, died a pauper on 15 April 1810 - only months after having been rescued from the workhouse by his gentry friends. Sir Thomas Blakiston Conyers, the great great grandson of the first Baronet Conyers, failed to sire a surviving male heir and had only three daughters : Jane, Elizabeth and Dorothy. Sir Bernard Burke, in his 1861 work \\"Vicissitudes of Families\\", presents a chapter entitled \\"The Fall of Conyers\\" which concludes with the following: \\"Magni stat nominis umbra! The poor Baronet left three daughters, married in very humble life: Jane, to William Hardy; Elizabeth, to Joseph Hutchinson; and Dorothy, to Joseph Barker, all working men in the little town of Chester-le-Street. A time may yet come, perchance, when a descendant of one of these simple artizans may arise, not unworthy of the Conyers' ancient renown; and it will be a gratifying discovery to some future genealogist, when he succeeds in tracing in the quarterings of such a descendant the unsullied bearing of Conyers of Durham.\\" The baronetcy of Conyers of Horden became extinct in 1810. Sir Thomas' daughter, Jane Hardy, was reported as being a direct ancestor of Carole Middleton, mother of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge.

Early life Murphy was born in County Wexford, Ireland, and as an adult moved to the United States. He enlisted in the United States Army, from 1851-55, and re-enlisted in 1856. After he was discharged in 1861, he ventured to Santa Fe, New Mexico, and reenlisted once again in the Union Army. He served for the duration of the Civil War but saw little, if any, combat. He mustered out at Fort Stanton in 1866 and quickly joining the Grand Army of the Republic which united Union Army veterans as auxiliaries of the Republican Party in Reconstruction America. He established relationships with other well-connected G.A.R. members and went into business with German immigrant Emil Fritz. Due to Murphy's connections, the partners immediately began securing military contracts to supply beef, vegetables, and other supplies to the Apache Reservation. They then hatched schemes to sell land they didn't own to unsuspecting farmers. He eventually moved to Lincoln County, New Mexico, and in 1869 he started \\"L. G. Murphy & Co.\\" By 1873, he had hired fellow Irish immigrant James Dolan, who by 1874 had become a business partner in a profitable mercantile and banking operation. The business saw success mainly due to there being no competition. Murphy also became influential within law enforcement circles, and had an alliance with the Lincoln County Sheriff, William J. Brady. Lincoln County War What would become known as the Murphy-Dolan faction charged local farmers and ranchers high prices for their goods, causing them to be resented by many local people. To counter them, rancher John Tunstall and former Murphy-Dolan lawyer Alexander McSween opened a rival business in 1876, called \\"J. H. Tunstall & Co\\". The Tunstall-McSween faction had the support of powerful rancher John Chisum, and the business enraged James Dolan. With Murphy's support, Dolan hired gunmen to try to goad Tunstall into a fight, employing the Seven Rivers Warriors, the Jesse Evans Gang and the John Kinney Gang. The gangs began rustling Tunstall's herds or dispersing them which prompted Tunstall to form a gang called the Lincoln County Regulators, which included Dick Brewer, Doc Scurlock, Billy the Kid, and Charlie Bowdre. On February 18, 1878, while Tunstall was alone, he was shot and killed by Jesse Evans, William Morton, Frank Baker and Tom Hill, likely under the orders of Dolan. This event sparked the Lincoln County War, one of the best known range wars. To counter Sheriff Brady's lack of action on the murder, McSween took command of the Regulators, having them legally deputized, and tasked with the apprehension of the murderers. On March 6, 1878, the Regulators captured Morton and Baker. On March 9, 1878, the Regulators executed both men as well as William McCloskey, a fellow Regulator suspected of being a traitor. On April 1, 1878, the Regulators ambushed and murdered Sheriff Brady and Deputy George W. Hindman. This assassination, according to Robert Marshall Utley, had been ordered by McSween, who had learned that the Sheriff was carrying an arrest warrant for him. As the Sheriff lay dead, Billy the Kid ran from the place of ambush in order to remove the arrest warrant from Brady's pocket. Instead, he was driven back and slightly wounded by the gunfire of one of Brady's Deputies. Several other killings following this were committed by both the Regulators and the gunmen employed by Murphy-Dolan. The range war culminated in the Battle of Lincoln from July 15‚Äì19, 1878. Death By that time Murphy was in poor health, suffering from cancer. He was, by this time, having little to do with the day-to-day activities of his businesses or the gunmen under his employ. He died on October 20, 1878, around the age of 47.

The goal was securing the land and assessing its feasibility for agriculture. The founding was preceded by a complex land purchase procedure, as the British authorities had practically prohibited Jewish land acquisition in the area following the costly Arab Revolt and the subsequent White Paper of 1939. These lookouts, Revivim, Gvulot, and Beit Eshel, later served as a springboard for further Jewish population of the Negev. The residents of the lookouts made extensive geophysical surveys and conducted agricultural experiments for this purpose. History Historical background and early proposals The British White Paper of 1939 and the 1940 Land Transfer Regulations placed a number of restrictions on Jewish settlement and land purchase in the Mandate for Palestine. The Negev desert was one of the areas where both were forbidden. On the other hand, World War II had broken out and the Yishuv sought to broaden its areas of settlement in order to have greater capacity to house Jewish refugees from Europe. In general, the Yishuv, which was vehemently opposed to the White Paper, was interested in settling the Negev and conducting geological and hydrological surveys there. It also wished to test the British reaction to such a move. On April 29, 1942, a number of Yishuv notables, including Arthur Rupin, Eliezer Kaplan and Yosef Weitz, toured the area to determine its adequacy for settlement. While Rupin and Kaplan proposed creating a number of agricultural settlements in the area, Weitz rejected the idea and recommended the construction of three outposts‚Äîin the areas of Rafah, Beersheba and Bir 'Asluj‚Äîthat would each be located on a different type of soil and help determine the suitability of the surrounding area for agriculture and habitation. Weitz eventually proposed creating ten such outposts, that would each employ 10‚Äì12 workers living in a walled building. Eventually however, only three outposts were created, as per Weitz's original recommendation. Land purchase The land purchases in the Negev were made by the Jewish National Fund (JNF), operating as the Tzukerman Office, a private real estate company secretly affiliated with the JNF. If required to purchase land from Arabs (after 1940), the office would recruit Arabs who had allied themselves with the Yishuv, to circumvent the British ban. The land was mostly purchased from Negev Bedouin, who were usually not nationalistically motivated and more interested in the financial aspect. The JNF also set out to buy Jewish-owned land in the region, which was mostly unused. In 1936, this totalled 41,000 dunams (41 km2). Another policy was to consolidate the lands as much as possible and buy adjacent lots, in order to be able to settle the land later. In 1943, Weitz ordered Yoav Tzukerman to buy lands near Rafah/Khan Younis, in Wadi Shiniq (HaBesor Stream), and near 'Asluj and Beersheba. Lands were bought, but at the time the Bedouins in the area were enjoying relative prosperity and were less willing to sell. This significantly hurt the settlement plan for Gvulot, which called for the purchase of 5,000‚Äì6,000 dunams (5‚Äì6 km2). Founding The first settlement, Mitzpe Gvulot (today simply Gvulot) was established on May 12, 1943. The first squad numbered 12 people who came with a truck, four tents and a tractor. The group consisted of native Jews and a number of immigrants from Bulgaria from the Kibbutz HaShomer HaTzair Gimel organization. Most of those who planned to settle in Gvulot stayed in Rishon LeZion, and the lookout was managed from the moshava Beit Gan in the north of the country. Revivim was founded on July 28, 1943, by the organization HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed, and originally named Tel Tzofim. Three members came three months earlier, but were driven out by the British. On July 28, six people came to the site and started construction, soon joined by another six. Beit Eshel's first residents arrived on August 9, 1943‚Äîfour people with a tractor and two tents. An additional 36 people joined them later. The residents were immigrants from Austria and Germany, later joined by immigrants from Romania and native Jews. The group was called HaYogev (, lit. The Farmer) and were planning to set up a moshav. However, they were unable to do so due to lack of resources, and therefore organized as a kibbutz instead. Many of the early settlers, unable to adjust to the intense heat during the day, freezing temperatures at night, and plagues of mosquitoes, packed up and left. Those who remained built uniform settlements consisting of a square courtyard surrounded by walls, a watchtower, living quarters and service buildings. Logistics =Water supply= In the beginning, Gvulot got its water from nearby Arab villages. The price was 1 Palestine pound for 1 cubic meter, very high for the time. The cost of transport (done with a mule cart) was also high. In light of that, great effort was made to find an independent water source in the area. The first well, dug on July 21, 1943, turned up highly saline water. Five additional digs were made in 1943‚Äì1944, but turned out unsatisfactory. Tar-covered water collection ditches were also attempted, and helped ease the situation, but much water seeped through them into the ground, and additional filters had to be installed to make the water suitable for drinking. Although suitable water was found in Beit Eshel, it was too deep to extract effectively at the time; water was purchased from Beersheba. Only after World War II was Beit Eshel able to acquire a suitable pump. Eight wells were dug in Beit Eshel in total, two of them successful (another one was further east and saved for later). Mini-dams were built in the wadis around Beit Eshel for irrigation. A larger dam was planned for the Beersheba Stream, but nothing came of the project. In Revivim, a water well was purchased from the British administration, but its water was too saline. The workers then received free water from the British military base at Bir 'Asluj, until a new dig uncovered water at a depth of over 100 m and a tractor was modified to pump it out. A dam, the largest in the three lookouts at 1.2 m in height, was eventually built in Revivim. Three large reservoirs were also built in Revivim, with capacities of 40,000, 60,000 and 100,000 m3. They drained into the ground very quickly however. These projects represented the lion's share of the lookouts' expenditures, at over 70,000 Palestine pounds (compared to an annual budget of about 10,000 pounds for each lookout). By 1946, it had become clear that the three lookouts could not sustain an independent water supply. Also at that time, the Yishuv decided to create 11 additional settlements around the lookouts. In light of that, a decision was made that the water for these settlements would be provided by localities north of the Negev. However, budgets were also approved for additional wells and experiments in the existing villages. =Contact with the outside world= Beit Eshel's close proximity to Beersheba allowed it to receive superior communication services, such as a regular postal service (the letters were delivered to Beersheba) and a telephone line. The other lookouts communicated only through a pirate radio with the rest of the lookouts and the Haganah. Transportation of goods and people were done with the vehicles in the lookouts, which each had a van and sometimes a truck. When these were unavailable or could not be used, the residents of Revivim and Beit Eshel relied on outside means‚ÄîBritish vehicles traveling to and from the base at 'Asluj and public transport between Gaza and Beersheba, respectively. Gvulot was more isolated and while attempts were made to create a dirt road to Khan Yunis, in the end the residents had to take the route through Rafah. In rainy months, the lookouts were isolated in terms of transportation, especially Gvulot. Relations with non-Jewish elements The British Mandate authorities were ambivalent towards the founding of the lookouts. On the one hand, the Yishuv broke Mandatory law not just with the land purchases, but also with illegally holding weapons and operating illegal radios. On the other hand, there was no reason not to allow the Jews to attempt permanent settlement in the Negev, which was rare due to the Negev Bedouin's nomadic lifestyle. The local authorities took either a pro-Zionist or anti-Zionist stand depending on who headed them. The relationship with the British military were generally warm, especially in Revivim where some of the residents worked in the British base in 'Asluj and the British protected the area to prevent theft. Relations with the Bedouin were also mostly positive. The lookouts were in constant contact with the sheiks of the Azzazma and Tarabin tribes that ruled the area. Gvulot employed eight Bedouin guards. While economic ties were limited, the lookouts made an effort to keep warm social ties. Each lookout appointed a Mukhtar and kept Bedouin hospitality traditions. By contrast, relations with the fellaheen of the area were limited to negligible. Construction and development in 1943‚Äì1948 Other than the agricultural work, the lookouts' managers sought to create additional employment. In Beit Eshel, many of the residents were forced to move to Ness Ziona due to lack of jobs. Several factories were therefore built in the village, including a wool processing plant, a tin plant and a factory that manufactured construction materials. A cannery was built in Revivim. Gvulot planned to build a diamond processing plant, but the relevant equipment was destroyed in the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. Little non-agricultural development occurred during these years outside Beit Eshel. While Gvulot and Revivim each had over 100 members, only a few actually lived on the sites‚Äî12‚Äì14 in Gvulot and about 25 in Revivim. Despite this, the vast majority of these residents worked in the lookouts, something uncommon at the time. The residential areas of the lookouts were built as a castle‚Äîa two-floor stone building serving as a tower, with a 35 m2 courtyard surrounded by a stone wall. The tower served as the living quarters for up to 25 people, and the lookouts were encouraged not to build living quarters anywhere else for security reasons. However, this was disregarded in Beit Eshel as the need for additional living space arose. By 1947, security considerations trumped all others in plans for new constructions, not just in the lookouts, but also in most other settlements in the Negev. 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War Halutza. 19 November 1947 The first attack on one of the lookouts came in the civil war stage, on December 16, 1947, when local Bedouin attacked a vehicle between Halutza and Revivim. The British forces in the area refused to intervene. During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, beginning with an attack on May 17, 1948 by the Muslim Brotherhood, Beit Eshel was besieged by Egyptian forces and destroyed. When Beersheba was captured by the Israel Defense Forces in the Battle of Beersheba in 1948, the site was abandoned. Its inhabitants moved to the Jezreel Valley, establishing Moshav HaYogev. Geography The three lookouts are located in different parts of the Negev desert with different characteristics; Gvulot was founded close to Wadi Shiniq (Beersheba Stream), on a plateau 125 m above sea level. Gvulot's lands were heavily dispersed, going from Dangour in the west to Hazali in the east. The lands were mostly on sandy soil, being just north of expansive sand dunes. Beit Eshel was also built on a plateau, about 300 m above sea level, 3 km east of Beersheba, on loess soil. Revivim was built on a limestone hill surrounded by a plateau. The soil was a mix of sand and loess. Research and experiments conducted As intended, the founding of the lookouts led to a number of important scientific researches which assisted future Jewish agricultural settlement in the Negev desert. Scientific surveys An important geological survey was conducted in 1944‚Äì1945. The survey included 2,450 samples spread over 2.7 million dunams (2,700 km2). It concluded, among other things, that most of the Negev's soil was deeper than 2 m and of the loess type. The Hebrew University of Jerusalem conducted meteorological surveys. The only previous surveys had been done on a much smaller scale in police stations in the area in the 19th Century. They concluded that precipitation was higher in the northern Negev than in the southern, although the amount varied significantly from year to year, making it impossible to rely on the average amount. In addition, it was discovered that the proportion of rainfall in each month to the yearly average was different in the Negev than in other areas in Mandatory Palestine; in particular, there was a lot of rainfall in the month of May. The measurements also concluded that the amount of dew falling in the northern and western Negev was higher than in any other part of Mandatory Palestine. Research was also performed on the temperature, winds, air moisture and evaporation. Hydrological surveys were conducted by Leo Picard, who concluded that none of the three lookouts would serve as suitable locations for extracting ground water, which was either nonexistent or suffered from excessive salinity. The only potential drilling site for water, according to Picard, was on the coastal plain between Gaza and Rafah. This research provided a general direction for choosing which land to purchase in the future. Agricultural experiments A number of agricultural experiments were also conducted, which would pave the way for future agriculture in the arid region. In Beit Eshel, attempts were made to grow wheat, barley, oatmeal and legumes. It was concluded that growing these crops in the summer was not possible in that region, but the winter cultivation proved successful, by 1944 yielding 60 kg of wheat and 90 kg of barley per dunam (compared to 11.5 and 13.7, respectively, in the nearby Arab villages). A similar success was recorded in Gvulot, which yielded 61.5 kg of wheat, 75 kg of barkey, 86 kg of oatmeal and 98 kg of peas per dunam. Despite this, it was noted that 1944 was a rainy year and the yields could be lower in other years. By contrast, in Revivim, both winter and summer cultivations were reasonably successful, but the village was criticized for using rainwater that had been expensive to collect for large- scale farming, especially during the winter months. It was therefore unclear whether cereal farming in Revivim was financially feasible. Fruits and vegetables were also grown in the lookouts. In Revivim, vegetable harvests were rich, but much water was required to maintain the crops (275 m3 per dunam in for corn and 360 m3 for radish and beet), therefore making the venture unprofitable. Orchards were planted at low density (about 4 trees per dunam) of olives, peaches, apricots, almonds and pomegranates. Many of them froze in the winter or did not grow due to excessive water salinity. The most successful were dates, olives and pomegranates, which could grow on saline water. Forestry Trees were planted in the lookouts in order to shield the agricultural land from storms and moving sand. It was hoped that some of these would also turn a profit. In the years 1943‚Äì1948, about 500,000 seedlings were planted, with species including tamarix, eucalyptus, cypress and others.

With the winnings from this competition, Able put together The Able EP at a recording studio in Byron Bay, but shortly after releasing the EP in 2004, the band broke up and instead poured their efforts into Hillsong United.  Hillsong United  Munns' debut with the Hillsong United as their live recording drummer was in 1998 and played drums on seven live recordings until 2007 when he left to frontman the band LUKAS. As part of Hillsong United music team, Munns has toured in North America, South America, Africa, Europe and Asia. He has also contributed to seven of the main Hillsong album recordings as well, which are led by worship pastor Darlene Zschech. Songs he has written are sung in churches worldwide and have been translated into 32 languages, including Korean and German. He has helped write and produce many Hillsong songs including \\"Stay\\" on By Your Side (1999) and \\"Pour Out Your Spirit\\" on Best Friend (2000). Luke's unique style of worship drumming has brought worldwide influence to the sound of modern worship around the world and has been featured on Hillsong Music Australia albums that have quickly risen on both the Australian and American Christian music charts. In 2002 Munns designed the official UNITED logo which is still currently in use today and also designed the album artwork for Best Friend (2000), To the Ends of the Earth (2002) and More Than Life (2004).  Hillsong Kids  Luke is a music producer from The Lakehaus Studios working with Hillsong Kids Pastor David Wakerley and has been nominated for two dove awards for Children's Music Album of the Year for his music production work on Crazy Noise (2013), and Jesus Is My Super Hero (2006).  LUKAS  Photo of the band LUKAS In 2004 Luke pioneered the indie/folk band LUKAS and recorded six songs in his home studio. Since then the LUKAS Demo EP has had over 400,000 downloads worldwide. He then toured around Australia on a support solo tour with Australian/NZ folk artist Brooke Fraser and then went back into the studio to record the You & Me EP with producer Brendan Anthony (INXS, Midnight Oil, Jimmy Barnes, Brianna Carpenter (Australian Idol) in Studios 301, Sydney. Luke returned to his worship roots in 2006 and LUKAS transitioned into a worship and musician training movement, releasing their new singles \\"Shine Your Glory\\" and \\"Lost at Sea\\". The single's Abandoned featuring Australian electronic music producer and DJ Northie (2013), For God So Loved (2014), Heaven On The Earth (2014), all debuted at number one on iTunes Inspirational Charts, Australia, and Beauty For Ashes reached number five. Pastor Darlene Zschech commissioned Luke to write, record and release \\"For God So Loved\\" (2014) for Easter for their church HopeUC, based on the Central Coast, Australia. For God So Loved debuted at number one on the Australian Inspirational iTunes charts. LUKAS have toured in Australia, New Zealand, United States, Canada and Singapore, mainly holding worship encounter nights and church team training sessions, and have main staged Blackstump Festival, Big Exo Day, Parachute Festival and Hillsong Conference. They also performed Feels Like Home on MTV for the NOKIA Be Heard competition and placed 2nd out of all unsigned bands in Australia. Marking their 10th anniversary, LUKAS released a limited addition hard copy CD album of only 500 copies. Many past LUKAS members have gone on to become part of the main Hillsong Worship band and Hillsong United teams including Paul Mabury (drums), Harrison Wood (drums), Simon Kobler (drums) and Matt Hann (bass guitar). Former guitarist Christopher Whitehall left the band in 2006 to frontman the indie pop band The Griswolds. 24 January 2015, LUKAS recorded a live worship session at The Grove Studios, set for release late 2015, filmed and directed by cinematographer Paul Moss (Director of Photography for Masterchef, The Bachelor, Biggest Loser, Shark Tank).

Callington is situated on the Bremer River, and is adjacent to the South Eastern Freeway and the Adelaide-Wolseley railway line, however no trains have stopped at the station for many years. Callington is located within the state electoral district of Kavel and the federal division of Mayo.  History  Callington was surveyed in 1848, at which time John Kiernan noticed copper in the rocks. Callington was named after the copper mining town Callington in Cornwall, UK. The Callington Inn opened in 1851. Little copper was mined at first, before the miners followed the Victorian gold rush. Mining restarted a few years later in the Bremer Mine, digging the lode down until the water table was reached. In 1857 a forty-inch steam engine was installed to pump out of water per day. An even bigger pump was brought from Hallett Cove in 1859. In 1860‚Äì61, 150 workers were mining 250-300 tons of ore a month, which was smelted at Callington. Despite some good years, the Bremer Mine eventually fell into liquidation in 1870 due to low copper prices.  Demographics  Callington Primary School main building According to the 2006 census, Callington had 387 residents, almost half aged 25‚Äì54 years, and the median age was 34. Almost 90% of them were born in Australia.  Recreation  Callington is home to the Bremer Callington Cricket Club which plays in the Alexandra and Eastern Hills Cricket Association since the merger of the Bremer Cricket Club and the Callington Cricket Club in 1970. The Bridgewater Callington Raiders plays Australian rules football home matches at both Bridgewater and Callington in the Hills Football League.  Education  Callington has a kindergarten and a primary school in the town. Students need to travel to Mount Barker, Strathalbyn or Murray Bridge for high school.

One of the most iconic figures to emerge from 19th century children's literature, and one who is instantly recognized by her attire, is Alice in Wonderland.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865) by Charles Dodgson under the pseudonym Lewis Carroll Although many artists have depicted Alice in many different ways, the original illustrations by John Tenniel have become iconic through their subsequent repetition (with generally minimal alterations) in most published editions and film adaptations. The headband depicted by Tenniel became so linked to Alice that it gave rise to the term \\"Alice band\\".Chambers 21 Century Dictionary, rev. edn (Edinburgh: Chamber Harrap, 1999), s.v. Alice band.\\"Alice, n.1.\\" OED Online, Oxford University Press, March 2019, https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/4982. Accessed 24 March 2019.  Tenniel's Alice  Tenniel's black-and-white illustrations for Alice's Adventures in Wonderland depict Alice wearing a knee-length puffed sleeve dress with a pinafore worn over the top and ankle-strap shoes. In the analysis of Masafumi Monden, > Alice‚Äôs sense of agency is further conveyed by her dress‚Ä¶ Little girls‚Äô > dresses in mid- to late nineteenth-century Europe were, even with certain > restrictions, slightly more practical than adults‚Äô, and the dress Alice wore > in Tenniel‚Äôs illustrations was a fashion current to the time of the book > with a faint hint of the practical future ... Both the character and dress > of Alice thus point out that she is neither assertive nor passive but is > rather positioned comfortably in between the two. Lewis Carroll gave directions to Tenniel over some aspects of the dress. Tenniel's first design was intended to give Alice the look of a chess piece. However, Caroll instructed Tenniel not to give it \\"so much crinoline\\", a common component of women's dresses at the time. Tenniel also changed the dress from book to book. In Through the Looking Glass, he gave Alice striped horizontal stockings and her (now eponymous) headband. For The Nursery \\"Alice\\", he re-drew twenty of the illustrations, and brought Alice into line with contemporary fashion. He not only coloured the dress yellow (discussed in detail later) but added a second bow to Alice's hair, a bow to the apron, and pleats. The colour of Alice's dress 250px Neither the wording nor illustrations to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland indicated the colour of her clothes. In a popular stage version of the story, staged by Henry Saville Clarke in 1886‚Äì87, Alice's costume was white (a decision endorsed for the next production by Lewis Carroll). The first colourised versions of Tenniel's images were created for The Nursery \\"Alice\\", coloured under his supervision. In this edition, Alice's dress was yellow. Subsequent colourised versions of Tenniel's illustrations created for editions of the Alice books after Charles Dodgson's death and without the involvement of Tenniel have dressed Alice in different colours, including red, orange, and chartreuse. DeLoss McGraw's illustrations used a range of colours. One of the earliest editions, Macmillan's 1903 \\"Little Folks\\" edition, had her in a blue dress. Macmillan's deluxe 1911 edition, which featured colour plates based on Tenniel's illustrations painted by artist Harry Theaker, again had Alice in a blue dress. Other illustrators also retained the blue colour scheme, including Helen Oxenbury. The blue dress later became the most common and well-known version of Alice's dress, showing up often in print and filmed adaptations that take their inspiration from Tenniel's original illustrations (including Paramount's 1933 movie, Disney's 1951 movie, and the 1972 movie). Although some adaptations have chosen different colour schemes (for example, orange in the 1985 Irwin Allen production, yellow in the BBC's 1972 and 1986 adaptations as well as the 1999 Hallmark movie and lilac in The Royal Ballet's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland), the blue version has remained the most iconic version. Alice in other media Alice, in a 1948 Ladies' Home Journal advertisement It became fashionable for young girls to dress up as Alice when wearing fancy dress around the 1880s, by which time the fashion for everyday girls' dresses had changed enough that Alice's attire as depicted in the books had come to seem distinctive. Dresses explicitly inspired by Alice's were a recurrent feature of the range of the clothes makers Joseph Love, Inc. from the 1930s to the 1960s.Jennifer Farley Gordon, 'The Development of the Designer Children's Wear Industry, 1920-1969' (Ph.D. dissertation, Iowa State University, 2016), pp. 94-95. The style became especially popular in the USA when the Disney movie was released in 1951. More subtly, Alice's dress has been seen as an influence on Japanese dress styles, exhibited in music videos by, for example, Mizuki Alisa (in the video for her 1991 \\"Town of Eden\\"), Kawase Tomoko (\\"Bloomin‚Äô!\\", 2002) and Kimura Kae (\\"Snowdome\\", 2007).

It is a constellation of symptoms that indicate severe adrenal insufficiency caused by insufficient levels of the hormone cortisol. This may be the result of either previously undiagnosed or untreated Addison's disease, a disease process suddenly affecting adrenal function (such as bleeding from the adrenal glands in Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome), suddenly stopping intake of glucocorticoids or an intercurrent problem (e.g. infection, trauma, in fact any form of physical or mental stress) in someone known to have Addison's disease, congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), or other form of primary adrenal insufficiency. Signs and symptoms Characteristic symptoms are: * Sudden penetrating pain in the legs, lower back or abdomen * Confusion, psychosis, slurred speech * Severe lethargy * Convulsions * Fever * Hyperkalemia (elevated potassium level in the blood) * Hypercalcemia (elevated calcium level in the blood): the cause of hypercalcemia is a combination of increased calcium input into the extracellular space and reduced calcium removal by the kidney, this last caused by decreased glomerular filtration and increased tubular calcium reabsorption. Both renal factors are secondary to volume depletion and, in fact, improve rapidly during rehydration with saline infusion. * Hypoglycemia (reduced level of blood glucose) * Hyponatremia (low sodium level in the blood) * Hypotension (low blood pressure) * Hypothyroid (low T4 level) * Severe vomiting and diarrhea, resulting in dehydration * Syncope (transient loss of consciousness) and/or orthostatic hypotension (drop in blood pressure on standing, leading to loss of balance) Causes Adrenal crisis is caused by a deficiency of cortisol resulting from Addison's disease, congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), corticosteroid biosynthetic enzyme defects or pituitary disorders (such as Sheehan's syndrome, pituitary adenoma, hypopituitarism (inactive or underactive pituitary) causing failure to activate the adrenal glands. Diagnosis Various investigations aid the diagnosis: * ACTH (cosyntropin) stimulation test * Cortisol level (to assess the level of glucocorticoids) * Fasting blood sugar * Serum potassium (to assess the level of mineralocorticoids) * Serum sodium Prevention Adrenal crisis is triggered by physiological stress (such as trauma) or severe psychological stress. Activities that have an elevated risk of trauma are best avoided.

Much of their repertoire consisted of songs from the 1920s or 1930s. Other influences included music hall, blues and jug band music. Their eccentricity arose, not only from their characters and choice of music, but from an eclectic mix of instruments, some of them home- made, such as the 'egg-cupaphone' and the 'ballcockaphone' - a wind instrument in which the supply of air to the reed was controlled by a toilet cistern chain connected to a ballcock. History The \\"Piggies\\" (as they were affectionally known), derived their unusual name from a location in Bristol; the section of Gloucester Road between the old Bristol North swimming baths and the Horfield Prison turning. They are now considered to be an example of the so-called scrumpy and western musical genre. Based in the Bristol area, the band originally comprised Barry Back (born 10 April 1944, Bristol, died 2 April 1992), Dave 'The Crutch' Creech (born David Creech, 4 March 1938, Bristol), Andy Leggett (born Andrew Leggett, 31 March 1942, Much Wenlock, Shropshire) and John Turner (born 2 January 1947, Bristol). They are reputed to have got together after meeting at a new year's eve party organised by Fred Wedlock at the Troubadour Club in Clifton, Bristol. They later provided backing for Wedlock on his album, The Folker. Turner was previously in a group called The Downsiders Folk Group, Back and Leggett in The Alligator Jug Thumpers, and Creech in The Elastic Band. They quickly built up a strong local following and were soon playing gigs around the country. Their first album, The Pigsty Hill Light Orchestra Presents (abbreviated as PHLOP!) was the first release on The Village Thing label in 1970. They were joined on this album by Julie Bridson and Ian Hunt. Turner left the band after this album, and Bill Cole took his place as the fourth member of the band for their second album, Piggery Jokery, also on The Village Thing, in 1971. This album featured an early Rodney Matthews cover, and was recorded in front of an audience in Cornwall, resulting in an authentic recreation of their stage act. Back then left, being replaced by Jon 'Wash' Hays; Leggett left soon afterwards, leaving Creech the only survivor of the original line-up. Various personnel came and went; Dave Paskett (born David Paskett Smith, 3 June 1944, Potters Bar, Hertfordshire), Richie Gould, Pat Small and Henry Davies, plus guitarists Chris Newman (born Christopher Newman, 3 October 1952, Stevenage, Hertfordshire) and Robert Greenfield (born 14 May 1949, Norfolk) came on board plus, occasionally, the guitarist Diz Disley, all of whom appeared on the next album, The Pigsty Hill Light Orchestra, in 1976. The album received good reviews, including this one from the Melody Maker: \\"The Pigsty Hill Light Orchestra must be one of the most popular acts on the folk scene. Their spontaneous humour and good time songs have held many an audience anchored to the floor in wonder.\\" Despite continuing popularity, the band split up in May 1979 but, in 1988, reformed for the Trowbridge Village Pump Festival, after which Pat Small and singer Hannah Wedlock (Fred's daughter) joined the line-up and they began touring again. In 1991 they produced another album, Back on the Road Again and, in the same year, Jim Reynolds and Dave Griffiths joined the band. The following year, Musical History, a compilation album consisting of a selection of tracks taken from 1968 to 1992, was released. Back, who had been the driving force behind the \\"Piggies\\" reunion, died on 10 April 1992 and, shortly after, the band decided to pack up for good. Founder member Dave Creech died of cancer on 4 May 2011. Little more than a month earlier he was still performing regularly with various local bands.

He was raised on Long Island and graduated from Willams College in Massachusetts. He became interested in the Democratic Party politics while studying at Williams College in the early 1950s. Career John Westergaard began his Wall Street career as an analyst for Standard & Poor's, the securities rating service. In 1960 he opened a research firm with his friend, William Prime. Their company, Equity Research Associates, offered analytical services to small brokerage firms that could not afford research departments. This business was later acquired by Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company, a brokerage firm. In the 1980s, Westergaard founded the Westergaard Fund, a mutual fund that focused on finding emerging companies. However, the firm was not as successful as stocks of small companies generally lagged the market during the bull market of the early and mid-1980s. Westergaard funds closed during November 1987. Westergaard continued to publish research via a mailed - and later faxed - newsletter available to subscribers. Westergaard eventually moved his publishing to the Internet, starting a Web site devoted to small company stocks. He was the host of an investment radio show, Johnny Dotcom's Journal, where he interviewed executives of start up companies, and offered a service to companies in which he tried to monitor electronic rumor mongers and to counteract the stories they spread. Westergaard also served as treasurer for Daniel Patrick Moynihan from the earliest days of his political career through four Senate campaigns. Westergaard agreed to serve as Moynihan's campaign treasurer when he ran for New York City Council president.

Along with Demetrio Vallejo, he was considered one of the leaders of the 1958 railway strikes. Campa was also the founder of the National Railroad Council, and the defunct underground newspaper The Railwayman. Communist Party Campa was born in Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n, and joined the Mexican Communist Party ( in 1927 at the age of 25; eventually becoming the youngest member of the parties Central Committee. Campa's views would eventually draw the ire of the party. In March 1940, he was expelled from the PCM along with the party Secretary General, Hern√°n Laborde. The two, along with others in the party, were removed due to their views that the assassination of Leon Trotsky should wait. Campa believed the killing of Trotsky would make him a martyr and only blacken the message of the party. In 1976, Campa was chosen as the presidential candidate for the PCM. The PCM was not certified to run an electoral candidate, however it is rumored Campa garnered approximately one million votes. The count was never reported since the PRI candidate, Jos√© L√≥pez Portillo, ran officially unopposed. Campa's campaign was supported by the Socialist League and . The campaign was called \\"The March for Democracy\\" by supporters and bore the slogan \\"Campa, Candidate of the Workers Struggle.\\" Campa supported, and discussed in the 97 political meetings he attended over the three-month race, priests' political rights, academic freedom, and democracy within the Mexican army. While the campaign, due to its unofficial structure, ran without media access, it is calculated over 100,000 people attended the political meetings held by Campa, and over 10,000 people in support of Campa, attended the closing event at the Arena M√©xico in the nation's capital. CTM/STFRM Campa was a member of the Executive Committee of the Union of Railroad Workers of the Mexican Republic () from 1943 to 1947. In 1944 a split began to develop within the party and the president was asked to step and assist in a compromise. Luis G√≥mez Zepeda was chosen as secretary general and Campa was elected to serve as Secretary of Education, Organization and Propaganda. In 1947, Campa lead a breakaway faction within the Confederation of Mexican Workers () called the Special Confederation of Workers (). The new labor confederation included telephonists, railroad workers, miners and oil workers. The goal of the CUT was to be an independent labor movement, devoid of government influence it alleged plagued the CTM. The following year, in 1948, Jes√∫s D√≠az de Le√≥n was elected to the position of STFRM secretary general. On 28 September, D√≠az de Le√≥n filed a petition with the Attorney General against Campa and G√≥mez Zepeda, who he felt were a \\"communist menace,\\" on charges of embezzlement of 100,000 pesos. The union was outraged at the actions of D√≠az de Le√≥n, particularly on the grounds that such charges are to be presented to the unions vigilance committee. The union's general accounting committee followed suit, condemning D√≠az de Le√≥n's actions as having solicited the government into the unions affairs. The union's executive committee and vigilance committee release statements accusing D√≠az de Le√≥n of \\"wanting to divide the union in complicity with the government\\" and temporarily suspended him, placing Francisco Quintano Madrazo in his place. D√≠az de Le√≥n however rallied his supporters, appearing at the headquarters of the STFRM, along with an estimated one hundred secret police officers dressed as railway workers. The supporters assaulted the STFRM headquarters, and their actions were directed from the rear by his grandfather, Senator Colonel Serrano, from a jeep and speaker system attached to a military truck. By 8 October, local newspapers were running stories stating Campa and G√≥mez were wanted by the Federal Judicial Police. Campa was eventually detained as well as members of the executive and vigilance committee, by the judicial police on charges of transferring 200,000 pesos to Campa's break off group CUT. Campa maintained and provided proof that the actions were accounted for and proper permission granted. Campa went underground and protested the charges, stating he earned only 575 pesos a month in his position and owned no house, car, or even business and could not have benefited personally. Campa avoided arrest until November 1949 and was then sentenced to eight years on the charge of fraud, he was held until 1952 at Lecumberri Prison. Strikes of 1959 In February 1959, the previous collective contract for the railroad unions had lapsed and a deadline for a new contract was fast approaching. On 24 March, the strike officially began as all three of the railway enterprises, The Pacific, Mexican Railways, and Veracruz Terminal began work stoppages. The railway officials refused to acknowledge the strike and ordered the union members to return to work. On 26 March, the railway officials began to fire employees, over 13,000 in total, with many arrested. In protest, the STFRM held a one-hour complete work stoppage and general strike. On Good Friday, 27 March, a proposal was presented directly to President, Adolfo L√≥pez Mateos, the demands being reduced to payment on the seventh day of rest and a swift end to the repression. The president began to stall as over 100,000 people were on strike and estimated millions of pesos were lost. On 28 March, Vallejo was kidnapped along with 28 others by the Federal Police and the army. The government mobilized several battalions of troops, fired another 9,000 workers and arrested over 10,000. The arrests spread beyond railway workers to professors, peasants and Marxist-Leninist activists. Campa was wanted by authorities for his role in leading the strikes. On 3 April Gilberto Rojo Robles, deputy to Vallejo, issued a notice to all workers to return to work on the basis a deal was made, however no such agreement came to pass. Rojo Robles was soon after arrested along with Alberto Lumbreras, and Miguel Aroche Parra of the POCM and Dionisio Encina, secretary for the PCM. Campa, however, would remain at large, directing railroad strikes for a year. While in hiding, Campa founded the National Railroad Council in 1959 and started an underground newspaper titled The Railwayman. In May 1960, Campa was finally arrested and imprisoned. It would be ten years after their eleven-year sentence before Vallejo and Campa would eventually be released. The rising student movement had succeeded in pressuring Gustavo D√≠az Ordaz to repeal the law against \\"social dissolution.\\" On 27 July 1970, Campa and Vallejo were released. Following Vallejos release he refused to join Campa in the National Railroad Council, instead opting to found his own group, Railwaymen's Union Movement (MSF).

Enols, hydroxamic acids, oximes, and sulfinic acids give positive results as well. The bromine test is useful to confirm the result, although modern spectroscopic techniques (e.g. NMR and IR spectroscopy) are far superior in determining the identity of the unknown. The quantity of total phenols may be spectroscopically determined by the Folin‚ÄìCiocalteau assay.  Technique  The sample is dissolved in water, or a mixture of water and ethanol, and a few drops of dilute ferric chloride (FeCl3) solution is added. The formation of a red, blue, green, or purple coloration indicates the presence of phenols. Where the sample is insoluble in water, it may be dissolved in dichloromethane with a small amount of pyridine.  Chemistry  Phenols form a complex with ferric ions.

If the elasticity of demand is greater than 1, it is a luxury good or a superior good. * A zero income elasticity of demand occurs when an increase in income is not associated with a change in the demand of a good. Income elasticity of demand can be used as an indicator of future consumption patterns and as a guide to firms' investment decisions. For example, the \\"selected income elasticities\\" below suggest that an increasing portion of consumers' budgets will be devoted to purchasing automobiles and restaurant meals and a smaller share to tobacco and margarine.Frank, Robert (2008). p. 125 Income elasticities are closely related to the population income distribution and the fraction of the product's sales attributable to buyers from different income brackets. Specifically when a buyer in a certain income bracket experiences an income increase, their purchase of a product changes to match that of individuals in their new income bracket. If the income share elasticity is defined as the negative percentage change in individuals given a percentage increase in income bracken the income-elasticity, after some computation, becomes the expected value of the income-share elasticity with respect to the income distribution of purchasers of the product. When the income distribution is described by a gamma distribution, the income elasticity is proportional to the percentage difference between the average income of the product's buyers and the average income of the population.Bordley and McDonald.  Mathematical definition  :\\\\epsilon_d = \\\\frac{\\\\%\\\\ \\\\mbox{change in quantity demanded}}{\\\\%\\\\ \\\\mbox{change in income}} More formally, the income elasticity of demand, \\\\ \\\\epsilon_d, for a given Marshallian demand function Q(I,\\\\vec{P}) , with arguments income and a vector of prices of all goods, for arbitrarily small changes in price and quantity of a good is :\\\\epsilon_d = \\\\frac{\\\\partial Q}{\\\\partial I}\\\\frac{I}{Q} This can be rewritten in the form :\\\\epsilon_d = \\\\frac{d \\\\ln Q}{d \\\\ln I} For discrete changes the elasticity is :\\\\epsilon_d={\\\\Delta Q \\\\over \\\\Delta I} \\\\times {(I_1 + I_2)/2 \\\\over (Q_1 + Q_2)/2}={\\\\Delta Q \\\\over \\\\Delta I}\\\\times {I_1 + I_2 \\\\over Q_1 + Q_2}, where subscripts 1 and 2 refer respectively to values before and after the change. Necessity goods have an income elasticity of demand between zero and one: expenditure on these goods increases with income, but not as fast as income does, so the proportion of expenditure on these goods falls as income rises. This observation for food is known as Engel's law. Types of income elasticity of demand There are five possible income demand curves: *High income elasticity of demand: In this case, increase in income is accompanied by relatively larger increase in quantity demanded. *Unitary income elasticity of demand: In this case, increase in income is accompanied by same proportionate increase in quantity demanded. *Low income elasticity of demand: In this case, increase in income is accompanied by less than proportionate increase in quantity demanded. *Zero income elasticity of demand: This shows that quantity bought is constant regardless of changes in income. *Negative income elasticity of demand: In this case, increase in income is accompanied by decrease in quantity demanded.

The trust is a non-profit organization with its headquarters in Seattle, Washington. The present total population of snow leopards in the wild is estimated at between 3,920 and 6,390.  History  The trust was founded in 1981 by Helen Elaine Freeman (March 10, 1932 ‚Äì September 20, 2007). Working as a volunteer at Seattle's Woodland Park Zoo, Freeman became fascinated with the snow leopards there and learned about their endangered plight. She later joined the staff of the zoo and was motivated to set up the trust to protect the snow leopard in the wild, and its habitat. She also began the trust‚Äôs philosophy of helping the people sharing the snow leopard‚Äôs habitat improve their standard of living in exchange for protecting the animal.Peterson, Alison J. \\"Helen E. Freeman, protector of snow leopards, is dead at 75\\", New York Times, 2007-10-01  Snow leopard conservation programs  The trust performs scientific research projects, manages community-level conservation programs, and fosters global collaboration amongst snow leopard experts and other snow leopard support groups. The organization raises money through donations, grants, fundraising events and sales of products on its website shop, and is supported by zoos and other conservation organizations. The Snow Leopard Trust is recognized as a 4-star charity by Charity Navigator,http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid;=7393 and is a member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), European Association of Zoos and Aquariums (EAZA), World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA), International Species Information System (ISIS) and Co-Op America. Currently, the Snow Leopard Trust focuses its efforts in five snow leopard range countries: China, India, Mongolia, Pakistan, and Kyrgyzstan. In these countries, the trust employs and trains staff to carry out research, education, and conservation. In the seven other countries within the snow leopard range, the trust supports and collaborates with researchers and conservation organizations.  Community-based conservation  Co-operation with communities in snow leopard range countries forms the basis of the trust's on-the-ground conservation work. When a region has been identified as a place of significant snow leopard habitat, the trust works with local residents to understand their needs and then jointly develop conservation programs. These conservation programs must meet four important goals - # the protection of snow leopards and their habitat, involving local communities in this effort # an improved quality of life for the members of the community # the program developed must have a path to becoming self-sufficient so long term it is not dependent on donor dollars # the results of the program must be verifiable through monitoring programs. Snow Leopard Enterprises (SLE) is one of the trust‚Äôs major community programs. Over 300 families in Mongolia, Kyrgyzstan and Pakistan participate by making handicraft products from the wool of their livestock to increase their income in return for helping protect the snow leopard in their region.Misra, Julie \\"Saving the snow leopard.\\" The E:Environmental Magazine (May‚ÄìJune 2005). The families have all agreed to stop hunting snow leopards and prey species while also helping with anti-poaching activities. At the end of each year, communities receive a bonus when no poaching has occurred. In 2011, the program won the BBC World Challenge, a global competition aimed at finding projects from around the world that have shown enterprise and innovation at a grass roots level.https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/worldnews/301111winner.html  Science and research  Many open question remain on the biology and behavior of the snow leopard. In order to answer these questions and design conservation programs accordingly, The Snow Leopard Trust conducts and supports snow leopard research. The following are some of the trust‚Äôs most current and impactful studies. In 2008, the trust launched a long-term (10+ year) research project to take place in Mongolia‚Äôs South Gobi Province. Although there have been several valuable studies of the species to date, most were short-term, or at most four or five years in duration. The aim of this project is to study all aspects of snow leopard ecology, and researchers will employ a variety of methods including trap cameras and GPS radio collaring. The trust has established a base camp in the Tost Mountains, approximately 250 km west of the provincial capital of Dalanzadgad, and in the first wave of researchers were scientists from Argentina, Mongolia, the United States and Sweden. A total of 18 snow leopards have been equipped with GPS tracking collars. This major study is a joint project of the Snow Leopard Trust and the Snow Leopard Conservation Foundation (Mongolia) and is carried out in partnership with Mongolia‚Äôs Ministry of Nature, Environment and Green Development and the Mongolia Academy of Sciences, Nordens Ark, Grimso and the Whitley Fund for Nature. Prior to the launch of this long-term study, trust scientists captured a female snow leopard (named Bayad) in Chitral Gol National Park in northern Pakistan on 17 November 2006, fitting her with a GPS satellite collar in order to accurately collect detailed knowledge regarding the species‚Äô movements and home range size.http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/where_we_work/asia_pacific/where/pakistan/index.cfm?uNewsID=87820 This was the first-ever study of wild snow leopards using GPS radio technologyhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6188482.stm and was conducted by the Snow Leopard Trust in conjunction with Pakistan‚Äôs North West Frontier Province Wildlife Department and WWF‚ÄìPakistan. Bayad is known to many from footage in the BBC‚Äôs Planet Earth and Natural World documentaries, and Mutual of Omaha‚Äôs Wild Kingdom series on Animal Planet. Bayad‚Äôs movements were tracked for a total of 14 months, and yielded more data than has ever been gathered using conventional VHF radio collars. In particular, researchers found that she traveled a 1,563 km2 area, splitting her time between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Through its Indian partner NGO, Nature Conservation Foundation, and in collaboration with the Himachal Pradesh Forest Department, the trust will launch a similar, long-term snow leopard study in Spiti Valley, India, in the fall of 2014.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/developmental- issues/HP-to-launch-snow-leopard-research-conservation-facility-in- Spiti/articleshow/29174501.cms In 2006, in co-operation with geneticists Dr. Lisette Waits of the Laboratory for Ecological and Conservation Genetics at the University of Idaho and Dr. Warren Johnson of the Laboratory of Genomic Diversity, the Snow Leopard Trust identified several spots on the cats' DNA (microsatellite loci) that have enough variation to tell individual cats apart. With this discovery it is possible to test feces and hair specimens found in the field and identify individual cats.  Partnerships and collaboration  When working in snow leopard range countries, the Snow Leopard Trust works with the following conservation organizations/NGOs: Snow Leopard Foundation (Pakistan), Snow Leopard Conservation Foundation (Mongolia), Nature Conservation Foundation (India), Snow Leopard Foundation (Kyrgyzstan) and Shan Shui Conservation Center (China). The trust developed the Snow Leopard Information Management System (SLIMS) which now facilitates knowledge sharing of snow leopard research results around the world. In 2013, the Snow Leopard Trust was a key technical partner and co-organizer of the Global Snow Leopard Conservation Forum, a gathering of all 12 snow leopard range countries jointly organized by the Office of the President of the Kyrgyz Republic Almazbek Atambayev and the State Agency on Environmental Protection and Forestry under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. At the forum, held in Bishkek, Kyrgyz Republic, officials and conservationists discussed urgent actions and a new global strategy to address conservation of the endangered snow leopard and its habitat in the critical ecosystems of Central Asia; culminating in the adoption of the Bishkek Declaration on the Conservation of the Snow Leopard and the Global Snow Leopard Ecosystem Recovery Program (GSLEP).http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2013/10/23/countries- converge-in-kyrgyz-republic-for-new-global-initiative-to-conserve-the-snow- leopard-and-high-mountain-ecosystems The trust continues to support the range countries in the implementation of the GSLEP.  Snow Leopard Network  The trust supports the Snow Leopard Network (SLN), a collaborative network of organisations and government agencies from all over the globe working on snow leopard conservation. The SLN was started in 2002 at the Snow Leopard Survival Summit in Seattle, Washington, United States, as a means for snow leopard conservationists to co-operate on research and to address the challenges impacting the snow leopard‚Äôs survival while ensuring the livelihood opportunities of local people in snow leopard regions.Snow Leopard Network The SLN produced the Snow Leopard Survival Strategy (SLSS) a report which presents a co-ordinated strategy for ensuring the endangered cat‚Äôs survival.  Collaboration with zoos and other conservation organizations  The Snow Leopard Trust works with zoos and other conservation organisations worldwide, facilitating international conservation co-operation. In March 2008, the Snow Leopard Trust, WCS, the Snow Leopard Network, and Panthera Foundation organized an international conference in Beijing, China to bring together representative from all snow leopard range countries for the first time. Leading conservationists and researchers, as well as government officials from 11 of the 12 snow leopard range countries were among the more than 100 conference attendees. Dr. George Schaller, one of the first people to ever study snow leopards, and Dr. Urs Breitenmoser, co-Chair of the IUCN Cat Specialist Group, delivered keynote address. Outputs of the conference include an updated map of snow leopard range, country-specific action plans and three resolutions. # All range countries should expedite development of a Snow Leopard Action Plan, or implement existing plans to the fullest extent. # Each country will designate a national snow leopard focal point from a relevant institution to coordinate with the Snow Leopard Network and other focal points for the exchange of information at the national and international level. # Range state governments will develop mechanisms (e.g., Memoranda of Understanding) to promote transboundary cooperation on matters such as trade, research and management relevant to snow leopard conservation that include, inter alia, the impacts of climate change on distribution and long-term survival of snow leopards, and where possible incorporate positive actions within conservation programs (e.g., carbon neutral projects). Zoos also have an important role to play in snow leopard conservation. More than 50 zoos worldwide participate in the Snow Leopard Trust‚Äôs Natural Partnerships Program. There are many ways that zoos can be involved in the Natural Partnerships Program, including selling Snow Leopard Enterprises merchandise through their gift shops, offering joint membership agreements, hosting Snow Leopard Trust speakers, and displaying educational materials. The signature element of the Natural Partnerships Program is the opportunity for zoos to get directly involved with the trust's conservation programs in the snow leopard's range countries.http://www.snowleopard.org/partners/zoos  Grants program  Conservationists and educators working on the ground in snow leopard countries often have limited resources and the grants program will support them in any projects that meet the needs identified in the Snow Leopard Survival Strategy (SLSS).

Presence of unsaturation and/or phenol or aniline in the sample is shown by disappearance of the deep brown coloration of bromine when it has reacted with the unknown sample. The formation of a brominated phenol (i.e. 2,4,6-tribromophenol) or aniline(i.e. 2,4,6-tribromoaniline) in form of a white precipitate indicates that the unknown was a phenol or aniline.

He also participates in international competitions : Ultra Trail du Mont Blanc, Pierre Menta, Enduro du Touquet, 100 km de Millau, IronMan, etc.  September 2020: Manaslu  Charles Hedrich is aiming to ski from 8,163 metres above sea level. Manaslu is the eight highest peak in the world. Located in the Gorkha District, it is the highest peak of the region.  Biography  In 2008 Charles founded the association Respectons la Terre to promote adventure Sport and exploration across the world. He did his military service in St Cyr, Co√´tquidan. He became Chief of Combat Section at the 13th Battalion of Modane Alpine Chasseurs. alt= Sales Director for 13 years, he created his company in France, then developed in Europe and the United States. Initial public offering in 1997, he sold his share of the company in 2001. He then became passionate about adventure sports. In 2003, he finished sixth in the category (motorcycles under 400 cm3). Also in 2003, he finished the Calais Round Britain Race and broke the race record for the Dover-Calais crossing. In 2004, he announced his intention to participate in the 2004-2005 Vend√©e Globe. A dispute with the owner of his boat led him to make the decision to go off- race. He will finish the tour solo, non-stop trip in 122 days. In 2006, he climbed Everest by the Tibetan route. In 2007, he set a new world record for rowing across the Atlantic Ocean between Dakar (Senegal) and Guara Point (Brazil). In December 2007, he tried to beat B√∏rge Ousland's speed record by reaching the South Pole from Berkner Island (total distance: 1,310 km) alone and in full autonomy. He suffered from a urinary tract infection that forced him to stop after 550 kilometres. In 2009, together with Arnaud Tortel, achieved a world premiere: the autonomous crossing from the North Pole to Greenland without refuelling in 62 days. In the same year, he sailed solo from Upernavik to Resolute Bay on the Glory of the Sea and then sailed the Northwest Passage to the Aleutian Islands with a crew member. In June 2010, the boat reached the port of Arsenal in Paris where it stopped for a few months. In 2010, he went on a ski and mountaineering expedition to Afghanistan with Nadjib Sirat, the first Afghan on Mont Blanc. They skied 20 kilometres from Kabul and mountaineered in Panshire. Nadjib Sirat then created the first Afghan ski and mountaineering federation. In 2011, he participates in international competitions of reference: Pierra menta in March ( finished 161st with Marc Rosaz ), Ironman de Nice in June (finished in 13 h 05 min 44 s) and Ultra-trail du Mont-blanc in August (finished in 44 h 28 min 48 s). In the autumn of 2012, he achieved a world premiere: the round-trip crossing of the North Atlantic Ocean. He rowed for 145 days and covered 11,000 km between Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon and Martinique. Summer 2013 in another rowing premiere: he rowed Northwest Passage solo, 6000 km across the Arctic Ocean with a 160 kg carbon kevlar prototype. Season 1: Charles Hedrich leaves the Bering Strait on July 1, 2013, paddles along all the coasts of northern Alaska, travels 3000 km and stops for the winter season with an Inuit family in Tuktoyaktuk, a hamlet in the far north of Canada. Season 2: Charles Hedrich start again after winter on July 12, 2014 from Tuktoyaktuk, on September 5, 2014, after an additional 2000 km of travel, the adventurer is stopped by a 250 km compact ice cap. He organizes his boat for the winter in Taloyoak, an Inuit village in Canada's Far North. He has 1,000 kilometres of rowing left to reach the exit of the mythical Baffin Sea Passage. Waiting for season 3, Charles Hedrich goes for another world premiere: crossing the Atacama desert on its Chilean part in autonomy without any supplies. 1300 km to cover with a tow truck weighing up to 150 kg loaded, in the highest and driest desert in the world. He left Arica, a city located in the far north of Chile, on April 7, 2015, and arrived in Copiapo on May 9, 2015 after 32 days and 5h30 of expedition. A few months later, back to the Northwest Passage. Season 3: On August 13, 2015, he leaves Taloyoak for the most northerly part of the passage. This year, if the ice is not as compact as the year before, but the headwinds are there. The progression is slow, the adventurer sometimes advances at 1 km/h, but the kilometers are done. On September 16 at 4pm (local time), after 3 seasons, 2 winter seasons, 6000 km, 165 days of rowing from the Bering Strait, Charles Hedrich arrived in Pond Inlet and completed the 1st Northwest Passage solo and by rowing. Since 2014, he has been hosting a section called \\"Where is Charlie?\\" in the morning of Radio Nova in which he tells about one of his adventures. He is also a columnist for other media such as Le Dauphin√© Lib√©r√© and Radio Mont Blanc. In 2016, he began the 1st Tour de France with the same rowing he succeeded the 1st Northwest Passage. The challenge: to complete a continuous tour, 5 months of expedition, 3,000 km to cover and more than 505 locks to cross. He leaves on May 20 from the Quai d'Austerlitz in Paris. The different stages are: Seine river, Marne river, the side canal to the Marne, the canal between Champagne and Burgundy, the Petite Sa√¥ne, Sa√¥ne river, Rh√¥ne river, the canal du Rh√¥ne to S√®te, the canal du Midi, the canal to the Garonne, the Garonne, the Garonne, Gironde river, Atlantic Ocean, the Vilaine, the canal d'Ille-et-Rance, the S√©e, Orne river, the English channel, the Somme, the Oise, Seine river.... for an arrival at the Champs-√âlys√©es port in Paris on 20 October 2016. 2017-2018: Walking expedition in the Sahara and Taklamakan deserts. 2019: Climbing Expedition to Muztagata (7546 m China).

It is located near the northern end of the lake, at . It is also called Johannesinsel (John's Island or St. John's), after the marble statue of John of Nepomuk that was erected on the island in 1711. The island is 61 meters long north-south and up to 26 meters wide, with an area of 1260 square meters (0.31 acres). On the eastern side, small boats can land, but not the passenger boats going to St. Bartholom√§. The island is part of the municipality of Sch√∂nau am K√∂nigssee. The land is owned by the Free State of Bavaria.  Statue  A well-known monument on the island is the statue of John of Nepomuk, patron of against the dangers of the water. The statue is about 180 cm high and made of marble. It stands on a hill in the northern portion of the island, on top of a pedestal about two meters high. The statue was erected in 1711 and donated by Johann Anton Zeitlmayer, director of chancellery and land judge of the Berchtesgaden Provostry, after all four passengers involved in a boat accident had been rescued. Since the erection of this statue, the island has also been called Johannesinsel (John's island or St. John's). It is believed that previously a statue of Apostle Bartholomew was at this location.  Platform  The platform on which the pedestal of the statue rests is enclosed by balustrades, and stairs lead to it from north and south. On the eastern side, the platform is supported by a brick wall that has two marble boards attached to it, with the inscriptions referring to the erection of the statue in 1711 and to its renovation in 1811. In front of the wall are two small stone pyramids. Their history and meaning is unknown. Next to this part of the island is the boat landing place. At the southern end of the island, a third stone pyramid has been established in the course of the renovation starting in 1810.  Grotto  Under the platform is a grotto, which is accessible through an iron gate from the west. The grotto has square floor plan, and the side panels have two niches each.

The Stipa-Caproni, also generally called the Caproni Stipa, was an experimental Italian aircraft designed in 1932 by Luigi Stipa (1900‚Äì1992) and built by Caproni. It featured a hollow, barrel-shaped fuselage with the engine and propeller completely enclosed by the fuselage‚Äîin essence, the whole fuselage was a single ducted fan. Although the Regia Aeronautica (Italian Royal Air Force) was not interested in pursuing development of the Stipa-Caproni, its design influenced the development of jet propulsion.O.E. Lancaster, High Speed Aerodynamics and Jet Propulsion. Vol. XII: Jet Propulsion Engines, Princeton 1959 claims that \\"The Stipa Aero plane built by Caproni in 1932 should be classified as a Jet Aircraft. The Stipa Aero plane can be considered as a predecessor of the Jet Aircraft of today.\\" Stipa's design A front view of the Stipa-Caproni, showing Stipa's \\"intubed propeller\\" design in which the propeller and engine are mounted inside a hollow tube which constitutes the aeroplane's fuselage. The spats have been removed from the landing gear. Stipas basic idea, which he called the \\"intubed propeller\\", was to mount the engine and propeller inside a fuselage that itself formed a tapered duct, or venturi tube, and compressed the propeller's airflow and the engine exhaust before it exited the duct at the trailing edge of the aircraft, essentially applying Bernoulli's principle of fluid movements to make the aircraft's engine more efficient. This is a similar principle as is used in turbofan engines but used a piston engine to drive the compressor/propeller rather than a gas turbine. Stipa later became convinced that German rocket and jet technology (especially the V-1 flying bomb) was using his patented invention without giving proper credit, although his ducted fan design had little mechanically in common with turbojet engines and nothing at all with the pulsejet used on the V-1. Stipa spent years studying the idea mathematically while working in the Engineering Division of the Italian Air Ministry, eventually determining that the venturi tube's inner surface needed to be shaped like an airfoil in order to achieve the greatest efficiency. He also determined the optimum shape of the propeller, the most efficient distance between the leading edge of the tube and the propeller, and the best rate of revolution of the propeller. Finally, he petitioned the Italian Fascist government to produce a prototype aircraft. The government, seeking to showcase Italian technological achievement‚Äîparticularly in aviation‚Äîcontracted the Caproni company to construct the aircraft in 1932. The resultant aircraft‚Äîa mid-wing monoplane of mostly wooden construction dubbed the Stipa-Caproni or Caproni Stipa. The fuselage was a barrel-like tube, short and fat, open at both ends to form the tapered duct, with twin open cockpits in tandem mounted in a hump on top of it. The wings were elliptical and passed through the duct and the engine nacelle inside it. The duct itself had a profile similar to that of the airfoils, and a fairly small rudder and elevators were mounted on the trailing edge of the duct, allowing the ducted propeller wash to flow directly over them as it exited the fuselage to improve handling. The propeller was mounted inside the fuselage tube, flush with the leading edge of the fuselage, and the 120-horsepower de Havilland Gipsy III engine that powered it was mounted within the duct behind it at the midpoint of the fuselage. The aircraft had low, fixed, spatted main landing gear and a tailwheel. It was painted in a blue-and-cream scheme of the type used on racing aircraft of the day, and its rudder bore the colors of the Italian flag. Test flights A front quarter view of the Stipa-Caproni with wheel spats removed. The Stipa-Caproni first flew on 7 October 1932 with Caproni company test pilot Domenico Antonini at the controls. Initial testing showed that the \\"intubed propeller\\" design did increase the engine's efficiency as Stipa had calculated, and the additional lift provided by the airfoil shape of the interior of the duct itself allowed a very low landing speed of only and assisted the Stipa-Caproni in achieving a higher rate of climb than other aircraft with similar power and wing loading. The placement of the rudder and elevators in the exhaust from the propeller wash at the trailing edge of the tube gave the aircraft handling characteristics that made it very stable in flight, although they later were enlarged to further improve the plane's handling characteristics. The Stipa-Caproni proved to be noticeably quieter than conventional aircraft of the time. Unfortunately, the \\"intubed propeller\\" design also induced so much aerodynamic drag that the benefits in engine efficiency were cancelled out, and the aircraft's top speed proved to be only .Guttman, Aviation History, March 2010, p. 19. When Caproni had completed initial testing, the Regia Aeronautica took control of the plane and transferred it to Guidonia Montecelio for a brief series of further test flights. All test pilots reported that the plane was extremely stable in flight, to the point where it was difficult to change course; test pilots were also astounded by the very low landing speed and the consequent very short landing run. The Stipa Caproni on the ground with the spats removed from its landing gear. Its light blue and cream paint scheme, similar to that on racing planes of the time, is visible, as is the opening at the trailing edge of its fuselage on which its rudder and elevators were mounted. The rudder is painted in the colors of the Italian flag. As the plane did not perform noticeably better than conventional aircraft designs, the Regia Aeronautica decided to cancel further development. No further prototypes were built. Influence Stipa himself never had intended his \\"intubed propeller\\" to be employed on single-engine aircraft like the Caproni-Stipa‚Äîwhich he viewed merely as a testbed‚Äîinstead envisioning its use in large, multi-engine flying wing aircraft he had been designing in which the aerodynamic drag properties would not be significant, and the Italian government publicized the Stipa-Caproni's design as an example of Italian aviation technology prowess. None of Stipa's flying-wing aircraft designs were built, but experiences collected with the Stipa-Caproni did become an important influence in the development of the motorjet-powered Caproni Campini N.1. The test flights of the Stipa-Caproni also sparked much academic interest, and resulted in Stipa's work being studied in France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom, and by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics in the United States. France designed‚Äîbut never constructed‚Äîan advanced night bomber based on a Luigi Stipa design in the mid-1930s, and various aircraft designs such as the German Heinkel T fighter of 1940 are thought to have incorporated some of Stipa's ideas as demonstrated by the Stipa-Caproni. The Kort nozzle ducted fan of today‚Äîdesigned in Germany in 1934‚Äîuses many of Stipa's principles. The modern turbofan engine is thought by some aviation historians to be a descendant of the \\"intubed propeller\\" demonstrated in the Stipa-Caproni. Replica In Australia, Lynette Zuccoli and Aerotec Queensland designed a 3/5-scale replica of the Stipa-Caproni, accurate even in terms of paint scheme and markings, powered by an Italian Simonini racing engine. They built it in 1998 and in October 2001 succeeded in making two directional test flights with it with Bryce Wolff at the controls. Each flight covered about and reached an altitude of approximately , with Wolff reporting that the replica was very stable in flight and performed much as the Italian test pilots reported that the original aircraft had 69 years to the month earlier.Legends in Our Own Lunchtimes: The Stipa Caproni The replica may never have flown again, and is now on static display at Toowoomba Airfield in Australia.

Mendelson's autobiography states that he was born on the first day of Sukoth 5736, which corresponds to 14 October 1875 (or late evening of 13 October). was a renowned Orthodox Jewish scholar, communal rabbi, Talmudist, Halachist, and rabbinical author (mechaber seforim). Early life Mendelson was born Yaakov Ben Zion Morein in 1875, in Kreitzburg, part of the Vitebsk district of what was then Russia, to his parents Menachem (Yiddish: Mendel) and Beila Rochel Morein. His rigorous Talmudic education started at age 7, and culminated with semicha ordination from the Rogatchover Gaon, one of the rabbinic greats of the time. Shortly thereafter, he was betrothed to a cousin, Feiga Skuy, but his marriage was postponed when he was drafted into the Russian Army. The army was very harsh for Jewish soldiers, and commanders were well known for trying to break the Jews from their religion. Morein deserted. After escaping Russia, he had several close calls evading Russian agents throughout Europe. He changed his surname to Mendelson (\\"Mendel's son,\\"), to make it harder for the government to track him. The British years Eventually, Mendelson emigrated to London, England. At age 22, he found a position as Rabbi and Dayan of Leeds, and of the ‚ÄòChevras Torah‚Äô shul there. He sent for his cousin Feiga, and they married in Leeds. In 1905, he took a new position as rabbi of Gateshead, and later, as rabbi of Glasgow, Scotland. In Glasgow, Mendelson demonstrated his community leadership and concern for its well-being countless times. In two instances, he thwarted cartels controlling certain commercial aspects of ritual, to keep prices stable. (See details in Communal advocacy and disputes.)  Chief Rabbi of Newark  When war broke out, Mendelson's son Chaim was old enough to be drafted. After Mendelson's experience with the Russian Army, he wanted to avoid that, and relocated to the United States in 1915. He would spend the rest of his life, personally and professionally, in Newark, New Jersey. In 1919, he took the rabbinical position of Congregation Tifereth Israel of Brisk d‚ÄôLita. In 1921 he was appointed as Chief Rabbi of Newark, with primary jurisdiction over matters of Shechita and Kashrus; he held the position until his death. Mendelson changed synagogue positions several times, leading Congregation Adas Yisroel, then Chevra B'nai Jacob Anshe Galicia, and finally founding his own shul, Congregation Beis Hamedrash Hagadol. To do so, he bought the defunct synagogue building formerly run by Rabbi Meyer Isserman. He opened a larger building next door on August 14, 1934, in a large ceremony attended by hundreds of locals along with rabbis from Passaic, West New York, the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Philadelphia. It was commonly known as the Bergen Street Shul. Distinguished for his scholarship and devotion to the Jewish community, Mendelson was a member of Knesseth ha-Rabbanim (the Assembly of Hebrew Orthodox Rabbis of America and Canada), where he was considered an expert in kashruth. He became a leader of the organization, and was featured at or presided over many of its conventions. * 11th convention, addressing issues of cooperation among Orthodox rabbis, improving education, marital law, religious courts, and kosher meat, * 13th convention, he gave the keynote address (10 February 1930), focusing on unity across rabbinic organizations, Sabbath observance, Palestine, kashruth, Prohibition, and alien registration. * 15th convention, presided, and elected vice president of the organization * At the September 10, 1940 convention session, he made an impassioned plea, to all of American Jewry, for the support of war refugees. Legacy Mendelson died in 1941, leaving a widow, five sons, four daughters and twelve grandchildren. Another son, Shmuel Dov, died in a scalding accident in Gateshead in 1905. Interment is at North Arlington Jewish Cemetery, whose Newark Orthodox section was purchased and organized under his aegis. His synagogue, Beis Hamedrash Hagadol, continued to function, until an eminent domain seizure for the construction Interstate 78. Both the synagogue and Mendelson's house, one block east at 349 Chadwick Avenue, were condemned. He was the personal Talmud teacher to a young Gedalia Dov Schwartz, who became a leading American rabbi in New York and Chicago. Mendelson was an author of Talmudic and Rabbinic works. He wrote six volumes of scholarship: *Sha‚Äôarei Tzion (Leeds, 1903) - on the Talmud (with approbation from Rabbi Shlomo HaKohen, Dayan of Vilna) *Sefer Hatzid (Leeds, 1904) - laws relating to ritual slaughter *Midrash Yaavetz (Glasgow, 1911) - Halacha and Aggadah on the Book of GenesisMidrash Yaavetz had approbations from Rabbi Nosson Halevi Bamberger of W√ºrzburg; Rabbi Menachem Dovber Dagutski of Manchester; Rabbi Refoel Zilberman of Tzfas; Rabbi Eliyahu Posek of Alapolia in Russia; Rabbi Eliezer Dan Yachai of Lutzin and Rabbi Shlomo Yaakov Koton of Leshenov, and with a warm letter from Rabbi Akiva HaCohen Matlon of Heina in Minsk province, at the time part of Russia. *Mishnas Yaavetz on Chagiga (Leeds, 1903) a summary of the final rulings of this volume of Talmud Bavli *Mishnas Yaavetz (1928) an anthology of three previously unpublished books by the author ** Vol. One on androgyny ** Vol. Two of Talmudic novellae ** Vol. Three of responsa Many of Mendelson's children and grandchildren took leadership positions in national Jewish organizations and local Jewish communities; see Relatives, below. One of his grandchildren claims to have a collection of zemiros, Sabbath meal devotional songs, composed by his grandfather. Relatives Mendelson's son Harry and his descendants reverted to the original family surname of Morein, though other family members continued to use Mendelson. Harry Morein was a founder of the Young Israel of Newark, and an early advocate to change New Jersey's Sunday blue laws, forbidding commerce on Sunday. Today, he has many descendants involved in communal life at the national and local levels, including kashruth administration at the Orthodox Union, and the teaching faculty of Yeshiva University's Manhattan Talmudical Academy High School and cantorial leadership. He arranged for a cousin, Rabbi Dovid Menachem Morein, to come to Gateshead as the town's first Melamed. Morein's son Wolf was rabbi of the North London Shul, while his daughter Bluma married Rabbi Gedalia Schneider, Rosh Yeshiva of London's Yeshiva Toras Emes (\\"Schneider's Yeshiva\\"). It was the only Yeshiva in London of the classic Lithuanian mold, and many of its top students moved on to Gateshead, Bluma's hometown, to become early members of the Gateshead kollel in the 1940s. Mendelson's son, Cantor Nechemya \\"Chemmy\\" (Nathan) Mendelson was a founding member and president of the Cantors Assembly. He served as Chazzan of Montreal's Congregation Shaar Hashomayim from 1938 to 1973. Brothers Jacob \\"Jackie\\" Mendelson and Solomon, or Sol, \\"Tucky\\" Mendelson are grandchildren. Both have been presidents of the Cantors Assembly, with Jackie serving in 2003-2004, and Sol serving President, Programming Chair, Journal Editorial Board member, journal article author, and leading many events on behalf of the organization, including: * 1983 recruitment seminar at University of Hartford Hartt School of Music * 1987 annual convention * 1996 annual convention * 1992 lay meeting * 1984-1988 committee membership on the approach to Hazanot * 1989 joint project with National Coalition Supporting Soviet Jewry * First Gulf War Israeli support trips (together with brother Jackie), and organization of the trips * Shoah remembrance project In addition to Mendelson's descendants, several close relatives by marriage had significant impact on the Newark kehila, mostly originating with his support. Louis Skui (later Sky) was Mendelson's brother-in-law and chief shochet. Upon Mendelson's death, due to the previous dispute with Rabbi Konvitz, Sky was unable to work as a shochet. He opened Sky Hebrew Books (later SkyBook), a large supplier of books and etrogs to congregations across the United States for over 50 years. Joseph Gross was president of Mendelson's Bergen Street Shul, administrator of the Mendelson-lead Vaad Hakashruth, and later mechutan to the Mendelsons, after the marriage of children Samuel Gross and Leesa Mendelson. Samuel was later a president of the shul, in the 1940s and 1950s. Communal advocacy and disputes In Glasgow, Mendelson defied business interests to bring down communal costs for Passover Matzah and Mikvah use. At one point, to prevent price gouging, he rented the production facilities of Consolidated Biscuit, kashered it, and ran Matzah production, causing the prior bakery cartel to lose all business for the year. In Newark, he published a controversial ruling regarding the permissibility, under certain conditions, of using a Shochet who is not Sabbath-observant. The opinion is cited and argued against by Rabbi Shimon Shkop. In 1921, he succeeded Rabbi Dov Ber Halperin as the kashruth authority for Newark, on consensus of most local rabbis, ritual slaughterers, lay leaders, and kashruth supervisors in the city. The position included responsibility for Jewish slaughterhouses, butchers, and the kosher operations of Swift & Co., and effectively made him chief rabbi of the city. Around 1925, Rabbi Joseph Konvitz created a rival kosher supervision in the city. He won the Swift & Co. kosher division's contract, displacing the incumbent city kashruth agency, and attempted to become the sole kashruth authority for Newark. The two parties and their organizations brought allegations, rebuttals, and counterallegations against each other. Konvitz filed a lawsuit in religious court (Beth Din), while Mendelson got a consensus of leading rabbis to back his position. There resulted a permanent rift in the city over rabbinate, with competing Vaadei Kashruth.

Numerical methods fail because of the near- cancellation of the positive and negative contributions to the integral. Each has to be integrated to very high precision in order for their difference to be obtained with useful accuracy. The sign problem is one of the major unsolved problems in the physics of many-particle systems. It often arises in calculations of the properties of a quantum mechanical system with large number of strongly interacting fermions, or in field theories involving a non- zero density of strongly interacting fermions. Overview In physics the sign problem is typically (but not exclusively) encountered in calculations of the properties of a quantum mechanical system with large number of strongly interacting fermions, or in field theories involving a non-zero density of strongly interacting fermions. Because the particles are strongly interacting, perturbation theory is inapplicable, and one is forced to use brute-force numerical methods. Because the particles are fermions, their wavefunction changes sign when any two fermions are interchanged (due to the anti-symmetry of the wave function, see Pauli principle). So unless there are cancellations arising from some symmetry of the system, the quantum-mechanical sum over all multi-particle states involves an integral over a function that is highly oscillatory, hence hard to evaluate numerically, particularly in high dimension. Since the dimension of the integral is given by the number of particles, the sign problem becomes severe in the thermodynamic limit. The field-theoretic manifestation of the sign problem is discussed below. The sign problem is one of the major unsolved problems in the physics of many-particle systems, impeding progress in many areas: * Condensed matter physics ‚Äî It prevents the numerical solution of systems with a high density of strongly correlated electrons, such as the Hubbard model. * Nuclear physics ‚Äî It prevents the ab initio calculation of properties of nuclear matter and hence limits our understanding of nuclei and neutron stars. * Quantum field theory ‚Äî It prevents the use of lattice QCD to predict the phases and properties of quark matter. (In lattice field theory, the problem is also known as the complex action problem.) The sign problem in field theory In a field theory approach to multi-particle systems, the fermion density is controlled by the value of the fermion chemical potential \\\\mu. One evaluates the partition function Z by summing over all classical field configurations, weighted by \\\\exp(-S) where S is the action of the configuration. The sum over fermion fields can be performed analytically, and one is left with a sum over the bosonic fields \\\\sigma (which may have been originally part of the theory, or have been produced by a Hubbard‚ÄìStratonovich transformation to make the fermion action quadratic) :Z = \\\\int D \\\\sigma \\\\; \\\\rho[\\\\sigma] where D \\\\sigma represents the measure for the sum over all configurations \\\\sigma(x) of the bosonic fields, weighted by :\\\\rho[\\\\sigma]=\\\\det(M(\\\\mu,\\\\sigma))\\\\exp(-S[\\\\sigma]) where S is now the action of the bosonic fields, and M(\\\\mu,\\\\sigma) is a matrix that encodes how the fermions were coupled to the bosons. The expectation value of an observable A[\\\\sigma] is therefore an average over all configurations weighted by \\\\rho[\\\\sigma] : \\\\langle A \\\\rangle_\\\\rho = \\\\frac{\\\\int D \\\\sigma \\\\; A[\\\\sigma] \\\\; \\\\rho[\\\\sigma]}{\\\\int D \\\\sigma \\\\; \\\\rho[\\\\sigma]} . If \\\\rho[\\\\sigma] is positive, then it can be interpreted as a probability measure, and \\\\langle A \\\\rangle_\\\\rho can be calculated by performing the sum over field configurations numerically, using standard techniques such as Monte Carlo importance sampling. The sign problem arises when \\\\rho[\\\\sigma] is non- positive. This typically occurs in theories of fermions when the fermion chemical potential \\\\mu is nonzero, i.e. when there is a nonzero background density of fermions. If \\\\mu eq 0 there is no particle-antiparticle symmetry, and \\\\det(M(\\\\mu,\\\\sigma)), and hence the weight \\\\rho(\\\\sigma), is in general a complex number, so Monte Carlo importance sampling cannot be used to evaluate the integral.  Reweighting procedure  A field theory with a non-positive weight can be transformed to one with a positive weight, by incorporating the non-positive part (sign or complex phase) of the weight into the observable. For example, one could decompose the weighting function into its modulus and phase, :\\\\rho[\\\\sigma] = p[\\\\sigma]\\\\, \\\\exp(i\\\\theta[\\\\sigma]) where p[\\\\sigma] is real and positive, so : \\\\langle A \\\\rangle_\\\\rho = \\\\frac{ \\\\int D\\\\sigma A[\\\\sigma] \\\\exp(i\\\\theta[\\\\sigma])\\\\; p[\\\\sigma]}{\\\\int D\\\\sigma \\\\exp(i\\\\theta[\\\\sigma])\\\\; p[\\\\sigma]} = \\\\frac{ \\\\langle A[\\\\sigma] \\\\exp(i\\\\theta[\\\\sigma]) \\\\rangle_p}{ \\\\langle \\\\exp(i\\\\theta[\\\\sigma]) \\\\rangle_p} Note that the desired expectation value is now a ratio where the numerator and denominator are expectation values that both use a positive weighting function, p[\\\\sigma]. However, the phase \\\\exp(i\\\\theta[\\\\sigma]) is a highly oscillatory function in the configuration space, so if one uses Monte Carlo methods to evaluate the numerator and denominator, each of them will evaluate to a very small number, whose exact value is swamped by the noise inherent in the Monte Carlo sampling process. The \\"badness\\" of the sign problem is measured by the smallness of the denominator \\\\langle \\\\exp(i\\\\theta[\\\\sigma]) \\\\rangle_p: if it is much less than 1 then the sign problem is severe. It can be shown (e.g.) that :\\\\langle \\\\exp(i\\\\theta[\\\\sigma]) \\\\rangle_p \\\\propto \\\\exp(-f V/T) where V is the volume of the system, T is the temperature, and f is an energy density. The number of Monte Carlo sampling points needed to obtain an accurate result therefore rises exponentially as the volume of the system becomes large, and as the temperature goes to zero. The decomposition of the weighting function into modulus and phase is just one example (although it has been advocated as the optimal choice since it minimizes the variance of the denominator ). In general one could write :\\\\rho[\\\\sigma] = p[\\\\sigma] \\\\frac{\\\\rho[\\\\sigma]}{p[\\\\sigma]} where p[\\\\sigma] can be any positive weighting function (for example, the weighting function of the \\\\mu=0 theory.) The badness of the sign problem is then measured by :\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\frac{\\\\rho[\\\\sigma]}{p[\\\\sigma]}\\\\right\\\\rangle_p \\\\propto \\\\exp(-f V/T) which again goes to zero exponentially in the large-volume limit. Methods for reducing the sign problem The sign problem is NP-hard, implying that a full and generic solution of the sign problem would also solve all problems in the complexity class NP in polynomial time. If (as is generally suspected) there are no polynomial-time solutions to NP problems (see P versus NP problem), then there is no generic solution to the sign problem. This leaves open the possibility that there may be solutions that work in specific cases, where the oscillations of the integrand have a structure that can be exploited to reduce the numerical errors. In systems with a moderate sign problem, such as field theories at a sufficiently high temperature or in a sufficiently small volume, the sign problem is not too severe and useful results can be obtained by various methods, such as more carefully tuned reweighting, analytic continuation from imaginary \\\\mu to real \\\\mu, or Taylor expansion in powers of \\\\mu. There are various proposals for solving systems with a severe sign problem: * Meron-cluster algorithms. These achieve an exponential speed-up by decomposing the fermion world lines into clusters that contribute independently. Cluster algorithms have been developed for certain theories, but not for the Hubbard model of electrons, nor for QCD, the theory of quarks. * Stochastic quantization. The sum over configurations is obtained as the equilibrium distribution of states explored by a complex Langevin equation. So far, the algorithm has been found to evade the sign problem in test models that have a sign problem but do not involve fermions. * Fixed-node method. One fixes the location of nodes (zeros) of the multiparticle wavefunction, and uses Monte Carlo methods to obtain an estimate of the energy of the ground state, subject to that constraint. * Majorana algorithms. Using Majorana fermion representation to perform Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations can help to solve the fermion sign problem of a class of fermionic many-body models.
