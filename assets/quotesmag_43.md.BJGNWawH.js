Lake presides as a judge over her own tabloid talk/nontraditional courtroom series, Paternity Court. Youth and early adulthood Lake was born in Detroit, Michigan to parents who had \\"very particular expectations\\" for their daughter's future; in her words, \\"These were Black people who fought their way through, one Ph.D. at a time, so they were big on education.\\" Growing up, Lake sang, danced, and acted in plays. Her parents agreed to allow this as long as she kept up with her studies. Lake attended Mercy High School in Farmington Hills, Michigan, and was honored as a National Merit Scholar in 1986. In May 1990, Lake earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan. She earned a secondary teacher certification that same year. In May 1993, Lake earned a Juris Doctor from Wayne State University Law School in Detroit, Michigan.

In June 2002, she was also admitted to the State Bar of New York and the State Bar of New Jersey, where her practice is predominantly devoted to entertainment and family law. Whilst engaged in her legal education she also pursued her creative passions and began designing professionally after graduating from law school. Entertainment industry Music industry In 1999, Lake relocated to New York City, determined to establish herself as an entertainer. She immediately began securing jobs singing background for multi-platinum selling artists, such as Mary J. Blige, Sean \\"Puff Daddy\\" Combs, Jay-Z, Dr. Dre, and Snoop Dogg. Lake then began writing and recording her own music and performing throughout the New York metropolitan area. She has produced album projects and secured label record deals for artists signed to her production company.

She encourages the same manner of thinking to her clients, that is, to think outside the box when creating their dream homes and to make sure their personalities come alive in their space of choice. She often prompts their imaginations with her signature question: \\"If your room could talk, what would you want it to say?\\" She presides over her own tabloid talk/courtroom series, Paternity Court, which began on September 23, 2013, and is produced by MGM Television.

It was opened in 1967 after a mass demonstration that took place in Yerevan on April 24, 1965, on the 50th anniversary of the deportation of hundreds of Armenian intellectuals from Constantinople that marked the beginning of the Genocide. After Armenia's independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, the memorial became part of official ceremonies. Since then, almost every foreign official who visited Armenia included a visit to the memorial to pay tribute to the victims of the Armenian Genocide. A visit to Tsitsernakaberd also includes a tour in the museum. Some notable visitors have planted trees near the memorial. A wide range of politicians, artists, musicians, athletes, and religious figures have visited the memorial. The most notable ones include Presidents of Russia (Boris Yeltsin, Vladimir Putin, Dmitry Medvedev), France (Jacques Chirac, Nicolas Sarkozy, Fran√ßois Hollande), Ukraine, Czech Republic, Poland, Greece, Georgia, Iran, Belarus, Romania, Lebanon, Croatia, Serbia, and Prime Ministers of Bulgaria, Czech Republic and other countries. Foreign Ministers of many countries (including US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and several high-ranking officials of the European Union ‚Äî including Jos√© Manuel Barroso and Herman Van Rompuy) ‚Äî have honored the victims by visiting Tsitsernakaberd. Other visitors include Pope John Paul II in 2001, Pope Francis in 2016, the Chief Rabbi of Israel Yona Metzger, the Primate of All England Rowan Williams, the Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church Kirill I of Moscow, World Chess champion Vladimir Kramnik, World football champion Youri Djorkaeff, English rock star Ian Gillan, Serbian filmmaker Emir Kusturica, French actors G√©rard Depardieu and Alain Delon, Nobel Prize winner in Physics Zhores Alferov. No current Turkish state official has visited Tsitsernakaberd. Significance and controversies Recognition of the Armenian Genocide is one of the most important foreign policy issues of Armenia, and is the number one goal of the diaspora Armenian organizations. Many Armenians look at these visits as a sign of recognition of the genocide. Pope John Paul II's visit in 2001 Pope John Paul II arrived in Yerevan on September 25, 2001 to participate in the celebrations of 1,700th anniversary of the adoption of Christianity as the national religion of Armenia. The Pope visited the memorial the next day after meeting with President Robert Kocharyan. He laid a wreath for the victims of the genocide, made a short speech, and read a prayer. The Pope used the term Metz Yeghern (the Armenian word for genocide, which literally translates as \\"Great Crime\\") in his prayer, causing a controversy regarding whether he recognized the events of 1915 as a genocide or not. This move by the leader of the Roman Catholic Church aroused a wave of discontent in Turkey. On October 1, 2001, PanARMENIAN.Net stated that the \\"Turkish media expresses sorrows as Pope said the word \\"genocide\\" [on the] last day of his visit.\\" Hillary Clinton's visit in 2010 US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrived in Yerevan on July 4, on America's independence day, thus becoming the highest-ranked US official to visit the country. Her visit was considered \\"to be symbolic but nonetheless significant\\" and her possible visit to Tsitsernakaberd became a subject of much discussion in the Armenian media. The United States has not recognized the Armenian Genocide officially and by visiting the genocide memorial, many thought that by her visit, the United States sent a clear political message to Turkey. She went to the memorial on July 5, 2010, before leaving for Tbilisi. The wreath that Clinton laid at the memorial read \\"From Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton\\" although it was first announced that her visit would be non-official. Refusals Turkish President Abdullah G√ºl visited Armenia in September 2008 to attend a football match between the Armenian and Turkish national teams in Yerevan. Since the Turkish government denies the fact of genocide, he did not visit the memorial. Other presidents who opted not to pay a visit to Tsitsernakaberd were Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Iranian Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. They refused to visit the memorial so as not to compromise their bilateral relationship with neighboring Turkey. In 2010, Mevl√ºt √áavu≈üoƒülu, the Turkish President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, refused to visit the memorial stating, \\"it is my own decision. I respect your opinion and you should respect mine.\\"  Politicians  Presidents * Carlos Menem (1998) * Emil Constantinescu (1998) * Petar Stoyanov (1999) * Constantinos Stephanopoulos (1999) * √âmile

The document, dated to 1055, lists the lands the king donated to the newly founded Tihany Abbey. It is mostly in Latin, but contains several Hungarian words and expressions, the longest of which is feheruuaru rea meneh hodu utu rea (in modern Hungarian: Feh√©rv√°rra men≈ë hadi √∫tra, 'onto the military road leading to Feh√©rv√°r'). Background The Benedictine abbey of Tihany was founded by King Andrew I and was dedicated to the Virgin Mary and Aignan of Orleans. The establishing charter is likely to have been composed by Bishop Nicholas. The Benedictine monks were settled in Tihany by King Andrew, who had a church and a monastery built for them on the hill of the Tihany peninsula near Lake Balaton. The charter, written on vellum, is today in the Benedictine abbey of Pannonhalma. The road mentioned must have been a military road from Roman times, still used in medieval times. It was the most important road from Feh√©rv√°r to the south. Feh√©rv√°r ‚Äì today Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r ‚Äì was one of the most important cities of medieval Hungary.Zelliger Erzs√©bet: Els≈ë nyelveml√©keink √©s a 950 √©ves Tihanyi alap√≠t√≥lev√©l, √öj Ember, 2005. november 20., www.benceskiado.hu Content The Hungarian words in the text reflect 11th century Hungarian language. Not only proper nouns, but common nouns and expressions are included. The longest of these, & feheruuaru rea meneh hodu utu rea clearly shows a language stage in which the -ra suffix (-re after front vowels) has not yet evolved into a suffix from a postposition, and in which the final vowels are still preserved (compare 'Feheruuaru' with modern 'Feh√©rv√°r' and 'utu' with modern '√∫t' ‚Äì don't pay attention to the diacritics as in 1055 Hungarian spelling was not yet developed to show the a/√° and u/√∫ difference, although they must have existed in pronunciation). In total, the document includes 58 Hungarian words, among them Tichon, an early spelling of the name Tihany.

The L√∂benicht Town Hall () was the town hall of L√∂benicht, first an independent town and later a quarter of K√∂nigsberg, Germany. In the 19th century it was used for newspaper printing. The town hall was located at the intersection of L√∂benichtsche Langgasse and M√ºnchengasse. It is unknown when it was originally built, but construction on the Gothic building was documented in 1592. After the merger of L√∂benicht, Altstadt, and Kneiphof into K√∂nigsberg in 1724 and the selection of Kneiphof Town Hall as the new city hall, L√∂benicht's town hall was used by the city treasury. The building had to be reconstructed after a conflagration on 11 November 1764. It was used subsequently rented by the brewery guilds and the bookseller Johann Jacob Kanter, who allowed Immanuel Kant to live in the mansard attic in 1769. It was purchased by the printer Gottlieb Leberecht Hartung in 1788, who used it to publish his newspaper, later known as the K√∂nigsberger Hartungsche Zeitung, the following year. The building was damaged again by fire in 1876. The Hartungsche Zeitung and the K√∂nigsberger Tageblatt were published in the former town hall until 1906, when it was damaged by fire and the printers moved to M√ºnchenhofplatz between L√∂benicht and Altstadt.

Forming on December 17, the winter storm moved across the midwest, forcing schools to close throughout the region. Numerous warnings and advisories had been posted by the National Weather Service for many states, including Iowa, Nebraska, Illinois, and Wisconsin. Both O'Hare International Airport and Midway International Airport in Chicago, Illinois canceled most departures and arrivals. According to flight tracking website FlightStats.com, more than 1,000 flights were canceled across the region. More than 130,000 customers were without power across the west and midwest. In addition to snow, strong thunderstorms and possible tornadoes went across the Southern United States. A multiple-car pileup on Interstate 35 in Fort Dodge, Iowa killed two people, according to the Iowa State Patrol. American Airlines, American Eagle Airlines, and Southwest Airlines collectively canceled a total of 573 flights in the midwest. Greyhound Lines also canceled service in Chicago, Minneapolis, and Indianapolis. The storm moved east towards the Northeast and New England. Winter storm and blizzard warnings were issued from north New York to western Pennsylvania. Meteorological synopsis Snowfall over the Midwest on December 21 On December 17, an upper-level shortwave and associated trough made landfall along the coast of the Pacific Northwest. The system initially moved towards the southeast, strengthening over the Rocky Mountains. This led to the development and formation of a surface low over eastern Colorado early on December 19\\\\. The low began to curve towards the northeast, and its barometric pressure began to deepen. The low attained its lowest pressure at 1800 UTC on December 20 over northern Illinois. However, the system became occluded, and as such moved quickly to the northeast, where it weakened and subsequently dissipated over southern Ontario late on December 21\\\\. Another low pressure area formed in the vicinity of the previous low over the East Coast of the United States, which quickly moved north across the coast, bringing heavy snowfalls to the region. The low later exited the continental United States on December 22. During the next several days, the winter storm drifted northeastward, and eventually to the south of Greenland, before finally being absorbed by another more powerful extratropical cyclone just south of Iceland, on December 29. Impact Southern United States =Arkansas= Damage caused by an EF1 tornado in Grant County, Arkansas A dry line associated with the system moved east across eastern Oklahoma and northwestern Arkansas, helping to trigger thunderstorm and shower development across Arkansas. The thunderstorms produced wind gusts as high as , downing trees and power lines. Power outages affected 40,000 people throughout the state as a result of the storms. South of Delight, Arkansas, at least three barns were displaced due to the strong winds. Hail measuring up to was recorded in Logan County, Arkansas. In addition, dust from drought stricken areas was carried aloft into the storm system, falling to the ground and thus coating cars in mud. One of these thunderstorms also spawned a short lived tornado near Lavaca, Arkansas on December 19\\\\. The tornado was rated as an EF1 on the Enhanced Fujita scale, after damaging various trees, homes, and blowing roofs off of structures. A second EF1 tornado was reported west of Sheridan, Arkansas the following day, destroying a mobile home. =Alabama= Strong storms began to develop and organize ahead of a cold front produced by the winter storm in the early hours of December 20. One of these storms developed off the Louisiana coast, before strengthening and moving ashore in Alabama. The storm developed strong rotation in its updraft and a mesocyclone formed. As a result, the storm spawned a tornado, later rated as an EF1, that moved across areas of northwest Mobile, Alabama. The tornado damaged various homes and businesses in the area. Other storms that formed across Alabama caused power outages to 18,000 people, of which 8,600 people were in Mobile.

History The channel started out by operating every weekday from 9:00am to 3:30pm; broadcasting proceedings of the California Senate, Assembly and their various committees. It now runs twenty four hours a day reaching 5.5 million subscribers across the state. The channel was created by the Center for Governmental Studies together with the Annenberg School of Communications at the University of Southern California and first broadcast on February 4, 1991. In 1993, the California Cable Television Industry assumed responsibility for governance and funding for the channel. In mid-August 2019, the CCTA announced the network's closure. The organization and network cited the November 2016 passage of Proposition 54, a ballot initiative which required all legislative proceedings to be recorded and made public with posting them on the Internet 72 hours before a vote was tallied, and be accessible for twenty years after a proceeding. As the Senate and Assembly have internal video and radio news services, the CCTA considered The California Channel effectively a duplicative service to those efforts. The legislature has since made efforts to retain the network and its coverage before the network's closure, to keep proceedings public on a televised venue in some form.

For most of its time it served as the official residence of the Kiev Governor General of Southwestern Krai. Historical background The construction date of the building is unknown. It is first mentioned in 1817. The palace was located at the corner of vulytsia Instytutska and vulytsia Levashovska (today Shovkovychna) in the vicinity of today's address numbers 18 and 20. According to the Kiev historian Theodore-Richard Ernst the building belonged to the Major General Dmitry Begichev. Later the building was owned by Artillery Colonel Andrei Zakharovich Ivanov who land it out for profit. One of his clients was Nikolay Raevsky who stayed in the building in 1821-25. In 1833 Ivanov sold the house to the state treasury for 100,000 rubles. Since then the building was used as an official residence. The first resident of the house was Vasiliy Levashov, the first official Governor General. Until 1914 the palace was a residence of the Governor General of Southwestern Krai. Upon liquidation of the position, the building was given to the Kiev governor in 1915. In January 1918, just before the Bolshevik forces sacked Kiev, Volodymyr Vynnychenko was able to secure the palace after the General Secretariat of Ukraine. However right after the establishment of the Ukrainian State on April 29, 1918, the house was redesignated as an official residence of the Hetman of Ukraine and after December 14, 1918 belonged to Symon Petliura. Due to war and political situation, none of the Ukrainian state official stayed in the house for long. In 1919-20 the power in Kiev changed rapidly with advancement of the Russian forces of White Guard movement and the Liberation forces of Poland. In spring of 1920 Kiev for a short period (five weeks) was occupied by the Ukrainian allied Polish forces (anti-Bolshevik pact) and the palace was used as an ammo storage. Upon withdrawal the building was blown into pieces. Due to the extent of a damage the building could not be rebuilt and in 1925 a small city park was created in its place. Description Blueprints of Vladimir Nikolayev of 1879 give an idea about facade of the Governor General Palace. Its length constituted , to the right there was a three windows annex with a cast iron porch on columns as a side entrance, while further there was a four windows annex of the Saint Nicholas Dome Church that was built on the funds of the Russian Ministry of Interior. The full length of structure along vulytsia Instytutska amounted to . A hall of official receptions was located across a significant part of the building. During times of Trepov it was refurbished with white gilded furniture, while floor was covered with a white and pink carpet. The Cabinet of the Governor-General and his family rooms were located on the second floor. The whole mansion was composed of three parts, while a bigger area was occupied by an old orchard which partially was left preserved to our days. The orchid was once a part of the Klov Park. On a corner there was a kitchen side house that was connected with the palace by a stone gallery and other outbuilding (sheds for firewood and ice storage). Separately, via gates towards Instytutska, there was located household yard with large stables, cartwright, barn, orangery and coachman house. A \\"stone barn for automobiles\\" was built in December 1911. Wooden stripped booths for guards stood to the side from the cast iron porch. See also * Southwestern Krai Bibliography * Tretyak, K.O.

Azwan is one of the individuals mentioned during the press conference by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission on 8 January 2020 with regards to audio recordings of telephone conversations relating to the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal. Azwan has been vocal in championing the issues related to youth and the future generations of Malaysia. His progressive political views can be seen through various initiatives that he brought forward including supporting English medium school, organising interfaith dialogue, and becoming the chairman for Kuala Lumpur International Youth Discourse (KLIYD). He was the chairman for KLIYD for 2 consecutive years. Since 23 October 2013, he has been the Deputy Leader of UMNO Youth Wing and a member of UMNO Supreme Council chaired by the Party President. He won the post in the national party election with Khairy Jamaluddin who won the post of National Leader of UMNO Youth Wing.Archives  The Star OnlineUMNO Youth Academy signs MoA to address unemployment  My Sinchew Prior to this, Azwan was the Leader of Barisan Nasional Perak Youth (the youth organisation of Malaysia's governing coalition), and the Head of the Perak State UMNO Youth Wing. At UMNO's grassroots level, he has held the post of Youth Chief for the Pasir Salak Division. Personal background Azwan had his tertiary education at the International Islamic University Matriculation Kuala Lumpur, and his university education at Cardiff University of Wales in the United Kingdom and Open University Malaysia in the Kuala Lumpur. While at Cardiff, he graduated with a Bachelor degree in Accounting in 1999. In 2007 he completed his Master degree in Management at Open University Malaysia. Azwan also successfully completed Leaders in Development Executive Course from Harvard Kennedy School, USA in 2014. After leaving university, Azwan started his career in 1999 with Ernst & Young, Chartered Accountants at Kuala Lumpur Office and held senior positions in Business Assurance and Corporate Recovery divisions. He was involved in E&Y; corporate advisory assignments at several public listed companies and GLC. Career Progress Azwan started his career in 1999 with Ernst & Young, Chartered Accountants at Kuala Lumpur Office and held senior positions in Business Assurance and Corporate Recovery divisions. He was involved in E&Y; corporate advisory assignments at several public listed companies and GLCs. He joined Perak State Government in 2004 and was appointed as CEO of Yayasan Bina Upaya Darul Ridzuan (YBUDR), a state charity foundation in 2010 until 2011. He is also an adjunct Lecturer of Management and Leadership at PETRONAS University of Technology. Azwan had also served as Chief of Staff at Perak Chief Minister's Office in 2009 until January 2010. After having served YBUDR as its founding CEO, Khairul Azwan has built his own corporate flagship namely Great Colour Group and continues to grow his group's business interest in energy, marine engineering, pharmaceutical and ICT. In sports, Azwan was the Deputy President of Perak Football Association and was Perak State Super League Team Manager from 2011 until 2013.  Political Views  Throughout his political career, Azwan stands out as a progressive, moderate and no-holds barred youth leader. He upheld the principle of Wasattiyah (Moderation) as promoted by the Prime Minister Dato' Sri Najib Tun Razak. He is known for speaking his mind. In his engagement programs with the youth throughout Malaysia, he has been vocal in championing issues pertinent to the Malaysian youth. In the most recent years, Azwan has urged for greater efforts to upskill convicted drug addicts to ensure they can integrate back into society. Azwan has also voiced his concern on issues of religious extremism, climate change, sustainable energy and the need to prepare the youth for the jobs of the future. Azwan writes constantly on the need for the youth to be attentive to the politics governing their nation. In an article in the New Straits Times, Azwan said: > \\"For as much as you can express your wants and opinions, you must also > listen to others and follow the traditions set to make sure everyone gets a > fair chance. Frustrations of not seeing your particular ideals met should > not warrant you to burn the bridge of this vital cooperation. What the youth > must comprehend and actually guard against is the wrong perception that > supporting your party president equates to yes-manning mindlessly. There are > values of being apart of a party, values of loyalty and the sincerity of > respect to leaders.\\" For Azwan, it matters little what side the youth choose to support. What matters more is the right form of politics, one that is less focused on character attacking and more on substantive factual debate. In this, Azwan has been aggressively vocal in criticizing the opposition for its emotional and sensationalism type politics. In the opposition's Alternative Budget 2018, Azwan spent weeks debunking the promises that the opposition proposed, from the fallacy of its proposition to eradicate all road tolls to eliminating GST. In this sense, Azwan is known to present tough economic ideas in words that the common man would understand. Azwan has been a stern critic of Mahathir Mohamed for his new role as Malaysia's opposition leader. Tun Dr Mahathir, a former Prime Minister of Malaysia for 22 years and now aged 93, became opposition leader in January 2018. For Azwan, this appointment is detrimental to the progress of youth leaders. He has expressed concern that a man of the past would not comprehend issues such as cyber security, jobs security, climate change and modern religious extremism. As noted by Azwan, having a credible opposition helps keep the government on its toes.  Kuala Lumpur International Youth Discourse  The Kuala Lumpur International Youth Discourse (KLIYD) is the brainchild of Khairul Azwan. It is a platform for youth to discuss geo-political issues in the focus of sovereignty, security, the cultures and the role of religion. During the discourse, Malaysian and foreign youth will be able to have an exchange of views and opinions with Malaysian policy makers, ministers, industry experts and academician. KLIYD has succeeded in shaping the youth to discuss important issues concerning them and the nation. During the inception of KLIYD, it focused on empowering youth for a safer and better future. The threat of terrorism and radicalism is seen as one of the most dangerous threat hence it should be tackled by the government. On the 2nd year, KLIYD emphasised on the importance of total security. Total security means protection from both traditional and non- traditional threat including job security, energy and power security, cyber security and food security. The discourse has created awareness amongst youth on the importance of total security to maintain a stable and prosperous nation. KLIYD is scheduled to become an annual platform for the youth to voice out their views.

Besides the common 18th century name K√∂nigsgarten, other historical names included Baumgarten, F√ºrstlicher Garten, Herzoglicher Garten, Hetzgarten, Lustgarten, Paradegarten, and Schlo√ügarten; in 1811 it was designated Paradeplatz.Karl, p. 119 Stadttheater Under the direction of Minister Friedrich Leopold von Schr√∂tter, construction of the Stadttheater began in 1806 in place of the former garrison church. Three years later King Frederick William III (reigned 1797 to 1840) transferred the garden from royal control to the city of K√∂nigsberg with the stipulation it not be developed. It subsequently developed into the fairest park of the city. King Frederick William IV (reigned 1840-1861) laid the foundation stone for the Neue Albertina, the new campus of the University of K√∂nigsberg, along Paradeplatz's north in 1844; the new campus was dedicated in 1861. Military drills ended in 1848, allowing the park to often be used by actors. The K√∂nigshalle was used by royalists led by Lt. General Bernhard Joachim von Plehwe during the revolution of 1848. The former drilling house was used as an exhibition hall by a polytechnical society in 1853 and subsequently dismantled. An equestrian statue of Frederick William III was installed by the campus on 3 August 1851, while the memorial to Immanuel Kant by Christian Daniel Rauch was moved from before the castle to the garden's southwest in 1885. Lines of chestnut and lime trees were planted along three sides of Paradeplatz, to which were also added lawns and lilac.Albinus, p. 239 Parades celebrating the birthday of Wilhelm II, German Emperor (reigned 1888 to 1918), were held in the park's south, while flea markets were held at Christmas time. Further horticultural development continued in 1920. Municipal authorities considered renamed the park K√∂nigsgarten again in 1884. Although they decided to keep it as Paradeplatz, the name K√∂nigsgarten continued in colloquial use. Monument to King Frederick William III of Prussia The southern wooded avenue Kastanienallee was cleared in the 1930s and replaced with a large square, which allowed the city's trams to connect Steindamm and Tragheim. This square was also used as a parade route by the Nazis. In 1935 the K√∂nigshalle became a garrison mess. Much of Paradeplatz, including the K√∂nigshalle and the Stadttheater, was destroyed during the 1944 Bombing of K√∂nigsberg in World War II. The Lasch Bunker, a military bunker constructed in the park in 1939, housed the staff of General Otto Lasch during the Battle of K√∂nigsberg. Lasch capitulated there to the Red Army on 9 April 1945. The former bunker is now used by the Kaliningrad Museum for History and Art. The former Neue Albertina campus is now used by Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University. Notes References * *Karl, G.

He bred new strains and varieties of plants, including fruits, flowers, and vegetables over his 70-year-long career. At the time of his death, one fourth of the watermelon seeds in the world were supplied by Chen. He developed over 280 varieties of new watermelon species including seedless watermelons, yellow skinned watermelons with red meat (called ‚ÄúDiana‚Äù), and baby watermelons. He became known as the ‚ÄúWatermelon King‚Äù because of his extensive work with watermelons. He established Known-You Seed Cooperation at 1968, also as director of Known- You Social Welfare Foundation since 1991. Chen Wen-yu bred the new species of oriental pickling melon. Chen Wen-yu (center) with his colleagues in a watermelon field. Early life  Born when Taiwan was under Japanese rule and raised in a rural village in Tainan's Yongkang District which is in southern Taiwan, Chen realized the hardships farmers experienced in his childhood. When he was 14, he decided that he would study agricultural technology to help improve farmers‚Äô lives. After he graduated from an agricultural school, he worked with Dr. Tsuneo Eguchi (Ê±üÂè£Â∫∏ÈõÑ) in FengShan Tropical Horticultural Experiment Branch of the Agricultural Research Institute, a department of the Council of Agriculture (COA) in Kaohsiung. During these time, He was inspired by Luther Burbank and Ivan Vladimirovich Michurin, who are pioneers in agricultural science. Two year later, he served in Japanese Army during the end of World War II. After war, he came back to FengShan Tropical Horticultural Experiment Branch again, doing plant breeding research. Recalling memories of his father's poor crops and the seeds they came from, Chen was devoted into the research and development of seeds better suited to Taiwan's climate and soil. This in turn led him to study cross-pollination techniques. With funding from the US Agency for International Development, he pursued advanced studies in horticulture at Chiba University in Japan. He later returned to Taiwan and founded the Kaohsiung-based Known-You Seed Co with his friends in 1968. The name ‚ÄúKnown-You‚Äù can be transliterated as ‚Äúfriends of farmers‚Äù in Taiwanese. Chen Wen-yu pictured in front of Known-You Seed Co. with friends. Work  Chen's company focuses on developing new varieties of watermelon seeds, but has also created around 1,100 new vegetable and fruit varieties, with 600 of them going into mass production. So far over 90 percent of watermelon seeds sold to farmers in Taiwan are created by Chen. Due to the species improvement he has made, watermelons are cultivated on the island in the four seasons and in various kinds of soils. Meanwhile, the US seed-testing organization All-America Selections, which is the oldest, most established international testing organization to promote new seed varieties in North America, rewarded a total seven awards for watermelons, four of which were from Known-You. The company has a seedling farm in the US and branch offices in China, India and several Southeast Asian countries such as Singapore and Thailand. Inspired by Chen Wen-yu's mentor, Dr. Tsuneo Eguchi who mentioned about helping farmers in southeastern Asia, Chen funded the establishment of a hospital ( Known-You Seed Farmers‚Äô Hospital) in Myanmar to provide free medical services for farmers there in 2001 and also set up a foundation to help improve local farmers‚Äô welfare. Seedless watermelon Chen Wen-yu was particularly interested in the theory of seedless watermelons proposed by the Japanese researcher Hitoshi Kihara in 1951, according to which crossing a female tetraploid plant (itself the product of genetic manipulation) with diploid pollen creates a triploid plant that is sterile, but can produce seedless fruit if pollenized by a diploid plant. Sound as the theory was, in practice none of the seed companies in Japan could successfully cultivate the seedless variety on a commercial scale. After incessant experimentation, in 1962 Chen succeeded in the first seedless watermelon in the world. The subsequent boom for Taiwan's seedless watermelons generated an annual export value of more than NT$100 million, and led to a new era of hybridity and crossbreeding in fruit and vegetables. Hobbies \\"You take lots effort to climb up to the top, but get lost at the end\\", extracted from \\"A-Ying's Drawing and Saying\\". Chen Wen-yu started \\"Known-Yu News\\" in order to encourage his colleagues to enjoy writing and painting.

The player moves the avatar through a 2D screen that changes based on the player's camera angle in 3D space. This perspective- shifting mechanic is used to reach a goal at the end of each level. When the player takes control of the camera angle, the 2D avatar is locked in place until the player decides to return to 2D mode. Overall, Perspective was very well received by critics, who singled out the unique game mechanics and level design as strong features.  Gameplay  The player's goal is to move an avatar to a goal. The game is played by switching between 2D and 3D modes: in 2D mode, the avatar can move but the field of view is fixed. In 3D mode, the player can move and change the field of view but the avatar is fixed in 3D space. Each level is made up of rooms and corridors with blue and orange platforms across the walls of the level. The avatar can walk on the blue platforms in 2D mode and is unable to pass through them. If the avatar touches an orange platform, it goes back to where it was before it entered 2D mode. No matter where the player is, the avatar always stays the same size in relation to the screen. As a result, the player is able to fit the avatar through spaces that appear to be impossible at first sight. The levels are organized using a main hub, which is a separate level in itself that has to be navigated in the same way as the regular levels. Each new level is unlocked when the previous one is beaten; levels generally increase in difficulty as the player progresses through the game. Some bonus levels are unlocked by completing regular levels.  Development  Perspective was made available for download for free on December 12, 2012. Development for the game began as a junior year school project on May 2011. None of the people working on the game were able to work on it full-time. Several developers had different goals when developing the game: The game was heavily inspired by Portal and borrows the tagline \\"Can you think with perspective?\\" from the game as well as the orange and blue color scheme. Other inspiration for level design came from Braid.  Reception  The game was praised by PC Gamer as \\"mind-bending\\". Indie Game Magazine praised it as \\"mind-blowing\\" and \\"excellent\\", and Blame It On The Voices called it \\"revolutionary\\". Rock, Paper, Shotgun called it \\"remarkably clever[,] not just in the idea itself ... but in the construction of the puzzles which make use of that concept.\\" According to Eurogamer, \\"Perspective looks to be an innovative puzzle/platformer\\". Gamezebo gave the game 5 out of 5, stating \\"the controls are spot on, the puzzles are consistently glorious, and it's all wrapped up in a neat little package.\\" At the 2013 Independent Games Festival, Perspective was a finalist in the Technical Excellence category.

In 1998, the book was awarded the annual William Allen White Children's Book Award. Plot summary Thirteen-year-old Phoebe Harte's younger brother, Mick, dies in a bicycle accident, because he chooses not to wear a helmet. This brings an incredible amount of grief and sorrow to the Harte family. The book, narrated by Phoebe herself, shows the effect Mick's death has on his friends and schoolmates, and delves deeply into the grieving process experienced by Phoebe and her parents. The book delivers some of Phoebe's fondest memories of Mick‚Äîmany of them relating the pranks that Mick enjoyed playing on his friends and family‚Äîin the form of anecdotes about when the two of them were younger. According to Publishers Weekly, Park demonstrates a tremendous ability \\"to convey so affectingly both the individual and collective pain of this family's members.\\" Park does this, not through melodrama, but rather through what Publishers Weekly calls a focus \\"on small moments\\", such as when Phoebe's father arrives home from the hospital and quietly closes the door to Mick's room. Reception Park's novella was well-reviewed. Publishers Weekly called it \\"a full-fledged and fully convincing drama\\", lauding \\"Park's ability to make the events excruciatingly real while entirely avoiding the mawkish.\\" In 1998, the book won the William Allen White Children's Book Award, an honor bestowed upon it by a vote of Kansas schoolchildren. Bicycle safety theme In addition to the aforementioned focus of the novella on the grieving process, another theme woven into the fabric of the novella is that of bicycle safety. The book strongly suggests that had Mick been wearing a bicycle helmet, he would not have died from his injuries. In one scene, as Phoebe is experiencing a sense of guilt over Mick's death, her father sighs heavily, and says quietly, \\"If only I had made him wear his helmet.\\" The theme is brought around again towards the end of the book, when Phoebe moves past her own pain and anger in what Publishers Weekly calls \\"a powerful scene in which Phoebe overcomes her own pain and anger to participate in a school assembly on bicycle safety.\\" However, Publishers Weekly also notes that the theme of bicycle safety \\"never dominates the story\\", and that Park never allows the book to descend into a maudlin \\"cautionary tale.\\" Footnotes References * * * See also Category:1995 American novels Category:1995 children's books Category:American children's novels ","title":"Mick Harte Was Here"},{"id":"37989559","text":"Makhdoom Ahmed Mehmood () is a Pakistani businessman and politician who is the chairman of JDW Group.

He and drummer Steve Goulding (The Rumour, The Mekons, etc) met and began playing together as a rhythm section while still at school. They spent their teenage years auditioning, busking and jamming whenever they could, and were gigging in and around London with a cajun-influenced band called Bontemps Roulez just prior to forming The Rumour in 1975. Bodnar is probably best known for his membership with Graham Parker and The Rumour (1975-1980), for playing the distinctive reggae-flavored bassline on \\"Watching the Detectives\\" by Elvis Costello, and for bass playing and co-writing (with Steve Goulding and Nick Lowe) ‚ÄúI Love the Sound of Breaking Glass‚Äù by Nick Lowe. Bodnar went on to become the Thompson Twins touring bassist, promoting their hit album ‚ÄòQuick Step & Side Kick‚Äô during 1982-83 and since played live, or on recording sessions for many artists, including Angie Bowie, The Pretenders, and Tina Turner. He also played bass for Graham Parker on his various solo albums from 1988 through the mid-1990s. Graham Parker and The Rumour reunited in 2011 to record two new albums, and they toured the UK, US and Europe through to late 2015.

The handmade, stop- motion game was created in a UK garage by Fat Pebble developers. In the game, players guide a clay ball over a series of hills with the objective of squashing monsters on the way down. As of November 2018 the game is no longer available on the App Store and Google Play Store.  Gameplay  The goal of the game is to squash as many clay monsters as possible. As the clay ball rolls down a hill, the ball grows larger and rolls faster as it squashes beasts. As the ball nears the end of the course, players try to flick it as far as possible. The further the ball goes, the more points a player scores, enabling them to unlock new levels, themes and monsters. The game includes a total of 130 quests and five hills to master. The base game is free to play, and all the content can be unlocked by playing the game or through in-app purchases.  Development  Clay Jam is Brighton, England-based developer Fat Pebble's first game as an independent studio. To produce the game's graphics, art director Chris Roe modeled monsters out of 44 pounds of clay and used 400 toothpicks to scaffold the designs. Roe created the claymation scenes in his garage, taking 2040 stop-motion frames. Everyday objects were used to create the sound effects and local musicians were employed to produce the game's music. Zynga published Clay Jam on November 29, 2012, for iOS and Android as its first claymation title. The game is the fifth title in the Zynga Partners for Mobile program, Zynga's effort to help third parties publish mobile games while increasing Zynga's presence on mobile devices. Launched in June 2012, the partnership includes Fat Pebble, Atari, Crash Lab, Phosphor Games Studio and Sava Transmedia.

It is the sequel to the 2001 game Toki Tori. The game was originally announced in December 2011 with an intended release for Spring 2012 for Steam and iOS devices (and was later announced as a Wii U game), but the game was pushed back due to longer than expected development times. The game was released on April 4, 2013 for Wii U and on July 11, 2013 on Steam for Windows and for Mac OS X. On September 12, 2013, an updated version called Toki Tori 2+ was released for the Wii U, adding new music and puzzles. Toki Tori 2+ made its Linux debut with Humble Bundle X launched on January 3, 2014. The game was later released in Japan and published by Rainy Frog on September 3, 2014. Toki Tori 2+ launched for the Nintendo Switch on February 23, 2018. Gameplay The gameplay in Toki Tori 2 is very different compared to its predecessor, the main difference being the absence of items for Toki Tori to use. These are replaced by two skills that Toki Tori has during the game that are used to manipulate the environment and the creatures within it, the first one being Whistle which generally causes creatures to move closer to Toki Tori as well as being used to whistle songs that perform various actions. The other ability available to Toki Tori is Stomp. Stomp generally scares creatures into moving away from Toki Tori as well as breaking some parts of the environment. There are also other elements that make up the game, for example if Toki Tori walks into water his feathers will become wet which can then be used for other tasks such as walking through cut grass while wet will cause it to grow so it can be used.Toki Tori 2+ ingame screenshot The game also features various features that are new to the series, one of these features being the Tokidex. The Tokidex is one of the collectables in the game, as the game is played the player can use a song to bring up the camera which is controlled via the Wii U controller (or through the keyboard on the computer version). This camera is then used to take pictures of the creatures that appear in the world, the player is rewarded for collecting pictures of every creature in the game. Development Before the game was announced it was hinted at numerous times by Two Tribes, the main example of this was a QR Code that could be found in the Windows/Mac port of Edge which led to a countdown timer, when this countdown timer ended it changed to show a picture of a buried Toki Tori skeleton with a hole in the ground next to it.Toki Tori 2 Dig Picture http://www.twotribes.com/09d6ee2cea36f247/ After the countdown ended, Toki Tori 2 was announced shortly after. When the game was announced was when work was started on the game and at this point Two Tribes invited fans to become part of the development process by providing access to an alpha build of the game through Steam, this started off as a concept art viewer but as new features for the game were created they were implemented into the alpha, such as the level editor. Two Tribes also implemented an input recording function in the alpha which allowed them to ask players to complete tasks or levels in the alpha and then send their recording to Two Tribes for it to be used to improve the game as well as fix bugs. The level editor for the Wii U was cancelled due to lower than anticipated sales and various technical difficulties. On October 22, 2013, Two Tribes announced that the planned iOS version was cancelled. On February 16, 2018, Toki Tori 2+ appeared for pre-order on the Nintendo Switch eShop without prior announcements, and officially launching for the platform seven days later in North America, Europe, and Australia. Two Tribes claims it is the definite version of the game, and runs at 1080p in TV Mode and 720p in Handheld Mode and 60 fps and comes with new secrets, HD Rumble, and video capture support. The pre-order came with an introductory price (9.99 $ instead of 14.99 $).  Reception  Toki Tori 2 received positive reviews. IGN praised the game for its exploration, graphics and subtle controls meanwhile criticising the game for its slow pace and lack of action. Joystiq also praised the game for explorative and non hand holding nature, beautiful artwork and brain-bending puzzles. Nintendo World Report praised the game for its vibrant game play.

One of the most prestigious libraries of the eastern German Sprachraum, comparable only to the , in Breslau in Silesia of then southeastern Germany, (now renamed Wroclaw in southwestern Poland since World War II).Hanowell, p. 106 K√∂nigsberg University's developed since the 16th century out of several smaller libraries. It was destroyed in 1944 during World War II in the invasion by the Soviet Union after which the city was occupied and renamed Kaliningrad. History Chamber Library Albert, Duke of Prussia (1490-1568), founded the Chamber Library (Kammerbibliothek) or German Library (Deutsche Bibliothek) above the gate of K√∂nigsberg Castle ca. 1526 with about 100 smaller works.Hanowell, p. 107 Its first director was the ducal secretary Balthasar Gans.Karl Lohmeyer in Altpreussische Monatsschrift, p. 595 Because Albert only had rudimentary knowledge of the Latin language, the collection contained German books and German language translations of foreign texts. Its authors were among the most influential of the Protestant Reformation of the 15th century, including Martin Luther, Lazarus Spengler, Martin Bucer, Johann von Staupitz, Andreas Karlstadt, , Johannes Oecolampadius, and Urbanus Rhegius. Other volumes included legal, historical, geographical, and medical topics. By the end of Albert's life, the ducal Chamber Library had expanded to 500 volumes. The Chamber Library was passed to the Castle Library in 1583. Silver Library Depiction of Duke Albert of Prussia (1490-1568) on a silver cover The most cherished part of the Chamber Library was the Silver Library (Silberbibliothek). Initially only two of Albert's volumes were bound with plates of embossed silver by silversmiths, but it expanded to twenty after the duke's second marriage in 1550 to Anna Marie of Brunswick-L√ºneburg. Besides the splendid Lutheran Bible by Cornelius Vorwend of Nuremberg, there were also three works by Paul Hoffmann, six by Gerhard Lenz, and five by Hieronymus K√∂sler, the latter three all being from K√∂nigsberg.Gause I, p. 247 On 20 August 1611 the Silver Library passed to the directors of the Castle Library.B√∂tticher, p. 150 It was temporarily evacuated to K√ºstrin during the Seven Years' War (1756-1763), to Memel (later renamed Klaipeda) during the War of the Fourth Coalition (1806-1807) in the world-wide Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815), and to Berlin during World War I (1914-1918). Since 1924 it was exhibited as part of the Teutonic Knights museum within K√∂nigsberg Castle. It was moved to the manor in Karwinden during World War II (1939-1945) but was lost amidst the battle damage of the war on the Eastern Front with the invasion by the Soviet Union. Castle Library Encouraged by the influx of educated persons to K√∂nigsberg, Albert established for academics the Castle Library (Schlo√übibliothek) or New Library (Neue Bibliothek, Bibliotheca nova), the core of the later State Library, alongside his private Chamber Library in 1529. Crotus Rubeanus of Thuringia gathered 63 mostly Latin and Greek volumes from 70 authors. It grew in size to require a librarian, the efficient Felix K√∂nig (Rex) of Ghent, also known as Polyphemus, who instituted systematic and alphabetical catalogs. The date of Polyphemus's start, 5 December 1534, has been regarded as the informal beginning of the library.Centralblatt, p. 346 Albert made the Castle Library public in 1540, an act celebrated by theologians and humanists and praised by Wilhelm Gnapheus in Latin poetry.Gause I, p. 276 At that time it contained 1,600 titles in 800 volumes. Writing in the ', considered the K√∂nigsberg Castle Library to be the first public library in Europe, older than the Bodleian Library which opened publicly in 1602. Between 1541-43 the Castle Library also acquired the Ordensbibliothek, the library of the Teutonic Knights previously located in Tapiau. By the time of Polyphemus's death in 1549, the Castle Library counted 2,400 works in 1,200 volumes. The immediate successors of Polyphemus were Martin Chemnitz of Treuenbrietzen (worked 1550-53) and David Milesius of Neisse. The Castle Library flourished through the leadership of Heinrich Zell (worked 1557-64), who added 1,000 volumes and reorganized it. It was possibly by a suggestion of Zell that Albert decreed in 1557 that a copy of all books printed in Prussia be included within the Castle Library; legal deposit continued until 1945.Gause I, p. 277 Successors of Zell were Johann Steinbach (worked 1564-66), of Danzig (worked 1566-85), and of Danzig. The Castle Library acquired the Chamber Library in 1583 and the Silver Library in 1611. Under the leadership of Menius ca. 1600, the Schlossbibliothek acquired 204 legal volumes and 196 theological volumes. It began to stagnate in 1618 after the inheritance of the Duchy of Prussia by the Margraviate of Brandenburg, however; the Hohenzollern rulers focused on developing the libraries of Berlin instead of K√∂nigsberg. From 1621-58 only 343 volumes were added to the latter. At the end of the 17th century it acquired the collection of Bogus≈Çaw Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç. Wallenrodt Library The ' (Wallenrodtsche Bibliothek) of K√∂nigsberg Cathedral was established by the 17th century ducal chancellor (1570‚Äì1632), whose first collection of 3,000 volumes was destroyed by fire in 1623. Martin began a second collection which reached 2,000 volumes by his death and was then continued by his son, (1632‚Äì1696), who added another 1,000 volumes. Ernst von Wallenrodt (1651‚Äì1735) donated 2,000 more volumes in 1718.Hanowell, p. 109 Librarians included the professor Christian Heinrich G√ºtther (worked 1738-55), (worked 1756-63), Carl Andreas Christiani (worked 1763-80), law professor (worked 1780-85), and .Gause II, p. 242 Rudolf Reicke counted 10,334 volumes, including 200 manuscripts and 85 incunabula. The Wallenrodt Library was incorporated into the State and University Library in 1909, with 7,000 volumes taken by the Mitteltragheim facility and 3,500 volumes remaining in K√∂nigsberg Cathedral.Kazimir K. Lavrinoviƒç in K√∂nigsberger Buch- und Bibliotheksgeschichte, p. 330 The latter were destroyed by the August 1944 bombing of K√∂nigsberg in World War II. University Library The University Library (Universit√§tsbibliothek) was established in 1544 as a small academic library for the Albertina, the new University of K√∂nigsberg.Edwards, p. 467 However, it was for long overshadowed by the Chamber and Castle Libraries.Axel E. Walter in Die Universit√§t K√∂nigsberg in der Fr√ºhen Neuzeit, p. 267 It began to expand during the Age of Enlightenment through private efforts, rather than state support.Hanowell, p. 108 Michael Lilienthal (1686‚Äì1750) was a librarian at the start of the 18th century, while during the administration of Martin Sylvester Grabe the Younger (1674‚Äì1727) it acquired 800 volumes. The theologian librarians Johannes Behm (lived 1687-1753) and Friedrich Samuel Bock (1716‚Äì85) added 1,744 and 2,469 volumes, respectively. From 1765-72 Immanuel Kant served as an assistant librarian. The physicist Karl Daniel Reusch was librarian from 1779 to 1806. The University Library often received donations, such as the 3,000 volume and coin collection of the mathematician David Bl√§sing (1660‚Äì1719), the substantial collection of Professor C√∂lestin Kowalewski (lived 1700-71), part of the theologian Georg Christoph Pisanski's estate, and a donation from the Tilsit merchant Johann Daniel Gordack in 1790. The University Library of that era was detrimentally located in two rooms within K√∂nigsberg Castle between the Schlosskirche and a tower. The library was only open two days a week for three hours, and was not open at all during the winter of 1772/73 because Bock did not want to work during the cold. By the end of Bock's service in 1779, the library's collection of manuscripts and incunabula had expanded to 14,000. The University Library received the collection of the Etatsministerium in 1805, as that government ministry had been dissolved the previous year. The library also acquired the collection of the Deutsche Gesellschaft. Georg Heinrich Ludwig Nicolovius was only librarian from 1807‚Äì09, but his effective administration acquired 2,832 volumes, more than Reusch had managed over a much longer time. The history collection was predominant, followed by theology and philology. German and European classics first began to appear during the stewardship of Nicolovius. 19th century In 1810 during the era of Prussian reforms, several of the city's collections, including the Castle Library, University Library, Public Library, and Keyserling Library, moved to the K√∂nigshaus, a royal palace built for King Frederick William I in 1731 in Neue Sorge.Albinus, p. 324 The Castle Library thus became the Royal Library (K√∂nigliche Bibliothek) on 21 February 1810 and was administered by a university curatorship. The royal and university libraries were united as the Royal and University Library (K√∂nigliche- und Universit√§tsbibliothek) in 1827.B√∂tticher, p. 149 The Keyserling Library moved to Rautenberg in 1821, while the Public Library moved to Kneiphof in 1875. The library counted amongst its donations the personal collection of Johann Friedrich Herbart (1776‚Äì1841). In 1858 the bibliophile Friedrich August Gotthold (lived 1839-80), director of the Collegium Fridericianum, donated his personal collection of 36,000 volumes to the library. Gotthold's collection included belles-lettres, classical philology, pedagogy, history, geography, and music since the Renaissance. In 1860 it received the collection of its chief librarian, Christian August Lobeck (1781‚Äì1860). In 1890 the Royal and University Library counted 263,636 volumes. Collections and Nachl√§sse acquired around the turn of the century included Friedrich Zanders (1811‚Äì94), Gustav Hirschfeld (1847‚Äì95), Jakob Caro (1835‚Äì1904), and August Hagen (1834‚Äì1910). The Nachlass of the philosopher Johann Georg Hamann (1730‚Äì88), the Magus of the North, was added in 1905. 20th century The Royal and University Library moved from Neue Sorge to Tragheim in 1901. The new institution was built in Mitteltragheim in place of the Baroque Braxein-Tettau Palace once owned by the apothecary and councilor August Wilhelm Hensche. The adjoining road Henschestra√üe was named in his honor. Librarians included Fritz Milkau and Ernst Kuhnert. In 1909 it added the Wallenrodt Library, the preeminent noble and civil service collection of the province. The institution became the State and University Library (Staats- und Universit√§tsbibliothek) after the abdication of the House of Hohenzollern in 1918. Kuhnert published a history of the library in 1926.Gause II, p. 634 Other collections affiliated with the united library were that of K√∂nigsberg ObservatoryEdwards, 468 and the Handbibliothek for use by students. In 1939 the State and University Library contained 685,000 volumes. At the start of 1944 many of the library's most valued collections were evacuated to nearby palaces and manors. The library itself was destroyed during the August 1944 Bombing of K√∂nigsberg in World War II. Surviving texts were subsequently acquired by Soviet and Polish experts and institutions.

As of the 2010 census, its population was 429. Alcolu has a post office with ZIP code 29001, which opened on August 17, 1888. It developed as a lumber and mill town. History Alcolu was established between 1885 and 1890 by D.W. Alderman as a company mill town; it was developed to house the employees of his timber company and lumber mill. These were located in a relatively isolated area. The name Alcolu is derived from \\"AL\\" for Alderman, \\"CO\\" for Coldwell (a friend), and \\"LU\\" for Lula,https://www.scpictureproject.org/tag/alcolu then the only daughter of D.W. Alderman and his wife. When it was built, Alcolu was a company town where everybody worked in one of the various businesses of D.W. Alderman & Sons. The business grew to encompass logging operations, a saw mill, planing mill, hosiery mill, flooring mill, and extensive farming and cattle ranching. They also ran a cotton gin, hotel, company store, and several other businesses. Over time, the company helped found schools and churches, and built baseball fields, an electric plant, and a telephone system for the town. D.W. Alderman also founded the Alcolu and the Paroda railroads, and built the Alcolu railroad depot. The Alcolu Post Office was established on August 17, 1888. His friend Algernon Coldwell was appointed as its first Postmaster. Company employees were paid in \\"babbits\\", a metal coin stamped with an \\"A\\", which could be used only in the company store. There they could buy groceries, see the doctor, get a haircut, or watch a show in the 200-seat auditorium upstairs. In 1919, the company opened the \\"Alderman 20 Stores in One\\" in nearby Manning, South Carolina. It was one of the first department stores in South Carolina and boasted of having the first elevator in town. In 1947, the Alderman family sold the lumber mill to the Southern Coatings & Chemical Company and the Williams Furniture Company. They, in turn, were bought more than two decades later in 1968 by the Georgia-Pacific company. Georgia-Pacific continued its operations in Alcolu until 2000, when the mill was finally closed. According to the 2010 census, the unincorporated town of Alcolu had a population of 429 people. Geography Alcolu is located in northern Clarendon County, north of Manning, the county seat. The southern edge of the CDP follows Interstate 95, which provides access at Exit 122. I-95 leads northeast to Florence and southwest to Santee. U.S. Route 521 runs through Alcolu, leading south to Manning and northwest to Sumter.

Built in 1961, it had a congregation active in the Civil Rights Movement of the 20th century and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. Established in 1865 by Reverend W. M. Grimes, a white minister, Canaan Baptist is among the oldest African-American Baptist congregations in Bessemer. Many of its congregation had belonged to the white- dominated Canaan Baptist Church before the American Civil War but, with freedom, wanted to have an independent congregation. Southern African-American congregations soon set up state Baptist associations, aided by churches in the Midwest, and eventually the National Baptist Convention (which split in the 20th century).Brooks, Walter H. \\"The Evolution of the Negro Baptist Church.\\" Journal of Negro History (1922) 7#1 pp: 11-22. in JSTOR The \\"white\\" Canaan Baptist church also still operates in Bessemer as part of the Southern Baptist Convention. Canaan Baptist Church in Bessemer was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005 for its role as a locally significant property and key strategy center in the city during the Civil Rights Movement in the Birmingham area from the early to mid-1960s. The African-American congregation of Canaan Baptist has occupied this lot in downtown Bessemer since 1889. The first church building on the current lot, at the corner of 9th Avenue and 15th Street, was opened in 1940 during the ministry of Reverend E. L. Plant. It was completed until 1947. The following year the Reverend Dr. J. H. Browder became the minister of Canaan Baptist Church. The present church building, constructed in 1961, is the second on the lot and was built under the direction of Rev. Browder, with George Wilson of Selma, Alabama, as the contractor.  Role in the Civil Rights Movement  Under the leadership of Reverend Dr. J. H. Browder, who was pastor of Canaan Baptist from 1948 until his death in March 1964, the congregation was active in the civil rights movement. Reverend Browder significantly expanded the public outreach and service of the church. He improved church administration and greatly expanded educational programs, establishing a youth department and educational department, a Christian Aid Union, a Sunday School program, and a Matrons Department. He also was active, along with other members of the congregation, in the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights in the late 1950s. Rev. Browder and Canaan Baptist gained a reputation locally for being a strong voice for equal rights, voting rights, and public desegregation at a time when African Americans were segregated by law and custom. They had been effectively disenfranchised under the state constitution since the late 19th century. Rev. Browder preached equality and fairness from the pulpit every Sunday. He strongly supported local efforts to desegregate schools after the United States Supreme Court's ruling in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional as a denial of due process and equal rights. Due to its public positions during the early civil rights period, the members of Canaan attracted considerable attention from white officials. In 1959, the City of Bessemer abruptly condemned the church's building, which had been first built in 1889 and expanded in 1908. The twin- tower church was an African-American landmark within Bessemer and the congregation had ensured that it received numerous updates and improvements during the Browder years to keep it safe and comfortable. But, in 1958 two other black churches in the city had been destroyed by fires, which city officials claimed resulted from construction and wiring deficiencies. (Local African Americans believed that the fires were not accidental, as bombings of black churches and ministers' homes by KKK chapters was prevalent during these years in Birmingham and had already occurred in Bessemer. On April 28, 1957, the Allen Temple AME Church, at Ninth Avenue and 22nd Street, suffered a dynamite blast at the rear of the church during an evening service. There were no fatalities.CHANDA TEMPLE and JEFF HANSEN, \\"Ministers' homes, churches among bomb targets\\" , AL.com, 16 July 2000, accessed 3 February 2015) The city government condemned the historic building of Canaan Baptist as unsafe. The congregation was forced to build a new one-story contemporary brick structure in 1960-61. Rev. Browder made this an opportunity to expand the church's vital role in providing social and educational services for African Americans in Bessemer. For example, the segregated African-American public schools in Bessemer were not funded to support a kindergarten for black children. Rev. Browder organized a kindergarten for local children, which met in the basement of the 1961 church building. The new building, with its basement meeting rooms and the large sanctuary, became a strategy center for the congregation. It discussed and planned its role in such pivotal events in the greater Birmingham area as the Selective Buying Campaign of 1962, by which black residents boycotted stores that discriminated against them; the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in Birmingham in 1962, and the Project C (\\"Confrontation\\") demonstrations of 1963, intended to fill the jails with civil rights protesters in Birmingham and Bessemer.History: \\"1963 January- June\\", Civil Rights Movement Veterans website After Rev. Browder's death in 1964, Rev. A. L. Bratcher became the minister. He led the church into a significant local role in implementing aspects of the civil rights movement in Bessemer. Reverend Bratcher helped the church become involved in the federal War on Poverty through using the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964. Through the creation of a Community Action Agency headquartered at the church, the congregation in 1964 established a Community Development Credit Union (CDCU), which still operates from the church in the 21st century. The Canaan Baptist CDCU was one of the first developed in the nation; it was eventually part of a national program of approximately 400 credit unions created between 1965 and 1973. It provided equal opportunity loans to local residents, who otherwise were discriminated against by local banks for the purchases of houses and the development of local businesses. The Community Action Agency also worked with congregation members and local residents on implementing the federal legislation of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act. Rev. Horace P. Turner became pastor at Canaan Baptist in December 1969 and continued as pastor to the end of the century. Under his leadership, the congregation built the educational annex in 1984, which provided new office space for the church's religious and social programs. The Canaan Baptist Church is considered a locally significant strategy center for church buildings as part of Birmingham's Civil Rights Movement, 1933-1979.

Created by head writer Josh Griffith, the role is portrayed by international model Redaric Williams. Executive producer Jill Farren Phelps introduced him during the episode that aired on December 17, 2012 as the younger brother of lawyer Leslie Michaelson (Angell Conwell). Tyler's storyline saw him become a potential threat to the marriage of Lily and Cane Ashby (Christel Khalil and Daniel Goddard). However, a story arc about Tyler and Leslie's past occurs, revealing that their father Gus Rogan (Tony Todd) was wrongly convicted for the murder of their mother, Belinda, and they changed their names, originally being Davis and Valerie. Casting In August 2012, with the installation of new executive producer Jill Farren Phelps and head writer Josh Griffith, The Young and the Restless released a casting call for the contract role of \\"Tyler Douglas\\". A casting call released for the role of Lily led to speculation that the producers were recasting the role of Lily's brother, Devon Hamilton, portrayed by Bryton James. However, Phelps later confirmed that Tyler was a new character. Williams' audition tape would later surface revealing some very crucial information about the character. Initially, Tyler \\"Douglas\\" was to be introduced as the nephew of Sarge Wilder (Darnell Williams) and interacts with Lily when he starts working at Jabot Cosmetics. Later, Griffith stated that the character's familial relationship to Sarge was subject to change. After much speculation, Soap Opera Digest later revealed that the character would be the younger brother of Leslie Michaelson. In October, it was confirmed that Williams had been cast in the role; he taped his first scenes during the week of November 5, and was scheduled to begin airing on December 12. According to legendary casting director Judy Blye Wilson, despite Williams being very well known as a model, he was not on the soap opera's radar. Williams' manager heard about the casting call and had the actor upload his audition tape to his personal YouTube channel so Wilson could see it. Williams later revealed that after sending in his audition tape, he was contacted by the series to screen test with Khalil and Goddard. Williams made his first onscreen appearance on December 17, 2012. After a short time on a recurring status, Williams was placed on contract. He stated that he had \\"mixed emotions\\" of signing a contract, saying that he was \\"a little concerned\\" about being \\"locked in for years\\", but added: \\"On the other hand, knowing how this industry is, it felt good to have job security.\\" Williams was taken off contract in 2014, and was last seen on September 30. Development Characterization The initial casting call described Tyler's age as being in his late 20s or early 30s. Tyler becomes an orphan at the age of 16 and works his way through college to get an MBA. Williams said that, \\"He's driven to succeed. Smart, energetic. Well-read. Smoothly sexy and confident, with a witty, sometimes cynical sense of humor.\\" In an interview with Soap Opera Digest, Williams described the character as being a confident, well-rounded, and ambitious, \\"streetmart guy\\", with intelligence. However, the character is also very impatient. Tyler is \\"Quick to draw, quick to shoot,\\" with a marketing and design background that makes him very appealing to the corporate raiders of Genoa City. According to Williams, Tyler at first may come off as a bad guy, and compared him to \\"a bull in a china shop\\". Williams described Tyler \\"as not your typical schooled cookie-cutter graphic designer. He is an artsy and urban art guy.\\" CBS Daytime's senior vice-president, Angelica McDaniel, described the character as a \\"young and hip\\" artist who understands the power of social media and marketing. Williams stated that Tyler has a \\"strong presence\\", and can be a \\"live wire\\". Tyler is \\"agenda driven, and he is not just there to cause trouble\\". Williams explained that what appealed to him the most was that Tyler's personality gave him a lot of freedom in his portrayal of the character. According to McDaniel, the character has many layers that will need to be explored. In an interview with Deanna Barnet of TV Buzz, Williams categorized Tyler as being a \\"social chameleon\\" and explained that Tyler is capable of adapting to any social setting. He stated: \\"He's kind of a square peg in a round hole.\\" However, instead of adapting to his environment, he tries to change that environment. If met with disapproval, Tyler changes his approach. According to Williams, Tyler isn't easily shaken and he's \\"seasoned by life\\". According to Williams, Tyler is confident \\"because he knows he's competent\\". If Tyler feels that \\"he is coming off as cocky, which is often, then he will back off\\". Williams explained to Rolling Out magazine that Tyler's overconfident demeanor is his way of hiding his pain. Despite what may appear on the surface, Williams feels the character has a good heart. \\"He's developing, as a human being. He's coming of age. He's a man. And he's now in a new environment‚Ä¶\\" Secret past According to Williams, Leslie and Tyler are very comfortable with one another and have a very playful relationship. In an interview with Soaps In Depth, Williams compared Tyler and Leslie's relationship to his relationship with his real life sister, who is also a lawyer. Leslie is very patient with Tyler and has always \\"coddled him,\\" according to Conwell. When Tyler must finally face his father, \\"[Leslie] feels she has to treat him like the little brother again.\\" In February 2013, Angelica McDaniel confirmed that several stories would climax during the celebration of the show's 40th anniversary, including the story about Tyler and Leslie's past; \\"[‚Ä¶] Tyler and Leslie have some sort of [secret] history that will come to fruition.\\" In January 2013 when Mark Pinter joined the cast as Congressman Marcus Wheeler, an associate of popular characters, Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) and Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman), Tyler and Leslie's past is explored. While Leslie is terrified to see Wheeler, Tyler initially doesn't think it's a big deal. It is eventually revealed that Tyler and Leslie were born, Davis and Valerie Rogan. The teenagers change their names after Valerie is forced to testify against their father for killing their mother Belinda. Their father is convicted thanks to Valerie and Wheeler's testimonies. When Tyler learns that their father trying to get an appeal, he wants to reveal his true identity and testify against him, but Leslie urges him not to as she questions their father's guilt. In late December 2012, veteran actor, Tony Todd, known for his starring role as the Candyman in the horror franchise confirmed that he had been cast in the role of Tyler and Leslie's incarcerated father, Gus Rogan. Soaps In Depth revealed that Gus's arrival would stir up trouble for his children. In the meantime, Tyler changes his tune about wanting to testify against his father as he is faced with the reality of Gus's release. With Gus's exoneration, Tyler cannot pretend everything is \\"OK\\" just because Gus did not kill their mother. According to Williams, \\"Tyler is being asked to be somebody else\\" and he's already gone through that. However, Tyler is pretty much fearless so he will have no choice but to \\"bite the bullet\\" and deal with his father. Tyler gets drunk and reminisces with a photo of himself and Leslie as children. According to Williams, \\"[Tyler]'s feeling like he's losing his sister.\\" It is the first time Tyler and Leslie have not been in one another's corner, and him being estranged from his sister is such unfamiliar territory for him that he starts to lose it. For so long, Tyler thought Gus was responsible for Belinda's death and when all of that suddenly changes, \\"it's kind of a cool place to be in as an actor!\\" said Williams. Romance Williams revealed to TV Source that Tyler falling in love is \\"a stretch.\\" Tyler views himself as being in a \\"tunnel\\" and \\"love is this little glimmer off in the distance.\\" Though Tyler still looks for love, according to Williams, finding it would be anything but smooth. Tyler is in a constant state of metamorphosis: \\"What you see right now is not what you‚Äôre going to get.\\" In December 2012, head writer, Josh Griffith revealed that Tyler would set his sights on Lily in the New Year. However, Tyler's initial interest in Lily seems to be just for kicks. He's new in town and has nothing to lose by flirting with Lily, even if she's married. However, Tyler does not expect his flirting to become something genuine, and he embraces that \\"realness\\" of his bond with Lily. According to Williams, Lily is \\"special.\\" Lily sees beyond his hard exterior, and finds his vulnerability. When Tyler is honest about his past, Lily's comfort strikes a nerve with Cane. Tyler's intentions with Lily are not clear cut, which adds to the storyline's unpredictability. The genuine feelings leads to a kiss when Tyler is in need of comfort. When Tyler tries to walk away from Jabot for her, she confesses her feelings, and \\"things come to a head.\\" Tyler tries to cover up his feelings for Lily by dating other women including Quinn (Victoria Barabas) who serves as an outlet for Tyler when he is faced with his father's mortality. The writers soon began developing Tyler's relationship with Melissa Ordway's Abby Newman. According to Williams, Tyler is \\"intrigued\\" by Abby's unpredictable nature and said that their natural attraction could lead to romance. However, Williams hinted that Tyler's interest in Abby could be his attempt to \\"suppress his feelings\\" for Lily. Storylines After Leslie sets up an impromptu job interview with her boss and Jabot Cosmetics CEO, Neil Winters (Kristoff St. John), Tyler is hired to help with marketing. Though Tyler has great ideas, his flirtatious behavior with Neil's daughter Lily doesn't sit well with her husband Cane. Tyler also gets a job marketing new night club The Underground. Tyler and Leslie's past unravels with the arrival of Marcus Wheeler (Mark Pinter). It is revealed that their father Gus (Tony Todd) who was convicted of their mother's murder is looking for an appeal. Upon Gus's release, Tyler has trouble adjusting, and he is shocked when Wheeler is arrested for his mother's murder instead. Just when Tyler lets his father in, Gus dies. In the meantime, Tyler bonds with Lily and begins to fall for her. After a kiss, Tyler sees she is overwhelmed and backs off. However, Tyler cannot deny his feelings and decides to quit his job; instead Lily agrees to work in another division. When Tyler and Devon butt heads over decisions for a campaign, Tyler accuses Neil of nepotism and ends up getting fired. Fortunately he finds another job based in New York that allows him to work from Wisconsin. Tyler befriends Noah Newman (Robert Adamson) and they get an apartment together. In addition, Tyler begins dating Noah's aunt, Abby (Melissa Ordway). In the meantime, a mystery blogger begins targeting Lily's entire family even insinuating that Lily is jealous of Tyler and Abby's relationship. After Thanksgiving, Tyler thanks Lily for helping him find love in another person. Afterward, Tyler reveals to Abby that he was engaged to a woman named Mariah who keeps telephoning him. Abby becomes jealous and threatened when Tyler struggles to cut Mariah out of his life. The two travel to Los Angeles for Christmas, during which a mysterious woman goes into their hotel room. Abby believes the woman to be Mariah, which Tyler continuously denies. Reception Jillian Bowe applauded the initial casting and praised the official casting announcement. Jamey Giddens praised Williams' audition tape and along with other critics applauded the writers for introducing Tyler as Leslie's brother, adding a new African American family to canvas. Entertainment Weekly said Williams's casting was reminiscent of the Shemar Moore casting in 1994 and said the Tyler character could help fans get past Moore's 2005 departure. Rolling Out Magazine said like Moore's Malcolm, \\"Tyler is that bad guy-good guy.\\" Williams was \\"flattered\\" by the comparison but he did not agree with it. In November 2012, Sheryl Underwood of CBS Daytime's The Talk stated that Williams was worthy of People magazine's Sexiest Man Alive title and co-host Julie Chen even extended an invitation to Williams to appear on the talk show. On December 7, Williams appeared on The Talk along with costars Ignacio Serricchio, Lamon Archey and Marco Dapper to discuss their new roles. Williams who posted the video of his audition on his own personal YouTube channel was forced to take the video down when it attracted too much attention. We Loves Soaps named Williams as the \\"Sexiest Male\\" in Daytime for the year 2012. Y&R;'s casting director, Judy Blye Wilson described Williams as a \\"real natural\\" and applauded the actor for being able to make the transition from modeling to acting so easily. Williams's hiring also garnered the attention from other casting directors inquiring about where Wilson found him. Williams, along with several other high-profile castings helped Wilson win her 11th Artios Award from the Casting Society of America. In 2014, Williams was nominated for NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actor in a Daytime Drama Series. During a press conference for the show's 40th anniversary, CBS Daytime's senior vice-president Angelica McDaniel accredited Williams and the other new younger hires as complements to the already very talented cast. McDaniel included Williams as being part of the \\"next generation\\" that would help the show thrive in the future. Tyler's potential romance with Lily received mixed reviews. Some embraced the potential pairing, while others were a bit cynical believing like past regimes, the new bosses would fold under the pressure of Lane (Cane and Lily)'s fans. Sara Bibel stated that the character had proven to be a formidable potential love interest for Lily and Jamey Giddens agreed describing Tyler as the more \\"palpable\\" threat to the couple compared Cane's sketchy past. However, majority of Soaps In Depth readers disagreed; according to a poll in the February 25, 2013 issue, 65% of fans said that Tyler would not be able to come between Cane and Lily. Meanwhile, some fans questioned the writers' motives. Other viewers believed Lily falling for Tyler would make her look naive, while some believed Tyler would run away from Lily because she was a mother, with others concluding that Tyler was not Lily's type. Soaps In Depth described Lily and Tyler getting stuck in the elevator as unrealistic because neither used a cellphone and said the scene \\"came across as very unnatural to the viewer!\\" Viewers and critics also praised the plot centered around Leslie and Tyler's secret past. Sara Bibel said it made her care about Tyler (and Leslie) as a family. Bibel appreciated that the characters were not being isolated, like the African American characters of the past had been. Tyler and Leslie were also listed at #3 in the \\"5 Things We're Loving\\" section. \\"Leslie and Tyler are as sexy as their hush-hush past is intriguing\\" said the article. Sara Bibel later commented that Tyler and Leslie's visit with a falsely accused and incarcerated Gus was one of the highlights during the week of Y&R;'s anniversary.

The St. John's Church Historic District in Richmond, Virginia includes several churches of various denominations, including this former Catholic convent and school which is a contributing property that continues to address the area's spiritual and educational needs. History In 1737, explorer and future planter William Byrd II named the future city from near this site on the highest of Richmond's hills. It overlooks the James River near its fall-line and faces the setting sun. The view reminded Byrd of his home Richmond-on- Thames. Native peoples called the area Tsenacomoco. Byrd commissioned Col. William Mayo to survey and lay out a city, and the survey lines remain in legal descriptions to this day. The area known alternately as Church Hill or Richmond Hill was first developed by Richard Adams, a friend of Thomas Jefferson, beginning in 1769. Adams built a house, probably across the street from the current property, when Richmond was declared Virginia's capital in 1779. British troops occupied the wood frame house during the American Revolution. Around 1810, another house was added to the property, in the Federal style. Because of Adams' social standing, several correspondents described parties in the house.Samuel Mordecai, Richmond in Bygone Days (Richmond, 1860) pp. 138-140 Adams served as senior warden of St. John's Episcopal Church nearby, represented Henrico County in the House of Burgesses (before independence) and the House of Delegates and Senate afterward, and was one of the 12 founding members of Richmond's Common Council and its sixth mayor. By 1844, the court clerk, Palmer, owned the house, which he sold in 1859 to William Taylor. Taylor transformed the house into an Italianate-style brick and stucco mansion.127-0192 St. John's Church Historic District 1991 Final Nomination Amendment, section 7 page 2 The building grew from six to 20 rooms, as well as added another storey. Richard A. Wilkins, a Virginian who had returned from operating a sugar plantation in Louisiana to educate his children, bought the property in 1860 for $20,000. His wife operated a hospital for recovering soldiers in the mansion during the Civil War, and their son watched battles from the cupola. After the Confederate capital fell in 1865, a Union general used it as his headquarters, and relegated the Taylors to the upper floor. They sold it to the Catholic bishop and moved to Tennessee.Wilkins, Benjamin Harrison, War Boy: A True Story of the Civil War and Re-Construction Days (Tennessee, 1938) at http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/008997812 After the war ended, Catholic Bishop John McGill requested nuns from the Archdiocese of Baltimore, to pray for the devastated city as well as to educate girls. The first order to respond was the Sisters of the Visitation, whose superior, Mother Mary Baptista, was a native of Norfolk, Virginia and sister of Father Alexander Hitzelberger (who joined the Jesuits after serving in Norfolk and Petersburg). Although the Sisters of the Visitation were generally a contemplative order in Europe, for more than sixty years they ran an elite boarding and day school on this site, which they named Monte Maria. Other nuns who responded (and opened schools at different locations within Richmond) included the Daughters of Charity (whose school was at St. Patrick's on the opposite side of the hill/St. John's Church), and Benedictine nuns from Pennsylvania who taught at St. Mary's parochial school (also briefly staffed by the School Sisters of Notre Dame). In 1895, following a donation from Thomas Fortune Ryan, the Visitation order built a Romanesque revival style brick chapel and service building to the east of the original Taylor House. In 1900 they enclosed the buildings and gardens with a high brick wall. In 1923 a three-story brick dormitory with Colonial Revival details was built between the house and chapel.NRHP Amendment at Section 7 page 2. Some smaller buildings on the property, and the old Adams mansion, were demolished circa 1929. A bequest from the Mother Superior in 1927 allowed the Visitation nuns to close the school and concentrate on their contemplative activities, so the sisters renovated the dormitories into individual cells. The nuns also produced the sacramental bread for local parishes, and even the Atlantic Fleet during the Second World War. In 1952 a print shop was added in a cinder block wing that replaced a small porch on the building's west side.Benjamin Campbell, A brief history of Richmond Hill (Richmond, 2007) In 1955 they removed the cupola, fearing a lightning strike similar to that at Trinity United Methodist Church. Although the order renovated the chapel consistent with the reforms of the Second Vatican Council, the nuns were aging and the order needed to further consolidate its properties. In 1985, the sisters decided the sell the property and build a monastery in rural Rockville, Hanover County. Current use The historic district designation interfered with some developers' plans, and many in the community wanted to preserve both the historic structure and its spiritual mission. In February, 1986, a non-profit corporation was formed by an ecumenical group which included members of 15 denominations. It purchased the Monte Maria property the following November following a strange series of coincidences. Renovated and renamed Richmond Hill, the residential community and conference center continues the practice of daily prayers for Richmond and the surrounding metropolitan area, and works for personal spiritual development and interracial harmony. The debt to purchase the property was paid off in 2012.

Fasching-Varner has published articles, books, and book chapters, and has contributed to academic discourse through presentations at academic conferences at international, national, and local contexts. Early life Fasching-Varner grew up in Rochester, New York, and attended public schools from K‚Äì8.Fasching-Varner, K.J. (2006). \\"Pedagogy of respect: The inter-generational influence of Black women‚Äôs pedagogy of respect\\". Midwest American Educational Research Journal, 19(2), 28‚Äì35. Fasching-Varner had the experience of being taught in K‚Äì8 by a significant number of Black female educators, whose teaching style and activism made a significant impact on his own teaching. Fasching-Varner was influenced significantly by negative community narratives about the value of urban inner- city students, of which he was one, and has published about the disconnect between teacher identities and student identities and the contribution of negative perspectives to community narratives about students from underrepresented groups.Fasching-Varner, K.J., Dodo-Seriki, V.C. (2012). Moving beyond seeing with our eyes wide shut: A response to ‚ÄúThere is no culturally responsive teaching spoken here.‚Äù Democracy and Education, 20(1), 1‚Äì6. Free and reduced pedagogy concept Fasching-Varner, along with colleague Vanessa Dodo-Seriki, has advanced a critique of under-engaged teaching called \\"free and reduced pedagogy\\". Fasching-Varner and Dodo-Seriki discuss free and reduced pedagogy as a non-people first style of teaching that reduces, through a teacher's discourse, the value of the student and the teacher's ability to teach the student based on non-controllable demographics. In his own work,Fasching-Varner, K. J. (2013). Working through whiteness: Examining white racial identity and profession with pre-service teachers. Lanham, MD: Lexington Press. Fasching-Vanrer has found that teachers in high- needs areas tend to look across areas of difference as a means of dismissing a student's potential, and has often found students being referred to as \\"free and reduced lunch students\\", helping in coining the term \\"free and reduced pedagogy\\".

Working through whiteness: Examining white racial identity and profession with pre-service teachers. Lanham, MD: Lexington Press. attempts to, in part, understand how teacher narratives reveal preventative gaps from achieving culturally relevant pedagogy. Critical race theory and white racial identity Fasching-Varner has an active research agenda centered in critical race theory. While studying with theorist Adrienne Dixson at The Ohio State University, Fasching-Varner developed an interest in critical race theory with an emphasis and focus on the manifestation of white racial identity in the narratives of pre-service teachers. Fasching-Varner's work links considerations of critical race theory and culturally responsive pedagogy, with an emphasis on the property value of whiteness. Fasching-Varner has proposed a non-developmental model for racial identity which provides a radically different approach from that proposed by Janet Helms, long considered the authority in white racial identity development. Fasching- Varner's work has received praise from several leading authorities in the fields of multiculturalism, whiteness studies, and culturally relevant teaching. Kevin Kumashiro, president of the National Association of Multicultural Educators, suggests that Fasching-Varner has written an \\"important new book\\" in this field. Elaine Richardson, professor of language and literacy at The Ohio State University, encourages people to \\"read this book. [to] be inspired and informed\\". A leading authority in culturally responsive teaching, Geneva Gay says of Fasching-Varner's work that \\"This is a must read for White prospective and practicing teachers, as well as teacher educators. Finally, Tim Wise, author of White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son, says of Fasching-Varner's work that \\"All pre-service teachers should read it, as should anyone who cares about the creation of educational equity in the United States\\". School-to-prison and neoliberal critique Around 2014 Fasching-Varner extended his work to include economic analysis of schools, education, and the prison industrial complexes.ubwp.buffalo.edu Fasching-Varner has extended ideas from critical race theory, particularly racial realism, to work toward explaining the persistent nexus between schools and prisons, articulating that the connection is a natural consequence of neo-liberal economic orientations and policies in the United States.

The show is produced by 79th & York Entertainment and the re-launched Orion Television, and is distributed by MGM Domestic Television Distribution. Paternity Court is executive produced by David Armour. According to John Bryan, president of MGM Domestic Television Distribution, the series is MGM's first first-run syndication series to come to the market in years (MGM generally syndicates past scripted output, along with past distribution of First Business). Reports of the series first emerged in December 2012. As early as December 2012, the court show was already sold in 75% of the country. Stations acquired the show on an all-barter basis with 3¬Ω minutes of local and 3¬Ω minutes of national advertising time in every episode. By August 2013, the show was sold in 92% of the country. Paternity Court premiered on Monday, September 23, 2013. The court show's first day of taping was on June 13, 2013. On January 28, 2014, Paternity Court was renewed for a second season, which added Lake's name directly to the title as Lauren Lake's Paternity Court. Production also moved from Los Angeles to the Georgia Public Broadcasting studios in Atlanta previously utilized by Swift Justice with Nancy Grace in the 2010‚Äì11 season; as with many Atlanta-based productions it also receives tax credits from the Georgia Film Office for producing the show in Georgia, and the GFO has an end credit for their support. In 2019, the show received its first Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Legal/Courtroom Program. Conception An article in Broadcasting & Cable talking about the conception of the show listed the paternity test-focused episodes of the daytime talk show Maury as a direct inspiration for Paternity Court, as Bryan said in the article that the high ratings for Maury among women 25-54 and the popularity of the court show genre made fusing the two concepts possible. Weigel Broadcasting president Neal Sabin, whose station group was among the first to take the program, thought it was a natural fit for the court show- heavy lineup on his stations, saying it was 'a little bit Maury and a little bit court-y'. Producers of the series have argued at the same time that Paternity Court and Maury do contrast, as Paternity Court does not focus on the narrative of Maury in building tabloid drama solely from the \\"who's your daddy?\\" question posed by paternity tests and the issues of multiple partners possibly being so with only bare follow-ups by that show's staff, but instead uses the tests on their show to build long-term relationships in a healthy manner once those results are revealed. As reported in late 2012, court programming is the second highest-rated genre on daytime television. Bryan has stated the goal of Paternity Court is to reinvigorate the court show genre. Format Paternity Court is a half-hour hybrid of a talk show using the court show plaintiff/defendant format. Lake talks to the show's litigants and decides cases based upon the results of DNA tests. While the show's title is Paternity Court, it also looks into other situations using DNA verification, such as probate disputes over wills, which are litigated under a binding arbitration arrangement. In late January 2013, creator David Armour revealed several details of the MGM conflict-resolution strip with Lauren Lake: ::‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not talking about someone who broke another person‚Äôs sunglasses; these are life-altering decisions. There is a beginning, middle and end to each story. But then there‚Äôs what happens after the paternity test results. We don‚Äôt take any of this lightly. There is a responsible side to the show where we help families get on the right path.‚Äù ::The program \\"plans to bring something ... interesting but with a truly positive resolution.‚Äù ::Most episodes end with Lake revealing the results of a paternity test, but this doesn't happen in every episode. The show covers a wide range of cases. ::Armour has stated that, \\"We want to dig into these stories much deeper than any other court show does. We‚Äôre dealing with substantial issues. On this show, we‚Äôre dealing with resolutions about how families can move forward now that they have [paternity test] results.‚Äù Unlike most present-day court shows which typically have two cases in each episode, Paternity Court only focuses on one case per episode, though a second case can make an uncommon appearance. Lake takes time before and after the results to speak with her litigants. Location Original plans for Paternity Court were to film the series from a real-life courtroom, though this later changed to a traditional studio setting. The first season of the show was taped from Sunset Bronson Studios in Los Angeles, next to the Judge Judy set, leasing over the space previously used for Big Ticket Television's Judge Joe Brown until its 2013 cancellation. Production moved to Atlanta beginning with season 2 as detailed above. Spin- offs Paternity Court has launched two spin-offs: Couples Court, which is hosted by Keith and Dana Cutler and follows a similar approach of using evidence and testing to prove or disprove infidelity; and Personal Injury Court, which is hosted by Gino Brogdon and presides over personal injury cases.https://tvnewscheck.com/article/238119/personal-injury-court-to- premiere-sept-16/ In July 2020, the show launched a podcast https://www.audioup.com/shows/paternitycourt featuring highlights of its \\"most popular, shocking, and provocative cases\\" in conjunction with Audio Up.http://www.insideradio.com/podcastnewsdaily/lauren-lake-brings-tv-s- paternity-court-to- podcasting/article_13eff6d4-cd04-11ea-89d8-4b8e4818ae99.html References  External links  * * Category:2010s American reality television series Category:2013 American television series debuts Category:First-run syndicated television programs in the United States Category:English-language television shows Category:Television series by MGM Television Category:American television talk shows Category:Court shows Category:Paternity in the United States ","title":"Lauren Lake's Paternity Court"},{"id":"37990052","text":"ENAV S.p.A. is an Italian company owned by the Ministry of Economy and Finances and managed by the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport, through ENAC, the Italian Civil Aviation Authority.

Before the Civil War  Built in 1848 by Rogers, Ketchum & Grosvenor in Paterson, New Jersey, the Yonah was the third 4-4-0 locomotive purchased by the Western and Atlantic Railroad. Very little is known about the engine's service life, but it is assumed to have served as a construction train as the railroad was being built from Atlanta, Georgia to Chattanooga, Tennessee, and was believed to have been the first engine to arrive in the latter city. The engine was likely used for both freight and passenger service for the Western and Atlantic. The Yonah was an example of an early 4-4-0 design, featuring a Haycock firebox design and having its pilot wheels closely spaced with the cylinder placed above at an angle. Thus, the engine was likely relegated to yard service as early as the late 1850s, as the railroad had acquired larger, more powerful locomotives such as the General and the Texas.  Civil War  During the Civil War, the Western and Atlantic had leased the Yonah to the Cooper Iron Works, which operated a short spur to their foundry from a junction at Etowah, Georgia. On April 12, 1862, The General was commandeered by Northerners led by James J. Andrews at Big Shanty (now Kennesaw, Georgia), and passed the Yonah at Etowah as it traveled north towards Chattanooga. Noticing that the Yonah was under full steam and ready for service, the group of raiders aboard the General suggested destroying the engine. However, Andrews declined as he felt doing so would have little impact on the railroad and might draw attention to the raiders and their intentions. Thus, Andrews and his train passed through Etowah without stopping and continued north.

The reason for the denial, cited in the official documents, is: the immorality of its characters and the subject, and the numerous dirty scenes considered offensive to decency. Two years later, in 1971, the Movie Reviewing Commission, approved the projection of the movie, but rated it as VM18: not suitable for children under 18. In addition, the Committee imposed the removal of the following scenes: 1) the scene of the ritual of the Virgin (trial); 2) the scene in which Inga masturbates; 3) the scene in which Inga and the young man see each other for the third time and are in bed.

The railroad was built slowly in preparation for anticipated pulpwood harvesting, but onset of the Great Depression caused the railroad to be dismantled when harvesting plans were delayed. History Spruce forests of the Maine North Woods were a source of pulpwood through the 20th century. Trees were bucked into lengths and loaded onto sleds towed by draft animals or log haulers to the nearest river or lake. Log drives would float the pulpwood logs to a downstream paper mill when the snow and ice melted. Pulpwood growing in the upper Saint John River drainage was destined for Great Northern Paper Company's Millinocket mill on the West Branch Penobscot River. The problem was getting the pulpwood out of the north-flowing Saint John River into the east- flowing Penobscot River. An rail route from Fifth Saint John Pond to the Penobscot River at Seboomook Lake was surveyed in 1910 after Great Northern Paper Company acquired forest lands along the Baker Branch Saint John River. Construction delayed by World War I began in the summer of 1919. of right of way were cleared that year and 60,000 logs were cut for railroad ties and telephone poles. Bridges were built in 1920 and two wharves were completed on Seboomook Lake for steamboats bringing supplies to the railroad. The first was at the railroad's South Terminal and the other was at the northern end of the ancient northwest carry from Moosehead Lake. A sawmill was built at South terminal that winter; and an engine house, offices, cook shacks, and living quarters for a 300-man construction crew were erected in the spring of 1921. The old gauge Carry Pond and Carry Brook Railroad over northwest carry was rebuilt in to transfer railway equipment from Coburn Steamboat Company barges on Moosehead Lake to the Seboomook Lake barge Pittston launched on June 7, 1921. Barges initially delivered a narrow gauge work train of flatcars and dump cars. It was followed by a steam shovel, teams of horses, and a standard gauge Climax locomotive with fifteen railroad cars to carry of pulpwood each.Gove, William G. The Railroad that went Nowhere in Down East magazine The Climax locomotive had been built in 1910 for the Conway Company of Conway, New Hampshire, and was delivered to Moosehead Lake by the Maine Central Railroad in July. New Baldwin 2-6-2 #1 arrived at Moosehead Lake about the same time. Climax #2 arrived at South Terminal on July 6, but Baldwin #1 was returned to the manufacturer. of track were laid before construction was halted in the autumn of 1922. Telephone line was strung in 1923, but the Climax rested in the engine house until construction resumed in 1926. Construction was again halted when rails reached Fourth Saint John Pond as attention shifted to pulpwood delivery over the Eagle Lake and West Branch Railroad. No pulpwood trains ever ran to Seboomook Lake. The railroad was ultimately used by a Ford truck with flanged wheels to deliver supplies from the lake to logging camps through World War II, and rails were removed converting the right of way to a truck road after the war.

Many topological and geometric properties of the classical 2-torus have algebraic analogues for the noncommutative tori, and as such they are fundamental examples of a noncommutative space in the sense of Alain Connes.  Definition  For any real number Œ∏, the noncommutative torus AŒ∏ is the C*-subalgebra of B(L2(S1)), the algebra of bounded linear operators of square-integrable functions on the unit circle S1 of C, generated by the unitary elements U and V, where U(f)(z)=zf(z) and V(f)(z)=f(e‚àí2œÄ iŒ∏z). A quick calculation shows that VU = e‚àí2œÄiŒ∏UV.  Alternative characterizations  * Universal property: AŒ∏ can be defined (up to isomorphism) as the universal C*-algebra generated by two unitary elements U and V satisfying the relation VU = e2œÄiŒ∏UV. This definition extends to the case when Œ∏ is rational. In particular when Œ∏ = 0, AŒ∏ is isomorphic to continuous functions on the 2-torus by the Gelfand transform. * Irrational rotation algebra: Let the infinite cyclic group Z act on the circle S1 by the rotation action by angle 2iŒ∏. This induces an action of Z by automorphisms on the algebra of continuous functions C(S1). The resulting C*-crossed product C(S1) ‚ãä Z is isomorphic to AŒ∏. The generating unitaries are the generator of the group Z and the identity function on the circle z : S1 ‚Üí C. * Twisted group algebra: The function œÉ : Z2 √ó Z2 ‚Üí C; œÉ((m,n), (p,q)) = e2œÄinpŒ∏ is a group 2-cocycle on Z2, and the corresponding twisted group algebra C*(Z2; œÉ) is isomorphic to AŒ∏. Properties * Every irrational rotation algebra AŒ∏ is simple, that is, it does not contain any proper closed two-sided ideals other than \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\} and itself. * Every irrational rotation algebra has a unique tracial state. * The irrational rotation algebras are nuclear.  Classification and K-theory  The K-theory of AŒ∏ is Z2 in both even dimension and odd dimension, and so does not distinguish the irrational rotation algebras. But as an ordered group, K0 ‚âÉ Z + Œ∏Z. Therefore, two noncommutative tori AŒ∏ and AŒ∑ are isomorphic if and only if either Œ∏ + Œ∑ or Œ∏ ‚àí Œ∑ is an integer. Two irrational rotation algebras AŒ∏ and AŒ∑ are strongly Morita equivalent if and only if Œ∏ and Œ∑ are in the same orbit of the action of SL(2, Z) on R by fractional linear transformations. In particular, the noncommutative tori with Œ∏ rational are Morita equivalent to the classical torus. On the other hand, the noncommutative tori with Œ∏ irrational are simple C*-algebras.

He was appointed by President Rodrigo Duterte as the new Secretary of National Commission on Muslim Filipinos with a term of two years on 9 July 2018, replacing former secretary Yasmin Busran Lao. Education and work He studied at the Jamiatul Philippine al-Islamia (Islamic University of the Philippines) in Marawi City, where he was a consistent valedictorian in his elementary and high school years in 1956‚Äì1966. He finished his Liberal Arts degree in 1971 and Law in 1976 at the San Beda College as a consistent college scholar. He passed the Philippine bar examinations on the same year with a weighted average of 85.6%. He immediately went to law practice with the prestigious Siguion-Reyna, Montecillo & Ongsiako law offices in Makati City until 1984, where he became a legal counsel of both local and multi-national companies in the Philippines such as Bank of America, Goodyear, Caltex, Sumitomo, Dole Philippines, San Miguel Corp., PLDT, Philippine Airlines, and Equitable PCI Bank (now BDO). Political career As an opposition candidate against the ruling Kilusang Bagong Lipunan (KBL), Pangarungan was elected Assemblyman of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) from 1979 to 1982. He was the vice president of the PDP‚ÄìLaban Party since 1984. After the EDSA revolution in 1986, Pangarungan was appointed acting governor of Lanao del Sur, replacing governor Mohamad Ali Dimaporo, a powerful ally of then President Ferdinand Marcos during the martial law regime. A challenge to his administration was the kidnapping of 12 Carmelite nuns from their Marawi hilltop convent by lawless group of men. From the Vatican, Pope John Paul II appealed to their captors to release the nuns who were later brought to Lumbayanague across south of Lake Lanao. After two weeks of continued search, Pangarungan led government security forces and encircled the kidnappers' holdout. Under heavy pressure, the outnumbered kidnappers were forced to release all the nuns, safe and unharmed. Abolishing of 2,000 ghost barangays Pangarungan was later appointed as undersecretary of Department of Interior and Local Government by President Corazon Aquino. He was tasked as chairman of the inter-agency committee that investigated the ghost barangays in the Muslim provinces. After 6 months of ocular investigations and upon his recommendations, President Aquino signed an executive order abolishing some 2,000 ghost barangays in the two Lanao provinces, saving the government billions of pesos in regular allotments to the non-existent or uninhabited villages. As undersecretary, he also helped craft an executive order granting regular salaries and allowances to barangay (village) officials in the country. Governor In the 1988 elections, he was elected governor of Lanao del Sur, beating the political dynasties in the province. As governor, he built the 4-hectare provincial capitol complex overlooking the scenic Lake Lanao, the provincial library, People's Park and commissioned other infrastructure projects. He also concreted 110 kilometers of two major road networks: the Lake Lanao circumferential road and the Marawi-Malabang Road. At that time, the internal revenue allotment (IRA) of the provincial government was a meager P850,000 a month compared to the P160 million monthly at 2017 figures. During Pangarungan's watch, the province was drug-free because of his staunch campaign against illegal drugs trade. Under his governorship, Lanao del Sur and its capital was much peaceful, with no recorded firefights or skirmishes between government and rebel forces. He negotiated the surrender of thousands of MNLF and MILF rebels. For his unprecedented achievements, Pangarungan was awarded thrice as one of the \\"Most Outstanding Governors of the Philippines\\" in three consecutive years: 1989, 1990 and 1991. Peacemaker Pangarungan was also a member of the Philippine delegation at the World Muslim Congress in Karachi, Pakistan in 1983, where he sponsored the adoption of the 'Karachi Declaration for Peace & Unity' to revive the long stalled peace talks between the Marcos government and the rebel MNLF and BMLO forces. The delegation included Senators Acmad Domocao Alonto, Salipada Pendatun, speakers Uttoh Ututalum and Abulkhayr Alonto, Court of Appeals justice Mama Busran and Princess Tarhata Lucman. In 1987, President Cory Aquino sent Senators Aquilino Pimentel Jr., Agapito Butz Aquino, Norberto Gonzales and Pangarungan to the Organization of Islamic Conference in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia to revive the peace talks with the MNLF- Nur Misuari faction. This led to the signing of the Jeddah Accord of 1987. Nur Misuari ended his exile and returned to the Philippines to eventually sign the 1996 Final Peace Accord with the government. Mindanao power crisis In 2007, he became President of the Agus 3 Hydropower Corporation; and later in 2013 as chairman/CEO of the Maranao Energy Corp.(MENCO) that won the government bid on the Agus 3 hydropower project (240 Megawatts) in 2015. Pangarungan pursued the Agus 3 project to help address the crippling power outages in Mindanao in 2010 to 2015. Enthronement as a sultan He was enthroned Sultan of the Sultanate of Madaya, Marawi City on July 5, 2009, attended by 12,000 dignitaries and guests. Secretary, National Commission on Muslim Filipinos Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea (rightmost) during the 2019 Eid al-Fitr Celebration. On July 9, 2018, President Rodrigo Duterte appointed Pangarungan as secretary with cabinet rank and chairman, National Commission on Muslim Filipinos (NCMF). Under its charter, Republic Act 9997, the commission is tasked to uplift the socio-economic and cultural lives of the approximately 8 million Muslims in the Philippines. Pangarungan's priority agenda was to reform the NCMF long dogged by corruption, ensure a comfortable and affordable annual Hajj (Pilgrimage) to Makkah, Saudi Arabia for thousands of Filipino pilgrims, and led a joint nationwide project with the United Nation Development Program (UNDP) and the Japanese Government in strengthening national and local resilience against violent extremism. Pangarungan launched the project at the Mindanao State University in Marawi City on January 23, 2019 in time with the twin explosions in a cathedral in Jolo,Sulu that killed twenty parishioners and 111 wounded. Three days later, a grenade explosion rocked a mosque in Zamboanga City that killed 2 imams and wounding 4 others. These violent incidents were widely condemned by Muslim and Christian leaders in the country. Personal life, family and ancestry He is married to Princess Johayra Diamond Ali Pacasum Pangarungan, the Bailabi a Gaus sa Ranao and former assemblywoman of ARMM. Pangarungan was born in Marawi City on September 23, 1950, to Datu Abdulrahman Diambangan Balt of the Sultanate of Bayang, and the late Bae Jameela Asum Pangarungan Amai Manabilang of the Sultanate of Lanao and the Sultanate of Madaya. Pangarungan came from a line of great ancestors. His paternal great-grandfather Sultan Pandapatan of Bayang led Maranaw resistance against the American forces stationed in Malabang, Lanao del Sur, under Colonel Frank Baldwin with 600 soldiers composed of the 27th Infantry, 15th Cavalry under the command of Captain Pershing and 25th Battery of Fields. Colonel Baldwin initiated the attack of Bayang in retaliation to the murder of two soldiers in Malabang for the snatching of the soldiers' Krag rifles. The Battle of Padang Karbala in Bayang took place in Cotta Pandapatan on May 2, 1902, conceded to be the fiercest battle ever fought by the superior American forces in the Philippines. This historic battle which left Bayang as the \\"land of the widows and orphans\\" claimed the lives of 300 Maranaw fighters including Sultan Pandapatan and death of 11 American soldiers that included Lt. Thomas Vicars and wounding severely 40 other soldiers. Pershing was never present in the battlefield of Cotta Pandapatan, he was busy convincing, thru diplomacy and negotiations, other sultans and Datus not to support and go with Sultan Pandapatan, who openly and in writing, declared resistance to the American forces. Had it not for Pershing's peaceful efforts, The Battle of Bayang could have escalated to a war between all the Maranaws against the Americans. President Roosevelt furiously disliked the attack of Baldwin on Bayang and prompted Major General Adna Chaffe, US Philippine Dapartment commander, to designate Capt Pershing as new commander of 27th infantry Regiment, 15th Cavalry, and 25th Battery, whose new camp named \\"Camp Vicars\\" was establiblished near Binidayan and Bayang two days after the Battle of Bayang. Pershing's diplomatic and military skills before and after his Mindanao tour of duty prompted President Roosevelt to promote Pershing to colonel, but seniority in US Army prevailed and only the ranks of Generals are subject to presidential control, Roosevelt assigned Pershing in Tokyo as Military Attache in 1905, and of the same year, Roosevelt convinced the US Congress and promoted Pershing to Brigadier General. Sultan Saidamen Pangarungan's maternal great grandfather is Datu Amai Manabilang Didato who led Muslim leaders signed the \\"1935 Dansalan Declaration\\" urging the US Congress for the exclusion of Muslim lands in Mindanao in the grant of Philippine independence, so that at a later transition period the United States can grant a separate independence for Mindanao under Muslim rule. Datu Amai Manabilang then envisioned the U.S. granting a separate Muslim homeland in Mindanao and avoid a separatist war in Mindanao in the future as what happened four decades later. The Moro insurgency started by the MNLF in Marawi city in 1971 has claimed some 120,000 lives, mostly Muslims and more than 10,000 government troops. It displaced some 500,000 Muslim Filipinos as refugees to Sabah, Malaysia. As an alternative to secession, Pangarungan however advocated \\"unity in diversity\\" thru a substantive and meaningful autonomy to Muslim Mindanao. Pangarungan was a governor of Lanao del Sur when the province voted to join the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) during the 1989 plebiscite on the ARMM Organic Act 14.

The rachis and main leaf venation, which are prominently raised below, are armed with recurved spines on both leaf surfaces. The petioles and stems are likewise armed to discourage browsers. The shoots and leaves are deciduous, dying away during harsh highveld winters, when the plant survives as an extensive woody, tuberous rootstock. The upright inflorescences appear in summer, with the leaves, from October to January. The drooping scarlet, or rarely white flowers, are capped by a red calyxes. Their fruit are smooth black pods when mature, each containing a few large (1.0 to 1.7 cm long) seeds. These are hard and orange-red in colour.

Here the common English spelling of Swami Vivekananda's nickname has been used. or Bilay (Bengali: ‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶≤‡ßá) is a 2012 Bengali drama created by Bengali theatre group Lokkrishti, This is a dramatisation of the life and works of Swami Vivekananda. Debshankar Haldar played the lead role. Phalguni Chattopadhyay directed this drama and Ujjwal Chattopadhyay was the playwright. The drama received an appreciative critical response, with one review in Bengali newspaper Anandabazar Patrika calling it a remarkable step in Bengali theatre (though they also criticized the choreography, music, characters and some of the acting).  Synopsis  Biley attempts to cover the whole life of Swami Vivekananda. In order to cover eventful life of Vivekananda in a narrative form within the two-hour span of the drama, the production employed the technique of flashbacks during a conversation between Vivekananda as an adult, and Vivekananda as a child. Different events from his life starting from childhood days to meeting with the mystic saint Ramakrishna at Dakshineswar, Vivekananda's travel to the West, meeting with Sister Nivedita, and his works in India have been captured in flashback, thereby building his journey from being Narendranath to Vivekananda in bits and pieces. In this drama the director has tried to capture the humanly aspects of Vivekananda. Some unpleasant questions are asked and bitter issues raised throughout the drama. Young Narndranath says directly to Ramakrishna that he had used his wife Sarada Devi, sacrificing her womanhood for the sake of divine worship. Vivekananda confesses that even a Sannyasi feels frustrated and depressed, feels sorrow and sheds tears. Vivekananda gets irritated multiple times by the questions of Nivedita, and faces conflicts between religion and politics.  Making  The Bengali drama was an initiative taken by Lokkrishti to commemorate 150th birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda. The play was written by Ujjwal Chattopadhyay. It took him one year to finish the screenplay.  Credits   Cast  * Debshankar Haldar as Biley (Narendranath Datta/Vivekananda) * Guddu as child Narendranath * Phalguni Chattopadhyay as Ramakrishna * Rumki Chattopadhyay as Sarada Devi * Monalisa as Sister Nivedita  Production  * Theatre group: Lokkrishti * Director: Phalguni Chattopadhyay * Playwright: Ujjwal Chattopadhyay * Stage decoration: Soumik and Piyali * Choreographer: Monalisa * Light: Sudip Sanyal * Background music: Arup Ratan  Reception  In the Bengali newspaper Anandabazar Patrika's review the drama has been described as a remarkable step in Bengali theatre. Debshankar's acting as Narendranath Datta has been appreciated. Phalguni Chattopadhyay as Ramakrishna applauded too. Rumki Chattopadhyay's acting as Sarada Devi has been little criticized for non- seriousness and acting of Monalisa as Sister Nivedita has been remarked as unnatural. Guddu as you child Vivekananda has been highly applauded. The choreography of the play has been remarked as improper and irrelevant for the play. The music has sometimes slowed down the pace of the drama and it has also been remarked that the characters Mahendralal Sarkar and Girish Chandra Ghosh could not be portrayed properly.

It was described by Colin Ernest Ridsdale in 1975. The genus contains only one species, viz. Breonadia salicina, which is found in tropical and southern Africa from Mali and Benin east to Ethiopia, south to South Africa, as well as Yemen, Saudi Arabia and Madagascar. Breonadia salicina (Matumi, , , , ) is a protected tree in South Africa. Characteristics Breonadia salicina is a medium to large evergreen tree. The leaves occur alternately or in whorls of 3 to 5. The leaf shape is generally lanceolate and the leaf margin is entire. They are leathery to the touch and usually a dark green with yellow on the midrib, which is slightly raised. The fruit is a capsule and they cluster in small spheres. The trees are monoecious with flowers that are small and yellow in color. The tree is generally found in subtropical to tropical climates, mainly in small populations in South Africa to Saudi Arabia and even Madagascar. It can be found in areas up to 2000 meters above sea level. They usually live on river banks or in the waters of a stream. This species is often used in traditional medicine. Many times the whole plant can be used in treating diseases like arthritis and illnesses like diarrhea. In one experiment, leaf extracts of Breonadia salicina helped prevent the growth of bacteria that cause food poisoning. Genetic Diversity In a population of Breonadia salicina in Saudi Arabia, genetic diversity was low within individuals of a single population, but was high between individuals from other populations. This means that the individual small populations of Breonadia salicina are very different from one another, but there is very little genetic diversity inside of the small populations. The populations are fairly far apart (the species is endangered) which would account for the high diversity rate between populations. The populations are also small in size and would be noticeably affected by genetic drift. Tropical trees also must deal with environmental factors such as deforestation and logging. B. salicina has been used as a source of wood used to build houses and objects. Physical characteristics, such as diameter and density of xylem vessels, is due to the plant‚Äôs genetic makeup, but also many environmental factors as well (for this experiment it was rainfall). Medicinal Uses Breonadia salicina is used in traditional African medicine. Mainly people use the bark to fight diarrhea and other stomach/digestive tract problems but also use other parts of the plant for different uses. The bark of B. salicina has been found to be rich in tannins. Tannins are polyphenols that have been found to help with reducing growth of E. coli in digestive tracts. Leaf extracts of B. salicina have also been found to reduce activity of both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. It is believed that these same anti-bacterial properties of B. salicina can be used for the preservation of foods. Possible antifungal compounds have also been isolated in B. salicina. The same antifungal compounds in B. salicina have been found to show activity in protecting oranges from infections.

As the Civil War was in progress, they were able to pose as Confederate Partisan Rangers, and their original mission was to rid the area of (anti-slavery) Republicans. But when it became clear that the Confederate cause was lost, they turned to outlawry, plundering and killing without mercy. The two leaders were John Mason, an alleged murderer, and Tom McCauley, a California Gold Rush criminal using the alias Jim Henry. The gang may have numbered up to sixteen at its peak. McCauley was shot dead in September 1865 by the San Bernardino County Sheriff Benjamin Franklin Mathews's posse, and Mason killed in April 1866 by a miner, Ben Mayfield, whom he had tried to kidnap.  Mason and Henry as Partisan Rangers  In early 1864, a dedicated southern sympathizer from Tennessee, secessionist Judge George Gordon Belt, a rancher and former alcalde in Stockton, used his ranch on the Merced River to organize a group of partisan rangers. They would be led by two southerners John Mason and \\"Jim Henry\\" and sent out to recruit more men and pillage the property of Union men in the countryside. Unfortunately Judge Belt had chosen his men poorly. Both men had unsavory pasts. Mason was a southern-born former stage hostler who had reportedly killed several men. William B. Secrest, California Badmen: Mean Men with Guns, Word Dancer Press, Sanger, California, 2007. pg. 143-147 Jim Henry was a criminal whose real name was Tom McCauley. He and his brother had been robbers within the gold camps and together had murdered a man in Tuolumne County in 1856. He had been sent to prison for ten years and his brother was hanged. A History of Tuolumne County, California, B.F. Alley, San Francisco, 1882. pages 201-249 Murder of Bond by McCauley. After his release from prison McCauley had returned to robbery with a gang along the Fresno River. When several of the gang were captured and lynched by vigilantes, Tom McCauley then fled and reinvented himself as Jim Henry. In the spring of 1864 the gang rode over to Santa Clara County, a center of Copperhead sympathizers, to recruit more members. Unfortunately it was a drought year that depressed the economy, and the increasingly bad war news also discouraged most of their recruits. They returned without success to the San Joaquin Valley. By October 1864, with the Presidential election approaching, Mason and Henry's gang turned into brigands. However, they referred to themselves as Confederate soldiers, and managed to garner support among the local Copperheads. They threatened to kill any \\"black republican\\" they came across.  Mason and Henry become outlaws  On November 10, 1864, the Mason Henry Gang committed their first crimes, three murders, soon after the second election of Abraham Lincoln. These crimes were described in the Stockton Daily Independent, for Monday, 14 November 1864: :: On the evening after the election Mason and McHenry went over to Dutch Charley's, against whom they had a spite, and killed him. From his place they went to Mr. Hawthorne's, knocked at the stable, where 3 hired men were sleeping, and after cowing these men, obtained their pistols, went to the house and murdered Mr. Hawthorn [spelled 2 ways]. They then returned to the stable, telling the men what they had done, and that they intended to kill all the Republicans they could. They took Hawthorn's watch, double-barreled shot-gun, and 2 horses from the stable. From Hawthorn's they proceeded to the house of Mr. Robinson. After obtaining a drink of water they asked Mrs. Robinson where her husband was. She replied that he had not yet come home from the election, but that a wagon was coming up the road and she thought that was him. They set out for the wagon. Mason came up first. He accosted Robinson with - \\"I am told that you said there was not a decent woman in the South. Did you say so?\\" \\"No, I did not,\\" replied Robinson. \\"You are a liar, and I am going to kill you,\\" said Mason. Robinson then jumped for him. Mason snapped his gun, which missed fire, and then fired with the other barrel, breaking his victim's shoulder and arm. Robinson then ran, but was pursued by McHenry, who shot him twice, 1st in the hand and then in the back of the head, killing him. The murderers then told the man who was in the wagon with Robinson that he might go on to the house and tell who killed R., and moreover, what they did it for. Mason also told him that he was the man who had killed two soldiers at Fort Tejon and 1 at Camp Babbitt, and that MASON was not his real name; that he was after Republicans and intended to kill all he could. The murderers were well armed, having each a double-barreled shot-gun and 2 6-shooters. They did not appear to be influenced by motives of plunder, but solely by malice against Republicans. They have both for several months been around Gilroy and on Wednesday last, were seen near South San Juan. It is to be hoped they will not long escape their just deserts. They are of the worst species of the guerrilla, as cruel as Apaches, and as fanatical as crusaders. Stockton Daily Independent Newspaper published in: Stockton, San Joaquin Co., CA; Monday, 14 November, 1864 The same article announced the reward for their arrest and conviction; ::Reward for Mason and McHenry - Governor Low has offered a reward for the arrest and conviction of the 2 secesh murderers, Mason and McHenry, who on the night of election and next day, killed 3 men in cold blood. The circumstances connected with these murders are such as call for the speedy extermination of these 2 wretches. Afterward the gang crossed Pacheco Pass and went to Santa Cruz County. They hid near Corralitos and frequented Watsonville, where the local secessionists sheltered them. Soon after the murders, they held up a stage on the road from Watsonville to Visalia, killing three men and vowing to \\"slay every Republican they would meet.\\" Under the pretense of being Confederate guerrillas, the gang terrorized Monterey County and the nearby counties for the next several months. 1st Battalion of Native Cavalry, California Volunteers, from Parajo Times (Watsonville), November 12, 1864. see note 20. In late January 1865, Company B, 1st Battalion of Native Cavalry, California Volunteers, a unit of Californio lancers arrived from San Francisco at Camp Low in San Juan Bautista. Camp commander Major Michael O'Brien, 6th California Infantry, shortly afterward, received intelligence about the location of the Mason Henry Gang hideout. A detachment of Native cavalrymen under 1st Lieutenant John Lafferty searched for them, but he was unsuccessful. see note 21. Alta California, January 24, 1865; Michael O'Brien to Low, Camp Low, San Juan, February 1, 1865, Box 8, MNG. On February 18, 1865, Captain Herman Noble sent a detachment of Company E, 2nd California Cavalry, under Sergeant Rowley, from Camp Babbitt near Visalia in a long pursuit of men believed to be the Mason Henry Gang. It took them across the deserts of Southern California, south to Sonora, Mexico. The March 15, 1865, issue of The Visalia Delta described the pursuit: : Mason and Henry - The squad of soldiers sent out from Camp Babbitt by Captain Noble under the command of Sergeant Rowley, in pursuit of the above Constitutional Democratic murders of Union men, have returned to camp. They report a very hard skirmish, traveling over 900 miles through a most desolate country; upon several occasions going out two or three days without food for themselves, or forage for their horses. They were several times on their trail, after they left Fort Tej√≥n, and finally tracked them down into Sonora, when they were compelled to give up the chase on account of their horses giving out and their inability to get fresh ones. The fugitives were well supplied with gold, having $3,000 or more in their possession. It is believed by many that they have gone to recruit a guerrilla band, and will return to prey on Union men in the lower part of the State. They could have obtained plenty of recruits nigher home. Doubtless, Visalia would have furnished several birds of prey and a surgeon or two, to bind up their broken bones, and very likely a Chaplain to minister to their bruised souls, and a number of spies, sneaks, and informers. As to good fighting men, they would be scarcer hereabouts. The party were out twenty-five days.Mason and Henry, The Visalia Delta; March 15, 1865; 3:1. In April 1865, the Mason Henry Gang attacked Firebaugh's Ferry. When word of the attack arrived at San Juan Bautista, Captain Jimeno, of the Native Cavalry, in command of Camp Low, again sent out Lieutenant Lafferty with a detachment of five men to intercept the gang hoping to head them off at Panoche Pass on the western side of the Diablo Range. They encountered Mason the next morning. Mason spurred his horse in an attempt to escape, but Lafferty fired a single bullet that both wounded Mason in the hip and wounded his horse. Although the soldiers captured the outlaw's horse, somehow Mason managed to elude them. At six that evening, Lafferty and his troopers returned to Camp Low with the horse. see note 23, Alta California, April 12, 13, 1865.  Breakup of the gang, death of Henry  Although the Civil War was over, the gang was still under pressure in Central California, so they moved into Southern California and split up. In July 1865 Mason and another gang member, Hawkins, pulled guns on Kern River rancher Philo Jewett, who had fed them dinner. The rancher ran, but his cook John Johnson was stabbed and shot to death. Hawkins was later captured and hanged on the testimony of Jewett, but Mason was still at large.George Gilbert Lynch, The Rio Bravo Ranch, Summer 2007 Volume 57, No. 2, Historic Kern Quarterly Henry with his gang first moved to the area of upper Lytle Creek and San Sevaine Flats in the eastern San Gabriel Mountains, rustling and committing robbery and murder. In September of that year, he and his associates were camped out south of San Bernardino and sent John Rogers to town to obtain provisions. While there, Rogers started drinking. Once drunk, he started boasting about his outlaw connections. Locals of Union sympathies took note, and Rogers soon found himself in the company of San Bernardino County Sheriff Benjamin Franklin Mathews and his posse, leading them to the outlaw camp. After traveling about twenty-five miles, they located Henry camped at San Jacinto Canyon. At sunrise on September 14, the posse approached cautiously when Henry was awakened. He roused himself to fire three shots, striking one posse member in the foot. Henry died in a hail of gunfire, sustaining 57 wounds. His corpse was taken back to town, photographed and displayed in the fashion later typical of the Wild West. Rogers was sent to prison for five years.  Death of Mason  John Mason continued his criminal career in Los Angeles County in the vicinity of Fort Tejon and in what is now Kern County with a $500 reward on his head. While Ben Mayfield was riding to Fort Tejon from his mine in Lytle Creek in April 1866, Mason joined him on the ride and later tried to recruit him into his gang. When Mayfield refused, Mason threatened to kill him, and also threatened to take the horse of another man, W. H. Overton, and kill him. That night while the three were in the same house, none went to sleep, but in the early morning Mason lay down on his bed under a blanket, but was awake. Overton stepped out to look after his horse, then Mason tried to shoot Mayfield from his bed. Mason's pistol tangled in his blanket, giving Mayfield the chance to shoot him first. Daily Alta California, Volume 18, Number 6032, 16 September 1866 ‚Äî Los Angeles News. The Case of Mayfield in Los Angeles. The Testimony of Mayfield in Relation to the Killing of Mason. Mason's death was announced in the Stockton Daily Independent, Saturday, 21 April 1866: ::Mason, the Desparado, Killed -- Visalia, April 20 -- Mason, of the distinguished firm of Mason & Henry, was killed a few days since in Tejon cannon[canyon], by some citizens. There appears to be but little doubt that this is the veritable Mason. It seems there were several of his clan together and they all got off except the chief. Newspaper Abstracts, Stockton Daily Independent, Saturday, 21 April 1866 Trials of Benjamin Mayfield  Mayfield for his pains was not rewarded, but was instead accused of murder by friends of Mason and tried for murder in Los Angeles County. The Sacramento Daily Union, 23 June 1866, quoted The Wilmington Journal on the verdict: ::On the evening of June 8th, the jury in the case of Benjamin Ben Mayfield, who murdered the highwayman John Mason, returned a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree. The next day he was sentenced to be hung on August 1st. The counsel of the murderer Intend to carry the case to a higher Court if possible. Sacramento Daily Union, Volume 31, Number 4755, 23 June 1866 ‚Äî News of the Morning. Mayfield's appeal resulted in a second trial on September 15, 1866. The jury again found the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree, and the counsel for the defense asked for a new trial, which was refused by Judge de la Guerra. The prisoner was sentenced to be hanged in August 1867. On application to the Supreme Court a stay of proceedings was granted.Daily Alta California, Volume 18, Number 6032, 16 September 1866 ‚Äî Los Angeles News. The Case of Mayfield in Los Angeles. Eventually Ben Mayfield was exonerated.  Membership  Estimates of the number of gang members ranged from sixteen to as few as four or five. Members came and went. Some disappeared with the continual bad news for the cause in the war. Others probably left when they became disillusioned with the criminal behavior of Mason and Henry that had nothing to do with the war.

Homicide at Kernville - The Visalia 'Delta' gives the following particulars of the killing of Michael O'Neil at Kernville, on Sunday, the 4th instant, by John Tungate, of Clear Creek. O'Neil was badly in liquor when Tungate, with several others, came up from Linn's Valley, where they had attended a ball or dance. When they approached O'Neil said: \\"There comes a set of damn'd guerrillas, and I'll make some of them show blood before I've done with them,\\" or words to that effect. He immediately approached Tungate and accused him of having given Bill Kelsey a pistol to beat Joe Roberts over the head. Tungate denied this, and pronounced O'Neil's informant a \\"liar.\\" O'Neil advanced threateningly with his hand on his derringer - undrawn - when Tungate suddenly shot him in the neck, cutting the jugular vein, and causing almost instant death. Tungate was immediately taken before Justice Wayland, when, strange to say, although the whole transaction occurred in the presence of nearly a dozen persons, no witness was present who saw Tungate shoot, and he was discharged. A Coroner's jury decided that O'Neil came to his death by a pistol shot fired by John Tungate.

Most of Lichutin's novels and novelets are based on the life of real people of the coastal White Sea areas of his native Pomorje region. Biography Vladimir Lichutin was born in the town of Mezen, Arkhangelsk Oblast, into the family of a teacher. His father was killed in the Great Patriotic War and mother alone had to raise four children. In 1960 Lichutin graduated from the local timber-processing industrial school and enrolled into the Leningrad University's faculty of journalism. After the graduation in 1962 he returned to Arkhangelsk to work as a journalist for the local newspaper Pravda Severa. Litchutin debuted with The White Room novelet, published in the No. 8, 1972, issue of Sever magazine. It was followed by Iona and Alexandra (1973), Long Rest (1974) and The Marriages' Time (1975). Among Vladimir Lichutin's best known 1970s works were Soul's Burning (1976) and Winged Seraphima (1978), both praising native Pomors ' traditional values, their ascetic way of life and high moral standards. Lichutin took part in several folklorist expeditions which provided him with rich linguistic material he has since then incorporated into his prose. In 1975, after graduating the Higher literary Courses at the Soviet Union of Writers he settled in Moscow, but continued to visit his native region regularly. His 1985 novel Wanderers (sequel to Long Rest) told the story of a group of young members of the Old Believers' sect of the early 19th century. His next one, Lyubostai (1987), criticized what he saw as contemporary Soviet intelligentsia's lack of 'moral firmness' and examined the spiritual crisis of the Russian people of the second half of the 20th century. Vladimir Lichutin's epic Raskol (1990-1996) is rated as his outstanding novel. Years later it brought him first the prestigious Yasnaya Polyana Award (2009), then The Russian Government's State Prize (2011). The 2000 book of essays called Soul Inexplicable (subtitled: \\"Thinking of Russian People\\") was praised for its colourful, highly stylized 'skaz' type of language. Two of Litchutin's later novels, The Paradise Fugitives (2005) and The River of Love (2010) brought him The Major Russian Literary Prize of the Writers' Union (2006) and the Bunin's Prize (2011), respectively.

Early life Evans was born on January 5, 1895 in Saugus. He attended Boston University and worked as a journalist before entering politics. He served as a field artillery officer in France during World War I. Massachusetts House of Representatives From 1920 to 1924, Evans represented the 13th Essex District in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. First elected at the age of 21, he was the youngest person ever elected to the Massachusetts General Court. In 1924, he was a candidate for State Senate in the Seventh Middlesex District, but lost in the Republican primary to Charles P. Howard. In 1925, he was elected to the Saugus Board of Selectmen. During his tenure on the board, Evans and fellow selectman C. F. Nelson Pratt paid out of pocket for repairs to a bridge frequently used by Saugus residents that the town could not pay to fix because it was on private property. He also led an effort to make the Board of Selectmen an unpaid board. Saugus public schools Principal From 1922 to 1930, Evans was submaster of Saugus High School. On August 29, 1930 he was promoted to principal following the departure of Robert R. Webber. As principal, Evans pushed for the overcrowded High School to be expanded. Superintendent In 1934, he was appointed School Superintendent. In October 1935, Evans expelled six Jehovah's Witness students who refused to salute the flag. In 1937, the Saugus Public School System became embroiled in a controversy after English teacher and dramatic coach Isabelle Hallin was not reappointed by the school committee amid rumors that she had served cocktails to students during a drama club rehearsal at her home. The three members of the School Committee who voted against keeping Hallin insisted that their actions were based on reports from Evans on her abilities as a teacher and not the unproven rumors. Evans publicly recommend giving her tenure, but the school committee refuse to reinstate her. Evans would testify in Hallin's slander case against Minnie McDuffee that he had investigated the rumors surrounding Hallin and was unable to substantiate them. In 1938, he traveled to Amherst, New Hampshire and helped convince Saugus High School graduate and college football star Harrington Gates to leave The Holy Ghost and Us Society, a cult led by Frank Sandford, and return to Dartmouth College. In 1940, he expelled two more Jehovah's Witnesses for refusing to salute the flag. Evans retired from the Saugus School System in 1951. Board of Selectmen In 1955, Evans was elected to the Saugus Board of Selectmen. In 1958, the Board selected John B. Kennedy to serve as Town Manager. Evans, who voted for temporary Town Manager Arthur Gustafson instead of Kennedy, chose not to swear him in and Town Clerk Ruth E. Stevens administered the oath instead. In 1961, the Board voted to ban dancing and other entertainment on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. On February 20, 1962 the Board of Selectmen voted 3 to 2 to appoint John O. Stinson Town Manager with Evans voting for Clarence Wilkinson. Evans would later become a supporter of Stinson and was the only Selectmen who opposed his firing in 1967, although he was unable to attend the meeting due to illness. Evans would vote to appoint temporary manager Stanley Day to permanently succeed Stinson, however Paul H. Boucher was chosen by a 3 to 2 vote. The Board would unanimously vote to fire Boucher six months later and Clarence Wilkinson was appointed to succeed him on a 3 to 2 vote, with Evans once again supporting him. Personal life Evans was married to Gladys Wyatt of Prince Edward Island. The couple had one son, Vernon W. Evans, Jr., who would serve as a Florida Circuit Court judge. The two divorced and Evans, Jr. grew up with his mother's family. On September 16, 1931, Evans married his second wife, Annie M. Emrick, at the Center Congregational Church in Lynn, Massachusetts. Notes :1. The 13th Essex District sent three representatives to the Massachusetts House of Representatives during Evans' tenure. In 1920, Evans and Tony Garofano succeeded Ernest W. Allen and Thomas W. Baxter. The third member, Daniel J. Hayden, was reelected. :2. In 1925, Harriet Russell Hart and Fred A. Hutchinson succeeded Evans and Ralph H. Burckes. The third member, Tony Garofano, was reelected.

Discovery and naming It contains a single species, Proa valdearinnoensis. The generic name is from the Spanish word \\"proa\\" (meaning \\"prow\\"), which alludes to the pointed shape of the animal's predentary bone; while the specific name is derived from Val de Ari√±o, the traditional name for the coal mines near where the first fossils were found. The animal was described on the basis of three partial skeletons and several skull elements from different individuals. Description Proa is distinguished from other basal hadrosauriforms (especially other iguanodontids) in having a predentary that reaches the rostral margin, with divergent lateral processes. It can also be diagnosed by a unique combination of characters: dentary tooth row convex dorsally in lateral view; dentary tooth row extending caudal to the base of the coronoid process; platform between the dentary tooth row and the base of the coronoid process; coronoid process expanded along rostral and caudal margins; maxilla lacks a rostrodorsal process; quadrate straight in lateral view; ilium with dorsal margin convex dorsally, non-pendant supraacetabular process, and postacetabular process that tapers without a break in slope along its dorsal margin; cranial pubic process concave along its dorsal margin but lacks expansion of distal end. Phylogeny McDonald et al. (2012) recover Proa at the base of Hadrosauriformes along with Iguanodon. In his osteology of Hypselospinus, Norman (2015) recovered Proa in a monophyletic Iguanodontidae as closer to the East Asian Bolong and Jinzhousaurus than to other European members of Iguanodontidae.Norman, D. B. (2015). \\"On the history, osteology, and systematic position of the Wealden (Hastings group) dinosaur Hypselospinus fittoni (Iguanodontia: Styracosterna)\\".

Their sect is disputed; some sources mention they were Shia, others Sunni. They were the remnants of Banu Abdul Qays tribe and seized the country from the Qarmatians with the military assistance of Great Seljuq Empire in the year 1077-1078 AD.C.E. Bosworth, The New Islamic Dynasties, (Columbia University Press, 1996), 94-95. It then fell to the Usfurids of Banu Uqayl in 651 AH (1253 AD). The famous poet Ali bin al Mugrab Al Uyuni is a descendant of the Uyunids. History Rise In 1077-1078, an Arab sheikh named Abdullah bin Ali Al Uyuni defeated the Qarmatians in Bahrain and al-Hasa with the help of the Seljuq Turks of Baghdad and founded the Uyunid dynasty. Then Al-Fadhl, son of Abdullah, transferred his capital to Qatif, then to Awal (today‚Äôs state of Bahrain). In his reign, the state extended to Kuwait. Then in 513 H. the Capital went back to Qatif. In 531 AH Mohammed son of Al Fadhl I was assassinated, and his state was divided into two, one in al-Hasa and the other in Qatif. Expansion Under Muhammad b. Ahmad b. Abu'l-Hussin b. Abu Sinan, the Uyunids' territory stretched from Najd to the Syrian desert. Due to the influence of the Uyunid kingdom, Caliph al-Nasir li-Din Allah gave Muhammad b. Ahmad authority to protect the pilgrimage route to Mecca. Muhammad was later murdered by a family member, instigated by his cousin, Gharir b. Shukr b. Ali. In the years 587 ‚Äì 605 AH, Mohammed bin Abi al-Hussain united Qatif and Al-Hasa. He restores the glory of the Uyunids, and extends the state to Najd central Arabia. The state was divided again after his assassination in 605 H. Religion The Uyunids were Muslim, however their sect is disputed; some sources mention they were Shia, others Sunni. According to Nakash, the populations of Bahrain, Hasa, and Qatif, may have accepted Twelver Shi'ism during this period.Yitzhak Nakash, Reaching for Power:The Shi'a in the Modern Arab World, (Princeton University Press, 2006), 22. A study by Nayef al-Shera'an stated they were Shia based on their coins, which he said were exhibited at the British Museum. The study also mentions that no reliable sources support they were Sunni. On the other hand, Iraqi Sunni historian Safa Khulusi said they were Sunni, shortly before stating he had a \\"strong feeling\\" that poet Ali bin al Mugrab Al Uyuni was a Zaydi Shia.

It fought alongside the Imperial Russian army on the Eastern Front. Between 1915 and 1918, 444 Belgian soldiers served with the unit of whom 16 were killed in action. History Items of uniform worn by members of the Expeditionary Force In August 1914, the German Empire invaded neutral Belgium. The campaign was initially very successful, pushing the Belgian, French and British forces westwards. By the end of 1914, however, the Western Front had stabilised into static trench warfare. Following the Battle of the Yser in October, the Belgian army remained entrenched along the Yser Front and was left with a number of armoured cars which could not be used. In early 1915, the Russian Tsar Nicholas II formally requested military support from King Albert I and a self- contained unit was formed for service in Russia.White, B. T. Tanks and Other Armoured Fighting Vehicles 1900-1918, Blandford Press, 1974. p129-130. As Belgium was officially an independent neutral power rather than an ally of the Russian Empire Belgian soldiers in this unit were officially considered as volunteers in the Imperial Russian Army itself. The first contingent of the Belgian Expeditionary Corps (333 volunteers equipped with Mors and Peugeot armoured cars) arrived in Archangel in October 1915. The unit fought with distinction in Galicia and was mentioned in the Order of the Day five times.August Thiry & Dirk Van Cleemput (2015), King Albert's Heroes - Hoe 400 jonge Belgen vochten in Rusland en de VS veroverden, Antwerpen, Houtekiet, 428 p & 100 p photo's After the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, the Belgian force remained in Russia until the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk withdrew Russia from the war. After the ceasefire, the unit found itself in hostile territory. As the route north to Murmansk was blocked, the soldiers destroyed their armoured cars to prevent their capture by Bolshevik forces. The unit finally reached the United States through China and the Trans-Siberian railway in June 1918. A similar, slightly larger British unit, the Armoured Car Expeditionary Force (ACEF), also served in Russia during the same period. Notable personnel Map depicting the unit's operations in Galicia The unit was never particularly numerous, but included some notable personnel: * Henri Herd, known as \\"Constant le Marin\\", who was a prominent boxer and 4-time World Champion *Henry George, track cyclist who won a gold medal at the 1920 Summer Olympics *Julien Lahaut, politician and chief of the Communist Party of Belgium who was assassinated in 1950. *Marcel Thiry, Walloon poet, who served in the corps with his brother Oscar. *Th√©o Halleux, construction contractor who built the first high multi-storey buildings in Li√®ge. Commemoration From 1931, soldiers who had served with the unit were awarded the 1914‚Äì1918 Commemorative War Medal with a bar (reading \\"1916‚ÄîR‚Äî1917\\" or \\"1916‚ÄîR‚Äî1918\\") denoting service in Russia. The last veteran of the unit died in 1992. In 2014‚Äì15, the Royal Museum of the Armed Forces and Military History in Brussels raised 40,000 euros towards building a replica Mors-Minerva armoured car. The result, first exhibited in 2015 in the insignia of the Expeditionary Corps, went on display in 2015. In fiction and popular culture The 2015 Belgian animated drama- action film Cafard (\\"Cockroach\\" in French) tells the story of a boxer, Jean Mordant (based on the real-life Henri Herd, known as Constant le Marin), who joins the Expeditionary Corps in order to avenge the rape of his daughter by German soldiers in Occupied Belgium.

He is president and chief executive officer of O'Shares Investments, a U.S.-based ETF adviser, as well as president, chief executive officer and chief investment officer of Stanton Asset Management, a Montreal- based investment-management company, which he founded in 2002. O'Brien had previously established a private-equity investment firm, Stanton Capital Corporation, in New York City. Before establishing his own businesses, he held positions at Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers. O'Brien is a former alpine skier who represented the United Kingdom in the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo and Estonia in the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer. Early life and education O'Brien was born and raised in Montreal and holds British and Estonian citizenship, as well as Canadian. His father was born and raised in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and his mother immigrated to Canada from Estonia as a child in 1944. When Estonia gained its independence from the Soviet Union, O'Brien became an Estonian citizen by birthright. O'Brien attended schools in Montreal and went on to Middlebury College in Vermont, where he received a BA degree in physics and economics and was a member of Middlebury's alpine ski team. He then earned an MBA from the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College.  Business career  O'Brien began his career as an associate at Lehman Brothers and then moved to Merrill Lynch, where he was a vice-president for mergers and acquisitions (M&A;). In 1995, he founded Stanton Capital Corporation, a private-equity investment firm. One of Stanton Capital's first ventures was in the privatization of the Peruvian state-owned steel company SiderPeru. Stanton acted as the financial partner of a team of private investors that included Acerco S.A., as industry partner, and Wiese Inversiones Financieras S.A., an affiliate of Banco Wiese, to acquire the Peruvian steel company SiderPeru. The consortium, named Sider Corp, acquired 96.46% of Siderperu in 1996. Siderperu's employees acquired the remaining 3.54% of Siderperu's share capital. Stanton sold its share to its consortium partners in January 2001. Stanton ventured into shipping in 1997 when it assembled a team of investors to partner with the Norwegian shipping company Tschudi & Eitzen to acquire ESCO, an Estonian state-owned shipping company that was privatized through O'Brien's family links to Estonia. According to the business daily Aripaev, ESCO has in the last four years accumulated huge debt, and its main shareholders were suspected of siphoning capital out of the company. Stanton sold its interest to Tschudi & Eitzen in June 2001 in order to recoup some money after dismal showings in both MaritimeDirect and Millenium Seacarriers. Stanton followed the ESCO investment by teaming with shipping-industry executive Vassilios M. (Bill) Livanos in 1998 to form Millenium Seacarriers, Inc., a United States-based dry-bulk shipping company that eventually owned and operated a fleet of up to 22 bulk carriers. Millenium Seacarriers faced difficulties when market conditions and charter rates for the dry-bulk shipping sector deteriorated in the early 2000s. By 2001, bondholder Wayland Investment filed suit against Millenium Seacarriers and O'Brien claiming they \\"enriched themselves at the expense of the bondholders and other investors and creditors\\" by charging high management fees and executing a number of irregular sale-and-purchase transactions. Millenium settled the suit 2002 and gave up 17 ships, all but one of its remaining fleet. It eventually filed for restructuring in a bankruptcy proceeding. O'Brien and Livanos also launched MaritimeDirect.com, an internet-based maritime information and e-commerce site, in 1999. MaritimeDirect weakened as a result of downturns in the dry-bulk shipping industry, overly optimistic projections, and the decline in tech-sector financing. Under pressure from creditors, it ceased operations in 2001. O'Brien returned to Canada with his family in 2001 and dissolved Stanton Capital in the U.S. He founded Stanton Asset Management in Canada the next year, and in 2004 launched two funds of hedge funds, Stanton International Equity and the Stanton Diversified Strategies funds. After four years in which, according to O'Brien, fund investors saw accumulated returns of some 30% in addition to tax breaks, the funds suffered significant losses in late 2008. Some investors lost as much as 70% of their money, and O'Brien was forced to suspend redemptions. O'Brien teamed with Canadian businessman and reality-television personality Kevin O'Leary in 2010 to form O'Leary Funds. O'Leary Funds suffered losses in 2011, but initial reports of large losses and redemptions by investors were modified when analysts considered the way the funds were structured and the fact that the funds paid distributions, which increased value to investors. Both analysts and fund partners O'Leary and O'Brien acknowledged that the funds employed complicated strategies that made losses look larger initially than they were. The firm was eventually sold to Canoe Financial in 2016, when O'Leary Funds had about $750 million under management. In 2014, the Autorit√© des march√©s financiers charged O'Leary Funds with failing to comply with various provisions under the Securities Act, namely, the restriction regarding securities concentration in a portfolio, the requirement to publish and file in a timely manner a press release informing the public about changes to a fund's fundamental investment objectives, the requirement to hold insurance coverage in accordance with regulations and the requirement to notify the AMF of any change to the information filed for registration purposes. With respect to the latter requirement, O'Leary Funds had failed to declare that it was the subject of a counterclaim for damages. O'Leary settled and agreed to pay penalties. O'Leary Funds entered a legal dispute with Canadian energy company Boralex Inc. in 2010 over Boralex's proposed takeover of the Boralex Power Income Fund. Boralex owned 23 per cent of the trust, and O'Leary Funds held about 9.4 percent. O'Leary Funds contended that the proposed amendment to Boralex Power Income Fund's trust agreement was illegal, and petitioned the Montreal District Superior Court for the Province of Qu√©bec for a safeguard order (injunction), or ordonnance de sauvegarde, to prevent Boralex from proceeding with the sale. The petition was rejected, but the court ruled that O'Leary Funds had sufficient cause to seek damages in civil court. The case was still before the court as of February 2017. In 2015 O'Brien and O'Leary formed O'Shares Investments, a firm offering investments to U.S. investors exclusively in ETFs. Sports career O'Brien began skiing at an early age and has skied for four countries: Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and Estonia. He was a member of the Middlebury College alpine ski team and skied for the United States while in college. Skiing under the British flag, he finished 33rd in the downhill at the Sarajevo Winter Olympic Games in 1984. Temporarily coming out of retirement and while working on Wall Street, he returned to the Olympic Games in 1994 to ski for his mother's native country, Estonia, which had recently gained independence from the Soviet Union.

Since 2014 she is Dean of the Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Vienna.Biography at the webpage of the University of Vienna Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Vienna  Research  Ulrike Felt has published widely in different areas of Science, Technology, and Society. Throughout her work, questions of the public engagement with science and of science policy have been a major concern for Felt. Her work on public perception of different technologies, the organisation and reflection of different participatory events as well as on the complex relations of science and democracy has contributed in many innovative ways to the debates in STS and beyond. An important line of her work has focused on changing modes of knowledge production within the sciences, and on how this impacts ways of working and living within research cultures. She has introduced the concept of ‚Äúepistemic living spaces‚Äù Felt, Ulrike (ed.) (2009): Knowing and Living in Academic Research. Convergence and Heterogeneity in Research Cultures in the European Context (Prague: Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic). in order to describe how the social and epistemic are co-produced within scientific work spaces: \\"By epistemic living space, we mean researchers‚Äô individual or collective perceptions and narrative re-constructions of the structures, contexts, rationales, actors and values which mould, guide and delimit their potential actions, both in what they aim to know as well as in how they act in social contexts in science and beyond.\\" (Felt/Fochler 2010: 4f)Felt, Ulrike and Fochler, Maximilian (2012) 'Re- ordering Epistemic Living Spaces: On the Tacit Governance Effects of the Public Communication of Science', in R√∂dder, S., Franzen, M. and P. Weingart (eds), The Sciences' Media Connection ‚Äì Communication to the Public and its Repercussions. Sociology of the Sciences Yearbook 28 (Dortrecht: Springer): 133-154. Using this concept, she has pointed to the potential implications of recent changes within career structures and the organization of the sciences for the knowledge produced within contemporary societies, focusing recently on changing temporal orders of research practices and policy. Another line of her work has focused on how science and technology are embedded within local and national contexts. By introducing the notion of ‚Äútechnopolitical cultures‚Äù (Felt et al. 2010),Felt, Ulrike, Fochler, Maximilian and Winkler, Peter (2010) 'Coming to Terms with Biomedical Technologies in Different Technopolitical Cultures. A Comparative Analysis of Focus Groups on Organ Transplantation and Genetic Testing in Austria, France, and the Netherlands', Science, Technology, & Human Values 35/4: 525-553. Felt has pointed to the nationally distinct ways of how technoscience is entangled with cultural norms and values. Further, she is interested in how novel technologies like nano or genetic testing become imagined and integrated within specific local contexts. These questions are closely tied to her methodological interests. Felt and the Department of Social Studies of Science have engaged not only in the development of novel qualitative social science methods, but also in reflecting the performativity and politics of both participatory engagements and traditional socio- scientific methods. More recently, and lying across her different research interests, she has been engaging with the role of changing temporal structures and the growing importance of future in shaping the interface of science, technology and society. Finally, since late 2015 she is leading a new interfaculty research platform at the University of Vienna \\"Responsible Research and Innovation in Academic Practice\\".

Radiocarbon dates obtained in the 1970s suggest that the inner wall was constructed in the 4th century. Excavations at this time revealed evidence of Pictish occupation, including metal-working implements and French pottery, dating from the 7th century. The fort is a scheduled monument.

Kachin insurgents have been fighting government soldiers since 1961, with only one ceasefire being brokered between them, which lasted for 17 years from 1994 to 2011. Since the resumption of hostilities in 2011, thousands of civilians have been killed, whilst over 100,000 have been displaced. Widespread use of landmines, child soldiers, systematic rape and torture have been alleged by both sides.  Background  The Kachin people (or Jingpo) are a confederation of six ethnic groups whose homeland encompasses territory in the Kachin Hills of northern Myanmar, in southern China (Yunnan) and in northeastern India. Following Burmese independence from the United Kingdom, many ethnic minorities, including the Kachins, campaigned for self-determination and independence. The Kachin Independence Organisation (KIO) was founded in 1960 by dissidents as a result of the grievances between the majority-Bamar union government and the Kachin people. The Kachin Independence Army (KIA) was established as its armed wing in 1961, acting as a private army with 27 members. In the early 1960s the KIA began expanding and increasing in numbers, especially after the 1962 Burmese coup d'√©tat and its perceived threat by ethnic minorities.  First conflict (1961‚Äì1994)  Following the unilateral abrogation of the Union of Burma's constitution by General Ne Win and his regime in 1962, many Kachin soldiers in the Tatmadaw (armed forces) defected and joined the Kachin Independence Army (KIA). The KIA did not only fight government soldiers, but occasionally clashed with communists outside and inside their own ranks. The Communist Party of Burma (CPB) had periodically been the KIA's ally and enemy during different years, and a communist-backed faction split from the KIA in 1989, becoming the New Democratic Army - Kachin (NDA-K). Aside from its major towns and railway corridor, KIA-controlled areas in Kachin State remained virtually independent and isolated from the rest of Myanmar from the mid-1960s through 1994, with an economy based on cross-border jade trade with China and narcotics trafficking. After a military offensive by the Myanmar Army in 1994 seized most of the jade mines in Kachin State, the KIA signed a ceasefire agreement with the then-ruling SLORC military junta on 24 February 1994, which resulted in an end to large-scale fighting that lasted until June 2011.  Second conflict (2011‚Äìpresent)   2011  Armed clashes erupted between the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) and the Myanmar Army on 9 June 2011, when government forces broke the ceasefire and attacked KIA positions along the Taping River east of Bhamo, Kachin State, near the Taping hydroelectric plant. Fighting occurred throughout Kachin State, as well as northwestern parts of Shan State. On 14 June 2014, KIA insurgents captured two hydroelectric plants and took six government soldiers and several Chinese workers hostage for several hours, before the Myanmar Army stormed the buildings. A total of six people were killed and four others were wounded in the incident. According to news reports, the recent fighting broke out as a result of the Burmese government's attempts to seize KIA-controlled areas, which are located around lucrative energy projects in Kachin and Shan State backed by the Chinese government. Despite a December 2011 statement by Myanmar's President Thein Sein that he had ordered the Myanmar Army to cease its offensive in Kachin State, the conflict continued into 2012.  2012  In 2012, the largest battles of the reignited conflict occurred in March, along the Myitkyina‚ÄìBhamo road. In April, the battle for Pangwa in Chipwi Township near Luchang was fought between the KIA and the government soldiers. Clashes erupted again in late April, when the KIA launched an offensive to capture Burmese military posts around Pangwa. The KIA offensive succeeded and the Myanmar Army retreated from the area by the end of April. In August, the KIA claimed that 140 government troops were killed when they exploded mines buried inside the Myauk Phyu (\\"White Monkey\\") jade mine, which was owned by the Wai Aung Kaba Company.  2013‚Äì2014  Fortified KIA positions were heavily damaged by airstrikes and artillery launched by the Myanmar Army from December 2012 to January 2013. On 19 November 2014, government soldiers attacked the KIA's headquarters near Laiza, killing at least 22 insurgents.  2018  In March 2018, the Tatmadaw (Myanmar Armed Forces) launched airstrikes against the KIA in Tanai Township, which is part of a large mining region. Between 1 and 6 April 2018, Tatmadaw soldiers allegedly attacked KIA positions in the KIA-controlled Mansi Township, though no reports of fighting emerged from the region. The KIA later raided the Tatmadaw's Battalion 86 military base in Hpakant Township on 6 April 2018, killing eight government soldiers and capturing 13. By 10 April 2018, locals claimed that 18 Tatmadaw soldiers and three KIA insurgents had been killed in the clashes. Accusations of abuses perpetrated by the Tatmadaw against civilians emerged in March and April 2018, which included allegations that Tatmadaw soldiers specifically targeted and killed two Kachin and six Shanni farmers. Several civilians were also wounded in the crossfire. By May 2018, 6,000 IDPs had fled armed clashes and shelling by the Myanmar Army, whilst hundreds more remained trapped in villages caught between the crossfire. Hunger became a prevalent issue for IDPs, with some resorting to eating banana stems.  Ceasefire attempts  Numerous rounds of ceasefire talks have taken place between the Kachin Independence Army and the government of Myanmar since fighting resumed in June 2011. According to an 18 December 2012 report by Swedish journalist Bertil Lintner in the Hong Kong-based Asia Times Online, many people have criticised the foreign backed ceasefire efforts for \\"avoiding discussions of political issues and only emphasizing ceasefires, disarmament and economic development, those interlocutors‚Äîincluding a 'Peace Support Initiative' sponsored by the Norwegian government and in a separate initiative the Switzerland-based Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue‚Äîare essentially promoting the government's view\\". The Australian reported that some Kachin Business leaders were calling on Aung San Suu Kyi to help mediate the dispute and on 6 January 2012, Aung San Suu Kyi said that she could not step into the negotiations without an official invitation from the government to do so, which she had not received. = 2013 ceasefire talks = On 18 January 2013, immediately prior to an international donors conference in Myanmar, President Thein Sein announced a unilateral ceasefire in the war between the army and the KIO. The ceasefire was said to take effect the following day, on 19 January, but light fighting was also reported the following day and a full-scale government assault was reportedly launched on 20 January and included \\"sustained mortar and artillery fire\\" followed by \\"hundreds of Burmese troops\\" storming a KIA base on the outskirts of rebel-held town of Laiza. The government of Thein Sein was reported to be under pressure from \\"political and business circles\\" who believed the \\"escalating conflict would undermine Myanmar‚Äôs emergence from decades of diplomatic isolation\\" and had passed a resolution in parliament calling on Min Aung Hlaing, the military's commander-in-chief, to scale down the war. Min Aung Hlaing responded by stating that the military would only carry out attacks only in \\"self-defense\\"‚Äîthe rationale it has consistently given since December 2011 for prosecuting a war against the KIA and the rationale it gave for allowing airstrikes on rebel positions starting on 26 December 2012. On 4 February, Burmese government and the Kachin Independence Army met in Ruili, China and agreed to reduce military tension in Kachin State and hold further peace talks later in February. However no talks took place later in February but almost no armed clash reportedly happened in Kachin State after the peace talks. According to Mizzima news, on 26 February a KIO central committee member claimed that they would not be meeting with the government in February because they needed more time to consult with the \\"Kachin people\\" regarding the negotiations. Burmese government and KIA renewed peace talks in Ruili, China on 11 March 2013. The Chinese government's refusal to allow observers from western countries at peace talks had delayed negotiations, despite the Chinese rejecting the allegations. On 30 May, Burmese government and Kachin Independence Army signed a preliminary ceasefire agreement that would lead to further progress towards reaching a peace deal. The parties however, failed to reach an official ceasefire agreement. United Nations special adviser on Myanmar, Vijay Nambiar, also joined the meeting as an observer, along with representatives of China and other ethnic minorities. However, the Burmese government and Kachin Independence Army failed to reach a permanent ceasefire agreement after several peace talks in 2013, but agreed to work together towards permanent ceasefire agreement and reduce hostilities. = 2014 ceasefire talks = Renewed fighting broke out in April 2014 when the Burmese army attacked various KIA positions around Mansi Township, Kachin State and northern Shan State to eradicate timber smuggling and to control strategic routes around their strongholds. The Kachin Independence Army requested a meeting in Myitkyina on 10 May to lessen tensions between the sides. Negotiations aimed at drafting a nationwide ceasefire agreement began in April 2014 at the Myanmar Peace Centre between representatives of various ethnic armed groups and the Burmese government, but the KIA and Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) were not among the negotiators. The KIA's deputy commander-in-chief Gun Maw urged the United States to get involved in the peace process in April 2014.  Airstrikes  On 2 January 2013, the Burmese government confirmed that it carried out airstrikes a few days earlier against the ethnic rebels in northern Kachin, in response to attacks by the Kachin Independence Army. The US government stated that it would \\"be formally expressing our concern\\" over the escalation of force used by Myanmar government. On 3 January 2013, the KIA alleged that air-strikes had continued to occur for the sixth consecutive day in the area around Laiza and there were allegations that the Myanmar Armed Forces was also using chemical weapons UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon stated following the incidents that Burma's authorities should \\"desist from any action that could endanger the lives of civilians living in the area or further intensify conflict in the region\\".  Civilians and refugees  Civilians have also been killed in fighting as well as having been specifically targeted. Civilians were often displaced by fighting and faced dangers such as landmines which were frequently laid by government and rebel forces without regard for civilians. Although some civilians had crossed the border with China most remained in northern Burma as of December 2012. Refugees were being forced by the Chinese government back into Myanmar in August 2012 despite the continued fighting there and the illegality of forcibly returning civilians to war zones under international law. Women have played a significant role in the conflict as both combatants and victims. Time Magazine documented the presence of many female KIA soldiers in 2012. In February 2013 the NGO Kachin Women's Association Thailand (KWAT) reported that the fighting had created over 100,000 refugees and that 364 villages had been wholly or partially abandoned since 2011. The organisation's report also stated that the Burmese Army deliberately attacked refugee camps and villages as well as committed alleged \\"war crimes\\" such as the rape and murder of civilians. The United Nations stated on 28 April 2018 that more than 4,000 people were displaced since armed clashes resumed earlier in the month.  Child soldiers  Child soldiers are a major part of the Myanmar Army's and insurgent groups' soldiers. The Independent reported in June 2012 that children were being sold to the Burmese military for \\"as little as $40 and a bag of rice or a can of petrol\\". The UN's Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, Radhika Coomaraswamy, who stepped down from her position a week later, met representatives of the Government of Myanmar on 5 July 2012, and stated that she hoped the government's signing of an action plan would \\"signal a transformation\\". In September 2012, the Tatmadaw (armed forces) released 42 child soldiers and the International Labour Organization met with representatives of the government as well as the Kachin Independence Army to secure the release of more child soldiers. According to Samantha Power, a US delegation raised the issue of child soldiers with the government in October 2012, however, she did not comment on the government's progress towards reform in this area. A Bangkok Post article on 23 December 2012, reported that the Myanmar Armed Forces continued to use child soldiers including during the army's large offensive against the KIA.

It is the second of three film adaptations of the 1926 novel Smoky the Cowhorse by Will James; others were made in 1933 and 1966. Plot A cowboy riding alone in Utah witnesses a stampede of wild stallions, one of whom particularly catches his eye. He returns the horse to its rightful owner, Julie Richards, owner of the Rocking R Ranch, introducing himself as Clint Barkley and asking for a job. The wild horse, Smoky, slowly develops a relationship with Clint, but ranch foreman Jeff doesn't trust the new hired hand, who is vague and mysterious about his past. A stranger arrives named Frank and persuades a reluctant Clint to vouch for him to be hired as a wrangler. It turns out Clint took the blame for a crime Frank committed and served eight months behind bars. Frank begins causing trouble at the ranch, mistreating Smoky and the other horses. A gambler turns up, seeking Clint's payment for a $200 debt, discovering that Frank actually lost the money and forged Clint's name on the IOU. Frank rustles the horses and rides off. Jeff remains suspicious until Clint finally reveals that Frank is his brother. Smoky, abused again, fights off Frank and ends up killing him. Other cowboys discover the horse and sell him to a rodeo in Cheyenne. The horse's condition deteriorates and he ends up pulling a junk cart. One day Clint rides into town and Smoky recognizes him. They are reunited, and return to Julie and the ranch.

Early life He was the younger son of Sir Thomas Hamilton of Preston Tower, a Royalist, who fought as lieutenant-colonel at the battle of Dunbar in 1650, and at the battle of Worcester, in the cause of the Stuarts. After his death in 1672 a baronetcy was conferred in 1673 on his eldest son. Sir William. He then took part in the expedition of Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll in 1685, escaped to Holland, accompanied the Prince of Orange to England in 1688, but died at Exeter, when the troops were on the march to London. Robert Hamilton, the younger son, was educated at the University of Glasgow under the care of Gilbert Burnet, whose sister was his step-mother. He began to attend conventicles, and became an extreme Covenanter. Campaign of 1679 Along with Thomas Douglas and Hackston of Rathillet he, in 1679, drew up what became known as the \\"Rutherglen declaration\\", which they intended on 29 May, the king's birthday, to nail to the market-cross of Glasgow. The advance of the troops of John Graham of Claverhouse prevented that, and Rutherglen, about two miles to the east of Glasgow, was chosen instead. They extinguished the bonfire in the king's honour and lit another, where they proceeded to burn all the acts of parliament and royal proclamations made since the Restoration. They then retired towards Evandale and Newmilns, preparing to hold an armed convention on the following Sunday at Loudon Hill. Battle of Drumclog Claverhouse, who had gone to Rutherglen, came suddenly in sight of the gathering. Sending away their women and children the covenanters drew up in battle array on the farm of Drumclog, a little to the east. Nominally Hamilton was in command, but the experienced officers, such as Hackston and Cleland, led the separate detachments of the Covenanters, defeating Claverhouse was due. Hamilton, however, showed some energy after the fight. In a vindication of his conduct, 7 December 1685, published in Faithful Contendings displayed, for having put to death one of the prisoners after the battle with his own hand, he asserted that before the battle began he had given out the word that \\"no quarter should be given\\". Battle of Bothwell Bridge The troops had barricaded Glasgow, and the Covenanters were easily repulsed. They halted at the position occupied on the previous night, but on Claverhouse advancing towards them retreated to Hamilton. As Claverhouse was too weak to attack them here, they formed a camp, and according to Hamilton numbered within a week five or six thousand men. Hamilton took all the credit for the victory at Drumclog, and assumed command without ceremony. Time was spent in harangues and theological disputes. After the withdrawal of the government forces to Stirling the Covenanters advanced to Glasgow, where they are stated to have robbed the archbishop's house, to have pulled down the ornaments of the cathedral, and to have defaced several of the monuments, but having done so they fell back on their old position. The arrival in the camp of John Welch, with a reinforcement of men from Ayr, introduced a disturbing element. Welch was prepared to accept a compromise with the government by which both episcopacy and presbyterianism should be tolerated. He was therefore denounced by the Hamilton party as an Erastian, and the dispute raged till the appearance of the government forces under the Duke of Monmouth. Welch and others, though much in the minority, drew up a declaration, which they presented on 22 June in the hope that it would lead to at least a suspension of hostilities. The declaration is known as the Hamilton declaration, in reference to the town where it was drawn up. Sir Robert Hamilton, in name of the army, also signed a petition to Monmouth, and afterwards, when taunted with this, said that he had been ensnared into the subscription by the belief that it was Donald Cargill's work. When the Hamilton declaration was presented, the armies were drawn up facing each other on opposite banks of the River Clyde at Bothwell Bridge. Monmouth refused to consider terms until they had laid down their arms. Hamilton occupied himself with the erection of a gigantic gibbet, around which was placed a cartload of new ropes, but as soon as the action began his courage ebbed away. He ordered Hackston to retire when the bridge was attacked, and himself 'rode off with the horse' and 'allowed the foot to shift for themselves,' thus 'leaving the world to debate whether he acted most like a traitor, coward, or fool'. Hamilton's courage was doubted. Burnet, in a passage omitted from the earlier editions of his Own Time,' calls him an 'ignominious coward,' and Robert Wodrow speaks of his behaviour at Bothwell Bridge as 'ill conduct, not to say cowardice.' During the attack on Glasgow he is said to have waited the issue in a place of safety. In any case he was incompetent as a commander, and displayed feebleness. Later life Hamilton fled to Holland, whereupon he was outlawed, and sentenced to be executed whenever apprehended. While in Holland he acted as commissioner 'to the persecuted true presbyterian church in Scotland,' and in this capacity he visited Germany and Switzerland. In 1683 he prevailed on the presbytery of Groningen to ordain James Renwick, who had studied at the university there, as minister to the presbyterian church in Scotland. At the Glorious Revolution in 1688 Hamilton returned to Scotland, and, his attainder having been reversed, succeeded in that year to the baronetcy on the death of his brother Sir William. He declined to claim his brother's estates, on the ground that it would involve the \\"acknowledging an uncovenanted sovereign of these covenanted nations\\". He was unmarried and privately took measures for securing the entailed settlement of the family inheritance on the issue of his brother's daughter Anne, by her husband Thomas, son of Sir James Oswald. On 20 October 1686 a letter had been sent to Hamilton by the united societies stating that they had information ready to be proven 'that he had countenanced the Hamilton declaration which he and his party since had cried out so much against; that he had signed a petition to Monmouth in name of the army ; that he had received large sums of money from good people in Holland for printing the testimonies of the sufferers, and yet greater for the support of the suffering party in Scotland, of which he had given no accounts'. On his return to Scotland he continued, however, to retain his influence with the extreme Covenanters. On 9 November 1689 he protested against the 'compliance at Hamilton,' by which it was agreed by a section of the covenanters to form the Cameronian regiment, of which William Cleland was appointed colonel. Suspected of having drawn up and published the Sanquhar declaration of 18 August 1692, Hamilton was arrested at Earlstown on 10 September, and for some months he was detained a prisoner at Edinburgh and Haddington. He was several times brought before the privy council for examination, but, although declining to acknowledge their jurisdiction or the authority of William and Mary, received his liberty on 15 May 1693, and was permitted to remain unmolested till his death, 20 October 1701.

There is 1 vacant anchor store that was once Sears. History Northwoods Mall opened in 1973 and was designed by architects Sidney H. Morris & Associates of Chicago, with Harold Carson Associates as the manager. The original anchor stores upon opening were Montgomery Ward, Carson Pirie Scott (shortened later to Carson's), and JCPenney. Original tenants included Helzberg Diamonds, B. Dalton, Claire's, GNC, a Fannie May candy shop, a bank, Brown's Sporting Goods, and several restaurants. The mall was sold to Simon Property Group in 1983. Carson's closed that same year and was replaced two years later by Famous-Barr. Also in 1983, a botulism outbreak at the mall's Skewer Inn restaurant affected 28 customers. Montgomery Ward closed its store in the mall in 1997, and Sears occupied its space a year later. A 2005 renovation added a food court. The Famous-Barr store was re-branded as Macy's in 2006. On January 7, 2016, it was announced that Macy's would close in March 2016 as part of a plan to close 40 stores nationwide. In 2017, Round One Entertainment moved into part of the vacant Macy's store on the 1st floor which opened on November 18, 2017. In 2018, it was announced that The RoomPlace would move into the rest of the half vacant Macy's store on the 2nd floor which opened on May 11, 2018. On May 25, 2018 a Peoria police substation opened at the mall which is located on the upper level close to Sears. On August 24, 2018 it was announced that Hibbett Sports will open on September 15, 2018. The new store will open on the upper level close to Sears. On September 25, 2018 it was announced that a new store Go! Calendars, Games and Toys opened a few days ago. The space was once occupied by Hallmark Cards. On November 1, 2018 it was announced that an indoor Knockerball facility would open. The facility will open on the upper level next to Sears and will be open to the public as well as hosting private events. On November 20, 2018 it was announced that Forever 21 would open in the mall in summer 2020 but it might not ever open because of its bankruptcy. On November 7, 2019, it was announced that Sears would close in February 2020 as part of a plan to close 96 stores nationwide. After Sears closed, JCPenney became the only remaining traditional anchor store left. Sears closed on February 16, 2020. In 2020, Spirit Halloween will serve as a temporary anchor store in the former Sears.

It is situated on the north end of the island of Lido di Venezia. It is also known as Giovanni Nicelli AirportSgt. Giovanni Nicelli (born 1893) has been an ace of the Italian Air Force. 8 confirmed victories, 3 Silver Medals. Died due to structural failure of his plane in March, 1918. and was formerly known as Venice-San Nicol√≤ Airport Nicelli is a general aviation airport, and since March 2019, thanks to a new administration, it has come back to life with a fresh reorganization and restructuring. Located in the prestigious setting of Lido of Venice in the norther part of the island, the airport is only ten minutes by boat from the city center. The gras runway is 994x45 m (3264x148 ft), with orientation 05/23. The airport is also equipped with a helipad, with a 25x35 m (82x114 ft) grass landing area. Equipped with elegant indoor spaces and large gardens and outdoor terraces, it is the ideal location for meetings and conferences, dinners and private event, exclusive parties, art exhibitions and film shoots.  History  The long and fascinating history of the Giovanni Nicelli Airport begins around the 1920s when the Lido of Venice became a cultured destination, located between the sea and the lagoon. It is precisely in that stimulating environment that a young entrepreneur from Ancona, the 24-years-old engineer Renato Morandi, conceives the first Italian civil airport, when not even major cities like Rome and Milan didn‚Äôt yet dedicated a commercial traffic hub. The passenger station of the airport was solemnly inaugurated by the Duke of Genova on February 4th, 1935. The airport was in fact defined as the best one in Italy, the most modern, innovative and equipped with various services. The entire operation was managed by the Province of Venice which, thanks to an agreement with the administration of the Aeronautics, acted as ‚Äúcommissioned body‚Äù. The architect of the structure was Mario Emmer while the decorations and interiors of the structure were entrusted to Giovanni Nei Pasinetti. The first flight of an airplane over Venice, a French Farman II, piloted by the car champion Alessandro Umberto Cagno, dates back to 1911 and was the result of an advertising initiative by the Compagnia Italiana Grandi Alberghi to attract and entertain the rich clientele. After that first experience, the aeronautical exhibitions continued and, in the spring of 1914, an advertisement from the H√¥tel Excelsior warned future customers that two seaplanes would be available for their enjoyment. The outbreak of the First World War canceled the initiative. The importance of the lagoon city as a base for military seaplanes was soon understood by the Regia Marina, which on 25 April 1913, the feast of San Marco, baptized the birth of the first seaplane squadron in the world, with the name of San Marco and based at the Arsenale. The piloting school was annexed to the squadron, thus realizing a project proposed since 30 October 1912 by the frigate captain Ludovico de Filippi, patented in Centocelle in 1910 and deputy inspector of the Aeronautical Services of the Ministry of War since 6 April 1911 At first, the school's activity took place in the Vergini canal, near the Arsenale, but shortly afterwards it was transferred to the new seaplane base, built in the canal of the fort of S. Andrea, on the Vignole island, not far away. from the Lido inlet. The school's staff consisted of the S. Marco Squadron, which initially used 8 heterogeneous seaplanes (one Knee hydro, three Borel 100 Hp, one Borel 80 Hp, two Curtiss Paulham 1912 and one Br√©guet). On 26 April 1912 the Caproni aviation school, using a Ca.12, also carried out the first transport of a paying passenger in Italy. At the outbreak of the First World War, Venice was easily exposed to attacks by Austrian bombers, which hit the city from the first day. The Italian and French aviation departments worked effectively in numerous reconnaissance missions, bombing of enemy bases and defense of the city. From 11 March 1918, the Lido also saw the birth of the 1st naval squadron S.A. (or First Air Torpedo Naval Squadron), under the command of the writer and Major Gabriele d'Annunzio, who remained there until autumn 1919. In late spring 1918 the 241st Squadron was also born there. The Regia Marina, in 1918, created the 241st Squadron here, commanded by Lieutenant Luigi Bologna and to which the Lieutenants Giorgio Parodi and Giovanni Ravelli belonged, equipped with at least 9 Hanriot HD.1 and 3 Nieuport 10 and Nieuport 17 for training . After the war, on August 18, 1926, the first Italian scheduled flight took off from the runway of San Nicol√≤ al Lido airport, operated by the Societ√† Anonima Transadriatica company managed by the engineer Renato Morandi; it was directed to Vienna via Klagenfurt and it was operated with three-engine Junkers G 24. The Lido airport, baptized ‚ÄúGiovanni Nicelli‚Äù, thus became the first airport in Italy. The line was extended the following year to Rome- Foligno-Venice-Vienna, again by the Transadriatica Anonymous Society. In 1927 and 1928, the famous aviator Mario de Bernardi achieved the world records in flight speed here, aboard a Macchi M.52 and a Macchi M.52bis. In the 1950s, the airport began its decline; all the companies that operated there moved, first to Treviso (1953), then to the new Tessera airport (1960). In 1974 the Aeronavali Workshops were also moved to Tessera. The airport, for years, remained active only thanks to the local Aeroclub. Its airport is the only one in Italy to have remained unscathed from the bombings of the Second World War and today testifies to the typical architectural style of the 1930s terminals; in it, there is a fresco depicting a map of the overhead lines of the period.  Acknowledgments & Appearances  In 2014 the airport was included in the list of the ten most beautiful in the world drawn up by the BBC by Jonathan Glancey. ‚ÄúSet on the Venice Lido, a few minutes by water taxi from St Mark‚Äôs Square, Nicelli Airport is one of Europe‚Äôs most delightful city airports. It serves second fiddle to the international airport ‚Äì Marco Polo ‚Äì on the other side of the lagoon, yet it is beautifully located and its terminal building is a strikingly handsome design from 1935. Here, the bright arrivals and departure lounge is happily dominated by a grand piano and surrounded by stirring murals of 1930s aircraft by the Futurist artist Tato (Guglielmo Sansoni). Set between the lagoon, a medieval church and other historic buildings, the airport can be reached on foot, bike or boat.‚Äù ‚Äì (Glancey) The airport, an example of perfectly preserved 1930s architecture, begun in 1926 and solemnly inaugurated on February 4, 1935, is the oldest commercial port in Italy. It is also artistic heritage of the Italian Republic. Given the great location, it was also the set of various memorable scenes of the historic tv series ‚ÄúWinds of War‚Äù, 1983.

He was the eldest of six children of Anders Vilhelm Hammar and Elin Christina Hammar (n√©e Olsson). He emigrated to the United States in 1913, attended Bethel University in St. Paul, Minnesota, and by 1920 was married and living with his wife, Louise (with whom he was ultimately to have four children), in King County, Washington. He obtained his M.S. degree at the University of Idaho in 1924 and a Ph.D. from the California Institute of Technology in 1927. His Ph.D. dissertation topic was titled \\"Magnetic Susceptibilities of Some Common Gases.\\" He returned to the University of Idaho in 1926 to teach, and became the head of the physics department in 1930, a position that he held for sixteen years. He led a productive materials science laboratory and was mindful of practical applications of his research--for example, as an extension of his researches in photoelectricity, he and his student Lawrence W. Foskett developed a telephone using light instead of copper wire for transmitting signals. At present, however, Hammar is best remembered for an experiment that was quite outside of his main area of research, the Hammar experiment, a test of the validity of special relativity. In 1946, he joined the Eastman Kodak Company as a senior supervising physicist with the Navy Ordnance Division. During this period with Kodak, he worked on various military projects. He developed infrared photosensitive cells for use in night-vision gun sights, and time-delayed fuses for use in unattended firearms intended to mislead the enemy into believing that large forces of men are concentrated in areas where they actually are not (patents 2547820, 2601135, 2917413, 2958802, 3063862, 3067330).

Purpose  The cross country rail main line from Birmingham to Cardiff, Bristol and the South West passes close to the east of Worcester, however there were no nearby stations on this line, and the cross country trains passed through Worcestershire without stopping. Worcestershire County Council therefore sought for many years to have a station on this line built near Worcester. The station is positioned a mile outside Worcester near the village of Norton, at the point where the cross country line passes under the Cotswold Line from Worcester to Oxford and London. It has two platforms on the former, and one on the latter, allowing interchange between the two lines. It is also close to Junction 7 on the M5, allowing Worcestershire residents to use the station as a 500-car park and ride to major cities, as well as into Worcester's Foregate Street and Shrub Hill stations, which is expected to relieve traffic and parking problems in Worcester itself. Map of railways around Worcester, showing location of station Development Funding An outline business case was developed by Laing Rail in March 2006, which concluded in favour of the development of Worcestershire Parkway Regional Interchange. Worcestershire County Council set aside ¬£3 million for park and ride facilities at the station in 2007.NWM Plans In October 2008 an e-petition was set up on the No 10 website calling for a Worcestershire Parkway. The Third Worcestershire Local Transport Plan (LTP3) cited Worcestershire Parkway Regional Interchange as the top transport priority for Worcestershire.http://www.worcestershire.gov.uk/LTP3 It was also listed in the West Midlands Regional Spatial Strategy as a Sub Regional Priority, and featured in Policy T6 - Strategic Park and Ride. A revised business case was submitted to the Department for Transport's Rail Office, who gave their formal support to the project in 2012. In July 2014 the station was given funding as part of a government infrastructure fund distributed to local enterprise partnerships. Concerns Concerns were raised that the construction of Worcestershire Parkway would lead to reduced services at Worcester Foregate Street. However, this was rejected in 2014 by the deputy leader of Worcestershire County Council, Councillor Simon Geraghty, who said, \\"There has been no risk identified by Network Rail to existing railway stations.\\" Construction CrossCountry Plymouth-Edinburgh and GWR London services passing the proposed station site in 2017 Artist impressions were released in February 2015 and the council said that a planning application had been submitted, with a decision due to have been made during the summer of 2015. The plan was for work to commence by the spring of 2016 and the station was on track to open in summer 2017, the county council said. In February 2015, Worcestershire County Council advertised for contractors for the construction of the railway station to include platforms, station building, passenger footbridge and lifts with a commencement date of late September 2015 with completion in May 2017.\\"Tender Advertisement\\" On 25 August 2015 planning permission was granted, with work expected to start in 2016. The cost of the scheme was estimated at ¬£22m.\\"BBC News\\" A potential legal battle between Worcester County Council and Norton Parkway Developments, who currently own the land, started in 2016. Norton Parkway Developments refused to hand over the land to the council as they felt that they were in a position to complete the development themselves. In January 2017, WCC's plans for Worcestershire Parkway were approved by the DfT. In February 2017, clearance work on the site began, and Worcestershire County Council appointed Buckingham Group Contracting as the developer as part of a design and build deal. Construction work finally began in early 2018, with a planned opening date in 2019. In November 2019, it was announced that the station would open on 15 December 2019. This was later pushed back to an unspecified time \\"early in the New Year.\\" In January 2020, it was announced that the station would be further delayed but opening was expected 'well before' the May timetable change. View of station atrium Phase 1 construction included the Cotswold Line, station building, interchange facilities, 300 space car park, road access and infrastructure for phase 2. This second phase included two new platforms on the Birmingham - Bristol Main Line, a footbridge between the Phase 1 and 2 platforms, and an additional 200 car parking spaces. Worcestershire Parkway opened to the public on Sunday 23 February 2020. The first train to serve the new station was the 8:29 GWR service to London Paddington. At 9:57 the first Train arrived from London Paddington. The first Cross Country service to serve the station was the 10:40 to Cardiff Central from Birmingham New Street. Services The station is served by both Worcester - Oxford/London and all Nottingham - Cardiff trains. The aim is for trains to travel to London in 2 hours or less. Phase 3 of the station's introduction will schedule additional Cross Country trains. Services at Worcestershire Parkway are operated by CrossCountry and Great Western Railway.

Major Frederick Henry Munn commanded the detachment of the Royal Irish Fusiliers at Witpoort which was attacked on 16 July 1900, his orders being to \\"hold his position at all costs\\". The Boers called on Major Munn to surrender, but, scornfully refusing, he held out from daybreak till 2 pm, when the Canadian forces mounted a counterattack and the Boers retired. The battle became famous because of the death of Harold Lothrop Borden.  Context  The Second Boer War was fought from 11 October 1899 until 31 May 1902 between the British Empire and the Afrikaans-speaking Dutch settlers of two independent Boer republics, the South African Republic (Transvaal Republic) and the Orange Free State. It ended with a British victory and the annexation of both republics by the British Empire; both would eventually be incorporated into the Union of South Africa, a dominion of the British Empire, in 1910. In the Battle of Witpoort, British commander Edward Hutton had four companies of the Royal Irish Fusiliers, the 1st Mounted Infantry, which was made up of the 1st and 2nd Canadians (who had arrived in camp on 15 July), as well as the Australians of the Queensland Mounted Infantry. Under the command of Major Munn were three companies of the Royal Irish Fusiliers (or four, according to 'G' Troop) and 60 troopers of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles were placed on the three hills straddling the Witpoort Pass, The British officers were charged by South African Republic General Ben Viljoen and renowned Boer fighter Roland Schikkerling.Roland Schikkerling later authored the book Commando Courageous: (a Boer's Diary).  Battle  Harold Lothrop Borden South African Republic General Ben Viljoen had positioned his troops for attack during the night of 15 July and then launched a three-pronged assault on Major Munn and the Irish positions at daybreak. Viljoen ordered a 'general storming of the British's entrenchments'. The battle opened at 06.45 with heavy shelling on Major Munn's troops. Renowned Boer fighter Roland Schikkerling and his comrades went to the north of the New Zealanders' ridge and then charged under heavy rifle fire. The New Zealanders surrendered one of the three hills they occupied, the Boers were in possession of the higher hill which commanded the lower middle hill. Schikkerling captured a captain and twenty New Zealanders and some continued right over the ridge and captured a number of horses. (Boer Willem Morkel du Toit died in the charge.) The Canadians mounted a counter-attack. Colonel Edwin Alderson sent two squadrons of the Canadians to assist 'the Irish on the kopje which had been vacated by the New Zealanders' and, with the fire from the guns, the position was regained. Lieutenants Borden and John Edgar BurchBURCH - Lieut. John Edgar - Royal Canadian Dragoons Killed at Reit Vlei. 16 July 1900. Memorial at St. catharine's, Niagara, Canada - \\"Lieut. J.

Boer marksmen less than 200 yards distant shot them as they stood up to lead the rifles forward. Lord Roberts reported to the War Office that Borden and Burch \\"were killed while gallantly leading their men in a counter attack upon the enemy's flank at a critical juncture of his assault upon our position.\\" At 14.00, British officer Edward Hutton moved all of his available troops onto the desperately regained positions and, by sundown, the battle of Witpoort had ended. His losses were seven killed, with 30 wounded. Two officers and 22 soldiers had been taken prisoner. The Canadian losses were heavy and included Lt Borden, the son of the Canadian Minister of Defence. He is buried at the Braamfontein Cemetery, not far from the grave of Willem Morkel du Toit. Battle of Witpoort, Harold Lothrop Borden Monument, Canning, Nova Scotia  Legacy  There are very few battlefields of the Anglo-Boer War which present such well preserved traces as does Witpoort with its 51 small two and four man stone breastworks (sangars) built by the New Zealanders. The long line of stone shelters makes it possible for one to stand there and visualise the mad charge made by renowned Boer fighter Roland Schikkerling and his fellow Johannesburgers. There Willem Morkel fell. One can also crouch behind the rocky ridge thirty to forty meters below the sangars and then walk over the ground once swept by the New Zealanders' fire. There Schikkerling took his prisoners. On the south of the ridge Colonel Alderson led his Canadians in their counter-attack toward the captured position. Today, this area is a well tended farm and in the north, the level ground over which the Boers charged is now a wattle plantation. This battle site, with its clearly identifiable sangars, deserves to be declared a Heritage Site under auspices of the new National Heritage Commission.

Premise Film begins the founding of the Koskela croft in the 1880s and tells the story of the life of the people of the imaginary Pentinkulma village until about 1920. The central theme is the unstable position of crofters and their goal to improve their living conditions. The rural upper class, such as the priestly family, and the poor people, whose socio-economic status is weaker than that of crofters, also play an important role. The story of the film goes all the way to the end of the Finnish Civil War between the Red Guards (Crofters) and the Whites (Government).

One stone was recovered by a nomad, and a second stone was recovered in July 2000 by Marc, Luc, and Jim Labenne who were searching for meteorites in the same location. The meteorite was analyzed in 2001.

The meteoric iron is kamacite with 5.77% nickel. Small amounts of other minerals include troilite, Mg-Mn-Fe sulfides and Fe-Cr sulfides. Classification The meteorite was described as an \\"ungrouped stony meteorite\\" in 2000, and reclassified as an \\"ungrouped enstatite meteorite\\" in 2001. In 2006, Itqiy was classified as a member of the EH enstatite chondrites, with a petrologic type of 7, emphasizing that it was a strongly metamorphosed EH chondrite. Itqiy represents a rock that formed through partial melting of an EH chondrite. This process removed the more volatile minerals like plagioclase.

He has held that position since prior to the 2005 season. Daron is the husband of the former Carol Cawood. They have been married since August 6th, 1988. They have two sons: Erik (28) and Bret (17). Erik was selected by the San Diego Padres in the 11th round in the 2013 MLB First Year Player Draft after being named the 2013 Conference USA Pitcher of the Year. Playing career Schoenrock was a pitcher at Tennessee Tech, starting games in all four years before earning his degree in 1984. Coaching career After completing his studies at Tennessee Tech, Schoenrock became a graduate assistant coach for one season at his alma mater. He then moved to Murray State where he completed a master's and served as an assistant for two seasons. Schoenrock then earned his first head coaching position at Division II Lincoln Memorial. He coached for two seasons with the Railsplitters, leading the team to their first postseason appearance in five years and earning conference coach of the year honors in 1989. During that season, Lincoln Memorial played all of their games on the road due to work on their home stadium. Following his stint with LMU, Schoenrock became a pitching coach at Birmingham‚ÄìSouthern, then an NAIA school. In his eight seasons with the Panthers, he became a highly regarded pitching coach, authoring a book on all aspects of pitching, helping the Panthers reach the NAIA College World Series, and earning a summer posting as a short-season pitching coach in the Chicago White Sox organization in 1995. He then began a series of short stints as a pitching coach at Southeastern Conference schools, working two years at Kentucky, two years at Georgia and three years at Mississippi State.

After a rough first year, he led the Tigers to 32 wins in his second season, marking the second best improvement in wins in the nation that year. The Tigers appeared in the 2007 NCAA Tournament and frequently advance to the Conference USA Baseball Tournament under Schoenrock. The team has also performed well in the classroom, posting GPA's well over 3.2 as a team.

It links the towns of Thun, Spiez and Interlaken, running principally along the southern shore of Lake Thun. The line was opened in 1893 by the Lake Thun Railway (, TSB) company, but incorporates much of the earlier B√∂deli Railway () dating back to 1872. The line is long, and is currently owned and operated by the BLS AG railway company. Besides traffic to and from Interlaken, the section of line between Thun and Spiez also carries heavy traffic to and from the L√∂tschberg line.  History  The history of the Lake Thun line is linked to that of the shipping services on Lake Thun and Lake Brienz, which date back to at least 1834, when the first steamship was introduced. The two lakes are linked by a stretch of the Aare through Interlaken, but the river is not navigable, dropping some and passing over several weirs. In 1872, the first part of the B√∂deli Railway was built, from D√§rligen, on Lake Thun, to what is now Interlaken West station. In 1874, it was extended, via what is now Interlaken Ost station, to B√∂nigen, on Lake Brienz. The line was not connected to any other railway, and served to connect the shipping on the two lakes to each other, and to Interlaken. The route of the B√∂deli Railway crosses the Aare twice, using bridges with little headroom beneath them, and it has been suggested that this was done deliberately in order to dissuade attempts to canalise the river and thus maintain the railway's role. From 1873, the B√∂deli Railway also operated a train ferry on Lake Thun, providing a connection for freight to the Bern‚ÄìThun railway line at Thun. In 1890, the Lake Thun Railway company obtained a concession for a railway from Scherzligen in Thun, via Spiez, to an end-on connection with the existing B√∂deli Railway at D√§rligen. This line started operation in 1893, and also leased the B√∂deli Railway between D√§rligen and Interlaken Ost. The B√∂deli Railway was fully incorporated into the Lake Thun Railway company in 1900. In 1901, the Spiez to Frutigen line was opened, which was to become the first stage of the L√∂tschberg line, carrying heavy traffic across the Alps, and transforming the stretch of the Lake Thun line between Thun and Spiez. In 1913, the Lake Thun Railway company was taken over by the Bern-L√∂tschberg-Simplon Railway, which became today's BLS AG. B√∂nigen remained the eastern terminus of the line until 1969, when passenger service was cut back to Interlaken Ost station. However the BLS had built its main workshops alongside the line at B√∂nigen's western edge, and these remain open, along with the track between Interlaken and the workshops. The rest of line was removed, although the site of the lakeside terminus can still be identified.  Route and infrastructure  The long Lake Thun line commences at Thun station, where it makes an end on junction with the Swiss Federal Railways owned Bern to Thun main line, and two other lines owned by the BLS AG; the G√ºrbetal line from Bern via Belp and the Burgdorf‚ÄìThun railway from Burgdorf via Konolfingen. Near the intermediate Spiez station, the Lake Thun line has junctions with two further lines owned by the BLS AG; the Spiez‚ÄìErlenbach‚ÄìZweisimmen line from Zweisimmen and the L√∂tschberg line to Brig. The line terminates just to the east of Interlaken Ost station, where it connects with the metre gauge Br√ºnig line, which operates to Lucerne and is owned by the Zentralbahn, and the Berner Oberland-Bahnen, which operates to Grindelwald and Lauterbrunnen. The Lake Thun line is built to standard gauge and is electrified using the Swiss mainline standard of supplied by overhead line. Between Thun and Spiez the line is double-tracked; from Spiez to Interlaken it is single track with passing loops. Besides traffic to and from Interlaken, the section of line between Thun and Spiez also carries heavy traffic to and from the L√∂tschberg line.

Residents of the small village greet the newly arrived colonist with a barely concealed distaste, but he is in no hurry to make new friends and makes his home far away from people. Horn is dreaming about solitude, because in his previous life behind him he left only disappointment; unrequited love, and failed attempts to make money on the tea trade. Of all the inhabitants of the islands Horn befriends only two, poor lonely wretches just like him; feeble-minded Bekeko and beautiful Esther who is forced to prepare for a wedding with a man she does not love. Horn finds a gold deposit located near a river. Now he wants only one thing ‚Äì to collect as much precious metal as possible, return to the mainland and try to start over. Horn separates itself from Bekeko and refuses Esther's offer to live together. Horn's discourse with the younger Dribb, Esther's fianc√© is followed by a quarrel and exchanged gunshots. Wounded Dribb rides out for help, and soon Horn is forced to face the well- armed squad of people who hate him.

Initially selling only food-based (both fresh groceries and wholesale long-life foods) and other fast-moving consumer goods. The group owns a centralised, in-house distribution network in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zambia and Kenya. Choppies became a listed company on the Botswana Stock Exchange on January 26, and is a constituent of the BSE Domestic Company Index with an approximate market capitalisation of P2.4 billion as at 20 December 2012.\\"Choppies market data from the BSE\\" The company also completed its secondary listing on the Johannesburg stock exchange on 27 May 2015. History Choppies was founded in 1986 with one supermarket named Wayside Supermarket (Proprietary) Limited in Lobatse by the Chopdat family, with a second store opening in 1993. Since 1999, when the company only had two stores, the management team, which included the founding members of Choppies Mr Farouk Ismail (Current Deputy Chairman) and Mr Ramachandaran Ottapathu (Current CEO) (who are both also the major shareholders with each holding 34.2% of the shares), the company executed aggressive growth, consolidating the group into one structure in 2003 (previously franchising under different names) to become the dominant leader in the fast-moving consumer good industry in Botswana. Due to its exponential growth since 1999, demand for the company become listed on the nation's stock market eventually took its toll on the management team and the company became listed on January 26, 2012. The company hired Grant Thornton to manage the administration front of the firm's initial public offering, with 1.2 billion shares being listed at an offer price of BWP 1.15 per share,\\"Results of Choppies IPO\\" with 25% going into the hands of the public. The IPO was the largest on the Botswana Stock Exchange raising P350 million in both the IPO and the private placement, with the shares being oversubscribed by up to 400%.\\"Choppies shares offer 400% oversubscribedpublisher=Mmegi accessdate =24 January 2012\\" Operations The South African operations are executed through a wholly owned subsidiary Choppies Supermarkets SA (Proprietary) Limited, which operates in the Limpopo, North-West and Free State provinces. Distribution and supply Choppies' distribution centres function as a central sourcing for Choppies stores. The company's top 200 products are delivered in bulk to the distribution centres and then distributed from there to the stores. Other products are delivered from the source to the stores directly. Choppies operates two distribution centres in Botswana; one in the International Commerce Park in Gaborone, and the other in Lobatse. A new 10,000m2 South African distribution centre opened in September 2012 in Rustenburg to serve the South African stores. Welldone (Proprietary) Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Choppies Group, is a logistics company that supports the day-to-day operations of the stores. The company has a fleet of 245 commercial vehicles which distributes products to all Group stores. The fleet of vehicles are all branded with the Choppies logo. In 2008 first store in Zeerust, South Africa was opened there by expanding in the north west region. 2014 was the year when the group opened its first distribution centre in Zimbabwe and in the year 2016 the secondary listing was done in the Johannesburg stock exchange. By the end of 2015 Zambian operations began and in early 2016 saw the acquisition of Jwayelani group in Durban, South Africa. Kenyan acquisition of Ulkwala group was also carried out in early 2016. As part of long term growth plan the group opened its first store in Tanzania and Mozambique in 2017. Store types and product ranges The Choppies Group operates hyper stores, super stores and value stores depending on their respective sizes, selling over 45,000 different products. Choppies sells both branded and own-brand products, primarily packaged and long-life foods. All of our stores are located in urban, semi urban and rural areas in sub-saharan Africa, with proximity to residential areas and transport nodes. The group owns 286 quality own brands ranging from food and beverages to cosmetics, clothing and cleaning products. Marketing and branding The company's main competitors include retailers SPAR, Pick N Pay, Woolworths Foods, Shoprite and small local general dealers. The Group has a current market share in Botswana of 30%, according to an independent survey conducted by Briggs and Associates. Even though there are many competitors Choppies has managed to expand to some African countries starting with South Africa where it is in tough competition with its rivals it is still the preferred retailer giving it an upper hand that is why it is able to explore foreign markets. Corporate social responsibility Botswana ‚Ä¢ In partnership with Virgin Active Gaborone, Choppies organised a Wellness Day for staff members to promote health and wellness in the workplace. ‚Ä¢ Together with the Lady Khama Charitable Trust Fund, Choppies donated BWP 1.2 million in groceries to border patrol soldiers and nurses working over the Christmas holidays. ‚Ä¢ Donation of food hampers to Gamodubu Children Home in Gaborone, which cares for over 100 children under the age of 17. ‚Ä¢ Participation in a lunch for Gabane House of Hope, an old age home located in Gabane. Choppies also donated blankets and towels. ‚Ä¢ Organised a lunch for orphans at Childline Botswana on Mother's Day. South Africa ‚Ä¢ Donation of hampers to Women Against Rape. ‚Ä¢ Donation of grocery hampers to a children's community centre . ‚Ä¢ Donation of snack hampers to a children's centre in Boeshoek, North West. Zambia ‚Ä¢ Support to Njovu Community Centre in Chibolya province, which provides education activities and sponsorship for over 200 troubled youth. Zimbabwe ‚Ä¢ Donation of groceries to Ingutsheni Central Hospital in Bulawayo. Criticism Choppies has attracted criticism from the public in the past due to salary discrepancy. Employees such as cashiers and packers claim to earn less than P900 a month, whilst executives such as the CEO and Deputy Chairman earn more than P30 000 000.00 per annum. This has attracted outrage as the company is historically very profitable yet is not rewarding the lower-skilled workers on terms they consider fair to their efforts; in 2011 the Group made over P124 million in after-tax profits, with a dividend in excess of P121 million being paid out to shareholders.

In notation, it is given the symbol D. History and nomenclature The dabbaba is a very old piece, appearing in some very early chess variants, such as Tamerlane chess. The name dabbaba (Arabic: ÿØŸéÿ®ŸéŸëÿßÿ®Ÿéÿ©) means \\"tank (vehicle)\\" in Modern Arabic. In older Arabic, it referred to a type of medieval siege engine designed to shelter men who are digging a hole in enemy fortifications (Latin: vinea). The name has sometimes been translated as \\"war engine\\". The name dabbaba was also used for other pieces in old chess variants, such as one that moved like the modern bishop. Value The dabbaba by itself is not much more powerful than a pawn, but as an additional power to other pieces it is worth about half a knight. Four dabbabas (each covering a different quarter of the chessboard) and a king can easily force checkmate on a bare king. Its value as a piece by itself is severely compromised by its being \\"twice-colourbound\\"‚Äîable to reach only a quarter of the squares on the 8√ó8 chessboard. Combining it with other pieces usually masks this weakness to some extent.

It focuses on agriculture. It was founded in October 2012 through a merger of Barony College, Elmwood College, Oatridge College and the Scottish Agricultural College (SAC). The institution will work towards gaining the status of a university college with degree awarding powers. Until such time, the initialism SRUC is given as the organisation's name to avoid a reference to university college status.SRUC Boards and Committees Remits and Structures document, 2012 SRUC is a registered charity under Scottish law. Degrees are currently awarded by The University of Edinburgh and The University of Glasgow depending on the campus. SRUC students study land-based courses on sites throughout Scotland from further education to PhD level. The organisation's Research Division carries out research in the agriculture and rural sector while the Consulting Division, SAC Consulting, works with more than 12,000 clients in rural businesses and associated industries. The college has six campuses across Scotland while the Consulting arm has 26 offices located both in Scotland and in the north of England, as well as eight veterinary surveillance centres. SRUC's Research Division operates in six research centres, and SRUC also runs eight farms for both research and educational purposes. History Scotland's Rural College's heritage stretches back more than 100 years through smaller institutions which have merged. The current organisation came into being on 1 October 2012 after land-based colleges Barony, Elmwood and Oatridge merged with the Scottish Agricultural College (SAC). Barony College Before it became a college the 300 acre Barony estate had a varied existence. It was an elegant home, a home for the elderly, a wartime army training camp and, up until 1947, a prisoner of war camp. In 1949 Dumfries County Council Education Department purchased the estate with the purpose of turning it into an agricultural school. The Barony Farm School opened in 1953, with a class 46 boys of 14 to 15 years of age. Day release classes in general agriculture and agricultural engineering began 1962, and ten years later the school became the Barony Agricultural College. The 1970s and 1980s saw the range of courses on offer expand to include National Certificates in agriculture, fish farming, forestry, countryside rangers, horticulture, animal care, veterinary nursing and equine studies. By this time most students at the college were studying full-time. A new teaching block complete with a large sports hall, a multigym and a bar was opened in 1992. The new millennium brought massive investment in Animal Care and Veterinary Nursing, an Equine Unit and a Forestry Technology Centre. The Dairy Technology Centre was opened in 2006, complete with a robotic milking system. Elmwood College While Elmwood College did not officially open its doors until 1972, its foundations were laid 20 years earlier holding classes in the local school and cricket club before Fife County Council Education Committee acquired some land and erected a Nissen hut. This was followed by the purchase of the adjacent property of Elmwood House, Gardens and Greenhouses in 1953 for the sum of ¬£2,300. In 1956 the first day release classes in Scotland for agricultural and horticultural apprentices commenced at Elmwood Agricultural Centre. Elmwood College continued to expand during the early 1960s and this culminated in the construction of a new building, completed in 1972. By then Elmwood had also acquired Stratheden Hospital Farm. The College was officially opened in 1972 by Sir Hector Munro. Elmwood is well known for its golf education and construction of the golf course began in 1995 with special attention being given to both the quality of the course and consideration of the local environment. Opened in 1997 the Elmwood course was Geo Certified in 2013; this environmental plaudit is only awarded to courses which prove they are working as sustainable as possible. The Scottish Agricultural College Three agricultural colleges were created in the east, north and west of Scotland around the close of the 19th century. They fulfilled a critical need to transfer the growing scientific knowledge of agricultural issues like soil condition, drainage, use of manures and animal diseases, to farmers and the general public. In 1899 the agricultural department of the Glasgow and West of Scotland Technical College amalgamated with the Scottish Dairy Institute and formed the West of Scotland Agricultural College. Originally based in Glasgow, the organisation began moving to Ayrshire when in 1927 the Auchincruive estate was left to the College by John Hannah of Girvan Mains. The Edinburgh and East of Scotland College of Agriculture was formed in 1901 and grew so rapidly its premises in the city's George Square had to be expanded in 1904. In 1913 they formed a Joint Committee on Research in Animal Breeding with the University of Edinburgh. North of Scotland College of Agriculture (NOSCA) began in 1904 in Aberdeen through grants from ten benefactors including most of the local councils nearby. In 1914 it moved to the Craibstone Estate, which is still a campus today. In 1990 these three major agricultural colleges merged to form the Scottish Agricultural College (SAC). SAC's three main divisions offered research, education and consultancy. Campuses SRUC has six education campuses located throughout Scotland, each offering varied land-based education courses. The Aberdeen Campus is based on Craibstone Estate about outside Aberdeen in the north east of Scotland. As well as halls of residence and a library, the campus also boasts many sporting opportunities. Courses on offer in Aberdeen include agriculture, organic farming and countryside and environmental management. The Ayr campus is shared with students from the University of the West of Scotland. The ¬£81 million facility was opened in September 2011 and was awarded the internationally recognised BREEAM Excellence rating for its environmentally friendly design. As well as student accommodation, the campus has a library and a diverse range of sporting activities, including climbing and horse riding, are available. Courses on offer in Ayr include Agricultural Bioscience and Green Technology. Barony Campus is set in a working estate in Dumfries and Galloway in south west Scotland. As well as the usual student facilities such as library and accommodation, the campus is home to the Scottish Dairy technology Centre and the Scottish Forestry Technology Centre. Courses on offer at Barony include animal care and forestry and arboriculture. The Edinburgh campus is located at the University of Edinburgh's King's Buildings on the south side of the capital. This location allows students to access the university's facilities, both academic and recreational. As well as libraries and cafes the campus also has sporting amenities and is just a ten-minute bus journey from the city centre. Courses on offer in Edinburgh include horticulture, applied animal science and rural resource management. The SRUC also has research facilities at the Bush Estate. SRUC Elmwood is based in Cupar, a small town in Fife approximately nine miles from St Andrews. As well having as a professional golf course, students have the opportunity to play badminton, table tennis and football, or work out in the gym.

History  The Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Novo Theatre opened to public on 25 September 2004. It was previously named Bhashani Novo Theatre. It was made autonomous by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Novo Theatre Bill 2010. The space center was commissioned by the Ministry of Science and Communication Technology of the Government of Bangladesh. Description Built on 5.46 acres of land, its spaces range in size from its 21-meter dome, seating 275 people; to three-meter inflatable and portable domes where people sit on the floor. Design The planetarium was designed by architect Ali Imam. The Planetarium dome simulates Earth and its cool blue sky. This dome-shaped theater was built with the latest equipment, enabling visitors to soar into space as well as experience the thrills of an interplanetary journey in a three-dimensional environment. The curved ceiling represents the sky and shows moving images of planets and stars through projection onto a large-screen dome at an angle of 120 degrees. Features This planetarium features three kinds of exhibits. They Journey to Infinity presents a celestial show of stars, planets and other heavenly bodies in virtual reality. The ai amader Bangladesh features Bangabandhu Sheik Mujibur Rahman's 7 March lecture, while The Grand Canyon describes North America's settlement clan, Garikhad, which existed in The Grand Canyon four thousand years ago. Visitors need not look up in the dome to watch the show. Instead, they feel they are watching space live, with everything around them, presented by 150 projectors. The Planetarium added a new capsule simulator and smart-step floor and 3D video. In 2013 the planetarium added a Nuclear Industrial Information Centre.

In many chess variants, but not in xiangqi, it can leap over intermediate pieces. Movement The alfil jumps two squares diagonally, leaping over any intermediate piece. History and nomenclature The alfil is a very old piece, appearing in some very early chess variants, such as Tamerlane chess and shatranj. The elephant in xiangqi moves like an alfil, but has additional restrictions involving where it can move. The piece was originally called an elephant, and two of its alternate names were hastƒ´n and gƒÅja, two Sanskrit words for elephant. It was probably one of the original chess pieces, appearing in chaturanga and shatranj. However, its original move is uncertain; two possibilities, excluding the current alfil move, are the dabbaba move (jumping two squares orthogonally) and the move of the silver general from shogi. The variant using the dabbaba move eventually died out, but the other variant spread to Burma and Siam, where it became the move for the equivalent pieces in the Burmese (sittuyin) and Thai (makruk) variants of chess. The silver general move was stated by Henry Davidson to resemble the four legs and trunk of an actual elephant. However, H. J. R. Murray in his History of Chess considered the two-square diagonal leap to be the original move, and reasoned that the main reason for the changes that made the alfil and ferz stronger in modern chess during the Renaissance (becoming the bishop and queen, respectively) were that these were originally the weakest pieces in the game (except the pawns). The alfil can only reach one eighth of the squares on the board, while the dabbaba can reach one quarter and the silver general can reach every square on the board. When chess came to Persia from India, the Sanskrit name was translated to pil, and when chess came to the Muslims from Persia, the move had not changed, and then the name changed into Arabic to fil, the already existing cognate to pil which comes from the Akkadian language and ultimately from the Egyptian language. The name thus became fil and then alfil (prefixing the Arabic definite article, al). The names sometimes changed even more when chess eventually reached Europe, but eventually started to refer to the modern bishop rather than the alfil. Although alfil is still the name of the bishop in Spanish and some other European languages, its former name alfil began to be used in chess problems in English to refer exclusively to the original alfil (a (2,2)-leaper). Value The alfil by itself is not much more powerful than a pawn, but as an additional power to other pieces it is worth about half a knight. Eight alfils (each covering a different eighth of the chessboard) and a king can force checkmate on a bare king. Its value as a piece by itself is severely compromised by its being \\"thrice-colourbound\\", only being able to reach an eighth of the squares on the 8√ó8 chessboard; combining it with other pieces usually masks this weakness to some extent.

The ruin is at an altitude of 220m above sea level, and commands a long view down to Kyrenia and the Mediterranean sea. The site is also a museum, which hosts a restaurant and a cafe. The Abbey's refectory now serves as a venue for concerts and lectures. In early summer it is also a venue for a local music festival. Opening hours from June to mid-September are 9am to 7pm; the winter hours are 9am to 1 pm and 2pm to 4:45pm. Opening hours from mid-September to May are 9am to 5pm. There is an admission charge of 15 TL. History The site was formerly named Episcopia or Piscopia, suggesting that it may have served the Bishop of Kyrenia as a residence, and as a place of refuge from Arab raids in the 7th and 8th centuries. The first occupants known to have settled on or near the site were the Canons Regular of the Holy Sepulchre, who had fled Jerusalem after its fall in 1187 to Saladin. The canons had been the custodians of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Aimery de Lusignan founded the monastery, with the first buildings dating to between 1198‚Äì1205. The abbey was consecrated as the Abbey of St. Mary of the Mountain. The White Canons (Norbertines or Premonstratensians) succeeded the founding canons in 1206. Consequently, documents from the 15th and 16th century refer to Bellapais as the \\"White Abbey\\". The common explanation of the modern name Bellapais is that the French name (\\"Abbey of Peace\\") was corrupted after the Italian takeover into \\"Bellapais\\", reinterpreted as \\"Beautiful Land\\". George Francis Hill was unconvinced of both the French and Italian portions of this derivation. The main building as it can be seen today was built during the rule of King Hugh III 1267‚Äì1284. The cloisters and the refectory were constructed during the rule of King Hugh IV between 1324‚Äì1359. Hugh IV lived in the abbey and had apartments constructed for his use. In 1373, the Genoese raided Kyrenia, almost destroying Kyrenia Castle. The Genoese stripped Bellapais of anything that was portable and of any value. By 1489 the Venetians had taken control of Cyprus. By the time of the Venetians, the inhabitants of the Abbey had abandoned the Premonstratensian Rule. Reportedly, canons took wives, and then to keep the business within the family, accepted only their children as novices. Following the Ottoman conquest of Kyrenia and Kyrenia Castle in 1571, the Ottomans expelled the Premonstratensians and gave the abbey to the Greek Orthodox Church of Cyprus, which they appointed as the only legal Christian church on Cyprus. The Church of Cyprus neglected the Abbey, which fell into disrepair. However, the abbey church itself came to serve as the parish church for the village that grew up around it, and whose inhabitants may have used the abbey as a quarry for stone. During the period of British control of Cyprus (1878-1960), the British Army initially took control of Bellapais. In 1878 they cemented the floor of the refectory, which they then used as a hospital. Unfortunately, the soldiers also fired off small arms in the refectory; one may still see bullet holes in the east wall. Then in 1912 George Jeffery, Curator of the Ancient Monuments of Cyprus, undertook repairs of the abbey. Structure Floor plan of the Abbey The abbey consists of a church and a cloister, with most of the monastic buildings surrounding the cloister. In Britain these would normally be built on the south side of the church to shelter the living quarters from the cold air from the north. At Bellapais, the monastic buildings are on the north, probably to be cooler, although occasionally the lay of the land dictated position. The Abbey's main entrance is through a fortified gate on the south side, with a tower that is a later addition, and a forecourt. The gateway replaced an earlier drawbridge. The church, which dates to the 13th century, itself borders the courtyard and is the best preserved part of the complex. The Italian murals on the facade may date to the 15th century. The church has a flat roof and a belfry, with only one surviving bell, above the entrance. The church consists of a nave with two side aisles, a choir and a sacristy. The surviving decorations include an intricately carved pulpit, the bishop's throne, and five chandeliers. It is possible that the graves of several Lusignan kings rest beneath the floor of the church. The forecourt leads to the cloister, which has 18 arches. Under one of the arches on the north side there are two Roman sarcophagi that the canons once used as lavabos. The sarcophagi are one above the other, with the upper one being decorated, and the lower one plain. Water flowed from the upper to the lower, and then out a channel to the cloister garden. Behind the sarcophagi there is a door that leads to the canons' refectory. The door's lintel contains coats of arms of Cyprus, Jerusalem, and the Lusignans. The refectory is Gothic in design and is the finest room in the Abbey. It includes a pulpit that projects from the north wall, six windows on the north wall that illuminate the space, and a rose window on the eastern wall. The room is 30m long and 10m wide, with seven columns that extend from the side walls to support the roof. While the canons ate their meals, a lector in the pulpit would read to them from the scriptures or the lives of the saints. The six windows provide a lovely view across the countryside to the sea. A door on the western wall leads to the kitchen and to a cellar built under the refectory. The rooms between the refectory and the kitchen may once have been the abbey's lavatories. The chapter house is on the eastern side of the cloister, as is the undercroft. The chapter house functioned as the abbey's administrative office, and the undercroft contained workrooms. The chapter house has an interesting Gothic stone carving. The carving depicts a man with a double ladder on his back, a second man between two sirens, a woman reading, two beasts attacking a man, a woman with a rosary, a monkey and a cat in the foliage of a pear tree under which there is a man holding a shield, and a canon wearing a cloak. The column in the center of the chapter house may have come from a Byzantine church. The canons' cells were on a second floor, above the chapter house and the undercroft. There are several stairs from the cloisters. Three give access to the roof. On the south side of the cloister there is a pair of stairs that lead to the abbey's treasury room, which is in the northwest corner of the monastery.

Eventually, Patterson developed a strong reputation for his multiple artistic abilities, including wood carving.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 544. House Patterson arranged for the construction of his house on the upscale North King Street around 1875. Built of brick with a brick foundation, the two-story house includes elements of stone and metal., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2012-12-20. The interior is particularly significant because of elements such as a unique music alcove with decorative panelling, as well as ornate original wood finishing with decorative molding. Preservation A typical neighborhood in northern Xenia after the tornado On 3 April 1974, much of Xenia's near north side was destroyed by one of the worst tornadoes on record. The Patterson House fared better than most; it was severely damaged, but the owner chose to restore it rather than completing the demolition. Two years later, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its historically significant architecture. Another house on North King that survived the tornado, known as the Millen-Schmidt House, is located two blocks to the south; it too was listed on the National Register in 1976.

Threshold is written by Keith Giffen and illustrated by Tom Raney. The series explores the space-oriented side and cosmic mythos of DC Universe.  Publication history  Threshold was announced on October 12, 2012, as part of a \\"Fourth Wave\\" of comics for The New 52. The series spun out of Green Lantern: New Guardians Annual #1 (March 2013), and Blue Beetle #16 (March 2013), picking up on plot threads that were developed. Giffen planned to re- introduce \\"dozens\\" of space-related characters into The New 52, among them: Omega Men, Space Ranger, Lady Styx, Space Cabbie and Star Hawkins. A Larfleeze back-up, drawn by Scott Kolins, ran from issues #1 to #5. Larfleeze would spin-off into a self-titled series after the conclusion of the back-up. A Star Hawkins back-up feature began with issue #6, drawn by Timothy Green II and Joseph Silver. Threshold was cancelled with issue #8.  Plot  In the conclusion of Green Lantern: New Guardians Annual #1 (March 2013), Jediah Caul, previously a deep cover member of the Green Lantern Corps working for the Guardians of the Universe, is captured and forced into The Hunted, with his discharged power ring embedded into his chest. His Green Lantern power battery is collected by the host of The Hunted, Bleeding Adonis. The Hunted is a bounty hunting glimmernet game show taking place on Tolerance, a planet in Lady Styx's sector of space, the Tenebrian Dominion. Those who are labeled as being a threat to the Tenebrian Dominion have a bounty put on their head and are inducted into the game. The series begins with Caul evading capture from hunters and hunt clubs. He is aided by Ember who, with Star Hawkins, was supposed to bring him in to join their resistance forces. Ember is also part of The Hunted. Another Hunted competitor, Stealth, runs into another competitor, Rikane \\"Ric\\" Starr, a former member of the Space Rangers. Starr is revealed to be working with Colonel T'omas T'morra, head of the resistance, to create blind spots for Hunted competitions.Threshold #1 (March 2013) The \\"Crimson Thrust\\" hunt club attempts to ambush Stealth and Starr; however, they evade capture while taking out some of members. Blue Beetle, last seen being captured by Lady Styx's henchmen,Blue Beetle #16 (March 2016) is also dropped into the competition, however, without his scarab armed. Caul later meets up with T'morra and Ember at a bar, where they inform Caul of Beetle's presence, because his residual Green Lantern energy might have an effect on Beetle's Reach armor. Captain K'rot with his team, Sleen and Pig-Iron, are trying to claim Beetle's Scarab. The Scarab activates to protect its unconscious host. During their altercation with Beetle, they run into Caul, which causes the Scarab to go berserk.Threshold #2 (April 2013) Once Caul gets far away enough from Beetle, Jaime Reyes regains control and flies away. Star Hawkins and Ilda, a robot uploaded with the personality and memories of his deceased wife, arrive to cloak Caul and tell him the location of his Green Lantern power battery.Threshold #3 (May 2013) Back at T'morra's bar, Starr and Ember are attempting to convince Stealth to join their crew. T'morra thinks that they could use reverse-propaganda, to turn the tables on the game, because Stealth is one of the longest living contestants in The Hunted. Ember tails Stealth, wanting to be friends and learn from her. Blue Beetle is tracked by another Hunted contestant, a New God named Lonar, who has plans for Beetle. Hawkins informs Caul of his power battery's location‚Äîa pocket dimension inside Bleeding Adonis' palace.Threshold #4 (June 2013) K'rot is hired by an unknown party to steal Caul's battery and relocate it. During their individual attempts to gain access to Adonis, they become aware of each other's presence. K'rot decides to help Caul find his power battery. Ilda sacrifices her current body to keep Caul from getting caught. Meanwhile, Adonis's secretary informs him of Lady Styx' negotiations with a collector, Brainiac, and that Adonis must relocate himself and his possessions. Before Adonis is able to make his exit, K'rot and Caul attempt to ambush Adonis, and gain access to his pocket dimension. However, Brainiac bottles Sh'diki Borough, leaving them trapped inside. Caul convinces Adonis to give him the power battery. After Caul charges his ring, Brainiac's drones attack him. Brainiac is revealed to be K'rot's mysterious benefactor.Threshold #5 (July 2013) Stealth and Ember are outside of the city when it gets bottled. However, Ember gets shot in the head while they're on the move. Caul manages to break the membrane around the bottled city, enlarging himself. He gets into a brief altercation with Brainiac, but Brainiac allows Caul to leave the ship unharmed, not wanting to damage his collection of bottled cities. Caul decides to abandon the others trapped in the city. However, Caul has a change of heart, revealing that he had uploaded Ilda's memory chip into Brainiac's ship. Ilda is able to take control of the ship and then Brainiac. Brainiac quickly takes back control of his body, ejecting both Caul and the bottled city out of his ship. Ilda is later uploaded to a newly ordered body by Hawkins.Threshold #6 (August 2013) In T'morra's bar, it is revealed that Stealth ran off after Ember's apparent death. However, Ember regrows from a tree while having a conversation with T'morra. Hawkins interrupts their chat to discuss Lonar and his team-up with Blue Beetle. Their conversation is disrupted by news alerts about Caul, now utilizing his power ring, re-entering Tolerance airspace. After seeing a crowd cheering for Caul's return, Stealth begins to realize that T'morra's reverse- propaganda tactic might work. Elsewhere, Lonar tells Blue Beetle that he is able to remove the Reach Scarab in return for his help. With Caul's rising popularity as a hero, Adonis plans to exploit him in merchandising for more profit. After deciding to pitch the bottled city into the sun, he has a change of heart and continues on to Tolerance. Upon entering the Tolerance's space sector, he is contacted by Adonis who patches him into a call with Lady Styx. He is allowed safe passage and returns the city back to its location; however, he is unable to enlarge the city back to proper size. He later is teleported elsewhere by Styx.Threshold #7 (September 2013) Stealth finally decides to join T'morra and his reverse-propaganda campaign with Caul; surprised that Ember is still alive after seeing her die, she learns that Ember is actually a plant. Meanwhile, Lonar and Beetle approach the bottled city using cloaking technology. Lonar disables Beetle's cloaking disc, using him as a distraction, while he enters the city and kills Adonis. Lonar picks up Adonis' pocket dimension, and disappears. Later Hawkins, Stealth, and Ember are ambushed by the Crimson Thrust and Lady Styx's soldiers. The barmaid is revealed to have been an actress, with Crimson Thrust all being actors as well.Threshold #8 (November 2013) Caul reappears in an office setting, where he is informed that The Hunted has been cancelled. In the same office, Beetle is sent back to Earth by a producer of the show. T'morra is revealed to have been the showrunner of The Hunted; he had been inserted into the show to advance the plots and keep all of the participants active. After a brawl between the two, T'morra offers Caul a lead role on a new show, Team Cauldron with the rest of his friends and Hunted competitors. Caul agrees to the role, having his power ring re-embedded into his chest. He is granted a meeting with Styx to finalize his new role. However, as soon as Caul materializes at her base, he is killed by multiple gunshots, as planned by T'morra. In a glimmernet commercial, it is shown that T'morra replaces Caul in the proposed new show, with a name change to T'morra Never Comes.  Larfleeze (backup)  Larfleeze kidnaps and enlists Pulsar Stargrave as a scribe for a biography about himself, wanting a book similar to Guardians of the Universe's Book of Oa. Larfleeze begins dictating his history to Stargrave, before his ring receives a news alert about an Orange Lantern; Larfleeze goes to investigate. Upon returning, after realizing someone had played a joke on him, he finds he had been robbed of all of his belongings, including his Orange Lantern Power Battery. After questioning Stargrave, who had been knocked unconscious, about what had transpired, Larfleeze seeks out the Star Rovers. While attempting to negotiate with them, they are attacked by Orange Lantern constructs, which Larfleeze has no apparent control over. The constructs disperse after Larfleeze is hit in the head. After a discussion with Stargrave, the Star Rovers agree to help Larleeze find his belongings, free of charge. The Star Rovers take Larfleeze and Stargrave to a space diner, where they had set up a meeting with Branx Rancor, a treasure hunter. After a brawl about the pricing of Rancor's services, they are attacked by L.E.G.I.O.N.. Larfleeze's constructs act without his control again. The situation calms down and an agreement is reached by all parties involved; however, it is revealed that Sayd is the true mastermind, previously thought dead. Sayd had tampered with Larfleeze's power ring and placed post-hypnotic suggestions into Larfleeze's subconscious, as revenge for enslaving her, causing Larfleeze to destroy all of his belongings without any memory.  Star Hawkins (backup)  Hawkins intends to sell pictures of a political figure in engaging in an extramarital affair. T'morra intervenes, destroying the pictures and hires him to find out the identity of \\"The Legend\\", the first and longest surviving The Hunted competitor, and to bring them in. While investigating, he and Ilda are detained by the Crimson Thrust and told that The Legend wants to meet them. After being escorted to the Legend, it is revealed that The Legend is in fact Lady Styx, the ruler of the Tenebrian Dominion. Ilda initiates a purge protocol, acting as a bomb and distraction for Hawkins to escape. Grabbing a gun from a member of the Crimson Thrust, he escapes. Upon leaving Styx's base, Caul unexpectedly materializes in front of him; out of reflex, Hawkins shoots Caul multiple times.

Its founder is unknown, although a possible founder is one of the sons of King Wen of Zhou. History The Shƒõn state came into being around 1050 BCE. The Chronicle of Zuo, a commentary of the Spring and Autumn period, mentions this state in its writing. But the Shƒõn state's history stretches beyond this period. The same chronicle mentions another ancient Shƒõn state, located in Northern China, which was established before the foundation of the Zhou dynasty. This ancient state may be related to the one founded in the 11th century BCE, but it is unlikely. It is more likely that the state originated as an earldom created during the Zhou dynasty in order to secure peace and order around neighbouring areas. The course of this state's history is vastly unknown. There has been no record of Shƒõn participating in any major events during its history. It was only a small state, and hence may have been viewed as not worthy of regard by writers and historians of the time. However, despite its limited territory, the state managed to survive until the late Spring and Autumn period. There have been several artefacts found which are potentially related to Shƒõn, including evidence of the tenth son of the King Wen of Zhou being the founder of the state. However, various archaeologists have different opinions as to whether the artefacts are genuinely products of the Shƒõn state and whether they truly reveal the founder of Shƒõn. End The exact date of the cessation of the state is unknown. However, it is known that the State of Cai defeated Shƒõn at around 500 BCE before the Battle of Boju. (Some Shƒõn leaders managed to escape to the State of Chu.) The state of Shƒõn never revived, and the name \\"Shƒõn\\" was not used in any other state's name thereafter. Legacy According to the story of Shƒõn Ru√¨ (Ê≤àÊ±≠), during the Warring States period some of the descendants of Shƒõn royals have settled in the State of Yan, and later dispersed to Southern China to the territories of the Baiyue. Note that Shƒõn descendants in Southern China, namely Guangdong and Guangxi, do not carry the surname Shƒõn (Ê≤à), but Xi«én/Sin (ÂÜº). This is because, according to legend, Shƒõn Ru√¨ was suspected of being involved in an assassination plot against the Qin emperor. He therefore had no option but to escape to the Southern territories of China, which a friend from his youth, Zh√†o Tu≈ç, had control over. Zhao Tuo later founded the Nanyue kingdom. Shƒõn Ru√¨ then married a local female Baiyue chieftain. To avoid being detected and to make a new start for his new family clan, Shƒõn Ru√¨ changed his surname to Xi«én/Sin (ÂÜº), a mixture of the characters \\"Ê≤à\\", Shƒõn's surname, and \\"ÂÖà\\", meaning first. Seeing that Shƒõn Ru√¨ has the intention to stay in Nanyue, Zhao Tuo gave he and his descendants GƒÅo li√°ng j√πn (È´òÂáâÈÉ°), modern-day Yangjiang, to govern over. As a result, the surname of Xi«én/Sin is found most commonly in Southern China.

Early life John Charles Bond-Andrews was born in Birkenhead, Cheshire. He was the eldest son of John Stephen Andrews, physician, and Mary Teresa (n√©e Meacock). When he was a boy his mother took him to Europe to be educated in music, he attended the Conservatorium of Music in Leipzig during the Franco-Prussian War. In between his music lessons he occasionally wrote poetry. The house where he was staying with his mother and brother also billeted German soldiers. He studied at the Royal Academy of Music in London and reputedly studied at the Royal Music Academy of Vienna. In 1876 on his return from Europe he gave recitals in Birkenhead and other cities; he was a success as a pianist in London. Career In the 1880s, Bond-Andrews gave minor concerts in the country, which were unsuccessful, and in town, which were successful. He was a music tutor to Lady Louisa Ashburton and other minor notable people of the time, before joining Albert Chevalier in the 1890s. He helped arranged tours with Albert Chevalier and accompanied him on the Ireland 1895 tour. He also acted as conductor for other opera companies while on tour, with the Carl Rosa Opera Company among others. He had taken the popular excerpt \\"My Lady Sleeps\\" from Longfellow's The Spanish Student, and arranged it for voice and string quartet as well as piano and violin or flute obbligato. This music can still be heard today in a private collection. He composed Herne's Oak, produced at Liverpool, October 1887; The Rose of Windsor, Accrington, August 1889; an operetta, A Pair of Lunatics in 1892, Quartet in B-flat, Trio in D minor, pianoforte and strings, and Sonata in G minor, May Pole suite, and many other pieces for pianoforte. In 1895 he arranged and composed music for the first act of The Importance of Being Earnest for a musical event. On 26 May 1896 he performed for the Prince and Princess of Wales at a gala opening of the West wing of the West London Hospital. While riding high on this major success and others, Bond-Andrews was struck down by an illness that ended his life in the spring of 1899. He died in the West London Hospital, and is buried in Fulham Cemetery with his mother, who had died 18 months before. Personal life On 28 May 1881 John Charles Bond-Andrews married Ellen Jane Trusty (1864-1927). They had five children, Joseph, Richard, Mary, Henry and Isabelle. His mother married again in 1874 to Charles deWolfe King, who accompanied Bond-Andrews as a singer at some of the events he attended as a piano player. His half-brother was Otis Carter Formby King (1876-1944), the inventor. He was a member of the Savage Club and the New Lyric Club.

Canby's XIII and XVI corps moved along the eastern shore of Mobile Bay forcing the Confederates back into their defenses. Union forces concentrated first on Spanish Fort, five miles to the north. On March 27, 1865, Canby's forces undertook a siege of Spanish Fort, which consisted of a semi-circular line of five redoubts stretching almost two miles long. The Union had enveloped the fort by April 1, and on April 8 captured it. Most of the Confederate forces, including the remnants of the Monticello Artillery escaped and fled to Mobile.National Park Service battle description, Accessed 27 December 2012, http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/abpp/battles/al005.htm The fall of Fort Blakely on April 9, 1865 signaled to Confederate General Dabney H.

On April 12, 1865, Mobile was declared an open city and the remaining Confederate garrison retreated with the intention of joining the remains of the Army of Tennessee, then in North Carolina. The surrender of the Army of Tennessee to General Sherman on April 26, 1865 prevented that option and surrender of the Mobile garrison soon followed.

Gymnocypris przewalskii (Cyprinidae) on the Tibetan Plateau. Scientific Reports 5, Article 9780. G. przewalskii is a planktivore with a main population that migrates from the lake to rivers to spawn and another that lives its entire life in the nearby Ganzi River. The species is listed as endangered on the China Species Red List due to overfishing and habitat loss, which has led to suspension of its commercial fishery four times since 1989.  Characteristics  A drawing of Gymnocypris przewalskii under the old name Schizopygopsis przewalskii Naked carp reach a maximum length of and are typically at reproductive age. They feed mostly on benthic zooplankton about below the surface, though they also feed on other aquatic invertebrates. They have long, flat bodies and almost no scales except near the anus and shoulder girdle, which gives them their common name. They grow relatively slowly and may take 7‚Äì10 years to reach reproductive size.  Migration  The Qinghai Lake has a salinity of about 14 parts per thousand, meaning that the water is brackish. From April to July adults of the lake population migrate to nearby freshwater streams to spawn. These include the Harge, Goncha, Chang Ji, and Buha rivers. Much like salmon, they seek sandy gravel banks with slower currents to build nests. When fish return to the lake, their electrolyte levels increase quickly to concentrations similar to Lake Qinghai's salinity, while urine flow, metabolic rate, and oxygen consumption all decrease drastically. This is thought to represent the reduced osmoregulatory and metabolic costs of living in Lake Qinghai which make returning after spawning and reproduction advantageous. Young fish are thought to return to the lake after overwintering in their spawning streams. The other population spends its entire life in the nearby Ganzi River and is variously recognized as a separate ecotype or subspecies (G. p. ganzihonensis). Although likely connected to Lake Qinghai in historical times, the low water levels have separated them, effectively isolating the naked barb in this river. The two populations differ in shape and number of gill rakers.

This movement was two-pronged. Col. Porter led one column, comprising his Missouri Cavalry Brigade, out of Pocahontas, Arkansas, to assault Union posts around Hartville, Missouri. When he neared Hartville on January 9, he sent a detachment forward to reconnoiter. It succeeded in capturing the small militia garrison. The same day, Porter moved toward Marshfield. On January 10, some of Porter's men raided other Union installations in the area before making contact with Marmaduke's column east of Marshfield. Marmaduke had received reports of Union troops approaching to surround him and prepared for a confrontation. Early on the morning of January 11 the Confederates under Porter made contact with Union Col. Samuel Merrill 's scouts and skirmishing commenced. Merrill marched his force directly to Hartville where it took a strong defensive position on covered, high ground west of the courthouse. Shelby and Porter's brigades attempted to dislodge Merrill's force, but it was too strongly positioned. Over a four-hour period several Confederate assaults were made, each being repulsed in turn. Eventually Merrill withdrew most of his force. Both sides claimed victory in the Battle of Battle of Hartville. Marmaduke was compelled to make a rapid retreat into Arkansas and then an arduous trek to winter camp.Goman, Frederick W., Up From Arkansas: Marmaduke's First Missouri Raid Including the Battles of Springfield and Hartville, 1999Historical Society of Wright County, Missouri, The Civil War Battle of Hartville and Related Events, 1997Mudd, Joseph A., With Porter In North Missouri, 1904Robinett, Paul M., Marmaduke's Expedition into Missouri: The Battles of Springfield and Hartville, January, 1863, Missouri Historical Review, January 1964 What became of the battery following Marmadukes' First Missouri Expedition is unclear. It is possible that Brown's Battery also participated in General Marmaduke's Second Missouri Expedition. In April 1863, there is a reference to Brown's Battery of Greene's Brigade in a General Order No. 10., issued by General Holmes, which refers to the court martial of one of the battery's soldiers for offences committed in February 1863 when the battery was stationed at Batesville, Arkansas.http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=dul1.ark:/13960/t7xk9457n#page/n1/mode/1up The battery is listed as belonging to Colonel Colton Greene's Missouri Cavalry Brigade of Brigadier General Marmaduke's Missouri Cavalry Division as of May 20, 1863, with the added comment \\"ordered to Little Rock\\".United States.

The battery virtually disappears from the records at that point. Brown's Battery is not mentioned in Marmaduke's report of the raid, however, Marmaduke's report does mention that his force included that eight field pieces and two mountain guns. It is assumed that Collins's battery of Shelby's Brigade had four cannons, and it is likely that Pratt's battery of Carter's Brigade of Texans also had four pieces. That does not account for the two other weapons he reported having on the raid. These could be the two pieces of Brown's Battery attached to Greene's Brigade. The battery is listed as being assigned to Greene's Brigade on May 20, 1863, immediately after the raid. General Marmaduke began his second raid into Missouri from Northeast Arkansas on April 18, 1863.Ponder 1994, p.30. During the raid, he intended to obtain much-needed supplies for his troops, several hundred of whom were unarmed and un-mounted.Bartels 1992, p.132; Maple 1913; Oates 1963; Ponder 1994, p.47; Snider 1956, p.50. Marmaduke organized his division of about 5,000 men into two columns, each made up of two brigades. Colonel George W. Carter led one of the columns, which consisted of a brigade led by Colonel Colton Greene and the other by Carter himself. The second column was led by Colonel Joseph O. Shelby and consisted of Shelby's famous \\"Iron Brigade,\\" commanded by Colonel George W. Thompson, and another brigade commanded by Colonel John Q. Burbridge.Phillips 1956; Ponder 1994, p.24-26. In all, the division had between eight and ten pieces of artillery.Bartels 1992, p.132; Oates 1963; Snider 1956, p.50. Following an unsuccessful attack on the heavily fortified city of Cape Girardeau on April 26, 1863, Marmaduke began a retreat to Arkansas, conducting a rear guard action at the Battle of Chalk Bluff on May on May 1 and May 2, 1863 while he crossed his forces back into Arkansas.Wright, V.C., & Laud Payne, \\"The Battle of Chalk Bluff...\\" Piggott, Arkansas: 1953. Disbanded References to Brown's Battery become very scarce following Marmadukes Second Expedition to Missouri. The May 20, 1863 report of the battery's assignment to Greene's Brigade includes a note that the battery had been ordered to Little Rock. It may be that the battery was ordered to Little Rock to be disbanded. General Holmes issued Special Order No. 23, District of Arkansas, dated April 11, 1863, which appears to have ordered the transfer of 17 members of Brown's Battery who had originally been transferred from Shaler's 27th Arkansas Infantry Regiment to return to their unit.Osborne, Phil \\"Re: Brown's Battery\\", Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 2/27/2013, Accessed 4 March 2013, http://history-sites.com/cgi- bin/bbs62x/arcwmb/webbbs_config.pl?page=1;md=read;id=27927 These men are counted as present on the regiment's muster rolls in for April/May 1863. Six other unit members had been discharged from the service on March 23, 1863. While these figures only account for 23 of the 120 men originally ordered to be transferred to the battery from McBride's Brigade in the summer of 1862, they seem to point to the conclusion that the battery was disbanded in April/May 1863. The unit is not mentioned again in the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies.Osborne, Phil \\"Re: Brown's Battery\\", Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 3/3/2013, Accessed 4 March 2013, http://history-sites.com/cgi- bin/bbs62x/arcwmb/webbbs_config.pl?page=1;md=read;id=27953 See also * Book:Arkansas Confederate Artillery Units * List of Arkansas Civil War Confederate units * Lists of American Civil War Regiments by State * Confederate Units by State * Arkansas in the American Civil War * Arkansas Militia in the Civil War * Notes References * Bartels, Carolyn M.

During his life, he received locutions and visions from St. Th√©r√®se of Lisieux, Jesus Christ, and the Blessed Virgin Mary. He is called \\"The Apostle of Love\\", continuing the teachings of St. Therese of Lisieux's \\"Little Way.\\" He died in a North Vietnam internment camp, and his cause for beatification was opened in 1997 by the Venerable Cardinal Nguyen Van Thuan. Biography  Early childhood (1928-1935)  Born to a devout Catholic family in Ngam Giao, a village in northern Vietnam, Van was baptized under the patronage of St. Joachim. During his childhood, he was joyful and mischievous. As early as the age of 3, he often expressed a desire to become a saint. When his sister Anne-Marie T√™ was born in 1932, his family sent him to live with his aunt, since they considered his excessive displays of affection dangerous for the newborn child. He returned to live with his parents two years later at age six.Short History of Van, Fr. Antonio Boucher, preface by Cardinal Nguyen Van Thuan √âditions Saint-Paul/Les Amis de Van, 2001, pages 15-16 Since Van then wanted to make his First Communion, his pastor allowed him to begin his catechism.Short History of Van, Fr. Antonio Boucher, 2001, page 17 Despite his young age, Van made his First Holy Communion six months later, as he had been well prepared by his mother. On that blessed day, he asked the Lord for two graces: #To keep his heart pure so that he could love Him with all his heart. #To give all men and women a perfect and rock solid faith.  Rectory at Huu-Bang (1935‚Äì1941) Expressing a strong desire to become a priest, in May 1935 his mother took Van to live with Fr. Joseph Nha in the rectory of Huu-Bang, where he would receive special preparation for the priesthood.Short History of Van, Fr. Antonio Boucher, 2001, page 20 Such arrangements were common in Vietnam during that time period, and several other boys lived with Van. But what should have been a time of joy, in fact was a period of great difficulties. As at Ngam Giao, Van had permission to receive Holy Communion every day. This brought about admiration from his comrades, but eventually made some of the adult catechists jealous. One of them, Master Vinh, made his life particularly difficult. He tormented Van severely, allowing him to receiving Holy communion only days when he agreed to be beaten, depriving him of food, and preventing him from reciting his rosary.Short History of Van, Fr. Antonio Boucher, 2001, pages 22-23 The pastor was unaware of all this. Van courageously resisted, attributing his strength to his devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary. \\"Thanks to her\\", he writes, \\"The devil was never able to win.\\" Eventually, the catechist was punished by the pastor for misbehavior and left the rectory.Short History of Van, Fr. Antonio Boucher, 2001, page 25 In 1936, when Van was 8, two typhoons struck the region in quick succession, causing famine and destroying his family's farm. They fell into deep poverty and were unable to financially support his education. He was then forced to become a servant at the rectory, and put to the side his preparation for the priesthood.Short History of Van, Fr. Antonio Boucher, 2001, pages 25-26 The pastor, exploited him as a slave. After Van obtained his primary school education at 12 years old, Fr. Nha definitively stopped his formation.Short History of Van, Fr. Antonio Boucher, 2001, page 28 Due to these severe difficulties, and seeing that he would no longer receive training to become a priest, Van escaped. He wandered around for some time, was temporarily homeless, and eventually was able to return to his family.Short History of Van, Fr. Antonio Boucher, 2001, page 30-33 His time there was also difficult, since they thought that he was guilty of bad behavior, and such rumors had been circulated in the village.Short History of Van, Fr. Antonio Boucher, 2001, pages 34-36 Fr. Nha eventually visited his family, declaring him innocent of any wrong, and Van eventually agreed to return to work at the rectory of Huu-Bang. But this time, he started with the other boys a resistance league to improve the spiritual poverty that had settled there, and encourage each other in the practice of virtue.Short History of Van, Fr. Antonio Boucher, 2001, pages 37-38  Minor seminary (1942-1943) In 1942, at age 13 Van entered the minor seminary of Lan-Song, which was under the responsibility of Dominican friars.Short History of Van, Fr. Antonio Boucher, 2001, page 38 But after only six months of studies, it was closed and occupied by the Japanese military.Short History of Van, Fr. Antonio Boucher, 2001, page 39 Van then continued his studies at the rectory of St. Th√©r√®se's parish in Qang Uy√™n, under Fr. Maillet, a Dominican missionary. In the summer of 1942, it was there that he discovered St. Therese of Lisieux's autobiography, the Story of a Soul, which was a turning point in his spiritual life.Short History of Van, Fr. Antonio Boucher, 2001, page 41 Indeed, Van had felt in his heart for a long time an ardent desire to become a saint, but knew his own weakness. He knew that holiness through harsh penances and exercises would be impossible for him to achieve. St. Therese's book showed him that holiness is possible even for the little ones, and from then on she was his spiritual sister. A short time afterwards, Van recounted having receiving the great grace of having St. Therese appear to him and spoking with him familiarly, and that this occurred on a regular basis for a period. She personally taught him her \\"little way,\\" and asked him to pray for the French, whom he had previously disliked due to their colonisation of Vietnam. Th√©r√®se spoke to him about God, His love, His paternity, and invited him to converse with God as would two friends. She showed him that God, in fact, was interested in the everyday things of our lives. Soon after, Van had a vision of St. Alphonsus Liguori, founder of the Redemptorists, though Van only recognized him later, at first believing that it had been Our Lady of Sorrows.Short History of Van, Fr. Antonio Boucher, 2001, page 44 Upon reading a Redemptorist publication he felt the desire to join the order, and he recounted a little later that St. Therese also encouraged him in this vocation. But the missionary who had been educating him, Fr. Maillet, had plans to send him to a Dominican seminary and was shocked at Van's refusal. This being one of a string of misunderstandings, and thinking that Van was being stubborn and prideful, Fr. Maillet drove him away for the minor seminary in June 1943.Short History of Van, Fr. Antonio Boucher, 2001, page 45-46 He then returned to the rectory of Huu-Bang, before staying briefly with his family.Short History of Van, Fr. Antonio Boucher, 2001, page 46 Redemptorists (1944-1959) In June 1944, Van was accepted at the Redemptorist convent in Hanoi.Short History of Van, Fr. Antonio Boucher, 2001, page 48 He arrived on July 16, but was sent home due to his small size, since the religious brothers had a heavy work load. In effect, though he was only 16 years old, he looked like he was 12.Short History of Van, Fr. Antonio Boucher, 2001, page 52 However, by his prayer and perseverance he was admitted three months later to the community, and became a postulant on October 17, receiving the name Marcel.Short History of Van, Fr. Antonio Boucher, 2001, page 56-59 In his biography, Van indicated that it was during this period that he had his conversations with Jesus.Short History of Van, Fr. Antonio Boucher, 2001, page 59 At the request of the novice master, Van wrote the story of his childhood, as well as his conversations with Jesus, Mary and Therese. After initial difficulties, notably due to his young age and small size, he eventually became an exemplary religious. In July 1954, after the Geneva Accords, Vietnam was split in two. While many Christians were fleeing to seek refuge in South Vietnam, Marcel Van asked to return to the north which had become communist. He was arrested on May 7, 1955, and was tried and sentenced to 15 years hard labor.Short History of Van, Fr. Antonio Boucher, 2001, page 68-69 He spent much of his time in prison ministering to the other prisoners, and was a great source of comfort for many of them. Witnesses described him as being radiant in faith, peace and joy. He died from exhaustion, tuberculosis and beriberi on July 10, 1959 at the age of 31 years.Short History of Van, Fr. Antonio Boucher, 2001, page 70 In December 1949, he had written to his superiors: \\"Who can know the power of love, who can know the sweetness... there will come a day when I will die, but I will die consumed by love\\".  Spirituality Marcel Van‚Äôs spirituality was heavily influenced by St. Therese of Lisieux‚Äôs ‚ÄúLittle Way,‚Äù as well as by St. Alphonsus Liguori, the founder of the Redemptorist order. Of a joyful and playful nature, he is a model of intense faith lived in simplicity, humility and trust in God. Due to the intense trials he went through, he was also deeply united to Jesus‚Äô sacrifice on the cross throughout his life. Like his spiritual sister St. Therese, his life and writings are of great inspiration and comfort to people from all walks of life, from the most learned to the most humble. A religious order located in Argancy, France, \\"Les Missionaires de l‚ÄôAmour de J√©sus\\" (The Missionaries of Jesus‚Äô Love), has been founded based on the spiritualities of Marcel Van and Saint Therese of Lisieux. The Conversations In the foreword to the Conversations, Cardinal Christoph Sch√∂nborn has written on their spiritual and doctrinal value. While he reminds us that it is the Church‚Äôs prerogative to authenticate such happenings, he assures us that: ‚ÄúThe message that little Van transmits to us is of a theological and spiritual accuracy which far surpasses his own intellectual knowledge.‚ÄùConversations, by Marcel Van, preface by Cardinal Christoph Sch√∂born, Amis de Van Editions, 2008, page xxvii Summarizing the general message of the Conversations, he tells us that what is ‚Äúat the heart of little Van‚Äôs experience and message: his unbounded confidence in Him who is Love.‚Äù Conversations, by Marcel Van, preface by Cardinal Christoph Sch√∂born, Amis de Van Editions, 2008, page xxiv Unbaptized children In the Conversations, Marcel Van affirms that Jesus Christ gave some clues as to the solution of the ancient Catholic debate on the topic of unbaptized children: \\"JESUS: Remember this well. When the intelligence of little children is still undeveloped, the same applies to will. Intelligence is used to understand whether a thing is good or bad and the will is used to act in accordance with what the intelligence discerns. These two faculties are essential [700], and it is these essential faculties that little children lack. It is therefore necessary for another will to settle within the hearts of these little children. If this will acts in accordance with good, it is equivalent to the little children acting in this way of their own volition. However, for this will to manifest itself, it must act in accordance with good, with truth itself. If this will acts in a way opposed to good, to truth, it will not produce any effect. You must place your will within the hearts of little children. In this way they will also belong to the Holy Church. Should they come to die before attaining the use of reason, they will nonetheless ascend to Heaven with Me, for they will have your will with them. You have the will to believe everything the Holy Church teaches you to believe, and you also possess the will to love Me. Because of this, the children will share your will and their souls will belong to the Holy Church and to Me in their entirety. These children may know nothing, but within them resides the will of another who knows, and though they may not know, they will understand. Do you understand this, little brother? Offer Me your will and I will put it in the souls of children on earth. Henceforth you can rest assured that all little children already belong to Me. Little brother, this notion of will I have revealed to you was not known until now. Little children were always saved in this manner without man ever realizing it. Come little brother, banish your sadness and be joyful. You are the apostle of children. It was necessary for you to know this. Children saved in this manner are baptized in Love itself. They are allowed to confess their faith in love. This act of love is accomplished by will.\\" Marcel VAN, Colloques, t. 2 des ≈íuvres compl√®tes, Paris, Saint-Paul √âditions Religieuses / Les Amis de VAN, 2006, p. 376-377 (pr√©face du Cardinal Christoph SCH√ñNBORN). Beatification The process of beatification for Marcel Van was opened in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Belley-Ars on March 26, 1997, and the Venerable Cardinal Francis-Xavier Nguyen Van Thuan was the first General Postulator. The current actor for Marcel Van's beatification is the French association \\"Les Amis de Van.\\"http://marcel- van.wix.com/beatification_van# Website in French. Prayer for the beatification of Marcel Van: * \\"Father, infinitely good, You have given to Van the mission of 'changing suffering into joy.' Spurred on by the example of the saints and fortified by the maternal kindness of the Virgin Mary he gave himself over totally to your Love. O Jesus, give us the grace, in following Van‚Äôs example, to walk in your wake, 'always joyful through love,' on this path of offering and simplicity, with an unshakeable confidence in your Love. Holy Spirit, drawn by Van‚Äôs weakness, you have inflamed him with Love. Grant that the Church, we beg you, may one day proclaim his sanctity and grant to us the grace we ask of you through his intercession. Amen\\" Imprimatur, Bourg-en- Bresse, October 7, 2011 Complete works Fr. Antonio Boucher, a French Canadian Redemptorist, was Marcel Van's spiritual director. After Van's death, Fr. Boucher spent 20 years compiling and translating his writings from Vietnamese into French. Since he mastered the Vietnamese language and knew Van intimately, his translation is considered to be of a very high quality. Fr. Boucher wrote about the Conversations: \\"When reading the text, I felt that this very little brother whom Jesus, Mary and Therese guided by the hand, would have a role to play in the Church and in the world. Also, I felt pressured not to lose this treasure that passed through my eyes, through my hands and through my heart. I humbly admit that Br. Marcel taught me more about the spiritual life than I taught him.\\" Marcel Van‚Äôs writings are divided into four volumes: *Autobiography. Which was written in obedience to his novice master and spiritual director. *Conversations. Which were interior conversations that Marcel had with Jesus, Mary and St. Therese. *Correspondence. This includes letters to his spiritual director, to his sister Anne-Marie, superiors, confreres, family and friends. *Other Works.

Service Dismuke's battery probably first became associated with heavy artillery at Columbus, Kentucky in the winter of 1862. While initially serving as the first major Confederate bastion on the Mississippi River, Columbus became untendable when Fort Henry and then Fort Donelson fell to Union forces in early February 1862. Columbus was cut off from rest of the Confederate Army, and faced capture by Union troops advancing overland from the Tennessee River to the Mississippi. To avoid losing the garrison and its equipment, General Beauregard ordered that the position be abandoned as quietly as possible. The process began on February 24, when the first members of the Columbus garrison arrived at Island No. 10. Two days later, its new commander, Brig. Gen. John P. McCown, arrived, and immediately set to work to strengthen the positionDaniel, Larry J. and Lynn N. Bock., Island No. 10: struggle for the Mississippi Valley. University of Alabama Press, 1996. , p. 27. McCown, was able to transform the island and nearby mainland into a formidable obstacle for any fleet attempting to pass. By the middle of March, five batteries containing 24 guns had been built on the shore above the island; 19 guns were in five batteries on the island itself; and the floating battery New Orleans, with nine guns, was moored at the west end of the island.Daniel and Bock, Island No. 10, p. 34; ORA I, v. 8, pp. 144, 182-183.

Union ground forces led by General John Pope, in New Madrid, and Union naval forces led by Admiral Andrew Hull Foote, upstream of the bend, were kept apart by Island No. 10. From the first, they did not agree how to go about conducting the operation. Pope wanted immediate action; Foote hoped to subdue the island by the slow process of bombardment.United States.

As early as March 17, Pope was asking that two or three gunboats run past the Confederate batteries, to enable him to cross the river and trap the entire garrison. Foote demurred, arguing that his boats were not invincible.Daniel and Bock, Island No. 10, p. 70. For the next two weeks, fighting consisted of bombardment of the island at rather long range, mostly conducted by the mortars, and occasionally replied to by the Confederate batteries.Daniel and Bock, Island No. 10, p. 80. On April 4, the Union gunboat Carondelet made her way downstream, and was not discovered until she was abreast of the Confederate Battery No. 2. The batteries opened, but their fire was inaccurate, and Carondelet completed the run unscathed. Two nights later, made a similar run.Walke, Henry, \\"The Western Flotilla at Fort Donelson, Island Number Ten, Fort Pillow, and Memphis,\\" Battles and leaders, pp. 443-445.

The 1st Tennessee Heavy Artillery Regiment was organized at Fort Pillow, Tennessee, on May 10, 1862, composed of ten companies which had previously served as independent batteries. Dismukes' Arkansas Battery was designated as Company B, and Hoadley's Arkansas Battery as Company H. The field grade officers of the regiment were: *Colonel-Andrew Jackson, Jr., *Lieutenant Colonel-Robert Sterling *Major Frederick W. Hoadley. It appears that First Lieutenant George T.

During the siege, Major Hoadley was killed on June 8, 1863, and Major Upton, who succeeded him, had his arm so badly smashed it had to be amputated. The battery, along with the rest of the 1st Tennessee Heavy Artillery regiment was surrendered and paroled as part of Brigadier General John C. Moore's Brigade on July 4, 1863. The 1st Tennessee Heavy Artillery regiment was ordered to parole camp at Demopolis, Alabama; then to Atlanta, Georgia; and from there to Marietta, Georgia. It was declared exchanged December 6, 1863, and ordered to Mobile on December 11, 1863, to the Appalachee Batteries, December 20, 1863. It is unclear how much of Captain Dismuke's battery accompanied the regiment to parole camp. The picture of the battery is pretty murky from 1863 onwards.\\"Howerton, Bryan R. \\"Re: Numbering of Artillery Units\\" Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 20 October 2011, Accessed 21 December 2012, http://history-sites.com/cgi- bin/bbs53x/arcwmb/webbbs_config.pl?noframes;read=24871 General U. S. Grant initially demanded the conditional surrender of the Vicksburg garrison, but faced with the necessity of feeding 30,000 starving Confederates and having the idea that these soldiers might do more harm to the Confederate cause by being released to return home rather than being exchanged as whole units, he relented and allowed for the immediate parole of the unit. According to the Confederate War Department, the Union leaders encouraged the surrendered Confederates to simply return home, rather than being officially paroled and exchanged. The able bodied Confederate soldiers who were released on parole walked out of Vicksburg (they were not allowed to proceed in any military formations) on July 11, 1863. Paroling of these able bodied men was completed in their respective regimental camps inside Vicksburg prior to July 11. Those who were wounded or sick in the various hospitals in Vicksburg were paroled, and were released, as soon as they could leave on their own. July 15/16 is the most common date of these Vicksburg hospital paroles. Some of the most seriously wounded and sick were sent by steamship down the Mississippi River and over to Mobile, Alabama, where they were delivered on parole to Confederate authorities.Simmons, Hugh \\"Re: 46th AL Co. C -- questions re: Demopolis/Vicks\\", Alabama in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 17 April 2004, Accessed 4 June 2012, Confederate commanders designated Enterprise, Mississippi, and Demopolis, Alabama as the rendezvous points (parole camps) for the Vicksburg parolees to report to after they got clear of the last Federal control point at Big Black Bridge. Most of the Arkansas units appeared to have bypassed the established parole camps, and possibly with the support, or at least by the compliancy, of their Union captors, simply crossed the river and returned home. Because so many of the Vicksburg parolees, especially from Arkansas, simply went home, Major General Pemberton requested Confederate President Davis grant the men a thirty to sixty-day furlough.Martin.

Those who went directly home were treated as if they had been home on furlough if they eventually reported into one of these two parole centers. The exchange declaration reports issued by Colonel Robert Ould in Richmond for various units in the Vicksburg and Port Hudson surrenders began in September 1863 based upon men who actually reported into one of the two parole camps. Pemberton eventually coordinated with the Confederate War Department and Confederate General Kirby Smith, commanding the Department of the Trans-Mississippi to have the Arkansas Vicksburg parolee's rendezvous point established at Camden, Arkansas.Howerton, Bryan R. \\"Re: Paroled\\", Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 14 July 2009, Accessed 11 June 2012, http://history-sites.com/cgi- bin/bbs53x/arcwmb/webbbs_config.pl?noframes;read=20383 Fort Morgan Federal efforts to prevent the immediate re-organization of Confederate forces surrendered at Vicksburg met with some success. A final consolidation of the 1st Tennessee Heavy Artillery Regiment was ordered by Maj. Gen. D. H. Maury on February 4, 1864, due to the fact that the men were scattered all over the place after being paroled at Vicksburg. \\"A number of the men, after being furloughed when paroled, joined the cavalry in North Mississippi and West Tennessee, and are now on duty with General Forrest's Command. Every effort to have these men returned to the regiment has failed.\\" It appears that some of Dismukes battery did remain with the 1st Tennessee Heavy Artillery following the Vicksburg Campaign.\\"BATTERY A 1ST TENNESSEE HEAVY ARTILLERY BATTALION\\", Edward G. Gerdes Civil War Page, Accessed 9 February 2013, http://www.couchgenweb.com/civilwar/1stnhvar.html Although regimental reports stated the 1st Tennessee Heavy Artillery was declared exchanged on December 6, 1863, an order from the Adjutant and Inspector General's Office dated February 1, 1864, read: \\"All officers and men of the Vicksburg Capture belonging to the 1st Tennessee Heavy Artillery, who reported for duty at Marietta and whose names were reported by Colonel A. Jackson, are declared exchanged.\\". On February 4, by order of Major General D. H. Maury, commanding the District of the Gulf, the regiment was consolidated into two companies A and B, (third organization). The regiment moved to Fort Morgan, Alabama on April 3, 1864. On August 12, 1864, Brigadier General Asboth, U.S.A., reported: \\"The garrison at Fort Morgan numbers 600 men, 400 from the 1st Alabama Artillery, 200 from the 1st Tennessee Artillery, with General Page in command, and determined to hold the fort till the last man.\\" On August 23, the fort having been reduced to ruins, and further resistance impossible, General Page surrendered. In his report he pays tribute to Colonel Jackson, and to Captains Johnston and Fisher and their men, for their valiant and efficient service. At least three original members of Dismukes' Battery, including First Lieutenant Robert A. Howell were still assigned to the unit when it was surrendered with the garrison of Fort Morgan, Alabama on August 23, 1864. Remnants of the 1st Tennessee Heavy Artillery that escaped captured at Fort Morgan were merged into the Winston's Tennessee Light Artillery under Lt Simon R. Hayman and were captured with the battery during the assault on Fort Blakeley, Alabama, near Mobile on April 9, 1865. Trans-Mississippi It appears that other members of the battery, including Captain Dismukes, probably chose to cross back across the Mississippi River after the fall of Vicksburg, rather than report to the parole camps and be exchanged. Dismukes apparently re-formed his unit in Arkansas. The last reference to this company in the historical record is dated November 19, 1864, when a siege train company, 1st Tennessee Heavy Artillery, under Capt. Paul T.

The date of the military convention between Confederate General Edmund Kirby Smith and Union General Edward Canby for the surrender of the troops and public property in the Trans-Mississippi Department was May 26, 1865, however, it took a while for parole commissioners to be appointed and for public property to be accounted for.

It is based on the classic Remington single-action revolvers of the mid-19th century. Because of its compact size and frame, it is advertised as being ideal for hikers or campers in need of a .22 LR revolver, or \\"kit gun\\". Design In 1974 Ruger patented a transfer bar safety system for their single-action revolvers and discontinued the production of the Bearcat, which was not readily adaptable to the new transfer bar design. In 1993, Ruger brought back the Bearcat as the New Bearcat, now incorporating the transfer bar system. Some time in the early 1980s, Bill Ruger gave an interview to a writer with the Ruger Collector's Association (RCA) and talked about the Bearcat. He said that the Bearcat was the first revolver for which the Ruger engineers developed the transfer bar and that they could easily have made it that way in 1974. They dropped it, Bill said, because of a mistake by the marketing department. When that department sent out the 1974 catalog and order forms to the distributors, they forgot to include the Bearcat. When the orders came back without orders for the Bearcat, they assumed that there was no demand and the dropped it. Today, only old members of the Ruger Collector's Association are aware of the true story of what really happened to the original Bearcat, since that story was published in the Ruger Collectors Journal and is a part of their history. Variants Bearcat 1 issue The original Bearcat featured a fixed Patridge front sight and a square notched rear. It was made with an alloy solid frame and an uncheckered plastic grips that were later replaced with walnut grip. It also features music wire coil springs and a non-fluted engraved cylinder. Bearcat 2 issue The Bearcat 2 issue was marketed in 1971 as an improved version of the original Bearcat, and renamed the Super Bearcat; it featured an all-steel frame rather than an alloy frame. Bearcat 3 issue The Bearcat 3 issue, also known as the New Bearcat, is Ruger's reintroduced model which came out in 1993. It features smooth rosewood grips with a Ruger medallion embedded. The New Bearcat also incorporated Ruger's new transfer bar safety system. It was offered with an additional .22 WMR cylinder, which was recalled by Ruger in April 1994 due to a concern the cylinders were improperly timed.http://www.ruger.com/pdf/newBearcatConvertible.pdf In 2002, Ruger began offering the Bearcat in stainless steel. In 2008, a 50th Anniversary edition was released with gold-filled script and special engravings, with 2,539 units produced. In 2015, Ruger introduced a variant of the Bearcat with adjustable sights, addressing a longstanding criticism of the limitations of the fixed sights.http://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/2015/5/26/ruger-s-new-bearcat/  References  *  External links  * Category:Ruger revolvers Category:Single-action revolvers Category:.22 LR revolvers Category:Weapons and ammunition introduced in 1958 ","title":"Ruger Bearcat"},{"id":"37993497","text":"Angela Hayes may refer to: *Angela Hayes (mixed martial artist) on Tapout *Angela Hayes, character in the 1999 film American Beauty See also *Angela Haynes (born 1984), American former tennis player ","title":"Angela Hayes"},{"id":"37993534","text":"The Z-1 is the first Z prototype suit constructed The Z series is a series of prototype extra-vehicular activity (EVA) space suits being developed in the Advanced Extravehicular Mobility Unit (AEMU) project under NASA's Advanced Exploration Systems (AES) program.

The Z-2 will use higher fidelity boots along with materials that are compatible with a full vacuum environment. The suit is expected to have a mass of . The Z-2 will be designed to interface with NASA's advanced portable life support system, currently under development at the Johnson Space Center. The suit will also be designed to interface with both classical air locks and suit ports. The Z-2 prototype suit was expected to be delivered to NASA by November 2014 with a technology readiness level of 7 but was delayed until spring 2015. Final delivery and testing in a human-rated vacuum chamber and the Neutral Buoyancy Lab is expected in 2018-2019. This is leading up to a human-rated thermal/vacuum chamber test of the suit with its PLSS in 2020. Portable life support system right The Next Generation Life Support (NGLS) project is developing components that are planned to be part of the portable life support system (PLSS). Two of those components are the Variable Oxygen Regulator (VOR) and the Rapid Cycle Amine (RCA) swing bed. The VOR is expected to allow the suit pressure to be adjusted to 84 settings between 0 and 8.4 psid. The current Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) only has two pressure settings. This new capability will enable in-suit decompression sickness treatment and flexibility for interfacing with different vehicles. It also allows EVAs to start at a higher internal pressure to decrease prebreathe time, and then slowly decrease the pressure afterward in order to maximize mobility and minimize crew fatigue. The RCA swing bed removes carbon dioxide (CO2) and controls humidity. The RCA CO2 removal capability is regenerated during EVA by exposure to vacuum, making it superior to previous systems. To remove CO2, the current EMU has to use either a lithium hydroxide (LiOH) canister or a Metal Oxide (Metox) canister. The LiOH canister can only be used once. The Metox canister can be reused post-EVA but to do so takes fourteen hours and requires auxiliary equipment, crew time and significant electricity. RCA is expected to weigh less than current comparable systems.

Colonel Jackson, of the 1st Tennessee Heavy Artillery, reported on the passage of the batteries by enemy boats on the night of April 2, 1863, in which 391 shots were fired by the regiment. During the siege, Major Hoadley was killed on June 8, 1863, and Major Upton, who succeeded him, had his arm so badly smashed it had to be amputated. The battery, along with the rest of the 1st Tennessee Heavy Artillery regiment was surrendered and paroled as part of Brigadier General John C. Moore's Brigade on July 4, 1863. The 1st Tennessee Heavy Artillery regiment was ordered to parole camp at Demopolis, Alabama; then to Atlanta, Georgia; and from there to Marietta, Georgia. It was declared exchanged December 6, 1863, and ordered to Mobile on December 11, 1863, to the Appalachee Batteries, December 20, 1863.

S. Grant initially demanded the conditional surrender of the Vicksburg garrison, but faced with the necessity of feeding 30,000 starving Confederates and having the idea that these soldiers might do more harm to the Confederate cause by being released to return home rather than being exchanged as whole units, he relented and allowed for the immediate parole of the unit. According to the Confederate War Department, the Union leaders encouraged the surrendered Confederates to simply return home, rather than being officially paroled and exchanged. The able bodied Confederate soldiers who were released on parole walked out of Vicksburg (they were not allowed to proceed in any military formations) on July 11, 1863. Paroling of these able bodied men was completed in their respective regimental camps inside Vicksburg prior to July 11. Those who were wounded or sick in the various hospitals in Vicksburg were paroled, and were released, as soon as they could leave on their own. July 15/16 is the most common date of these Vicksburg hospital paroles. Some of the most seriously wounded and sick were sent by steamship down the Mississippi River and over to Mobile, Alabama, where they were delivered on parole to Confederate authorities.Simmons, Hugh \\"Re: 46th AL Co. C -- questions re: Demopolis/Vicks\\", Alabama in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 17 April 2004, Accessed 4 June 2012, Confederate commanders designated Enterprise, Mississippi, and Demopolis, Alabama as the rendezvous points (parole camps) for the Vicksburg parolees to report to after they got clear of the last Federal control point at Big Black Bridge. Most of the Arkansas units appeared to have bypassed the established parole camps, and possibly with the support, or at least by the compliancy, of their Union captors, simply crossed the river and returned home. Because so many of the Vicksburg parolees, especially from Arkansas, simply went home, Major General Pemberton requested Confederate President Davis grant the men a thirty- to sixty-day furlough.Martin.

Those who went directly home were treated as if they had been home on furlough if they eventually reported into one of these two parole centers. The exchange declaration reports issued by Colonel Robert Ould in Richmond for various units in the Vicksburg and Port Hudson surrenders began in September 1863 based upon men who actually reported into one of the two parole camps. Pemberton eventually coordinated with the Confederate War Department and Confederate General Kirby Smith, commanding the Department of the Trans-Mississippi to have the Arkansas Vicksburg parolee's rendezvous point established at Camden, Arkansas.Howerton, Bryan R. \\"Re: Paroled\\", Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 14 July 2009, Accessed 11 June 2012, http://history-sites.com/cgi- bin/bbs53x/arcwmb/webbbs_config.pl?noframes;read=20383 Apparently Captain Parks was one of the Soldiers who chose to lead what men he could assemble back across the Mississippi River to reorganize in Arkansas.

The date of the military convention between Kirby Smith and Union General Edward Canby for the surrender of the troops and public property in the Trans-Mississippi Department was May 26, 1865, however, it took a while for parole commissioners to be appointed and for public property to be accounted for.

It may be performed with both legs bent (Dvi Pada Koundinyasana), or with one leg over the supporting arm, the other leg straight (Eka Pada Koundinyasana). Eka Pada Galavasana (Flying Pigeon Pose) has one leg bent, the foot hooked over the opposite arm under the body.  Etymology and origins  The pose is named after Kaundinya (), an Indian sage, and ƒÅsana () meaning \\"posture\\" or \\"seat\\". The variations for one and two legs include the Sanskrit words for one (ek) or two (dvi), and pada () meaning \\"foot\\". The pose is not described in medieval hatha yoga. It appears in the 20th century among the asanas described by B. K. S. Iyengar in his 1966 book Light on Yoga, and those taught by Pattabhi Jois in Mysore in his Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga. Both Iyengar and Jois were pupils of Krishnamacharya.  Description  Koundinyasana is traditionally entered from tripod headstand, a variant of Sirsasana, but one can also get into the asana from Parsva Bakasana. Get the knee far enough up the triceps of the opposite arm before bending the elbows so that the core is fully engaged and the leg is less likely to slide down, making more work for the arms.  Variations  Eka Pada Koundinyasana has one leg stretched out straight in line with the body. Eka Pada Galavasana (Flying Pigeon Pose) has one leg bent, the foot hooked over the opposite arm under the body. The full pose, Galavasana, has the legs crossed in Padmasana, one knee tucked between the arms.

K. S. Iyengar, made claims for the effects of yoga on specific organs, without adducing any evidence. Iyengar claimed that Koundinyasana massages and \\"tones the abdominal organs\\", helps to eliminate \\"toxins\\" by encouraging movements in the colon, makes the spine more elastic, and strengthens the neck and arms.

On entering, visitors meet two rocky caves with Asian dwarf otters. The zoo also has several aviaries, the recent ones far more impressive than the older, rather dark pheasant farms. Open areas house ungulates, chital deer and llamas. In the old tropical house, there are capuchin monkeys, marmosets, and a terrarium for reptiles including iguanas and snakes.

It is located in Paucartambo Province, region of Cusco, Peru.  Location The rock is located near Queros River, two hours walking from the town of Pilcopata.  Recent studies The petroglyphs that were engraved directly on the monolith have an Amazonian origin. There is also a strange engraving that resembles a key. These petroglyphs can be abstract representations of mythological or cosmological beliefs, made by people that have consumed ayahuasca (yaj√©). It is possible that the engravers were ancestors of Huachipaeri, an indigenous group that live until now in the Kosnipata valley. An interesting characteristic of the Monolith is a little basin possibly of artificial origin. There is the possibility that the basin was used as recipient where the corn was stuffed in order to transform it into a typical Amazonian drink called chicha. Another theory is that the little basin could have been used to purify a baby, submerging him inside the basin full of water.

Web. 17 Nov. 2012. He is best known for his work on the Paleoindian period of the American Southwest and Southeast, and has published some 38 book chapters and journal articles on the subject. Background John Broster was born in 1945, in Tallahassee, Florida. Broster currently lives in the Nashville, Tennessee area with his wife, Diane Gusky. John and Diane have been married for over 30 years. John has had an interest in archaeology all his life, and for this reason Broster has been quoted saying, ‚ÄúMy work is my hobby‚Äù. Academic career Broster began his undergraduate career in Tennessee and attended the George Peabody College of Education and Human Development at Vanderbilt University. He attended the school from 1965 to 1968, and received his B.A. in sociology-anthropology in 1968. Upon completion of his undergraduate degree in the spring of 1968, John enrolled as a graduate student at the University of New Mexico and started there in the fall of 1968. Focusing on paleoindian studies, John spent several years in New Mexico alongside his friend and colleague, Dennis Stanford and completed his master's degree in 1971. John continued his studies at the University of New Mexico until 1973, when he began working for the Tennessee Division of Archaeology. Archaeological career During his undergraduate career, Broster attended several field projects in the Mixteca Alta in the State of Oaxaca, Mexico, which is a site dedicated to understanding Mixteca origins.Andrew, Balkansky. \\"Anthropology Faculty.\\" Anthropology Faculty. Southern Illinois University, 3 Sept. 2011. Web. 17 Nov. 2012. . The field seasons of 1966 and 1967 that John attended consisted of survey work, and he returned two years later in 1970 to participate in excavations. Later on, after completing his M.A. at New Mexico, Lewis Binford had arranged for Broster and other graduate students to attend a field season with Robert WhallonRobert Whallon.\\" Curators. University of Michigan Museum of Anthropology, n.d. Web. 17 Nov. 2012. . at a Mesolithic site in the Netherlands in 1973. In the summer of 1973, Broster took a job with his colleague; Dennis Stanford-who was then working at the Smithsonian Institution. Under Stanford, Broster was involved with the first field season at the Jones-Miller Bison Kill Site in northeast Colorado and participated in some of the first excavations at the site.Cassells, E. Steve. (1997) [1983] The Archaeology of Colorado. Boulder: Johnson Press. . After the Jones-Miller project ended in the summer of 1973, the newly established Tennessee Division of Archaeology, Department of Environment and Conservation hired Broster as the regional archaeologist for Western Tennessee. John worked for the Tennessee Division of Archaeology from 1973-1975. In 1975, Broster left the Tennessee Division of Archaeology and took a job as the project director at the Office of Contract Archaeology (OCA)Office of Contract Archaeology.\\" University of New Mexico. University of New Mexico, n.d. Web. . at the University of New Mexico in 1976-1977. He oversaw numerous excavations and published in several journals at the school. In 1977, Broster left the OCA and was hired by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Forestry Department\\"BIA Website.\\" Bureau Indian Affairs. BIA, 16 Nov. 2012. Web. 17 Nov. 2012. . as the field director in 1978. Broster was later promoted to the archaeological program director, where he oversaw a series of surveys on a multitude of Native American reservations. Some of these surveys included work at the, Jicarilla and Mescalero Apache reservations, and Acoma and Isleta Pueblo reservations. While working for the BIA, John Broster was awarded two consecutive Achievement Awards for his outstanding work as the archaeological program director in 1983 and 1984. Broster worked with the BIA until early 1984. In the latter half of 1984 until early 1985, Broster worked for and helped operate the Cultural Resources Management Company, ‚ÄúSan Juan Basin Archeological Consultants‚Äù, with Stephen Lentz, Bradley Vierra and John Ackland. In 1985, Broster was re-hired by the Tennessee Division of Archaeology, where he remains to this day. Division of Archaeology career Broster served as the Middle Tennessee regional archaeologist for the Tennessee Division of Archaeology and was the prehistoric archaeological supervisor for many years, until his retirement in 2013. It was Broster‚Äôs job, and the responsibility of the division to survey, excavate, and preserve prehistoric and historic sites in Tennessee, as well as research and publish on their findings in popular and scientific formats. Most importantly, it is the goal of the division to maintain public interest in Archaeology in order to encourage public cooperation with site preservation. Broster and his colleagues have practiced a ‚Äúsystematic approach‚ÄùBroster and Norton, 1996. Recent Paleoindian Research in Tennessee. In The Paleoindian and Early Archaic Southeast, edited by D.

Council of South Carolina Professional Archaeologists, Columbia. At sites like the Carson-Conn-Short site and the Johnson site, where there are thousands of artifacts, a systematic approach helps to add information to the bigger picture of southeastern archaeology. Broster and his colleagues have contributed a great deal of information to the University of Tennessee‚Äôs Paleoindian Database of the Americas (PIDBA).Anderson, David G., Dr. \\"The Paleoindian Database of the Americas.\\" The Paleoindian Database of the Americas. University of Tennessee, 15 Mar. 2012. Web. 17 Nov. 2012. . Key sites and excavations During his time with the Tennessee Division of Archaeology, John Broster and his co-workers at the Tennessee Division of Archaeology have conducted fieldwork at many important sites critical to the understanding of Tennessee Prehistory and Paleoindian research in the Southeast. Some of these key sites and excavations include‚Ä¶ *The Carson-Conn-Short Site (40BM190) *The Johnson Site (40DV400) *The Johnson-Hawkins Site (40DV313) *The Sinclair Site (40WY11) *The Puckett Site (40SW228) *The Widemeier Site (40DV09) *The Coats-Hines Site (40WM31) Broster and his colleagues have been heavily involved in archaeological research along the Cumberland River and in the Kentucky Lake Region of Tennessee. Sites examined by Broster in these areas include, the Johnson (40DV400) and the Carson-Conn-Short (40BN190) sites, which according to Broster are ‚Äúprobably two of the most important Clovis sites in the history of southeastern Paleoindian studies‚Äù.Broster, John B., 1993. The Carson-Conn-Short Site (40BN190): An Extensive Clovis Habitation in Benton County, Tennessee. Current Research in the Pleistocene 10:3‚Äì5 In addition, both of these sites seem to support a southern beginning for the fluted clovis point tradition, in that they seem to resemble the tool kit used in the western United States.Bryan, Alan L., 1991.

In: Bonnichsen, Robson and Turnmire, Karen L., Clovis : origins and adaptations. Corvallis, OR: Center for the Study of the First Americans, Oregon State University, pp.1‚Äì13 The artifact concentration of the Carson-Conn-Short site and the Johnson site (40DV400) indicate that these sites may have been Paleoindian base camps, where the knapping of projectile points and other daily activities of hunter-gatherers took place.Broster, John B. and Mark R. Norton 1993 The Carson-Conn-Short Site (40BN190): An Extensive Clovis Habitation in Benton County, Tennessee. Current Research in the Pleistocene 10:3-5 Over 40 hearths were unearthed at the Carson-Conn-Short site, and many were found at the Johnson site as well. These hearths evidence the possibility of base camps proposed by Broster and Norton. At the Johnson site, occupations were preliminarily dated to around 11,700-11,980 B.P. based on radiocarbon samples from Stratum III/IV processed by the University of Texas radiocarbon lab.Barker, Gary and John B. Broster, 1996. The Johnson Site (40Dv400): A Dated Paleoindian and early Archaic occupation in Tennessee's Central Basin. Journal of Alabama Archaeology 42(2):97-153 The standard deviations for these early dates from Johnson are significant, in two cases exceeding 900 years. Other diagnostic artifacts and dated material from features in Stratum III at the Johnson site returned radiocarbon dates of 8000-9000 B.P., suggesting that the early dates from Johnson may be in error. Both the Johnson and Carson-Conn-Short sites proved essential in furthering the study of Paleoindian history of the southeast, and dating of these sites is critical in understanding the origins of Clovis culture, and how and when it spread across the United States. Broster once said that Carson-Conn-Short (40BN190) had been the most rewarding site he has ever worked on. It is thanks in part to Broster and his colleagues that we now know Tennessee was a major focus of Paleoindian settlement. Research and selected publications Though the majority of John Broster‚Äôs archeological career has been based more or less in government office rather than in strict academia, he has produced some 50 publications over the last 40 years. Of these, 38 have been focused on Paleoindian research. Book Chapters ‚Ä¢Broster, John B., and Norton, Mark R. 1992\\\\. Paleoindian Projectile Point and Site Survey in Tennessee: 1988-1992.

The aircraft was initially powered by two Pratt & Whitney JT8D-7A engines, which developed 12,600 pounds of thrust. The plane was delivered to Eastern Air Lines on 26 April the same year. On 27 April 1970, the aircraft was leased to Delta Air Lines, and was returned to Eastern on 23 April 1971.

Also, the configuration of the cabin of the aircraft was changed to 83 seats (8 first- class seats and 75 economy-class seats). The aircraft remained registered as N8901E.

The aircraft was almost 29 years old and had 65,084 flight hours and 69,716 take-off and landing cycles at the time of the crash. The captain of flight 256 was Andr√©s Patac√≥n (39), and the first officer was Luis R√≠os (36). In the cabin there were three flight attendants: Claudia Duarte, Dalia Mora and Zaida Tarazona. On board were 47 passengers, all of whom were Colombians.  Crash  The flight was scheduled to depart at 12:10 but was delayed due to a failure on the previous flight. The flight eventually departed at 18:45. The aircraft climbed to flight level (FL) 310 () at 19:09. During the approach to Cartagena, the air traffic control center in Barranquilla cleared flight 256 to descend to FL 140 () and report when passing FL 200 () at 19:26. The aircraft passed through FL 200 at 19:33. The last radio contact occurred when the flight was cleared further down to . At 19:38, the crew of a Cessna Caravan aircraft, which operating flight 209 from Aerocorales, contacted the controllers. The crew reported that they had seen the lights of a rapidly descending aircraft, followed by an explosion on the ground. The plane impacted with the ground in a marshy lagoon near Mar√≠a La Baja, from Cartagena Airport. The plane exploded on impact and broke into three parts. 51 people were killed: 46 out of the 47 passengers and all 5 crew members. The sole survivor of the crash was a nine-year-old girl. She was flying with her parents and younger brother, who were killed in the crash. The girl broke one of her arms in the accident. She stated that her mother survived the initial impact and pushed her aside into a vegetable pile to shield her away from the fire. The girl was found by one of the local residents who came running to the rescue. She explained that there was looting at the crash site and that one of the looters stole a necklace which was given to her by her father. The looting was later confirmed, and the girl asked that the necklace to be returned to her, but this was unsuccessful.  Investigation  Since the crew of the Cessna reported an explosion, first suspicions arose about a terrorist attack, similar to the bombing of Avianca Flight 203 in 1989. However, investigators determined that the plane exploded when it hit the ground, and no traces of explosives were found. The probable cause of the crash was a wrong setting of the altimeter. Altimeter number 1 indicated on impact. Altimeter number 2 (the first officer's) worked normally, but its lights did not work, and therefore the crew could not compare their readings. Other contributing factors were the lack of radar observation in the area and the flight crew's loss of situational awareness (due to the clear weather relaxing them), as well as the airline's insufficient training of crews in this situation. In addition, it was not possible to determine whether the ground proximity warning system functioned properly, or the crew was unable to respond to it in time, as the cockpit voice recorder was inoperative at the time of the accident.

Early-onset ataxia with ocular motor apraxia and hypoalbuminemia/ataxia with oculomotor apraxia 1. Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology 685 (2010): 21-33. It was first described in 1952 by the American ophthalmologist David Glendenning Cogan.Le Ber, I, Brice, A, D√ºrr, A. New autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias with oculomotor apraxia. Current Neurology and Neuroscience Reports 5.5 (2005): 411-7. People with this condition have difficulty moving their eyes horizontally and moving them quickly. The main difficulty is in saccade initiation, but there is also impaired cancellation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex. Patients have to turn their head in order to compensate for the lack of eye movement initiation in order to follow an object or see objects in their peripheral vision, but they often exceed their target. There is controversy regarding whether OMA should be considered an apraxia, since apraxia is the inability to perform a learned or skilled motor action to command, and saccade initiation is neither a learned nor a skilled action.Galvaez-Jimenez N, Tuite P, Bhatia K, editors. Uncommon Causes of Movement Disorders. New York: Cambridge University Press; 2011:38-40.  Symptoms  * Absence of fast phase nystagmus on horizontal optokinetic testing * Problems in nerve function involved in eye movement control, called neuropathy * Inability to visually follow objects * Head thrusts to compensate for the inability to accomplish voluntary horizontal gaze .  Related developmental problems  Even though OMA is not always associated with developmental issues, children with this condition often have hypotonia, decreased muscle tone, and show developmental delays. Some common delays are seen in speech, reading and motor development  Causes  OMA is a neurological condition. Although some brain imaging studies of people with OMA reveal a normal brain, some MRI studies have revealed unusual appearance of some brain areas, in particular the corpus callosum, cerebellum, and/or fourth ventricle. Oculomotor apraxia can be acquired or congenital. Sometimes no cause is found, in which case it is described as idiopathic A person may be born with the parts of the brain for eye movement control not working, or may manifest poor eye movement control in childhood. If any part of the brain that controls eye movement becomes damaged, then OMA may develop. One of the potential causes is bifrontal hemorrhages. In this case, OMA is associated with bilateral lesions of the frontal eye fields (FEF), located in the caudal middle frontal gyrus. The FEF control voluntary eye movements, including saccades, smooth pursuit and vergence. OMA can also be associated with bilateral hemorrhages in the parietal eye fields (PEF). The PEF surround the posterior, medial segment of the intraparietal sulcus. They have a role in reflexive saccades, and send information to the FEF. Since the FEF and PEF have complementary roles in voluntary and reflexive production of saccades, respectively, and they get inputs from different areas of the brain, only bilateral lesions to both the FEF and PEF will cause persistent OMA. Patients with either bilateral FEF or bilateral PEF damage (but not both FEF and PEF) have been shown to regain at least some voluntary saccadic initiation some time after their hemorrhages. Other causes of OMA include brain tumors and cardiovascular problems,.Chen, J, Thurtell, M. Acquired ocular motor apraxia due to bifrontal haemorrhages.

Gaucher disease with oculomotor apraxia and cardiovascular calcification. Neurology 55 (2000):735-742.  Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia  A subgroup of genetically recessive ataxias associated with OMA has been identified, with an onset during childhood. These are ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 1 (AOA1), ataxia with oculomotor apraxia 2 (AOA2), and ataxia telangiectasia. These are autosomal recessive disorders and the associated gene products are involved in DNA repair. Both horizontal and vertical eye movements are affected in these disorders. Although people with either type may have some mild cognitive problems, such as difficulty with concentration or performing multi-step activities, intellectual function is usually not affected.Criscuolo, C, Chessa, L, Di Giandomenico, S, Mancini, P, Sacc√† F,, Grieco, G, Piane, M, Barbieri, F, De Michele, G, Banfi, S, Pierelli, F, Rizzuto, N, Santorelli, F, Gallosti, L, Filla, A, Casali, C. Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 2: a clinical, pathologic, and genetic study. Neurology 66.8 (2006)):1207-10.  Type 1  Ataxia-oculomotor apraxia type 1 (AOA1) usually has an onset of symptoms during childhood. It is an autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia (ARCA) associated with hypoalbuminemia and hypercholesterolemia. Mutations in the gene APTX, which encodes for aprataxin, have been identified to be responsible for AOA1. Elevated creatine kinase is occasionally present, in addition to a sensorimotor axonal neuropathy, as shown by nerve conduction velocity studies. In addition, MRI studies have shown cerebellar atrophy, mild brainstem atrophy, and, in advanced cases, cortical atrophyTarsy, D. editor. Movement Disorders: a video atlas. New York: Humana Press; 2012:28-29. The aprataxin protein APTX can remove obstructive termini from DNA strand breaks that interfere with DNA repair. APTX is recruited to DNA single-strand breaks by XRCC1 protein, where it functions as a nick sensor to scan the single-strand breaks for 5‚Äô-AMP obstructive termini that are intermediates in failed DNA ligase reactions. The removal of these obstructions allows DNA repair of the break to be completed. It is not yet clear which specific single-strand breaks are the neurodegenerative agents in AOA1 patients that lack functional aprataxin protein. However single-strand breaks with 5‚Äô-AMP termini appear to be the most likely candidate lesion.  Type 2  Ataxia-oculomotor apraxia type 2 (AOA2), also known as spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy type 2,Spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy type 2 Orphanet. Retrieved 28 December 2019 has its onset during adolescence. It is characterized by cerebellar atrophy and peripheral neuropathy. Sufferers of Type 2 have high amounts of another protein called alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and may also have high amounts of the protein creatine phosphokinase (CPK). Mutations in the SETX gene are the cause of the disease. AOA2 shows cerebellar atrophy, loss of Purkinje cells, and demyelination. In particular, there is a failure of the cerebrocerebellar circuit in AOA2 that has been shown to be responsible for the weaker coordination of complex cognitive functions such as working memory, executive functions, speech, and sequence learning. Although there is no sign of mental retardation or severe dementia, even after long disease duration, research on families with possible AOA2 have shown mild cognitive impairment as indexed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale. These impairments appear to be mostly due to a deficit in initiation and concept subtests,.Kliv√©nyi, P, Nemeth, D, Sefcsik, T, Janacsek, K, Hoffmann, I, Haden, G, Londe, Z, Vecsei, L.

Telangiectasias are associated with multiple systemic signs, the most serious of which are unusual sensitivity to ionizing radiation, excessive chromosomal breakage, and a deficiency in the immune system. Ataxia telangiectasia results from defects in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated gene, which can cause abnormal cell death in various places of the body, including brain areas related to coordinated movement of the eyes.

The icon represents Vishnu as the Supreme Being. He has a human head, a lion head, a boar head and a demonic head. Sometimes, even three- headed aspects of Vishnu where the demonic rear head is dropped are considered to represent Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. Though iconographical treatises describe him to eight-armed, he is often depicted with four. Generally, Vaikuntha Chaturmurti is shown standing but sometimes he is depicted seated on his vahana (mount) Garuda. The concept of a four-headed Vishnu first appears in the Hindu epic Mahabharata, but the complete iconography was first found in a 5th-century Pancharatra text. The icon reflects influences from the Gupta period and the Gandhara architectural tradition. While as per one interpretation, the animal heads represent Vishnu's avatar Narasimha (lion- headed man) and Varaha (boar), another theory based on Pancharatra texts relates the four heads to the Chaturvyuha: VƒÅsudeva (Krishna), Sa·πÉkar·π£a·πáa (Balarama), Pradyumna and Aniruddha ‚Äì four vyuhas (manifestations) of Vishnu. A cult centered on Vaikuntha Chaturmurti developed in Kashmir in the 8‚Äì12th century, when the deity also enjoyed royal patronage in the region. The Lakshmana Temple of Khajuraho suggests his worship in the Chandela kingdom (Central India) in the 10th century. Names The icon is known by various names: Vaikuntha, Vaikunthanatha (\\"Lord of Vaikuntha\\"), Chaturmurti (\\"four- fold representation\\"), Chaturanana (\\"four-faced\\"), Para Vasudeva Narayana, Vishnu Chaturmurti, Vishnu Chaturanana and Vaikuntha Chaturmukhi (\\"four-faced Vaikuntha\\"). The Vishnudharmottara Purana calls him Vishnu-Vaikuntha.Gail p. 300 The icon may be called Chaturvyuha (\\"having four vyuhas\\"), when identified with the four manifestations or vyuhas of Vishnu.Chaturmurti or Chaturvyuha. (2002). In Dictionary of Hindu Lore and Legend, Thames & Hudson. Retrieved from http://www.credoreference.com/entry/thhll/chaturmurti_or_chaturvyuha Vaikuntha generally refers to Vishnu's abode, but in the Mahabharata and the Puranas, this term is also used as an epithet of Vishnu.Gail p. 305 Though no clear etymology of vaikuntha exists, the term is believed to be derived from vi-kuntha, literally meaning \\"not blunt\\". The earliest scriptures like the Vedas, Upanishads and Brahmanas connect the epithet to Indra, the king of the gods and the Supreme god of the era. By the time of the Mahabharata, Vishnu gained the role of Indra and the epithet vaikuntha was transferred to him. The use of vaikuntha in the name also suggests that the form represents the Para (Ultimate Reality) form of Vishnu.Desai pp. 37‚Äì8 The name Chaturmurti also appears in the Vishnu sahasranama (thousand names of Vishnu). Iconography The Pancharatra text Jayakhya-Samhita mentions that Vaikuntha Chaturmurti has four faces: Vaikuntha, Narasimha, Varaha and Kapila and four arms holding the usual attributes of Vishnu: shankha (conch), chakra, gada (mace) and padma (lotus). In the Vishnudharmottara Purana, Vaikuntha Chaturmurti is described as having eight arms and four faces, human (nara ‚Äì human or saumya ‚Äì mild or purusha ‚Äì man) facing the East (front), lion (Narasimha ‚Äì the lion-headed avatar of Vishnu) on the South (his right head, left), boar (Varaha ‚Äì the boar avatar of Vishnu) on the North (his left head, right) and demonic (kapila or raudra ‚Äì fierce/wrathful or rakshasa ‚Äì demon) facing the west (rear).Gail pp. 297‚Äì300, 306 In one of earliest Vaikuntha Chaturmurti images dating from the Gupta era ‚Äì c. 6th century (now housed in Mathura Museum), the positions of the boar and lion heads are reversed, though this is a rare aberration.Desai p. 41 The central front face may be smiling. Sometimes, the back face may be omitted. The fourth head may be replaced by a horse (Hayagriva, another avatar of Vishnu) or a Chakrapurusha (the personified Sudarshana Chakra ‚Äì the discus weapon of Vishnu).Gail pp. 297‚Äì300 The kapila head may have a moustache, bulging large eyes, a third eye, grinning teeth, fangs, a short chin, broad eyebrows and a ferocious, grim or sad expression. His hair are generally tied up in a large knot ‚Äì a jata (matted hair) like a sage; rarely he may wear a crown. Four-armed, four-headed Vishnu Vaikuntha Chaturmurti, Kashmir, 9th century CE The name of the fourth head as Kapila is interpreted in two ways. Taking the literal meaning of kapila as red, it is interpreted as meaning fierce or angry. The epithet kapila is associated with the fire god Agni and the solar deity Surya in early canonical texts.Desai pp. 39‚Äì40 Another theory relates to Vishnu's sage avatar and founder of Samkhya philosophy, Kapila, who is described as having a wrathful nature and cursing the sons of Sagara to turn into ashes for insulting him. The head-dress jatajuta is typical of Brahmin sages like Kapila. The Agni Purana also describes the icon having four heads, without describing the nature of each. The iconographical treatises Aparajitapriccha and the Rupamandana mention that the fourth head is Shri (Lakshmi ‚Äì the wife of Vishnu) and Stri (female) respectively, however no sculptures with a fourth female head have been discovered. The back face may be carved on the halo behind the central three heads in low relief or in a space between the halo. In the iconography of Kashmir, during the 8th and 9th centuries, the gods of Hindu Trimurti ‚Äì Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva ‚Äì each are depicted with three heads. In a sculpture displayed in the Metropolitan Art Museum of New York, the four-headed Brahma as well as Shiva are shown with three visible heads. Vishnu is depicted as Vaikuntha Chaturmurti in this configuration, with three visible heads. Lakshmi-Vaikuntha riding his vehicle (vahana) Garuda, 11th century Kashmir Vaikuntha Chaturmurti is generally depicted standing. He wears rich clothes (generally in sculpture, only a dhoti) as well as various ornaments like a crown, armbands, necklaces etc., symbolic of royalty and the yagnopavita (sacred thread). In his eight arms, he is prescribed in the texts to carry gada (mace), sword, arrow and the Sudarshana Chakra in his left hands and shankha (conch), shield, bow and lotus in his right hands. However, in sculpture, he is often four-armedGail p. 306 and in two of his hands, he holds a lotus and a conch, while his other hands rest on the heads of his personified weapons (ayudhapurusha) ‚Äì Gadadevi or Gadanari (gada as a female) on his right and Chakrapurusha on his left, who stand as small figures besides his legs. They both look upwards towards him and hold fly whisks. A tiny figurine of the earth goddess Prithvi (who associated with Varaha and Vishnu as his consort) rises from the pedestal in between his feet, as though supporting the deity. A short dagger or sword may be tucked up in the waist belt of the god near the right hip, a peculiar feature of Kashmir icons. Attendants or devotees may be also shown besides or below Vishnu.Vishnu as Vaikuntha, 10th century The Norton Simon Foundation Sometimes, Brahma and Shiva and the ten avatars of Vishnu may be depicted in the background. As prescribed in the Jayakhya-Samhita, Vaikuntha Chaturmurti may be depicted as riding his vehicle (vahana) Garuda too, though these images are rarer. In this configuration, the god holds a sword, a lotus, a mace or a conch and the chakra. Generally, on four feathers of Garuda sit four female figures, two on either side of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. The identity of the female figures is uncertain. They are interpreted as two goddesses (possibly consorts of Vishnu ‚Äì Lakshmi and Bhumi) and two female attendants.Desai pp. 42‚Äì3 The Jayakhya-Samhita mentions that four goddesses Lakshmi, Kirti, Jaya and Maya as the female counterparts of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. Rarely, Vaikuntha Chaturmurti is accompanied with his consort Lakshmi, who sits on his left thigh. This form is called Lakshmi Vaikuntha in the Jayakhya- Samhita.Desai p. 43 In rare instances, true to the textual descriptions, Vaikuntha Chaturmurti is depicted as eight-armed. Examples of these exist in Kandariya Mahadeva Temple, Khajuraho; Siddhanatha Mahadeva Temple, Sandera, Gujarat and Jhalawar Museum. A ten-armed Vaikuntha Chaturmurti is found at Sasbahu temple, Nagda. A twelve armed Vaikuntha image is categorized as a different form called Ananta by iconographical treatises; an illustration of the same is found at Lakshana Devi temple, Brahmaur, Chamba. This form is also identified with the Vishvarupa form of Vishnu. Another variant of Vaikuntha image is sixteen-armed and is called Trailokyamohana.Desai pp. 44‚Äì5 There are some sculptures that synthesize Vaikuntha form with other forms of Vishnu. An 1170 CE sculpture at Chamba depicts Seshasayi Vishnu (Vishnu reclining on the serpent Shesha) with the three heads of Vaikuntha form. Another sculpture in Markula Devi Temple, Udaipur combines Trivikrama (another avatar of Vishnu) with Vaikuntha's three heads.Desai p. 44 Development and symbolism Vaikuntha Chaturmurti first appears in the Mahabharata, where he is known as Murtichatushtaya. Besides the four faces, no details of his iconography are found though.Desai p. 39 The Jayakhya-Samhita, generally dated to the Gupta period (c. 5th century CE), is the first iconographical reference to Vaikuntha Chaturmurti.Gail pp. 305‚Äì6 Though three-faced Vishnu images from the Mathura school exist from the Gupta period, not a single four-faced Vaikuntha Chaturmurti from this era has been found until this day. It is suggested by scholars that the three-faced Vishnu images should be considered as Vaikuntha Chaturmurti too, where the fourth head was dropped by sculptors just for sake of convenience. An alternate theory dates Jayakhya-Samhita to c. 600‚Äì850 CE and suggests that the three-faced Vishnu images of Gupta era as well as Gupta icons of Vishvarupa (another form of Vishnu) inspired the iconography of the Vaikuntha Chaturmurti, which developed in Kashmir in the 8th century and attached the fourth head on the back of the older icon of a three-faced Vishnu. Though popular in Kashmir, the four-headed icon is rarely seen outside of it. The iconography of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti was influenced by Gandhara architectural tradition, which impacted the iconographic depictions of sculptures of Northwest India, particularly those made in Kashmir. Keeping with the Gandhara style, the body and legs are depicted as strong and sturdy. The muscular body is considered to be inflated with prana (life-breath), an Indian concept. The bow arched eyebrows and lotus shaped eyes are also characteristic of the Indian school of sculpture. The presence of the earth goddess at the feet also reflects Central Asian influence. The ayudhapurushas in the icon may be inspired by those in the Vishnu iconography of Gupta art. They and the earth goddess are also part of traditional Vishnu iconography, even when he is depicted as one-headed. The central Vishnu head and side heads of Varaha and Narasimha may be influenced by other configurations in architecture. For example, Vishnu, Varaha and Narasimha may be depicted on back (western) and side (northern/southern) walls of temples. Varaha (rescues the earth from the cosmic waters at the beginning of an eon), Vishnu (as a human) and Narasimha (destroying a demon) may represent creation, preservation and destruction ‚Äì the three functions in the Hindu universe.Gail pp. 300, 305 Vaikuntha Chaturmurti represents Vishnu as the Supreme Being, Creator of the Universe. Also, Varaha and Narasimha are oldest in antiquity (avatars Matsya and Kurma which are described in sacred texts to be appearing before Varaha and Narasimha were associated with Vishnu at a later date). Their presence in the iconography of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti suggests that this form originated in the Gupta era, where their cults were at their peak. Many writers associate the boar and lion heads to the avatars Varaha and Narasimha, others associate with the Chaturvyuhas, however the latter is heavily disputed.Gail pp. 297‚Äì9, 305‚Äì6 The Vishnudharmottara Purana describes the Chaturvyuhas ‚Äì VƒÅsudeva (Krishna), Samkarshana (Balarama), Pradyumna, Aniruddha ‚Äì four manifestations of Vishnu. Though the text does not explicitly equate the two forms. Many modern indologists as well as Pancharatra followers associate both of them based on the association of Chaturvyuhas with gunas (qualities) in the Vishnudharmottara Purana and the Pancharatra texts. The gunas are in turn associated with Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. The human face is Vasudeva, who symbolizes strength/power (bala); the lion is Samkarshana, who is knowledge/wisdom (jnana) personified; the demonic form is Pradyumna, who is prosperity/sovereignty (aishvarya) and the boar is Aniruddha, the Lord of energy (shakti). Worship Vaikuntha Chaturmurti as the central icon in Lakshmana Temple, Khajuraho The presence of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti found in Kashmir and north West India predating 10th century suggests the worship of Vishnu in this form in the era. The form developed a cult between 8th to 10th century CE. The 12th century chronicle Rajatarangini also mentions about the installation of this form of Vishnu. The icon received royal patronage from King Avantivarman, the founder of Utpala dynasty (reign: 855‚Äì883 CE); temples built in his reign often depict Vaikuntha Chaturmurti.Desai p. 47 Vaikuntha Chaturmurti became the tutelary deity of the Karkotas and Utpala dynasties of Kashmir. It was also popular in the regions adjoining Kashmir. The Lakshmana Temple of Khajuraho is dedicated to Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. Though three-faced, an inscription in the temple suggests that it should be considered four-faced. It also records a legend where Kapila and other demons conjoined together in a single form and were blessed by Brahma that only someone in the same form could slay them so Vishnu took the form of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti.ASI The presence of the Lakshamana Temple in Khajuraho suggests worship in the Chandela kingdom in the 10th century. The Trailokyamohana form of Vishnu was worshipped in Gujarat between 12th to 15th century CE.Desai p. 45 Notes References * * Category:Forms of Vishnu ","title":"Vaikuntha Chaturmurti"},{"id":"37993921","text":"Friedrich P√ºtzer Friedrich P√ºtzer (25 July 1871 ‚Äì 31 January 1922) was a German architect and urban planner.

He currently owns and operates four labels: Leftroom, Leftroom Limited, Leftout, and Is This, and he is a prominent international DJ/producer; most recently securing a spot on Resident Advisor's Top 100 DJ Poll for 2011 and 2012. Career Matt Tolfrey was born in England but raised on the small island country of Bahrain. At age 16, Tolfrey returned to the UK earning a slot playing in a Worcester bar honing his mixing skills in the company of a live audience. Later Tolfrey started at Nottingham Trent University, where in his first year he was given a show on the Nottingham radio station, Fly FM. Since the shows inception three years ago, 'Junk Funk' has gone on to win the station's best newcomer award and has seen Tolfrey promoted to head of night- time DJs. Mirroring his success on the airwaves, Tolfrey also began gaining popularity around the clubscene. 2002 saw Tolfrey gain increased support from local independent record shop Funky Monkey, and also from underground club The Bomb who have been instrumental in organising exclusive guest slots from top name DJs such as Craig Richards, Jay Tripwire and Dave Congreve. Tolfrey soon acquired residencies at notable clubs The Bomb, Stealth, and also became the youngest DJ to ever play at Fabric on a Saturday. Wanting to be involved more in the other aspects of dance music, Tolfrey dived into production work. Beginning his work through the moniker Out-ed, Tolfrey gained success through his initial releases and was later invited by reputable label, Crosstown Rebels for production releases. Through his enthusiasm for electronic music and interest in experimentation, Tolfrey started his own label, Leftroom in 2005. Tolfrey sought after an avenue to release his peer's music and open up opportunities for friends that he believed in. The first release was entitled The Extended Family EP encapsulating the spirit of Leftroom, a place where a core set of artists could grow and experiment with their sound. After remarkable success with the first few releases and securing a home-grown and exceptional roster Tolfrey was asked to commence a label night at T Bar, London's hub of creativity in the house and techno scene. Expanding on the idea of Leftroom, Tolfrey put forth two sub-labels to the Leftroom family: Leftroom Limited has the purpose of releasing peak-time records while Leftout is a home for lesser known artists who deserve some attention. In 2012 Matt Tolfrey put out his first full-length album Word of Mouth on Leftroom Records. 'Word of Mouth' has since gained popular reviews from many highly respected electronic music enthusiasts.

It was built by architect Thomas Verity in Neo- Byzantine style for the partnership Spiers and Pond, which opened it in 1873. Apart from fine dining facilities it has a bar. It is a Grade II* listed building and is in the Top 10 most historic and oldest restaurants in the world. In the first Sherlock Holmes story, A Study in Scarlet, Dr. Watson is told of his prospective roommate after he meets a friend at the Criterion. History Criterion building with restaurant and theatre in 1873 Criterion Restaurant, Piccadilly Circus, 26 October 1902 In 1870 the building agreement for Nos. 219‚Äì221 (consec.) Piccadilly and Nos. 8‚Äì9 Jermyn Street was purchased by Messrs. Spiers and Pond, a firm of wine merchants and caterers, who held a limited architectural competition for designs for a large restaurant and tavern with ancillary public rooms. The competition was won by architect Thomas Verity. Building work began in the summer of 1871, and was completed in 1873 at a total cost of over ¬£80,000 (¬£8 million adjusted for inflation). The contractors included Messrs. Hill, Keddell and Waldram and Messrs. George Smith and Company. It was designed by Thomas Verity as a five-level complex with its Marble Hall and Long Bar on the ground floor; dining rooms on the first and second floors; a ballroom on the third floor and a theatre in the basement. It also had an American Bar, which some view as the first American- style cocktail bar in London. The interiors of the new building were extensively decorated with ornamental tile-work, one of the first examples of the use of this material on such a scale following its successful use in the recently completed refreshment rooms at the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum). The restaurant was opened on 17 November 1873. The new venture proved very profitable within a short time. The East Room was popular with ladies who had come to London's West End to shop. Royal College of Science Dinner at Criterion, 9 December 1908 The restaurant was a setting for many events and celebrations such as at the Royal College of Science's First Annual Dinner. The Chairman that night was H. G. Wells, the pioneer of science fiction. H. G. Wells was a regular diner at the restaurant. The Criterion was frequently used for luncheon clubs in the early 1920s. Members met for lunch every Thursday at 1pm and the price of lunch was 4s-6d. The first recorded lunch meeting was held on 6 December 1923. The speaker was a member, Miss Joyce Partridge, FRCS, surgeon and lecturer on anatomy. The list of guest speakers was impressive and varied, including Edgar Wallace, Sir Hugh Walpole, G. K. Chesterton and Bertrand Russell. Suffragettes at the Criterion Kate Frye diary In April 1909 the Criterion Restaurant, renowned for its afternoon tea and in particular high standard of ladies cloakrooms, was a setting for many afternoon tea meetings organised and held by the WSPU and Christabel Pankhurst as a part of Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom. Kate Frye, who was a member of the Actresses' Franchise League, would frequently attend and make diary entries on some of those Criterion meetings. David Lloyd George and Winston Churchill In 1919, the Coalition government of David Lloyd George appeared to be in a position of overwhelming strength and public support. Lloyd George's personal reputation was known to be as the \\"man who won the war\\". Yet the government faced serious problems notably in the economy and with industrial unrest. More problematic was the stability of the Coalition as a governing platform. Lloyd George was aware that a purely personal ascendancy was unlikely to be enough for turning the Coalition into a long term political force. The only ways in which the wartime spirit of national unity could be perpetuated was by appealing to the ‚Äòhigher unity‚Äô of coalition, with the creation of a single ‚Äòfused‚Äô party to reflect the ‚Äòfusion‚Äô taking place at parliamentary and programme level. Between July 1919 and March 1920 Lloyd George and his associates worked hard to bring the fusion project to fruition. Winston Churchill set the tone on 15 July with a speech to the New Members‚Äô Group at the Criterion Restaurant in London. Architecture Front entrance with ionic half-columns and draped female figures. The Criterion Restaurant's front may still be regarded as the best surviving work of Thomas Verity, a leading theatre architect of his day. The Second Empire masterpieces of Charles Garnier‚Äîthe Paris Opera House and the Monte Carlo Casino ‚Äîseem to have influenced Verity's design, which is carried out in stone, now painted, and is composed of a central face slightly recessed between wings, all similar in width and three storeys high. As originally completed, however, the first two storeys of the central face contained a great round-arched opening forming the deeply recessed entrance to the restaurant. In each wing the first two storeys have three-bay openings, wide between narrow, flanked by wide piers. In the ground storey these piers are plain, but those above are dressed with segmental-pedimented niches containing statues. A pedestal, with enriched panels in its die, underlines the lofty third storey where the central face has a group of three round-arched windows, their moulded archivolts rising from entablatures above plain piers flanked by Ionic half-columns. Carved in the spandrels are draped female figures, holding festoons looped below oblong tablets. In each of the wings paired Corinthian plain-shafted pilasters flank an Ionic Venetian window, its arched middle light being of the same size as those in the central face, with a fan-shaped lunette of wide and narrow panels, the former ornamented and the latter plain. Restaurant incorporates semi-precious stones such as jade, mother of pearl, turquoise. The main entablature has an enriched architrave, a plain frieze except for the carved panels in the breaks above the Corinthian pilasters, and a dentilled and modillioned cornice which is returned to form large triangular pediments over the two wings. The high pedestal-parapet, its die enriched with ornamented panels, is a typically French feature, and so are the high pavilion roofs over the wings, with two tiers of dormers. These, and the single-storey roof over the centre, are crested with railings of ornamental ironwork. One of the restaurant's most famous features is the Long Bar, which retains the 'glistering' ceiling of gold mosaic, coved at the sides and patterned all over with lines and ornaments in blue and white tesserae. The wall decoration accords well with the real yellow gold leaf ceiling, being lined with warm marble and formed into blind arcades with semi-elliptical arches resting on slender octagonal columns, their unmolded capitals and the impost being encrusted with goldground mosaic. Reception Under the ownership of Georgian entrepreneur Irakli Sopromadze, in July 2009 Marina O'Loughlin reviewed the restaurant for Metro, saying that \\"The Criterion is the star of the show\\", but criticised the \\"dodgy oligarch taste: the crushed-red velvet love seats, the metal statues that look like they‚Äôve been liberated from TK Maxx, the unflattering lighting\\". O'Loughlin felt the food was \\"infinitely better than the food we endured during Marco Pierre White's reign\\". Giles Coren from The Times reviewed the restaurant using his Twitter account awarding his overall experience a mark of 8/10. The Criterion won the \\"Best London Restaurant 2011\\" award having been voted in at first place by the dining community. In 2014, the restaurant held a \\"Certificate of Excellence\\" on TripAdvisor, awarded to leading dining establishments based on a strict ratings system. Since December 2015 restaurant has reopened as Savini at Criterion serving an all day classical Milanese menu. Jay Rayner from The Observer has reviewed Savini as depressing and unnecessary citing \\"clumsy cooking\\" and \\"the ludicrous prices\\" attributing dessert as a \\"contender for both worst and most overpriced dessert in London\\". Tanya Gold for The Spectator described Savini's food as dull and too ordinary noting as if \\"serving expensive Italian food is not its real ‚Äî or rather, primary ‚Äî purpose, which is more likely communing with dead pastry chefs\\" and \\"only seven tables are occupied in a sea of tables\\". Ownership In 1992, after extensive refurbishment, the room was re-opened under the management of Bob Payton's My Kinda Town Restaurant Group as The Criterion Brasserie. My Kinda Town ran the restaurant until July 1995 when the lease was taken by Marco Pierre White who arranged for it to be refurbished by top interior designer, David Collins. In 2009 Criterion Restaurant was bought by Irakli Sopromadze of VINS Holdings carrying out a \\"gentle and sympathetic\\" restoration of the venue including the refurbishment of the premises and upgrading of the kitchen and equipment. Irakli Sopromadze relaunched the restaurant in May 2009 and planned to acquire other restaurant opportunities in central London. In June 2015, decision was made to place the restaurant into administration following a rent review decision resulting in 60% rental uplift and as of August 2015 restaurant remained closed. In December 2015, the Gatto's family, owner of the Savini Restaurant in Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan, reopened the restaurant with the name of Savini At Criterion. It has been announced that the Savini Restaurant will close on 27 June 2018 reopening as a new restaurant at the end of July 2018. As of February 2020, it remains permanently closed.

Life The family removed to Brooklyn when Patrick was still a child. He attended Public School Nr. 17 in Brooklyn. Then he became a cooper, and later an oil inspector. He married Kate Hogan (died 1883), a school teacher, and they had five children who all died in infancy. He was a member of the New York State Assembly (Kings Co., 6th D.) in 1882 and 1883. Then he studied law, and was admitted to the bar, but did not open a law office, and very rarely appeared in court. He was again a member of the State Assembly in 1889; and a member of the New York State Senate (4th D.) from 1890 to 1893, sitting in the 113th, 114th, 115th and 116th New York State Legislatures.

In 1900 he proposed another bridge across the East River, between the existing Brooklyn Bridge and Manhattan Bridge. McCarren was considered the Boss of Brooklyn's Democratic organization by 1909, and Brookyln's Democrats were known for guarding their independence from that of Tammany Hall in Manhattan. Their motto under McCarren was, \\"The Tiger Shall Not Cross The Bridge\\". Patrick McCarren owned and raced Thoroughbred horses. He died on October 23, 1909, in St. Catherine's Hospital, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Greenpoint Park in Brooklyn was renamed McCarren Park in his honor.

The term was first coined by Alexander von Humboldt and formalised by the International Botanical Congress in 1910. An association can be viewed as a real, integrated entity shaped either by species interactions or by similar habitat requirements, or it can be viewed as merely a common point along a continuum. The former view was championed by American ecologist Frederic Clements, who viewed the association as a whole that was more than the sum of its parts, and by Josias Braun-Blanquet, a Swiss-born phytosociologist. On the other end of the argument was American ecologist Henry Gleason, who saw these groupings of plant species as a coincidence produced by the \\"fluctuation and fortuitous immigration of plants, and an equally fluctuating and variable environment\\".Gleason (1935), cited in Barbour et al. 1999, p. 184 p.23 References Further reading * Category:Community ecology Category:Habitats Category:Ecology terminology Category:Habitat ","title":"Association (ecology)"},{"id":"37994133","text":"The Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, also known as the Assumption Church, in Plattenville is a historic Roman Catholic church which was built in 1856.

It has also been described as a solution lake. The south end can be seen from Kawhia Rd and, when the north end is full, it can be seen from the point which is at the end of Plateau Rd on the Pipiwharauroa Way. It is the largest known polje in the country.  Lake formation, volcanism and limestone  Lake Disappear lies in a valley dammed by a lava flow (similar to the one which also formed Bridal Veil waterfall - see map below) and drained through a limestone sinkhole. The lava flow, which covered the limestone, was part of the Okete Volcanics about 2 million years ago, coming from a vent on Whataipu (see map), just over a kilometre away. Page 43 of the 'Geology of the Raglan-Kawhia Area' says, ‚ÄúOnly a few specific areas within the larger catchments are prone to flooding where river flow is restricted, most notably at Lake Disappear (R15/795635 [now on Topo maps BD32 & BE32]) Here, the Pakoka River [should be Pakihi ‚Äì Pakoka is the next valley with Bridal Veil fall] drains underground through limestone (Elgood Limestone). During times of prolonged heavy rain, water backs up behind the outlet to form a sizable lake over what are normally dry alluvial flats.‚ÄùGeology of the Raglan-Kawhia Area: Institute of Geological & Nuclear Sciences (N.Z.), Barry Clayton Waterhouse, P. J. White 1994 Elgood Limestone (an outcrop is in the photo - see Gallery - to the left) is part of the Glen Massey Formation. The geology guide describes it as, ‚Äúforming prominent bluffs or surface outcrops displaying solution channels, lapiez, and sinkholes, and is everywhere a light grey, flaggy limestone containing up to 95% CaCO3. Glauconite is common throughout, together with Mesozoic pebbles and greensand near the base‚Äù. About its late Whaingaroan (about 27 million years ago) creation, it says, ‚ÄúThe change from estuarine, shallow brackish water conditions (Mangakotuku Formation), to fully marine, open sea, aerobic conditions (Glen Massey Formation) is evidenced by near shore accumulation of the bioclastic Elgood Limestone, onlap of the succeeding Dunphail Siltstone, and subsequent deposition of Ahirau Sandstone in an inner to mid shelf environment.‚Äù  Biota  Pakihi is a MƒÅori term now commonly used to describe poorly drained, infertile land. Much of the watershed of Lake Disappear was podocarp forest but is now mostly sheep and beef farms, with Te Uku Wind Farm around the source. A 1999 survey reported the lake-bed as dominated by adventive pasture species, with some indigenous sedges, and a remnant of secondary kahikatea forest. A survey for the windfarm described the Pakihi, 2 km up from the Lake (site PR2), as having poor to moderate ecological health, indicated by significant growths of long-green filamentous algae. Landcare Research says, ‚ÄúEnrichment of the water with nutrients causes algal blooms, and changes the algal community from a slowgrowing, diverse mixture into one dominated by problem algae like thick filamentous mats‚Äù.http://www.landcareresearch.co.nz/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/41418/chp_8_nutrients.pdf Inanga, longfin eel, koura (freshwater crayfish), freshwater snails, shrimps and banded kokopu have been found in the stream and Kaoro Climbing galaxias (Galaxias brevipinnis) may be present.

Life and work  Youth and World War I (1886 to 1918)  Freybe was born the son of a butcher. He attended the Schiller High School in Stettin to Grade 7. From 1902 to 1904, he completed an apprenticeship as a butcher. From 1907 to 1908 he served on the West Pomeranian 38th Field Artillery Regiment. In 1910 he passed the certification test, then worked as a butcher with his father in Stettin. In 1912 he started his own business, and was married the same year. From August 1914, Freybe served in World War I, and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the reserves. He was awarded Iron Cross medals (1st and 2nd class).  Weimar and Nazi era (1919 to 1945)  After World War I, Freybe was a member of the German Mittelstand (Middle Class Party). In the May 1928 Reichstag election, Freybe was elected a representative for Pomerania, a seat which he held for two legislative periods, until July 1932. He worked particularly hard for the interests of his own profession, but also worked for the interests of manual trades in general and the industrial middle class. Freybe also worked for craft and trade organizations. He was chairman of the German Butchers Association for Pomerania in 1928 as well as head of the Stettin Butchers' Guild from 1928 to 1935. In 1934 he was appointed \\"Honorary Master of (all) Trades in Pomerania\\". In the Second World War Freybe served as an officer in various capacities. His wife was killed in August 1944 during an air raid on Stettin. The Freybe family home, built in 1891 and containing Freybe's company offices, was also destroyed.  Post-War Period  After Stettin became part of Poland in 1945, Freybe started a new business in Hanover. In addition, Freybe worked for the German Butchers Association, of which he became the deputy chairman in 1950. In 1978, the Butchers Association created the Carl Freybe Medal, awarded every three years. Carl Freybe later joined the FDP, running unsuccessfully in the Lower Saxony slate of candidates in the 1953 national election. In 1957 he became the chairman of the Union of German Middle Class Parties. As chairman, he ran unsuccessfully as the lead candidate in the 1957 national election.  Publications  * I saw Canada.

Church is a historic African Methodist church at 2321 Thalia in New Orleans, Louisiana. The Gothic Revival building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. Like the Connectional African Methodist Episcopal Church Union Bethel was born out of sociological differences. In 1862 a small band of sixty (60) dissatisfied Christians led by a local preacher, Rev. William Foster, withdrew from St. James AME Church under a \\"sort of social and religious struggle between free mulattos and free blacks. The first place was located at Camp and Clio Streets and they called it \\"Bethel,\\" meaning \\"God is in this house.\\" Between 1866 and 1883, eleven pastors served and the membership fluctuated as they worshipped in several places. In 1883, the congregation purchased the lot at Thalia and South Liberty Streets, the present location. They built a wooden structure which served as both a church and a school. In 1903 the church was officially incorporated under the name of Union Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church of New Orleans. In 1906 this building burned to the ground. The foundation for the present church was laid in 1910 and the cornerstone is dated June 18, 1911. The upper level of the building was completed in 1921. The Rev. William A. McClendon BD. was the Pastor in 1926. He was responsible for raising significant funds for the church. In 1929 a building located at 1323 South Liberty Street was purchased and served as the first parsonage. During this period of growth, building and expansion Reverends Green B. Billops, W. A. Easton and J. B. Bell served as pastors. It was in 1941 that Bishop Sherman Lawrence Greene appointed Reverend Howard Thomas Primm pastor of Union Bethel. He served as pastor from 1941‚Äì1952. This was a period of great growth and expansion. Union Bethel became known as the seven day a week church During his pastorate at Union Bethel Reverend Primm established the Sarah Allen Child Development Center, This program set the pattern for Child Care across the City of New Orleans and later throughout the AME Church Connection. The Center was self-sustaining and received no funding from outside sources. In addition, he established the Edythe M. Primm Well Baby Clinic which employed a physician, two registered nurses, one student nurse and one clerk and the Primrose New-Life Building. At the General Conference of 1952 Reverend Primm was elevated to the Episcopacy of the AME Church. The Reverend George Napoleon Collins was assigned to Union Bethel following Bishop Primm. He worked with the congregation to organize and build St. Matthew A.M.E. Church in Ponchatoula, Louisiana. He organized the Foreign Aid Board which gave support to the overseas districts. Rev. Collins was elevated to position of Presiding Elder and then to the Episcopacy of the AME Church. It was the Rev. T. W. Gaines, a son of the church, who led the congregation in the installation the beautiful stained windows. His faithful attention to the sick and shut-in was one of the greatest strengths of his pastorate. During the administration of The Reverend Lutrelle Grice Long, renowned preacher, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. made his second proclamation against segregation and the use of public facilities when he was denied use of the Municipal Auditorium of New Orleans. Rev. Long opened the doors of Union Bethel to Dr. King. It was during this period during the height of civil rights movement numerous activities took place at Union Bethel. It was under his leadership the church was restored after having endured a horrific fire that gutted the building in 1962 and was restored in the fall of 1963. The Reverend Nelson Pryor Patterson brought with him an emphasis on following the Discipline of the AME Church. He displayed a concern for others and inspired a new spirit of cooperation within the \\"family\\". As a result, Bro. Sidney Collier initiated the Celestial Drive which to the liquidation of the indebtedness of the church and parsonage. During the administration of the Reverend Lorenzo G. Clarke the fellowship hall and the main sanctuary were renovated. He emphasized the development of the Youth Department, organized the Cathedral Choir and initiated the 8 am worship service. November 1982 Bishop Frank Curtis Cummings assigned the Reverend Thomas Benjamin Brown, Jr. as pastor of Union Bethel.

History The first church in Quednau was a Roman Catholic pilgrimage church for fishermen and sailors built in 1268. Measuring 25 m long and 12.5 m wide, it was built atop the hill Quednauer Berg and dedicated to Saint James the Greater. In 1320 a pastor Hermann was mentioned. Dismantled in 1507, the church was rebuilt at the foot of the hill by 1509 with the support of Grand Master Frederick of Saxony. This second church was built in the Gothic style with plastered fieldstones. The church was converted to Lutheranism in 1525 with the creation of the Duchy of Prussia. It was subsequently rebuilt after a storm in 1687. During the occupation of K√∂nigsberg at the end of the War of the Fourth Coalition, Quednau Church was used as a stable by French troops. The church's roof was damaged by windthrow in 1818; it was eventually closed from 1828 to 1830 for repairs. The steeple was restored in 1853 after a lightning strike, and from 1870 to 1880 the entire church was renovated. The church was noted for its numerous gravestones and epitaphs from the 17th and 18th centuries. The interior also featured a stellar vault. The pulpit was designed by Johann Christoph D√∂bel in 1687. Near the pulpit was the alleged armor of Henning Schindekopf. It contained two bells; one cast in 1710 hangs in the St. Martini Church in Stockheim/Hann. Quednau Church was destroyed in 1945 during the Battle of K√∂nigsberg.
